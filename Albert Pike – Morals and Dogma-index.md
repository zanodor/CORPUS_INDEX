An Introduction to Bro. Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma
By Bro. Jay Halpern
My acquaintance with Pike's work, "Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of
Freemasonry", was a matter of chance. I happened upon it in an antique center and was immediately drawn to its erudition, its scope and its willingness to portray the sort of symbolism and arcana that
drew me to Freemasonry in the first place.
I determined to let his words speak for themselves, and play upon my own knowledge of American and world history, philosophy and political theory to make their point. What I found, much to my delight,
was how far Pike's work took me beyond the parameters of pure Masonic lore and into the realm of political and economic theory that had been trod by the greatest minds of the past, like Plato, Plutarch,
and the philosophical synthesizers of all ages.
It became clear to me, in this regard, that M&D was far more than a Masonic tract. Pike placed Freemasonry and its structure and symbols within two very broad contexts: the religious and spiritual
history of the world, stretching far beyond even the building of Solomon's Temple; and the human drama of vanquished peoples coping with the oppressive moral and political climate of defeat in war.
For I think it's impossible to understand the significance of M&D without perceiving Pike's spiritual and philosophical outcry against the predations made against the former Confederacy of the American
South by the conquering armies and politicians of the United States federal government.
Albert Pike was a Confederate general of high moral principles, as is evident throughout M&D. We in the North have been schooled in the history of the victor; the story of the origins of the conflict
between the states would, of course, have been written very differently had the fortunes of war gone differently. Having been taught the principle of loyalty to one's national government from childhood,
we in the north find it difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of the Confederate rebellion as anything other than an act of betrayal of national principles, a breaking of the most sacred trust that had been
forged between states by blood spilled during our mutual revolution from England. Pike writes in the very beginning of M&D: "The nations are not bodiespolitic alone, but also soulspolitic; and woe to
that people which, seeking the material only, forgets that it has a soul. A free people, forgetting that it has a soul to be cared for, devotes all its energies to its material advancement. If it make war, it is to
subserve its commercial interests. The citizens copy after the State, and regard wealth, pomp, and luxury as the great goods of life. Such a nation creates wealth rapidly, and distributes it badly. Thence
the two extremes, of monstrous opulence and monstrous misery; all the enjoyment to a few, all the privations to the rest, that is to say, to the people; Privilege, Exception, Monopoly, Feudality, springing
up from Labor itself: a false and dangerous situation, which, making Labor a blinded and chained Cyclops, in the mine, at the forge, in the workshop, at the loom, in the field, over poisonous fumes, in
miasmatic cells, in unventilated factories, founds public power upon private misery, and plants the

greatness of the State in the suffering of the individual. It is a greatness ill constituted, in which all the material elements are combined, and into which no moral element enters. If a people, like a star, has
the right of eclipse, the light ought to return. The eclipse should not degenerate into night."
To Pike's way of thinking, the Southern agrarian economy had purposefully eschewed the ways of industrialization and the market forces that had been so warmly embraced by the North. What Albert
Pike saw in his own time was the forced encrustation of an agrarian, democratic dream by an imposed industrial capitalism from the North, and he saw himself as spokesman for a free people, now under
tyranny, clutching to save its soul.
Pike regarded Masonry as a potential framework upon which to retain the noblest and highest ideals once held by the defeated South. Hear his words, then, written in occupation and defeat, regarding this
Brotherhood: "And Masonry, like History and Philosophy, has eternal duties eternal, and, at the same time, simple. The people that would be Free and Independent, must possess Sagacity, Forethought,
foresight, and careful Circumspection, all which are included in the meaning of the word Prudence. It must be temperate in asserting its rights, temperate in its councils, economical in its expenses; it must
be bold, brave, courageous, patient under reverses, undismayed by disasters, hopeful amid calamities. She must, above all things, be just, not truckling to the strong and warring on or plundering the weak;
she must act on the square with all nations, and the feeblest tribes; always keeping her faith, honest in her legislation, upright in all her dealings. Whenever such a Republic exists, it will be immortal: for
rashness, injustice, intemperance and luxury in prosperity, and despair and disorder in adversity, are the causes of the decay and dilapidation of nations."
Albert Pike was a man of broad scholarship, comfortably familiar with the great documents of history,
and familiar with the reports of human anthropology and sociology written, with varying degrees of insight and accuracy, by scholars and historians from all times and places. There isn't an indigenous
culture, whether primitive or advanced, that Pike doesn't applaud to the degree that its native peoples adhere to the tenets of yeoman culture, of honesty and brotherhood from soul to soul. Indeed, Pike
quite clearly states that Masonic ideals transcend all eras and peoples. In his chapter on the Royal Arch of Solomon, he writes, "Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history, with its present
Degrees, further than the year 1700, if so far. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country, Masonry existed as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon built
the temple, but centuries before before even the first colonies emigrated into Southern India, Persia, and Egypt, from the cradle of the human race." (Italics the author)
Principle Transcends Degree Work and Ritual
Thus, to Pike, the principles he found in Freemasonry far transcended the petty formalism of degree

work and ritual. He looked into the past for role models whose lives best represented what he considered Masonic ideals, and philosophies that represented what he felt were meaningful paradigms
for living the good and virtuous life. His search was broad and unprejudiced and he remarked regarding the appropriateness of holy texts as one of the Great Lights of a Lodge: "The Hebrew
Pentateuch in a Hebrew Lodge, and the Koran in a Mohammedan one, belong on the Altar; and one of these, and the Square and Compass, properly understood, are the Great Lights by which a Mason must
walk and work."
Pike saw in this Masonic ideal the restatement of the Eleusinian Mysteries, and Orphism, and ythagoreanism, and the noble, secret faiths of every ancient generation viewed in its best and most
profound light. "We have no other concern with your religious creed," Pike states outright, but for swearing oaths on whatever document commands one's particular heartfelt honor.
Pike is drawn to the symbols of Freemasonry, drawn as they are from the most ancient occult creeds,
for two reasons. The first reason derives from his status as a defeated general, a man of honor residing under what he perceives as a tyranny of occupation. Pike writes, "Despots are an aid to thinkers.
Speech enchained is speech terrible.
The writer doubles and triples his style, when silence is imposed by a master upon the people. There springs from this silence a certain mysterious fullness, which filters and freezes into brass in his
thoughts." Thus, living under the despotism of the federal U.S., Pike writes his tome compressed between blocks of symbols and arcana that disguise his ancillary intent, to write a missive that will
keep the idealism of the South alive during occupation.
Pike heralds a warning to his Southern brethren that there will be a price to pay if their path is lost. History demonstrates that nations in their hour of darkest need, turn to the worst rulers: "We should
naturally suppose that a nation in distress would take counsel with the wisest of its sons. But, on the contrary, great men seem never so scarce as when they are most needed, and small men never so bold to
insist on infesting place, as when mediocrity and incapable pretence and sophomoric greenness, and showy and sprightly incompetency are most dangerous." The result, of course, is that revolutions
begun for the purpose of empowering the people, result in new tyrannies: the rule of Cromwell, of Napoleon, of Stalin. Pike adds rather boldly, "That is a sad and true allegory which represents the
companions of Ulysses changed by the enchantments of Circe into swine," meaning by Ulysses, of course, Ulysses S. Grant, the new "tyrant" over the South.
"The North Ruled With An Iron Fist.."

The fact that the U.S. federal government is, itself, a republic, and not a tyranny, doesn't let if off the hook, in Pike's view; the economic system of the North rules with a tyrant's fist: When civil war tears
the vitals of a Republic, let it look back and see if it has not been guilty of injustices; and if it has, let it humble itself in the dust!"
From Pike's perspective, it is the mercantile system of industrial politics, in contradistinction to the
agrarian idealism of the South, that caused the rupture between the states and propelled the nation into civil war. The restrictions established against the expansion of slavery into the new territories of the
West, for example, appeared to Southern gentry like Pike to be a serious and unmitigated infringement upon what they took to be the backbone of the Constitutional compromise, the balance between states'
rights and federal authority. And in back of that infringement lay industrial mercantilism, the rank capitalism that was to lead to the Gilded Age, the Age of Morgan and Astor and Gould and the rest of
the Robber Barons. And, of course, we are not Masons living in the South during Reconstruction; we are not defeated warriors living under occupation. The past is still the past, and therein lies, in my
opinion, a great deal of the intellectual fascination Pike's work holds for me, as a Mason. As I read his work, I try and extrapolate just how such a man of both word and deed could be expected to make his
theories manifest themselves in the worldatlarge. He is charged by many with helping to found the Ku Klux Klan, an active resistance movement against the federal forces stationed throughout the South. I
can well imagine Pike putting deeds to his words and, when faced with the apolitical stance of Masonry then and now, seeking to found a similar body, an offshoot with degrees and symbols and occult titles,
that would more vigorously pursue a spiritual cum political transformation throughout the South. But I'd find it difficult to imagine the Klansman as we know him today, ignorant, selfimportant,
anarchistic, hateful against all religions and races other than his own, to be the kind of soldier Pike would have called to his spiritual cause. Perhaps the KKK was an experiment that failed in its infancy
and went off in the wrong direction, a subterranean cell of political and spiritual theorists turned redneck racists at the starting gate. I can then imagine Pike even more disgruntled and perhaps
misanthropic after his years of theorizing and propagating his philosophy.
An Infinite Variety of Mankind...
It is evident from the symbolic portions of M&D that Pike was too intrigued by the infinite variety of mankind, its religions, its cultures, its spiritual struggles against the forces of darkness, to be blithely
classed with the racists we have come to expect from a racist culture. It is true that in some societies Pike allows for slavery; didn't, in fact, the whole Greek and Roman world, packed full of philosophers,
depend upon it as an institution? Pike writes, "Influence of man over man is a law of nature, whether it be by a great estate in land or in intellect. It may mean slavery, a deference to the eminent human
judgment (italics mine)." He writes elsewhere, "The wiser a man becomes, the less will he be inclined to submit tamely to the imposition of fetters or a yoke, on his conscience or his person. For, by
increase of wisdom he not only better knows his rights, but the more highly values them, and is more conscious of his worth and dignity. His pride then urges him to assert his independence. He becomes

better able to assert it also; and better able to assist others or his country, when they or she stake all, even existence, upon the same assertion. In Pike's day there was neither theory nor technology for
social redemption. Certain forms of maladaptive behavior, certain affects of acculturation, were considered irredeemable and, at best, served as lessons to the rest of us who weren't so afflicted. In
other words, slaves are both the victims of their masters, and by remaining enslaved, eventually deteriorate until they are worthy of their slavery. Don't mistake, however, my attempting to understand
Pike's conception of slavery given his philosophy and spirituality with a justification. It is here that Pike and I part company, just as I part company with Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, whose philosophic
leisure depended upon a slavebased culture. I merely wish to paint as broad a portrait of the man who wrote M&D as I can, given my studies so far.
I can sympathize with Archie Stone's perplexity; here, in this remarkable book, sidebyside with
drawings of occult symbols, Hebrew icons, Masonic forms, and all manner of diagrams and arcana, is embedded a political and social tract that is the proudly defiant outcry of one man against a nation that
has overrun his own. It's easy for me to understand the veneration in which Pike's held by Masons in the Southern Jurisdiction; he represents, to them, the epitome of Southern aristocratic learning,
philosophy and values. His words ring, and will always ring, alongside all other worldclass philosophers who saw their societies crumbling from greed and mercantilism. It will, I'm sure, surprise
some that a Northern Masonic Jew, a man with ingrained Northern and urban sympathies for multiculturalism and the enlightened use of technology, could glean so much from a man like Albert
Pike, a man so different. But I feel that, at bottom, the spiritual truths that have always brought true Masons together, whether in formal Lodge or by informal happenstance, with or without Masonic
sanction, are truths that we both share and for whose fullness and radiance we continue to search. That part of contemporary Masonry which falls short of these truths, would, I feel, disturb Pike as much as
they disturb me. I can only wish to meet and mingle with brothers who will pursue more light in Masonry with the passion, erudition and reverence that Albert Pike put into his impressive work.

MORALS AND DOGMA. by Albert Pike
I. APPRENTICE
THE TWELVEINCH RULE AND THE COMMON GAVEL.
FORCE, unregulated or illregulated, is not only wasted in the void, like that of gunpowder burned in
the open air, and steam unconfined by science; but, striking in the dark, and its blows meeting only the air, they recoil and bruise itself. It is destruction and ruin. It is the volcano, the earthquake, the
cyclone;not growth and progress. It is Polyphemus blinded, striking at random, and falling headlong among the sharp rocks by the impetus of his own blows.
The blind Force of the people is a Force that must be economized, and also managed, as the blind Force
of steam, lifting the ponderous iron arms and turning the large wheels, is made to bore and rifle the cannon and to weave the most delicate lace. It must be regulated by Intellect. Intellect is to the people
and the people's Force, what the slender needle of the compass is to the shipits soul, always counselling the huge mass of wood and iron, and always pointing to the north. To attack the citadels
built up on all sides against the human race by superstitions, despotisms, and prejudices, the Force must have a brain and a law. Then its deeds of daring produce permanent results, and there is real progress.
Then there are sublime conquests. Thought is a force, and philosophy should be an energy, finding its aim and its effects in the amelioration of mankind.
The two great motors are Truth and Love. When all these Forces are combined, and guided by the
Intellect, and regulated by the RULE of Right, and Justice, and of combined and systematic movement and effort, the great revolution prepared for by the ages will begin to march. The POWER of the Deity
Himself is in equilibrium with His WISDOM. Hence the only results are HARMONY.
It is because Force is ill regulated, that revolutions prove failures. Therefore it is that so often insurrections, coming from those high mountains that domineer over the moral horizon, Justice,
Wisdom, Reason, Right, built of the purest snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock, after having reflected the sky in their transparency, and been swollen by a hundred affluents, in the majestic
path of triumph, suddenly lose themselves in quagmires, like a California river in the sands. The onward march of the human race requires that the heights around it should blaze with noble and
enduring lessons of courage. Deeds of daring dazzle history, and form one class of the guiding lights of man. They are the stars and coruscations from that great sea of electricity, the Force inherent in the
people. To strive, to brave all risks, to perish, to persevere, to be true to one's self, to grapple body to body with destiny, to surprise defeat by the little terror it inspires, now to confront unrighteous power,
now to defy intoxicated triumphthese are the examples that the nations need and the light that electrifies them.

There are immense Forces in the great caverns of evil beneath society; in the hideous degradation,
squalor, wretchedness and destitution, vices and crimes that reek and simmer in the darkness in that populace below the people, of great cities. There disinterestedness vanishes, every one howls, searches,
gropes, and gnaws for himself. Ideas are ignored, and of progress there is no thought. This populace has two mothers, both of them stepmothersIgnorance and Misery. Want is their only guidefor the
appetite alone they crave satisfaction. Yet even these may be employed.
The lowly sand we trample upon, cast into the furnace, melted, purified by fire, may become resplendent crystal. They have the brute force of the HAMMER, but their blows help on the great
cause, when struck within the lines traced by the RULE held by wisdom and discretion.
Yet it is this very Force of the people, this Titanic power of the giants, that builds the fortifications of tyrants, and is embodied in their armies. Hence the possibility of such tyrannies as those of which it has
been said, that "Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sulla. Under Claudius and under Domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the uglinessof the tyranny. The foulness of
the slaves is a direct result of the atrocious baseness of the despot. A miasma exhales from these crouching consciences that reflect the master; the public authorities are unclean, hearts are collapsed,
consciences shrunken, souls puny. This is so under Caracalla, it is so under Commodus, it is so under Heliogabalus, while from the Roman senate, under Caesar, there comes only the rank odour peculiar to
the eagle's eyrie."
It is the force of the people that sustains all these despotisms, the basest as well as the best. That force acts through armies; and these oftener enslave than liberate. Despotism there applies the RULE. Force
is the MACE of steel at the saddlebow of the knight or of the bishop in armour. Passive obedience by force supports thrones and oligarchies, Spanish kings, and Venetian senates. Might, in an army wielded
by tyranny, is the enormous sum total of utter weakness; and so Humanity wages war against Humanity, in despite of Humanity. So a people willingly submits to despotism, and its workmen submit to be
despised, and its soldiers to be whipped; therefore it is that battles lost by a nation are often progress attained. Less glory is more liberty. When the drum is silent, reason sometimes speaks.
Tyrants use the force of the people to chain and subjugatethat is, enyoke the people. Then they plough
with them as men do with oxen yoked. Thus the spirit of liberty and innovation is reduced by bayonets, and principles are struck dumb by cannonshot; while the monks mingle with the troopers, and the
Church militant and jubilant, Catholic or Puritan, sings Te Deums for victories over rebellion.
The military power, not subordinate to the civil power, again the HAMMER or MACE of FORCE, independent of the RULE, is an armed tyranny, born fullgrown, as Athene sprung from the brain of

Zeus. It spawns a dynasty, and begins with Caesar to rot into Vitellius and Commodus. At the present day it inclines to begin where formerly dynasties ended.
Constantly the people put forth immense strength, only to end in immense weakness. The force of the
people is exhausted in indefinitely prolonging things long since dead; in governing mankind by embalming old dead tyrannies of Faith; restoring dilapidated dogmas; regilding faded, wormeaten
shrines; whitening and rouging ancient and barren superstitions; saving society by multiplying parasites; perpetuating superannuated institutions; enforcing the worship of symbols as the actual
means of salvation; and tying the dead corpse of the Past, mouth to mouth, with the living Present. Therefore it is that it is one of the fatalities of Humanity to be condemned to eternal struggles with
phantoms, with superstitions, bigotries, hypocrisies, prejudices, the formulas of error, and the pleas of tyranny. Despotisms, seen in the past, become respectable, as the mountain, bristling with volcanic
rock, rugged and horrid, seen through the haze of distance is blue and smooth and beautiful. The sight of a single dungeon of tyranny is worth more, to dispel illusions, and create a holy hatred of despotism,
and to direct FORCE aright, than the most eloquent volumes. The French should have preserved the Bastile as a perpetual lesson; Italy should not destroy the dungeons of the Inquisition. The Force of the
people maintained the Power that built its gloomy cells, and placed the living in their granite sepulchres.
The FORCE of the people cannot, by its unrestrained and fitful action, maintain and continue in action
and existence a free Government once created. That Force must be limited, restrained, conveyed by distribution into different channels, and by roundabout courses, to outlets, whence it is to issue as the
law, action, and decision of the State; as the wise old Egyptian kings conveyed in different canals, by subdivision, the swelling waters of the Nile, and compelled them to fertilize and not devastate the land.
There must be the jus et norma, the law and Rule, or Gauge, of constitution and law, within which the public force must act. Make a breach in either, and the great steamhammer, with its swift and
ponderous blows, crushes all the machinery to atoms, and, at last, wrenching itself away, lies inert and dead amid the ruin it has wrought.
The FORCE of the people, or the popular will, in action and exerted, symbolized by the GAVEL,
regulated and guided by and acting within the limits of LAW and ORDER, symbolized by the TWENTYFOURINCH RULE, has for its fruit LIBERTY, EQUALITY, and FRATERNITY,liberty
regulated by law; equality of rights in the eye of the law; brotherhood with its duties and obligations as well as its benefits.
You will hear shortly of the Rough ASHLAR and the Perfect ASHLAR, as part of the jewels of the
Lodge. The rough Ashlar is said to be "a stone, as taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state." The perfect Ashlar is said to be "a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the
workingtools of the FellowCraft." We shall not repeat the explanations of these symbols given by the
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



11/641
York Rite. You may read them in its printed monitors. They are declared to allude to the self improvement of the individual craftsman,a continuation of the same superficial interpretation.
The rough Ashlar is the PEOPLE, as a mass, rude and unorganized. The perfect Ashlar, or cubical
stone, symbol of perfection, is the STATE, the rulers deriving their powers from the consent of the governed; the constitution and laws speaking the will of the people; the government harmonious,
symmetrical, efficient, its powers properly distributed and duly adjusted in equilibrium.
If we delineate a cube on a plane surface thus:
we have visible three faces, and nine external lines, drawn between seven points. The complete cube has three more faces, making six; three more lines, making twelve; and one more point, making eight. As
the number 12 includes the sacred numbers, 3, 5, 7, and 3 times 3, or 9, and is produced by adding the sacred number 3 to 9; while its own two figures, 1, 2, the unit or monad, and duad, added together,
make the same sacred number 3; it was called the perfect number; and the cube became the symbol of perfection.
Produced by FORCE, acting by RULE; hammered in accordance with lines measured by the Gauge, out
of the rough Ashlar, it is an appropriate symbol of the Force of the people, expressed as the constitution and law of the State; and of the State itself the three visible faces represent the three departments,the
Executive, which executes the laws; the Legislative, which makes the laws; the Judiciary, which interprets the laws, applies and enforces them, between man and man, between the State and the
citizens. The three invisible faces, are Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, the threefold soul of the State its vitality, spirit, and intellect.
Though Masonry neither usurps the place of, nor apes religion, prayer is an essential part of our
ceremonies. It is the aspiration of the soul toward the Absolute and Infinite Intelligence, which is the One Supreme Deity, most feebly and misunderstandingly characterized as an "ARCHITECT." Certain
faculties of man are directed toward the Unknownthought, meditation, prayer. The unknown is an ocean, of which conscience is the compass. Thought, meditation, prayer, are the great mysterious
pointings of the needle. It is a spiritual magnetism that thus connects the human soul with the Deity. These majestic irradiations of the soul pierce through the shadow toward the light.
It is but a shallow scoff to say that prayer is absurd, because it is not possible for us, by means of it, to
persuade God to change His plans. He produces foreknown and foreintended effects, by the instrumentality of the forces of nature, all of which are His forces. Our own are part of these. Our free
agency and our will are forces. We do not absurdly cease to make efforts to attain wealth or happiness, prolong life, and continue health, because we cannot by any effort change what is predestined. If the

effort also is predestined, it is not the less our effort, made of our free will. So, likewise, we pray. Will is a force. Thought is a force. Prayer is a force. Why should it not be of the law of God, that prayer, like
Faith and Love, should have its effects? Man is not to be comprehended as a startingpoint, or progress as a goal, without those two great forces, Faith and Love. Prayer is sublime. Orisons that beg and
clamour are pitiful. To deny the efficacy of prayer, is to deny that of Faith, Love, and Effort. Yet the effects produced, when our hand, moved by our will, launches a pebble into the ocean, never cease; and
every uttered word is registered for eternity upon the invisible air.
Every Lodge is a Temple, and as a whole, and in its details symbolic. The Universe itself supplied man with the model for the first temples reared to the Divinity. The arrangement of the Temple of Solomon,
the symbolic ornaments which formed its chief decorations, and the dress of the HighPriest, all had reference to the order of the Universe, as then understood. The Temple contained many emblems of the
seasonsthe sun, the moon, the planets, the constellations Ursa Major and Minor, the zodiac, the elements, and the other parts of the world. It is the Master of this Lodge, of the Universe, Hermes, of
whom Khurum is the representative, that is one of the lights of the Lodge.
For further instruction as to the symbolism of the heavenly bodies, and of the sacred numbers, and of the temple and its details, you must wait patiently until you advance in Masonry, in the mean time
exercising your intellect in studying them for yourself. To study and seek to interpret correctly the symbols of the Universe, is the work of the sage and philosopher. It is to decipher the writing of God,
and penetrate into His thoughts.
This is what is asked and answered in our catechism, in regard to the Lodge. * * * * * *
A "Lodge" is defined to be "an assemblage of Freemasons, duly congregated, having the sacred writings, square, and compass, and a charter, or warrant of constitution, authorizing them to work." The
room or place in which they meet, representing some part of King Solomon's Temple, is also called the Lodge; and it is that we are now considering.
It is said to be supported by three great columns, WISDOM, FORCE or STRENGTH, and BEAUTY,
represented by the Master, the Senior Warden, and the Junior Warden; and these are said to be the columns that support the Lodge, "because Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, are the perfections of
everything, and nothing can endure without them." "Because," the York Rite says, "it is necessary that there should be Wisdom to conceive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn, all great and important
undertakings." "Know ye not," says the Apostle Paul, "that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man desecrate the temple of God, him shall God destroy, for the temple
of God is holy, which temple ye are."

The Wisdom and Power of the Deity are in equilibrium. The laws of nature and the moral laws are not the mere despotic mandates of His Omnipotent will; for, then they might be changed by Him, and order
become disorder, and good and right become evil and wrong; honesty and loyalty, vices; and fraud, ingratitude, and vice, virtues. Omnipotent power, infinite, and existing alone, would necessarily not be
constrained to consistency. Its decrees and laws could not be immutable. The laws of God are not obligatory on us because they are the enactments of His POWER, or the expression of His WILL; but
because they express His infinite WISDOM. They are not right because they are His laws, but His laws because they are right. From the equilibrium of infinite wisdom and infinite force, results perfect
harmony, in physics and in the moral universe. Wisdom, rower, and Harmony constitute one Masonic triad. They have other and profounder meanings, that may at some time be unveiled to you.
As to the ordinary and commonplace explanation, it may be added, that the wisdom of the Architect is
displayed in combining, as only a skillful Architect can do, and as God has done everywhere,for example, in the tree, the human frame, the egg, the cells of the honeycombstrength, with grace,
beauty, symmetry, proportion, lightness, ornamentation. That, too, is the perfection of the orator and poetto combine force, strength, energy, with grace of style, musical cadences, the beauty of figures,
the play and irradiation of imagination and fancy; and so, in a State, the warlike and industrial force of the people, and their Titanic strength, must be combined with the beauty of the arts, the sciences, and
the intellect, if the State would scale the heights of excellence, and the people be really free. Harmony in this, as in all the Divine, the material, and the human, is the result of equilibrium, of the sympathy
and opposite action of contraries; a single Wisdom above them holding the beam of the scales. To reconcile the moral law, human responsibility, freewill, with the absolute power of God; and the
existence of evil with His absolute wisdom, and goodness, and mercy, these are the great enigmas of the Sphynx.
You entered the Lodge between two columns. They represent the two which stood in the porch of the
Temple, on each side of the great eastern gateway. These pillars, of bronze, four fingers breadth in thickness, were, according to the most authentic accountthat in the First and that in the Second Book
of Kings, confirmed in Jeremiah eighteen cubits high, with a capital five cubits high. The shaft of each was four cubits in diameter. A cubit is one foot and 707/1000. That is, the shaft of each was a little
over thirty feet eight inches in height, the capital of each a little over eight feet six inches in height, and the diameter of the shaft six feet ten inches. The capitals were enriched by pomegranates of bronze,
covered by bronze network, and ornamented with wreaths of bronze; and appear to have imitated the shape of the seedvessel of the lotus or Egyptian lily, a sacred symbol to the Hindus and Egyptians. The
pillar or column on the right, or in the south, was named, as the Hebrew word is rendered in our translation of the Bible, JACHIN: and that on the left BOAZ. Our translators say that the first word
means, "He shall establish;" and the second, "In it is strength."
These columns were imitations, by Khurum, the Tyrian artist, of the great columns consecrated to the Winds and Fire, at the entrance to the famous Temple of Malkarth, in the city of Tyre. It is customary,

in Lodges of the York Rite, to see a celestial globe on one, and a terrestrial globe on the other; but these are not warranted, if the object be to imitate the original two columns of the Temple. The symbolic
meaning of these columns we shall leave for the present unexplained, only adding that Entered Apprentices keep their workingtools in the column JACHIN; and giving you the etymology and literal
meaning of the two names.
The word JACHIN, in Hebrew, probably pronounced Yakayan, and meant, as a verbal noun, He that strengthens; and thence, firm, stable, upright.
The word BOAZ is Baaz which means Strong, Strength, Power, Might, Refuge, Source of Strength, a
Fort. The prefix means "with" or "in," and gives the word the force of the Latin gerund, roborando Strengthening
The former word also means he will establish, or plant in an erect positionfrom the verb Kun, he stood
erect. It probably meant Active and Vivifying Energy and Force; and Boaz, Stability, Permanence, in the passive sense.
The Dimensions of the Lodge, our Brethren of the York Rite say, "are unlimited, and its covering no
less than the canopy of Heaven." "To this object," they say, "the mason's mind is continually directed, and thither he hopes at last to arrive by the aid of the theological ladder which Jacob in his vision saw
ascending from earth to Heaven; the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity; and which admonish us to have Faith in God, Hope in Immortality, and Charity to all
mankind." Accordingly a ladder, sometimes with nine rounds, is seen on the chart, resting at the bottom on the earth, its top in the clouds, the stars shining above it; and this is deemed to represent that mystic
ladder, which Jacob saw in his dream, set up on the earth, and the top of it reaching to Heaven, with the angels of God ascending and descending on it. The addition of the three principal rounds to the
symbolism, is wholly modern and incongruous.
The ancients counted seven planets, thus arranged: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. There were seven heavens and seven spheres of these planets; on all the monuments of
Mithras are seven altars or pyres, consecrated to the seven planets, as were the seven lamps of the golden candelabrum in the Temple. That these represented the planets, we are assured by Clemens of
Alexandria, in his Stromata, and by Philo Judaeus.
To return to its source in the Infinite, the human soul, the ancients held, had to ascend, as it had descended, through the seven spheres. The Ladder by which it reascends, has, according to Marsilius
Ficinus, in his Commentary on the Ennead of Plotinus, seven degrees or steps; and in the Mysteries of Mithras, carried to Rome under the Emperors, the ladder, with its seven rounds, was a symbol referring

to this ascent through the spheres of the seven planets. Jacob saw the Spirits of God ascending and descending on it; and above it the Deity Himself. The Mithraic Mysteries were celebrated in caves,
where gates were marked at the four equinoctial and solstitial points of the Zodiac; and the seven planetary spheres were represented, which souls needs must traverse in descending from the heaven of
the fixed stars to the elements that envelop the earth; and seven gates were marked, one for each planet, through which they pass, in descending or returning.
We learn this from Celsus, in Origen, who says that the symbolic image of this passage among the
stars, used in the Mithraic Mysteries, was a ladder reaching from earth to Heaven, divided into seven steps or stages, to each of which was a gate, and at the summit an eighth one, that of the fixed stars. The
symbol was the same as that of the seven stages of Borsippa, the Pyramid of vitrified brick, near Babylon, built of seven stages, and each of a different colour. In the Mithraic ceremonies, the candidate
went through seven stages of initiation, passing through many fearful trialsand of these the high ladder with seven rounds or steps was the symbol.
You see the Lodge, its details and ornaments, by its Lights. You have already heard what these Lights,
the greater and lesser, are said to be, and how they are spoken of by our Brethren of the York Rite.
The Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses, are not only styled the Great Lights in Masonry, but they are also technically called the Furniture of the Lodge; and, as you have seen, it is held that there is no
Lodge without them. This has sometimes been made a pretext for excluding Jews from our Lodges, because they cannot regard the New Testament as a holy book. The Bible is an indispensable part of the
furniture of a Christian Lodge, only because it is the sacred book of the Christian religion. The Hebrew Pentateuch in a Hebrew Lodge, and the Koran in a Mohammedan one, belong on the Altar; and one of
these, and the Square and Compass, properly understood, are the Great Lights by which a Mason must walk and work.
The obligation of the candidate is always to be taken on the sacred book or books of his religion, that he
may deem it more solemn and binding; and therefore it was that you were asked of what religion you were. We have no other concern with your religious creed.
The Square is a right angle, formed by two right lines. It is adapted only to a plane surface, and belongs
only to geometry, earthmeasurement, that trigonometry which deals only with planes, and with the earth, which the ancients supposed to be a plane. The Compass describes circles, and deals with
spherical trigonometry, the science of the spheres andheavens. The former, therefore, is an emblem of what concerns the earth and the body; the latter of what concerns the heavens and the soul. Yet the
Compass is also used in plane trigonometry, as in erecting perpendiculars; and, therefore, you are reminded that, although in this Degree both points of the Compass are under the Square, and you are

now dealing only with the moral and political meaning of the symbols, and not with their philosophical and spiritual meanings, still the divine ever mingles with the human; with the earthly the spiritual
intermixes; and there is something spiritual in the commonest duties of life. The nations are not bodies politic alone, but also soulspolitic; and woe to that people which, seeking the material only, forgets that
it has a soul. Then we have a race, petrified in dogma, which presupposes the absence of a soul and the presence only of memory and instinct, or demoralized by lucre. Such a nature can never lead
civilization. Genuflexion before the idol or the dollar atrophies the muscle which walks and the will which moves. Hieratic or mercantile absorption diminishes the radiance of a people, lowers its horizon
by lowering its level, and deprives it of that understanding of the universal aim, at the same time human and divine, which makes the missionary nations. A free people, forgetting that it has a soul to be cared
for, devotes all its energies to its material advancement. If it makes war, it is to subserve its commercial interests. The citizens copy after the State, and regard wealth, pomp, and luxury as the great goods of
life. Such a nation creates wealth rapidly, and distributes it badly. Thence the two extremes, of monstrous opulence and monstrous misery; all the enjoyment to a few, all the privations to the rest, that
is to say, to the people; Privilege, Exception, Monopoly, Feudality, springing up from Labour itself: a false and dangerous situation, which, making Labour a blinded and chained Cyclops, in the mine, at the
forge, in the workshop, at the loom, in the field, over poisonous fumes, in miasmatic cells, in unventilated factories, founds public power upon private misery, and plants the greatness of the State in
the suffering of the individual. It is a greatness ill constituted, in which all the material elements are combined, and into which no moral element enters. If a people, like a star, has the right of eclipse, the
light ought to return. The eclipse should not degenerate into night.
The three lesser, or the Sublime Lights, you have heard, are the Sun, the Moon, and the Master of the Lodge; and you have heard what our Brethren of the York Rite say in regard to them, and why they hold
them to be Lights of the Lodge. But the Sun and Moon do in no sense light the Lodge, unless it be symbolically, and then the lights are not they, but those things of which they are the symbols. Of what
they are the symbols the Mason in that Rite is not told. Nor does the Moon in any sense rule the night with regularity.
The Sun is the ancient symbol of the lifegiving and generative power of the Deity. To the ancients,
light was the cause of life; and God was the source from which all light flowed; the essence of Light, the Invisible Fire, developed as Flame manifested as light and splendour. The Sun was His
manifestation and visible image; and the Sabaeans worshipping the LightGod, seemed to worship the Sun, in whom they saw the manifestation of the Deity.
The Moon was the symbol of the passive capacity of nature to produce, the female, of which the life
giving power and energy was the male. It was the symbol of Isis, Astarte, and Artemis, or Diana. The "Master of Life" was the Supreme Deity, above both, and manifested through both; Zeus, the Son of
Saturn, become King of the Gods; Horus, son of Osiris and Isis, become the Master of Life; Dionusos or Bacchus, like Mithras, become the author of Light and Life and Truth.

*****
The Master of Light and Life, the Sun and the Moon, are symbolized in every Lodge by the Master and
Wardens: and this makes it the duty of the Master to dispense light to the Brethren, by himself, and through the Wardens, who are his ministers.
"Thy sun," says ISAIAH to Jerusalem, "shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself;
for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever." Such is the type of a free people.
Our northern ancestors worshipped this triune Deity; ODIN, the Almighty FATHER; FREA, his wife,
emblem of universal matter; and THOR, his son, the mediator. But above all these was the Supreme God, "the author of everything that existeth, the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and Awful Being, the
Searcher into concealed things, the Being that never changeth." In the Temple of Eleusis (a sanctuary lighted only by a window in the roof, and representing the Universe), the images of the Sun, Moon, and
Mercury, were represented.
"The Sun and Moon," says the learned Bro. DELAUNAY, "represent the two grand principles of all generations, the active and passive, the male and the female. The Sun represents the actual light. He
pours upon the Moon his fecundating rays; both shed their light upon their offspring, the Blazing Star, or HORUS, and the three form the great Equilateral Triangle, in the centre of which is the omnific letter
of the Kabalah, by which creation is said to have been effected."
The ORNAMENTS of a Lodge are said to be "the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star." The Mosaic Pavement, chequered in squares or lozenges, is said to represent the ground
floor of King Solomon's Temple; and the Indented Tessel "that beautiful tessellated border which surrounded it." The Blazing Star in the centre is said to be "an emblem of Divine Providence, and
commemorative of the star which appeared to guide the wise men of the East to the place of our Saviour's nativity." But "there was no stone seen" within the Temple. The walls were covered with
planks of cedar, and the floor was covered with planks of fir.
There is no evidence that there was such a pavement or floor in the Temple, or such a bordering. In England, anciently, the TracingBoard was surrounded with an indented border; and it is only in
America that such a border is put around the Mosaic pavement. The tesserae, indeed, are the squares or lozenges of the pavement. In England, also, "the indented or denticulated border" is called "tessellated,"
because it has four "tassels," said to represent Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. It was

18/641
termed the Indented Trassel; but this is a misuse of words. It is a tesserated pavement, with an indented border round it.
The pavement, alternately black and white, symbolizes, whether so intended or not, the Good and Evil
Principles of the Egyptian and Persian creed. It is the warfare of Michael and Satan, of the Gods and Titans, of Balder and Lok; between light and shadow, which is darkness; Day and Night; Freedom and
Despotism; Religious Liberty and the Arbitrary Dogmas of a Church that thinks for its votaries, and whose Pontiff claims to be infallible, and the decretals of its Councils to constitute a gospel.
The edges of this pavement, if in lozenges, will necessarily be indented or denticulated, toothed like a
saw; and to complete and finish it a bordering is necessary. It is completed by tassels as ornaments at the corners. If these and the bordering have any symbolic meaning, it is fanciful and arbitrary.
To find in the BLAZING STAR of five points an allusion to the Divine Providence, is also fanciful; and
to make it commemorative of the Star that is said to have guided the Magi, is to give it a meaning comparatively modern. Originally it represented SIRIUS, or the Dogstar, the forerunner of the
inundation of the Nile; the God ANUBIS, companion of ISIS in her search for the body of OSIRIS, her brother and husband. Then it became the image of HORUS, the son of OSIRIS, himself symbolized
also by the Sun, the author of the Seasons, and the God of Time; Son of ISIS, who was the universal nature, himself the primitive matter, inexhaustible source of Life, spark of uncreated fire, universal seed
of all beings. It was HERMES, also, the Master of Learning, whose name in Greek is that of the God Mercury. It became the sacred and potent sign or character of the Magi, the PENTALPHA, and is the
significant emblem of Liberty and Freedom, blazing with a steady radiance amid the weltering elements of good and evil of Revolutions, and promising serene skies and fertile seasons to the nations,
after the storms of change and tumult.
In the East of the Lodge, over the Master, inclosed in a triangle, is the Hebrew letter YOD. In the English and American Lodges the Letter G is substituted for this, as the initial of the word GOD, with
as little reason as if the letter D., initial of DIEU, were used in French Lodges instead of the proper letter. YOD is, in the Kabalah, the symbol of Unity, of the Supreme Deity, the first letter of the Holy
Name; and also a symbol of the Great Kabalistic Triads. To understand its mystic meanings, you must open the pages of the Sohar and Siphra de Zeniutha, and other kabalistic books, and ponder deeply on
their meaning. It must suffice to say, that it is the Creative Energy of the Deity, is represented as a point, and that point in the centre of the Circle of immensity. It is to us in this Degree, the symbol of
that unmanifested Deity, the Absolute, who has no name.
Our French Brethren place this letter YOD in the centre of the Blazing Star. And in the old Lectures, our ancient English Brethren said, "The Blazing Star or Glory in the centre refers us to that grand
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



19/641
luminary, the Sun, which enlightens the earth, and by its genial influence dispenses blessings to mankind." They called it also in the same lectures, an emblem of PRUDENCE. The word Prudentia
means, in its original and fullest signification, Foresight; and, accordingly, the Blazing Star has been regarded as an emblem of Omniscience, or the Allseeing Eye, which to the Egyptian Initiates was the
emblem of Osiris, the Creator. With the YOD in the centre, it has the kabalistic meaning of the Divine Energy, manifested as Light, creating the Universe.
The Jewels of the Lodge are said to be six in number. Three are called "Movable," and three
"Immovable." The SQUARE, the LEVEL, and the PLUMB were anciently and properly called the Movable Jewels, because they pass from one Brother to another. It is a modern innovation to call them
immovable, because they must always be present in the Lodge. The immovable jewels are the ROUGH ASHLAR, the PERFECT ASHLAR or CUBICAL, STONE, or, in some Rituals, the DOUBLE CUBE,
and the TRACINGBOARD, or TRESTLEBOARD.
Of these jewels our Brethren of the York Rite say: "The Square inculcates Morality; the Level, Equality; and the Plumb, Rectitude of Conduct." Their explanation of the immovable Jewels may be read in their
monitors.
Our Brethren of the York Rite say that "there is represented in every wellgoverned Lodge, a certain point, within a circle; the point representing an individual Brother; the Circle, the boundary line of his
conduct, beyond which he is never to suffer his prejudices or passions to betray him."
This is not to interpret the symbols of Masonry. It is said by some, with a nearer approach to interpretation, that the point within the circle represents God in the centre of the Universe. It is a
common Egyptian sign for the Sun and Osiris, and is still used as the astronomical sign of the great luminary. In the Kabalah the point is YOD, the Creative Energy of God, irradiating with light the
circular space which God, the universal Light, left vacant, wherein to create the worlds, by withdrawing His substance of Light back on all sides from one point.
Our Brethren add that, "this circle is embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing Saint
John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, and upon the top rest the Holy Scriptures" (an open book). "In going round this circle," they say, "we necessarily touch upon these two lines as well as upon
the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err."
It would be a waste of time to comment upon this. Some writers have imagined that the parallel lines
represent the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which the Sun alternately touches upon at the Summer and Winter solstices. But the tropics are not perpendicular lines, and the idea is merely fanciful. If the
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



20/641
parallel lines ever belonged to the ancient symbol, they had some more recondite and more fruitful meaning. They probably had the same meaning as the twin columns Jachin and Boaz. That meaning is
not for the Apprentice. The adept may find it in the Kabalah. The JUSTICE and MERCY of God are in equilibrium, and the result is HARMONY, because a Single and Perfect Wisdom presides over both.
The Holy Scriptures are an entirely modern addition to the symbol, like the terrestrial and celestial
globes on the columns of the portico. Thus the ancient symbol has been denaturalized by incongruous additions, like that of Isis weeping over the broken column containing the remains of Osiris at Byblos.

Masonry has its decalogue, which is a law to its Initiates. These are its Ten Commandments:
I. God is the Eternal, Omnipotent, Immutable WISDOM and Supreme INTELLIGENCE and
Exhaustless Love. Thou shalt adore, revere, and love Him! Thou shalt honour Him by practising the virtues!
II. Thy religion shall be, to do good because it is a pleasure to thee, and not merely because it is a duty.
That thou mayest become the friend of the wise man, thou shalt obey his precepts! Thy soul is immortal! Thou shalt do nothing to degrade it!
III. Thou shalt unceasingly war against vice! Thou shalt not do unto others that which thou wouldst not
wish them to do unto thee! Thou shalt be submissive to thy fortunes, and keep burning the light of wisdom!
IV. Thou shalt honour thy parents! Thou shalt pay respect and homage to the aged! Thou shalt instruct
the young! Thou shalt protect and defend infancy and innocence!
V. Thou shalt cherish thy wife and thy children! Thou shalt love thy country, and obey its laws!
VI. Thy friend shall be to thee a second self! Misfortune shall not estrange thee from him! Thou shalt do for his memory whatever thou wouldst do for him, if he were living!
VII. Thou shalt avoid and flee from insincere friendships! Thou shalt in everything refrain from excess.
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



21/641
Thou shalt fear to be the cause of a stain on thy memory!
VIII. Thou shalt allow no passions to become thy master! Thou shalt make the passions of others profitable lessons to thyself! Thou shalt be indulgent to error!
IX. Thou shalt hear much: Thou shalt speak little: Thou shalt act well! Thou shalt forget injuries! Thou
shalt render good for evil! Thou shalt not misuse either thy strength or thy superiority!
X. Thou shalt study to know men; that thereby thou mayest learn to know thyself! Thou shalt ever seek after virtue ! Thou shalt be just! Thou shalt avoid idleness!
But the great commandment of Masonry is this: "A new commandment give I unto you: that ye love
one another! He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, remaineth still in the darkness."
Such are the moral duties of a Mason. But it is also the duty of Masonry to assist in elevating the moral and intellectual level of society; in coining knowledge, bringing ideas into circulation, and causing the
mind of youth to grow; and in putting, gradually, by the teachings of axioms and the promulgation of positive laws, the human race in harmony with its destinies.
To this duty and work the Initiate is apprenticed. He must not imagine that he can effect nothing, and,
therefore, despairing, become inert. It is in this, as in a man's daily life. Many great deeds are done in the small struggles of life. There is, we are told, a determined though unseen bravery, which defends
itself, foot to foot, in the darkness, against the fatal invasion of necessity and of baseness. There are noble and mysterious triumphs, which no eye sees, which no renown rewards, which no flourish of
trumpets salutes. Life, misfortune, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are battlefields, which have their heroes,heroes obscure, but sometimes greater than those who become illustrious. The Mason should
struggle in the same manner, and with the same bravery, against those invasions of necessity and baseness, which come to nations as well as to men. He should meet them, too, foot to foot, even in the
darkness, and protest against the national wrongs and follies; against usurpation and the first inroads of that hydra, Tyranny. There is no more sovereign eloquence than the truth in indignation. It is more
difficult for a people to keep than to gain their freedom. The Protests of Truth are always needed. Continually, the right must protest against the fact. There is, in fact, Eternity in the Right. The Mason
should be the Priest and Soldier of that Right. If his country should be robbed of her liberties, he should still not despair. The protest of the Right against the Fact persists forever. The robbery of a people never
becomes prescriptive. Reclamation of its rights is barred by no length of time. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teutonic. A people may endure military usurpation, and subjugated States
kneel to States and wear the yoke, while under the stress of necessity; but when the necessity disappears, if the people is fit to be free, the submerged country will float to the surface and reappear,

and Tyranny be adjudged by History to have murdered its victims.
Whatever occurs, we should have Faith in the Justice and overruling Wisdom of God, and Hope for the Future, and Loving kindness for those who are in error. God makes visible to men His will in events; an
obscure text, written in a mysterious language. Men make their translations of it forthwith, hasty, incorrect, full of faults, omissions, and misreadings. We see so short a way along the arc of the great
circle! Few minds comprehend the Divine tongue. The most sagacious, the most calm, the most profound, decipher the hieroglyphs slowly; and when they arrive with their text, perhaps the need has
long gone by; there are already twenty translations in the public squarethe most incorrect being, as of course, the most accepted and popular. From each translation, a party is born; and from each
misreading, a faction. Each party believes or pretends that it has the only true text, and each faction believes or pretends that it alone possesses the light. Moreover, factions are blind men, who aim
straight, errors are excellent projectiles, striking skillfully, and with all the violence that springs from false reasoning, wherever a want of logic in those who defend the right, like a defect in a cuirass, makes
them vulnerable.
Therefore it is that we shall often be discomfited in combating error before the people. Antaeus long resisted Hercules; and the heads of the Hydra grew as fast as they were cut off. It is absurd to say that
Error, wounded, writhes in pain, and dies amid her worshippers. Truth conquers slowly. There is a wondrous vitality in Error. Truth, indeed, for the most part, shoots over the heads of the masses; or if an
error is prostrated for a moment, it is up again in a moment, and as vigorous as ever. It will not die when the brains are out, and the most stupid and irrational errors are the longestlived.
Nevertheless, Masonry, which is Morality and Philosophy, must not cease to do its duty. We never know
at what moment success awaits our effortsgenerally when most unexpectednor with what effect our efforts are or are not to be attended. Succeed or fail, Masonry must not bow to error, or succumb under
discouragement. There were at Rome a few Carthaginian soldiers, taken prisoners, who refused to bow to Flaminius, and had a little of Hannibal's magnanimity. Masons should possess an equal greatness of
soul. Masonry should be an energy; finding its aim and effect in the amelioration of mankind. Socrates should enter into Adam, and produce Marcus Aurelius, in other words, bring forth from the man of
enjoyments, the man of wisdom. Masonry should not be a mere watchtower, built upon mystery, from which to gaze at ease upon the world, with no other result than to be a convenience for the curious. To
hold the full cup of thought to the thirsty lips of men; to give to all the true ideas of Deity; to harmonize conscience and science, are the province of Philosophy. Morality is Faith in full bloom. Contemplation
should lead to action, and the absolute be practical; the ideal be made air and food and drink to the human mind. Wisdom is a sacred communion. It is only on that condition that it ceases to be a sterile
love of Science, and becomes the one and supreme method by which to unite Humanity and arouse it to concerted action. Then Philosophy becomes Religion.

And Masonry, like History and Philosophy, has eternal duties eternal, and, at the same time, simple to oppose Caiaphas as Bishop, Draco or Jefferies as Judge, Trimalcion as Legislator, and Tiberius as
Emperor. These are the symbols of the tyranny that degrades and crushes, and the corruption that defiles and infests. In the works published for the use of the Craft we are told that the three great tenets
of a Mason's profession, are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. And it is true that a Brotherly affection and kindness should govern us in all our intercourse and relations with our brethren; and a generous and
liberal philanthropy actuate us in regard to all men. To relieve the distressed is peculiarly the duty of Masonsa sacred duty, not to be omitted, neglected, or coldly or inefficiently complied with. It is also
most true, that Truth is a Divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue. To be true, and to seek to find and learn the Truth, are the great objects of every good Mason.
As the Ancients did, Masonry styles Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice, the four cardinal
virtues. They are as necessary to nations as to individuals. The people that would be Free and Independent, must possess Sagacity, Forethought, Foresight, and careful Circumspection, all which are
included in the meaning of the word Prudence. It must be temperate in asserting its rights, temperate in its councils, economical in its expenses; it must be bold, brave, courageous, patient under reverses,
undismayed by disasters, hopeful amid calamities, like Rome when she sold the field at which Hannibal had his camp. No Cannae or Pharsalia or Pavia or Agincourt or Waterloo must discourage her. Let her
Senate sit in their seats until the Gauls pluck them by the beard. She must, above all things, be just, not truckling to the strong and warring on or plundering the weak; she must act on the square with all
nations, and the feeblest tribes; always keeping her faith, honest in her legislation, upright in all her dealings. Whenever such a Republic exists, it will be immortal: for rashness, injustice, intemperance
and luxury in prosperity, and despair and disorder in adversity, are the causes of the decay and dilapidation of nations.
II. THE FELLOWCRAFT
In the Ancient Orient, all religion was more or less a mystery and there was no divorce from it of philosophy. The popular theology, taking the multitude of allegories and symbols for realities,
degenerated into a worship of the celestial luminaries, of imaginary Deities with human feelings, passions, appetites, and lusts, of idols, stones, animals, reptiles. The Onion was sacred to the Egyptians,
because its different layers were a symbol of the concentric heavenly spheres. Of course the popular religion could not satisfy the deeper longings and thoughts, the loftier aspirations of the Spirit, or the
logic of reason. The first, therefore, was taught to the initiated in the Mysteries. There, also, it was taught by symbols. The vagueness of symbolism, capable of many interpretations, reached what the
palpable and conventional creed could not. Its indefiniteness acknowledged the abstruseness of the subject: it treated that mysterious subject mystically: it endeavored to illustrate what it could not
explain; to excite an appropriate feeling, if it could not develop an adequate idea; and to rmake the image a mere subordinate conveyance for the conception, which itself never became obvious or

familiar.
Thus the knowledge now imparted by books and letters, was of old conveyed by symbols; and the priests invented or perpetuated a display of rites and exhibitions, which were not only more attractive to
the eye than words, but often more suggestive and more pregnant with meaning to the mind.
Masonry, successor of the Mysteries, still follows the ancient manner of teaching. Her ceremonies are like the ancient mystic shows,not the reading of an essay, but the opening of a problem, requiring
research, and constituting philosophy the archexpounder. Her symbols are the instruction she gives. The lectures are endeavors, often partial and onesided, to interpret these symbols. He who would
become an accomplished Mason must not be content merely to hear, or even to understand, the lectures; he must, aided by them, and they having, as it were, marked out the way for him, study, interpret, and
develop these symbols for himself
******
Though Masonry is identical with the ancient Mysteries, it is so only in this qualified sense: that it presents but an imperfect image of their brilliancy, the ruins only of their grandeur, and a system that
has experienced progressive alterations, the fruits of social events, political circumstances, and the ambitious imbecility of its improvers.
After leaving Egypt, the Mysteries were modified by the habits of the different nations among whom
they were introduced, and especially by the religious systems of the countries into which they were transplanted. To maintain the established government, laws, and religion, was the obligation of the
Initiate everywhere; and everywhere they were the heritage of the priests, who were nowhere willing to make the common people coproprietors with themselves of philosophical truth.
Masonry is not the Coliseum in ruins. It is rather a Roman palace of the middle ages, disfigured by
modern architectural improvements, yet built on a Cyclopcean foundation laid by the Etruscans, and with many a stone of the superstructure taken from dwellings and temples of the age of Hadrian and
Antoninus.
Christianity taught the doctrine of FRATERNITY; but repudiated that of political EQUALITY, by continually inculcating obedience to Caesar, and to those lawfully in authority. Masonry was the first
apostle of EQUALITY. In the Monastery there is fraternity and equality, but no liberty. Masonry added that also, and claimed for man the threefold heritage, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, and FRATERNITY.

It was but a development of the original purpose of the Mysteries, which was to teach men to know and
practice their duties to themselves and their fellows, the great practical end of all philosophy and all knowledge.
Truths are the springs from which duties flow; and it is but a few hundred years since a new Truth
began to be distinctly seen; that MAN IS SUPREME OVER INSTITUTIONS, AND NOT THEY OVER HIM. Man has natural empire over all institutions. They are for him, aecording to his
development; not he for them. This seems to us a very simple statement, one to which all men, everywhere, ought to assent. But once it was a great new Truth, not revealed until governments had
been in existence for at least five thousand years. Once revealed, it imposed new duties on men. Man owed it to himself to be free. He owed it to his country to seek to give her freedom, or maintain her in
that possession. It made Tyranny and Usurpation the enemies of the Human Race. It created a general outlawry of Despots and Despotisms, temporal and spiritual. The sphere of Duty was immensely
enlarged. Patriotism had, henceforth, a new and wider meaning. Free Government, Free Thought, Free Conscience, Free Speech! All these came to be inalienable rights, which those who had parted with
them or been robbed of them, or whose ancestors had lost them, had the right summarily to retake. Unfortunately, as Truths always become perverted into falsehoods, and are falsehoods when misapplied,
this Truth became the Gospel of Anarchy, soon after it was first preached.
Masonry early comprehended this Truth, and recognized its own enlarged duties. Its symbols then came to have a wider meaning; but it also assumed the mask of Stonemasonry, and borrowed its working
tools, and so was supplied with new and apt symbols. It aided in bringing about the French Revolution, disappeared with the Girondists, was born again with the restoration of order, and sustained Napoleon,
because, though Emperor, he acknowledged the right of the people to select its rulers, and was at the head of a nation refusing to receive back its old kings. He pleaded, with sabre, musket, and cannon, the
great cause of the People against Royalty, the right of the French people even to make a Corsican General their Emperor, if it pleased them.
Masonry felt that this Truth had the Omnipotence of God on its side; and that neither Pope nor
Potentate could overcome it. It was a truth dropped into the world's wide treasury, and forming a part of the heritage which each generation receives, enlarges, and holds in trust, and of necessity bequeaths to
mankind; the personal estate of man, entailed of nature to the end of time. And Masonry early recognized it as true, that to set forth and develop a truth, or any human excellence of gift or growth, is
to make greater the spiritual glory of the race; that whosoever aids the march of a Truth, and makes the thought a thing, writes in the same line with MOSES, and with Him who died upon the cross; and has
an intellectual sympathy with the Deity Himself.
The best gift we can bestow on man is manhood. It is that which Masonry is ordained of God to bestow

on its votaries: not sectarianism and religious dogma; not a rudimental morality, that may be found in the writings of Confucius, Zoroaster, Seneca, and the Rabbis, in the Proverbs and Ecclesiastes; not a
little and cheap commonschool knowledge; but manhood and science and philosophy.
Not that Philosophy or Science is in opposition to Religion. For Philosophy is but that knowledge of God and the Soul, which is derived from observation of the manifested action of God and the Soul, and
from a wise analogy. It is the intellectual guide which the religious sentiment needs. The true religious philosophy of an imperfect being, is not a system of creed, but, as SOCRATES thought, an infinite
search or approximation. Philosophy is that intellectual and moral progress, which the religious sentiment inspires and ennobles.
As to Science, it could not walk alone, while religion was stationary. It consists of those matured
inferences from experience which all other experience confirms. It realizes and unites all that was truly valuable in both the old schemes of mediation, one heroic, or the system of action and effort; and the
mystical theory of spiritual, ccntemplative commullion. "Listen to me," says GALEN, "as to the voice of the Eleusinian Hierophant, and believe that the study of Nature is a mystery no less important than
theirs, nor less adapted to display the wisdom and power of the Great Creator. Their lessons and demonstrations were obscure, but ours are clear and unmistakable."
We deem that to be the best knowledge we can obtain of the Soul of another man, which is furnished by
his actions and his lifelong conduct. Evidence to the contrary, supplied by what another man informs us that this Soul has said to his, would weigh little against the former. The first Scriptures for the human
race were written by God on the Earth and Heavens. The reading of these Scriptures is Science. Familiarity with the grass and trees, the insects and the infusoria, teaches us deeper lessons of love and
faith than we can glean from the writings of FENELON and AUGUSTINE. The great Bible of God is ever open before mankind.
Knowledge is convertible into power, and axioms into rules of utility and duty. But knowledge itself is
not Power. Wisdom is Power; and her Prime Minister is JUSTICE, which is the perfected law of TRUTH. The purpose, therefore, of Education and Science is to make a man wise. If knowledge does
not make him so, it is wasted, like water poured on the sands. To know the formulas of Masonry, is of as little value, by itself, as to know so many words and sentences in some barbarous African or
Australasian dialect. To know even the meaning of the symbols, is but little, unless that adds to our wisdom, and also to our charity, which is to justice like one hemisphere of the brain to the other.
Do not lose sight, then, of the true object of your studies in Masonry. It is to add to your estate of
wisdom, and not merely to your knowledge. A man may spend a lifetime in studying a single specialty of knowledge, botany, conchology, or entomology, for instance,in committing to memory names

derived from the Greek, and classifying and reclassifying; and yet be no wiser than when he began. It is the great truths as to all that most concerns a man, as to his rights, interests, and duties, that Masonry
seeks to teach her Initiates.
The wiser a man becomes, the less will he be inclined to submit tamely to the imposition of fetters or a yoke, on his conscience or his person. For, by increase of wisdom he not only better knows his rights,
but the more highly values them, and is more conscious of his worth and dignity. His pride then urges him to assert his independence. He becomes better able to assert it also; and better able to assist others
or his country, when they or she stake all, even existence, upon the same assertion. But mere knowledge makes no one independent, nor fits him to be free. It often only makes him a more useful slave. Liberty
is a curse to the ignorant and brutal.
Political science has for its object to ascertain in what manner and by means of what institutions political and personal freedom may be secured and perpetuated: not license, or the mere right of every
man to vote, but entire and absolute freedom of thought and opinion, alike free of the despotism of monarch and mob and prelate; freedom of action within the limits of the general law enacted for all; the
Courts of Justice, with impartial Judges and juries, open to all alike; weakness and poverty equally potent in those Court.s as power and wealth; the avenues to office and honor open alike to all the
worthy; the military powers, in war of peace, in strict subordination to the civil power; arbitrary arrests for acts not known to the law as crimes, impossible; Romish Inquisitions, StarChambers, Military
Commissions, unknown; the means of instruction within reach of the children of all; the right of Free Speech; and accountability of all public omcers, civil and military.
If Masonry needed to be justified for imposing political as well as moral duties on its Initiates, it would
be enough to point to the sad history of the world. It would not even need that she should turn back the pages of history to the chapters written by Tacitus: that she should recite the incredible horrors of
despotism under Caligula and Domitian, Caracalla and Commodus, Vitellius and Maximin. She need only point to the centuries of calamity through which the gay French nation passed; to the long
oppression of the feudal ages, of the selfish Bourbon kings; to those times when the peasants were robbed and slaughtered by their own lords and princes, like sheep; when the lord claimed the firstfruits
of the peasant's marriagebed; when the captured city was given up to merciless rape and massacre; when the Stateprisons groaned with innocent victims, and the Church blessed the banners of pitiless
murderers, and sang Te Deums for the crowning mercy of the Eve of St. Bartholomew.
We might turn over the pages, to a later chapter, that of the reign of the Fifteenth Louis, when young girls, hardly more than children, were kidnapped to serve his lusts; when lettres de cachet filled the
Bastile with persons accused of no crime, with husbands who were in the way of the pleasures of lascivious wives and of villains wearing orders of nobility; when the people were ground between the
upper and the nether millstone of taxes, customs, and excises; and when the Pope's Nuncio and the

Cardinal de la RocheAyman, devoutly kneeling, one on each side of Madame du Barry, the king's abandoned prostitute, put the slippers on her naked feet, as she rose from the adulterous bed. Then,
indeed, suffering and toil were the two forms of man, and the people were but beasts of burden.
The true Mason is he who labors strenuously to help his Order effect its great purposes. Not that the Order can effect them by itself; but that it, too, can help. It also is one of God's instruments. It is a Force
and a Power; and shame upon it, if it did not exert itself, and, if need be, sacrihce its children in the cause of humanity, as Abraham was ready to offer up Isaac on the altar of sacrifice. It will not forget
that noble allegory of Curtius leaping, all in armor, into the great yawning gulf that opened to swallow Rome. It will TRY. It shall not be its fault if the day never comes when man will no longer have to fear
a conquest, an invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations with the armed hand, an interruption of civilization depending on a marriageroyal, or a birth in the hereditary tyrannies; a partition of the
peoples by a Congress, a dismemberment by the downfall of a dynasty, a combat of two religions, meeting head to head, like two goats of darkness on the bridge of the Infinite: when they will no longer
have to fear famine, spoliation, prostitution from distress, misery from lack of work, and all the brigandages of chance in the forest of events: when nations will gravitate about the Truth, like stars
about the light, each in its own orbit, without clashing or collision; and everywhere Freedom, cinctured with stars, crowned with the celestial splendors, and with wisdom and justice on either hand, will reign
supreme.
In your studies as a FellowCraft you must be guided by REASON, LOVE and FAITH.
We do not now discuss the differences between Reason and Faith, and undertake to define the domain of each. But it is necessary to say, that even in the ordinary affairs of life we are governed far more by
what we believe than by what we know; by FAITH and ANALOGY, than by REASON. The "Age of Reason" of the French Revolution taught, we know, what a folly it is to enthrone Reason by itself as
supreme. Reason is at fault when it deals with the Infinite. There we must revere and believe. Notwithstanding the calamities of the virtuous, the miseries of the deserving, the prosperity of tyrants
and the murder of martyrs, we must believe there is a wise, just, merciful, and loving God, an Intelligence and a Providence, supreme over all, and caring for the minutest things and events. A Faith
is a necessity to man. Woe to him who believes nothing!
We believe that the soul of another is of a certain nature and possesses certain qualities, that he is generous and honest, or penurious and knavish, that she is virtuous and amiable, or vicious and ill
tempered, from the countenance alone, from little more than a glimpse of it, without the means of knowing. We venture our fortune on the signature of a man on the other side of the world, whom we
never saw, upon the belief that he is honest and trustworthy. We believe that occurrences have taken place, upon the assertion of others. We believe that one will acts upon another, and in the reality of a
multitude of other phenomena that Reason cannot explain.

But we ought not to believe what Reason authoritatively denies, that at which the sense of right revolts,
that which is absurd or selfcontradictory, or at issue with experience or science, or that which degrades the character of the Deity, and would make Him revengeful, malignant, cruel, or unjust.
A man's Faith is as much his own as his Reason is. His Freedom consists as much in his faith being free
as in his will being uncontrolled by power. All the Priests and Augurs of Rome or Greece had not the right to require Cicero or Socrates to believe in the absurd mythology of the vulgar. All the Imaums of
Mohammedanism have not the right to require a Pagan to believe that Gabriel dictated the Koran to the Prophet. All the Brahmins that ever lived, if assembled in one conclave like the Cardinals, could not
gain a right to compel a single human being to believe in the Hindu Cosmogony. No man or body of men can be infallible, and authorized to decide what other men shall believe, as to any tenet of faith.
Except to those who first receive it, every religion and the truth of all inspired writings depend on human testimony and internal evidences, to be judged of by Reason and the wise analogies of Faith.
Each man must necessarily have the right to judge of their truth for himself; because no one man can have any higher or better right to judge than another of equal information and intelligence.
Domitian claimed to be the Lord God; and statues and images of him, in silver and gold, were found
throughout the known world. He claimed to be regarded as the God of all men; and, according to Suetonius, began his letters thus: "Our Lord and God commands that it should be done so and so;" and
formally decreed that no one should address him otherwise, either in writing or by word of mouth. Palfurius Sura, the philosopher, who was his chief delator, accusing those who refused to recognize his
divinity, however much he may have believed in that divinity, had not the right to demand that a single Christian in Rome or the provinces should do the same.
Reason is far from being the only guide, in morals or in political science. Love or lovingkindness must
keep it company, to exclude fanaticism, intolerance, and persecution, to all of which a morality too ascetic, and extreme political principles, invariably lead. We must also have faith in ourselves, and in
our fellows and the people, or we shall be easily discouraged by reverses, and our ardor cooled by obstacles. We must not listen to Reason alone. Force comes more from Faith and Love: and it is by the
aid of these that man scales the loftiest heights of morality, or becomes the Saviour and Redeemer of a People. Reason must hold the helm; but these supply the motive power. They are the wings of the soul.
Enthusiasm is generally unreasoning; and without it, and Love and Faith, there would have been no RIENZI, or TELL, or SYDNEY, or any other of the great patriots whose names are immortal. If the
Deity had been merely and only Allwise and Allmighty, He would never have created the Universe.

It is GENIUS that gets Power; and its prime lieutenants are FORCE and WISDOM. The unruliest of men bend before the leader that has the sense to see and the will to do. It is Genius that rules with God
like Power; that unveils, with its counsellors, the hidden human mysteries, cuts asunder with its word the huge knots, and builds up with its word the crumbled ruins. At its glance fall down the senseless
idols, whose altars have been on all the high places and in all the sacred groves. Dishonesty and imbecility stand abashed before it. Its single Yea or Nay revokes the wrongs of ages, and is heard
among the future generations. Its power is immense, because its wisdom is immense. Genius is the Sun of the political sphere. Force and Wisdom, its ministers, are the orbs that carry its light into darkness,
and answer it with their solid reflecting Truth.
Development is symbolized by the use of the Mallet and Chisel; the development of the energies and intellect, of the individual and the people. Genius may place itself at the head of an unintellectual,
uneducated, unenergetic nation; but in a free country, to cultivate the intellect of those who elect, is the only mode of securing intellect and genius for rulers. The world is seldom ruled by the great spirits,
except after dissolution and new birth. In periods of transition and convulsion, the Long Parliaments, the Robespierres and Marats, and the semirespectabilities of intellect, too often hold the reins of
power. The Cromwells and Napoleons come later. After Marius and Sulla and Cicero the rhetorician, CAESAR. The great intellect is often too sharp for the granite of this life. Legislators may be very
ordinary men; for legislation is very ordinary work; it is but the final issue of a million minds.
The power of the purse or the sword, compared to that of the spirit, is poor and contemptible. As to lands, you may have agrarian laws, and equal partition. But a man's intellect is all his own, held direct
from God, an inalienable fief. It is the most potent of weapons in the hands of a paladin. If the people comprehend Force in the physical sense, how much more do tlley revelence the intellectual! Ask
Hildebrand, or Luther, or Loyola. They fall prostrate before it, as before an idol. The mastery of mind over mind is the only conquest worth having. The other injures both, and dissolves at a breath; rude as it
is, the great cable falls down and snaps at last. But this dimly resembles the dominion of the Creator. It does not need a subject like that of Peter the Hermit. If the stream be but bright and strong, it will
sweep like a springtide to the popular heart. Not in word only, but in intellectual act lies the fascination. It is the homage to the Invisible. This power, knotted with Love, is the golden chain let
down into the well of Truth, or the invisible chain that binds the ranks of mankind together.
Influence of man over man is a law of nature, whether it be by a great estate in land or in intellect. It may mean slavery, a deference to the eminent human judgment. Society hangs spiritually together, like
the revolving spheres above. The free country, in which intellect and genius govern, will endure. Where they serve, and other influences govern, the national life is short. All the nations that have tried to
govern themselves by their smallest, by the incapables, or merely respectables, have come to nought. Constitutions and Laws, without Genius and Intellect to govern, will not prevent decay. In that case they
have the dryrot and the life dies out of them by degrees.

To give a nation the franchise of the Intellect is the only sure mode of perpetuating freedom. This will compel exertion and generous care for the people from those on the higher seats, and honorable and
intelligent allegiance from those below. Then political public life will protect all men from self abasement in sensual pursuits, from vulgar acts and low greed, by giving the noble ambition of just
imperial rule. To elevate the people by teaching lovingkindness and wisdom, with power to him who teaches best: and so to develop the free State from the rough ashlar: this is the great labor in which
Masonry desires to lend a helping hand.
All of us should labor in building up the great monument of a nation, the Holy House of the Temple. The cardinal virtues must not be partitioned among men, becoming the exclusive property of some, like
the common crafts. ALL are apprenticed to the partners, Duty and Honor.
Masonry is a march and a struggle toward the Light. For the individual as well as the nation, Light is Virtue, Manliness, Intelligence, Liberty. Tyranny over the soul or body, is darkness. The freest people,
like the freest man, is always in danger of relapsing into servitude. Wars are almost always fatal to Republics. They create tyrants, and consolidate their power. They spring, for the most part, from evil
counsels. When the small and the base are intrusted with power, legislation and administration become but two parallel series of errors and blunders, ending in war, calamity, and the necessity for a tyrant.
When the nation feels its feet sliding backward, as if it walked on the ice, the time has come for a supreme effort. The magnificent tyrants of the past are but the types of those of the future. Men and
nations will always sell themselves into slavery, to gratify their passions and obtain revenge. The tyrant's plea, necessity, is always available; and the tyrant once in power, the necessity of providing for
his safety makes him savage. Religion is a power, and he must control that. Independent, its sanctuaries might rebel. Then it becomes unlawful for the people to worship God in their own way, and the old
spiritual despotisms revive. Men must believe as Power wills, or die; and even if they may believe as they will, all they have, lands, houses, body, and soul, are stamped with the royal brand. "I am the State,
" said Louis the Fourteenth to his peasants; "the very shirts on your backs are mine, and I can take them if I will."
And dynasties so established endure, like that of the Caesars of Rome, of the Caesars of
Constantinople, of the Caliphs, the Stuarts, the Spaniards, the Goths, the Valois, until the race wears out, and ends with lunatics and idiots, who still rule. There is no concord among men, to end the
horrible bondage. The State falls inwardly, as well as by the outward blows of the incoherent elements. The furious human passions, the sleeping human indolence, the stolid human ignorance, the rivalry of
human castes, are as good for the kirlgs as the swords of the Paladins. The worshippers have all bowed so long to the old idol, that they cannot go into the streets and choose another Grand Llama. And so the
effete State floats on down the puddled stream of Time, until the tempest or the tidal sea discovers that the worm has consumed its strength, and it crumbles into oblivion.

Civil and religious Freedom must go hand in hand; and Persecution matures them both. A people content with the thoughts made for them by the priests of a church will be content with Royalty by
Divine Right, the Church and the Throne mutually sustaining each other. They will smother schism and reap infidelity and indifference; and while the battle for freedom goes on around them, they will only
sink the more apathetically into servitude and a deep trance, perhaps occasionally interrupted by furious fits of frenzy, followed by helpless exhaustion. Despotism is not dimcult in any land that has
only known one master from its childhood; but there is no harder problem than to perfect and perpetuate free government by the people themselves; for it is not one king that is needed: all must be
kings. It is easy to set up Masaniello, that in a few days he may fall lower than before. But free government grows slowly, like the individual human faculties; and like the foresttrees, from the inner
heart outward. Liberty is not only the common birthright, but it is lost as well by nonuser as by mis user. It depends far more on the universal effort than any other human property. It has no single shrine
or holy well of pilgrimage for the nation; for its waters should burst out freely from the whole soil.
The free popular power is one that is only known in its strength in the hour of adversity: for all its trials, sacrifices and expectations are its own. It is trained to think for itself, and also to act for itself. When
the enslaved people prostrate themselves in the dust before the hurricane, like the alarmed beasts of the field, the free people stand erect before it, in all the strength of unity, in selfreliance, in mutual
reliance, with effrontery against all but the visible hand of God. It is neither cast down by calamity nor elated by success.
This vast power of endurance, of forbearance, of patience, and of performance, is only acquired by
continual exercise of all the functions, like the healthful physical human vigor, like the individual moral vigor.
And the maxim is no less true than old, that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. It is curious to
observe the universal pretext by which the tyrants of all times take away the national liberties. It is stated in the statutes of Edward II., that the justices and the sheriff should no longer be elected by the
people, on account of the riots and dissensions which had arisen. The same reason was given long before for the suppression of popular election of the bishops; and there is a witness to this untruth in the
yet older times, when Rome lost her freedom, and her indignant citizens declared that tumultuous liberty is better than disgraceful tranquillity.

what are called GEOMETRY and TRIGONOMETRY, two words that are themselves deficient in meaning. GEOMETRY, which the letter G in most Lodges is said to signify, means measurement of
land or the earth or Surveying; and TRIGONOMETRY, the measurement of triangles, or figures with three sides or angles. The latter is by far the most appropriate name for the science intended to be
expressed by the word "Geometry." Neither is of a meaning sufficiently wide: for although the vast surveys of great spaces of the earth's surface, and of coasts, by which shipwreck and calamity to
mariners are avoided, are effected by means of triangulation; though it was by the same method that the French astronomers measured a degree of latitude and so established a scale of measures on an
immutable basis; though it is by means of the immense triangle that has for its base a line drawn in imagination between the place of the earth now and its place six months hence in space, and for its apex
a planet or star, that the distance of Jupiter or Sirius from the earth is ascertained; and though there is a triangle still more vast, its base extending either way from us, with and past the horizon into immensity,
and its apex infinitely distant above us; to which corresponds a similar infinite triangle below what is above equalling what is below, immensity equalling immensity; yet the Science of Numbers, to which
Pythagoras attached so much importance, and whose mysteries are found everywhere in the ancient religions, and most of all in the Kabalah and in the Bib]e, is not sufficiently expressed by either the
word "Geometry" or the word "Trigonometry." For that science includes theseJ with Arithmetic, and also with Algebra, Logarithms, the Integral and Differential Calculus; and by means of it are worked
out the great problems of Astronomy or the Laws of the Stars.

Virtue is but heroic bravery, to do the thing thought to be true, in spite of all enemies of flesh or spirit, in despite of all temptations or menaces. Man is accountable for the uprightness of his doctrine, but not
for the rightness of it. Devout enthusiasm is far easier than a good action. The end of thought is action; the sole purpose of Religion is an Ethic. Theory, in political science, is worthless, except for the
purpose of being realized in practice.
In every credo, religious or political as in the soul of man, there are two regions, the Dialectic and the Ethic; and it is only when the two are harmoniously blended, that a perfect discipline is evolved. There
are men who dialectically are Christians, as there are a multitude who dialectically are Masons, and yet who are ethically Infidels, as these are ethically of the Profane, in the strictest sense: intellectual
believers, but practical atheists: men who will write you "Evidences," in perfect faith in their logic, but cannot carry out the Christian or Masonic doctrine, owing to the strength, or weakness, of the flesh. On
the other hand, there are many dialectical skeptics, but ethical believers, as there are many Masons who have never undergone initiation; and as ethics are the end and purpose of religion, so are ethical
believers the most worthy. He who does right is better than he who thinks right.

with their sentiments. No vice is more rare, for no task is more difficult, than systematic hypocrisy. When the Demagogue becomes a Usurper it does not follow that he was all the time a hypocrite.
Shallow men only so judge of others.
The truth is, that creed has, in general, very little influence on the conduct; in religion, on that of the individual; in politics, on that of party. As a general thing, the Mahometan, in the Orient, is far more
honest and trustworthy than the Christian. A Gospel of Love in the mouth, is an Avatar of Persecution in the heart. Men who believe in eternal damnation and a literal sea of fire and brimstone, incur the
certainty of it, according to their creed, on the slightest temptation of appetite or passion. Predestination insists on the necessity of good works. In Masonry, at the least flow of passion, one speaks ill of
another behind his back; and so far from the "Brotherhood" of Blue Masonry being real, and the solemn pledges contained in the use of the word "Brother" being complied with, extraordinary pains are
taken to show that. Masonry is a sort of abstraction, which scorns to interfere in worldly matters. The rule may be regarded as universal, that, where there is a choice to be made, a Mason will give his vote
and influence, in politics and business, to the less qualified profane in preference to the better qualified Mason. One will take an oath to oppose any unlawful usurpation of power, and then become the ready
and even eager instrument of a usurper. Another will call one "Brother" and then play toward him the part of Judas Iscariot, or strike him, as Joab did Abner, under the fifth rib, with a lie whose authorship
is not to be traced. Masonry does not change human nature, and cannot make honest men out of born knaves.
While you are still engaged in preparation, and in accumulating principles for future use, do not forget
the words of the Apostle James: "For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass, for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway
forgetteth what ma1lner of man he was; but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his work.
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being an abstraction. A man is justified
by works, and not by faith only. The devils believe, and tremble. As the body without the heart is dead, so is faith without works."

In political science, also, free governments are erected and free constitutions framed, upon some simple
and intelligible theory. Upon whatever theory they are based, no sound conclusion is to be reached except by carrying the theory out without flinching, both in argumcnt on constitutional qucstions and in
practice. Shrink from the true theory through timidity, or wander from it througll want of the logical faculty, or transgress against it througll passion or on the plea of necessity or expediency, and you have

abnegation and abdication of legitimate authority.
Do not forget, either, that as the showy, superficial, impudent and selfconceited will almost always be preferred, even in utmost stress of danger and calamity of the State, to the man of solid learning, large
intellect, and catholic sympathies, because he is nearer the common popular and legislative level, so the highest truth is not acceptable to the mass of mankind.
When SOLON was asked if he had given his countrymen the best laws, he answered, "The best they are
capable of receiving." This is one of the profoundest utterances on record; and yet like all great truths, so simple as to be rarely comprehended. It contains the whole philosophy of History. It utters a truth
which, had it been recognized, would have saved men an immensity of vain, idle disputes, and have led them into the clearer paths of knowledge in the Past. It means this, that all truths are Truths of Period,
and not truths for eternity; that whatever great fact has had strength and vitality enough to make itself real, whether of religion, morals, government, or of whatever else, and to find place in this world, has
been a truth for the time, and as good as men were capable of receiving.
So, too, with great men. The intellect and capacity of a people has a single measure, that of the great men whom Providence gives it, and whom it receives. There have always been men too great for their
time or their people. Every people makes such men only its idols, as it is capable of comprehending.
To impose ideal truth or law upon an incapable and merely real man, must ever be a vain and empty speculation. The laws of sympathy govern in this as they do in regard to men who are put at the head.
We do not know, as yet, what qualifications the sheep insist on in a leader. With men who are too high intellectually, the mass have as little sympathy as they have with the stars. When BURKE, the wisest
statesman England ever had, rose to speak, the House of Commons was depopulated as upon an agreed signal. There is as little sympathy between the mass and the highest TRUTHS. The highest truth, being
incomprehensible to the man of realities, as the highest man is, and largely above his level, will be a great unreality and falsehood to an unintellectual man. The profoundest doctrines of Christianity and
Philosophy would be mere jargon and babble to a Potawatomie Indian. The popular explanations of the symbols of Masonry are fitting for the multitude that have swarmed into the Temples, being fully up to
the level of their capacity. Catholicism was a vital truth in its earliest ages, but it became obsolete, and Protestantism arose, flourished, and deteriorated. The doctrines of ZOROASTER were the best which
the ancient Persians were fitted to receive; those of CONFUCIUS were fitted for the Chinese; those of MOHAMMED for the idolatrous Arabs of his age. Each was Truth for the time. Each was a GOSPEL,
preached by a REFORMER; and if any men are so little fortunate as to remain content therewith, when others have attained a higher truth, it is their misfortune and not their fault. They are to be pitied for it,
and not persecuted.

Do not expect easily to convince men of the truth, or to lead them to think aright. The subtle human intellect can weave its mists over even the clearest vision. Remember that it is eccentric enough to ask
unanimity from a jury; but to ask it from any large number of men on any point of political faith is amazing. You can hardly get two men in any Congress or Convention to agree;nay, you can rarely get
one to agree with himself.
The political church which chances to be supreme anywhere has an indefinite number of tongues. How then can we expect men to agree as to matters beyond the cognizance of the senses? How can we
compass the Infinitc and the Invisible with any chain of evidence? Ask the small seawaves what they murmur among the pebbles ! How many of those words that come from the invisible shore are lost, like
the birds, in the long passage ? How vainly do we strain the eyes across the long Infinite ! We must be content, as the children are, with the pebbles that have been stranded, since it is forbidden us to explore
the hidden depths.
The FellowCraft is especially taught by this not to become wise in his own conceit. Pride in unsound theories is worse than ignorancc. Humility becomes a Mason. Take some quiet, sober moment of life,
and add together the two ideas of Pride and Man; behold him, creature of a span, stalking through infinite space in all the grandeur of littleness! Perched on a speck of the Universe, every wind of
Heaven strikes into his blood the coldness of death; his soul floats avvay from his body like the melody from the string. Day and night, like dust on the wheel, he is rolled along the heavens, through a
labyrinth of worlds, and all the creations of God are flanling on every side, further than even his imagination can reach. Is this a creature to make for himself a crown of glory, to deny his own flesh, to
mock at his fellow, sprung with him from that dust to which both will soon return? Does the proud man not err? Does he not suffer? Does he not die? When he reasons, is he never stopped short by
difficulties? When he acts, does he never succumb to the temptations of pleasure? When he lives, is he free from pain? Do the diseases not claim him as their prey? When he dies, can he escape the common
grave? Pride is not the heritage of man. Humility should dwell with frailty, and atone for ignorance, error and imperfection.
Neither should the Mason be overanxious for office and honor, however certainly he may feel that he
has the capacity to serve the State. He should neither seek nor spurn honors. It is good to enjoy the blessings of fortune; it is better to submit without a pang to their loss. The greatest deeds are not done
in the glare of light, and before the eyes of the populace. He whom God has gifted with a love of retirement possesses, as it were, an additional sense; and among the vast and noble scenes of nature, w
e find the balm for the wounds we have received among the pitiful shifts of policy; for the attachment to solitude is the surest preservative from the ills of life.
But Resignation is the more noble in proportion as it is the less passive. Retirement is only a morbid
selfishness, if it prohibit exertions for others; as it is only dignified and noble, when it is the shade

whence the oracles issue that are to instruct mankind; and retirement of this nature is the sole seclusion which a good and wise man will covet or command. The very philosophy which makes such a man
covet the quiet, will make him eschew the inutility of the hermitage. Very little praiseworthy would LORD BOLINGBROKE have seemed among his haymakers and ploughmen, if among haymakers and
ploughmen he had looked with an indifferent eye upon a profligate minister and a venal Parliament. Very little interest would have attached to his beans and vetches, if beans and vetches had caused him to
forget that if he vvas happier on a fann he could be more useful in a Senate, and made him forego, in the sphere of a bailiff, all care for reentering that of a legislator.
Remember, also, that therc is an education which quickens the Intellect, and leaves the heart hollower
or harder than before. There are ethical lessons in the laws of the heavenly bodies, in the properties of earthly elements, in geography, chemistry, geology, and all the material sciences. Things are symbols
of Truths. Properties are symbols of Truths. Science, not teaching moral and spiritual truths, is dead and dry, of little more real value than to commit to the menlory a long row of unconnected dates, or of
the names of bugs or butterflies.
Christianity, it is said, begins from the burning of the false gods by the people themselves. Education begins with the burning of our intellectual and moral idols: our prejudices, notions, conceits, our
worthless or ignoble purposes. Especially it is necessary to shake off the love of worldly gain. With Freedom comes the longing for worldly advancement. In that race men are ever falling, rising, running,
and falling again. The lust for wealth and the abject dread of poverty delve the furrows on many a noble brow. The gambler grows old as he watches the chances. Lawful hazard drives Youth away before its
time; and this Youth draws heavy bills of exchange on Age. Men live, like the engines, at high pressure, a hundred years in a hundred months; the ledger becomes the Bible, and the daybook the Book of the
Morning Prayer.
Hence flow overreachings and sharp practice, heartless traffic in which the capitalist buys profit with the lives of the laborers, speculations that coin a nation's agonies into wealth, and all the other devilish
cnginery of Mammon. This, and greed for office, are the two columns at the entrance to the Temple of Moloch. It is doubtful whether the latter, blossoming in falsehood, trickery, and fraud, is not even more
pernicious than the former. At all events they are twins, and fitly mated; and as either gains control of the unfortunate subject, his soul withers away and decays, and at last dies out. The souls of half the
human race leave them long before they die. The two greeds are twin plagues of the leprosy, and make the man unclean; and whenever they break out they spread until "they cover all the skin of him that hath
the plague, from his head even to his foot." Even the raw flesh of the heart becomes unclean with it.
Alexander of Macedon has left a saying behind him which has survived his conquests: "Nothing is nobler than work." Work only can keep even kings respectable. And when a king is a king indeed, it is

conduct, and restore in spirit the old schools of chivalry, in which the young manhood may be nurtured to real greatness. Work and wages will go together in men's minds, in the most royal institutions. We
must ever come to the idea of real work. The rest that follows labor should be sweeter than the rest which follows rest.
Let no FellowCraft imagine that the work of the lowly and uninfluential is not worth the doing. There
is no legal limit to the possible influences of a good deed or a wise word or a generous effort. Nothing is really small. Whoever is open to the deep penetration of nature knows this. Although, indeed, no
absolute satisfaction may be vouchsafed to philosophy, any more in circumscribing the cause than in limiting the effect, the man of thought and contemplation falls into unfathomable ecstacies in view of
all the decompositions of forces resulting in unity. All works for all. Destruction is not annihilation, but regeneration.
Algebra applies to the clouds; the radiance of the star benefits the rose; no thinker would dare to say
that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the path of the molecule? How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by the fall of grains of
sand ? Who, then, understands the reciprocal flow and ebb of the inrlnitely great and the infinitely small; the echoing of causes in the abysses of beginning, and the avalanches of creation? A fleshworm
is of account; the small is great; the great is small; all is in equilibrium in necessity. There are marvellous relations between beings and things; in this inexhaustible Whole, from sun to grub, there is
no scorn: all need each other. Light does not carry terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it does with them; night distributes the stellar essence to the sleeping plants. Every bird
which flies has the thread of the Infinite in its claw. Germination includes the hatching of a meteor, and the tap of a swallow's bill, breaking the egg; and it leads forward the birth of an earthworm and the
advent of a Socrates. Where the telescope ends the microscope begins. Which of them the grander view? A bit of mould is a Pleiad of flowers a nebula is an anthill of stars.
There is the same and a still more wonderful interpenetration between the things of the intellect and the
things of matter. Elements and principles are mingled, combined, espoused, multiplied one by another to such a degree as to bring the material world and the moral world into the same light. Phenomena are
perpetually folded back upon themselves. In the vast cosmical changes the universal life comes and goes in unknown quantities, enveloping all in the invisible mystery of the emanations, losing no dream
from no single sleep, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling a star there, oscillating and winding in curves; making a force of Light, and an element of Thought; disseminated and indivisible, dissolving
all save that point without length, breadth, or thickness, The MYSELF; reducing everything to the Soul atom ; making everything blossom into God; entangling all activities, from the highest to the lowest, in
the obscurity of a dizzying mechanism; hanging the flight of an insect upon the movement of the earth; subordinating, perhaps, if only by the identity of the law, the eccentric evolutions of the comet in the
firmament, to the whirlings of the infusoria in the drop of water. A mechanism made of mind, the first motor of which is the gnat, and its last wheel the zodiac.

A peasantboy, guiding Blucher by the right one of two roads, the other being impassable for artillery,
enables him to reach Waterloo in time to save Wellington from a defeat that would have been a rout; and so enables the kings to imprison Napoleon on a barren rock in midocean. An unfaithful smith, by the
slovenly shoeing of a horse, causes his lameness, and, he stumbling, the career of his world conquering rider ends, and the destinies of empires are changed. A generous officer permits an imprisoned
monarch to end his game of chess before leading him to the block; and meanwhile the usurper dies, and the prisoner reascends the throne. An unskillful workman repairs the compass, or malice or stupidity
disarranges it, the ship mistakes her course, the waves swallow a Caesar, and a new chapter is written in the history of a world. What we call accident is but the adamantine chain of indissoluble connection
between all created things. The locust, hatched in the Arabian sands, the small worm that destroys the cottonboll, one making famine in the Orient, the other closing the mills and starving the vvorkmen and
their children in the Occident, with riots and massacres, are as much the ministers of God as the earthquake; and the fate of nations depends more on them than on the intellect of its kings and
legislators. A civil war in America will end in shaking the world; and that war may be caused by the vote of some ignorant prizefighter or crazed fanatic in a city or in a Congress, or of some stupid boor
in an obscure country parish. The electricity of universal sympathy, of action and reaction, pervades everything, the planets and the motes in the sunbeam. FAUST, with his types, or LUTHER, with his
sermons, worked greater results than Alexander or Hannibal. A single thought sometimes suffices to overturn a dynasty. A silly song did more to unseat James the Second than the acquittal of the Bishops.
Voltaire, Condorcet, and Rousseau uttered words that will ring, in change and revolutions, throughout all the ages.
Remember, that though life is short, Thought and the influences of what we do or say are immortal; and
that no calculus has yet pretended to ascertain the law of proportion between cause and effect. The hammer of an English blacksmith, smiting down an insolent official, led to a rebellion which came near
being a revolution. The word well spoken, the deed fitly done, even by the feeblest or humblest, cannot help but have their effect. More or less, the effect is inevitable and eternal. The echoes of the greatest
deeds may die away like the echoes of a cry among the cliffs, and what has been done seem to the human judgment to have been without result. The unconsidered act of the poorest of men may fire the
train that leads to the subterranean mine, and an empire be rent by the explosion.
The power of a free people is often at the disposal of a single and seemingly an unimportant individual; a terrible and truthful power; for such a people feel with one heart, and therefore can lift up their
myriad arms for a single blow. And, again, there is no graduated scale for the measurement of the influences of different intellects upon the popular mind. Peter the Hermit held no office, yet what a
work he wrought!

From the political point of view there is but a single principle, the sovereignty of man over himself.
This sovereignty of one's self over one's self is called LIBERTY. Where two or several of these sovereignties associate, the State begins. But in this association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty
parts with a certain portion of itself to form the common right. That portion is the same for all. There is equal contribution by all to the joint sovereignty. This identity of concession which each makes to all, is
EQUALITY. The common right is nothing more or less than the protection of all, pouring its rays on each. This protection of each by all, is FRATERNITY.
Liberty is the summit, Equality the base. Equality is not all vegetation on a level, a society of big spears
of grass and stunted oaks, a neighborhood of jealousies, emasculatillg each other. It is, civily, all aptitudes having equal opportunity; politically, all votes having equal weight; religiously, all
consciences having equal rights.
Equality has an organ;gratuitous and obligatory instruction. We must begin with the right to the alphabet. The primary school obligatory upon all; the higher school offered to all. Such is the law. From
the same school for all springs equal society. Instruction! Light! all comes from Light, and all returns to it.
We must learn the thoughts of the common people, if we would be wise and do any good work. We
must look at men, not so much for what Fortune has given to them with her blind old eyes, as for the gifts Nature has brought in her lap, and for the use that has been made of them. We profess to be equal
in a Church and in the Lodge: we shall be equal in the sight of God when He judges the earth. We may well sit on the pavement together here, in communion and conference, for the few brief moments that
constitute life.
A Democratic Government undoubtedly has its defects, because it is made and administered by men, and not by the Wise Gods. It cannot be concise and sharp, like the despotic. When its ire is aroused it
develops its latent strength, and the sturdiest rebel trembles. But its habitual domestic rule is tolerant, patient, and indecisive. Men are brought together, first to differ, and then to agree. Affirmation,
negation, discussion, solution: these are the means of attaining truth. Often the enemy will be at the gates before the babble of the disturbers is drowned in the chorus of consent. In the Legislative office
deliberation will often defeat decision. Liberty can play the fool like the Tyrants Refined society requires greater minuteness of regulation; and the steps of all advancing States are more and more to be
picked among the old rubbish and the new matcrials. The difficulty lies in discovering the right path through the chaos of confusion. The adjustment of mutual rights and wrongs is also more difficult in
democracies. We do not see and estimate the relative importance of objects so easily and clearly from the level or the waving iand as from the elevation of a lone peak, towering above the plain; for each
looks through his own mist.

Abject dependence on constituents, also, is too common. It is as miserable a thing as abject dependence
on a minister or the favorite of a Tyrant. It is rare to find a man who can speak out the simple truth that is in him, honestly and frankly, without fear, favor, or affection, either to Emperor or People.
Moreover, in assemblies of men, faith in each other is almost always wanting, unless a terrible pressure
of calamity or danger from without produces cohesion. Hence the constructive power of such assemblies is generally deficient. The chief triumphs of modern days, in Europe, have been in pulling
down and obliterating; not in building up. But Repeal is not Reform. Time must bring with him the Restorer and Rebuilder.
Speech, also, is grossly abused in Republics; and if the use of speech be glorious, its abuse is the most
villainous of vices. Rhetoric, Plato says, is the art of ruling the minds of men. But in democracies it is too common to hide thought in words,to overlay it, to babble nonsense. The gleams and glitter of
intellectual soapandwater bubbles are mistaken for the rainbowglories of genius. The worthless pyrites is continually mistaken for gold. Even intellect condescends to intellectual jugglery, balancing
thoughts as a juggler balances pipes on his chin. In all Congresses we have the inexhaustible flow of babble, and Faction's clamorous knavery in discussion, until the divine power of speech, that privilege
of man and great gift of God, is no better than the screech of parrots or the mimicry of monkeys. The mere talker, however fluent, is barren of deeds in the day of trial.
There are men voluble as women, and as well skilled in fencing with the tongue: prodigies of speech,
misers in deeds. Too much calking, like too much thinking, destroys the power of action. In human nature, the thought is only made perfect by deed. Silence is the mother of both. The trumpeter is not the
bravest of the brave. Steel and not brass wins the day. The great doer of great deeds is mostly slow and slovenly of speech. There are some men born and brcd to betray. Patriotism is their trade, and their
capital is speech. But no noble spirit can plead like Paul and be false to itself as Judas.
Imposture too commonly rules in republics; they seem to be ever in their minority; their guardians are selfappointed; and tlhe unjust thrive better than the just. The Despot, like the nightlion roaring,
drowns all the clamor of tongues at once, and speech, the birthright of the free man, becomes the bauble of the enslaved.
It is quite true that republics only occasionally, and as it were accidentally, select their wisest, or even
the less incapable among the incapables, to govern them and legislate for them. If genius, armed with learning and knowledge, will grasp the reins, the people will reverence it; if it only modestly offers
itself for office, it will be smitten on the face, even when, in the straits of distress and the agonies of calamity, it is indispensable to the salvation of the State. Put it upon the track with the showy and

superficial, the conceited, the ignorant, and impudent, the trickster and charlatan, and the result shall not be a moment doubtful. The verdicts of Legislatures and the People are like the verdicts of juries,
sometimes right by accident.
Offices, it is true, are showered, like the rains of Heaven, upon the just and the unjust. The Roman Augurs that used to laugh in each other's faces at the simplicity of the vulgar, were also tickled with
their own guile; but no Augur is needed to lead the people astray. They readily deceive themselves. Let a Republic begin as it may, it will not be out of its minority before imbecility will be promoted to high
places; and shallow pretence, getting itself puffed into notice, will invade all the sanctuaries. The most unscrupulous partisanship will prevail, even in respect to judicial trusts; and the most unjust
appointments constantly be made, although every improper promotion not merely confers one undeserved favor, but may make a hundred honest cheeks smart with injustice.
The country is stabbed in the front when those are brought into the stalled seats who should slink into
the dim gallery. Every stamp of Honor, illclutched, is stolen from the Treasury of Merit.
Yet the entrance into the public service, and the promotion in it, affect both the rights of individuals and those of the nation. Injustice in bestowing or withholding office ought to be so intolerable in
democratic communities that the least trace of it should be like the scent of Treason. It is not universally true that all citizens of equal character have an equal claim to knock at the door of every
public office and demand admittance. When any man presents himself for service he has a right to aspire to the highest body at once, if he can show his fitness for such a beginning, that he is fitter than
the rest who offer themselves for the same post. The entry into it can only justly be made through the door of merit. And whenever any one aspires to and attains such high post, especially if by unfair and
disreputable and indecent means, and is afterward found to be a signal failure, he should at once be beheaded. He is the worst among the public enemies.
When a man sumciently reveals himself, all others should be proud to give him due precedence. When
the power of promotion is abused in the grand passages of life whether by People, Legislature, or Executive, the unjust decision recoils on the judge at once. That is not only a gross, but a willful
shortness of sight, that cannot discover the deserving. If one will look hard, long, and honestly, he will not fail to discern merit, genius, and qualification; and the eyes and voice of the Press and Public should
condemn and denounce injustice wherever she rears her horrid head.
"The tools to the workmen!" no other principle will save a Republic from destruction, either by civil war or the dryrot. They tend to decay, do all we can to prevent it, like human bodies. If they try the
experiment of governing themselves by their smallest, they slide downward to the unavoidable abyss with tenfold velocity; and there never has been a Republic that has not followed that fatal course.

But however palpable and gross the inherent defects of democratic governments, and fatal as the results
finally and inevitably are, we need only glance at the reigns of Tiberius, Nero, and Caligula, of Heliogabalus and Caracalla, of Domitian and Commodus, to recognize that the difference between
freedom and despotism is as wide as that between Heaven and Hell.
The cruelty, baseness, and insanity of tyrants are incredible. Let him who complains of the fickle humors and inconstancy of a free people, read Pliny's character of Domitian. If the great man in a
Republic cannot win omce without descending to low arts and whining beggary and the judicious use of sneaking lies, let him remain in retirement, and use the pen. Tacitus and Juvenal held no office. Let
History and Satire punish the pretender as they crucify the despot. The revenges of the intellect are terrible and just.
Let Masonry use the pen and the printingpress in the free State against the Demagogue; in the
Despotism against the Tyrant. History offers examples and encouragement. All history, for four thousand years, being filled with violated rights and the sufferings of the people, each period of history
brings with it such protest as is possible to it. Under the Caesars there was no insurrection, but there was a Juvenal. The arousing of indignation replaces the Gracchi. Under the Caesars there is the exile of
Syene; there is also the author of the Annals. As the Neros reign darkly they should be pictured so. Work with the graver only would be pale; into the grooves should be poured a concentrated prose that
bites.
Despots are an aid to thinkers. Speech enchained is speech terrible. The writer doubles and triples his style, when silence is imposed by a master upon the people. There springs from this silence a certain
mysterious fullness, which filters and freezes into brass in the thoughts. Compression in the history produces conciseness in the historian. The granitic solidity of some celebrated prose is only a
condensation produced by the Tyrant. Tyranny constrains the writer to shortenings of diameter which are increases of strength. The Ciceronian period, hardly sumcient upon Verres, would lose its edge upon
Caligula.
The Demagogue is the predecessor of the Despot. One springs from the other's loins. He who will basely fawn on those who have office to bestow, will betray like Iscariot, and prove a miserable and
pitiable failure. Let the new Junius lash such men as they deserve, and History make them immortal in infamy; since their influences culminate in ruin. The Republic that employs and honors the shallow, the
superficial, the base, "who crouch Unto the offal of an office promised," at last weeps tears of blood for its fatal error. Of such supreme folly, the sure fruit is damnation. Let the nobility of every great heart,
condensed into justice and truth, strike such creatures like a thunderbolt ! If you can do no more, you can at least condemn by your vote, and ostracise by denunciation.

It is true that, as the Czars are absolute, they have it in their power to select the best for the public
service. It is true that the beginner of a dynasty generally does so; and that when monarchies are in their prime, pretence and shallowness do not thrive and prosper and get power, as they do in Republics. All
do not gabble in the Parliament of a Kingdom, as in the Congress of a Democracy. The incapables do not go undetected there, all their lives.
But dynasties speedily decay and run out. At last they dwindle down into imbecility; and the dull or
flippant Members of Congresses are at least the intellectual peers of the vast majority of kings. The great man, the Julius Caesar, the Charlemagne, Cromwell, Napoleon, reigns of right. He is the wisest
and the strongest. The incapables and imbeciles succeed and are usurpers; and fear makes them cruel. After Julius came Caracalla and Galba; after Charlemagne, the lunatic Charles the Sixth. So the
Saracenic dynasty dwindled out; the Capets, the Stuarts, the Bourbons; the last of these producing Bomba, the ape of Domitian.
Man is by nature cruel, like the tigers. The barbarian, and the tool of the tyrant, and the civilized
fanatic, enjoy the sufferings of others, as the children enjoy the contortions of maimed flies. Absolute Power, once in fear for the safety of its tenure, cannot but be cruel.
As to ability, dynasties invariably cease to possess any after a few lives. They become mere shams,
governed by ministers, favorites, or courtesans, like those old Etruscan kings, slumbering for long ages in their golden royal robes, dissolving forever at the first breath of day. Let him who complains of the
shortcomings of democracy ask himself if he would prefer a Du Barry or a Pompadour, governing in the name of a Louis the Fifteenth, a Caligula making his horse a consul, a Domitian, "that most savage
monster," who sometimes drank the blood of relatives, sometimes employing himself with slaughtering the most distinguished citizens before whose gates fear and terror kept watch; a tyrant of frightful
aspect, pride on his forehead, fire in his eye, constantly seeking darkness and secrecy, and only emerging from his solitude to make solitude. After all, in a free government, the Laws and the
Constitution are above the Incapables, the Courts correct their legislation, and posterity is the Grand Inquest that passes judgment on them. What is the exclusion of worth and intellect and knowledge from
civil office compared with trials before Jeffries, tortures in the dark caverns of the Inquisition, Alvabutcheries in the Netherlands, the Eve of Saint Bartholomew, and the Sicilian Vespers?

The Abbe Barruel in his Memoirs for the History of Jacobinism, declares that Masonry in France gave,
as its secret, the words Equality and Liberty, leaving it for every honest and religious Mason to explain them as would best suit his principles; but retained the privilege of unveiling in the higher Degrees the

meaning of those words, as interpreted by the French Revolution. And he also excepts English Masons from his anathemas, because in England a Mason is a peaceable subject of the civil authorities, no
matter where he resides, engaging in no plots or conspiracies against even the worst government. England, he says, disgusted with an Equality and a Liberty, the consequences of which she had felt in
the struggles of her Lollards, Anabaptists, and Presbyterians, had "purged her Masonry" from all explanations tending to overturn empires; but there still remained adepts whom disorganizing principles
bound to the Ancient Mysteries.
Because true Masonry, unemasculated, bore the banners of Freedom and Equal Rights, and was in rebellion against temporal and spiritual tyranny, its Lodges were proscribed in 1735, by an edict of the
States of Holland. In 1737, Louis XV. forbade them in France. In 1738, Pope Clement XII issued against them his famous Bull of Excommunication, which was renewed by Benedict XIV.; and in 1743 the
Council of Berne also proscribed them. The title of the Rull of Clement is, "The Condemnation of the Society of Conventicles de Liberi Muratori, or of the Freemasons, under the penalty of ipso facto
excommunication, the absolution from which is reserved to the Pope alone, except at the point of death." And by it all bishops, ordinaries, and inquisitors were empowered to punish Freemasons, "as
vehemently suspected of heresy," and to call in, if necessary, the help of the secular arm; that is, to cause the civil authority to put them to death.
******
Also, false and slavish political theories end in brutalizing the State. For example, adopt the theory that
offices and employments in it are to be given as rewards for services rendered to party, and they soon become the prey and spoil of faction, the booty of the victory of faction; and leprosy is in the flesh of
the State. The body of the commonwealth becomes a mass of corruption, like a living carcass rotten with syphilis. All unsound theories in the end develop themselves in one foul and loathsome disease or
other of the body politic. The State, like the man, must use constant effort to stay in the paths of virtue and manliness. The habit of electioneering and begging for office culminates in bribery with office, and
corruption in office.
A chosen man has a visible trust from God, as plainly as if the commission were engrossed by the notary. A nation cannot renounce the executorship of the Divine decrees. As little can Masonry. It must
labor to do its duty knowingly and wisely. We must remember that, in free States, as well as in despotisms, Injustice, the spouse of Oppression, is the fruitful parent of Deceit, Distrust, Hatred,
Conspiracy, Treason, and Unfaithfulness. Even in assailing Tyranny we must have Truth and Reason as our chief weapons. We must march into that fight like the old Puritans, or into the battle with the abuses
that spring up in free government, with the flaming sword in one hand, and the Oracles of God in the other.

The citizen who cannot accomplish well the smaller purposes of public life, cannot compass the larger. The vast power of endurance, forbearance, patience, and performance, of a free people, is acquired only
by continual exercise of all the functions, like the healthful physical human vigor. If the individual citizens have it not, the State must equally be without it. It is of the essence of a free government, that
the people should not only be concerned in making the laws, but also in their execution. No man ought to be more ready to obey and administer the law than he who has helped to make it. The business of
government is carried on for the benefit of all, and every copartner should give counsel and cooperation.
Remember also, as another shoal on which States are wrecked, that free States always tend toward the
depositing of the citizens in strata, the creation of castes, the perpetuation of the jus divinurn to office in families. The more democratic the State, the more sure this result. For, as free States advance in
power, there is a strong tendency toward centralization, not from deliberate evil intention, but from the course of events and the indolence of human nature. The executive powers swell and enlarge to
inordinate dimensions; and the Executive is always aggressive with respect to the nation. Offices of all kinds are multiplied to reward partisans; the brute force of the sewerage and lower strata of the mob
obtains large representation, first in the lower offices, and at last in Senates; and Bureaucracy raises its bald head, bristling with pens, girded with spectacles, and bunched with ribbon. The art of Government
becomes like a Craft, and its guilds tend to become exclusive, as those of the Middle Ages.
Political science may be much improved as a subject of speculation; but it should never be divorced from the actual national necessity. The science of governing men must always be practical, rather than
philosophical. There is not the same amount of positive or universal truth here as in the abstract sciences; what is true in one country may be very false in another; what is untrue today may become
true in another generation, and the truth of today be reversed by the judgment of tomorrow. To distinguish the casual from the enduring, to separate the unsuitable from the suitable, and to make
progress even possible, are the proper ends of policy. But without actual knowledge and experience, and communion of labor, the dreams of the political doctors may be no better than those of the doctors of
divinity. The reign of such a caste, with its mysteries, its myrmidons, and its corrupting influence, may be as fatal as that of the despots. Thirty tyrants are thirty times worse than one.
Moreover, there is a strong temptation for the governing people to become as much slothful and
sluggards as the weakest of absolute kings. Only give them the power to get rid, when caprice prompts them, of the great and wise men, and elect the little, and as to all the rest they will relapse into
indolence and indifference. The central power, creation of the people, organized and cunning if not enlightened, is the perpetual tribunal set up by them for the redress of wrong and the rule of justice. It
soon supplies itself with all the requisite machinery, and is ready and apt for all kinds of interference. The people may be a child all its life.

The central power may not be able to suggest the best scientific solution of a problem; but it has the easiest means of carrying an idea into effect. If the purpose to be attained is a large one, it requires a
large comprehension; it is proper for the action of the central power. If it be a small one, it may be thwarted by disagreement. The central power must step in as an arbitrator and prevent this. The people
may be too averse to change, too slothful in their own business, unjust to a minority or a majority. The central power must take the reins when the people drop them.
France became centralized in its government more by the apathy and ignorance of its people than by the
tyranny of its kings. When the inmost parishlife is given up to the direct guardianship of the State, and the repair of the belfry of a country church requires a written order from the central power, a people is
in its dotage. Men are thus nurtured in imbecility, from the dawn of social life. When the central government feeds part of the people it prepares all to be slaves. When it directs parish and county
affairs, they are slaves already. The next step is to regulate labor and its wages.
Nevertheless, whatever follies the free people may commit, even to the putting of the powers of legislation in the hands of the little competent and less honest, despair not of the final result. The
terrible teacher, EXPERIENCE, writing his lessons on hearts desolated with calamity and wrung by agony, will make thelll wiser in time. Pretence and grimace and sordid beggary for votes will some day
cease to avail. Have FAITH, and struggle on, against all evil influences and discouragements! FAITH is the Saviour and Redeemer of nations. When Christianity had grown weak, profitless, and powerless, the
Arab Restorer and Iconoclast came, like a cleansing hurricane. When the battle of Damascus was about to be fought, the Christian bishop, at the early dawn, in his robes, at the head of his clergy, with the
Cross once so triumphant raised in the air, came down to the gates of the city, and laid open before the army the Testament of Christ. The Christian general, THOMAS, laid his hand on the book, and said,
"Oh God! If our faith be true, aid us, and deliver us not into the hands of its enemies!" But KHALED, "the Sword of God," who had marched from victory to victory, exclaimed to his wearied soldiers, "Let
no man sleep! There will be rest enough in the bowers of Paradise; sweet will be the repose never more to be followed by labor." The faith of the Arab had become stronger than that of the Christian, and he
conquered.
The Sword is also, in the Bible, an emblem of SPEECH, or of the utterance of thought. Thus, in that vision or apocalypse of the sublime exile of Patmos, a protest in the name of the ideal, overwhelming
the real world, a tremendous satire uttered in the name of Religion and Liberty, and with its fiery reverberations smiting the throne of the Gesars, a sharp twoedged sword comes out of the mouth of the
Semblance of the Son of Man, encircled by the seven golden candlesticks, and holding in his right hand seven stars. "The Lord" says Isaiah, "hath made my mouth like a sharp sword." "I have slain them" says
Hosea, "by the words of my mouth". "The word of God" says the writer of the apostolic letter to the Hebrews, "is quick and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing
asunder of soul and spirit." "The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God" says Paul, writing to the Christians at Ephesus. "I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth" it is said in the

Apocalypse, to the angel of the church at Pergamos.
******
The spoken discourse may roll on strongly as the great tidal wave; but, like the wave, it dies at last feebly on the sands. It is heard by few, remembered by still fewer, and fades away, like an echo in the
mountains, leaving no token of power. It is nothing to the living and coming generations of men. It was the written hulllan speech, that gave power and permanence to human thought. It is this that makes the
whole human history but one individual life.
To write on the rock is to write on a solid parchment; but it requires a pilgrimage to see it. There is but one copy, and Time wears even that. To write on skins or papyrus was to give, as it were, but one tardy
edition, and the rich only could procure it. The Chinese stereotyped not only the unchanging wisdom of oid sages, but also the passing events. The process tended to suffocate thought, and to hinder progress;
for there is continual wandering in the wisest minds, and Truth writes her last words, not on clean tablets, but on the scrawl that Error has made and often mended.
Printing made the movable letters prolific. Thenceforth the orator spoke almost visibly to listening
nations; and the author wrote, like the Pope, his cecumenic decreesJ urbi et orbi, and ordered them to be posted up in all the marketplaces; remaining, if he chose, impervious to human sight. The doom of
tyrannies was thenceforth sealed. Satire and invective became potent as armies. The unseen hands of the Juniuses could launch the thunderbolts, and make the ministers tremble. One whisper from this
giant fills the earth as easily as Demosthenes filled the Agora. It will soon be heard at the antipodes as easily as in the next street. It travels with the lightning under the oceans. It makes the mass one man,
speaks to it in the same comtnon language, and elicits a sure and single response. Speech passes into thought, and thence promptly into act. A nation becomes truly one, with one large heart and a single
throbbing pulse. Men are invisibly present to each other, as if already spiritual beings; and the thinker who sits in an Alpine solitude, unknown to or forgotten by all the world, among the silent herds and
hills, may flash his words to all the cities and over all the seas.
Select the thinkers to be Legislators; and avoid the gabblers. Wisdom is rarely loquacious. Weight and depth of thougbt are unfavorable to volubility. The shallow and superficial are generally voluble and
often pass for eloquent. More words, less thought, is the general rule. The man who endeavors to say something worth remembering in every sentence, becomes fastidious, and condenses like Tacitus. The
vulgar love a more diffuse stream. The ornamentation that does not cover strength is the gewgaws of babble.
Neither is dialectic subtlety valuable to public men. The Christian faith has it, had it formerly more than

now; a subtlety that might have entangled Plato, and which has rivalled in a fruitless fashion the mystic lore of Jewish Rabbis and Indian Sages. It is not this which converts the heathen. It is a vain task to
balance the great thoughts of the earth, like hollow straws, on the fingertips of disputation. It is not this kind of warfare which makes the Cross triumphant in the hearts of the unbelievers; but the actual power
that lives in the Faith.
So there is a political scholasticism that is merely useless. The dexterities of subtle logic rarely stir the hearts of the people, or convince them. The true apostle of Liberty, Fraternity and Equality makes it a
matter of life and death. His combats are like those of Bossuet, combats to the death. The true apostolic fire is like the lightning: it flashes conviction into the soul. The true word is verily a twoedged sword.
Matters of government and political science can be fairly dealt with only by sound reason, and the logic of common sense: not the common sense of the ignorant, but of the wise. The acutest thinkers rarely
succeed in becoming leaders of men. A watchword or a catchword is more potent with the people than logic, especially if this be the least metaphysical. When a political prophet arises, to stir the dreaming,
stagnant nation, and hold back its feet from the irretrievable descent, to heave the land as with an earthquake, and shake the sillyshallow idols from their seats, his words vvill come straight from God's
own mouth, and be thundered into the conscience. He will reason, teach, warn, and rule. The real "Sword of the Spirit" is keener than the brightest blade of Damascus. Such men rule a land, in the
strength of justice, with wisdom and with power. Still, the men of dialectic subtlety often rule well, because in practice they forget their finelyspun theories, and use the trenchant logic of common sense.
But when the great heart and large intellect are left to the rust in private life, and small attorneys, brawlers in politics, and those who in the cities would be only the clerks of notaries, or practitioners in
the disreputable courts, are made national Legislators, the country is in her dotage. even if the beard has not yet grown upon her chin.
In a free country, human speech must needs be free; and the State must listen to the maunderings of
folly, and the screechings of its geese, and the brayings of its asses, as well as to the golden oracles of its wise and great men. Even the despotic old kings allowed their wise fools to say what they liked. The
true alchelllist will extract the lessons of wisdom from the babblings of folly. He will hear what a man has to say on any given subject, even if the speaker end only in proving himself prince of fools. Even a
fool will sometimes hit the mark. There is some truth in all men who are not compelled to suppress their souls and speak other men's thoughts. The finger even of the idiot may point to the great highway.
A people, as well as the sages, must learn to forget. If it neither learns the new nor forgets the old, it is
fated, even if it has been royal for thirty generations. To unlearn is to learn; and also it is sometimes needful to learn again the forgotten. The antics of fools make the current follies more palpable, as
fashions are shown to be absurd by caricatures, which so lead to their extirpation. The buffoon and the zany are useful in their places. The ingenious artificer and craftsman, like Solomon, searches the earth
for his materials, and transforms the misshapen matter into glorious workmanship. The world is conquered by the head even more than by the hands. Nor will any assembly talk forever. After a time,

when it has listened long enough, it quietly puts the silly, the shallow, and the superficial to one side, it thinks, and sets to work. The human thought, especially in popular assemblies, runs in the most
singularly crooked channels, harder to trace and follow than the blind currents of the ocean. No notion is so absurd that it may not find a place there. The masterworkman must train these notions and
vagaries with his twohanded hammer. They twist out of the way of the swordthrusts; and are invulnerable all over, even in the heel, against logic. The martel or mace, the battleaxe, the great
doubleedged twohanded sword must deal with follies; the rapier is no better against them than a wand, unless it be the rapier of ridicule.
The SWORD is also the symbol of war and of the soldier. Wars, like thunderstorms, are often
necessary to purify the stagnant atmosphere. War is not a demon, without remorse or reward. It restores the brotherhood in letters of fire. When men are seated in their pleasant places, sunken in ease and
indolence, with Pretence and Incapacity and Littleness usurping all the high places of State, war is the baptism of blood and fire, by which alone they can be renovated. It is the hurricane that brings the
elemental equilibrium, the concord of Power and Wisdom. So long as these continue obstinately divorced, it will continue to chasten.
In the mutual appeal of nations to God, there is the acknowledgment of His might. It lights the beacons
of Faith and Freedom, and heats the furnace through which the earnest and loyal pass to immortal glory. There is in war the doom of defeat, the quenchless sense of Duty, the stirring sense of Honor, the
measureless solemn sacrifice of devotedness, and the incense of success. Even in the flame and smoke of battle, the Mason discovers his brother, and fulfills the sacred obligations of Fraternity.
Two, or the Duad, is the symbol of Antagonism; of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness. It is Cain and
Abel, Eve and Lilith, Jachin and Boaz, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Osiris and Typhon.
THREE, or the Triad, is most significantly expressed by the equilateral and the rightangled triangles. There are three principal colors or rays in the rainbow, which by intermixture make seven. The three are
the blue, the yelloW, and the red. The Trinity of the Deity, in one mode or other, has been an article in all creeds. He creates, preserves, and destroys. He is the generative power, the productive capacity, and
the result. The immaterial man, according to the Kabalah, is composed of vitality, or life, the breath of life; of soul or mind, and spirit. Salt, sulphur, and mercury are the great symbols of the alchemists. To
them man was body, soul, and spirit.
FOUR is expressed by the square, or foursided rightangled figure. Out of the symbolic Garden of Eden flowed a river, dividing into four streams, PISON, which flows around the land of gold, or light;
GIHON, which flows around the land of Ethiopia or Darkness; HIDDEKEL, running eastward to Assyria; and the EUPHRATES. Zechariah saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains

of bronze, in the first of which were red horses; in the second, black; in the third, white; and in the fourth, grizzled: "and these were the four winds of the heavens, that go forth from standing before the
Lord of all the earth." Ezekiel saw the four living creatures, each with four faces and four wings, the faces of a man and a lion, an ox and an eagle; and the four wheels going upon their four sides; and Saint
John beheld the four beasts, full of eyes before and behind, the LION, the young Ox, the MAN, and the flying EAGLE. Four was the signature of the Earth. Therefore, in the 148th Psalm, of those who must
praise the Lord on the land, there are four times four, and four in particular of living creatures. Visible nature is described as the four quarters of the world, and the four corners of the earth. "There are four"
says the old Jewish saying, "which take the first place in this world: man, among the creatures; the eagle among birds; the ox among cattle; and the lion among wild beasts." Daniel saw four great beasts
come up from the sea.
FIVE is the Duad added to the Triad. It is expressed by the fivepointed or blazing star, the mysterious Pentalpha of Pythagoras. It is indissolubly connected with the number seven. Christ fed His disciples
and the multitude with five loaves and two fishes, and of the fragments there remained twelve, that is, five and seven, baskets full. Again He fed them with seven loaves and a few little fishes, and there
remained seven baskets full. The five apparently small planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, with the two greater ones, the Sun and Moon, constituted the seven celestial spheres.
SEVEN was the peculiarly sacred number. There were seven planets and spheres presided over by seven
archangels. There were seven colors in the rainbow; and the Phoenician Deity was called the HEPTAKIS or God of seven rays; seven days of the week; and seven and five made the number of
months, tribes, ancl apostles. Zechariah saw a golden candlestick, with seven lamps and seven pipes to the lamps, and an olivetree on each side. Since he says, "the seven eyes of the Lord shall rejoice, and
shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel." John, in the Apocalypse, writes seven epistles to the seven churches. In the seven epistles there are twelve promises. What is said of the churches in praise or
blame, is completed in the number three. The refrain, "who has ears to hear," etc., has ten words, divided by three and seven, and the seven by three and four; and the seven epistles are also so divided.
In the seals, trumpets, and vials, also, of this symbolic vision, the seven are divided by four and three. He who sends his message to Ephesus, "holds the seven stars in his right hand, and walks amid the
seven golden lamps."
In six days, or periods, God created the Universe, and paused on the seventh day. Of clean beasts, Noah was directed to take by sevens into the ark; and of fowls by sevens; because in seven days the rain was
to commence. On the seventeenth day of the month. the rain began; on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark rested on Ararat. When the dove returned, Noah waited seven days before he
sent her forth again; and again seven, after she returned with the oliveleaf. Enoch was the seventh patriarch, Adam included, and Lamech lived 777 years.

There were seven lamps in the great candlestick of the Tabernacle and Temple, representing the seven planets. Seven times Moses sprinkled the anointing oil upon the altar. The days of consecration of
Aaron and his sons were seven in number. A woman was unclean seven days after childbirth; one infected with leprosy was shut up seven days; seven times the leper was sprinkled with the blood of a
slain bird; and seven days afterwards he must remain abroad out of his tent. Seven times, in purifying the leper, the priest was to sprinkle the consecrated oil; and seven times to sprinkle with the blood of
the sacrificed bird the house to be purified. Seven times the blood of the slain bullock was sprinkled on the mercyseat; and seven times on the altar. The seventh year was a Sabbath of rest; and at the end of
seven times seven years came the great year of jubilee. Seven days the people ate unleavened bread, in the month of Abib. Seven weeks were counted from the time of first putting the sickle to the wheat. The
Feast of the Tabernacles lasted seven days.
Israel was in the hand of Midian seven years before Gideon delivered them. The bullock sacrificed by him was seven years old. Samson told Delilah to bind him with seven green withes; and she wove the
seven locks of his head, and afterwards shaved them off. Balaam told Barak to build for him seven altars. Jacob served seven years for Leah and seven for Rachel. Job had seven sons and three daughters,
making the perfect number ten. He had also seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels. His friends sat down with him seven days and seven nights. His friends were ordered to sacrifice seven
bullocks and seven rams; and again, at the end, he had seven sons and three daughters, and twice seven thousand sheep, and lived an hundred and forty, or twice seven times ten years. Pharaoh saw in his
dream seven fat and seven lean kine, seven good ears and seven blasted ears of wheat; and there were seven years of plenty, and seven of famine. Jericho fell, when seven priests, with seven trumpets, made
the circuit of the city on seven successive days; once each day for six days, and seven times on the seventh. "The seven eyes of the Lord" says Zechariah, "run to and fro through the whole earth."
Solomon was seven years in building the Temple. Seven angels, in the Apocalypse, pour out seven plagues, from seven vials of wrath. The scarletcolored beast, on which the woman sits in the
wilderness, has seven heads and ten horns. So also has the beast that rises Up out of the sea. Seven thunders uttered their voices. Seven angels sounded seven trumpets. Seven lamps of fire, the seven
spirits of God, burned before the throne; and the Lamb that was slain had seven horns and seven eyes.
EIGHT is the first cube, that of two. NINE is the square of three, and represented by the triple triangle.
TEN includes all the other numbers. It is especially seven and three; and is called the number of perfection. Pythagoras represented it by the TETRACTYS, which had many mystic meanings. This
symbol is sometimes composed of dots or points, sometimes of commas or yods, and in the Kabalah, of the letters of the name of Deity. It is thus arranged:

To understand literally the symbols and allegories of Oriental books as to antehistorical matters, is willfully to close our eyes against the Light. To translate the symbols into the trivial and commonplace,
is the blundering of mediocrity.
All religious expression is symbolism; since we can describe only what we see, and the true objects of religion are THE SEEN. The earliest instruments of education were symbols; and they and all other
religious forms differed and still differ according to external circumstances and imagery, and according to differences of knowledge and mental cultivation. All language is symbolic, so far as it is applied to

55/641
mental and spiritual phenomena and action. All words have, primarily, a material sense, however they may afterward get, for the ignorant, a spiritual nonsense. "To retract," for example, is to draw back, and
when applied to a statement, is symbolic, as much so as a picture of an arm drawn back, to express the same thing, would be. The very word "spirit" means "breath," from the Latin verb spiro, breathe.
To present a visible symbol to the eye of another is not necessarily to inform him of the meaning which
that symbol has to you. Hence the philosopher soon superadded to the symbols explanations addressed to the ear, susceptible of more precision, but less effective and impressive than the painted or sculptured
forms which he endeavored to explain. Out of these explanations grew by degrees a variety of narrations, whose true object and meaning were gradually forgotten, or lost in contradictions and
incongruities. And when these were abandoned, and Philosophy resorted to definitions and formulas, its language was but a more complicated symbolism, attempting in the dark to grapple with and picture
ideas impossible to be expressed. For as with the visible symbol, so with the word: to utter it to you does not inform you of the exact meaning which it has to me; and thus religion and philosophy became
to a great extent disputes as to the meaning of words. The most abstract expression for DEITY, which language can supply, is but a sign or symbol for an object beyond our comprehension, and not more
truthful and adequate than the images of OSIRIS and VISHNU, or their names, except as being less sensuous and explicit. We avoid sensuousness only by resorting to simple negation. We come at last to
define spirit by saying that it is not matter. Spirit is spirit.
A single example of the symbolism of words will indicate to you one branch of Masonic study. We find in the English Rite this phrase: "I will always hail, ever conceal, and never reveal;" and in the
Catechism, these: Q.'. "I hail." A.'. "I conceal," and ignorance, misunderstanding the word "hail," has interpolated the phrase, "From whence do you hail."
But the word is really "hele," from the AngloSaxon verb elan, helan, to cover, hide, or conceal. And
this word is rendered by the Latin verb tegere, to cover or roof over. "That ye fro me no thynge woll hele," says Gower. "They hele fro me no priuyte," says the Romaunt of the Rose. "To heal a house," is a
common phrase in Sussex; and in the west of England, he that covers a house with slates is called a Healer. Wherefore, to "heal" means the same thing as to "tile,"itself symbolic, as meaning, primarily,
to cover a house with tiles, and means to cover, hide, or conceal. Thus language too is symbolism, and words are as much misunderstood and misused as more material symbols are.
Symbolism tended continually to become more complicated; and all the powers of Heaven were
reproduced on earth, until a web of fiction and allegory was woven, partly by art and partly by the ignorance of error, which the wit of man, with his limited means of explanation, will never unravel.
Even the Hebrew Theism became involved in symbolism and imageworship, borrowed probably from an older creed and remote regions of Asia, the worship of the Great Semitic NatureGod AL or ELS
and its symbolical representations of JEHOVA Himself were not even confined to poetical or

illustrative language. The priests were monotheists: the people idolaters.
There are dangers inseparable from symbolism, which afford an impressive lesson in regard to the similar risks attendant on the use of language. The imagination, called in to assist the reason, usurps its
place or leaves its ally helplessly entangled in itsweb. Names which stand for things are confounded with them; the means are mistaken for the end; the instrument of interpretation for the object; and thus
symbols come to usurp an independent character as truths and persons. Though perhaps a necessary path, they were a dangerous one by which to approach the Deity; in which many, says PLUTARCH,
"mistaking the sign for the thing signified, fell into a ridiculous superstition; while others, in avoiding one extreme, plunged into the no less hideous gulf of irreligion and impiety."
It is through the Mysteries, CICERO says, that we have learned the first principles of life; wherefore the
term "initiation" is used with good reason; and they not only teach us to live more happily and agrceably, but they soften the pains of death by the hope of a better life hereafter.
The Mysteries were a Sacred Drama, exhibiting some legend significant of nature's changes, of the
visible Universe in which the Divinity is revealed, and whose import was in many respects as open to the Pagan as to the Christian. Nature is thc great Teacher of man; for it is the Revelation of God. It
neither dogmatizes nor attempts to tyrannize by compelling to a particular creed or special interpretation. It presents its symbols to us, and adds nothing by way of explanation. It is the text
without the commentary; and, as we well know, it is chiefly the commentary and gloss that lead to error and heresesy and persecution. The earliest instructors of mankind not only adopted the lessons of
Nature, but as far as possible adhered to her method of imparting them. In the Mysteries, beyond the current traditions or sacred and enigimatic recitals of the Temples, few explanations were given to the
spectators, who were left, as in the school of nature, to make inferences for themselves. No other method could have suited every degree of cultivation and capacity. To employ nature's universal
symbolism instead of the technicalities of language, rewards the humblest inquirer, and discloses its secrets to every one in proportion to his preparatory training and his power to con1prellend them. If
their philosophical meaning was above the comlirellension of some, their moral and political meanlngs are within the reach of all.
These mystic shows and performances were not the reading of a lecture, but the opening of a problem.
Requiring research, they were calculated to arouse the dormant intellect. They implied no hostility to Philosophy, because Philosophy is the great expounder of symbolism; although its ancient
interpretations were often illfounded and incorrect. The alteration from symbol to dogma is fatal to beauty of expression, and leads to intolerance and assumed infallibility.

If, in teaching the great doctrine of the divine nature of the Soul, and in striving to explain its longings
after immortality, and in proving its superiority over the souls of the animals, which have no aspirations Heavenward, the ancients struggled in vain to express the nature of the soul, by comparing it to FIRE
and LIGHT, it will be well for us to consider whether, with all our boasted knowledge, we have any better or clearer idea of its nature, and whether we have not despairingly taken refuge in having none at
all. And if they erred as to its original place of abode, and understood literally the mode and path of its descent, these were but the accessories of the great Truth, and probably, to the Initiates, mere allegories,
designed to make the idea more palpable and impressive to the mind.
They are at least no more fit to be smiled at by the selfconceit of a vain ignorance, the wealth of whose knowledge consists solely in words, than the bosom of Abraham, as a home for the spirits of the just
dead; the gulf of actual fire, for the eternal torture of spirits; and the City of the New Jerusalem, with its walls of jasper and its edifices of pure gold like clear glass, its foundations of precious stones, and its
gates each of a single pearl. "I knew a man," says PAUL, "caught up to the third Heaven; that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard ineffable words, which it is not possible for a man to utter." And
nowhere is the antagonism and conflict between the spirit and body more frequently and forcibly insisted on than in the writings of this apostle, nowhere the Divine nature of the soul more strongly
asserted. "With the mind," he says, "I serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the sons of GOD. The earnest expectation of the created waits for
the manifestation of the sons of God. The created shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, of the flesh liable to decay, into the glorious liberty of the children of God."

Two forms of government are favorable to the prevalence of falsehood and deceit. Under a Despotism,
men are false, treacherous, and deceitful through fear, like slaves dreading the lash. Under a Democracy they are so as a means of attaining popularity and office, and because of the greed for wealth.
Experience will probably prove that these odious and detestable vices will grow most rankly and spread most rapidly in a Republic. When office and wealth become the gods of a people, and the most
unworthy and unfit most aspire to the former, and fraud becomes the highway to the latter, the land will reek with falsehood and sweat lies and chicane. When the offices are open to all, merit and stern
integrity and the dignity of unsullied honor will attain them only rarely and by accident. To be able to serve the country well, will cease to be a reason why the great and wise and learned should be selected
to render service. Other qualifications, less honorable, will be more available. To adapt one's opinions to the popular humor; to defend, apologize for, and justify the popular follies; to advocate the expedient
and the plausible; to caress, cajole, and flatter the elector; to beg like a spaniel for his vote, even if he be a negro three removes from barbarism; to profess friendship for a competitor and stab him by innuendo;
to set on foot that which at third hand shall become a lie, being cousingerman to it when uttered, and yet capable of being explained away, who is there that has not seen these low arts and base appliances

put into practice, and becoming general, until success cannot be surely had by any more honorable means? The result being a State ruled and ruined by ignorant and shallow mediocrity, pert selfconceit,
the greenness of unripe intellect, vain of a schoolboy's smattering of knowledge.
The faithless and the false in public and in political life, will be faithless and false in private. The jockey in politics, like the jockey on the racecourse, is rotten from skin to core. Everywhere he will see
first to his own interests, and whoso leans on him will be pierced with a broken reed. His ambition is ignoble, like himself; and therefore he will seek to attain omce by ignoble means, as he will seek to
attain any other coveted object, land, money, or reputation.
At length, office and honor are divorced. The place that the small and shallow, the knave or the trickster, is deemed competent and fit to fill, ceases to be worthy the ambition of the great and capable;
or if not, these shrink from a contest, the weapons to be used wherein are unfit for a gentleman to handle. Then the habits of unprincipled advocates in law courts are naturalized in Senates, and
pettifoggers wrangle there, when the fate of the nation and the lives of millions are at stake. States are even begotten by villainy and brought forth by fraud, and rascalities are justified by legislators claiming
to be honorable. Then contested elections are decided by perjured votes or party considerations; and all the practices of the worst times of corruption are revived and exaggerated in Republics.
It is strange that reverence for truth, that manliness and genuine loyalty, and scorn of littleness and
unfair advantage, and genuine faith and godliness and largeheartedness should diminish, among statesmen and people, as civilization advances, and freedom becomes more general, and universal
suffrage implies universal worth and fitness! In the age of Elizabeth, without universal suffrage, or Societies for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, or popular lecturers, or Lycaea, the statesman, the
merchant, the burgher, the sailor, were all alike heroic, fearing God only, and man not at all. Let but a hundred or two years elapse, and in a Monarchy or Republic of the same race, nothing is less heroic
than the merchant, the shrewd speculator, the officeseeker, fearing man only, and God not at all. Reverence for greatness dies out, and is succeeded by base envy of greatness. Every man is in the way
of many, either in the path to popularity or wealth. There is a general feeling of satisfaction when a great statesman is displaced, or a general, who has been for his brief hour the popular idol, is
unfortunate and sinks from his high estate. It becomes a misfortune, if not a crime, to be above the popular level.
We should naturally suppose that a nation in distress would take counsel with the wisest of its sons.
But, on the contrary, great men seem never so scarce as when they are most needed, and small men never so bold to insist on infesting place, as when mediocrity and incapable pretence and sophomoric
greenness, and showy and sprightly incompetency are most dangerous. When France was in the extremity of revolutionary agony, she was governed by an assembly of provincial pettifoggers, and

governed by the Rump Parliament, after she had beheaded her king. Cromwell extinguished one body, and Napoleon the other.
Fraud, falsehood, trickery, and deceit in national affairs are the signs of decadence in States and
precede convulsions or paralysis. To bully the weak and crouch to the strong, is the policy of nations governed by small mediocrity. The tricks of the canvass for office are reenacted in Senates. The
Executive becomes the dispenser of patronage, chiefly to the most unworthy; and men are bribed with offices instead of money, to the greater ruin of the Commonwealth. The Divine in human nature
disappears, and interest, grced, and selfishness takes it place. That is a sad and true allegory which represents the companions of Ulysses changed by the enchantments of Circe into swine.

"Ye cannot," said the Great Teacher, "serve God and Mammon." When the thirst for wealth becomes
general, it will be sought for as well dishonestly as honestly; by frauds and overreachings, by the knaveries of trade, the heartlessness of greedy speculation, by gambling in stocks and commodities that
soon demoralizes a whole community. Men will speculate upon the needs of their neighbors and the distresses of their country. Bubbles that, bursting, impoverish multitudes, will be blown up by cunning
knavery, with stupid credulity as its assistants and instrument. Huge bankruptcies, that startle a country like the earthquakes, and are more fatal, fraudulent assignments, engulfment of the savings of the poor,
expansions and collapses of the currency, the crash of banks, the depreciation of Government securities, prey on the savings of selfdenial, and trouble with their depredations the first nourishment of infancy
and the last sands of life, and fill with inmates the churchyards and lunatic asylums. But the sharper and speculator thrives and fattens. If his country is fighting by a levy en masse for her very existence, he
aids her by depreciating her paper, so that he may accumulate fabulous amounts with little outlay. If his neighbor is distressed, he buys his property for a song. If he administers upon an estate, it turns out
insolvent, and the orphans are paupers. If his bank explodes, he is found to have taken care of himself in time. Society worships its paperandcredit kings, as the old Hindus and Egyptians worshipped their
worthless idols, and often the most obsequiously when in actual solid wealth they are the veriest paupers. No wonder men think there ought to be another world, in which the injustices of this may be
atoned for, when they see the friends of ruined families begging the wealthy sharpers to give alms to prevent the orphaned victims from starving, until they may findways of supporting themselves.

States are chiefly avaricious of commerce and of territory. The latter leads to the violation of treaties,
encroachments upon feeble neighbors, and rapacity toward their wards whose lands are coveted. Republics are, in this, as rapacious and unprincipled as Despots, never learning from history that

inordinate expansion by rapine and fraud has its inevitable consequences in dismen1berment or subjugation. When a Republic begins to plunder its neighbors, the words of doom are already written
on its walls. There is a judgment already pronounced of God upon whatever is unrighteous in the conduct of national affairs. When civil war tears the vitals of a Republic, let it look back and see if it
has not been guilty of injustices; and if it has, let it humble itself in the dust!
When a nation becomes possessed with a spirit of commercial greed, beyond those just and fair limits set by a due regard to a moderate and reasonable degree of general and individual prosperity, it is a
nation possessed by the devil of commercial avarice, a passion as ignoble and demoralizing as avarice in the individual; and as this sordid passion is baser and more unscrupulous than ambition, so it is more
hateful, and at last makes the infected nation to be regarded as the enemy of the human race. To grasp at the lion's share of commerce, has always at last proven the ruin of States, because it invariably leads to
iojustices that make a State detestable; to a selfishness and crooked policy that forbid other nations to be the friends of a State that cares only for itself.
Commercial avarice in India was the parent of more atrocities and greater rapacity, and cost more
human lives, than the nobler ambition for extended empire of Consular Rome. The nation that grasps at the commerce of the world cannot but become selfish, calculating, dead to the noblest impulses and
sympathies which ought to actuate States. It will submit to insults that wound its honor, rather than endanger its commercial interests by war; while, to subserve those interests, it will wage unjust war, on
false or frivolous pretexts, its free people cheerfully allying themselves with despots to crush a commercial rival that has dared to exile its kings and elect its own ruler.
Thus the cold calculations of a sordid selfinterest, in nations commercially avaricious, always at last
displace the sentiments and lofty impulses of Honor and Generosity by which they rose to greatness; which made Elizabeth and Cromwell alike the protectors of Protestants beyond the four seas of
England, against crowned Tyranny and mitred Persecution; and, if they had lasted, would have forbidden alliances with Czars and Autocrats and Bourbons to reenthrone the Tyrannies of Incapacity,
and arm the Inquisition anew with its instruments of torture. The soul of the avaricious nation petrifies, like the soul of the individual who makes gold his god. The Despot will occasionally act upon noble
and generous impulses, and help the weak against the strong, the right against the wrong. But commercial avarice is essentially egotistic, grasping, faithless, overreaching, crafty, cold, ungenerous,
selfish, and calculating, controlled by considerations of selfinterest alone. Heartless and merciless, it has no sentiments of pity, sympathy, or honor, to make it pause in its remorseless career; and it crushes
down all that is of impediment in its way, as its keels of commerce crush under them the murmuring and unheeded waves.
A war for a great principle ennobles a nation. A war for commercial supremacy, upon some shallow
pretext, is despicable, and more than aught else demonstrates to what immeasurable depths of baseness

men and nations can descend. Commercial greed values the lives of men no more than it values the lives of ants. The slavetrade is as acceptable to a people enthralled by that greed, as the trade in ivory
or spices, if the profits are as large. It will byandby endeavor to compound with God and quiet its own conscience, by compelling those to whom it sold the slaves it bought or stole, to set them free, and
slaughtering them by hecatombs if they refuse to obey the edicts of its philanthropy.
Justice in no wise consists in meting out to another that exact measure of reward or punishment which we think and decree his merit, or what we call his crime, which is more often merely his error,
deserves. The justice of the father is not incompatible with forgiveness by him of the errors and offences of his child. The Infinite Justice of God does not consist in meting out exact measures of
punishment for human frailties and sins. We are too apt to erect our own little and narrow notions of what is right and just into the law of justice, and to insist that God shall adopt that as His law; to
measure off something with our own little tapeline, and call it God's love of justice. Continually we seek to ennoble our own ignoble love of revenge and retaliationJ by misnaming it justice.
Nor does justice consist in strictly governing our conduct toward other men by the rigid rules of legal
right. If there were a community anywhere, in which all stood upon the strictness of this rule, there should be written over its gates, as a warning to the unfortunates desiring admission to that inhospitable
realm, the words which DANTE says are written over the great gate of Hell: LET THOSE WHO ENTER HERE LEAVE HOPE BEHIND ! It is not just to pay the laborer in field or factory or
workshop his current wages and no more, the lowest marketvalue of his labor, for so long only as we need that labor and he is able to work; for when sickness or old age overtakes him, that is to leave him
and his family to starve; and God will curse with calamity the people in which the children of the laborer out of work eat the boiled grass of the field, and mothers strangle their children, that they may
buy food for themselves with the charitable pittance given for burial expenses. The rules of what is ordinarily termed "Justice," may be punctiliously observed among the fallen spirits that are the
aristocracy of Hell.
******
Justice, divorced from sympathy, is selfish indifference, not in the least more laudable than misanthropic isolation. There is sympathy even among the hairlike oscillatorias, a tribe of simple
plants, armies of which may be discovered with the aid of the microscope, in the tiniest bit of scum from a stagnant pool. For these will place themselves, as if it were by agreement, in separate
companies, on the side of a vessel containing them, and seem marching upward in rows; and when a swarm grows weary of its situation, and has a mind to change its quarters, each army holds on its way
without confusion or intermixture, proceeding with great regularity and order, as if under the directions of wise leaders. The ants and bees give each other mutual assistance, beyond what is required by that
which human creatures are apt to regard as the strict law of justice.

Surely we need but reflect a little, to be convinced that the individual man is but a fraction of the unit of
society, and that he is indissolubly connected with the rest of his race. Not only the actions, but the will and thoughts of other men make or mar his fortunes, control his destinies, are unto him life or death,
dishonor or honor. The epidemics, physical and moral, contagious and infectious, public opinion, popular delusions, enthusiasms, and the other great electric phenomena and currents, moral and
intellectual, prove the universal sympathy. The vote of a single and obscure n1an, the utterance of self will, ignorance, conceit, or spite, deciding an election and placing Folly or Incapacity or Baseness in a
Senate, involves the country in war, sweeps away our fortunes, slaughters our sons, renders the labors of a life unavailing, and pushes on, helpless, with all our intellect to resist, into the grave.
These considerations ought to teach us that justice to others and to ourselves is the same; that we cannot
define our duties by mathematical lines ruled by the square, but must fill with them the great circle traced by the compasses; that the circle of humanity is the limit, and we are but the point in its centre,
the drops in the great Atlantic, the atom or particle, bound by a mys terious law of attraction which we term sympathy to every other atom in the mass; that the physical and moral welfare of others cannot be
indifferent to us; that we have a direct and immediate interest in the public morality and popular intelligence, in the wellbeing and physical comfort of the people at large. The ignorance of the people,
their pauperism and destitution, and consequent degradation, their brutalization and demoralization, are all diseases; and we cannot rise high enough above the people, nor shut ourselves up from them enough,
to escape the miasmatic contagion and the great magnetic currents.
Justice is peculiarly indispensable to nations. The unjust State is doomed of God to calamity and ruin. This is the teaching of the Eternal Wisdom and of history. "Righteousness exalteth a nation; but wrong
is a reproach to nations." "The Throne is established by Righteousness. Let the lips of the Ruler pronounce the sentence that is Divine; and his mouth do no wrong in judgment!" The nation that adds
province to province by fraud and violence, that encroaches on the weak and plunders its wards, and violates its treaties and the obligation of its contracts, and for the law of honor and fairdealing
substitutes the exigencies of greed and the base precepts of policy and craft and the ignoble tenets of expediency, is predestined to destruction; for here, as with the individual, the consequences of wrong
are inevitable and eternal.
A sentence is written against all that is unjust, written by God in the nature of man and in the nature of the Universe, because it is in the nature of the Infinite God. No wrong is really successful. The gain of
injustice is a loss; its pleasure, suffering. Iniquity often seems to prosper, but its success is its defeat and shame. If its consequences pass by the doer, they fall upon and crush his children. It is a philosophical,
physical, and moral truth, in the form of a threat, that God visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation of those who violate His laws. After a long while, the day of
reckoning always comes, to nation as to individual; and always the knave deceives himself, and proves a failure.

Hypocrisy is the homage that vice and wrong pay to virtue and justice. It is Satan attemptiog to clothe
himself in the angelic vesture of light. It is equally detestable in morals, politics, and religion; in the man and in the nation. To do injustice under the pretence of equity and fairness; to reprove vice in
public and commit it in private; to pretend to charitable opinion and censoriously condemn; to profess the principles of Masonic beneficence, and close the ear to the wail of distress and the cry of suffering;
to eulogize the intelligence of the people, and plot to deceive and betray them by means of their ignorance and simplicity; to prate of purity, and peculate; of honor, and basely abandon a sinking cause;
of disinterestedness, and sell one's vote for place and power, are hypocrisies as common as they are infamous and disgraceful. To steal the livery of the Court of God to serve the Devil withal; to pretend to
believe in a God of mercy and a Redeemer of love, and persecute those of a different faith; to devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; to preach continence, and wallow in lust; to
inculcate humility, and in pride surpass Lucifer; to pay tithe, and omit the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith; to strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel; to make clean the outside of the
cup and platter, keeping them full within of extortion and excess; to appear outwardly righteous unto men, but within be full of hypocrisy and iniquity, is indeed to be like unto whited sepulchres, which
appear beautiful outward, but are within full of bones of the dead and of all uncleanness.
The Republic cloaks its ambition with the pretence of a desire and duty to "extend the area of freedom," and claims it as its "manifest destiny" to annex other Republics or the States or Provinces of others to
itself, by open violence, or under obsolete, empty, and fraudulent titles. The Empire founded by a successful soldier, claims its ancient or natural boundaries, and makes necessity and its safety tlle plea
for open robbery. The great Merchant Nation, gaining foothold in the Orient, finds a continual necessity for extending its dominion by arms, and subjugates India. The great Royalties and Despotisms, without
a plea, partition among themselves a Kingdom, dismember Poland, and prepare to wrangle over the dominions of the Crescent. To maintain the balance of power is a plea for the obliteration of States.
Carthage, Genoa, and Venice, commercial Cities only, must acquire territory by force or fraud, and become States. Alexander marches to the Indus; Tamerlane seeks universal empire; the Saracens
conquer Spain and threaten Vienna.
The thirst for power is never satisfied. It is insatiable. Neither men nor nations ever have power enough. When Rome was the mistress of the world, the Emperors caused themselves to be worshipped as gods.
The Church of Rome claimed despotism over the soul, and over the whole life from the cradle to the grave. It gave and sold absolutions for past and future sins. It claimed to be infallible in matters of
faith. It decimated Europe to purge it of heretics. It decimated America to convert the Mexicans and Peruvians. It gave and took away thrones; and by excommunication and interdict closed the gates of
Paradise against Nations, Spain, haughty with its dominion over the Indies, endeavored to crush out Protestantism in the Netherlands, while Philip the Second married the Queen of England, and the pair
sought to win that kingdom back to its allegiance to the Papal throne. Afterward Spain attempted to conquer it with her "invincible" Armada. Napoleon set his relatives and captains on thrones, and

parcelled among them half of Europe. The Czar rules over an empire more gigantic than Rome. The history of all is or will be the same, acquisition, dismemberment, ruin. There is a judgment of God
against all that is unjust.
To seek to subjugate the will of others and take the soul captive, because it is the exercise of thc highest power, seems to be the highest object of human ambition. It is at the bottom of all proselyting and
propagandism, from that of Mesmer to that of the Church of Rome and the French Republic. That was the apostolate alike of Joshua and of Mahomet.
Masonry alone preaches Toleration, the right of man to abide by his own faith, the right of all States to
govern themselves. It rebukes alike the monarch who seeks to extend his dominions by conquest, the Church that claims the right to repress heresy by fire and steel, and the confederation of States that
insist on maintaining a union by force and restoring brotherhood by slaughter and subjugation.
It is natural, when we are wronged, to desire revenge; and to persuade ourselves that we desire it less for our own satisfaction than to prevent a repetition of the wrong, to which the doer would be encouraged
by immunity coupled with the profit of the wrong. To submit to be cheated is to encourage the cheater to continue; and we are quite apt to regard ourselves as God's chosen instruments to inflict His
vengeance, and for Him and in His stead to discourage wrong by making it fruitless and its punishment sure. Revenge has been said to be "a kind of wild justice;" but it is always taken in anger, and therefore
is unworthy of a great soul, which ought not to suffer its equanimity to be disturbed by ingratitude or villainy. The injuries done us by the base are as much unworthy of our angry notice as those done us by
the insects and the beasts; and when we crush the adder, or slay the wolf or hyena, we should do it without being moved to anger, and with no more feeling of revenge than we have in rooting up a
noxious weed.
And if it be not in human nature not to take revenge by way of punishment, let the Mason truly consider that in doing so he is God's agent, and so let his revenge be measured by justice and tempered by mercy.
The law of God is, that the consequences of wrong and cruelty and crime shall be their punishment; and the injured and the wronged and the indignant are as much His instruments to enforce that law, as
the diseases and public detestation, and the verdict of history and the execration of posterity are. No one will say that the Inquisitor who has racked and burned the innocent; the Spaniard who hewed Indian
infants, living, into pieces with his sword, and fed the mangled limbs to his bloodhounds; the military tyrant who has shot men without trial, the knave who has robbed or betrayed his State, the fraudulent
banker or bankrupt who has beggared orphans, the public officer who has violated his oath, the judge who has sold injustice, the legislator who has enabled Incapacity to work the ruin of the State, ought
not to be punished. Let them be so; and let the injured or the sympathizing be the instruments of God's just vengeance; but always out of a higher feeling than mere personal revenge.

Remember that every moral characteristic of man finds its prototype an1ong creatures of lower intelligence; that the cruel foulness of the hyena, the savage rapacity of the wolf, the merciless rage of
the tiger, the crafty treachery of the panther, are found among mankind, and ought to excite no other emotion, when found in the man, than when found in the beast. Why should the true man be angry with
the geese that hiss, the peacocks that strut, the asses that bray, and the apes that imitate and chatter, although they wear the human form? Always, also, it remains true, that it is more noble to forgive than
to take revenge; and that, in general, we ought too much to despise those who wrong us, to feel the emotion of anger, or to desire revenge.
At the sphere of the Sun, you are in the region of LIGHT. The Hebrew word for gold, ZAHAB, also
means Light, of which the Sun is to the Earth the great source. So, in the great Oriental allegory of the Hebrews, the River PISON compasses the land of Gold or Light; and the River GIHON the land of
Ethiopia or Darkness.
What light is, we no more know than the ancients did. According to the modern hypothesis, it is not composed of luminous particles shot out from the sun with immense velocity; but that body only
impresses, on the ether which fills all space, a powerful vibratory movement that extends, in the form of luminous waves, beyond the most distant planets, supplying them with light and heat. To the ancients, it
was an outflowing from the Deity. To us, as to them, it is the apt symbol of truth and knowledge. To us, also, the upward journey of the soul through the Spheres is symbolical; but we are as little informed as
they whence the soul comes, where it has its origin, and whither it goes after death. They endeavored to have some belief and faith, some creed, upon those points. At the present day, men are satisfied to think
nothing in regard to all that, and only to believe that the soul is a something separate from the body and outliving it, but whether existing before it, neither to inquire nor care. No one asks whether it emanates
from the Deity, or is created out of nothing, or is generated like the body, and the issue of the souls of the father and the mother. Let us not smile, therefore, at the ideas of the ancients, until we have a better
belief; but accept their symbols as meaning that the soul is of a Divine nature, originating in a sphere nearer the Deity, and returning to that when freed from the enthralhment of the body; and that it can
only return there when purified of all the sordidness and sin which have, as it were, become part of its substance, by its connection with the body.
It is not strange that, thousands of years ago, men worshipped the Sun, and that today that worship
continues among the Parsees. Originally they looked beyond the orb to the invisible God, of whom the Sun's light, seemingly identical with generation and life, was the manifestation and outflowing. Long
before the Chaldean shepherds watched it on their plains, it came up regularly, as it now does, in the morning, like a god, and again sank, like a king retiring, in the west, to return again in due time in the
same array of majesty. We worship Immutability. It was that steadfast, immutable character of the Sun that the men of Baalbec worshipped. His lightgiving and lifegiving powers were secondary attributes.
The one grand idea that compelled worship was the characteristic of God which they saw reflected in his light, and fancied they saw in its originality the changelessness of Deity. He had seen thrones

Beyond Olympus, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, he had gone daily to his abode, and had come daily again in the morning to behold the temples they built to his worsl1ip. They personified him as
BRAHMA, AMUN, OSRIS, BEL, ADONIS, MALKARTH, MITHRAS, and APOLLO; and the nations that did so grew old and died. Moss grew on the capitals of the great columns of his temples,
and he shone on the moss. Grain by grain the dust of his temples crumbled and fell, and was borne off on the wind, and still he shone on crumbling column and architrave. The roof fell crashing on the
pavement, and he shone in on the Holy of Holies with unchanging rays. It was not strange that men worshipped the Sun.
There is a waterplant, on whose broad leaves the drops of water roll about without uniting, like drops
of mercury. So arguments on points of faith, in politics or religion, roll over the surface of the mind. An argument that convinces one mind has no effect on another. Few intellects, or souls that are the
negations of intellect, have any logical power or capacity. There is a singular obliquity in the human mind that makes the false logic more effective than the true with ninetenths of those who are regarded
as men of intellect. Even among the judges, not one in ten can argue logically. Each mind sees the truth, distorted through its own medium. Truth, to most men, is like matter in the spheroidal state. Like a drop
of cold water on the surface of a redhot metal plate, it dances, trembles, and spins, and never comes into contact with it; and the mind may be plunged into truth, as the hand moistened with sulphurous
acid may into melted metal, and be not even warmed by the immersion.

The word Khairum or Khurum is a compound one. Gesenius renders Khurum by the word noble or freeborn: Khur meaning white, noble. It also means the opening of a window, the socket of the eye.
Khri also means white, or an opening; and Khris, the orb of the Sun, in Job viii. 13 and x. 7. Krishna is the Hindu SunGod. Khur, the Parsi word, is the literal name of the Sun.
From Kur or Khur, the Sun, comes Khora, a name of Lower Egypt. The Sun, Bryant says in his
Mythology, was called Kur; and Plutarch says that the Persians called the Sun Kuros. Kurios, Lord, in Greek, like Adonai, Lord, in Phcenician and Hebrew, was applied to the Sun. Many places were sacred
to the Sun, and called Kura, Kuria, Kuropolis, Kurene, Kureschata, Kuresta, and Corusia in Scythia.
The Egyptian Deity called by the Greeks "Horus," was HerRa, or Haroeris, Hor or Har, the Sun. Hari is a Hindu name of the Sun. Arial, Ares, Ar, Aryaman, Areimonios, the AR meaning Fire or Flame,
are of the same kindred. Hewnes or Harmes, (Aram, Remus, Haram, Harameias), was Kadmos, the Divine Light or Wisdom. Markuri, says Movers, is Mar, the Sun.

In the Hebrew, AOOR, is Light, Fire, or the Sun. Cyrus, said Ctesias, was so named from Kuros, the
Sun. Kuris, Hesychius says, was Adonis. Apollo, the Sungod, was called Kurraios, from Kurra, a city in Phocis. The people of Kurene, originally Ethiopians or Cuthites, worshipped the Sun under the title
of Achoor and Achor.
We know, through a precise testimony in the ancient annals of Tsur, that the principal festivity of Mal karth, the incarnation of the Sun at the Winter Solstice, held at Tsur, was called his rebirth or his
awakening, and that it was celebrated by means of a pyre, on which the god was supposed to regain, through the aid of fire, a new life. This festival was celebrated in the month Peritius (Barith), the second
day of which corresponded to the 25th of December. KHURUM, King of Tyre, Movers says, first performed this ceremony. These facts we learn from Josephus, Servius on the AEneid, and the
Dionysiacs of Nonnus; and through a coincidence that cannot be fortuitous, the same day was at Rome the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, the festal day of the invincible Sun. Under this title, HERCULES, HAR
acles, was worshipped at Tsur. Thus, while the temple was being erected, the death and resurrection of a SunGod was annually represented at Tsur, by Solomon's ally, at the winter solstice, by the pyre of
MALKARIH, the Tsurian Haracles.
AROERIS or HARoeris, the elder HORUS, is from the same old root that in the Hebrew has the form Aur, or, with the definite article prefixed, Haur, Light, or the Light, splendor, flame, the Sun and his
rays. The hieroglyphic of the younger HORUS was the point in a circle; of the Elder, a pair of eyes; and the festival of the thirtieth day of the month Epiphi, when the sun and moon were supposed to be in the
same right line with the earth, was called "The birthday of the eyes of Horus."
In a papyrus published by Champollion, this god is styled "Haroeri, Lord of the Solar Spirits, the beneficent eye of the Sun." Plutarch calls him "Harpocrates," but there is no trace of the latter part of
the name in the hieroglyphic legends. He is the son of OSIRIS and Isis and is represented sitting on a throne supported by lions; the same word, in Egyptian, meaning Lion and Sun. So Solomon made a
great throne of ivory, plated with gold, with six steps, at each arm of which was a lion, and one on each side to each step, making seven on each side.
Again, the Hebrew word Khi, means "living" and ram, "was, or shall be, raised or lifted up." The latter
is the same as room, aroom, harum, whence Aram, for Syria, or Aramoea, Highland. Khairum, therefore, would mean "was raised up to life, or living."
So, in Arabic, hrm, an unused root, meant, "was high", "made great", "exalted" and Hirm means an ox,
the symbol of the Sun in Taurus, at the Vernal Equinox.

KHURUM, therefore, improperly called Hiram, is KHUROM, the same as Herra, Hermes, and Her acles, the "Heracles Tyrius Invictus," the personification of Light and the Son, the Mediator, Redeemer,
and Saviour. From the Egyptian word Ra came the Coptic Ouro, and the Hebrew Aur, Light. Haroeri, is Hor or Har, the chief or master. Hor is also heat; and hora, season or hour; and hence in several
African dialects, as names of the Sun, Airo, Ayero, eer, uiro, ghurrah, and the like. The royal name rendered Pharaoh, was PHRA, that is, Paira, the Sun.
The legend of the contest between Horra and Set, or Setnubi, the same as Bar or Bal, is older than
that of the strife between Osiris and Typhon; as old, at least, as the nineteenth dynasty. It is called in the Book of the Dead, "The day of the battle between Horus and Set." The later myth connects itself with
Phoenicia and Syria. The body of OSIRIS went ashore at Gebal or Byblos, sixty miles above Tsur. You will not fail to notice that in the name of each murderer of Khurum, that of the Evil God Bal is found.
*****
Haroeri was the god of TIME, as well as of Life. The Egyptian legend was that the King of Byblos cut
down the tamarisktree containing the body of OSIRIS, and made of it a column for his palace. Isis, employed in the palace, obtained possession of the column, took the body out of it, and carried it away.
Apuleius describes her as "a beautiful female, over whose divine neck her long thick hair hung in graceful ringlets ;" and in the procession female attendants, with ivory combs, seemed to dress and
ornament the royal hair of the goddess. The palmtree, and the lamp in the shape of a boat, appeared in the procession. If the symbol we are speaking of is not a mere modern invention, it is to these things it
alludes.
The identity of the legends is also confirmed by this hieroglyphic picture, copied from an ancient Egyptian monument, which may also enlighten you as to the Lion's grip and the Master's gavel.
In the ancient Phoenician character, and in the Samaritan, A B, (the two letters representing the
numbers 1, 2, or Unity and Duality, means Father, and is a primitive noun, common to all the Semitic languages. It also means an Ancestor, Originator, Inventor, Head, Chief or Ruler, Manager, Overseer,
Master, Priest, Prophet.
Is simply Father, when it is in construction, that is, when it precedes another word, and in English the preposition "of" is interposed, as AbiAl, the Father of Al. Also, the final Yod means "my"; so that by
itself means "My father. David my father, 2 Chron. ii. 3.
(Vav) final is the possessive pronoun "his"; and Abiu (which we read "Abif") means "of my father's."

Its full meaning, as connected with the name of Khurum, no doubt is, "formerly one of my father's servants," or "slaves."
The name of the Phoenician artificer is, in Samuel and Kings, [2 Sam. v. 11; 1 Kings v. 15; 1 Kings vii.

It is merely absurd to add the word "Abif," or "Abiff," as part of the name of the artificer. And it is almost as absurd to add the word "Abi," which was a title and not part of the name. Joseph says [Gen.
xlv. 8], "God has constituted me 'Ab l'Paraah, as Father to Paraah, i.e., Vizier or Prime Minister." So Haman was called the Second Father of Artaxerxes; and when King Khurum used the phrase "Khurum
Abi," he meant that the artificer he sent Schlomoh was the principal or chief workman in his line at Tsur.
A medal copied by Montfaucon exhibits a female nursing a child, with ears of wheat in her hand, and
the legend (Iao). She is seated on clouds, a star at her head, and three ears of wheat rising from an altar before her.
HORUS was the mediator, who was buried three days, was regenerated, and triumphed over the evil
principle.
The word HERI, in Sanscrit, means Shepherd, as well as Savior. CRISHNA is called Heri, as Jesus called Himself the Good Shepherd.
Khur, means an aperture of a window, a cave, or the eye. Also it means white. It also means an opening,
and noble, freeborn, highborn.
KHURM means consecrated, devoted; in AEthiopic. It is the name of a city, [Josh. xix. 38]; and of a man, [Ezr. ii. 32, x. 31; Neh. iii. 11].
Khirah, means nobility, a noble race.
Buddha is declared to comprehend in his own person the essence of the Hindu Trimurti; and hence the
triliteral monosyllable Om or Aum is applied to him as being essentially the same as BrahmaVishnu Siva. He is the same as Hermes, Thoth, Taut, and Teutates. One of his names is Herimaya or Hermaya,
which are evidently the same name as Hermes and Khirm or Khurm. Heri, in Sanscrit, means Lord.

A learned Brother places over the two symbolic pillars, from right to left, the two words IHU and BAL:
followed by the hieroglyphic equivalent, of the SunGod, Amunra. Is it an accidental coincidence, that in the name of each murderer are the two names of the Good and Evil Deities of the Hebrews; for Yu
bel is but YehuBal or YehoBal? and that the three final syllables of the names, a, o, um, make A.'.U.'.M.'. the sacred word of the Hindoos, meaning the Triune God, Lifegiving, Lifepreserving, Life
destroying: represented by the mystic character?
The genuine acacia, also, is the thorny tamarisk, the same tree which grew up around the body of Osiris. It was a sacred tree among the Arabs, who made of it the idol AlUzza, which Mohammed
destroyed. It is abundant as a bush in the Desert of Thur: and of it the "crown of thorns" was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of Nazareth. It is a fit type of immortality on account of its
tenacity of life; for it has been known, when planted as a doorpost, to take root again and shoot out budding boughs over the threshold.

Every commonwealth must have its periods of trial and transition, especially if it engages in war. It is
certain at some time to be wholly governed by agitators appealing to all the baser elements of the popular nature; by moneyed corporations; by those enriched by the depreciation of government
securities or paper; by small attorneys, schemers, moneyjobbers, speculators and adventurers an ignoble oligarchy, enriched by the distresses of the State, and fattened on the miseries of the people.
Then all the deceitful visions of equality and the rights of man end; and the wronged and plundered State can regain a real liberty only by passing through "great varieties of untried being," purified in its
transmigration by fire and blood.
In a Republic, it soon comes to pass that parties gather round the negative and positive poles of some opinion or notion, and that the intolerant spirit of a triumphant majority will allow no deviation from
the standard of orthodoxy which it has set up for itself. Freedom of opinion will be professed and pretended to, but every one will exercise it at the peril of being banished from political communion
with those who hold the reins and prescribe the policy to be pursued. Slavishness to party and obsequiousness to the popular whims go hand in hand. Political independence only occurs in a fossil
state; and men's opinions grow out of the acts they have been constrained to do or sanction. Flattery, either of individual or people, corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation is not of more
service to the people than to kings. A Caesar, securely seated in power, cares less for it than a free democracy; nor will his appetite for it grow to exorbitance, as that of a people will, until it becomes
insatiate. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they please; to a people, it is to a great extent the same. If accessible to flattery, as this is always interested, and resorted to on low and
base motives, and for evil purposes, either individual or people is sure, in doing what it pleases, to do

what in honor and conscience should have been left undone. One ought not even to risk congratulations, which may soon be turned into complaints; and as both individuals and peoples are
prone to make a bad use of power, to flatter them, which is a sure way to mislead them, well deserves to be called a crime.
The first principle in a Republic ought to be, "that no man or set of men is entitled to exclusive or
separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services; which not being descendible, neither ought the omces of magistrate, legislature, nor judge, to be hereditary." It
is a volume of Truth and Wisdom, a lesson for the study of nations, embodied in a single sentence, and expressed in language which every man can understand. If a deluge of despotism were to overthrow the
world, and destroy all institutions under which freedom is protected, so that they should no longer be remembered among men, this sentence, preserved, would be sufficient to rekindle the fires of liberty
and revive the race of freemen.
But, to preserve liberty, another must be added: "that a free State does not confer office as a reward, especially for questionable services, unless she seeks her own ruin; but all officers are employed by her,
in consideration solely of their will and ability to render service in the future; and therefore that the best and most competent are always to be preferred."
For, if there is to be any other rule, that of hereditary succession is perhaps as good as any. By no other
rule is it possible to preserve the liberties of the State. By no other to intrust the power of making the laws to those only who have that keen instinctive sense of injustice and wrong which enables them to
detect baseness and corruption in their most secret hidingplaces, and that moral courage and generous manliness and gallant independence that make them fearless in dragging out the perpetrators to the light
of day, and calling down upon them the scorn and indignation of the world. The flatterers of the people are never such men. On the contrary, a time always comes to a Republic, when it is not content, like
Liberius, with a single Sejanus, but must have a host; and when those most prominent in the lead of affairs are men without reputation, statesmanship, ability, or information, the mere hacks of party,
owing their places to trickery and want of qualification, with none of the qualities of head or heart that make great and wise men, and, at the same time, filled with all the narrow conceptions and bitter
intolerance of political bigotry. These die; and the world is none the wiser for what they have said and done. Their names sink in the bottomless pit of oblivion; but their acts of folly or knavery curse the
body politic and at last prove its ruin.
Politicians, in a free State, are generally hollow, heartless, and selfish. Their own aggrandisement is the end of their patriotism; and they always look with secret satisfaction on the disappointment or fall of
one whose loftier genius and superior talents overshadow their own selfimportance, or whose integrity and incorruptible honor are in the way of their selfish ends. The influence of the small aspirants is
always against the great man. His accession to power may be almost for a lifetime. One of themselves

will be more easily displaced, and each hopes to succeed him; and so it at length comes to pass that men impudently aspire to and actually win the highest stations, who are unfit for the lowest clerkships;
and incapacity and mediocrity become the surest passports to once.
The consequence is, that those who feel themselves competent and qualified to serve the people, refuse with digust to enter into the struggle for office, where the wicked and jesuitical doctrine that all is fair
in politics is an excuse for every species of low villainy; and those who seek even the highest places of the State do not rely upon the power of a magnanimous spirit, on the sympathizing impulses of a great
soul, to stir and move the people to generous, noble, and heroic resolves, and to wise and manly action; but, like spaniels erect on their hind legs, with forepaws obsequiously suppliant, fawn, flatter, and
actually beg for votes. Rather than descend to this, they stand contemptuously aloof, disdainfully refusing to court the people, and acting on the maxim, that "mankind has no title to demand that we
shall serve them in spite of themselves".

It is lamentable to see a country split into factions, each following this or that great or brazenfronted leader with a blind, unreasoning, unquestioning heroworship; it is contemptible to see it divided into
parties, whose sole end is the spoils of victory, and their chiefs the low, the base, the venal and the snlall. Such a country is in the last stages of decay, and near its end, no matter how prosperous it may
seem to be. It wrangles over the volcano and the earthquake. But it is certain that no government can be conducted by the men of the people, and for the people, without a rigid adherence to those principles
which our reason commends as fixed and sound. These must be the tests of parties, men, and measures. Once determined, they must be inexorable in their application, and all must either come up to the
standard or declare against it. Men may betray: principles never can. Oppression is one invariable consequence of misplaced confidence in treacherous man, it is never the result of the working or
application of a sound, just, welltried principle. Compromises which bring fundamental principles into doubt, in order to unite in one party men of antagonistic creeds, are frauds, and end in ruin, the just and
natural consequence of fraud. Whenever you have settled upon your theory and creed, sanction no departure from it in practice, on any ground of expediency. It is the Master's word. Yield it up neither to
flattery nor force! Let no defeat or persecution rob you of it! Believe that he who once blundered in statesmanship will blunder again; that such blunders are as fatal as crimes; and that political near
sightedness does not improve by age. There are always more impostors than seers among public men, more false prophets than true ones, more prophets of Baal than of Jehovah; and Jerusalem is always in
danger from the Assyrians.
Sallust said that after a State has been corrupted by luxury and idleness, it may by its mere greatness bear up under the burden of its vices. But even while he wrote, Rome, of which he spoke, had played

larger neighbors extinguish them by absorption. If of great extent, the cohesive force is too feeble to hold them together, and they fall to pieces by their own weight. The paltry ambition of small men
disintegrates them. The want of wisdom in their councils creates exasperating issues. Usurpation of power plays its part, incapacity seconds corruption, the storm rises, and the fragments of the incoherent
raft strew the sandy shores, reading to mankind another lesson for it to disregard.
The Fortyseventh Proposition is older than Pythagoras. It is this: "In every rightangled triangle, the sum of the squares of the base and perpendicular is equal to the square of the hypothenuse".
The square of a number is the product of that number, multiplied by itself. Thus, 4 is the square of 2,
and 9 of 3.
The first ten numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10;
their squares are ...........1, 4, 9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100;
and ..........................3, 5, 7, 9,11,13,15,17, 19
are the differences between each square and that which precedes it; giving us the sacred numbers, 3, 5, 7, and 9
Of these numbers, the square of 3 and 4, added together, gives the square of 5; and those of 6 and 8, the
square of 10; and if a rightangled triangle be formed, the base measuring 3 or 6 parts, and the perpendicular 4 or 8 parts, the hypothenuse will be 5 or 10 parts; and if a square is erected on each side,
these squares being subdivided into squares each side of which is one part in length, there will be as many of these in the square erected on the hypothenuse as in the other two squares together.
Now the Egyptians arranged their deities in Triads the FATHER or the Spirit or Active Principle or
Generative Power; the MOTHER, or Matter, or the Passive Principle, or the Conceptive Power; and the SON, Issue or Product, the Universe, proceeding from the two principles. These were OSRIS, ISIS, and
HORUS. In the same way, PLATO gives us thought the Father; Primitive Matter the Mother; and Kosmos the World, the Son, the Universe animated by a soul. Triads of the same kind are found in the
Kabalah.
PLUTARCH says, in his book De Iside et Osiride, "But the better and diviner nature consists of three,

74/641
that which exists within the Intellect only, and Matter, and that which proceeds from these, which the Greeks call Kosmos; of which three, Plato is wont to call the Intelligible, the 'Idea, Exemplar, and
Father', Matter, 'the Mother, the Nurse, and the place and receptacle of generation'; and the issue of these two, 'the Offspring and Genesis,"' the KOSMOS, "a word signifying equally Beauty and Order, or
the Universe itself." You will not fail to notice that Beauty is symbolized by the Junior Warden in the South. Plutarch continues to say that the Egyptians compared the universal nature to what they called
the most beautiful and perfect triangle, as Plato does, in that nuptial diagram, as it is termed, which he has introduced into his Commonwealth. When he adds that this triangle is rightangled, and its sides
respectively as 3, 4, and 5; and he says, "We must suppose that the perpendicular is designed by them to represent the masculine nature, the base the feminine, and that the hypothenuse is to be looked upon as
the offspring of both; and accordingly the first of them will aptly enough represent OSIRIS, or the prime cause; the second, ISIS, or the receptive capacity; the last, HORUS, or the common effect of the
other two. For 3 is the first number which is composed of even and odd; and 4 is a square whose side is equal to the even number 2; but 5, being generated, as it were, out of the preceding numbers, 2 and 3,
may be said to have an equal relation to both of them, as to its common parents."

The clasped hands is another symbol which was used by PYTHAGORAS. It represented the number 10, the sacred number in which all the preceding numbers were contained; the number expressed by the
mysterious TERACTYS, a figure borrowed by him and the Hebrew priests alike from the Egyptian sacred science, and which ought to be replaced among the symbols of the Master's degree, where it of
right belongs. The Hebrews formed it thus, with the letters of the Divine name:
The Tetractys thus leads you, not only to the study of the Pythagorean philosophy as to numbers, but also to the Kabalah, and will aid you in discovering the True Word, and understanding what was meant
by "The Music of the Spheres". Modern science strikingly confirms the ideas of Pythagoras in regard to the properties of numbers, and that they govern in the Universe. Long before his time, nature had
extracted her cuberoots and her squares.

All the FORCES at man's disposal or under man's control, or subject to man's influence, are his working tools. The friendship and sympathy that knit heart to heart are a force like the attraction of
cohesion, by which the sandy particles became the solid rock. If this law of attraction or cohesion were taken away, the material worlds and suns would dissolve in an instant into thin invisible vapor. If the
ties of friendship, affection, and love were annulled, mankind would become a raging multitude of wild and savage beasts of prey. The sand hardens into rock under the immense superincumbent pressure of

the ocean, aided sometimes by the irresistible energy of fire; and when the pressure of calamity and danger is upon an order or a country, the members or the citizens ought to be the more closely united by
the cohesion of sympathy and interdependence.
Morality is a force. It is the magnetic attraction of the heart toward Truth and Virtue. The needle, imbued with this mystic property, and pointing unerringly to the north, carries the mariner safely over
the trackless ocean, through storm and darkness, until his glad eyes behold the beneficent beacons that welcome him to safe and hospitable harbor. Then the hearts of those who love him are gladdened, and
his home made happy; and this gladness and happiness are due to the silent, unostentatious, unerring monitor that was the sailor's guide over the weltering waters. But if drifted too far northward, he finds
the needle no longer true, but pointing elsewhere than to the north, what a feeling of helplessness falls upon the dismayed mariner, what utter loss of energy and courage! It is as if the great axioms of
morality were to fail and be no longer true, leaving the human soul to drift helplessly, eyeless like Prometheus, at the mercy of the uncertain, faithless currents of the deep.
Honor and Duty are the polestars of a Mason, the Dioscuri, by never losing sight of which he may
avoid disastrous shipwreck. These Palinurus watched, until, overcome by sleep, and the vessel no longer guided truly, he fell into and was swallowed up by the insatiable sea. So the Mason who loses sight of
these, and is no longer governed by their beneficent and potential force, is lost, and sinking out of sight, will disappear unhonored and unwept.
The force of electricity, analogous to that of sympathy, and by means of which great thoughts or base
suggestions, the utterances of noble or ignoble natures, flash instantaneously over the nerves of nations; the force of growth, fit type of immortality, Iying dormant three thousand years in the wheatgrains
buried with their mummies by the old Egyptians; the forces of expansion and contraction, developed in the earthquake and the tornado, and giving birth to the wonderful achievements of steam, have their
parallelisms in the moral world, in individuals, and nations. Growth is a necessity for nations as for men. Its cessation is the beginning of decay. In the nation as well as the plant it is mysterious, and it is
irresistible. The earthquakes that rend nations asunder, overturn thrones, and engulf monarchies and republics, have been long prepared for, like the volcanic eruption. Revolutions have long roots in the
past. The force exerted is in direct proportion to the previous restraint and compression. The true statesman ought to see in progress the causes that are in due time to produce them; and he who does not
is but a blind leader of the blind.
The great changes in nations, like the geological changes of the earth, are slowly and continuously wrought. The waters, falling from Heaven as rain and dews, slowly disintegrate the granite mountains;
abrade the plains, leaving hills and ridges of denudation as their monuments; scoop out the valleys, fill up the seas, narrow the rivers, and after the lapse of thousands on thousands of silent centuries, prepare

of the world, and the abundance or penury of whose crops shall determine whether the weavers and spinners of other realms shall have work to do or starve.
So Public Opinion is an immense force; and its currents are as inconstant and incomprehensible as
those of the atmosphere. Nevertheless, in free governments, it is omnipotent; and the business of the statesman is to find the means to shape, control, and direct it. According as that is done, it is beneficial
and conservative, or destructive and ruinous. The Public Opinion of the civilized world is International Law; and it is so great a force, though with no certain and fixed boundaries, that it can even constrain
the victorious despot to be generous, and aid an oppressed people in its struggle for independence.
Habit is a great force; it is second nature, even in trees. It is as strong in nations as in men. So also are Prejudices, which are given to men and nations as the passions are, as forces, valuable, if properly and
skillfully availed of; destructive, if unskillfully handled.
Above all, the Love of Country, State Pride, the Love of Home, are forces of immense power. Encourage them all. Insist upon them in your public men. Permanency of home is necessary to
patriotism. A migratory race will have little love of country. State pride is a mere theory and chimera, where men remove from State to State with indifference, like the Arabs, who camp here today and
there tomorrow.
If you have Eloquence, it is a mighty force. See that you use it for good purposesto teach, exhort, ennoble the people, and not to mislead and corrupt them. Corrupt and venal orators are the assassins of
the public liberties and of public morals.
The Will is a force; its limits as yet unknown. It is in the power of the will that we chiefly see the spiritual and divine in man. There is a seeming identity between his will that moves other men, and the
Creative Will whose action seems so incomprehensible. It is the men of will and action, not the men of pure intellect, that govern the world.
Finally, the three greatest moral forces are FAITH, which is the only true WISDOM, and the very
foundation of all government; HOPE, which is STRENGTH, and insures success; and CHARITY, which is BEAUTY, and alone makes animated, united effort possible. These forces are within the reach
of all men; and an association of men, actuated by them, ought to exercise an immense power in the world. If Masonry does not, it is because she has ceased to possess them.
Wisdom in the man or statesman, in king or priest, largely consists in the due appreciation of these
forces; and upon the general nonappreciation of some of them the fate of nations often depends. What

hecatombs of lives often hang upon the not weighing or not sumciently weighing the force of an idea, such as, for example, the reverence for a flag, or the blind attachment to a form or constitution of
government!
What errors in political economy and statesmanship are committed in consequence of the over estimation or underestimation of particular values, or the nonestimation of some among them!
Everything, it is asserted, is the product of human labor; but the gold or the diamond which one accidentally finds without labor is not so. What is the value of the labor bestowed by the husbandman
upon his crops, compared with the value of the sunshine and rain, without which his labor avails nothing? Commerce carried on by the labor of man, adds to the value of the products of the field, the
mine, or the workshop, by their transportation to different markcts; but how much of this increase is due to the rivers down which these products float, to the winds that urge the keels of commerce over the
ocean!
Who can estimate the value of morality and manliness in a State, of moral worth and intellectual knowledge? These are the sunshine and rain of the State. The winds, with their changeable, fickle,
fluctuating currents, are apt emblems of the fickle humors of the populace, its passions, its heroic impulses, its enthusiasms. Woe to the statesman who does not estimate these as values!
Even music and song are sometimes found to have an incalculable value. Every nation has some song
of a proven value, more easily counted in lives than dollars. The Marseillaise was worth to revolutionary France, who shall say how many thousand men?
Peace also is a great element of prosperity and wealth; a value not to be calculated. Social intercourse
and association of men in beneficent Orders have a value not to be estimated in coin. The illustrious examples of the Past of a nation, the memories and immortal thoughts of her great and wise thinkers,
statesmen, and heroes, are the invaluable legacy of that Past to the Present and Future. And all these have not only the values of the loftier and more excellent and priceless kind, but also an actual money
value, since it is only when cooperating with or aided or enabled by these, that human labor creates wealth. They are of the chief elements of material wealth, as they are of national manliness, heroism,
glory, prosperity, and immortal renown.
Providence has appointed the three great disciplines of War, the Monarchy and the Priesthood, all that the CAMP, the PALACE, and the TEMPLE may symbolize, to train the multitudes forward to
intelligent and premeditated combinations for all the great purposes of society. The result will at length be free governments among men, when virtue and intelligence become qualities of the multitudes; but
for ignorance such governments are impossible. Man advances only by degrees. The removal of one pressing calamity gives courage to attempt the removal of the remaining evils, rendering men more

sensitive to them, or perhaps sensitive for the first time. Serfs that writhe under the whip are not disquieted about their political rights; manumitted from personal slavery, they be come sensitive to
political oppression. Liberated from arbitrary power, and governed by the law alone, they begin to scrutinize the law itself, and desire to be governed, not only by law, but by what they deem the best law.
And when the civil or temporal despotism has been set aside, and the municipal law has been moulded on the principles of an enlightened jurisprudence, they may wake to the discovery that they are living
under some priestly or ecclesiastical despotism, and become desirous of working a reformation there also.
It is quite true that the advance of humanity is slow, and that it often pauses and retrogrades. In the
kingdoms of the earth we do not see despotisms retiring and yielding the ground to selfgoverning communities. We do not see the churches and priesthoods of Christendom relinquishing their old task
of governing men by imaginary terrors. Nowhere do we see a populace that could be safely manumitted from such a government. We do not see the great religious teachers aiming to discover truth for
themselves and for others; but still ruling the world, and contented and compelled to rule the world, by whatever dogma is already accredited; themselves as much bound down by this necessity to govern, as
the populace by their need of government. Poverty in all its most hideous forms still exists in the great cities; and the cancer of pauperism has its roots in the hearts of kingdoms. Men there take no measure
of their wants and their own power to supply them, but live and multiply like the beasts of the field, Providence having apparently ceased to care for them. Intelligence never visits these, or it makes its
appearance as some new development of villainy. War has not ceased; still there are battles and sieges. Homes are still unhappy, and tears and anger aud spite make hells where there should be heavens. So
much the more necessity for Masonry! So much wider the field of its labors! So much the more need for it to begin to be true to itself, to revive from its asphyxia, to repent of its apostasy to its true creed!
Undoubtedly, labor and death and the sexual passion are essential and permanent conditions of human
existence, and render perfection and a millennium on earth impossible. Always, it is the decree of Fate! The vast majority of men must toil to live, and cannot find time to cultivate the intelligence. Man,
knowing he is to die, will not sacrifice the present enjoyment for a greater one in the future. The love of woman cannot die out; and it has a terrible and uncontrollable fate, increased by the refinements of
civilization. Woman is the veritable siren or goddess of the young. But society can be improved; and free government is possible for States; and freedom of thought and conscience is no longer wholly
utopian. Already we see that Emperors prefer to be elected by universal suffrage; that States are conveyed to Empires by vote; and that Empires are administered with something of the spirit of a
Republic, being little else than democracies with a single head, ruling through one man, one representative, instead of an assembly of representatives. And if Priesthoods still govern, they now
come before the laity to prove, by stress of argument, that they ougllt to govern. They are obliged to evoke the very reason which they are bent on supplanting.
Accordingly, men become daily more free, because the freedom of the man lies in his reason. He can

reflect upon his own future conduct, and summon up its consequences; he can take wide views of human life, and lay down rules for constant guidance. Thus he is relieved of the tyranny of sense and
passion, and enabled at any time to live according to the whole light of the knowledge that is within him, instead of being driven, like a dry leaf on the wings of the wind, by every present impulse. Herein
lies the freedom of the man as regarded in connection with the necessity imposed by the omnipotence and foreknowledge of God. So much light, so much liberty. When emperor and church appeal to reason
there is naturally universal suffrage.
Therefore no one need lose courage, nor believe that labor in the cause of Progress will be labor wasted. There is no waste in nature, either of Matter, Force, Act, or Thought. A Thought is as much the end of
life as an Action; and a single Thought sometimes works greater results than a Revolution, even Revolutions themselves. Still there should not be divorce between Thought and Action. The true
Thought is that in which life culminates. But all wise and true Thought produces Action. It is generative, like the light; and light and the deep shadow of the passing cloud are the gifts of the
prophets of the race. Knowledge, laboriously acquired, and inducing habits of sound Thought, the reflective character, must necessarily be rare. The multitude of laborers cannot acquire it. Most men
attain to a very low standard of it. It is incompatible with the ordinary and indispensable avocations of life. A whole world of error as well as of labor, go to make one reflective man. In the most advanced
nation of Europe there are more ignorant than wise, more poor than rich, more autornatic laborers, the mere creatures of habit, than reasoning and reflective men. The proportion is at least a thousand to one.
Unanimity of opinion is so obtained. It only exists among the multitude who do not think, and the political or spiritual priesthood who think for that multitude, who think how to guide and govern them.
When men begin to reflect, they begin to differ. The great problem is to find guides who will not seek to be tyrants. This is needed even more in respect to the heart than the head. Now, every man earns his
special share of the produce of human labor, by an incessant scramble, by trickery and deceit. Useful knowledge, honorably acquired, is too often used after a fashion not honest or reasonable, so that the
studies of youth are far more noble than the practices of manhood. The labor of the farmer in his fields, the generous returns of the earth, the benignant and favoring skies, tend to make him earnest, provident,
and grateful; the education of the marketplace makes him querulous, crafty, envious, and an intolerable niggard.
Masonry seeks to be this beneficent, unambitious, disinterested guide; and it is the very condition of all
great structures that the sound of the hammer and the clink of the trowel should be always heard in some part of the building. With faith in man, hope for the future of humanity, lovingkindness for our
fellows, Masonry and the Mason must always work and teach. Let each do that for which he is best fitted. The teacher also is a workman. Praiseworthy as the active navigator is, who comes and goes and
makes one clime partake of the treasures of the other, and one to share the treasures of all, he who keeps the beaconlight upon the hill is also at his post.

some of the links of the chains that held men's souls in bondage. That there has been progress needs no other demonstration than that you may now reason with men, and urge upon them, without danger of
the rack or stake, that no doctrines can be apprehended as truths if they contradict each other, or contradict other truths given us by God. Long before the Reformation, a monk, who had found his way
to heresy without the help of Martin Luther, not venturine to breathe aloud into any living ear his anti papal and treasonable doctrines, wrote them on parchment, and sealing up theperilous record, hid it in
the massive walls of his monastery. There was no friend or brother to whom he could intrust his secret or pour forth his soul. It was some consolation to imagine that in a future age some one might find the
parchment, and the seed be found not to have been sown in vain. What if the truth should have to lie dormant as long before germinating as the wheat in the Egyptian mummy ? Speak it, nevertheless,
again and again, and let it take its chance!
The rose of Jericho grows in the sandy deserts of Arabia and on the Syrian housetops. Scarcely six inches high, it loses its leaves after the flowering season, and dries up into the form of a ball. Then it is
uprooted by the winds, and carried, blown, or tossed across the desert, into the sea. There, feeling the contact of the water, it unfolds itself, expands its branches, and expels its seeds from their seedvessels.
These, when saturated with water, are carried by the tide and laid on the seashore. Many are lost, as many individual lives of men are useless. But many are thrown back again from the seashore into the
desert, where, by the virtue of the seawater that they have imbibed, the roots and leaves sprout and they grow into fruitful plants, which will, in their turns, like their ancestors, be whirled into the sea.
God will not be less careful to provide for the germination of the truths you may boldly utter forth. "Cast" He has said, "thy bread upon the waters, and after many days it shall return to thee again".
Initiation does not change: we find it again and again, and always the same, through all the ages. The
last disciples of Pascalis Martinez are still the children of Orpheus; but they adore the realizer of the antique philosophy, the Incarnate Word of the Christians.
Pythagoras, the great divulger of the philosophy of numbers, visited all the sanctuaries of the world. He
went into Judaea, where he procured himself to be circumcised, that he might be admitted to the secrets of the Kabalah, which the prophets Ezekiel and Daniel, not without some reservations, communicated
to him. Then, not without some difficulty, he succeeded in being admitted to the Egyptian initiation, upon the recommendation of King Amasis. The power of his genius supplied the deficiencies of the
imperfect communications of the Hierophants, and he himself became a Master and a Revealer.
Pythagoras defined God: a Living and Absolute Verity clothed with Light. He said that the Word was Number manifested by Form. He made all descend from the Tetyactys, that is to say, from the
Quaternary. God, he said again, is the Supreme Music, the nature of which is Harmony.

Pythagoras gave the magistrates of Crotona this great religious, political and social precept: "There is no evil that is not preferable to Anarchy."
Pythagoras said, "Even as there are three divine notions and free intelligible regions, so there is a triple
word, for the Hierarehical Order always manifests itself by threes. There are the word simple, the word hieroglyphical, and the word symbolic: in other terms, there are the word that expresses, the word that
conceals, and the word that signifies; the whole hieratic intelligence is in the perfect knowledge of these three degrees."
Pythagoras enveloped doctrine with symbols, but carefully eschewed personifications and images,
which, he thought, sooner or later produced idolatry.
The Holy Kabalah, or tradition of the children of Seth, was carried from Chaldcea by Abraham, taught to the Egyptian priesthood by Joseph, recovered and purified by Moses, concealed under symbols in the
Bible, revealed by the Saviour to Saint John, and contained, entire, under hieratic figures analogous to those of all antiquity, in the Apocalypse of that Apostle.
The Kabalists consider God as the Intelligent, Animated, Living Infinite. He is not, for them, either the
aggregate of existences, or existence in the abstract, or a being philosophically definable. He is in all, distinct from all, and greater than all. His name even is ineffable; and yet this name only expresses the
human ideal of His divinity. What God is in Himself, it is not given to man to comprehend.
God is the absolute of Faith; but the absolute of Reason is BEING, "I am that I am," is a wretched translation.
Being, Existence, is by itself, and because it Is. The reason of Being, is Being itself. We may inquire,
"Why does something exist?" that is, "Why does such or such a thing exist?" But we cannot, without being absurd, ask, "Why Is Being?" That would be to suppose Being before Being. If Being had a
cause, that cause would necessarily Be; that is, the cause and effect would be identical.
Reason and science demonstrate to us that the modes of Existence and Being balance each other in equilibrium according to harmonious and hierarchic laws. But a hierarchy is synthetized, in ascending,
and becomes ever more and more monarchial. Yet the reason cannot pause at a simle chief, without being alarmed at the abysses which it seems to leave above this Supreme Monarch. Therefore it is
silent, and gives place to the Faith it adores.

What is certain, even for science and the reason, is, that the idea of God is the grandest, the most holy, and the most useful of all the aspirations of man; that upon this belief morality reposes, with its eternal
sanction. This belief, then, is in humanity, the most real of the phenomena of being; and if it were false, nature would affirm the absurd; nothingness would give form to life, and God would at the same time
be and not be.
It is to this philosophic and incontestable reality, which is termed The Idea of God, that the Kabalists give a name. In this name all others are contained. Its cyphers contain all the numbers; and the
hieroglyphics of its letters express all the laws and all the things of nature.
BEING IS BEING: the reason of Being is in Being: in the Beginning is the Word, and the Word in logic formulated Speech, the spoken Reason; the Word is in God, and is God Himself, manifested to the
Intelligence. Here is what is above all the philosophies. This we must believe, under the penalty of never truly knowing anything, and relapsing into the absurd skepticism of Pyrrho. The Priesthood,
custodian of Faith, wholly rests upon this basis of knowledge, and it is in its teachings we must recognize the Divine Principle of the Eternal Word.
Light is not Spirit, as the Indian Hierophants believed it to be; but only the instrument of the Spirit. It is
not the body of the Protoplastes, as the Theurgists of the school of Alexandria taught, but the first physical manifestation of the Divine afflatus. God eternally creates it, and man, in the image of God,
modifies and seems to multiply it.
The high magic is styled "The Sacerdotal Art," and "The Royal Art." In Egypt, Greece, and Rome, it could not but share the greatnesses and decadences of the Priesthood and of Royalty. Every philosophy
hostile to the national worship and to its mysteries, was of necessity hostile to the great political powers, whichlose their grandeur, if they cease, in the eyes of the multitudes, to be the images of the Divine
Power. Every Crown is shattered, when it clashes against the Tiara.
Plato, writing to Dionysius the Younger, in regard to the nature of the First Principle, says: "I must write to you in enigmas, so that if my letter be intercepted by land or sea, he who shall read it may in no
degree comprehend it." And then he says, "All things surround their King; they are, on account of Him, and He alone is the cause of good things, Second for the Seconds and Third for the Thirds."
There is in these few words a complete summary of the Theology of the Sephiroth. "The King" is
AINSOPH, Being Supreme and Absolute. From this centre, which is everywhere, all things ray forth; but we especially conceive of it in three manners and in three different spheres. In the Divine world
(AZILUTH), which is that of the First Cause, and wherein the whole Eternity of Things in the beginning existed as Unity, to be afterward, during Eternity uttered forth, clothed with form, and the

attributes that constitute them matter, the First Principle is Single and First, and yet not the VERY Illimitable Deity, incomprehensible, undefinable; but Himself in so far as manifested by the Creative
Thought. To compare littleness with infinity, Arkwright, as inventor of the spinningjenny, and not the man Arkwright otherwise and beyond that. All we can know of the Very God is, compared to His
Wholeness, only as an infinitesimal fraction of a unit, compared with an infinity of Units. In the World of Creation, which is that of Second Causes [the Kabalistic World BRIAH], the Autocracy of the First
Principle is complete, but we conceive of it only as the Cause of the Second Causes. Here it is manifested by the Binary, and is the Creative Principle passive. Finally: in the third world, YEZIRAH,
or of Formation, it is revealed in the perfect Form, the Form of Forms, the World, the Supreme Beauty and Excellence, the Created Perfection. Thus the Principle is at once the First, the Second, and the
Third, since it is All in All, the Centre and Cause of all. It is not the genius of Plato that we here admire. We recognize only the exact knowledge of the Initiate.
The great Apostle Saint John did not borrow from the philosophy of Plato the opening of his Gospel.
Plato, on the contrary, drank at the same springs with Saint John and Philo; and John in the opening verses of his paraphrase, states the first principles of a dogma common to many schools, but in
language especially belonging to Bhilo, whom it is evident he had read. The philosophy of Plato, the greatest of human Revealers, could yearn toward the Word made man; the Gospel alone could give him
to the world.
Doubt, in presence of Being and its harmonies; skepticism, in the face of the eternal mathematics and the immutable laws of Life which make the Divinity present and visible everywhere, as the Human is
known and visible by its utterances of word and act, is this not the most foolish of superstitions, and the most inexcusable as well as the most dangerous of all credulities ? Thought, we know, is not a result or
consequence of the organization of matter, of the chemical or other action or reaction of its particles, like effervescence and gaseous explosions. On the contrary, the fact that Thought is manifested and
realized in act human or act divine, proves the existence of an Entity, or Unity, that thinks. And the Universe is the Infinite Utterance of one of an infinite number of Infinite Thoughts, which cannot but
emanate from an Infinite and Thinking Source.
The cause is always equal, at least, to the effect; and matter cannot think, nor could it cause itself, or exist without cause, nor could nothing produce either forces or things; for in void nothingness no Forces
can inhere. Admit a selfexistent Force, and its Intelligence, or an Intelligent cause of it is admitted, and at once GOD Is.
The Hebrew allegory of the Fall of Man, which is but a special variation of a universal legend,
symbolizes one of the grandest and most universal allegories of science.

Moral Evil is Falsehood in actions, as Falsehood is Crime in words. Injustice is the essence of Falsehood; and every false word is an injustice. Injustice is the death of the Moral Being, as Falsehood
is the poison of the Intelligence.
The perception of the Light is the dawn of the Eternal Life, in Being. The Word of God, which creates the Light, seems to be uttered by every Intelligence that can take cognizance of Forms and will look.
"Let the Light BE! The Light, in fact, exists, in its condition of splendor, for those eyes alone that gaze at it; and the Soul, amorous of the spectacle of the beauties of the Universe, and applying its attention
to that luminous writing of the Infinite Book, which is called "The Visible," seems to utter, as God did on the dawn of the first day, that sublime and creative word, "BE! LIGHT!"
It is not beyond the tomb, but in life itself, that we are to seek for the mysteries of death. Salvation or
reprobation begins here below, and the terrestrial world too has its Heaven and its Hell. Always, even here below, virtue is rewarded; always, even here below, vice is polished; and that which makes us
sometimes believe in the impunity of evildoers is that riches, those instruments of good and of evil, seem sometimes to be given them at hazard. But woe to unjust men, when they possess the key of gold !
It opens, for them, only the gate of the tomb and of Hell. All the true Initiates have recognized the usefulness of toil and sorrow. "Sorrow," says a German poet, "is the dog of that unknown shepherd who
guides the flock of men." To learn to suffer, to learn to die, is the discipline of Eternity, the immortal Novitiate.
The allegorical picture of Cebes, in which the Divine Comedy of Dante was sketched in Plato's time,
the description whereof has been preserved for us, and which many painters of the middle age have reproduced by this description, is a monument at once philosophical and magical. It is a most complete
moral synthesis, and at the same time the most audacious demonstration ever given of the Grand Arcanum, of that secret whose revelation would overturn Earth and Heaven. Let no one expect us to
give them its explanation! He who passes behind the veil that hides this mystery, understands that it is in its very nature inexplicable, and that it is death to those who win it by surprise, as well as to him who
reveals it.
This secret is the Royalty of the Sages, the Crown of the Initiate whom we see redescend victorious from the summit of Trials, in the fine allegory of Cebes. The Grand Arcanum makes him master of
gold and the light, which are at bottom the same thing, he has solved the problem of the quadrature of the circle, he directs the perpetual movement, and he possesses the philosophical stone. Here the
Adepts will understand us. There is neither interruption in the toil of nature, nor gap in her work. The Harmonies of Heaven correspond to those of Earth, and the Eternal Life accomplishes its evolutions in
accordance with the same laws as the life of a dog. "God has arranged all things by weight, number, and measure," says the Bible; and this luminous doctrine was also that of Plato.

Humanity has never really had but one religion and one worship. This universal light has had its uncertain mirages, its deceitful reflections, and its shadows; but always, after the nights of Error, we see
it reappear, one and pure like the Sun.
The magnificences of worship are the life of religion, and if Christ wishes poor ministers, His Sovereign Divinity does not wish paltry altars. Some Protestants have not comprehended that worship
is a teaching, and that we must not create in the imagination of the multitude a mean or miserable God. Those oratories that resemble poorlyfurnished offices or inns, and those worthy ministers clad like
notaries or lawyer's clerks, do they not necessarily cause religion to be regarded as a mere puritanic formality, and God as a Justice of the Peace?
We scoff at the Augurs. It is so easy to scoff, and so difficult well to comprehend. Did the Deity leave
the whole world without Light for two score centuries, to illuminate only a little corner of Palestine and a brutal, ignorant, and ungrateful people? Why always calumniate God and the Sanctuary? Were there
never any others than rogues among the priests? Could no honest and sincere men be found among the Hierophants of Ceres or Diana, of Dionusos or Apollo, of Hermes or Mithras? Were these, then, all
deceived, like the rest? Who, then, constantly deceived them, without betraying themselves, during a series of centuries? For the cheats are not immortal ! Arago said, that outside of the pure mathematics,
he who utters the word "impossible," is wanting in prudence and good sense.
The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but the negation of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry.
For the Initiates, this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is
the instrument of Liberty or Free Will. They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, under the mythologic and horned form of the God PAN; thence came the hegoat of the
Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Lightbearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend.
Gold, to the eyes of the Initiates, is Light condensed. They style the sacred numbers of the Kabalah
"golden numbers," and the moral teachings of Pythagoras his "golden verses." For the same reason, a mysterious book of Apuleius, in which an ass figures largely, was called "The Golden Ass."
The Pagans accused the Christians of worshipping an ass, and they did not invent this reproach, but it
came from the Samaritan Jews, who, figuring the data of the Kabalah in regard to the Divinity by Egyptian symbols, also represented the Intelligence by the figure of the Magical Star adored under the
name of Remphan, Science under the emblem of Anubis, whose name they changed to Nibbas, and the vulgar faith or credulity under the figure of Thartac, a god represented with a book, a cloak, and the

head of an ass. According to the Samaritan Doctors, Christianity was the reign of Thartac, blind Faith and vulgar credulity erected into a universal oracle, and preferred to Intelligence and Science.
Synesius, Bishop of Ptolemais, a great Kabalist, but of doubtful orthodoxy, wrote:
"The people will always mock at things easy to be misunderstood; it must needs have impostures."
"A Spirit," he said, "that loves wisdom and contemplates the Trufh close at hand, is forced to disguise
it, to induce the multitudes to accept it. Fictions are necessary to the people, and the Truth becomes deadly to those who are not strong enough to contemplate it in all its brilliance. If the sacerdotal laws
allowed the reservation of judgments and the allegory of words, I would accept the proposed dignity on condition that I might be a philosopher at home, and abroad a narrator of apologues and parables. In
fact, what can there be in common between the vile multitude and sublime wisdom? The truth must be kept secret, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason."
Moral disorders produce physical ugliness, and in some sort realize those frightful faces which tradition
assigns to the demons.
The first Druids were the true children of the Magi, and their initiation came from Egypt and Chaldaea, that is to say, from the pure sources of the primitive Kabalah. They adored the Trinity under the names
of Isis or Hesus, the Supreme Harmony; of Belerl or Bel, which in Assyrian means Lord, a name corresponding to that of ADONAI; and of Camul or Camael, a name that in the Kabalah personifies the
Divine Justice. Below this triangle of Light they supposed a divine reflection, also composed of three personified rays: first, Teutates or Teuth, the same as the Thoth of the Egyptians, the Word, or the
Intelligence formulated; then Force and Beauty, whose names varied like their emblems. Finally, they completed the sacred Septenary by a mysterious image that represented the progress of the dogma and
its future realizations. This was a young girl veiled, holding a child in her arms; and they dedicated this image to "The Virgin who will become a mother;Virgini pariturae".
Hertha or Wertha, the young Isis of Gaul, Queen of Heaven, the Virgin who was to bear a child, held
the spindle of the Fates, filled with wool half white and half black; because she presides over all forms and all symbols, and weaves the garment of the Ideas.
One of the most mysterious pantacles of the Kabalah, contained in the Enchiridion of Leo III.,
represents an equilateral triangle reversed, inscribed in a double circle. On the triangle are written, in such manner as to form the prophetic Tau, the two Hebrew words so often found appended to the
Ineffable Name, and ALOHAYIM, or the Powers, and TSABAOTH, or the starry Armies and their

87/641
guiding spirits; words also which symbolize the Equilibrium of the Forces of Nature and the Harmony of Numbers. To the three sides of the triangle belong the three great Names IAHAVEH, ADONAI, and
AGLA. Above the first is written in Latin, Formatio, above the second Reformatio, and above the third, Transformation. So Creation is ascribed to the FATHER, Redemption or Reformation to the SON, and
Sanctification or Transformation to the HOLY SPIRIT, answering unto the mathematical laws of Action, Reaction, and Equilibrium. IAHAVEH is also, in effect, the Genesis or Formation of dogma, by
the elementary signification of the four letters of the Sacred Tetragram; ADONAI; is the realization of this dogma in the Human Form, in the Visible LORD, who is the Son of God or the perfect Man; and
AGLA (formed of the initials of the four words Ath Gebur Laulaim Adonai) expresses the synthesis of the whole dogma and the totality of the Kabali.stic science, clearly indicating by the hieroglyphics of
which this admirable name is formed the Triple Secret of the Great Work.
Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its
symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from tl1em, and todraw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive
it, or would pervert it. So God Himself incapacitates many men, by colorblindness, to distinguish colors, and leads the masses away from the highest Truth, giving them the power to attain only so much
of it as it is profitable to them to know. Every age has had a religion suited to its capacity.
The Teachers, even of Christianity, are, in general, the most ignorant of the true meaning of that which they teach. There is no book of which so little is known as the Bible. To most who read it, it is as
incomprehensible as the Sohar.
So Masonry jealously conceals its secrets, and intentionally leads conceited interpreters astray. There is no sight under the sun more pitiful and ludicrous at once, than the spectacle of the Prestons and the
Webbs, not to mention the later incarnations of Dullness and Commonplace, undertaking to "explain" the old symbols of Masonry, and adding to and "improving" them, or inventing new ones.
To the Circle inclosing the central point, and itself traced between two parallel lines, a figure purely
Kabalistic, these persons have added the superimposed Bible, and even reared on that the ladder with three or nine rounds, and then given a vapid interpretation of the whole, so profoundly absurd as
actually to excite admiration.

MASONRY is a succession of allegories, the mere vehicles of great lessons in morality and philosophy. You will more fully appreciate its spirit, its object, its purposes, as you advance in the different
Degrees, which you will find to constitute a great, complete, and harmonious system.
If you have been disappointed in the first three Degrees, as you have received them, and if it has seemed to you that the performance has not come up to the promise, that the lessons of morality are not new,
and the scientific instruction is but rudimentary, and the symbols are imperfectly explained, remember that the ceremonies and lessons of those Degrees have been for ages more and more accommodating
themselves, by curtailment and sinking into commonplace, to the often limited memory and capacity of the Master and Instructor, and to the intellect and needs of the Pupil and Initiate; that they have come to
us from an age when symbols were used, not to reveal but to conceal; when the commonest learning was confined to a select few, and the simplest principles of morality seemed newly discovered truths;
and that these antique and simple Degrees now stand like the broken columns of a roofless Druidic temple, in their rude and mutilated greatness; in many parts, also, corrupted by time, and disfigured by
modern additions and absurd interpretations. They are but the entrance to the great Masonic Temple, the triple columns of the portico.
You have taken the first step over its threshold, the first step toward the inner sanctuary and heart of the
temple. You are in the path that leads up the slope of the mountain of Truth; and it depends upon your secrecy, obedience, and fidelity, whether you will advance or remain stationary.
Imagine not that you will become indeed a Mason by learning what is commonly called the "work," or
even by becoming familiar with our traditions. Masonry has a history, a literature, a philosophy. Its allegories and traditions will teach you much; but much is to be sought elsewhere. The streams of
learning that now flow full and broad must be followed to their heads in the springs that well up in the remote past, and you will there find the origin and meaning of Masonry.
A few rudimentary lessons in architecture, a few universally admitted maxims of morality, a few
unimportant traditions, whose real meaning is unknown or misunderstood, will no longer satisfy the earnest inquirer after Masonic truth. Let whoso is content with these, seek to climb no higher. He who
desires to understand the harmonious and beautiful proportions of Freemasonry must read, study, reflect, digest, and discriminate. The true Mason is an ardent seeker after knowledge; and he knows that
both books and the antique symbols of Masonry are vessels which come down to us fullfreighted with the intellectual riches of the Past; and that in the lading of these argosies is much that sheds light on the
history of Masonry, and proves its claim to be acknowledged the benefactor of mankind, born in the very cradle of the race.
Knowledge is the most genuine and real of human treasures; for it is Light, as Ignorance is Darkness. It

is the development of the human soul, and its acquisition the growth of the soul, which at the birth of man knows nothing, and therefore, in one sense, may be said to be nothing. It is the seed, which has in
it the power to grow, to acquire, and by acquiring to be developed, as the seed is developed into the shoot, the plant, the tree. "We need not pause at the common argument that by learning man excelleth
man, in that wherein man excelleth beasts; that by learning man ascendeth to the heavens and their motions, where in body he cannot come, and the like. Let us rather regard the dignity and excellency of
knowledge and learning in that whereunto man's nature doth most aspire, which is immortality or continuance. For to this tendeth generation, and raising of Houses and Families; to this buildings,
foundations, and monuments; to this tendeth the desire of memory, fame, and celebration, and in effect the strength of all other human desires." That our influences shall survive us, and be living forces when
we are in our graves; and no merely that our names shall be remembered; but rather that our works shall be read, our acts spoken of, our names recollected an mentioned when we are dead, as evidences that
those influences live and rule, sway and control some portion of mankind and of the world, this is the aspiration of the human soul. "We see then how far the monuments of genius and learning are more
durable than monuments of power or of the hands. For have not the verses of Homer continued twenty five hundred years or more, without the loss of a syllable or letter, during which time infinite palaces,
temples, castles, cities, have decayed and been demolished? It is no possible to have the true pictures or statues of Cyrus, Alexander Caesar, no, nor of the Kings or great personages of much late years; for the
originals cannot last, and the copies cannot but lose of the life and truth. But the images of men's genius and knowledge remain in books, exempted from the wrong of time, and capable of perpetual
renovation. Neither are they fitly to be called images, because they generate still, and cast their seeds in the minds of others, provoking and causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages; so that if
the invention of the ship was thought so noble, which carrieth riches and commodities from place to place, and consociateth the most remote regions in participation of their fruits, how much more are
letters to be magnified which, as ships, pass through the vast seas of time, and make age so distant to participate of the wisdom, illumination, and inventions, the one of the other."
To learn, to attain knowledge, to be wise, is a necessity for ever truly noble soul; to teach, to
communicate that knowledge, to share that wisdom with others, and not churlishly to lock up his exchequer, and place a sentinel at the door to drive away the needy, is equally an impulse of a noble
nature, and the worthies work of man.
"There was a little city," says the Preacher, the son of David "and few men within it; and there came a great King against it and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. Now there was found in it a
poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. Then said I, wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless, the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his
words are not heard." If it should chance to you, my brother, to do mankind good service, and be rewarded with indifference and forgetfulness only, still be not discouraged, but remember the further
advice of the wise King. "In the morning sow the seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, this or that, or whether both shall be alike good." Sow you the
seed, whoever reaps. Learn, that you may be enabled to do good; and do so because it is right, finding

in the act itself ample reward and recompense.
To attain the truth, and to serve our fellows, our country, and mankind this is the noblest destiny of man. Hereafter and all your life it is to be your object. If you desire to ascend to that destiny, advance! If
you have other and less noble objects, and are contented with a lower flight, halt here ! let others scale the heights, and Masonry fulfill her mission.
If you will advance, gird up your loins for the struggle! For the way is long and toilsome. Pleasure, all
smiles, will beckon you on the one hand, and Indolence will invite you to sleep among the flowers, upon the other. Prepare, by secrecy, obedience, and fidelity, to resist the allurements of both!
Secrecy is indispensable in a Mason of whatever Degree. It is the first and almost the only lesson taught
to the Entered Apprentice. The obligations which we have each assumed toward every Mason that lives, requiring of us the performance of the most serious and onerous duties toward those personally
unknown to us until they demand our aid, duties that must be performed, even at the risk of life, or our solemn oaths be broken and violated, and we be branded as false Masons and faithless men, teach us
how profound a folly it would be to betray our secrets to those who, bound to us by no tie of common obligation, might, by obtaining them, call on us in their extremity, when the urgency of the occasion
should allow us no time for inquiry, and the peremptory mandate of our obligation compel us to do a brother's duty to a base impostor.
The secrets of our brother, when communicated to us, must be sacred, if they be such as the law of our
country warrants us to keep. We are required to keep none other, when the law that we are called on to obey is indeed a law, by having emanated from the only source of power, the People. Edicts which
emanate from the mere arbitrary will of a despotic power, contrary to the law of God or the Great Law of Nature, destructive of the inherent rights of man, violative of the right of free thought, free speech,
free conscience, it is lawful to rebel against and strive to abrogate.
For obedience to the Law does not mean submission to tyranny nor that, by a profligate sacrifice of every noble feeling, we should offer to despotism the homage of adulation. As every new victim falls,
we may lift our voice in still louder flattery. We may fall at the proud feet, we may beg, as a boon, the honour of kissing that bloody hand which has been lifted against the helpless. We may do more: we
may bring the altar and the sacrifice, and implore the God not to ascend too soon to Heaven. This we may do, for this we have the sad remembrance that beings of a human form and soul have done. But
this is all we can do. We can constrain our tongues to be false, our features to bend themselves to the semblance of that passionate adoration which we wish to express, our knees to fall prostrate; but our
heart we cannot constrain. There virtue must still have a voice which is not to be drowned by hymns and acclamations; there the crimes which we laud as virtues, are crimes still, and he whom we have made a

God is the most contemptible of mankind; if, indeed, we do not feel, perhaps, that we are ourselves still more contemptible.
But that law which is the fair expression of the will and judgment of the people, is the enactment of the
whole and of every individual. Consistent with the law of God and the great law of nature, consistent with pure and abstract right as tempered by necessity and the general interest, as contradistinguished
from the private interest of individuals, it is obligatory upon all, because it is the work of all, the will of all, the solemn judgment of all, from which there is no appeal.
In this Degree, my brother, you are especially to learn the duty of obedience to that law. There is one
true and original law, conformable to reason and to nature, diffused over all, invariable, eternal, which calls to the fulfillment of duty and to abstinence from injustice, and calls with that irresistible voice
which is felt l in all its authority wherever it is heard. This law cannot be abrogated or diminished, or its sanctions affected, by any law of man. A whole senate, a whole people, cannot dissent from its
paramount obligation. It requires no commentator to render it distinctly intelligible: nor is it one thing at Rome, another at Athens; one thing now, and another in the ages to come; but in all times and in all
nations, it is, and has been, and will be, one and everlasting; one as that God, its great Author and Promulgator, who is the Common Sovereign of all mankind, is Himself One. No man can disobey it
without flying, as it were, from his own bosom, and repudiating his nature; and in this very act he will inflict on himself the severest of retributions, even though he escape what is regarded as punishment.
It is our duty to obey the laws of our country, and to be careful that prejudice or passion, fancy or
affection, error and illusion, be not mistaken for conscience. Nothing is more usual than to pretend conscience in all the actions of man which are public and cannot be concealed. The disobedient refuse
to submit to the laws, and they also in many cases pretend conscience; and so disobedience and rebellion become conscience, in which there is neither knowledge nor revelation, nor truth nor charity,
nor reason nor religion. Conscience is tied to laws. Right or sure conscience is right reason reduced to practice, and conducting moral actions, while perverse conscience is seated in the fancy or affections a
heap of irregular principles and irregular defects and is the same in conscience as deformity is in the body, or peevishness in the affections.
It is not enough that the conscience be taught by nature; but it must be taught by God, conducted by
reason, made operative by discourse, assisted by choice, instructed by laws and sober principles; and then it is right, and it may be sure. All the general measures of justice, are the laws of God, and
therefore they constitute the general rules of government for the conscience; but necessity also hath a large voice in the arrangement of human affairs, and the disposal of human relations, and the
dispositions of human laws; and these general measures, like a great river into little streams, are deduced into little rivulets and particularities, by the laws and customs, by the sentences and
agreements of men, and by the absolute despotism of necessity, that will not allow perfect and abstract

justice and equity to be the sole rule of civil government in an imperfect world; and that must needs be law which is for the greatest good of the greatest number.
When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it. It is better thou shouldest not vow than thou
shouldest vow and not pay. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in Heaven, and thou art upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. Weigh well
what it is you promise; but once the promise and pledge are given remember that he who is false to his obligation will be false to his family, his friends, his country, and his God.
Fides servailda est: Faith plighted is ever to be kept, was a maxim and an axiom even among pagans.
The virtuous Roman said, either let not that which seems expedient be base, or if it be base, let it not seem expedient. What is there which that socalled expediency can bring, so valuable as that which it
takes away, if it deprives you of the name of a good man and robs you of your integrity and honour? In all ages, he who violates his plighted word has been held unspeakably base. The word of a Mason, like
the word of a knight in the times of chivalry, once given must be sacred; and the judgment of his brothers, upon him who violates his pledge, should be stern as the judgments of the Roman Censors
against him who violated his oath. Good faith is revered among Masons as it was among the Romans, who placed its statue in the capitol, next to that of Jupiter Maximus Optimus; and we, like them, hold
that calamity should always be chosen rather than baseness; and with the knights of old, that one should always die rather than be dishonoured. Be faithful, therefore, to the promises you make, to the pledges
you give, and to the vows that you assume, since to break either is base and dishonourable.
Be faithful to your family, and perform all the duties of a good father, a good son, a good husband, and a good brother.
Be faithful to your friends; for true friendship is of a nature not only to survive through all the
vicissitudes of life, but to continue through an endless duration; not only to stand the shock of conflicting opinions, and the roar of a revolution that shakes the world, but to last when the heavens are
no more, and to spring fresh from the ruins of the universe.
Be faithful to your country, and prefer its dignity and honour to any degree of popularity and honour for yourself; consulting its interest rather than your own, and rather than the pleasure and gratification of
the people, which are often at variance with their welfare.
Be faithful to Masonry, which is to be faithful to the best interests of mankind. Labour, by precept and example, to elevate the standard of Masonic character, to enlarge its sphere of influence, to popularize
its teachings, and to make all men know it for the Great Apostle of Peace, Harmony, and Goodwill on earth among men; of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.

Masonry is useful to all men: to the learned, because it affords them the opportunity of exercising their
talents upon subjects eminently worthy of their attention; to the illiterate, because it offers them important instruction; to the young, because it presents them with salutary precepts and good examples,
and accustoms them to reflect on the proper mode of living; to the man of the world, whom it furnishes with noble and useful recreation; to the traveller, whom it enables to find friends and brothers in
countries where else he would be isolated and solitary; to the worthy man in misfortune, to whom it gives assistance; to the afflicted, on whom it lavishes consolation; to the charitable man, whom it
enables to do more good, by uniting with those who are charitable like himself; and to all who have souls capable of appreciating its importance, and of enjoying the charms of a friendship founded on the
same principles of religion, morality, and philanthropy.
A Freemason, therefore, should be a man of honour and of conscience, preferring his duty to everything beside, even to his life; independent in his opinions, and of good morals, submissive to the laws,
devoted to humanity, to his country, to his family; kind and indulgent to his brethren, friend of all virtuous men, and ready to assist his fellows by all means in his power.
Thus will you be faithful to yourself, to your fellows, and to God, and thus will you do honour to the
name and rank of SECRET MASTER; which, like other Masonic honours, degrades if it is not deserved.
V. PERFECT MASTER
The Master Khurum was an industrious and an honest man. What he was employed to do he did diligently, and he did it well and faithfully. He received no wages that were not his due. Industry and
honesty are the virtues peculiarly inculcated in this Degree. They are common and homely virtues; but not for that beneath our notice. As the bees do not love or respect the drones, so Masonry neither loves
nor respects the idle and those who live by their wits; and least of all those parasitic acari that live upon themselves. For those who are indolent are likely to become dissipated and vicious; and perfect honesty,
which ought to be the common qualification of all, is more rare than diamonds. To do earnestly and steadily, and to do faithfully and honestly that which we have to doperhaps this wants but little, when
looked at from every point of view, of including the whole body of the moral law; and even in their commonest and homeliest application, these virtues belong to the character of a Perfect Master.
Idleness is the burial of a living man. For an idle person is so useless to any purposes of God and man,
that he is like one who is dead, unconcerned in the changes and necessities of the world; and he only lives to spend his time, and eat the fruits of the earth. Like a vermin or a wolf, when his time comes, he
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



94/641
dies and perishes, and in the meantime is nought. He neither ploughs nor carries burdens: all that he does is either unprofitable or mischievous.
It is a vast work that any man may do, if he never be idle: and it is a huge way that a man may go in
virtue, if he never go out of his way by a vicious habit or a great crime and he who perpetually reads good books, if his parts be answerable, will have a huge stock of knowledge.
St. Ambrose, and from his example, St. Augustine, divided every day into these tertias of employment:
eight hours they spent in the necessities of nature and recreation: eight hours in charity, in doing assistance to others, dispatching their business, reconciling their enmities, reproving their vices,
correcting their errors, instructing their ignorance, and in transacting the affairs of their dioceses; and the other eight hours they spent in study and prayer.
We think, at the age of twenty, that life is much too long for that which we have to learn and do; and
that there is an almost fabulous distance between our age and that of our grandfather. But when, at the age of sixty, if we are fortunate enough to reach it, or unfortunate enough, as the case may be, and
according as we have profitably invested or wasted our time, we halt, and look back along the way we have come, and cast up and endeavour to balance our accounts with time and opportunity, we find that
we have made life much too short, and thrown away a huge portion of our time. Then we, in our mind, deduct from the sum total of our years the hours that we have needlessly passed in sleep; the working
hours each day, during which the surface of the mind's sluggish pool has not been stirred or ruffied by a single thought; the days that we have gladly got rid of, to attain some real or fancied object that lay
beyond, in the way between us and which stood irksomely the intervening days; the hours worse than wasted in follies and dissipation, or misspent in useless and unprofitable studies; and we acknowledge,
with a sigh, that we could have learned and done, in half a score of years well spent, more than we have done in all our forty years of manhood.
To learn and to do this is the soul's work here below. The soul grows as truly as an oak grows. As the
tree takes the carbon of the air, the dew, the rain, and the light, and the food that the earth supplies to its roots, and by its mysterious chemistry transmutes them into sap and fibre, into wood and leaf, and
flower and fruit, and colour and perfume, so the soul imbibes knowledge and by a divine alchemy changes what it learns into its own substance, and grows from within outwardly with an inherent force
and power like those that lie hidden in the grain of wheat.
The soul hath its senses, like the body, that may be cultivated, enlarged, refined, as itself grows in stature and proportion; and he who cannot appreciate a fine painting or statue, a noble poem, a sweet
harmony, a heroic thought, or a disinterested action, or to whom the wisdom of philosophy is but foolishness and babble, and the loftiest truths of less importance than the price of stocks or cotton, or

95/641
the elevation of baseness to once, merely lives on the level of commonplace, and fitly prides himself upon that inferiority of the soul's senses, which is the inferiority and imperfect development of the soul
itself.
To sleep little, and to study much; to say little, and to hear and think much; to learn, that we may be able to do, and then to do, earnestly and vigorously, whatever may be required of us by duty, and by the
good of our fellows, our country, and mankind, these are the duties of every Mason who desires to imitate the Master Khurum.
The duty of a Mason as an honest man is plain and easy. It requires of us honesty in contracts, sincerity
in arming, simplicity in bargaining, and faithfulness in performing. Lie not at all, neither in a little thing nor in a great, neither in the substance nor in the circumstance, neither in word nor deed: that is,
pretend not what is false; cover not what is true; and let the measure of your affirmation or denial be the understanding of your contractor; for he who deceives the buyer or the seller by speaking what is true,
in a sense not intended or understood by the other, is a liar and a thief. A Perfect Master must avoid that which deceives, equally with that which is false.
Let your prices be according to that measure of good and evil which is established in the fame and
common accounts of the wisest and most merciful men, skilled in that manufacture or commodity; and the gain such, which, without scandal, is allowed to persons in all the same circumstances.
In intercourse with others, do not do all which thou mayest lawfully do; but keep something within thy
power; and, because there is a latitude of gain in buying and selling, take not thou the utmost penny that is lawful, or which thou thinkest so; for although it be lawful, yet it is not safe; and he who gains all that
he can gain lawfully, this year, will possibly be tempted, next year, to gain something unlawfully.
Let no man, for his own poverty, become more oppressing and cruel in his bargain; but quietly, modestly, diligently, and patiently recommend his estate to God, and follow his interest, and leave the
success to Him.
Detain not the wages of the hireling; for every degree of detention of it beyond the time, is injustice and uncharitableness, and grinds his face till tears and blood come out; but pay him exactly according to
covenant, or according to his needs.
Religiously keep all promises and covenants, though made to your disadvantage, though afterward you perceive you might have done better; and let not any precedent act of yours be altered by any after
accident. Let nothing make you break your promise, unless it be unlawful or impossible; that is, either
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



96/641
out of your nature or out of your civil power, yourself being under the power of another; or that it be intolerably inconvenient to yourself, and of no advantage to another; or that you have leave expressed or
reasonably presumed.
Let no man take wages or fees for a work that he cannot do, or cannot with probability undertake; or in some sense profitably, and with ease, or with advantage manage. Let no man appropriate to his own
use, what God, by a special mercy, or the Republic, hath made common; for that is against both Justice and Charity.
That any man should be the worse for us, and for our direct act, and by our intention, is against the rule
of equity, of justice, and of charity. We then do not that to others, which we would have done to ourselves; for we grow richer upon the ruins of their fortune.
It is not honest to receive anything from another without returning him an equivalent therefor. The
gamester who wins the money of another is dishonest. There should be no such thing as bets and gaming among Masons: for no honest man should desire that for nothing which belongs to another. The
merchant who sells an inferior article for a sound price, the speculator who makes the distresses and needs of others fill his exchequer are neither fair nor honest, but base, ignoble, unfit for immortality.
It should be the earnest desire of every Perfect Master so to live and deal and act, that when it comes to
him to die, he may be able to say, and his conscience to adjudge, that no man on earth is poorer, because he is richer; that what he hath he has honestly earned, and no man can go before God, and
claim that by the rules of equity administered in His great chancery, this house in which we die, this land we devise to our heirs this money that enriches those who survive to bear our name, is his and not
ours, and we in that forum are only his trustees. For it is most certain that God is just, and will sternly enforce every such trust; and that to all whom we despoil, to all whom we defraud, to all from whom
we take or win anything whatever, without fair consideration and equivalent, He will decree a full and adequate compensation.
Be careful, then, that thou receive no wages, here or elsewhere, that are not thy due ! For if thou doest,
thou wrongst some one, by taking that which in God's chancery belongs to him; and whether that which thou takest thus be wealth, or rank, or influence, or reputation or affection, thou wilt surely be held to
make full satisfaction.

You are especially taught in this Degree to be zealous and faithful; to be disinterested and benevolent; and to act the peacemaker, in case of dissensions, disputes, and quarrels among the brethren.
Duty is the moral magnetism which controls and guides the true Mason's course over the tumultuous
seas of life. Whether the stars of honour, reputation, and reward do or do not shine, in the light of day or in the darkness of the night of trouble and adversity, in calm or storm, that unerring magnet still shows
him the true course to steer, and indicates with certainty whereaway lies the port which not to reach involves shipwreck and dishonour. He follows its silent bidding, as the mariner, when land is for many
days not in sight, and the ocean without path or landmark spreads out all around him, follows the bidding of the needle, never doubting that it points truly to the north. To perform that duty, whether the
performance be rewarded or unrewarded, is his sole care. And it doth not matter, though of this performance there may be no witnesses, and though what he does will be forever unknown to all
mankind.
A little consideration will teach us that Fame has other limits than mountains and oceans; and that he who places happiness in the frequent repetition of his name, may spend his life in propagating it,
without any danger of weeping for new worlds, or necessity of passing the Atlantic sea.
If, therefore, he who imagines the world to be filled with his actions and praises, shall subduct from the number of his encomiasts all those who are placed below the flight of fame, and who hear in the valley
of life no voice but that of necessity; all those who imagine themselves too important to regard him, and consider the mention of his name as a usurpation of their time; all who are too much or too little
pleased with themselves to attend to anything external; all who are attracted by pleasure, or chained down by pain to unvaried ideas; all who are withheld from attending his triumph by different pursuits;
and all who slumber in universal negligence; he will find his renown straitened by nearer bounds than the rocks of Caucasus; and perceive that no man can be venerable or formidable, but to a small part of
his fellowcreatures. And therefore, that we may not languish in our endeavors after excellence, it is necessary that, as Africanus counsels his descendants, we raise our eyes to higher prospects, and
contemplate our future and eternal state, without giving up our hearts to the praise of crowds, or fixing our hopes on such rewards as human power can bestow.
We are not born for ourselves alone; and our country claims her share, and our friends their share of us.
As all that the earth produces is created for the use of man, so men are created for the sake of men, that they may mutually do good to one another. In this we ought to take nature for our guide, and throw into
the public stock the ounces of general utility, by a reciprocation of duties; sometimes by receiving, sometimes by giving, and sometimes to cement human society by arts, by industry, and by our
resources.

Suffer others to be praised in thy presence, and entertain their good and glory with delight; but at no hand disparage them, or lessen the report, or make an objection; and think not the advancement of thy
brother is a lessening of thy worth. Upbraid no man's weakness to him to discomfit him, neither report it to disparage him, neither delight to remember it to lessen him, or to set thyself above him; nor ever
praise thyself or dispraise any man else, unless some sufficient worthy end do hallow it.
Remember that we usually disparage others upon slight grounds and little instances; and if a man be highly recommended, we think him sufficiently lessened, if we can but charge one sin of folly or
inferiority in his account. We should either be more severe to ourselves, or less so to others, and consider that whatsoever good any one can think or say of us, we can tell him of many unworthy and
foolish and perhaps worse actions of ours, any one of which, done by another, would be enough, with us, to destroy his reputation.
If we think the people wise and sagacious, and just and appreciative, when they praise and make idols
of us, let us not call them unlearned and ignorant, and ill and stupid judges, when our neighbour is cried up by public fame and popular noises.
Every man hath in his own life sins enough, in his own mind trouble enough, in his own fortunes evil
enough, and in performance of his offices failings more than enough, to entertain his own inquiry; so that curiosity after the affairs of others can not be without envy and an ill mind. The generous man will
be solicitous and inquisitive into the beauty and order of a wellgoverned family, and after the virtues of an excellent person; but anything for which men keep locks and bars, or that blushes to see the light, or
that is either shameful in manner or private in nature, this thing will not be his care and business.
It should be objection sufficient to exclude any man from the society of Masons, that he is not disinterested and generous, both in his acts, and in his opinions of men, and his constructions of their
conduct. He who is selfish and grasping, or censorious and ungenerous, will not long remain within the strict limits of honesty and truth, but will shortly commit injustice. He who loves himself too much
must needs love others too little; and he who habitually gives harsh judgment will not long delay to give unjust judgment.
The generous man is not careful to return no more than he receives; but prefers that the balances upon
the ledgers of benefits shall be in his favour. He who hath received pay in full for all the benefits and favours that he has conferred, is like a spendthrift who has consumed his whole estate, and laments over
an empty exchequer. He who requites my favours with ingratitude adds to, instead of diminishing, my wealth; and he who cannot return a favour is equally poor, whether his inability arises from poverty of
spirit, sordidness of soul, or pecuniary indigence.

If he is wealthy who hath large sums invested, and the mass of whose fortune consists in obligations that bind other men to pay him money, he is still more so to whom many owe large returns of
kindnesses and favours. Beyond a moderate sum each year, the wealthy man merely invests his means: and that which he never uses is still like favours unreturned and kindnesses unreciprocated, an actual
and real portion of his fortune.
Generosity and a liberal spirit make men to be humane and genial, openhearted, frank, and sincere, earnest to do good, easy and contented, and wellwishers of mankind. They protect the feeble against
the strong, and the defenceless against rapacity and craft. They succour and comfort the poor, and are the guardians, under God, of his innocent and helpless wards. They value friends more than riches or
fame, and gratitude more than money or power. They are noble by God's patent, and their escutcheons and quarterings are to be found in heaven's great book of heraldry. Nor can any man any more be a
Mason than he can be a gentleman, unless he is generous, liberal, and disinterested. To be liberal, but only of that which is our own; to be generous, but only when we have first been just; to give, when to
give deprives us of a luxury or a comfort, this is Masonry indeed.
He who is worldly, covetous, or sensual must change before he can be a good Mason. If we are governed by inclination and not by duty; if we are unkind, severe, censorious, or injurious, in the
relations or intercourse of life; if we are unfaithful parents or undutiful children; if we are harsh masters or faithless servants; if we are treacherous friends or bad neighbours or bitter competitors or corrupt
unprincipled politicians or overreaching dealers in business, we are wandering at a great distance from the true Masonic light.
Masons must be kind and affectionate one to another. Frequenting the same temples, kneeling at the
same altars, they should feel that respect and that kindness for each other, which their common relation and common approach to one God should inspire. There needs to be much more of the spirit of the
ancient fellowship among us; more tenderness for each other's faults, more forgiveness, more solicitude for each other's improvement and good fortune; somewhat of brotherly feeling, that it be not shame to
use the word "brother."
Nothing should be allowed to interfere with that kindness and affection: neither the spirit of business, absorbing, eager, and overreaching, ungenerous and hard in its dealings, keen and bitter in its
competitions, low and sordid in its purposes; nor that of ambition, selfish, mercenary, restless, circumventing, living only in the opinion of others, envious of the good fortune of others, miserably
vain of its own success, unjust, unscrupulous, and slanderous.
He that does me a favour, hath bound me to make him a return of thankfulness. The obligation comes not by covenant, nor by his own express intention; but by the nature of the thing; and is a duty springing

100/641
up within the spirit of the obliged person, to whom it is more natural to love his friend, and to do good for good, than to return evil for evil; because a man may forgive an injury, but he must never forget a
good turn. He that refuses to do good to them whom he is bound to love, or to love that which did him good, is unnatural and monstrous in his affections, and thinks all the world born to minister to him;
with a greediness worse than that of the sea, which, although it receives all rivers into itself, yet it furnishes the clouds and springs with a return of all they need. Our duty to those who are our
benefactors is, to esteem and love their persons, to make them proportionable returns of service, or duty, or profit, according as we can, or as they need, or as opportunity presents itself; and according to
the greatness of their kindnesses.
The generous man cannot but regret to see dissensions and disputes among his brethren. Only the base and ungenerous delight in discord. It is the poorest occupation of humanity to labour to make men think
worse of each other, as the press, and too commonly the pulpit, changing places with the hustings and the tribune, do. The duty of the Mason is to endeavour to make man think better of his neighbour; to
quiet, instead of aggravating difficulties; to bring together those who are severed or estranged; to keep friends from becoming foes, and to persuade foes to become friends. To do this, he must needs control
his own passions, and be not rash and hasty, nor swift to take offence, nor easy to be angered.
For anger is a professed enemy to counsel. It is a direct storm, in which no man can be heard to speak or call from without; for if you counsel gently, you are disregarded; if you urge it and be vehement, you
provoke it more. It is neither manly nor ingenuous. It makes marriage to be a necessary and unavoidable trouble; friendships and societies and familiarities, to be intolerable. It multiplies the evils of
drunkenness, and makes the levities of wine to run into madness. It makes innocent jesting to be the beginning of tragedies. It turns friendship into hatred; it makes a man lose himself, and his reason and
his argument, in disputation. It turns the desires of knowledge into an itch of wrangling. It adds insolency to power. It turns justice into cruelty, and judgment into oppression. It changes discipline into
tediousness and hatred of liberal institution. It makes a prosperous man to be envied, and the unfortunate to be unpitied.
See, therefore, that first controlling your own temper, and governing your own passions, you fit yourself
to keep peace and harmony among other men, and especially the brethren. Above all remember that Masonry is the realm of peace, and that "among Masons there must be no dissension, but only that
noble emulation., which can best work and best agree." Wherever there is strife and hatred among the brethren, there is no Masonry; for Masonry is Peace, and Brotherly Love, and Concord.
Masonry is the great Peace Society of the world. Wherever it exists, it struggles to prevent international
difficulties and disputes; and to bind Republics, Kingdoms, and Empires together in one great band of peace and amity. It would not so often struggle in vain, if Masons knew their power and valued their
oaths.

Who can sum up the horrors and woes accumulated in a single war? Masonry is not dazzled with all its
pomp and circumstance, all its glitter and glory. War comes with its bloody hand into our very dwellings. It takes from ten thousand homes those who lived there in peace and comfort, held by the
tender ties of family and kindred. It drags them away, to die untended, of fever or exposure, in infectious climes; or to be hacked, torn, and mangled in the fierce fight; to fall on the gory field, to rise
no more, or to be borne away, in awful agony, to noisome and horrid hospitals. The groans of the battle field are echoed in sighs of bereavement from thousands of desolated hearths. There is a skeleton in
every house, a vacant chair at every table. Returning, the soldier brings worse sorrow to his home, by the infection which he has caught, of campvices. The country is demoralized. The national mind is
brought down, from the noble interchange of kind offices with another people, to wrath and revenge, and base pride, and the habit of measuring brute strength against brute strength, in battle. Treasures are
expended, that would suffice to build ten thousand churches, hospitals, and universities, or rib and tie together a continent with rails of iron. If that treasure were sunk in the sea, it would be calamity
enough; but it is put to worse use; for it is expended in cutting into the veins and arteries of human life, until the earth is deluged with a sea of blood.
Such are the lessons of this Degree. You have vowed to make them the rule, the law, and the guide of
your life and conduct. If you do so, you will be entitled, because fitted, to advance in Masonry. If you do not, you have already gone too far.
VII. PROVOST AND JUDGE
The lesson which this Degree inculcates is JUSTICE, in decision and judgment, and in our intercourse and dealing with other men.
In a country where trial by jury is known, every intelligent man is liable to be called on to act as a
judge, either of fact alone, or of fact and law mingled; and to assume the heavy responsibilities which belong to that character.
Those who are invested with the power of judgment should judge the causes of all persons uprightly
and impartially, without any personal consideration of the power of the mighty, or the bribe of the rich, or the needs of the poor. That is the cardinal rule, which no one will dispute; though many fail to
observe it. But they must do more. They must divest themselves of prejudice and preconception. They must hear patiently, remember accurately, and weigh carefully the facts and the arguments offered
before them. They must not leap hastily to conclusions, nor form opinions before they have heard all. They must not presume crime or fraud. They must neither be ruled by stubborn pride of opinion, nor be

102/641
too facile and yielding to the views and arguments of others. In deducing the motive from the proven act, they must not assign to the act either the best or the worst motives, but those which they would
think it just and fair for the world to assign to it, if they thmselves had done it; nor must they endeavour to make many little circumstances, that weigh nothing separately, weigh much together, to prove their
own acuteness and sagacity. These are sound rules for every juror, also, to observe.
In our intercourse with others, there are two kinds of injustice: the first, of those who offer an injury; the second, of those who have it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it is offered, and
yet do it not. So active injustice may be done in two ways by force and by fraud, of which force is lion like, and aud foxlike, both utterly repugnant to social duty, but fraud the more detestable.
Every wrong done by one man to another, whether it affect his person, his property, his happiness, or
his reputation, is an offense against the law of justice. The field of this Degree is therefore a wide and vast one; and Masonry seeks for the most impressive mode of enforcing the law of justice, and the most
effectual means of preventing wrong and injustice.
To this end it teaches this great and momentous truth: that wrong and injustice once done cannot be undone; but are eternal in their consequences; once committed, are numbered with the irrevocable Past;
that the wrong that is done contains its own retributive penalty as surely and as naturally as the acorn contains the oak. Its consequences are its punishment; it needs no other, and can have no heavier; they
are involved in its commission, and cannot be separated from it. A wrong done to another is an injury done to our own Nature, an offence against our own souls, a disfiguring of the image of the Beautiful
and Good. Punishment is not the execution of a sentence, but the occurrence of an effect. It is ordained to follow guilt, not by the decree of God as a judge, but by a law enacted by Him as the Creator and
Legislator of the Universe. It is not an arbitrary and artificial annexation, but an ordinary and logical consequence; and therefore must be borne by the wrongdoer, and through him may flow on to others.
It is the decision of the infinite justice of God, in the form of law.
There can be no interference with, or remittance of, or protection from, the natural effects of our wrongful acts. God will not interpose between the cause and its consequence; and in that sense there
can be no forgiveness of sins. The act which has debased our soul may be repented of, may be turned from; but the injury is done. The debasement may be redeemed by afterefforts, the stain obliterated by
bitterer struggles and severer sufferings; but the efforts and the endurance which might have raised the soul to the loftiest heights are now exhausted in merely regaining what it has lost. There must always be
a wide difference between him who only ceases to do evil, and him who has always done well.
He will certainly be a far more scrupulous watcher over his conduct, and far more careful of his deeds, who believes that those deeds will inevitably bear their natural consequences, exempt from after

103/641
intervention, than he who believes that penitence and pardon will at any time unlink the chain of sequences. Surely we shall do less wrong and injustice, if the conviction is fixed and embedded in our
souls that everything done is done irrevocably, that even the Omnipotence of God cannot uncommit a deed, cannot make that undone which has been done; that every act of ours must bear its allotted fruit,
according to the everlasting laws, must remain forever ineffaceably inscribed on the tablets of Universal Nature.
If you have wronged another, you may grieve, repent, and resolutely determine against any such
weakness in future. You may, so far as it is possible, make reparation. It is well. The injured party may forgive you, according to the meaning of human language; but the deed is done; and all the powers of
Nature, were they to conspire in your behalf, could not make it undone; the consequences to the body, the consequences to the soul, though no man may perceive them, are there, are written in the annals of
the Past, and must reverberate throughout all time.
Repentance for a wrong done, bears, like every other act, its own fruit, the fruit of purifying the heart and amending the Future, but not of effacing the Past. The commission of the wrong is an irrevocable
act; but it does not incapacitate the soul to do right for the future. Its consequences cannot be expunged; but its course need not be pursued. Wrong and evil perpetrated, though ineffaceable, call for no despair,
but for efforts more energetic than before. Repentance is still as valid as ever; but it is valid to secure the Future, not to obliterate the Past.
Even the pulsations of the air, once set in motion by the human voice, cease not to exist with the sounds
to which they gave rise. Their quicklyattenuated force soon becomes inaudible to human ears. But the waves of air thus raised perambulate the surface of earth and ocean, and in less than twenty hours,
every atom of the atmosphere takes up the altered movement due to that infinitesimal portion of primitive motion which has been conveyed to it through countless channels, and which must continue to
influence its path throughout its future existence. The air is one vast library, on whose pages is forever written all that man has ever said or even whispered. There, in their mutable, but unerring characters,
mixed with the earliest, as well as the latest signs of mortality, stand forever recorded, vows unredeemed, promises unfulfilled; perpetuating, in the movements of each particle, all in unison, the
testimony of man's changeful will. God reads that book, though we cannot.
So earth, air, and ocean are the eternal witnesses of the acts that we have done. No motion impressed by natural causes or by human agency is ever obliterated. The track of every keel which has ever disturbed
the surface of the ocean remains forever registered in the future movements of all succeeding particles which may occupy its place. Every criminal is by the laws of the Almighty irrevocably chained to the
testimony of his crime; for every atom of his mortal frame, through whatever changes its particles may migrate, will still retain, adhering to it through every combination, some movement derived from that
very muscular effort by which the crime itself was perpetrated.

What if our faculties should be so enhanced in a future life as to enable us to perceive and trace the
ineffaceable consequences of our idle words and evil deeds, and render our remorse and grief as eternal as those consequences themselves? No more fearful punishment to a superior intelligence can be
conceived, than to see still in action, with the consciousness that it must continue in action forever, a cause of wrong put in motion by itself ages before.
Masonry, by its teachings, endeavours to restrain men from the commission of injustice and acts of
wrong and outrage. Though it does not endeavour to usurp the place of religion, still its code of morals proceeds upon other principles than the municipal law; and it condemns and punishes offences which
neither that law punishes nor public opinion condemns. In the Masonic law, to cheat and overreach in trade, at the bar, in politics, are deemed no more venial than theft; nor a deliberate lie than perjury; nor
slander than robbery; nor seduction than murder.
Especially it condemns those wrongs of which the doer induces another to partake. He may repent; he may, after agonizing struggles, regain the path of virtue; his spirit may reachieve its purity through
much anguish, after many strifes; but the weaker fellowcreature whom he led astray, whom he made a sharer in his guilt, but whom he cannot make a sharer in his repentance and amendment, whose
downward course (the first step of which he taught) he cannot check, but is compelled to witness, what forgiveness of sins can avail him there? There is his perpetual, his inevitable punishment, which no
repentance can alleviate, and no mercy can remit.
Let us be just, also, in judging of other men's motives. We know but little of the real merits or demerits of any fellow creature. We can rarely say with certainty that this man is more guilty than that, or even
that this man is very good or very wicked. Often the basest men leave behind them excellent reputations. There is scarcely one of us who has not, at some time in his life, been on the edge of the
commission of a crime. Every one of us can look back, and shuddering see the time when our feet stood upon the slippery crags that overhung the abyss of guilt; and when, if temptation had been a little more
urgent, or a little longer continued, if penury had pressed us a little harder, or a little more wine had further disturbed our intellect, dethroned our judgment, and aroused our passions, our feet would have
slipped, and we should have fallen, never to rise again.
We may be able to say "This man has lied, has pilfered, has forged, has embezzled moneys intrusted to him; and that man has gone through life with clean hands." But we cannot say that the former has not
struggled long, though unsuccessfully, against temptations under which the second would have succumbed without an effort. We can say which has the cleanest hands before man; but not which has
the cleanest soul before God. We may be able to say, this man has committed adultery, and that man has been ever chaste; but we cannot tell but that the innocence of one may have been due to the coldness of
his heart, to the absence of a motive, to the presence of a fear, to the slight degree of the temptation; nor

but that the fall of the other may have been preceded by the most vehement selfcontest, caused by the most overmastering frenzy, and atoned for by the most hallowing repentance. Generosity as well as
niggardliness may be a mere yielding to native temperament; and in the eye of Heaven, a long life of beneficence in one man may have cost less effort, and may indicate less virtue and less sacrifice of
interest, than a few rare hidden acts of kindness wrung by duty out of the reluctant and unsympathizing nature of the other. There may be more real merit, more selfsacrificing effort, more of the noblest
elements of moral grandeur, in a life of failure, sin, and shame, than in a career, to our eyes, of stainless integrity.
When we condemn or pity the fallen, how do we know that, tempted like him, we should not have fallen
like him, as soon, and perhaps with less resistance? How can we know what we should do if we were out of employment, famine crouching, gaunt, and hungry, on our fireless hearth, and our children
wailing for bread? We fall not because we are not enough tempted! He that hath fallen may be at heart as honest as we. How do we know that our daughter, sister, wife, could resist the abandonment, the
desolation, the distress, the temptation, that sacrificed the virtue of their poor abandoned sister of shame? Perhaps they also have not fallen, because they have not been sorely tempted! Wisely are we
directed to pray that we may not be exposed to temptation.
Human justice must be ever uncertain. How many judicial murders have been committed through ignorance of the phenomena of insanity! How many men hung for murder who were no more murderers
at heart than the jury that tried and the judge that sentenced them! It may well be doubted whether the administration of human laws, in every country, is not one gigantic mass of injustice and wrong. God
seeth not as man seeth; and the most abandoned criminal, black as he is before the world, may yet have continued to keep some little light burning in a corner of his soul, which would long since have gone
out in that of those who walk proudly in the sunshine of immaculate fame, if they had been tried and tempted like the poor outcast.
We do not know even the outside life of men. We are not competent to pronounce even on their deeds.
We do not know half the acts of wickedness or virtue, even of our most immediate fellows. We cannot say, with certainty, even of our nearest friend, that he has not committed a particular sin, and broken a
particular commandment. Let each man ask his own heart! Of how many of our best and of our worst acts and qualities are our most intimate associates utterly unconscious! How many virtues does not the
world give us credit for, that we do not possess; or vices condemn us for, of which we are not the slaves! It is but a small portion of our evil deeds and thoughts that ever comes to light; and of our few
redeeming goodnesses, the largest portion is known to God alone.
We shall, therefore, be just in judging of other men, only when we are charitable; and we should assume the prerogative of judging others only when the duty is forced upon us; since we are so almost certain to
err, and the consequences of error are so serious. No man need covet the office of judge; for in

assuming it he assumes the gravest and most oppressive responsibility. Yet you have assumed it; we all assume it; for man is ever ready to judge, and ever ready to condemn his neighbour, while upon the
same state of case he acquits himself See, therefore, that you exercise your once cautiously and charitably, lest, in passing judgment upon the criminal, you commit a greater wrong than that for which
you condemn him, and the consequences of which must be eternal.
The faults and crimes and follies of other men are not unimportant to us; but form a part of our moral discipline. War and bloodshed at a distance, and frauds which do not affect our pecuniary interest, yet
touch us in our feelings, and concern our moral welfare. They have much to do with all thoughtful hearts. The public eye may look unconcernedly on the miserable victim of vice, and that shattered
wreck of a man may move the multitude to laughter or to scorn. But to the Mason, it is the form of sacred humanity that is before him; it is an erring fellowbeing; a desolate, forlorn, forsaken soul; and
his thoughts, enfolding the poor wretch, will be far deeper than those of indifference, ridicule, or contempt. All human offences, the whole system of dishonesty, evasion, circumventing, forbidden
indulgence, and intriguing ambition, in which men are struggling with each other, will be looked upon by a thoughtful Mason, not merely as a scene of mean toils and strifes, but as the solemn conflicts of
immortal minds, for ends vast and momentous as their own being. It is a sad and unworthy strife, and may well be viewed with indignation; but that indignation must melt into pity. For the stakes for which
these gamesters play are not those which they imagine, not those which are in sight. For example, this man plays for a petty once, and gains it; but the real stake he gains is sycophancy, uncharitableness,
slander, and deceit.
Good men are too proud of their goodness. They are respectable; dishonour comes not near them; their countenance has weight and influence; their robes are unstained; the poisonous breath of calumny as
never been breathed upon their fair name. How easy it is for them to look down with scorn upon the poor degraded offender; to pass him by with a lofty step; to draw up the folds of their garment around
them, that they may not be soiled by his touch ! Yet the Great Master of Virtue did not so; but descended to familiar intercourse with publicans and sinners, with the Samaritan woman, with the
outcasts and the Pariahs of the Hebrew world.
Many men think themselves better, in proportion as they can detect sin in others! When they go over the catalogue of their neighbour's unhappy derelictions of temper or conduct, they often, amidst much
apparent concern, feel a secret exultation, that destroys all their own pretensions to wisdom and moderation, and even to virtue. Many even take actual pleasure in the sins of others; and this is the case
with every one whose thoughts are often employed in agreeable comparisons of his own virtues with his neighbours' faults.
The power of gentleness is too little seen in the world; the subduing influences of pity, the might of
love, the control of mildness over passion, the commanding majesty of that perfect character which

mingles grave displeasure with grief and pity for the offender. So it is that a Mason should treat his brethren who go astray. Not with bitterness; nor yet with goodnatured easiness, nor with worldly
indifference, nor with the philosophic coldness, nor with a laxity of conscience, that accounts everything well, that passes under the seal of public opinion; but with charity, with pitying loving
kindness.
The human heart will not bow willingly to what is infirm and wrong in human nature. If it yields to us, it must yield to what is divine in us. The wickedness of my neighbour cannot submit to my wickedness;
his sensuality, for instance, to my anger against his vices. My faults are not the instruments that are to arrest his faults. And therefore impatient reformers, and denouncing preachers, and hasty reprovers, and
angry parents, and irritable relatives generally fail, in their several departments, to reclaim the erring.
A moral offence is sickness, pain, loss, dishonour, in the immortal part of man. It is guilt, and misery added to guilt. It is itself calamity; and brings upon itself, in addition, the calamity of God's
disapproval, the abhorrence of all virtuous men, and the soul's own abhorrence. Deal faithfully, but patiently and tenderly, with this evil! It is no matter for petty provocation, nor for personal strife, nor for
selfish irritation.
Speak kindly to your erring brother! God pities him: Christ has died for him: Providence waits for him: Heaven's mercy yearns toward him; and Heaven's spirits are ready to welcome him back with joy. Let
your voice be in unison with all those powers that God is using for his recovery!
If one defrauds you, and exults at it, he is the most to be pitied of human beings. He has done himself a far deeper injury than he has done you. It is he, and not you, whom God regards with mingled
displeasure and compassion; and His judgment should be your law. Among all the benedictions of the Holy Mount there is not one for this man; but for the merciful, the peacemakers, and the persecuted
they are poured out freely.
We are all men of like passions, propensities, and exposures. There are elements in us all, which might have been perverted, through the successive processes of moral deterioration, to the worst of crimes.
The wretch whom the execration of the thronging crowd pursues to the scaffold, is not worse than any one of that multitude might have become under similar circumstances. He is to be condemned indeed,
but also deeply to be pitied.
It does not become the frail and sinful to be vindictive toward even the worst criminals. We owe much to the good Providence of God, ordaining for us a lot more favourable to virtue. We all had that within
us, that might have been pushed to the same excess: Perhaps we should have fallen as he did, with less temptation. Perhaps we have done acts, that, in proportion to the temptation or provocation, were less

excusable than his great crime. Silent pity and sorrow for the victim should mingle with our detestation of the guilt. Even the pirate who murders in cold blood on the high seas, is such a man as you or I
might have been. Orphanage in childhood, or base and dissolute and abandoned parents; an unfriended youth; evil companions; ignorance and want of moral cultivation; the temptations of sinful pleasure or
grinding poverty; familiarity with vice; a scorned and blighted name; seared and crushed affections; desperate fortunes; these are steps that might have led any one among us to unfurl upon the high seas
the bloody flag of universal defiance; to wage war with our kind; to live the life and die the death of the reckless and remorseless freebooter. Many affecting relationships of humanity plead with us to pity
him. His head once rested on a mother's bosom. He was once the object of sisterly love and domestic endearment. Perhaps his hand, since often red with blood, once clasped another little loving hand at the
altar. Pity him then; his blighted hopes and his crushed heart! It is proper that frail and erring creatures like us should do so; should feel the crime, but feel it as weak, tempted, and rescued creatures should. It
may be that when God weighs men's crimes, He will take into consideration the temptations and the adverse circumstances that led to them, and the opportunities for moral culture of the offender; and it
may be that our own offences will weigh heavier than we think, and the murderer's lighter than according to man's judgment.
On all accounts, therefore, let the true Mason never forget the solemn injunction, necessary to be
observed at almost every moment of a busy life: 'JUDGE NOT, LEST YOU YOURSELVES BE JUDGED FOR WHATSOEVER JUDGMENT YOU MEASURE UNTO OTHERS, THE SAME
SHALL IN TURN BE MEASURED UNTO YOU. Such is the lesson taught the Provost and Judge of man.
VIII. INTENDANT OF THE BUILDING.
IN this Degree you have been taught the important lesson, that none are entitled to advance in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, who have not by study and application made themselves familiar
with Masonic learning and jurisprudence. The Degrees of this Rite are not for those who are content with the mere work and ceremonies, and do not seek to explore the mines of wisdom that lie buried
beneath the surface. You still advance toward the Light, toward that star, blazing in the distance, which is an emblem of the Divine Truth, given by God to the first men, and preserved amid all the vicissitudes
of ages in the traditions and teachings of Masonry. How far you will advance, depends upon yourself alone. Here, as everywhere in the world, Darkness struggles with Light, and clouds and shadows
intervene between you and the Truth.
When you shall have become imbued with the morality of Masonry, with which you yet are, and for some time will be exclusively occupied, when you shall have learned to practice all the virtues which it
inculcates; when they become familiar to you as your Household Gods; then will you be prepared to

receive its lofty philosophical instruction, and to scale the heights upon whose summit Light and Truth sit enthroned. Step by step men must advance toward Perfection; and each Masonic Degree is meant to
be one of those steps. Each is a development of a particular duty; and in the present you are taught charity and benevolence; to be to your brethren an example of virtue; to correct your own faults; and to
endeavour to correct those of your brethren.
Here, as in all the degrees, you meet with the emblems and the names of Deity, the true knowledge of whose character and attributes it has ever been a chief object of Masonry to perpetuate. To appreciate
His infinite greatness and goodness, to rely implicitly upon His Providence, to revere and venerate Him as the Supreme Architect, Creator, and Legislator of the universe, is the first of Masonic duties.
The Battery of this Degree, and the five circuits which you made around the Lodge, allude to the five
points of fellowship, and are intended to recall them vividly to your mind. To go upon a brother's errand or to his relief, even barefoot and upon flinty ground; to remember him in your supplications to the
Deity; to clasp him to your heart, and protect him against malice and evil speaking; to uphold him when about to stumble and fall; and to give him prudent, honest, and friendly counsel, are duties plainly
written upon the pages of God's great code of law, and first among the ordinances of Masonry.
The first sign of the Degree is expressive of the diffidence and humility with which we inquire into the nature and attributes of the Deity; the second, of the profound awe and reverence with which we
contemplate His glories; and the third, of the sorrow with which we reflect upon our insufficient observance of our duties, and our imperfect compliance with His statutes.
The distinguishing property of man is to search for and follow after truth. Therefore, when relaxed from
our necessary cares and concerns, we then covet to see, to hear, and to learn somewhat; and we esteem knowledge of things, either obscure or wonderful, to be the indispensable means of living happily.
Truth, Simplicity, and Candor are most agreeable to the nature of mankind. Whatever is virtuous consists either in Sagacity, and the perception of Truth; or in the preservation of Human Society, by
giving to every man his due, and observing the faith of contracts; or in the greatness and firmness of an elevated and unsubdued mind; or in observing order and regularity in all our words and in all our
actions; in which consist Moderation and Temperance.
Masonry has in all times religiously preserved that enlightened faith from which flow sublime Devotedness, the sentiment of Fraternity fruitful of good works, the spirit of indulgence and peace, of
sweet hopes and effectual consolations; and inflexibility in the accomplishment of the most painful and arduous duties. It has always propagated it with ardor and perseverance; and therefore it labours at the
present day more zealously than ever. Scarcely a Masonic discourse is pronounced, that does not demonstrate the necessity and advantages of this faith, and especially recall the two constitutive

110/641
principles of religion, that make all religion, love of God, and love of neighbour. Masons carry these principles into the bosoms of their families and of society. While the Sectarians of former times
enfeebled the religious spirit, Masonry, forming one great People over the whole globe, and marching under the great banner of Charity and Benevolence, preserves that religious feeling, strengthens it,
extends it in its purity and simplicity, as it has always existed in the depths of the human heart, as it existed even under the dominion of the most ancient forms of worship, but where gross and debasing
superstitions forbade its recognition.
A Masonic Lodge should resemble a beehive, in which all the members work together with ardor for the common good. Masonry is not made for cold souls and narrow minds, that do not comprehend its
lofty mission and sublime apostolate. Here the anathema against lukewarm souls applies. To comfort misfortunes to popularize knowledge, to teach whatever is true and pure in religion and philosophy, to
accustom men to respect order and the proprieties of life, to point out the way to genuine happiness, to prepare for that fortunate period, when all the factions of the Human Family, united by the bonds of
Toleration and Fraternity, shall be but one household, these are labours that may well excite zeal and even enthusiasm.
We do not now enlarge upon or elaborate these ideas. We but utter them to you briefly, as hints, upon
which you may at your leisure reflect. Hereafter, if you continue to advance, they will be unfolded, explained, and developed.
Masonry utters no impracticable and extravagant precepts, certain, because they are so, to be
disregarded. It asks of its initiates nothing that it is not possible and even easy for them to perform. Its teachings are eminently practical; and its statutes can be obeyed by every just, upright, and honest man,
no matter what his faith or creed. Its object is to attain the greatest practical good, without seeking to make men perfect. It does not meddle with the domain of religion, nor inquire into the mysteries of
regeneration. It teaches those truths that are written by the finger of God upon the heart of man, those views of duty which have been brought out by the meditations of the studious, confirmed by the
allegiance of the good and wise, and stamped as sterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind. It does not dogmatize, nor vainly imagine dogmatic certainty to be attainable.
Masonry does not occupy itself with crying down this world, with its splendid beauty, its thrilling
interests, its glorious works, its noble and holy affections; nor exhort us to detach our hearts from this earthly life, as empty, fleeting, and unworthy, and fix them upon Heaven, as the only sphere deserving
the love of the loving or the meditation of the wise. It teaches that man has high duties to perform, and a high destiny to fulfill, on this earth; that this world is not merely the portal to another; and that this
life, though not our only one, is an integral one, and the particular one with which we are here meant to be concerned; that the Present is our scene of action, and the Future for speculation and for trust; that
man was sent upon the earth to live in it, to enjoy it, to study it, to love it, to embellish it, to make the

111/641
most of it. It is his country, on which he should lavish his affections and his efforts. It is here his influences are to operate. It is his house, and not a tent; his home, and not merely a school. He is sent
into this world, not to be constantly hankering after, dreaming of, preparing for another; but to do his duty and fulfill his destiny on this earth; to do all that lies in his power to improve it, to render it a scene
of elevated happiness to himself, to those around him, to those who are to come after him. His life here is part of his immortality; and this world, also, is among the stars.
And thus, Masonry teaches us, will man best prepare for that Future which he hopes for. The Unseen
cannot hold a higher place in our affections than the Seen and the Familiar. The law of our being is Love of Life, and its interests and adornments; love of the world in which our lot is cast, engrossment
with the interests and affections of earth. Not a low or sensual love, not love of wealth, of fame, of ease, of power, of splendour. Not low worldliness; but the love of Earth as the garden on which the Creator
has lavished such miracles of beauty; as the habitation of humanity, the arena of its conflicts, the scene of its illimitable progress, the dwellingplace of the wise, the good, the active, the loving, and the dear;
the place of opportunity for the development by means of sin and suffering and sorrow, of the noblest passions the loftiest virtues, and the tenderest sympathies.
They take very unprofitable pains, who endeavour to persuade men that they are obliged wholly to
despise this world, and all that is in it, even whilst they themselves live here. God hath not taken all that pains in forming and framing and furnishing and adorning the world, that they who were made by Him
to live in it should despise it. It will be enough, if they do not love it too immoderately. It is useless to attempt to extinguish all those affections and passions which are and always will be inseparable from
human nature. As long as he world lasts, and honour and virtue and industry have reputation in the world, there will be ambition and emulation and appetite in the best and most accomplished men in it;
and if there were not, more barbarity and vice and wickedness would cover every nation of the world, than it now suffers under.
Those only who feel a deep interest in, and affection for, this world, will work resolutely for its
amelioration. Those who undervalue this rife, naturally become querulous and discontented, and lose their interest in the welfare of their fellows. To serve them, and so to do our duty as Masons, we must
feel that the object is worth the exertion; and be content with this world in which God has placed us, until He permits us to remove to a better one. He is here with us, and does not deem this an unworthy
world.
It a serious thing to defame and belie a whole world; to speak of it as the abode of a poor, toiling, drudging, ignorant, contemptible race. You would not so discredit your family, your friendly circle, your
village, your city, your country. The world is not a wretched and a worthless one; nor is it a misfortune, but a thing to be thankful for, to be a man. If life is worthless, so also is immortality.

In society itself, in that living mechanism of human relationships that spreads itself over the world, there is a finer essence within, that as truly moves it, as any power, heavy or expansive, moves the
sounding manufactory or the swiftflying car. The manmachine hurries to and fro upon the earth, stretches out its hands on every side, to toil, to barter, to unnumbered labours and enterprises; and
almost always the motive, that which moves it, is something that takes hold of the comforts, affections, and hopes of social existence. True, the mechanism often works with difficulty, drags heavily, grates
and screams with harsh collision. True, the essence of finer motive, becoming intermixed with baser and coarser ingredients, often clogs, obstructs, jars, and deranges the free and noble action of social
life. But he is neither grateful nor wise, who looks cynically on all this, and loses the fine sense of social good in its perversions. That I can be a friend, that I can have a friend, though it were but one in
the world; that fact, that wondrous good fortune, we may set against all the sufferings of our social nature. That there is such a place on earth as a home, that resort and sanctuary of inwalled and
shielded joy, we may set against all the surrounding desolations of life. That one can be a true, social man, can speak his true thoughts, amidst all the Tanglings of controversy and the warring of opinions;
that fact from within, outweighs all facts from without.
In the visible aspect and action of society, often repulsive and annoying, we are apt to lose the due sense of its invisible blessings. As in Nature it is not the coarse and palpable, not soils and rains, nor
even fields and flowers, that are so beautiful, as the invisible spirit of wisdom and beauty that pervades it; so in society, it is the invisible, and therefore unobserved, that is most beautiful.
What nerves the arm of toil? If man minded himself alone, he would fling down the spade and axe, and
rush to the desert; or roam through the world as a wilderness, and make that world a desert. His home, which he sees not, perhaps, but once or twice in a day, is the invisible bond of the world. It is the good,
strong, and noble faith that men have in each other, which gives the loftiest character to business, trade, and commerce. Fraud occurs in the rush of business; but it is the exception. Honesty is the rule; and all
the frauds in the world cannot tear the great bond of human confidence. If they could, commerce would furl its sails on every sea, and all the cities of the world would crumble into ruins. The bare character of
a man on the other side of the world, whom you never saw, whom you never will see, you hold good for a bond of thousands. The most striking feature of the political state is not governments, nor
constitutions, nor laws, nor enactments, nor the judicial power, nor the police; but the universal will of the people to be governed by the common weal. Take off that restraint, and no government on earth
could stand for an hour.
Of the many teachings of Masonry, one of the most valuable is, that we should not depreciate this life. It does not hold, that when we reflect on the destiny that awaits man on earth, we ought to bedew his
cradle with our tears; but, like the Hebrews, it hails the birth of a child with joy, and holds that his birthday should be a festival.

It has no sympathy with those who profess to have proved this life, and found it little worth; who have deliberately made up their minds that it is far more miserable than happy; because its employments are
tedious, and their schemes often baffled, their friendships broken, or their friends dead, its pleasures palled, and its honours faded, and its paths beaten, familiar, and dull.
Masonry deems it no mark of great piety toward God to disparage, if not despise, the state that He has
ordained for us. It does not absurdly set up the claims of another world, not in comparison merely, but in competition, with the claims of this. It looks upon both as parts of one system. It holds that a man
may make the best of this world and of another at the same time. It does not teach its initiates to think better of other works and dispensations of God, by thinking meanly of these. It does not look upon life
as so much time lost; nor regard its employments as trifles unworthy of immortal beings; nor tell its followers to fold their arms, as if in disdain of their state and species; but it looks soberly and cheerfully
upon the world, as a theatre of worthy action, of exalted usefulness, and of rational and innocent enjoyment.
It holds that, with all its evils, life is a blessing. To deny that is to destroy the basis of all religion,
natural and revealed. The very foundation of all religion is laid on the firm belief that God is good; and if this life is an evil and a curse, no such belief can be rationally entertained. To level our satire at
humanity and human existence, as mean and contemptible; to look on this world as the habitation of a miserable race, fit only for mockery and scorn; to consider this earth as a dungeon or a prison, which
has no blessing to offer but escape from it, is to extinguish the primal light of faith and hope and happiness, to destroy the basis of religion, and Truth's foundation in the goodness of God. If it indeed
be so, then it matters not what else is true or not true; speculation is vain and faith is vain; and all that belongs to man's highest being is buried in the ruins of misanthropy, melancholy, and despair.
Our love of life; the tenacity with which, in sorrow and suffering, we cling to it; our attachment to our
home, to the spot that gave us birth, to any place, however rude, unsightly, or barren, on which the history of our years has been written, all show how dear are the ties of kindred and society. Misery
makes a greater impression upon us than happiness; because the former is not the habit of our minds. It is a strange, unusual guest, and we are more conscious of its presence. Happiness lives with us, and we
forget it. It does not excite us, nor disturb the order and course of our thoughts. A great agony is an epoch in our life. We remember our afflictions, as we do the storm and earthquake, because they are out
of the common course of things. They are like disastrous events, recorded because extraordinary; and with whole and unnoticed periods of prosperity between. We mark and signalize the times of calamity;
but many happy days and unnoted periods of enjoyment pass, that are unrecorded either in the book of memory, or in the scanty annals of our thanksgiving. We are little disposed and less able to call up from
the dim remembrances of our past years, the peaceful moments, the easy sensations, the bright thoughts, the quiet reveries, the throngs of kind affections in which life flowed on, bearing us almost
unconsciously upon its bosom, because it bore us calmly and gently.

Life is not only good; but it has been glorious in the experience of millions. The glory of all human virtue clothes it. The splendours of devotedness, beneficence, and heroism are upon it; the crown of a
thousand martyrdoms is upon its brow. The brightness of the soul shines through this visible and sometimes darkened life; through all its surrounding cares and labours. The humblest life may feel its
connection with its Infinite Source. There is something mighty in the frail inner man; something of immortality in this momentary and transient being. The mind stretches away, on every side, into
infinity. Its thoughts flash abroad, far into the boundless, the immeasurable, the infinite; far into the great, dark, teeming future; and become powers and influences in other ages. To know its wonderful
Author, to bring down wisdom from the Eternal Stars, to bear upward its homage, gratitude, and love, to the Ruler of all worlds, to be immortal in our influences projected far into the slowapproaching
Future, makes life most worthy and most glorious.
Life is the wonderful creation of God. It is light, sprung from void darkness; power, waked from inertness and impotence; being created from nothing; and the contrast may well enkindle wonder and
delight. It is a rill from the infinite, overflowing goodness; and from the moment when it first gushes up into the light, to that when it mingles with the ocean of Eternity, that Goodness attends it and ministers
to it. It is a great and glorious gift. There is gladness in its infant voices; joy in the buoyant step of its youth; deep satisfaction in its strong maturity; and peace in its quiet age. There is good for the good;
virtue for the faithful; and victory for the valiant. There is, even in this humble life, an infinity for those whose desires are boundless. There are blessings upon its birth; there is hope in its death; and eternity
in its prospect. Thus earth, which binds many in chains, is to the Mason both the startingplace and goal of immortality, Many it buries in the rubbish of dull cares and wearying vanities; but to the Mason it is
the lofty mount of meditation, where Heaven, and Infinity and Eternity are spread before him and around him. To the loftyminded, the pure, and the virtuous, this life is the beginning of Heaven, and a
part of immortality.
God hath appointed one remedy for all the evils in the world; and that is a contented spirit. We may be reconciled to poverty and a low fortune, if we suffer contentedness and equanimity to make the
proportions. No man is poor who doth not think himself so; but if, in a full fortune, with impatience he desires more, he proclaims his wants and his beggarly condition. This virtue of contentedness was the
sum of all the old moral philosophy, and is of most universal use in the whole course of our lives, and the only instrument to ease the burdens of the world and the enmities of sad chances. It is the great
reasonableness of complying with the Divine Providence, which governs all the world, and hath so ordered us in the administration of His great family. It is fit that God should dispense His gifts as He
pleases; and if we murmur here, we may, at the next melancholy, be troubled that He did not make us to be angels or stars.
We ourselves make our fortunes good or bad; and when God lets loose a Tyrant upon us, or a sickness,
or scorn, or a lessened fortune, if we fear to die, or know not how to be patient, or are proud, or covetous, then the calamity sits heavy on us. But if we know how to manage a noble principle, and fear

not death so much as a dishonest action, and think impatience a worse evil than a fever, and pride to be the greatest disgrace as well as the greatest folly, and poverty far preferable to the torments of avarice,
we may still bear an even mind and smile at the reverses of fortune and the illnature of Fate.
If thou hast lost thy land, do not also lose thy constancy; and if thou must die sooner than others, or than thou didst expect, yet do not die impatiently. For no chance is evil to him who is content, and to a
man nothing is miserable unless it be unreasonable. No man can make another man to be his slave, unless that other hath first enslaved himself to life and death, to pleasure or pain, to hope or fear;
command these passions, and you are freer than the Parthian Kings.
When an enemy reproaches us, let us look on him as an impartial relator of our faults; for he will tell us truer than our fondest friend will, and we may forgive his anger, whilst we make use of the plainness of
his declamation. The ox, when he is weary, treads truest; and if there be nothing else in abuse, but that it makes us to walk warily, and tread sure for fear of our enemies, that is better than to be flattered into
pride and carelessness.
If thou fallest from thy employment in public, take sanctuary in an honest retirement, being indifferent to thy gain abroad, or thy safety at home. When the north wind blows hard, and it rains sadly, we do not
sit down in it and cry; but defend ourselves against it with a warm garment, or a good fire and a dry roof. So when the storm of a sad mischance beats upon our spirits, we may turn it into something that is
good, if we resolve to make it so; and with equanimity and patience may shelter ourselves from its inclement pitiless pelting. If it develop our patience, and give occasion for heroic endurance, it hath
done us good enough to recompense us sufficiently for all the temporal affliction; for so a wise man shall overrule his stars; and have a greater influence upon his own content, than all the constellations
and planets of the firmament.
Compare not thy condition with the few above thee, but to secure thy content, look upon those thousands with whom thou wouldst not, for any interest, change thy fortune and condition. A soldier
must not think himself unprosperous, if he be not successful as Alexander or Wellington; nor any man deem himself unfortunate that he hath not the wealth of Rothschild; but rather let the former rejoice that
he is not lessened like the many generals who went down horse and man before Napoleon, and the latter that he is not the beggar who, bareheaded in the bleak winter wind holds out his tattered hat for charity.
There may be many who are richer and more fortunate; but many thousands who are very miserable, compared to thee.
After the worst assaults of Fortune, there will be something left to us,a merry countenance, a cheerful
spirit, and a good conscience, the Providence of God, our hopes of Heaven, our charity for those who have injured us; perhaps a loving wife, and many friends to pity, and some to relieve us; and light and

air, and all the beauties of Nature; we can read, discourse, and meditate; and having still these blessings, we should be much in love with sorrow and peevishness to lose them all, and prefer to sit
down on our little handful of thorns.
Enjoy the blessings of this day, if God sends them, and the evils of it bear patiently and calmly; for this day only is ours: we are dead to yesterday, and we are not yet born to the morrow. When our fortunes
are violently changed, our spirits are unchanged, if they always stood in the suburbs and expectation of sorrows and reverses. The blessings of immunity, safeguard, liberty, and integrity deserve the
thanksgiving of a whole life. We are quit from a thousand calamities, every one of which, if it were upon us, would make us insensible of our present sorrow, and glad to receive it in exchange for that
other greater affliction.
Measure your desires by your fortune and condition, not your fortunes by your desires: be governed by your needs, not by your fancy; by nature, not by evil customs and ambitious principles. It is no evil to
be poor, but to be vicious and impatient. Is that beast better, that hath two or three mountains to graze on, than the little bee that feeds on dew or manna, and lives upon what falls every morning from the
storehouses of Heaven, clouds and Providence ?
There are some instances of fortune and a fair condition that cannot stand with some others; but if you desire this, you must lose that, and unless you be content with one, you lose the comfort of both. If you
covet learning, you must have leisure and a retired life; if honours of State and political distinctions, you must be ever abroad in public, and get experience, and do all men's business, and keep all company, and
have no leisure at all. If you will be rich, you must be frugal; if you will be popular, you must be bountiful; if a philosopher, you must despise riches. If you would be famous as Epaminondas, accept
also his poverty, for it added lustre to his person, and envy to his fortune, and his virtue without it could not have been so excellent. If you would have the reputation of a martyr, you must needs accept his
persecution; if of a benefactor of the world, the world's injustice; if truly great, you must expect to see the mob prefer lesser men to yourself.
God esteems it one of His glories, that He brings good out of evil; and therefore it were but reason we
should trust Him to govern His own world as He pleases; and that we should patiently wait until the change cometh, or the reason is discovered.
A Mason's contentedness must by no means be a mere contented selfishness, like his who, comfortable
himself, is indifferent to the discomfort of others. There will always be in this world wrongs to forgive, suffering to alleviate, sorrow asking for sympathy, necessities and destitution to relieve, and ample
occasion for the exercise of active charity and beneficence. And he who sits unconcerned amidst it all, perhaps enjoying his own comforts and luxuries the more, by contrasting them with the hungry and

ragged destitution and shivering misery of his fellows, is not contented, but selfish and unfeeling.
It is the saddest of all sights upon this earth, that of a man lazy and luxurious, or hard and penurious, to whom want appeals in vain, and suffering cries in an unknown tongue. The man whose hasty anger
hurries him into violence and crime is not half so unworthy to live. He is the faithless steward, that embezzles what God has given him in trust for the impoverished and suffering among his brethren. The
true Mason must be and must have a right to be content with himself; and he can be so only when he lives not for himself alone, but for others also, who need his assistance and have a claim upon his
sympathy.
"Charity is the great channel," it has been well said, "through which God passes all His mercy upon mankind. For we receive absolution of our sins in proportion to our forgiving our brother. This is the
rule of our hopes and the measure of our desire in this world; and on the day of death and judgment, the great sentence upon mankind shall be transacted according to our alms, which is the other part of
charity. God himself is love; and very degree of charity that dwells in us is the participation of the divine nature."
These principles Masonry reduces to practice. By them it expects you to be hereafter guided and
governed. It especially inculcates them upon him who employs the labour of others, forbidding him to discharge them, when to want employment is to starve; or to contract for the labour of man or woman at
so low a price that by overexertion they must sell him their blood and life at the same time with the labour of their hands.
These Degrees are also intended to teach more than morals. The symbols and ceremonies of Masonry
have more than one meaning. They rather conceal than disclose the Truth. They hint it only, at least; and their varied meanings are only to be discovered by reflection and study. Truth is not only
symbolized by Light, but as the ray of light is separable into rays of different colours, so is truth separable into kinds. It is the province of Masonry to teach all truthsnot moral truth alone, but
political and philosophical, and even religious truth, so far as concerns the great and essential principles of each. The sphynx was a symbol. To whom has it disclosed its inmost meaning? Who knows the
symbolic meaning of the pyramids?
You will hereafter learn who are the chief foes of human liberty symbolized by the assassins of the Master Khurum; and in their fate you may see foreshadowed that which we earnestly hope will
hereafter overtake those enemies of humanity, against whom Masonry has struggled so long.

IX. ELECT OF THE NINE
[Elu of the Nine]
ORIGINALLY created to reward fidelity, obedience, and devotion, this Degree was consecrated to bravery, devotedness, and patriotism; and your obligation has made known to you the duties which you
have assumed. They are summed up in the simple mandate, "Protect the oppressed against the oppressor; and devote yourself to the honour and interests of your Country."
Masonry is not "speculative," nor theoretical, but experimental; not sentimental, but practical. It
requires selfrenunciation and selfcontrol. It wears a stern face toward men's vices, and interferes with many of our pursuits and our fancied pleasures. It penetrates beyond the region of vague sentiment;
beyond the regions where moralizers and philosophers have woven their fine theories and elaborated their beautiful maxims, to the very depths of the heart, rebuking our littlenesses and meannesses,
arraigning our prejudices and passions, and warring against the armies of our vices.
It wars against the passions that spring out of the bosom of a world of fine sentiments, a world of admirable sayings and foul practices, of good maxims and bad deeds; whose darker passions are not
only restrained by custom and ceremony, but hidden even from itself by a veil of beautiful sentiments. This terrible solecism has existed in all ages. Romish sentimentalism has often covered infidelity and
vice; Protestant straightness often lauds spirituality and faith, and neglects homely truth, candor, and generosity; and ultraliberal Rationalistic refinement sometimes soars to heaven in its dreams, and
wallows in the mire of earth in its deeds.
There may be a world of Masonic sentiment; and yet a world of little or no Masonry. In many minds there is a vague and general sentiment of Masonic charity, generosity, and disinterestedness, but no
practical, active virtue, nor habitual kindness, self sacrifice, or liberality. Masonry plays about them like the cold though brilliant lights that flush and eddy over Northern skies. There are occasional flashes of
generous and manly feeling, transitory splendours, and momentary gleams of just and noble thought, and transient coruscations, that light the Heaven of their imagination; but there is no vital warmth in the
heart; and it remains as cold and sterile as the Arctic or Antarctic regions. They do nothing; they gain no victories over themselves; they make no progress; they are still in the Northeast corner of the Lodge,
as when they first stood there as Apprentices; and they do not cultivate Masonry, with a cultivation, determined, resolute, and regular, like their cultivation of their estate, profession, or knowledge. Their
Masonry takes its chance in general and inefficient sentiment, mournfully barren of results; in words and formulas and fine professions.
Most men have sentiments, but not principles. The former are temporary sensations, the latter
permanent and controlling impressions of goodness and virtue. The former are general and involuntary,

and do not rise to the character of virtue. Every one feels them. They flash up spontaneously in every heart. The latter are rules of action, and shape and control our conduct; and it is these that Masonry
insists upon.
We approve the right; but pursue the wrong. It is the old story of human deficiency. No one abets or praises injustice, fraud, oppression, covetousness, revenge, envy or slander; and yet how many who
condemn these things, are themselves guilty of them. It is no rare thing for him whose indignation is kindled at a tale of wicked injustice, cruel oppression base slander, or misery inflicted by unbridled
indulgence; whose anger flames in behalf of the injured and ruined victims of wrong; to be in some relation unjust, or oppressive, or envious, or selfindulgent, or a careless talker of others. How
wonderfully indignant the penurious man often is, at the avarice or want of public spirit of another!
A great Preacher well said, "Therefore thou art inexcusable. O Man, whosoever thou art, that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that judgest, doest the same things."
It is amazing to see how men can talk of virtue and honour, whose life denies both. It is curious to see with what a marvellous facility many bad men quote Scripture. It seems to comfort their evil
consciences, to use good words; and to gloze over bad deeds with holy texts, wrested to their purpose. Often, the more a man talks about Charity and Toleration, the less he has of either; the more he talks
about Virtue, the smaller stock he has of it. The mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart; but often the very reverse of what the man practises. And the vicious and sensual often express, and in a
sense feel, strong disgust at vice and sensuality. Hypocrisy is not so common as is imagined.
Here, in the Lodge, virtue and vice are matters of reflection and feeling only. There is little opportunity here, for the practice of either; and Masons yield to the argument here, with facility and readiness;
because nothing is to follow. It is easy, and safe, here, too feel upon these matters. But tomorrow, when they breathe the atmosphere of worldly gains and competitions, and the passions are again stirred at the
opportunities of unlawful pleasure, all their fine emotions about virtue, all their generous abhorrence of selfishness and sensuality, melt away like a morning cloud.
For the time, their emotions and sentiments are sincere and real. Men may be really, in a certain way,
interested in Masonry, while fatally deficient in virtue. It is not always hypocrisy. Men pray most fervently and sincerely, and yet are constantly guilty of acts so bad and base, so ungenerous and
unrighteous, that the crimes that crowd the dockets of our courts are scarcely worse.
A man may be a good sort of man in general, and yet a very bad man in particular: good in the Lodge and bad in the world; good in public, and bad in his family; good at home, and bad on a journey or in a
strange city. Many a man earnestly desires to be a good Mason. He says so, and is sincere. But if you require him to resist a certain passion, to sacrifice a certain indulgence, to control his appetite at a

particular feast, or to keep his temper in a dispute, you will find that he does not wish to be a good Mason, in that particular case; or, wishing, is not able to resist his worst impulses.
The duties of life are more than life. The law imposeth it upon every citizen, that he prefer the urgent
service of his country before the safety of his life. If a man be commanded, saith a great writer, to bring ordnance or munition to relieve any of the King's towns that are distressed, then he cannot for any
danger of tempest justify the throwing of them overboard; for there it holdeth which was spoken by the Roman, when the same necessity of weather was alleged to hold him from embarking: "Necesse est ut
eam, non ut vivam :" it needs that I go: it is not necessary I should live.
How ungratefully he slinks away, who dies, and does nothing to reflect a glory to Heaven ! How barren a tree he is, who lives, and spreads, and cumbers the ground, yet leaves not one seed, not one good work
to generate another after him ! All cannot leave alike; yet all may leave something, answering their proportions and their kinds. Those are dead and withered grains of corn, out of which there will not one
ear spring. He will hardly find the way to Heaven, who desires to go thither alone.
Industry is never wholly unfruitful. If it bring not joy with the incoming profit, it will yet banish mischief from thy busied gates. There is a kind of good angel waiting upon Diligence that ever carries a
laurel in his hand to crown her. How unworthy was that man of the world who never did aught, but only lived and died! That we have liberty to do anything, we should account it a gift from the favouring
Heavens; that we have minds sometimes inclining us to use that liberty well, is a great bounty of the Deity.
Masonry is action, and not inertness. It requires its Initiates to WORK, actively and earnestly, for the
benefit of their brethren, their country, and mankind. It is the patron of the oppressed, as it is the comforter and consoler of the unfortunate and wretched. It seems to it a worthier honour to be the
instrument of advancement and reform, than to enjoy all that rank and office and lofty titles can bestow. It is the advocate of the common people in those things which concern the best interests of mankind. It
hates insolent power and impudent usurpation. It pities the poor, the sorrowing, the disconsolate; it endeavours to raise and improve the ignorant, the sunken, and the degraded.
Its fidelity to its mission will be accurately evidenced, by the extent of the efforts it employs, and the
means it sets on foot, to improve the people at large and to better their condition; chiefest of which, within its reach, is to aid in the education of the children of the poor. An intelligent people, informed of
its rights, will soon come to know its power, and cannot long be oppressed; but if there be not a sound and virtuous populace, the elaborate ornaments at the top of the pyramid of society will be a wretched
compensation for the want of solidity at the base. It is never safe for a nation to repose on the lap of ignorance: and if there ever was a time when public tranquillity was insured by the absence of

121/641
knowledge, that season is past. Unthinking stupidity cannot sleep, without being appalled by phantoms and shaken by terrors. The improvement of the mass of the people is the grand security for popular
liberty; in the neglect of which, the politeness, refinement, and knowledge accumulated in the higher orders and wealthier classes will some day perish like dry grass in the hot fire of popular fury.
It is not the mission of Masonry to engage in plots and conspiracies against the civil government. It is
not the fanatical propagandist of any creed or theory; nor does it proclaim itself the enemy of kings. It is the apostle of liberty, equality, and fraternity; but it is no more the highpriest of republicanism than of
constitutional monarchy. It contracts no entangling alliances with any sect of theorists, dreamers, or philosophers. It does not know those as its Initiates who assail the civil order and all lawful authority, at
the same time that they propose to deprive the dying of the consolations of religion. It sits apart from all sects and creeds, in its own calm and simple dignity, the same under every government. It is still that
which it was in the cradle of the human race, when no human foot had trodden the soil of Assyria and Egypt, and no colonies had crossed the Himalayas into Southern India, Media, or Etruria.
It gives no countenance to anarchy and licentiousness; and no illusion of glory, or extravagant
emulation of the ancients inflames it with an unnatural thirst for ideal and Utopian liberty. It teaches that in rectitude of life and sobriety of habits is the only sure guarantee for the continuance of political
freedom, and it is chiefly the soldier of the sanctity of the laws and the rights of conscience.
It recognizes it as a truth, that necessity, as well as abstract right and ideal justice, must have its part in the making of laws, the administration of affairs, and the regulation of relations in society. It sees,
indeed, that necessity rules in all the affairs of man. It knows that where any man, or any number or race of men, are so imbecile of intellect, so degraded, so incapable of self control, so inferior in the
scale of humanity, as to be unfit to be intrusted with the highest prerogatives of citizenship, the great law of necessity, for the peace and safety of the community and country, requires them to remain under
the control of those of larger intellect and superior wisdom. It trusts and believes that God will, in his own good time, work out his own great and wise purposes; and it is willing to wait, where it does not
see its own way clear to some certain good.
It hopes and longs for the day when all the races of men, even the lowest, will be elevated, and become fitted for political freedom; when, like all other evils that afflict the earth, pauperism, and bondage or
abject dependence, shall cease and disappear. But it does not preach revolution to those who are fond of kings, nor rebellion that can end only in disaster and defeat, or in substituting one tyrant for another, or
a multitude of despots for one.
Wherever a people is fit to be free and to govern itself, and generously strives to be so, there go all its sympathies. It detests the tyrant, the lawless oppressor, the military usurper, and him who abuses a

122/641
lawful power. It frowns upon cruelty, and a wanton disregard of the rights of humanity. It abhors the selfish employer, and exerts its influence to lighten the burdens which want and dependence impose
upon the workman, and to foster that humanity and kindness which man owes to even the poorest and most unfortunate brother.
It can never be employed, in any country under Heaven, to teach a toleration for cruelty, to weaken
moral hatred for guilt, or to deprave and brutalize the human mind. The dread of punishment will never make a Mason an accomplice in so corrupting his countrymen, and a teacher of depravity and barbarity.
If anywhere, as has heretofore happened, a tyrant should send a satirist on his tyranny to be convicted and punished as a libeller, in a court of justice, a Mason, if a juror in such a case, though in sight of the
scaffold streaming with the blood of the innocent, and within hearing of the clash of the bayonets meant to overawe the court, would rescue the intrepid satirist from the tyrant's fangs, and send his officers out
from the court with defeat and disgrace.
Even if all law and liberty were trampled under the feet of Jacobinical demagogues or a military banditti, and great crimes were perpetrated with a high hand against all who were deservedly the
objects of public veneration; if the people, overthrowing law, roared like a sea around the courts of justice, and demanded the blood of those who, during the temporary fit of insanity and drunken
delirium, had chanced to become odious to it, for true words manfully spoken, or unpopular acts bravely done, the Masonic juror, unawed alike by the single or the manyheaded tyrant, would consult
the dictates of duty alone, and stand with a noble firmness between the human tigers and their coveted prey.
The Mason would much rather pass his life hidden in the recesses of the deepest obscurity, feeding his
mind even with the visions and imaginations of good deeds and noble actions, than to be placed on the most splendid throne of the universe, tantalized with a denial of the practice of all which can make the
greatest situation any other than the greatest curse. And if he has been enabled to lend the slightest step to any great and laudable designs; if he has had any share in any measure giving quiet to private
property and to private conscience, making lighter the yoke of poverty and dependence, or relieving deserving men from oppression; if he has aided in securing to his countrymen that best possession,
peace; if he has joined in reconciling the different sections of his own country to each other, and the people to the government of their own creating; and in teaching the citizen to look for his protection to
the laws of his country, and for his comfort to the goodwill of his countrymen; if he has thus taken his part with the best of men in the best of their actions, he may well shut the book, even if he might wish
to read a page or two more. It is enough for his measure. He has not lived in vain.
Masonry teaches that all power is delegated for the good, and not for the injury of the People; and that, when it is perverted from the original purpose, the compact is broken, and the right ought to be
resumed; that resistance to power usurped is not merely a duty which man owes to himself and to his
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



123/641
neighbour, but a duty which he owes to his God, in asserting and maintaining the rank which He gave him in the creation. This principle neither the rudeness of ignorance can stifle nor the enervation of
refinement extinguish. It makes it base for a man to suffer when he ought to act; and, tending to preserve to him the original destinations of Providence, spurns at the arrogant assumptions of tyrants
and vindicates the independent quality of the race of which we are a part.
The wise and wellinformed Mason will not fail to be the votary of Liberty and Justice. He will be ready to exert himself in their defence, wherever they exist. It cannot be a matter of indifference to him
when, his own liberty and that of other men, with whose merits and capacities he is acquainted, are involved in the event of the struggle to be made; but his attachment will be to the cause, as the cause of
man; and not merely to the country. Wherever there is a people that understands the value of political justice, and is prepared to assert it, that is his country; wherever he can most contribute to the diffusion
of these principles and the real happiness of mankind, that is his country. Nor does he desire for any country any other benefit than justice.
The true Mason identifies the honour of his country with his own. Nothing more conduces to the
beauty and glory of one's country than the preservation against all enemies of its civil and religious liberty. The world will never willingly let die the names of those patriots who in her different ages have
received upon their own breasts the blows aimed by insolent enemies at the bosom of their country.
But also it conduces, and in no small measure, to the beauty and glory of one's country, that justice should always be administered there to all alike, and neither denied, sold, nor delayed to any one; that
the interest of the poor should be looked to, and none starve or be houseless, or clamor in vain for work; that the child and the feeble woman should not be overworked, or even the apprentice or slave be stinted
of food or overtasked or mercilessly scourged; and that God's great laws of mercy, humanity, and compassion should be everywhere enforced, not only by the statutes, but also by the power of public
opinion. And he who labours, often against reproach and obloquy, and oftener against indifference and apathy, to bring about that fortunate condition of things when that great code of divine law shall be
everywhere and punctually obeyed, is no less a patriot than he who bares his bosom to the hostile steel in the ranks of his country's soldiery.
For fortitude is not only seen resplendent on the field of battle and amid the clash of arms, but he
displays its energy under every difficulty and against every assailant. He who wars against cruelty, oppression, and hoary abuses, fights for his country's honour, which these things soil; and her honour is
as important as her existence. Often, indeed, the warfare against those abuses which disgrace one's country is quite as hazardous and more discouraging than that against her enemies in the field; and
merits equal, if not greater reward.

For those Greeks and Romans who are the objects of our admiration employed hardly any other virtue in the extirpation of tyrants, than that love of liberty, which made them prompt in seizing the sword,
and gave them strength to use it. With facility they accomplish the undertaking, amid the general shout of praise and joy; nor did they engage in the attempt so much as an enterprise of perilous and doubtful
issue, as a contest the most glorious in which virtue could be signalized; which infallibly led to present recompense; which bound their brows with wreaths of laurel, and consigned their memories to
immortal fame.
But he who assails hoary abuses, regarded perhaps with a superstitious reverence, and around which old laws stand as ramparts and bastions to defend them; who denounces acts of cruelty and outrage on
humanity which make every perpetrator thereof his personal enemy, and perhaps make him looked upon with suspicion by the people among whom he lives, as the assailant of an established order of
things of which he assails only the abuses, and of laws of which he attacks only the violations,he can scarcely look for present recompense, nor that his living brows will be wreathed with laurel. And if,
contending against a dark array of longreceived opinions, superstitions, obloquy, and fears, which most men dread more than they do an army terrible with banners, the Mason overcomes, and emerges from
the contest victorious; or if he does not conquer, but is borne down and swept away by the mighty current of prejudice, passion, and interest; in either case, the loftiness of spirit which he displays merits
for him more than a mediocrity of fame.
He has already lived too long who has survived the ruin of his country; and he who can enjoy life after such an event deserves not to have lived at all. Nor does he any more deserve to live who looks
contentedly upon abuses that disgrace, and cruelties that dishonour, and scenes of misery and destitution and brutalization that disfigure his country; or sordid meanness and ignoble revenges that
make her a byword and a scoff among all generous nations; and does not endeavour to remedy or prevent either.
Not often is a country at war; nor can every one be allowed the privilege of offering his heart to the
enemy's bullets. But in these patriotic labours of peace, in preventing, remedying, and reforming evils, oppressions, wrongs, cruelties, and outrages, every Mason can unite; and every one can effect
something, and share the honour and glory of the result.
For the cardinal names in the history of the human mind are few and easily to be counted up; but thousands and tens of thousands spend their days in the preparations which are to speed the predestined
change, in gathering and amassing the materials which are to kindle and give light and warmth, when the fire from heaven shall have descended on them. Numberless are the sutlers and pioneers, the
engineers and artisans, who attend the march of intellect. Many move forward in detachments, and level the way over which the chariot is to pass, and cut down the obstacles that would impede its progress;
and these too have their reward. If they labour diligently and faithfully in their calling, not only will

they enjoy that calm contentment which diligence in the lowliest task never fails to win; not only will the sweat of their brows be sweet, and the sweetener of the rest that follows; but, when the victory is at
last achieved, they will come in for a share in the glory; even as the meanest soldier who fought at Marathon or at King's Mountain became a sharer in the glory of those saving days; and within his own
household circle, the approbation of which approaches the nearest to that of an approving conscience, was looked upon as the representative of all his brotherheroes; and could tell such tales as made the
tear glisten on the cheek of his wife, and ]it up his boy'.s eyes with an unwonted sparkling eagerness. Or, if he fell in the fight, and his place by the fireside and at the table at home was thereafter vacant,
that place was sacred; and he was often talked of there in the long winter evenings; and his family was deemed fortunate in the neighbourhood, because it had had a hero in it, who had fallen in defence of his
country.
Remember that life's length is not measured by its hours and days but by that which we have done therein for our country and kind. A useless life is short. if it last a century; but that of Alexander was
long as the life of the oak, though he died at thirtyfive. We may do much in a few years, and we may nothing in a lifetime. If we but eat and drink and sleep, and everything go on around us as it pleases; or
if we live but amass wealth or gain office or wear titles, we might as well not have lived at all; nor have we any right to expect immortality.
Forget not, therefore, to what you have devoted yourself in this Degree: defend weakness against
strength, the friendless against the great, the oppressed against the oppressor! Be ever vigilant and watchful of the interests and honour of your country! and may the Grand Architect of the Universe give
you that strength and wisdom which shall enable you well and faithfully to perform these high duties!

[Elu of the Fifteen]
This degree is devoted to the same objects as those of the Elu of Nine; and also to the cause of Toleration and Liberality against Fanaticism and Persecution, political and religious; and to that of
Education, Instruction, and Enlightenment against Error, Barbarism, and Ignorance. To these
objects you have irrevocably and forever devoted your hand, your heart, and your intellect; and
whenever in your presence a Chapter of this Degree is opened, you will be most solemnly reminded of your vows here taken at the altar.
Toleration, holding that every other man has the same right to his opinion and faith that we have to
ours; and liberality, holding that as no human being can with certainty say, in the clash and conflict of

hostile faiths and creeds, what is truth, or that he is surely in possession of it, so every one should feel that it is quite possible that another equally honest and sincere with himself, and yet holding the
contrary opinion, may himself be in possession of the truth, and that whatever one firmly and conscientiously believes, is truth, to him these are the mortal enemies of that fanaticism which
persecutes for opinion's sake, and initiates crusades against whatever it, in its imaginary holiness, deems to be contrary to the law of God or verity of dogma. And education, instruction, and
enlightenment are the most certain means by which fanaticism and intolerance can be rendered powerless.
No true Mason scoffs at honest convictions and an ardent zeal in the cause of what one believes to be
truth and justice. But he does absolutely deny the right of any man to assume the prerogative of Deity, and condemn another's faith and opinions as deserving to be punished because heretical. Nor does he
approve the course of those who endanger the peace and quiet of great nations, and the best interest of their own race by indulging in a chimerical and visionary philanthropy a luxury which chiefly consists
in drawing their robes around them to avoid contact with their fellows, and proclaiming themselves holier than they. For he knows that such follies are often more calamitous than the ambition of kings;
and that intolerance and bigotry have been infinitely greater curses to mankind than ignorance and error. Better any error than persecution! Better any opinion than the thumbscrew, the rack, and the
stake! And he knows also how unspeakably absurd it is, for a creature to whom himself and everything around him are mysteries, to torture and slay others, because they cannot think as he does in regard to
the profoundest of those mysteries, to understand which is utterly beyond the comprehension of either the persecutor or the persecuted.
Masonry is not a religion. He who makes of it a religious belief, falsifies and denaturalizes it. The
Brahmin, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Catholic, the Protestant, each professing his peculiar religion, sanctioned by the laws, by time, and by climate, must needs retain it, and cannot have two religions; for
the social and sacred laws adapted to the usages, manners, and prejudices of particular countries, are the work of men. But Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old
primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundation of all religions. All that ever existed have had a basis of truth; and all have overlaid that truth with errors. The primitive truths taught by the Redeemer
were sooner corrupted, and intermingled and alloyed with fictions than when taught to the first of our race. Masonry is the universal morality which is suitable to the inhabitants of every clime, to the man
of every creed. It has taught no doctrines, except those truths that tend directly to the wellbeing of man; and those who have attempted to direct it toward useless vengeance, political ends, and Jesuitism,
have merely perverted it to purposes foreign to its pure spirit and real nature.
Mankind outgrows the sacrifices and the mythologies of the childhood of the world. Yet it is easy for human indolence to linger near these helps, and refuse to pass further on. So the unadventurous Nomad
in the Tartarian wild keeps his flock in the same closecropped circle where they first learned to browse, while the progressive man roves ever forth "to fresh fields and pastures new." The latter is the

true Mason; and the best and indeed the only good Mason is he who with the power of business does the work of life; the upright mechanic, merchant, or farmer, the man with the power of thought, of
justice, or of love, he whose whole life is one great act of performance of Masonic duty. The natural case of the strength of a strong man or the wisdom of a wise one, is to do the work of a strong man or a
wise one.
The natural work of Masonry is practical life; the use of all the faculties in their proper spheres, and for their natural function. Love of Truth, justice, and generosity as attributes of God, must appear in a life
marked by these qualities; that is the only effectual ordinance of Masonry. A profession of one's convictions, joining the Order, assuming the obligations, assisting at the ceremonies, are of the same
value in science as in Masonry; the natural form of Masonry is goodness, morality, living a true, just, affectionate, selffaithful life, from the motive of a good man. It is loyal obedience to God's law.
The good Mason does the good thing which comes in his way, and because it comes in his way; from a
love of duty, and not merely because a law, enacted by man or God, commands his will to do it. He is true to his mind, his conscience, heart, and soul, and feels small temptation to do to others what he
would not wish to receive from them. He will deny himself for the sake of his brother near at hand. His desire attracts in the line of his duty, both being in conjunction. Not in vain does the poor or the
oppressed look up to him. You find such men in all Christian sects, Protestant and Catholic, in all the great religious parties of the civilized world, among Buddhists, Mahometans, and Jews. They are kind
fathers, generous citizens, unimpeachable in their business, beautiful in their daily lives. You see their Masonry in their work and in their play. It appears in all the forms of their activity, individual,
domestic, social, ecclesiastical, or political. True Masonry within must be morality without. It must be come eminent morality, which is philanthropy. The true Mason loves not only his kindred and his
country, but all mankind; not only the good, but also the evil, among his brethren. He has more goodness than the channels of his daily life will hold. It runs over the banks, to water and to feed a
thousand thirsty plants. Not content with the duty that lies along his track, he goes out to seek it; not only willing, he has a salient longing to do good, to spread his truth, his justice, his generosity, his
Masonry over all the world. His daily life is a profession of his Masonry, published in perpetual good will to men. He can not be a persecutor. Not more naturally does the beaver build or the mockingbird
sing his own wild, gushing melody, than the true Mason lives in this beautiful outward life. So from the perennial spring swells forth the stream, to quicken the meadow with new access of green, and perfect
beauty bursting into bloom. Thus Masonry does the work it was meant to do. The Mason does not sigh and weep, and make grimaces. He lives right on. If his life is, as whose is not, marked with errors, and
with sins, he ploughs over the barren spot with his remorse, sows with new seed, and the old desert blossoms like a rose. He is not confined to set forms of thought, of action, or of feeling. He accepts
what his mind regards as true, what his conscience decides is right, what his heart deems generous and noble; and all else he puts far from him. Though the ancient and the honorable of the Earth bid him
bow down to them, his stubborn knees bend only at the bidding of his manly soul. His Masonry is his freedom before God, not his bondage unto men. His mind acts after the universal law of the intellect,
his conscience according to the universal moral law, his affections and his soul after the universal law

of each, and so he is strong with the strength of God, in this fourfold way communicating with Him.
The old theologies, the philosophies of religion of ancient times, will not suffice us now. The duties of life are to be done; we are to do them, consciously obedient to the law of God, not atheistically, loving
only our selfish gain. There are sins of trade to be corrected. Everywhere morality and philanthropy are needed. There are errors to be made way with, and their place supplied with new truths, radiant with
the glories of Heaven.
There are great wrongs and evils, in Church and State, in domestic, social, and public life, to be righted and outgrown. Masonry cannot in our age forsake the broad way of life. She must journey on in the
open street, appear in the crowded square, and teach men by her deeds, her life more eloquent than any lips.
This Degree is chiefly devoted to TOLERATION; and it inculcates in the strongest manner that great
leading idea of the Ancient Art, that a belief in the one True God, and a moral and virtuous life, constitute the only religious requisites needed to enable a man to be a Mason.
Masonry has ever the most vivid remembrance of the terrible and artificial torments that were used to
put down new forms of religion or extinguish the old. It sees with the eye of memory the ruthless extermination of all the people of all sexes and ages, because it was their misfortune not to know the
God of the Hebrews, or to worship Him under the wrong name, by the savage troops of Moses and Joshua. It sees the thumbscrews and the racks, the whip, the gallows, and the stake, the victims of
Diocletian and Alva, the miserable Covenanters, the NonConformists, Servetus burned, and the unoffending Quaker hung. It sees Cranmer hold his arm, now no longer erring, in the flame until the
hand drops off in the consuming heat. It sees the persecutions of Peter and Paul, the martyrdom of
Stephen, the trials of Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin, and Iren�us; and then in turn the sufferings of the
wretched Pagans under the Christian Emperors, as of the Papists in Ireland and under Elizabeth and the bloated Henry. The Roman Virgin naked before the hungry lions; young Margaret Graham tied to a
stake at lowwater mark, and there left to drown, singing hymns to God until the savage waters broke over her head; and all that in all ages have suffered by hunger and nakedness, peril and prison, the rack,
the stake, and the sword, it sees them all, and shudders at the long roll of human atrocities. And it sees also the oppression still practised in the name of religion men shot in a Christian jail in Christian Italy
for reading the Christian Bible; in almost every Christian State, laws forbidding freedom of speech on matters relating to Christianity; and the gallows reaching its arm over the pulpit.
The fires of Moloch in Syria, the harsh mutilations in the name of Astarte, Cybele, Jehovah; the
barbarities of imperial Pagan Torturers; the still grosser torments which RomanGothic Christians in Italy and Spain heaped on their brothermen; the fiendish cruelties to which Switzerland, France, the

Netherlands, England, Scotland, Ireland, America, have been witnesses, are none too powerful to warn man of the unspeakable evils which follow from mistakes and errors in the matter of religion, and
especially from investing the God of Love with the cruel and vindictive passions of erring humanity, and making blood to have a sweet savor in his nostrils, and groans of agony to be delicious to his ears.
Man never had the right to usurp the unexercised prerogative of God, and condemn and punish another
for his belief. Born in a Protestant land, we are of that faith. If we had opened our eyes to the light under the shadows of St. Peter's at Rome, we should have been devout Catholics; born in the Jewish
quarter of Aleppo, we should have contemned Christ as an imposter; in Constantinople, we should have cried "Allah il Allah, God is great and Mahomet is his prophet!" Birth, place, and education give us
our faith. Few believe in any religion because they have examined the evidences of its authenticity, and made up a formal judgment, upon weighing the testimony. Not one man in ten thousand knows
anything about the proofs of his faith. We believe what we are taught; and those are most fanatical who know least of the evidences on which their creed is based. Facts and testimony are not, except in very
rare instances, the groundwork of faith. It is an imperative law of God's Economy, unyielding and inflexible as Himself, that man shall accept without question the belief of those among whom he is
born and reared; the faith so made a part of his nature resists all evidence to the contrary; and he will disbelieve even the evidence of his own senses, rather than yield up the religious belief which has
grown up in him, flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone.
What is truth to me is not truth to another. The same arguments and evidences that convince one mind make no impression on another. This difference is in men at their birth. No man is entitled positively to
assert that he is right, where other men, equally intelligent and equally well informed, hold directly the opposite opinion. Each thinks it impossible for the other 'to be sincere, and each, as to that, is equally in
error. "What is truth?" was a profound question, the most suggestive one ever put to man.
Many beliefs of former and present times seem incomprehensible. They startle us with a new glimpse into the human soul, that mysterious thing more mysterious the more we note its workings. Here is a
man superior to myself in intellect and learning; and yet he sincerely believes what seems to me too absurd to merit confutation; and I cannot conceive, and sincerely do not believe,that he is both sane and
honest.
And yet he is both. His reason is as perfect as mine, and he is as honest as I. The fancies of a lunatic are realities, to him. Our dreams are realities while they last; and, in the Past, no more unreal than what we
have acted in our waking hours. No man can say that he hath as sure possession of the truth as of a chattel. When men entertain opinions diametrically opposed to each other, and each is honest, who
shall decide which hath the Truth; and how can either say with certainty that he hath it? We know not what is the truth. That we ourselves believe and feel absolutely certain that our own belief is true, is in
reality not the slightest proof of the fact, seem it never so certain and incapable of doubt to us. No man

is responsible for the rightness of his faith; but only for the uprightness of it.
Therefore no man hath or ever had a right to persecute another for his belief; for there cannot be two antagonistic rights; and if one can persecute another, because he himself is satisfied that the belief of
that other is erroneous, the other has, for the same reason, equally as certain
a right to persecute him.
The truth comes to us tinged and colored with our prejudices and our preconceptions, which are as old
as ourselves, and strong with a divine force. It comes to us as the image of a rod comes to us through the water, bent and distorted. An argument sinks into and convinces the mind of one man, while from
that of another it rebounds like a ball of ivory dropped on marble. It is no merit in a man to have a particular faith, excellent and sound and philosophic as it may be, when he imbibed it with his mother's
milk. It is no more a merit than his prejudices and his passions.
The sincere Moslem has as much right to persecute us, as we to persecute him; and therefore Masonry wisely requires no more than a belief in One Great AllPowerful Deity, the Father and Preserver of the
Universe. Therefore it is she teaches her votaries that toleration is one of the chief duties of every good Mason, a component part of that charity without which we are mere hollow images of true Masons,
mere sounding brass and tinkling cymbals.
No evil hath so afflicted the world as intolerance of religious opinion. The human beings it has slain in various ways, if once and together brought to life, would make a nation of people; left to live and
increase, would have doubled the population of the civilized portion of the globe; among which civilized portion it chiefly is that religious wars are waged.
The treasure and the human labor thus lost would have made the earth a garden, in which, but for his
evil passions, man might now be as happy as in Eden.
No man truly obeys the Masonic law who merely tolerates those whose religious opinions are opposed to his own. Every man's opinions are his own private property, and the rights of all men to maintain
each his own are perfectly equal. Merely to tolerate, to bear with an opposing opinion, is to assume it to be heretical; and assert the right to persecute, if we would; and claim our toleration of it as a merit. The
Mason's creed goes further than that. No man, it holds, has any right in any way to, interfere with the religious belief of another. It holds that each mat] is absolutely sovereign as to his own belief, and that
belief is a matter absolutely foreign to all who do not entertain the same belief; and that, if there were any right of persecution at all, it would in all cases be a mutual right; because one party has the same
right as the other to sit as judge in his own case; and God is the only magistrate that can rightfully

decide between them. To 1hat great judge, Masonry refers the matter; and opening wide its portals, it invites to enter there and live in peace and harmony, the Protestant, the Catholic, the Jew, the Moslem;
every man who will lead a truly virtuous and moral life, love his brethren, sinister to the sick and distressed, and believe in the ONE, All Powerful, AllWise, everywhere Present GOD, Architect,
Creator, and Preserver of all things, by whose universal law of Harmony ever rolls on this universe, the great, vast, infinite circle of successive Death and Life: to whose INEFFABLE NAME let all true
Masons pay profoundest homage! for whose thousand blessings poured upon us, let us feel the sincerest gratitude, now, henceforth, and forever!
We may well be tolerant of each other's creed; for in every faith there are excellent moral precepts. Far
in the South of Asia, Zoroaster taught this doctrine: "On commencing a journey, the Faithful should turn his thoughts toward Ormuzd, and confess him, in the purity of his heart, to be King of the World;
he should love him, do him homage, and serve him. He must be upright and charitable, despise the pleasures of the body, and avoid pride and haughtiness, and vice in all its forms, and especially
'falsehood, one of the basest sins of which man can be guilty. He must forget injuries and not avenge himself. He must honor the memory of his parents and relatives. At night, before retiring to sleep, he
should rigorously examine his conscience, and repent of the faults which weakness or illfortune had caused him to commit." He was required to pray for strength to persevere in the Good, and to obtain
forgiveness for his errors. It was his duty to confess his faults to a Magus, or to a layman renowned for his virtues, or to the Sun. Fasting and maceration were prohibited; and, on the contrary, it was his duty
suitably to nourish the body and to maintain its vigor, that his soul might be strong to resist the Genius of Darkness; that he might more attentively read the Divine Word, and have more courage to perform
noble deeds.
And in the North of Europe the Druids taught devotion to friends, indulgence for reciprocal wrongs, love of deserved praise, prudence, humanity, hospitality, respect for old age, disregard of the future,
temperance, contempt of death, and a chivalrous deference to woman.
Listen to these maxims from the Hava Maal, or Sublime Book of Odin: "If thou hast a friend, visit him often; the path will grow over with grass, and the trees soon cover it, if thou dost not constantly walk
upon it. He is a faithful friend, who, having but two loaves, gives his friend one. Be never first to break with thy friend; sorrow wrings the heart of him who has no one save himself with whom to take
counsel. There is no virtuous man who has not some vice, no bad man who has not some virtue. Happy he who obtains the praise and goodwill of men; for all that depends on the will of another is hazardous
and uncertain. Riches flit away in the twinkling of an eye; they are the most inconstant of friends; flocks and herds perish, parents die, friends are not immortal, thou thyself diest; I know but one thing
that doth not die, the judgment that is passed upon the dead. Be humane toward those whom thou meetest on the road. If the guest that cometh to thy house is a cold, give him fire; the man who has
journeyed over the mountains needs food and dry garments. Mock not at the aged; for words full of sense come often from the wrinkles of age. Be moderately wise, and not overprudent. Let no one seek

to know his destiny, if he would sleep tranquilly. There is no malady more cruel than to be discontented with our lot. The glutton eats his own death; and the wise man laughs at the fool's greediness. Nothing
is more injurious to the young than excessive drinking; the more one drinks the more he loses his reason; the bird of forgetfulness sings before those who intoxicate themselves, and wiles away their
souls. Man devoid of sense believes he will live always if he avoids war; but, if the lances spare him, old age will give him no quarter. Better live well than live long. When a man lights a fire in his house,
death comes before it goes out." And thus said the Indian books: "Honor thy father and mother. Never forget the benefits thou hast received. Learn while thou art young. Be submissive to the laws of thy
country. Seek the company of virtuous men. Speak not of God but with respect. Live on good terms with thy fellowcitizens. Remain in thy proper place. Speak ill of no one. Mock at the bodily infirmities
of none. Pursue not unrelentingly a conquered enemy. Strive to acquire a good reputation. Take counsel with wise men.
The more one learns, the more he acquires the faculty of learning, Knowledge is the most permanent
wealth. As well be dumb as ignorant. The true use of knowledge is to distinguish good from evil. Be not a subject of shame to thy parents. What one learns in youth endures like the engraving upon a rock. He
is wise who knows himself. Let thy books be thy best friends. When thou attainest an hundred years, cease to learn. Wisdom is solidly planted, even on the shifting ocean. Deceive no one, not even thine
enemy. Wisdom is a treasure that everywhere commands its value. Speak mildly, even to the poor. It is sweeter to forgive than to take vengeance. Gaming and quarrels lead to misery. There is no true merit
without the practice of virtue. To honor our mother is the most fitting homage we can pay the Divinity. There is no tranquil sleep without a clear conscience. He badly understands his interest who breaks his
word."
Twentyfour centuries ago these were the Chinese Ethics: "The Philosopher [Confucius] said, 'SAN! my doctrine is simple, and easy to be understood.' THSENGTSEU replied, 'that is certain.' The
Philosopher having gone out, the disciples asked what their master had meant to say. THSENGTSEU responded, 'The doctrine of our Master consists solely in being upright of heart, and loving our
neighbor as we love ourself."
About a century later, the Hebrew law said, "If any man hate his neighbor then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother. Better is a neighbor that is near, than a brother afar off. Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
In the same fifth century before Christ, SOCRATES the Grecian said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Three generations earlier, ZOROASTER had said to the Persians: "Offer up thy grateful
prayers to the Lord, the most just and pure Ormuzd, the supreme and adorable God, who thus declared to his Prophet Zerdusht: 'Hold it not meet to do unto others what thou wouldst not desire done unto
thyself; do that unto the people, which, when done to thyself, is not disagreeable unto thee."'

The same doctrine had been long taught in the schools of Babylon, Alexandria, and Jerusalem. A Pagan
declared to the Pharisee HILLEL that he was ready to embrace the Jewish religion, if he could make known to him in a few words a summary of the whole law of Moses. "That which thou likest not done
to thyself," said Hillel, "do it not unto thy neighbor.
Therein is all the law: the rest is nothing but the commentary upon it." "Nothing is more natural," said CONFUCIUS, "nothing more simple, than the principles of that morality which I endeavor, by salutary
maxims, to inculcate in you. It is humanity; which is to say, that universal charity among all of our species, without distinction. It is uprightness; that is, that rectitude of spirit and of heart, which make;
one seek for truth in everything, and desire it, without deceiving one's self or others. It is, finally, sincerity or good faith; which is to say, that frankness, that openness of heart, tempered by selfreliance,
which excludes all feints and all disguising, as much in speech as in action."
To diffuse useful information, to further intellectual refinement, sure forerunner of moral improvement, to hasten the coming of the great day, when the dawn of general knowledge shalt, chase away the lazy,
lingering mists of ignorance and error, even from the base of the great social pyramid, is indeed a high calling, in which the most splendid talents and consummate virtue may well press onward, eager to bear
a part. From the Masonic ranks ought to go forth those whose genius and not their ancestry ennoble them, to open to all ranks the temple of science, and by their own example to make the humblest men
emulous to climb steps no longer inaccessible, and enter the unfolded gates burning in the sun.
The highest intellectual cultivation is perfectly compatible with the daily cares and toils of working men. A keen relish for the most sublime truths of science belongs alike to every class of Mankind. And,
as philosophy was taught in the sacred groves of Athens, and under the Portico, and in the old Temples of Egypt and India, so in our Lodges ought Knowledge to be dispensed, the Sciences taught, and the
Lectures become like the teachings of Socrates and Plato, of Agassiz and Cousin.
Real knowledge never permitted either turbulence or unbelief; but its progress is the forerunner of liberality and enlightened toleration. Whoso dreads these may well tremble; for he may be well assured
that their day is at length come, and must put to speedy flight the evil spirits of tyranny and persecution, which haunted the long night now gone down the sky.
And it is to be hoped that the time will soon arrive, when, as men will no longer suffer themselves to be
led blindfolded in ignorance, so will they no more yield to the vile principle of judging and treating their fellow creatures, not according to the intrinsic merit of their actions, but according to the
accidental and involuntary coincidence of their opinions.

Whenever we come to treat with entire respect those who conscientiously differ from ourselves, the only practical effect of a difference will be, to make us enlighten the ignorance on one side or the other,
from which it springs, by instructing them, if it be theirs; ourselves, if it be our own; to the end that the only kind of unanimity may be produced which is desirable among rational beings, the agreement
proceeding from full conviction after the freest discussion.
The Elu of Fifteen ought therefore to take the lead of his fellowcitizen, not in frivolous amusements, not in the degrading pursuits of the ambitious vulgar; but in the truly noble task of enlightening the
mass of his countrymen, and of leaving his own name encircled, not with barbaric splendor, or attached to courtly gewgaws, but illustrated by the honors most worthy of our rational nature; coupled with the
diffusion of knowledge, and gratefully pronounced by a few, at least, whom his wise beneficence has rescued from ignorance and vice. We say to him, in the words of the great Roman: "Men in no respect
so nearly approach to the Deity, as when they confer benefits on men. To serve and do good to as many as possible, there is nothing greater in your fortune than that you should be able, and nothing finer in
your nature, than that you should be desirous to do this." This is the true mark for the aim of every man and Mason who either prizes the enjoyment of pure happiness, or sets a right value upon a high and
unsullied renown. And if the benefactors of mankind, when they rest from their noble labors, shall be permitted to enjoy hereafter, as an appropriate reward of their virtue, the privilege of looking down
upon the blessings with which their exertions and charities, and perhaps their toils and sufferings have clothed the scene of their former existence, it will not, in a state of exalted purity and wisdom, be the
founders of mighty dynasties, the conquerors of new empires, the C�sars, Alexanders, and Tamerlanes; nor the mere Kings and Counsellors, Presidents and Senators, who have lived for their
party chiefly, and for their country only incidentally, often sacrificing to their own aggrandizement or that of their faction the good of their fellow creatures; it will not be they who will be gratified by
contemplating the monuments of their inglorious fame; but those will enjoy that delight and march in that triumph, who can trace the remote effects of their enlightened benevolence in the improved
condition of their species, and exult in the reflection, that the change which they at last, perhaps after many years, survey, with eyes that age and sorrow can make dim no more, of Knowledge become
Power, Virtue sharing that Empire, Superstition dethroned, and Tyranny exiled, is, if even only in some small and very slight degree, yet still in some degree, the fruit, precious if costly, and though late repaid
yet long enduring, of their own selfdenial and strenuous exertion, of their own mite of charity and aid to education wisely bestowed, and of the hardships and hazards which they encountered here below.
Masonry requires of its Initiates and votaries nothing that is impracticable. It does not demand that they
should undertake to climb to those lofty and sublime peaks of a theoretical and imaginary unpractical virtue, high and cold and remote as the eternal snows that wrap the shoulders of Chimborazo, and at
least as inaccessible as they. It asks that alone to be done which is easy to be done. It overtasks no one's strength, and asks no one to go beyond his means and capacities. It does not expect one whose business
or profession yields him little more than the wants of himself and his family require, and whose time is necessarily occupied by his daily vocations, to abandon or neglect the business by which he and his
children live, and devote himself and his means to the diffusion of knowledge among men. It does not

expect him to publish books for the people, or to lecture, to the ruin of his private affairs, or to found academies and colleges, build up libraries, and entitle himself to statues.
But it does require and expect every man of us to do something, within and according to his means; and
there is no Mason who cannot do some thing, if not alone, then by combination and association.
If a Lodge cannot aid in founding a school or an academy it can still do something. It can educate one boy or girl, at least, the child of some poor or departed brother. And it should never be forgotten, that in
the poorest unregarded child that seems abandoned to ignorance and vice may slumber the virtues of a Socrates, the intellect of a Bacon or a Bossuet, the genius of a Shakespeare, the capacity to benefit
mankind of a Washington; and that in rescuing him from the mire in which he is plunged, and giving him the means of education and development, the Lodge that does it may be the direct and immediate
means of conferring upon the world as great a boon as that given it by John Faust the boy of Mentz; may perpetuate the liberties of a country and change the destinies of nations, and write a new chapter in
the history of the world.
For we never know the importance of the act we do. The daughter of Pharaoh little thought what she was doing for the human race, and the vast unimaginable consequences that depended on her charitable
act, when she drew the little child of a Hebrew woman from among the rushes that grew along the bank of the Nile, and determined to rear it as if it were her own.
How often has an act of charity, costing the doer little, given to the world a great painter, a great
musician, a great inventor! How often has such an act developed the ragged boy into the benefactor of his race! On what small and apparently unimportant circumstances have turned and hinged, the fates of
the world's great conquerors. There is no law that limits the returns that shall be reaped from a single good deed. The widow's mite may not only be as acceptable to God, but may produce as great results as
the rich man's costly offering. The poorest boy, helped by benevolence, may come to lead armies, to control senates, to decide an peace and war, to dictate to cabinets; and his magnificent thoughts and
noble words may be law many years hereafter to millions of men yet unborn.
But the opportunity to effect a great good does not often occur to any one. It is worse than folly for one to lie idle and inert, and expect the accident to befall him, by which his influences shall live forever. He
can expect that to happen, only in consequence of one or many or all of a long series of acts.
He can expect to benefit the world only as men attain other results; by continuance, by persistence, by a steady and uniform habit of laboring for the enlightenment of the world, to the extent of his means and
capacity.

For it is, in all instances, by steady labor, by giving enough of application to our work, and having
enough of time for the doing of it, by regular painstaking, and the plying of constant assiduities, and not by any process of legerdemain, that we secure the strength and the staple of real excellence. It was
thus that Demosthenes, clause after clause, and sentence after sentence, elaborated to the uttermost his immortal orations. It was thus that Newton pioneered his way, by the steps of an ascending geometry, to
the mechanism of the Heavens, and Le Verrier added a planet to our Solar System.
It is a most erroneous opinion that those who have left the most stupendous monuments of intellect behind them, were not differently exercised from the rest of the species, but only differently gifted; that
they signalized themselves only by their talent, and hardly ever by their industry; for it is in truth to the most strenuous application of those commonplace faculties which are diffused among all, that they are
indebted for the glories which now encircle their remembrance and their name.
We must not imagine it to be a vulgarizing of genius, that it should be lighted up in any other way than by a direct inspiration from Heaven nor overlook the steadfastness of purpose, the devotion to some
single but great object, the unweariedness of labor that is given, not in convulsive and preternatural throes, but by little and little as the strength of the mind may bear it; the accumulation of many small
efforts, instead of a few grand and gigantic, but perhaps irregular movements, on the part of energies that are marvellous; by which former alone the great results are brought out that write their enduring
records on the face of the earth and in the history of nations and of man.
We must not overlook these elements, to which genius owes the best and proudest of her achievements; nor imagine that qualities so generally possessed as patience and painstaking, and resolute industry,
have no share in upholding a distinction so illustrious as that of the benefactor of his kind.
We must not forget that great results are most ordinarily produced by an aggregate of many contributions and exertions; as it is the invisible particles of vapor, each separate and distinct from the
other, that, rising from the oceans and their bays and gulfs, from lakes and rivers, and wide morasses and overflowed plains, float away as clouds, and distill upon the earth in dews, and fall in showers and
rain and snows upon the broad plains and rude mountains, and make the great navigable streams that are the arteries along which flows the lifeblood of a country.
And so Masonry can do much, if each Mason be content to do his share, and if their united efforts are
directed by wise counsels to a common purpose. "It is for God and for Omnipotency to do mighty things in a moment; but by degrees to grow to greatness is the course that He hath left for man."

If Masonry will but be true to her mission, and Masons to their promises and obligations if, re entering vigorously upon a career of beneficence, she and they will but pursue it earnestly and
unfalteringly, remembering that our contributions to the cause of charity and education then deserve the greatest credit when it costs us something, the curtailing of a comfort or the relinquishment of a luxury,
to make them if we will but give aid to what were once Masonry's great schemes for human improvement, not fitfully and spasmodically, but regularly and incessantly, as the vapors rise and the
springs run, and as the sun rises and the stars come up into the heavens, then we may be sure that great results will be attained and a great work done. And then it will most surely be seen that Masonry is not
effete or impotent, nor degenerated nor drooping to a fatal decay.
XI. SUBLIME ELECT OF THE TWELVE or PRINCE AMETH
[Elu of the Twelve]
The duties of a Prince Ameth are, to be earnest, true, reliable, and sincere; to protect the people against illegal impositions and exactions; to contend for their political rights, and to see, as far as he may or
can, that those bear the burdens who reap the benefits of the Government.
You are to be true unto all men.
You are to be frank and sincere in all things.
You are to be earnest in doing whatever it is your duty to do.
And no man must repent that he has relied upon your resolve, your profession, or your word.
The great distinguishing characteristic of a Mason is sympathy with his kind. He recognizes in the human race one great family, all connected with himself by those invisible links, and that mighty net
work of circumstance, forged and woven by God.
Feeling that sympathy, it is his first Masonic duty to serve his fellowman.
At his first entrance into the Order, he ceases to be isolated, and becomes one of a great brotherhood, assuming now duties toward every Mason that lives, as every Mason at the same moment assumes them
toward him.

Nor are those duties on his part confined to Masons alone. He assumes many in regard to his country, and especially toward the great, suffering masses of the common people; for they too are his brethren,
and God hears them, inarticulate as the moanings of their misery are. By all proper means, of persuasion and influence, and otherwise, if the occasion and emergency require, he is bound to defend
them against oppression, and tyrannical and illegal exactions. He labors equally to defend and to improve the people. He does not flatter them to mislead them, nor fawn upon them to rule them, nor
conceal his opinions to humor them, nor tell them that they can never err, and that their voice is the voice of God. He knows that the safety of every free government, and its continuance and perpetuity
depend upon the virtue and intelligence of the common people; and that, unless their liberty is of such a kind as arms can neither procure nor take away; unless it is the fruit of manly courage, of justice,
temperance, and generous virtue unless, being such, it has taken deep root in the minds and hearts of the people at large, there will not long be wanting those who will snatch from them by treachery what
they have acquired by arms or institutions.
He knows that if, after being released from the toils of war, the people neglect the arts of peace; if their peace and liberty be a state of warfare; if war be their only virtue, and the summit of their praise, they
will soon find peace the most adverse to their interests. It will be only a more distressing war; and that which they imagined liberty will be the worst of slavery. For, unless by the means of knowledge and
morality, not frothy and loquacious, but genuine, unadulterated, and sincere, they clear the horizon of the mind from those mists of error and passion which arise from ignorance and vice, they will always
have those who will bend their necks to the yoke as if they were brutes; who, notwithstanding all their triumphs, will put them up to the highest bidder, as if they were mere booty made in war; and find an
exuberant source of wealth and power, in the people's ignorance, prejudice, and passions.
The people that does not subjugate the propensity of the wealthy to avarice, ambition, and sensuality, expel luxury from them and their families, keep down pauperism, diffuse knowledge among the poor,
and labor to raise the abject from the mire of vice and low indulgence, and to keep the industrious from starving in sight of luxurious festivals, will find that it has cherished, in that avarice, ambition,
sensuality, selfishness, and luxury of the one class, and that degradation, misery, drunkenness, ignorance, and brutalization of the other, more stubborn and intractable despots at home than it ever
encountered in the field; and even its very bowels will be continually teeming with the intolerable progeny of tyrants.
These are the first enemies to be subdued; this constitutes the campaign of Peace; these are triumphs,
difficult indeed, but bloodless; and far more honorable than those trophies which are purchased only by slaughter and rapine; and if not victors in this service, it is in vain to have been victorious over the
despotic enemy in the field.
For if any people thinks that it is a grander; a more beneficial, or a wiser policy, to invent subtle

expedients by stamps and imposts, for increasing the revenue and draining the lifeblood of an impoverished people; to multiply its naval and military force; to rival in craft the ambassadors of
foreign states; to plot the swallowing up of foreign territory; to make crafty treaties and alliances; to rule prostrate states and abject provinces by fear and force; than to administer unpolluted justice to the
people, to relieve the condition and raise the estate of the toiling masses, redress the injured and succor the distressed and conciliate the discontented, and speedily restore to every one his own; then that
people is involved in a cloud of error, and will too late perceive, when the illusion of these mighty benefits has vanished, that in neglecting these, which it thought inferior considerations, it has only been
precipitating its own ruin and despair.
Unfortunately, every age presents its own special problem, most difficult and often impossible to solve; and that which this age offers, and forces upon the consideration of all chinking men, is this how, in a
populous and wealthy country, blessed with free institutions and a constitutional government, are the great masses of the manuallabor class to be enabled to have steady work at fair wages, to be kept from
starvation, and their children from vice and debauchery, and to be furnished with that degree, not of mere reading and writing, but of knowledge, that shall fit them intelligently to do the duties and
exercise the privileges of freemen; even to be intrusted with the dangerous right of suffrage?
For though we do not know why God, being infinitely merciful as well as wise, has so ordered it, it seems to be unquestionably his law, that even in civilized and Christian countries, the large mass of the
population shall be fortunate, if, during their whole life, from infancy to old age, in health and sickness, they have enough of the commonest and coarsest food to keep themselves and their children from the
continual gnawing of hunger enough of the commonest and coarsest clothing to protect themselves and their little ones from indecent exposure and the bitter cold; and if they have over their heads the
rudest shelter.
And He seems to have enacted this law which no human community has yet found the means to abrogate that when a country becomes populous, capital shall concentrate in the hands of a limited
number of persons, and labor become more and more at its mercy, until mere manual labor, that of the weaver and ironworker, and other artisans, eventually ceases to be worth more than a bare subsistence,
and often, in great cities and vast extents of country not even that, and goes or crawls about in rags, begging, and starving for want of work.
While every ox and horse can find work, and is worth being fed, it is not always so with man. To be
employed, to have a chance to work at anything like fair wages, becomes the great engrossing object of a man's life. The capitalist can live without employing the laborer, and discharges him whenever that
labor ceases to be profitable. At the moment when the weather is most inclement, provisions dearest, and rents highest, he turns him off to starve. If the daylaborer is taken sick, his wages stop. When old,
he has no pension to retire upon. His children cannot be sent to school; for before their bones are

hardened they must get to work lest they starve. The man, strong and ablebodied, works for a shilling or two a day, and the woman shivering over her little pan of coals, when the mercury drops far below
zero, after her hungry children have wailed themselves to sleep, sews by the dim light of her lonely candle, for a bare pittance, selling her life to him who bargained only for the work of her needle.
Fathers and mothers slay their children, to have the burialfees, that with the price of one child's life
they may continue life in those that survive.
Little girls with bare feet sweep the streetcrossings, when the winter wind pinches them, and beg piteously for pennies of those who wear warm furs. Children grow up in squalid misery and brutal
ignorance; want compels virgin and wife to prostitute themselves; women starve and freeze, and lean up against the walls of workhouses, like bundles of foul rags, all night long, and night after night, when the
cold rain falls, and there chances to be no room for them within; and hundreds of families are crowded into a single building, rife with horrors and teeming with foul air and pestilence; where men, women
and children huddle together in their filth; all ages and all colors sleeping indiscriminately together; while, in a great, free, Republican State, in the full vigor of its youth and strength, one person in every
seventeen is a pauper receiving charity.
How to deal with this apparently inevitable evil and mortal disease is by far the most important of all social problems. What is to be done with pauperism and oversupply of labor? How is the life of any
country to last, when brutality and drunken semibarbarism vote, and hold offices in their gift, and by fit representatives of themselves control a government? How, if not wisdom and authority, but
turbulence and low vice are to exalt to senatorships miscreants reeking with the odors and pollution of the hell, the prizering, the brothel, and the stockexchange, where gambling is legalized and rascality is
laudable?
Masonry will do all in its power, by direct exertion and cooperation, to improve and inform as well as to protect the people; to better their physical condition, relieve their miseries, supply their wants, and
minister to their necessities. Let every Mason in this good work do all that may be in his power.
For it is true now, as it always was and always will be, that to be free is the same thing as to be pious, to be wise, to be temperate and just, to be frugal and abstinent, and to be magnanimous and brave; and to
be the opposite of all these is the same as to be a slave. And it usually happens, by the appointment, and, as it were, retributive justice of the Deity, that that people which cannot govern themselves, and
moderate their passions, but crouch under the slavery of their lusts and vices, are delivered up to the sway of those whom they abhor, and made to submit to an involuntary servitude.
And it is also sanctioned by the dictates of justice and by the constitution of Nature, that he who, from

the imbecility or derangement of his intellect, is incapable of governing himself, should, like a minor, be committed to the government of another.
Above all things let us never forget that mankind constitutes one great brotherhood; all born to
encounter suffering and sorrow, and therefore bound to sympathize with each other.
For no tower of Pride was ever yet high enough to lift its possessor above the trials and fears and frailities of humanity. No human hand ever built the wall, nor ever shall, that will keep out affliction,
pain, and infirmity. Sickness and sorrow, trouble and death, are dispensations that level everything. They know none, high nor low. The chief wants of life, the great and grave necessities of the human
soul, give exemption to none. They make all poor, all weak. They put supplication in the mouth of every human being, as truly as in that of the meanest beggar.
But the principle of misery is not an evil principle. We err, and the consequences teach us wisdom. All
elements, all the laws of things around us, minister to this end; and through the paths of painful error and mistake, it is the design of Providence to lead us to truth and happiness. If erring only taught us to
err; if mistakes confirmed us in imprudence; if the miseries caused by vicious indulgence had a natural tendency to make us more abject slaves of vice, then suffering would be wholly evil. But, on the
contrary, all tends and is designed to produce amendment and improvement. Suffering is the discipline of virtue; of that which is infinitely better than happiness, and yet embraces in itself all essential
happiness.
It nourishes, invigorates, and perfects it. Virtue is the prize of the severelycontested race and hard fought battle; and it is worth all the fatigue and wounds of the conflict. Man should go forth with a
brave and strong heart, to battle with calamity. He is to master it, and not let it become his master. He is not to forsake the post of trial and of peril; but to stand firmly in his lot, until the great word of
Providence shall bid him fly, or bid him sink. With resolution and courage the Mason is to do the work which it is appointed for him to do, looking through the dark cloud of human calamity, to the end that
rises high and bright before him. The lot of sorrow is great and sublime. None suffer forever, nor for nought, nor without purpose. It is the ordinance of God's wisdom, and of His Infinite Love, to procure
for us infinite happiness and glory.
Virtue is the truest liberty; nor is he free who stoops to passions; nor he in bondage who serves a noble master. Examples are the best and most lasting lectures; virtue the best example. He that hath done
good deeds and set good precedents, in sincerity, is happy. Time shall not outlive his worth. He lives truly after death, whose good deeds are his pillars of remembrance; and no day but adds some grains to
his heap of glory.

Good works are seeds, that after sowing return us a continual harvest; and the memory of noble actions is more enduring than monuments of marble.
Life is a school. The world is neither prison nor penitentiary, nor a palace of ease, nor an amphitheatre
for games and spectacles; but a place of instruction, and discipline. Life is given for moral and spiritual training; and the entire course of the great school of life is an education for virtue, happiness, and a
future existence. The periods of Life are its terms; all human conditions, its forms; all human employments, its lessons. Families are the primary departments of this moral education; the various
circles of society, its advanced stages; Kingdoms and Republics, its universities.
Riches and Poverty, Gayeties and Sorrows, Marriages and Funerals, the ties of life bound or broken, fit and fortunate, or untoward and painful, are all lessons. Events are not blindly and carelessly flung
together.
Providence does not school one man, and screen another from the fiery trial of its lessons. It has neither rich favorites nor poor victims. One event happeneth to all. One end and one design concern and urge
all men.
The prosperous man has been at school. Perhaps he has thought that it was a great thing, and he a great personage; but he has been merely a pupil. He thought, perhaps, that he was Master, and had nothing to
do, but to direct and command; but there was ever a Master above him, the Master of Life. He looks not at our splendid state, or our many pretensions, nor at the aids and appliances of our learning; but at our
learning itself. He puts the poor and the rich upon the same form; and knows no difference between them, but their progress.
If from prosperity we have learned moderation, temperance, candor, modesty, gratitude to God, and
generosity to man, then we are entitled to be honored and rewarded. If we have learned selfishness, selfindulgence, wrongdoing, and vice, to forget and overlook our less fortunate brother, and to scoff at
the providence of God, then we are unworthy and dishonored, though we have been nursed in affluence, or taken our degrees from the lineage of an hundred noble descents; as truly so, in the eye of Heaven,
and of all rightthinking men, as though we lay, victims of beggary and disease, in the hospital, by the hedge, or on the dunghill. The most ordinary human equity looks not at the school, but at the scholar;
and the equity of Heaven will not look beneath that mark.
The poor man also is at school. Let him take care that he learn, rather than complain. Let him hold to his integrity, his candor, and his kindness of heart. Let him beware of envy, and of bondage, and keep
his selfrespect. The body's toil is nothing. Let him beware of the mind's drudgery and degradation. While he betters his condition if he can, let him be more anxious to better his soul. Let him be willing,

while poor, and even if always poor, to learn poverty's great lessons, fortitude, cheerfulness, contentment, and implicit confidence in God's Providence.
With these, and patience, calmness, selfcommand, disinterestedness, and affectionate kindness, the
humble dwelling may be hallowed, and made more dear and noble than the loftiest palace. Let him, above all things, see that he lose not his independence. Let him not cast himself, a creature poorer than
the poor, an indolent, helpless, despised beggar, oft the kindness of others. Every man should choose to have God for his Master, rather than man; and escape not from this school, either by dishonesty or
almstaking, lest he fall into that state, worse than disgrace, where he can have no respect for himself.
The ties of Society teach us to love one another. That is a miserable society, where the absence of affectionate kindness is sought to be supplied by punctilious decorum, graceful urbanity, and polished
insincerity; where ambition, jealousy, and distrust rule, in place of simplicity, confidence, and kindness.
So, too, the social state teaches modesty and gentleness; and from neglect, and notice unworthily bestowed on others, and injustice, and the world's failure to appreciate us, we learn patience and
quietness, to be superior to society's opinion, not cynical and bitter, but gentle, candid, and affectionate still.
Death is the great Teacher, stern, cold, inexorable, irresistible; whom the collected might of the world
cannot stay or ward off. The breath, that parting from the lips of King or beggar, scarcely stirs the hushed air, cannot be bought, or brought back for a moment, with the wealth of Empires. What a lesson
is this, teaching our frailty and feebleness, and an Infinite Power beyond us! It is a fearful lesson, that never becomes familiar. It walks through the earth in dread mystery, and lays it hands upon all. It is a
universal lesson, that is read everywhere and by all men.
Its message comes every year and every day. The past years are crowded with its sad and solemn mementoes; and death's finger traces its handwriting upon the walls of every human habitation.
It teaches us Duty; to act our part well; to fulfill the work assigned us. When one is dying, and after he
is dead, there is but one question: Has he lived well? There is no evil in death but that which life makes. There are hard lessons in the school of God's Providence; and yet the school of life is carefully adjusted,
in all its arrangements and tasks, to man's powers and passions. There is no extravagance in its teachings; nor is anything done for 'the sake of present effect. The whole course of human life is a
conflict with difficulties; and, if rightly conducted, a progress in improvement. It is never too late for man to learn. Not part only, but the whole, of life is a school. There never comes a time, even amidst the
decays of age, when it is fit to lay aside the eagerness of acquisition, or the cheerfulness of endeavor. Man walks, all through the course of life, in patience and strife, and sometimes in darkness; for, from
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



144/641
patience is to come perfection; from strife, triumph is to issue; from the cloud of darkness the lightning is to flash that shall open the way to eternity.
Let the Mason be faithful in the school of life, and to all its lessons! Let him not learn nothing, nor care
not whether he learns or not. Let not the years pass over him, witnesses of only his sloth and indifference; or see him zealous to acquire everything but virtue. Nor let him labor only for himself; nor
forget that the humblest man that lives is his brother, and hath a claim on his sympathies and kind offices; and that beneath the rough garments which labor wears may beat hearts as noble as throb under
the stars of princes.
God, who counts by souls, not stations, Loves and pities you and me; For to Him all vain distinctions Are as pebbles on the sea.
Nor are the other duties inculcated in this Degree of less importance.
Truth, a Mason is early told, is a Divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue; and frankness,
reliability, sincerity, straightforwardness, plaindealing, are but different modes in which Truth develops itself. The dead, the absent, the innocent, and those that trust him, no Mason will deceive willingly. To
all these he owes a nobler justice, in that they are the most certain trials of human Equity. Only the most abandoned of men, said Cicero, will deceive him, who would have remained uninjured if he had not
trusted. All the noble deeds that have beat their marches through succeeding ages have proceeded from men of truth and genuine courage. The man who is always true is both virtuous and wise; and thus
possesses the greatest guards of safety: for the law has not power to strike the virtuous; nor can fortune subvert the wise.
The bases of Masonry being morality and virtue, it is by studying one and practising the other, that the
conduct of a Mason becomes irreproachable.
The good of Humanity being its principal object, disinterestedness is one of the first virtues that it requires of its members; for that is the source of justice and beneficence.
To pity the misfortunes of others; to be humble, but without meanness; to be proud, but without
arrogance; to abjure every sentiment of hatred and revenge; to show himself magnanimous and liberal, without ostentation and without profusion; to be the enemy of vice; to pay homage to wisdom and
virtue; to respect innocence; to be constant and patient in adversity, and modest in prosperity; to avoid every irregularity that stains the soul and distempers the body it is by following these precepts that a

brother; will honor friendship, and fulfill with ardor the duties which virtue and the social relations impose upon him.
It is because Masonry imposes upon us these duties that it is properly and significantly styled work; and
he who imagines that he becomes a Mason by merely taking the first two or three Degrees, and that he may, having leisurely stepped upon that small elevation, thenceforward worthily wear the honors of
Masonry, without labor or exertion, or selfdenial or sacrifice, and that there is nothing to be done in Masonry, is strangely deceived.
Is it true that nothing remains to be done in Masonry?
Does one Brother no longer proceed by law against another Brother of his Lodge, in regard to matters
that could be easily settled within the Masonic family circle?
Has the duel, that hideous heritage of barbarism, interdicted among Brethren by our fundamental laws, and denounced by the municipal code, yet disappeared from the soil we inhabit? Do Masons of high
rank religiously refrain from it; or do they not, bowing to a corrupt public opinion, submit to its arbitrament, despite the scandal which it occasions to the Order, and in violation of the feeble restraint
of their oath?
Do Masons no longer form uncharitable opinions of their Brethren, enter harsh judgments against them, and judge themselves by one rule and their Brethren by another?
Has Masonry any wellregulated system of charity? Has it done that which it should have done for the
cause of education? Where are its schools, its academies, its colleges, its hospitals, and infirmaries?
Are political controversies now conducted with no violence and bitterness?
Do Masons refrain from defaming and denouncing their Brethren who differ with them in religious or political opinions?
What grand social problems or useful projects engage our attention at our communications? Where in
our Lodges are lectures habitually delivered for the real instruction of the Brethren? Do not our sessions pass in the discussion of minor matters of business, the settlement of points of order and questions of
mere administration, and the admission and advancement of Candidates, whom after their admission

146/641
we take no pains to instruct?
In what Lodge are our ceremonies explained and elucidated; corrupted as they are by time, until their true features can scarcely be distinguished; and where are those great primitive truths of revelation
taught, which Masonry has preserved to the world?
We have high dignities and sounding titles. Do their possessors qualify themselves to enlighten the world in respect to the aims and objects of Masonry? Descendants of those Initiates who governed
empires, does your influence enter into practical life and operate efficiently in behalf of wellregulated and constitutional liberty?
Your debates should be but friendly conversations. You need concord, union, and peace. Why then do
you retain among you men who excite rivalries and jealousies; why permit great and violent controversy and ambitious pretensions'? Now do your own words and acts agree? If your Masonry is a
nullity, how can you exercise any influence on others? Continually you praise each other, and utter elaborate and high wrought eulogies upon the Order. Everywhere you assume that you are what you
should be, and nowhere do you look upon yourselves as you are. Is it true that all our actions are so many acts of homage to virtue? Explore the recesses of your hearts; let us examine ourselves with an
impartial eye, and make answer to our own questioning! Can we bear to ourselves the consoling testimony that we always rigidly perform our duties; that we even half perform them?
Let us away with this odious selfflattery! Let us be men, if we cannot be sages! The laws of Masonry,
above others excellent, cannot wholly change men's natures. They enlighten them, they point out the true way; but they can lead them in it, only by repressing the fire of their passions, and subjugating their
selfishness. Alas, these conquer, and Masonry is forgotten!
After praising each other all our lives, there are always excellent Brethren, who, over our coffins, shower unlimited eulogies. Every one of us who dies, however useless his life, has been a model of all
the virtues, a very child of the celestial light. In Egypt, among our old Masters, where Masonry was more cultivated than vanity, no one could gain admittance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had
passed under the most solemn judgment. A grave tribunal sat in judgment upon all, even the kings. They said to the dead, "Whoever thou art, give account to thy country of thy actions! What hast thou
done with thy time and life? The law interrogates thee, thy country hears thee, Truth sits in judgment on thee!" Princes came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser
recounted the history of the dead man's life, and threw the blaze of the torch of truth on all his actions. If it were adjudged that he had led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of the
nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. What a lesson the old Masonry taught to the sons of the people!

Is it true that Masonry is effete; that the acacia, withered, affords no shade; that Masonry no longer
marches in the advanceguard of Truth? No.
Is freedom yet universal? Have ignorance and prejudice disappeared from the earth? Are there no longer enmities among men? Do cupidity and falsehood no longer exist? Do toleration and harmony
prevail among religious and political sects? There are works yet left for Masonry to accomplish, greater than the twelve labors of Hercules: to advance ever resolutely and steadily; to enlighten the minds of the
people, to reconstruct society, to reform the laws, and to improve the public morals.
The eternity in front of it is as infinite as the one behind. And Masonry cannot cease to labor in the cause of social progress, without ceasing to be true to itself, Masonry.
XII. GRAND MASTER ARCHITECT
[Master Architect]
The great duties that are inculcated by the lessons taught by the working instruments of a Grand Master Architect, demanding so much of us, and taking for granted the capacity to perform them faithfully and
fully, bring us at once to reflect upon the dignity of human nature, and the vast powers and capacities of the human soul; and to that theme we invite your attention in this Degree. Let us begin to rise from
earth toward the Stars.
Evermore the human soul struggles toward the light, toward God, and the Infinite. It is especially so in its afflictions. Words go but a little way into the depths of sorrow. The thoughts that writhe there in
silence, that go into the stillness of Infinitude and Eternity, have no emblems. Thoughts enough come there, such as no tongue ever uttered. They do not so much want human sympathy, as higher help.
There is a loneliness in deep sorrow which the Deity alone can relieve. Alone, the mind wrestles with the great problem of calamity, and seeks the solution from the Infinite Providence of Heaven, and thus
is led directly to God.
There are many things in us of which we are not distinctly conscious. To waken that slumbering consciousness into life, and so to lead the soul up to the Light, is one office of every great ministration
to human nature, whether its vehicle be the pen, the pencil, or the tongue. We are unconscious of the intensity and awfulness of the life within us. Health and sickness, joy and sorrow, success and
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



148/641
disappointment, life and death, love and loss, are familiar words upon our lips; and we do not know to what depths they point within us.
We seem never to know what any thing means or is worth until we have lost it. Many an organ, nerve,
and fibre in our bodily frame performs its silent part for years, and we are quite unconscious of its value. It is not until it is injured that we discover that value, and find how essential it was to our
happiness and comfort. We never know the full significance of the words �property," "ease," and
"health;" the wealth of meaning in the fond epithets, "parent,� �child," "beloved," and "friend," until
the thing or the person is taken away; until, in place of the bright, visible being, comes the awful and desolate shadow, where nothing is: where we stretch out our hands in vain, and strain our eyes upon
dark and dismal vacuity. Yet, in that vacuity, we do not lose the object that we loved. It becomes only the more real to us. Our blessings not only brighten when they depart, but are fixed in enduring reality;
and love and friendship receive their everlasting seal under the cold impress of death.
A dim consciousness of infinite mystery and grandeur lies beneath all the commonplace of life. There is an awfulness and a majesty around us, in all our little worldliness. The rude peasant from the
Apennines, asleep at the foot of a pillar in a majestic Roman church, seems not to hear or see, but to, dream only of the herd he feeds or the ground he tills in the mountains. But the choral symphonies fall
softly upon his ear, and the gilded arches are dimly seen through his halfslumbering eyelids.
So the soul, however given up to the occupations of daily life, cannot quite lose the sense of where it is, and of what is above it and around it. The scene of its actual engagements may be small; the path of its
steps, beaten and familiar; the objects it handles, easily spanned, and quite worn out with daily uses. So it may be, and amidst such things that we all live.
So we live our little life; but Heaven is above us and all around and close to us; and Eternity is before us
and behind us; and suns and stars are silent witnesses and watchers over us. We are enfolded by Infinity. Infinite Powers and Infinite spaces lie all around us. The dread arch of Mystery spreads over us, and no
voice ever pierced it. Eternity is enthroned amid Heaven's myriad starry heights; and no utterance or word ever came from those faroff and silent spaces. Above, is that awful majesty; around us,
everywhere, it stretches off into infinity; and beneath it is this little struggle of life, this poor day's conflict, this busy anthill of Time.
But from that anthill, not only the talk of the streets, the sounds of music and revelling, the stir and
tread of a multitude, the shout of joy and the shriek of agony go up into the silent and allsurrounding Infinitude; but also, amidst the stir and noise of visible life, from the inmost bosom of the visible man,
there goes up an imploring call, a beseeching cry, an asking, unuttered, and unutterable, for revelation, wailingly and in almost speechless agony praying the dread arch of mystery to break, and the stars that

roll above the waves of mortal trouble, to speak; the enthroned majesty of those awful heights to find a voice; the mysterious and reserved heavens to come near; and all to tell us what they alone know; to
give us information of the loved and lost; to make known to us what we are, and whither we are going.
Man is encompassed with a dome of incomprehensible wonders. In him and about him is that which should fill his life with majesty and sacredness. Something of sublimity and sanctity has thus flashed
down from heaven into the heart of every one that lives. There is no being so
base and abandoned but hath some traits of that sacredness left upon him; something, so much perhaps
in discordance with his general repute, that he hides it from all around him; some sanctuary in his soul, where no one may enter; some sacred inclosure, where the memory of a child is, or the image of a
venerated parent, or the remembrance of a pure love, or the echo of some word of kindness once spoken to him; an echo that will never die away.
Life is no negative, or superficial or worldly existence. Our steps are evermore haunted with thoughts,
far beyond their own range, which some have regarded as the reminiscences of a preexistent state. So it is with us all, in the beaten and worn track of this worldly pilgrimage. There is more here, than the
world we live in. It is not all of life to live. An unseen and infinite presence is here; a sense of something greater than we possess; a seeking, through all the void wastes of life, for a good beyond it; a
crying out of the heart for interpretation; a memory of the dead, touching continually some vibrating thread in this great tissue of mystery.
We all not only have better intimations, but are capable of better things than we know. The pressure of
some great emergency would develop in us powers, beyond the worldly bias of our spirits; and Heaven so deals with us, from time to time, as to call forth those better things. There is hardly a family in the
world go selfish, but that, if one in it were doomed to die one, to be selected by the others, it would be utterly impossible for its members, parents and children, to choose out that victim; but that each would
say, "I will die; but I cannot choose." And in how many, if that dire extremity had come, would not one and another step forth, freed from the vile meshes of ordinary selfishness, and say, like the Roman
father and son, "Let the blow fall on me!" There are greater and better things in us all, than the world takes account of, or than we take note of; if we would but find them out. And it is one part of our
Masonic culture to find these traits of power and sublime devotion, to revive these faded impressions of generosity and selfsacrifice, the almost squandered bequests of God's love and kindness to our souls;
and to induce us to yield ourselves to their guidance and control.
Upon all conditions of men presses down one impartial law. To all situations, to all fortunes, high or low, the mind gives their character. They are, in effect, not what they are in themselves, but what they
are to the feeling of their possessors. The King may be mean, degraded, miserable; the slave of ambition, fear, voluptuousness, and every low passion. The Peasant may be the real Monarch, the moral
master of his fate, a free and lofty being, more than a Prince in happiness, more than a King in honor.

Man is no bubble upon the sea of his fortunes, helpless and irresponsible upon the tide of events. Out of
the same circumstances, different men bring totally different results. The same difficulty, distress, poverty, or misfortune, that breaks down one man, builds up another and makes him strong. It is the
very attribute and glory of a man, that he can bend the circumstances of his condition to the intellectual and moral purposes of his nature, and it is the power and mastery of his will that chiefly distinguish
him from the brute.
The faculty of moral will, developed in the child, is a new element of his nature. It is a new power brought upon the scene, and a ruling power, delegated from Heaven. Never was a human being sunk so
low that he had not, by God's gift, the power to rise, Because God commands him to rise, it is certain that he can rise.
Every man has the power, and should use it, to make all situations, trials, and temptations instruments
to promote his virtue and happiness; and is so far from being the creature of circumstances, that he creates and controls them, making them to be all that they are, of evil or of good, to him as a moral
being.
Life is what we make it, and the world is what we make it. The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation; but very different are the aspects which it bears to
them. To the one, it is all beauty and gladness; the waves of ocean roll in light, and the mountains are covered with day. Life, to him, flashes, rejoicing, upon every flower and every tree that trembles in the
breeze. There is more to him, everywhere, than the eye sees; a presence of profound joy on hill and valley, and bright, dancing water. The other idly or mournfully gazes at the same scene, and everything
wears a dull, dim, and sickly aspect. The murmuring of the brooks is a discord to him, the great roar of the sea has an angry and threatening emphasis, the solemn music of the pines sings the requiem of his
departed happiness; the cheerful light shines garishly upon his eyes and offends him. The great train of the seasons passes before him like a funeral procession; and he sighs, and turns impatiently away. The
eye makes that which it looks upon; the ear makes its own melodies and discords; the world without reflects the world within.
Let the Mason never forget that life and the world are what we make them by our social character; by
our adaptation, or want of adaptation to the social conditions, relationships, and pursuits of the world. To the selfish, the cold, and the insensible, to the haughty and presuming, to the proud, who demand
more than they are likely to receive, to the jealous, ever afraid they shall not receive enough, to those who are unreasonably sensitive about the good or ill opinions of others, to all violators of the social
laws, the rude, the violent, the dishonest, and the sensual, to all these, the social condition, from its very nature, will present annoyances, disappointments, and pains, appropriate to their several characters.
The benevolent affections will not revolve around selfishness; the coldhearted must expect to meet

coldness; the proud, haughtiness; the passionate, anger; and the violent, rudeness. Those who forget the rights of others, must not be surprised if their own are forgotten; and those who stoop to the lowest
embraces of sense must not wonder, if others are not concerned to find their prostrate honor, and lift it up to the remembrance and respect of the world.
To the gentle, many will be gentle; to the kind, many will be kind. A good man will find that there is
goodness in the world; an honest man will find that there is honesty in the world; and a man of principle will find principle and integrity in the minds of others.
There are no blessings which the mind may not convert into the bitterest of evils; and no trials which it
may not transform into the noblest and divinest blessings. There are no temptations from which assailed virtue may not gain strength, instead of falling before them, vanquished and subdued. It is true that
temptations have a great power, and virtue often falls; but the might of these temptations lies not in themselves, but in the feebleness of our own virtue, and the weakness of our own hearts. We rely too
much on the strength of our ramparts and bastions, and allow the enemy to make his approaches, by trench and parallel, at his leisure. The offer of dishonest gain and guilty pleasure makes the honest man
more honest, and the pure man more pure. They raise his virtue to the height of towering indignation. The fair occasion, the safe opportunity, the tempting chance become the defeat and disgrace of the
tempter. The honest and upright man does not wait until temptation has made its approaches and mounted its batteries on the last parallel.
But to the impure, the dishonest, the falsehearted, the corrupt, and the sensual, occasions come every
day, and in every scene, and through every avenue of thought and imagination. He is prepared to capitulate before the first approach is commenced; and sends out the white flag when the enemy's
advance comes in sight of his walls. He makes occasions; or, if opportunities come not, evil thoughts come, and he throws wide open the gates of his heart and welcomes those bad visitors, and entertains
them with a lavish hospitality.
The business of the world absorbs, corrupts, and degrades one mind, while in another it feeds and nurses the noblest independence, integrity, and generosity. Pleasure is a poison to some, and a healthful
refreshment to others. To one, the world is a great harmony, like a noble strain of music with infinite modulations; to another, it is a huge factory, the clash and clang of whose machinery jars upon his ears
and frets him to madness. Life is substantially the same thing to all who partake of its lot. Yet some rise to virtue and glory; while others, undergoing the same discipline, and enjoying the same privileges,
sink to shame and perdition.
Thorough, faithful, and honest endeavor to improve, is always successful, and the highest happiness. To sigh sentimentally over human misfortune, is fit only for the mind's childhood; and the mind's misery is

chiefly its own fault; appointed, under the good Providence of God, as the punisher and corrector of its fault. In the long run, the mind will be happy, just in proportion to its fidelity and wisdom. When it is
miserable, it has planted the thorns in its own path; it grasps them, and cries out in loud complaint; and that complaint is but the louder confession that the thorns which grew there, it planted.
A certain kind and degree of spirituality enter into the largest part of even the most ordinary life. You
can carry on no business, without some faith in man. You cannot even dig in the ground, without a reliance on the unseen result. You cannot think or reason or even step, without confiding in the inward,
spiritual principles of your nature. All the affections and bonds, and hopes and interests of life centre in the spiritual; and you know that if that central bond were broken, the world would rush to chaos.
Believe that there is a God; that He is our father; that He has a paternal interest in our welfare and
improvement; that He has given us powers, by means of which we may escape from sin and ruin; that He has destined us to a future life of endless progress toward perfection and a knowledge of Himself
believe this, as every Mason should, and you can live calmly, endure patiently, labor resolutely, deny yourselves cheerfully, hope steadfastly, and be conquerors in the great struggle of life. Take away any
one of these principles, and what remains for us? Say that there is no God; or no way opened for hope and reformation and triumph, no heaven to come, no rest for the weary, no home in the bosom of God
for the afflicted and disconsolate soul; or that God is but an ugly blind Chance that stabs in the dark; or a somewhat that is, when attempted to be defined, a nowhat, emotionless, passionless, the Supreme
Apathy to which all things, good and evil, are alike indifferent; or a jealous God who revengefully visits the sins of the fathers on the children, and when the fathers have eaten sour grapes, sets the children's
teeth on edge; an arbitrary supreme Will, that has made it right to be virtuous, and wrong to lie and steal, because IT pleased to make it so rather than otherwise, retaining the power to
reverse the law; or a fickle, vacillating, inconstant Deity, or a cruel, bloodthirsty, savage Hebrew or Puritanic one; and we are but the sport of chance and the victims of despair; hapless wanderers upon
the face of a desolate, forsaken, or accursed and hated earth; surrounded by darkness, struggling with obstacles, toiling for barren results and empty purposes, distracted with doubts, and misled by false
gleams of light; wanderers with no way, no prospect, no home; doomed and deserted mariners on a dark and stormy sea, without compass or course, to whom no stars appear; tossing helmless upon the
weltering, angry waves, with no blessed haven in the distance whose guidingstar invites us to its welcome rest.
The religious faith thus taught by Masonry is indispensable to the attainment of the great ends of life;
and must therefore have been designed to be a part of it. We are made for this faith; and there must be something, somewhere, for us to believe in. We cannot grow healthfully, nor live happily, without it. It
is therefore true. If we could cut off from any soul all the principles taught by Masonry, the faith in a God, in immortality, in virtue, in essential rectitude, that soul would sink into sin, misery, darkness, and
ruin. If we could cut off all sense of these truths, the man would sink at once to the grade of the animal.

No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, otherwise than
as the swine are, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must, of necessity, embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live
happily. "I put my trust in God," is the protest of Masonry against the belief in a cruel, angry, and revengeful God, to be feared and not reverenced by His creatures.
Society, in its great relations, is as much the creation of Heaven as is the system of the Universe. If that
bond of gravitation that holds all worlds and systems together, were suddenly severed, the universe would fly into wild and boundless chaos. And if we were to sever all the moral bonds that hold society
together; if we could cut off from it every conviction of Truth and Integrity, of an authority above it, and of a conscience within it, it would immediately rush to disorder and frightful anarchy and ruin.
The religion we teach is therefore as really a principle of things, and as certain and true, as gravitation.
Faith in moral principles, in virtue, and in God, is as necessary for the guidance of a man, as instinct is
for the guidance of an animal. And therefore this faith, as a principle of man's nature, has a mission as truly authentic in God's Providence, as the principle of instinct. The pleasures of the soul, too, must
depend on certain principles. They must recognize a soul, its properties and responsibilities, a conscience, and the sense of an authority above us; and these are the principles of faith. No man can
suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must of necessity embrace the great
truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. Everything in the universe has fixed and certain laws and principles for its action; the star in its orbit, the animal in its activity, the physical man
in his functions. And he has likewise fixed and certain laws and principles as a spiritual being. His soul does not die for want of aliment or guidance. For the rational soul there is ample provision. From the
lofty pine, rocked in the darkening tempest, the cry of the young raven is heard; and it would be most strange if there were no answer for the cry and call of the soul, tortured by want and sorrow and agony.
The total rejection of all moral and religious belief would strike out a principle from human nature, as essential to it as gravitation to the stars, instinct to animal life, the circulation of the blood to the human
body.
God has ordained that life shall be a social state. We are members of a civil community. The life of that community depends upon its moral condition. Public spirit, intelligence, uprightness, temperance,
kindness, domestic purity, will make it a happy community, and give it prosperity and continuance. Widespread selfishness, dishonesty, intemperance, libertinism, corruption, and crime, will make it
miserable, and bring about dissolution and speedy ruin. A whole people lives one life; one mighty heart heaves in its bosom; it is one great pulse of existence that throbs there. One stream of life flows there,
with ten thousand intermingled branches and channels, through all the homes of human love. One

sound as of many waters, a rapturous jubilee or a mournful sighing, comes up from the congregated dwellings of a whole nation.
The Public is no vague abstraction; nor should that which is done against that Public, against public
interest, law, or virtue, press but lightly on the conscience. It is but a vast expansion of individual life; an ocean of tears, an atmosphere of sighs, or a great whole of joy and gladness. It suffers with the
suffering of millions; it rejoices with the joy of millions. What a vast crime does he commit, private man or public man, agent or contractor, legislator or magistrate, secretary or president,who dares, with
indignity and wrong, to strike the bosom of the Public Welfare, to encourage venality and corruption, and shameful sale of the elective franchise, or of office; to sow dissension, and to weaken the bonds of
amity that bind a Nation together! What a huge iniquity, he who, with vices like the daggers of a parricide, dares to pierce that mighty heart, in which the ocean of existence is flowing!
What an unequalled interest lies in the virtue of every one whom we love! In his virtue, nowhere but in
his virtue, is garnered up the incomparable treasure. What care we for brother or friend, compared with what we care for his honor, his fidelity, his reputation, his kindness? How venerable is the rectitude of a
parent! How sacred his reputation! No blight that can fall upon a child, is like a parent's dishonor. Heathen or Christian, every parent would have his child do well; and pours out upon him all the fullness
of parental love, in the one desire that he may do well; that he may be worthy of his cares, and his freely bestowed pains; that he may walk in the way of honor and happiness. In that way he cannot walk one
step without virtue. Such is life, in its relationships. A thousand ties embrace it, like the fine nerves of a delicate organization; like the strings of an instrument capable of sweet melodies, but easily put out of
tune or broken, by rudeness, anger, and selfish indulgence.
If life could, by any process, be made insensible to pain and pleasure; if the human heart were hard as adamant, then avarice, ambition, and sensuality might channel out their paths in it, and make it their
beaten way; and none would wonder or protest. If we could be patient under the load of a mere worldly life; if we could bear that burden as the beasts bear it; then, like beasts, we might bend all our thoughts
to the earth; and no call from the great Heavens above us would startle us from our plodding and earthly course.
But we art not insensible brutes, who can refuse the call of reason and conscience. The soul is capable
of remorse. When the great dispensations of life press down upon us, we weep, and suffer and sorrow. And sorrow and agony desire other companionships than worldliness and irreligion. We are not willing
to bear those burdens of the heart, fear, anxiety, disappointment, and trouble, without any object or use. We are not willing to suffer, to be sick and afflicted, to have our days and months lost to comfort and
joy, and overshadowed with calamity and grief, without advantage or compensation; to barter away the dearest treasures, the very sufferings, of the heart; to sell the lifeblood from failing frame and fading
cheek, our tears of bitterness and groans of anguish, for nothing. Human nature, frail, feeling, sensitive,

and sorrowing, cannot bear to suffer for nought.
Everywhere, human life is a great and solemn dispensation. Man, suffering, enjoying, loving, hating, hoping, and fearing, chained to the earth and yet exploring the far recesses of the universe, has the
power to commune with God and His angels. Around this great action of existence the curtains of Time are drawn; but there are openings through them which give us glimpses of eternity. God looks down
upon this scene of human probation. The wise and the good in all ages have interposed for it with their teachings and their blood. Everything that exists around us, every movement in nature every counsel of
Providence, every interposition of God, centres upon one point, the fidelity of man. And even if the ghosts of the departed and remembered could come at midnight through the barred doors of our
dwellings, and the shrouded dead should glide through the aisles of our churches and sit in our Masonic Temples, their teachings would be no more eloquent and impressive than the Great realities of life; than
those memories of misspent years, those ghosts of departed opportunities, that, pointing to our conscience and eternity cry continually in our ears, "Work while the day lasts! for the night of death
cometh, in which no man can work.�
There are no tokens of public mourning for the calamity of the soul. Men weep when the body dies; and when it is borne to its last rest, they follow it with sad and mournful procession. But for the dying soul
there is no open lamentation; for the lost soul there are no obsequies.
And yet the mind and soul of man have a value which nothing else has. They are worth a care which nothing else is worth; and to the single, solitary individual, they ought to possess an interest which
nothing else possesses. The stored treasures of the heart, the unfathomable mines that are in the soul to be wrought, the broad and boundless realms of
Thought, the freighted argosy of man's hopes and best affections, are brighter than gold and dearer than
treasure.
And yet the mind is in reality little known or considered. It is all which man permanently is, his inward being, his divine energy, his immortal thought, his boundless capacity, his infinite aspiration; and
nevertheless, few value it for what it is worth. Few see a brothermind in others, through the rags with which poverty has clothed it, beneath the crushing burdens of life, amidst the close pressure of worldly
troubles, wants and sorrows. Few acknowledge and cheer it in that humble blot, and feel that the nobility of earth, and the commencing glory of Heaven are there.
Men do not feel the worth of their own souls. They are proud of their mental powers; but the intrinsic,
inner, infinite worth of their own minds they do not perceive. The poor man, admitted to a palace, feels, lofty and immortal being as he is, like a mere ordinary thing amid the splendors that surround him. He

sees the carriage of wealth roll by him, and forgets the intrinsic and eternal dignity of his own mind in a poor and degrading envy, and feels as an humbler creature, because others are above him, not in mind,
but in mensuration. Men respect themselves, according as they are more wealthy, higher in rank or office, loftier in the world's opinion, able to command more votes, more the favorites of the people or
of Power.
The difference among men is not so much in their nature and intrinsic power, as in the faculty of communication. Some have the capacity of uttering and embodying in words their thoughts. All men,
more or less, feel those thoughts. The glory of genius and the rapture of virtue, when rightly revealed, are diffused and shared among unnumbered minds. When eloquence and poetry speak; when those
glorious arts, statuary, painting, and music, take audible or visible shape; when patriotism, charity, and virtue speak with a thrilling potency, the hearts of thousands glow with a kindred joy and ecstasy. If it
were not so, there would be no eloquence; for eloquence is that to which other hearts respond; it is the faculty and power of making other hearts respond. No one is so low or degraded, as not sometimes to
be touched with the beauty of goodness. No heart is made of materials so common, or even base, as not sometimes to respond, through every chord of it, to the call of honor, patriotism, generosity, and virtue.
The poor African Slave will die for the master. or mistress, or in defence of the children, whom he loves. The poor, lost, scorned, abandoned, outcast woman will, without expectation of reward nurse
those who are dying on every hand, utter strangers to her, with a contagious and horrid pestilence. The pickpocket will scale burning walls to rescue child or woman, unknown to him, from the ravenous
flames.
Most glorious is this capacity! A power to commune with God and His Angels; a reflection of the Uncreated Light; a mirror that can collect and concentrate upon itself all the moral splendors of the
Universe. It is the soul alone that gives any value to the things of this world. and it is only by raising the soul to its just elevation above all other things, that we can look rightly upon the purposes of this
earth. No sceptre nor throne, nor structure of ages, nor broad empire, can compare with the wonders and grandeurs of a single thought. That alone, of all things that have been made, comprehends the
Maker of all. That alone is the key which unlocks all the treasures of the Universe; the power that reigns over Space, Time, and Eternity. That, under God, is the Sovereign Dispenser to man of all the blessings
and glories that lie within the compass of possession, or the range of possibility. Virtue, Heaven, and Immortality exist not, nor ever will exist for us except as they exist and will exist, in the perception,
feeling, and thought of the glorious mind.
My Brother, in the hope that you have listened to and understood the Instruction and Lecture of this Degree, and that you feel the dignity of your own nature and the vast capacities of your own soul for
good or evil, I proceed briefly to communicate to you the remaining instruction of this Degree.
The Hebrew word, in the old Hebrew and Samaritan character, suspended in the East, over the five

157/641
columns, is ADONA�, one of the names of God, usually translated Lord; and which the Hebrews, in reading, always substitute for the True Name, which is for them ineffable.
The five columns, in the five different orders of architecture, are emblematical to us of the five
principal divisions of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite:
1. The Tuscan, of the three blue Degrees, or the primitive Masonry.
2. The Doric, of the ineffable Degrees, from the, fourth to the fourteenth, inclusive.
3. The Ionic, of the fifteenth and sixteenth, or second temple Degrees.
4. The Corinthian, of the seventeenth and eighteenth Degrees, or those of the new law.
5. The Composite, of the philosophical and chivalric Degrees intermingled, from the nineteenth to the thirtysecond, inclusive.
The North Star, always fixed and immutable for us, represents the point in the centre of the circle, or
the Deity in the centre of the Universe. It is the especial symbol of duty and of faith. To it, and the seven that continually revolve around it, mystical meanings are attached, which you will learn hereafter,
if you should be permitted to advance, when you are made acquainted with the philosophical doctrines of the Hebrews.
The Morning Star, rising in the East, Jupiter, called by the Hebrews Tsad�c or Tsydyk, Just, is an
emblem to us of the ever approaching dawn of perfection and Masonic light.
The three great lights of the Lodge are symbols to us of the Power, Wisdom, and Beneficence of the Deity. They are also symbols of the first three Sephiroth, or Emanations of the Deity, according to the
Kabalah, Kether, the omnipotent divine will; Chochmah, the divine intellectual power to generate thought, and Binah, the divine intellectual capacity to produce it the two latter, usually translated
Wisdom and Understanding, being the active and the passive, the positive and the negative, which we do not yet endeavor to explain to you. They are the
columns Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the entrance to the Masonic Temple.
In another aspect of this Degree, the Chief of the Architects [Rab Banaim], symbolizes the constitutional executive head and chief of a free government; and the Degree teaches us that no free
government can long endure, when the people cease to select for their magistrates the best and the wisest of their statesmen; when, passing these by, they permit factions or sordid interests to select for
them the small, the low, the ignoble, and the obscure, and into such hands commit the country's

destinies. There is, after all, a "divine right" to govern; and it is vested in the ablest, wisest, best, of every nation.
"Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding: I am power: by me kings do reign, and
princes decree justice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the magistrates of the earth."
For the present, my Brother, let this suffice. We welcome you among us, to this peaceful retreat of virtue, to a participation in our privileges, to a share in our joys and our sorrows.
XIII. ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON.
WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historically true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendary myth,
you must find out for yourself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even
among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a hundred times in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets.
We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that
wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adona� instead; and that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to the
latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an
amulet, a protection against personal danger, sickness,
and evil spirits. We know that all this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people, necessarily
disappearing as the intellect of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason.
It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctity of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by the ancient Persians (who were among
the earliest emigrants from Northern India) to be pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or
OM, the Sacred Name of the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva.
These superstitious notions in regard to the efficacy of the Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could, being errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or of the esoteric

159/641
doctrine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of which was confined to the Initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of some other Name or truth, the
interpretation and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the
ancient nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has always been that allegories, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understood by the sages, have become or bred errors,
by being literally accepted.
It is true, that before the masoretic points were invented (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in
which it was written. It was, therefore, possible for that of the name of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and
therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the Ineffable Word.
The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the
pronunciation of the word was a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is
one interpretation true, but not the inner and profoundest one.
Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through
the fire to Moloch.
Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the Initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory, in which are represented the
general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and the low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand
Architect of the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars
and sacrificed to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidumm, and Malc�m, the Aam�nite god, and built
high places for Kam�s, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the BeniAam �n. The true nature of God was unknown to them, like His name; and they worshipped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the desert
they did that made for them by Aar�n.
The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one only God until a late period in their history. Their early and popular ideas of the Deity were singularly low and unworthy. Even while Moses
was receiving the law upon Mount Sinai, they forced Aar�n to make them an image of the Egyptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the worship of the gods of the

Mitzraim; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout worshippers of the false gods of all the surrounding nations. "Ye have borne," Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty
years' journeying in the desert, under Moses, "the tabernacle of your Malec and Kai�n your idols, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves." Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions
of God formed by individuals varied according to their intellectual and spiritual capacities; poor and imperfect, and investing God with the commonest and coarest attributes of humanity, among the
ignorant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richly gifted. These conceptions gradually improved and became purified and ennobled, as the nation advanced in civilization being lowest in the
historical books, amended in the prophetic writings, and reaching their highest elevation among the poets.
Among all the ancient nations there was one faith and one idea of Deity for the enlightened, intelligent,
and educated, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews were no exception. Yehovah, to the mass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around them, except that he was the
peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac, and of that of Jacob, and afterward the National God; and, as they believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshipped
by their neighbors "Who among the Baalim is like unto thee, O Yehovah?" expressed their whole creed.
The Deity of the early Hebrews talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in
the cool of the day; he conversed with Kayin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his tent; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise; he permitted Abraham to
expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determination in regard to Sodom; he wrestled with Jacob; he showed Moses his person, though not his face; he dictated the minutest police
regulations and the dimensions of the tabernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burntofferings; he was angry, jealous, and revengeful, as well as wavering
and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performance of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarity. He
hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah.
Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble
to correct these notions; or the popular intellect was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almighty.
But such were not the ideas of the intellectual and enlightened few among the Hebrews. It is certain that
they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations Zoroaster, Menu, Confucius, Socrates, and Plato. But their doctrines on this
subject were esoteric; they did not communicate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few;

and as they were communicated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Phoenicia, in Greece and Samothrace, in the greater mysteries, to the Initiates.
The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted,
under other names, what we now call Masonry, or Free or FrankMasonry. That knowledge was, in one sense, the Lost Word, which was made known to the Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Masons. It
would be folly to pretend that the forms of Masonry were the same in those ages as they are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the Degrees now in use, were not then
known.
Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history, with its present Degrees, further than the year 1700, if so far. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country, Masonry existed
as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon builded the temple, but centuries before before even the first colonies emigrated into Southern India, Persia, and Egypt, from
the cradle of the human race.
The Supreme, Selfexistent, Eternal, Allwise, Allpowerful, Infinitely Good, Pitying, Beneficent, and Merciful Creator and Preserver of the Universe was the same, by whatever name he was called, to the
intellectual and enlightened men of all nations. The name was nothing, if not a symbol and representative hieroglyph of his nature and attributes. The name AL represented his remoteness above
men, his inaccessibility; BAL and BALA, his might; ALOHIM, his various potencies; IHUH, existence and the generation of things. None of his names, among the Orientals, were the symbols of a divinely
infinite love and tenderness, and allembracing mercy. As MOLOCH or MALEK he was but an
omnipotent monarch, a tremendous and irresponsible Will; as ADONA�, only an arbitrary LORD and
Master; as AL Shada�, potent and a DESTROYER.
To communicate true and correct ideas in respect of the Deity was one chief object of the mysteries. In
them, Kh�r�m the King, and Kh�r�m the Master, obtained their knowledge of him and his
attributes; and in them that knowledge was taught to Moses and Pythagoras.
Wherefore nothing forbids you to consider the whole legend of this Degree, like that of the Master's, an allegory, representing the perpetuation of the knowledge of the True God in the sanctuaries of
initiation. By the subterranean vaults you may understand the places of initiation, which in the ancient ceremonies were generally under ground.
The Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of the Universe; and resembled, in its
arrangements and furniture, all the temples of the ancient nations that practised the mysteries. The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has come down to us

in Masonry; though the esoteric meaning with which the numbers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majority of those who use them. Those numbers were especially employed that had a
reference to the Deity, represented his attributes, or figured in the framework of the world, in time and space, and formed more or less the bases of that framework. These were universally regarded as
sacred, being the expression of order and intelligence, the utterances of Divinity Himself.
The Holy of Holies of the Temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the number four, by which the ancients
presented Nature, it being the number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the elements, the cardinal points and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the
Supreme Being.
Hence the name of the Deity, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of His nature and His
attributes is written by Him upon the leaves of the great Book of Universal Nature, and may be read there by all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellect and intelligence. This knowledge of
God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason's Word.
Within the Temple, all the arrangements were mystically and symbolically connected with the same
system. The vault or ceiling, starred like the firmament, was supported by twelve columns, representing the twelve months of the year. The border that ran around the columns represented the zodiac, and one
of the twelve celestial signs was appropriated to each column. The brazen sea was supported by twelve oxen, three looking to each cardinal point of the compass.
And so in our day every Masonic Lodge represents the Universe. Each extends, we are told, from the
rising to the setting sun, from the South to the North, from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens, and from the same to the centre of the globe. In it are represented the sun, moon, and stars; three great
torches in the East, West, and South, forming a triangle, give it light: and, like the Delta or Triangle suspended in the East, and inclosing the Ineffable Name, indicate, by the mathematical equality of the
angles and sides, the beautiful and harmonious proportions which govern in the aggregate and details of the Universe; while those sides and angles represent, by their number, three, the Trinity of Power,
Wisdom, and Harmony, which presided at the building of this marvellous work These three great lights also represent the great mystery of the three principles, of creation, dissolution or destruction, and
reproduction or regeneration, consecrated by all creeds in their numerous Trinities.
The luminous pedestal, lighted by the perpetual flame within, is a symbol of that light of Reason, given by God to man, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thought, the

revelation of the attributes of the Deity.
The three Masters, Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin, are types of the True Mason, who seeks for knowledge from pure motives, and that he may be the better enabled to serve and benefit his fellow
men; while the discontented and presumptuous Masters who were buried in the ruins of the arches represent those who strive to acquire it for unholy purposes, to gain power over their fellows, to gratify
their pride, their vanity, or their ambition.
The Lion that guarded the Ark and held in his mouth the key wherewith to open it, figuratively represents Solomon, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who preserved and communicated the key to the
true knowledge of God, of His laws, and of the profound mysteries of the moral and physical Universe.
ENOCH [ Khan�c], we are told, walked with God three hundred years, after reaching the age of sixty five "walked with God, and he was no more, for God had taken him." His name signified in the
Hebrew, INITIATE or INITIATOR. The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the
mysteries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed
down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories.
The legend of this Degree is thus, partially, interpreted. It is of little importance whether it is in anywise
historical. For its value consists in the lessons which it inculcates, and the duties which it prescribes to those who receive it. The parables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valuable than history.
Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths are concealed in and symbolized by the legend and the myth.
There are profounder meanings concealed in the symbols of this Degree, connected with the
philosophical system of the Hebrew Kabalists, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be so fortunate as to advance. They are unfolded in the higher Degrees. The lion [Arai, Araiah, which also
means the altar] still holds in his mouth the key of the enigma of the sphynx.
But there is one application of this Degree, that you are now entitled to know; and which, remembering
that Kh�r�m, the Master, is the symbol of human freedom, you would probably discover for yourself.
It is not enough for a people to gain its liberty. It must secure it. It must not intrust it to the keeping, or
hold it at the pleasure, of any one man. The keystone of the Royal Arch of the great Temple of Liberty

is a fundamental law, charter, or constitution; the expression of the fixed habits of thought of the people, embodied in a written instrument, or the result of the slow accretions and the consolidation of
centuries; the same in war as in peace; that cannot be hastily changed, nor be violated with impunity, but is sacred, like the Ark of the Covenant of God, which none could touch and live.
A permanent constitution, rooted in the affections, expressing the will and judgment, and built upon the
instincts and settled habits of thought of the people, with an independent judiciary, an elective legislature of two branches, an executive responsible to the people, and the right of trial by jury, will
guarantee the liberties of a people, if it be virtuous and temperate, without luxury, and without the lust of conquest and dominion, and the follies of visionary theories of impossible perfection.
Masonry teaches its Initiates that the pursuits and occupations of this life, its activity, care, and
ingenuity, the predestined developments of the nature given us by God, tend to promote His great design, in making the world; and are not at war with the great purpose of life. It teaches that everything
is beautiful in its time, in its place, in its appointed office; that everything which man is put to do, if rightly and faithfully done, naturally helps to work out his salvation; that if he obeys the genuine
principles of his calling, he will be a good man and that it is only by neglect and nonperformance of the task set for him by Heaven, by wandering into idle dissipation, or by violating their beneficent and lofty
spirit, that he becomes a bad man. The appointed action of life is the great training of Providence; and if man yields himself to it, he will need neither churches nor ordinances, except for the expression of his
religious homage and gratitude.
For there is a religion of toil. It is not all drudgery, a mere stretching of the limbs and straining of the sinews to tasks. It has a meaning and an intent.
A living heart pours lifeblood into the toiling arm; and warm affections inspire and mingle with man's
labors. They are the home affections. Labor toils afield, or plies its task in cities, or urges the keels of commerce over wide oceans; but home is its centre; and thither it ever goes with its earnings, with the
means of support and comfort for others; offerings sacred to the thought of every true man, as a sacrifice at a golden shrine.
Many faults there are amidst the toils of life; many harsh and hasty words are uttered; but still the toils
go on, weary and hard and exasperating as they often are. For in that home is age or sickness, or helpless infancy, or gentle childhood, or feeble woman, that must not want. If man had no other than
mere selfish impulses, the scene of labor which we behold around us would not exist.
The advocate who fairly and honestly presents his case, with feeling of true selfrespect, honor, and conscience, to help the tribunal on towards the right conclusion, with a conviction that God's justice

reigns there, is acting a religious part, leading that day religious life; or else right and justice are no part of religion Whether, during all that day, he has once appealed, in form or in terms, to his
conscience, or not; whether he has once spoken of religion and God, or not; if there has been the inward purpose, the conscious intent and desire, that sacred justice should triumph, he has that day led a good
and religious life, and made most a essential contribution to that religion of life and of society, the cause of equity between man and man, and of truth and right action in the world.
Books, to be of religious tendency in the Masonic sense, need not be books of sermons, of pious
exercises, or of prayers. Whatever inculcates pure, noble, and patriotic sentiments, or touches the heart with the beauty of virtue, and the excellence of an upright life, accords with the religion of Masonry,
and is the Gospel of literature and art. That Gospel is preached from many a book and painting, from many a poem and fiction, and review and newspaper; and it is a painful error and miserable narrowness,
not to recognize these widespread agencies of Heaven's providing; not to see and welcome these many handed coadjutors, to the great and good cause. The oracles of God do not speak from the pulpit alone.
There is also a religion of society. In business, there is much more than sale, exchange, price, payment;
for there is the sacred faith of man in man. When we repose perfect confidence in the integrity of another; when we feel that he will not swerve from the right, frank, straightforward, conscientious
course, for any temptation; his integrity and conscientiousness are the image of God to us; and when we believe in it, it is as great and generous an act, as when we believe in the rectitude of the Deity.
In gay assemblies for amusement, the good affections of life gush and mingle. If they did not, these
gatheringplaces would be as dreary and repulsive as the caves and dens of outlaws and robbers. When friends meet, and hands are warmly pressed, and the eye kindles and the countenance is suffused with
gladness, there is a religion between their hearts; and each loves and worships the True and Good that is in the other. It is not policy, or selfinterest, or selfishness that spreads such a charm around that
meeting, but the halo of bright and beautiful affection.
The same splendor of kindly liking, and affectionate regard, shines like the soft overarching sky, over all the world; over all places where men meet, and walk or toil together; not over lovers' bowers and
marriagealtars alone, not over the homes of purity and tenderness alone; but over all tilled fields, and busy workshops, and dusty highways, and paved streets.
There is not a worn stone upon the sidewalks, but has been the altar of such offerings of mutual
kindness; nor a wooden pillar or iron railing against which hearts beating with affection have not leaned. How many soever other elements there are in the stream of life flowing through these channels,
that is surely here and everywhere; honest, heartfelt, disinterested, inexpressible affection.

Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instruction in religion. For here are inculcated disinterestedness, affection, toleration, devotedness, patriotism, truth, a generous sympathy
with those who suffer and mourn, pity for the fallen, mercy for the erring, relief for those in want, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Here we meet as brethren, to learn to know and love each other. Here we greet each
other gladly, are lenient to each other's faults, regardful of each other's feelings, ready to relieve each other's wants. This is the true religion revealed to the ancient patriarchs; which Masonry has taught for
many centuries, and which it will continue to teach as long as time endures. If unworthy passions, or selfish, bitter, or revengeful feelings, contempt, dislike, hatred, enter here, they are intruders and n t
welcome, strangers uninvited, and not guests.
Certainly there are many evils and bad passions and much hate and contempt and unkindness everywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil that is in life. But all is not evil. We still see
God in the world.
There is good amidst the evil. The hand of mercy leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and sorrow. Truth and simplicity live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hearts underneath gay robes,
and under tattered garments also.
Love clasps the hand of love, amid all the envyings and distractions of showy competition; fidelity, pity, and sympathy hold the long nightwatch by the bedside of the suffering neighbor, amidst the
surrounding poverty and squalid misery. Devoted men go from city to city to nurse those smitten down by the terrible pestilence that renews at intervals its mysterious marches. Women wellborn and
delicately nurtured nursed the wounded soldiers in hospitals, before it became fashionable to do so; and even poor lost women, whom God alone loves and pities, tend the plaguestricken with a patient and
generous heroism. Masonry and its kindred Orders teach men to love each other, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the sick, and bury the friendless dead. Everywhere God finds and blesses the kindly
office, the pitying thought, and the loving heart.
There is an element of good in all men's lawful pursuits and a divine spirit breathing in all their lawful affections. The ground on which they tread is holy ground. There is a natural religion of life, answering,
with however many a broken tone, to the religion of nature. There is a beauty and glory in Humanity., in man, answering, with however many a mingling shade, to the loveliness of soft landscapes and swelling
hills, and the wondrous Men may be virtuous, selfimproving, and religious in their employments.
Precisely for that, those employments were made. All their social relations, friendship, love , the ties of family, were made to be holy. They may be religious, not by a kind of protest and resistance against
their several vocations; but by conformity to their true spirit. Those vocations do not exclude religion; but demand it, for their own perfection. They may be religious laborers, whether in field or factory;

religious physicians, lawyers, sculptors, poets, painters, and musicians.
They may be religious in all the toils and in all the amusements of life. Their life may be a religion; the broad earth its altar; its incense the very breath of life; its fires ever kindled by the brightness of
Heaven.
Bound up with our poor, frail life, is the mighty thought that spurns the narrow span of all visible existence. Ever the soul reaches outward, and asks for freedom. It looks forth from the narrow and
grated windows of sense, upon the wide immeasurable creation; it knows that around it and beyond it lie outstretched the infinite and everlasting paths.
Everything within us and without us ought to stir our minds to admiration and wonder. We are a
mystery encompassed with mysteries. The connection of mind with matter is a mystery; the wonderful telegraphic communication between the brain and every part of the body, the power
and action of the will. Every familiar step is more than a story in a land of enchantment. The power of movement is as mysterious as the power of thought. Memory, and dreams that are the indistinct echoes
of dead memories are alike inexplicable. Universal harmony springs from infinite complication. The momentum of every step we take in our dwelling contributes in part to the order of the Universe. We
are connected by ties of thought, and even of matter and its forces, with the whole boundless Universe and all the past and coming generations of men.
The humblest object beneath our eye as completely defies our scrutiny as the economy of the most
distant star. Every leaf and every blade of grass holds within itself secrets which no human penetration will ever fathom. No man can tell what is its principle of life. No man can know what his power of
secretion is. Both are inscrutable mysteries. Wherever we place our hand we lay it upon the locked bosom of mystery. Step where we will, we tread upon wonders. The seasands, the clods of the field,
the waterworn pebbles on the hills, the rude masses of rock, are traced over and over, in every direction, with a handwriting older and more significant and sublime than all the ancient ruins, and all
the overthrown and buried cities that past generations have left upon the earth; for it is the handwriting of the Almighty.
A Mason's great business with life is to read the book of its teaching; to find that life is not the doing of
drudgeries, but the hearing of oracles. The old mythology is but a leaf in that book; for it peopled the world with spiritual natures; and science, manyleaved, still spreads before us the same tale of wonder.
We shall be just as happy hereafter, as we are pure and upright, and no more, just as happy as our
character prepares us to be, and no more. Our moral, like our mental character, is nut formed in a

moment; it is the habit of our minds; the result of many thoughts and feelings and efforts, bound together by many natural and strong ties. The great law of Retribution is, that all coming experience is
to be affected by every present feeling; every future moment of being must answer for every present moment; one moment, sacrificed to vice, or lost to improvement, is forever sacrificed and lost; an hour's
delay to enter the right path, is to put us back so far, in the everlasting pursuit of happiness; and every sin, even of the best men, is to be thus answered for, if not according to the full measure of its illdesert,
yet according to a rule of unbending rectitude and impartiality.
The law of retribution presses upon every m an, whether he thinks of it or not. It pursues him through all the courses of life, with a step that never falters nor tires, and with an eye that never sleeps. If it were
not so, God's government would not be impartial; 'there would be no discrimination; no moral dominion; no light shed upon the mysteries of Providence.
Whatsoever a man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. That which we are doing, good
or evil, grave or gay, that which we do today and shall do tomorrow; each thought, each feeling, each action, each event; every passing hour, every breathing moment; all are contributing to form the
character according to which we are to be judged. Every particle of influence that goes to form that aggregate, our character, will, in that future scrutiny, be sifted out from the mass; and, particle by
particle, with ages perhaps intervening, fall a distinct contribution to the sum of our joys or woes. Thus every idle word and idle hour will give answer in the judgment.
Let us take care, therefore, what we sow. An evil temptation comes upon us; the opportunity of
unrighteous gain, or of unhallowed indulgence, either in the sphere of business or pleasure, of society or solitude. We yield; and plant a seed of bitterness and sorrow. Tomorrow it will threaten discovery.
Agitated and alarmed, we cover the sin, and bury it deep in falsehood and hypocrisy. In the bosom where it lies concealed, in the fertile soil of kindred vices, that sin dies not, but thrives and grows; and
other and still other germs of evil gather around the accursed root; until from that single seed of corruption, there springs up in the soul all that is horrible in habitual lying, knavery, or vice.
Loathingly, often, we take each downward step; but a frightful power urges us onward; and the hell of debt, disease, ignominy, or remorse gathers its shadows around Our steps even on earth; and are yet but
the beginnings of sorrows. The evil deed may be done in a single moment; but conscience never dies, memory never sleeps; guilt never can become innocence; and remorse can never whisper peace.
Beware, thou who art tempted to evil! Beware what thou layest up for the future! Beware what thou
layest up in the archives of eternity! Wrong not thy neighbor! lest the thought of him thou injurest, and who suffers by thy act, be to thee a pang which years will not deprive of its bitterness! Break not into
the house of innocence, to rifle it of its treasure; lest when many years have passed over thee, the moan of its distress may not have died away from thine ear! Build not the desolate throne of ambition in thy
heart; nor be busy with devices, and circumventings, and selfish schemings; lest desolation and

loneliness be on thy path, as it stretches into the long futurity! Live not a useless, an impious, or an injurious life! for bound up with that life is the immutable principle of an endless retribution, and
elements of God's creating, which will never spend their force, but continue ever to unfold with the ages of eternity. Be not deceived! God has formed thy nature, thus to answer to the future. His law can never
be abrogated, nor His justice eluded; and forever and ever it will be true, that "Whatsoever a man
soweth, that also he shall reap.�
XIV GRAND ELECT, PERFECT, AND SUBLIME MASON
[Perfect Elu]
It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Masonry, by reflection upon its symbols and a
wise consideration and analysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does not inculcate her truths.
She states them, once and briefly or hints them, perhaps, darkly or interposes a cloud between them and
eyes that would be dazzled by them.
"Seek, and ye shall find," knowledge and the truth. The practical object of Masonry is the physical and moral amelioration and the intellectual and spiritual improvement of individuals and society. Neither
can be effected, except by the dissemination of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallacy in principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the mis fortunes of nations are owing. Public
opinion is rarely right on any point; and there are and always will be important truths to be substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors and absurd and injurious prejudices.
There are few truths that public opinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies; and few
errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radi ant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral mala dies, also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires not only boldness,
but also, and more, prudence and discretion; since they are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral, political, and religious, than of vicious inclinations.
Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speech revealing it to him who even partially
comprehends all the Degrees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to those who advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil,
even in the Degree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is a worship.

Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlightening men's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, in spiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, and requiring of its
disciples that their language and actions shall conform to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, control their passions, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as one afflicted with a deplorable
malady.
It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as God planted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has ever been longlived that was not built on this foundation. It is the base, and
they are the superstructure. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." "Is not this the
fast that I have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?" The ministers of this religion are all Masons who
comprehend it and are devoted to it; its sacrifices to God are good works, the sacrifices of the base and disorderly passions, the offering up of selfinterest on the altar of humanity, and perpetual efforts to
attain to all the moral perfection of which man is capable.
To make honor and duty the steady beacon lights that shall guide your lifevessel over the stormy seas of time; to do that which it is right to do, not because it will insure you success, or bring with it a
reward, or gain the applause of men, or be "the best policy," more prudent or more advisable; but because it is right, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantly against error, intolerance,
ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those who err, to be tolerant even of intolerance, to teach the ignorant, and to labor to reclaim the vicious, are some of the duties of a Mason. A good Mason is one
that can look upon death, and see its face with the same countenance with which he hears its story; that can endure all the labors of his life with his soul supporting his body, that can equally despise riches
when he hath them and when he hath them not; that is, not sadder if they are in his neighbor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about his own walls; one that is not moved with good
fortune coming to him, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's lands with equanimity and pleasure, as if they were his own; and yet look upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were
another man's; that neither spends his goods prodigally and foolishly, nor yet keeps them avariciously and like a miser; that weighs not benefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circumstances of
him who confers them; that never thinks his charity expensive, if a worthy person be the receiver; that does nothing for opinion's sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful of his thoughts as of his
acting in markets and theatres, and in as much awe of himself as of a whole assembly; that is, bountiful and cheerful to his friends, and charitable and apt to forgive his enemies; that loves his country,
consults its honor, and obeys its laws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he may do his duty and honor God. And such a Mason may reckon his life to be the life of a man, and compute his
months, not by the course of the sun, but by the zodiac and circle of his virtues.
The whole world is but one republic, of which each nation is a family, and every individual a child. Masonry, not in anywise derogating from the differing duties which the diversity of states requires,

tends to create a new people, which, composed of men of many nations and tongues, shall all be bound together by the bonds of science, morality, and virtue.
Essentially philanthropic, philosophical, and progressive, it has for the basis of its dogma a firm belief
in the existence of God and his providence, and of the immortality of the soul; for its object, the dissemination of moral, political, philosophical, and religious truth, and the practice of all the virtues.
In every age, its device has been, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," with constitutional government, law, order, discipline, and subordination to legitimate authority government and not anarchy.
But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. It braces all parties and all sects, to form from
among them all a vast fraternal association. It recognizes the dignity of human nature, and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and it knows nothing that should place one man below another,
except ignorance, debasement, and crime, and the necessity of subordina tion to lawful will and authority.
It is philanthropic; for it recognizes the great truth that all men are of the same origin, have common
interests, and should cooperate together to the same end.
Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give to each other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstances of life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as their joys and
pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions, and be perfectly tolerant of the errors, of each other, in matters of faith and beliefs.
It is philisophical because it teaches the great Truths concerning the nature and existence of one
Supreme Deity, and the existence and immortality of the soul. It revives the Academy of Plato and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reiterates the maxims of Pythagoras, Confucius, and Zoroaster, and
reverentially enforces the sublime lessons of Him who died upon the Cross.
The ancients thought that universal humanity acted under the influence of two opposing Principles, the Good and the Evil: of which the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and De votedness and
the Evil toward Falsehood, Servility, and Selfishness. Masonry represents the Good Principle and constantly wars against the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, the Mithras, and the
Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadly feud with the demons of ignorance, brutality, baseness, falsehood, slavishness of soul, intolerance, superstition, tyranny, meanness, the insolence of wealth, and bigotry.
When despotism and superstition, twinpowers of evil and darkness, reigned everywhere and seemed
invincible and immortal, it invented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, the allegory, the

symbol, and the emblem, and transmitted its doctrines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancient symbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displays in every civilized country its banner,
on which in letters of living light its great principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts of kings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and interdiction.
Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much positive truth as the human mind is capable of
receiving; whether that truth is attained by the exercise of reason, or communicated by revelation. It must necessarily be both limited and alloyed, to bring it within the competence of finite human
intelligence. Being finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite; being material, we can form no clear conception of the Spiritual. We do believe in and know the infinity of Space and
Time, and the spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity and spirituality eludes us. Even Omnipotence cannot infuse infinite conceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirely
changing the conditions of our being, pour a complete and full knowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrow capacity of a human soul. Human intelligence could not grasp it, nor human
language express it. The visible is, necessarily, the measure of the invisible.
The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. His knowledge cannot pass beyond the limits of his own being. His conceptions of other things and other beings are only his conceptions. They are
not those things or beings themselves. The living principle of a living Universe must be INFINITE; while all our ideas and conceptions are finite, and applicable only to finite beings.
The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge, but of faith; not to be approached by the understanding,
but by the moral sense; not to be conceived, but to be felt. All attempts to embrace the Infinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only accommodations to the frailty of man. Shrouded from
human comprehension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination is awed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weakness, the Divine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to
dogmatize. Here the philosophic Intellect becomes most painfully aware of its own insufficiency.
And yet it is here that man most dogmatizes, classifies and describes God's attributes, makes out his map of God's nature, and his inventory of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions; and then
hangs and burns his brother, who, as dogmatically as he, makes out a different map and inventory. The common understanding has no humility. Its God is an incarnate Divinity. Imperfection imposes its own
limitations on the Illimitable, and clothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms that come within the grasp of the senses and the intellect, and are derived from that infinite and imperfect nature
which is but God's creation.
We are all of us, though not all equally, mistaken. The cherished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the pure truth of God; but simply our own special form of error, our guesses at truth,

173/641
the refracted and fragmentary rays of light that have fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have their day, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and He is more than they. Perfect
truth is not attainable anywhere. We style this Degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches is imperfect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuit of truth, nor contentedly acquiesce in
error. It is our duty always to press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unattainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capable of progressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry
is a continual struggle toward the light.
All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most injurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature and attributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by ignorance of the True
Word. The true word of a Mason is, not the entire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highest and noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable of forming; and this word is
Ineffable, because one man cannot communicate to another his own conception of Deity; since every man's conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cultivation and intellectual powers, and
moral excellence. God is, as man conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself.
For every man's conception of God must vary with his mental cultivation and mental powers. If any one contents himself with any lower image than his intellect is capable of grasping, then he contents
himself with that which is false to him, as well as false in fact. If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false. And if we, of the nineteenth century after Christ, adopt the con ceptions of the
nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptions of God are those of the ignorant, narrowminded, and vindictive Israelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, meaner, and more limited view
of His nature, than the faculties which He has bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we can form is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one, we acquiesce in an untruth. We feel
that it is an affront and an indignity to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, shortsighted, capricious, and unjust; as a jealous, an angry, a vindictive Being. When we examine our conceptions of His character, if
we can conceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, and magnificent character, then this latter is to us the true conception of Deity; for nothing can be imagined more excellent than He.
Religion, to obtain currency and influence with the great mass of mankind, must needs be alloyed with
such an amount of error as to place it far below the standard attainable by the higher human capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cultivated human reason could discern, would not be
comprehended by, or effective over, the less educated portion of mankind. What is Truth to the philosopher, would not be Truth, nor have the effect of Truth, to the peasant. The religion of the many
must necessarily be more incorrect than that of the refined and reflective few, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in the spiritual idea which lies latent at the bottom of it, as in the
symbols and dogmas in which that idea is embodied. The truest religion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the igno rant, nor consolatory to them, nor guiding and supporting for them. The
doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in the language of strict truth, but in that which was fittest to convey to a rude and ignorant people the practical essentials of the doctrine. A perfectly pure faith,

free from all extraneous admixtures, a system of noble theism and lofty morality, would find too little preparation for it in the common mind and heart, to admit of prompt reception by the masses of
mankind; and Truth might not have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error.
The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as an Original Creator; as a God at hand, and not merely one afar off in the distance of infinite space, and in the remoteness of Past or Future Eternity.
He conceives of Him as taking a watchful and presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influencing the hearts and actions of men.
To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Matter; and man, with his wonderful
corporeal and mental frame, His direct work. He believes that God has made men with different intellectual capacities, and enabled some, by superior intellectual power, to see and originate truths
which are hidden from the mass of men. He believes that when it is His will that mankind should make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnant discovery, He calls into being some intellect of more
than ordi nary magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, and grander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humanity.
We hold that God has so ordered matters in this beautiful and harmonious, but mysteriously governed
Universe, that one great mind after another will arise, from time to time, as such are needed, to reveal to men the truths that are wanted, and the amount of truth than can be borne. He so arranges, that nature
and the course of events shall send men into the world, endowed with that higher mental and moral organization, in which grand truths, and sublime gleams of spiritual light will spontaneously and
inevitably arise. These speak to men by inspiration.
Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imaginary type, to us, of humanity in its highest phase; an exemplar of what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in his progress toward
the realization of his destiny; an individual gifted with a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization, and a perfectly balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanity may be, and what we
believe it will hereafter be in God's good time; the possibility of the race made real. The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but perplexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He
holds that every man sent upon this earth, and especially every man of superior capacity, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism to be baptized with; that every great and good man possesses
some portion of God's truth, which he must proclaim to the world, and which must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simple sense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intellectual to be inspired, and to
be so for the instruction, advancement, and elevation of mankind. That kind of inspiration, like God's omnipresence, is not limited to the few writers claimed by Jews, Christians, or Moslems, but is co
extensive with the race. It is the consequence of a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God is its source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as the intellectual endowments, the moral
wealth of the soul, and the degree of cultivation of those endowments and faculties differ. It is limited

to no sect, age, or nation. It is wide as the world and common as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancy of mankind, to monopolize inspiration, and bar God out of the soul. We are not born in
the dotage and decay of the world. The stars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavens are fresh and strong. God is still everywhere in nature. Wherever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith
and Reason utter their oracles, there is God, as formerly in the hearts of seers and prophets. No soil on earth is so holy as the good man's heart; nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to the
learned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithful child of God. Certain as the open eye drinks in the light, do the pure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a presence
within the soul. The conscience is the very voice of Deity.
Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, the Moslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster, can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God who is above all
the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its Initiates to look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the written scriptures of his own religion. For itself it finds those truths definite enough, which are
written by the finger of God upon the heart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views of religion and duty, wrought out by the meditations of the studious, confirmed by the allegiance of the
good and wise, stamped as sterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind, commend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be accepted by all.
The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainly imagine such certainty attainable. He
considers that if there were no written revelation, he could safely rest the hopes that animate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions of reason and the convictions of instinct and
consciousness. He can find a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductions of the intellect and convictions of the heart. For reason proves to him the existence and attributes of God; and those
spiritual instincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuse into his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of the beneficence of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future ex
istence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringly point to virtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose of man's life.
He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the framework and revolutions of the Earth, the mysterious
beauties and adaptations of animal existence, the moral and material constitution of the human creature, so fearfully and wonderfully made; and is satisfied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the
author of the starry Heavens above him, and of the moral world within him; and his mind finds an adequate foundation for its hopes, its worship, its principles of action, in the farstretching Universe, in
the glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with unutterable thoughts.
These are truths which every reflecting mind will unhesitatingly receive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improvement; and fitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only a little
lower than the angels. The worthlessness of ceremonial observances, and the necessity of active virtue;

176/641
the enforcement of purity of heart as the security for purity of life, and of the government of the thoughts, as the originators and forerunners of action; universal philanthropy, requiring us to love all
men, and to do unto others that and that only which we should think it right, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness of injuries; the necessity of selfsacrifice in the discharge of duty; humility;
genuine sincerity, and being that which we seem to be; all these sublime precepts need no miracle, no voice from the clouds, to recommend them to our allegiance, or to assure us of their divine origin. They
command obedience by virtue of their inherent rectitude and beauty; and have been, and are, and will be the law in every age and every country of the world. God revealed them to man in the beginning.
To the Mason, God is our Father in Heaven, to be Whose special children is the sufficient reward of the
peacemakers, to see whose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; who is ever at hand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fervent love is due, our most humble and patient submission;
Whose most acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a benefi cent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whose merciful disposal we are resigned by that death which, we hope and
believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and whose wise decrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolent content.
As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man, Masonry teaches little about which men
can differ, and little from which they can dissent. He is our Father; and we are all brethren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fully as to those who have most leisure and are most learned.
This needs no Priest to teach it, and no authority to indorse it; and if every man did that only which is consistent with it, it would exile barbarity, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treachery,
revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad passions beyond the confines of the world.
The true Mason, sincerely holding that a Supreme God created and governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws, which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwavering,
inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrows are ordained for his chastening, his strengthening, his elaboration and development; because they are the necessary results of the operation of laws, the
best that could be devised for the happiness and purification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunity for the practice of all the virtues, from the homeliest and most common, to the noblest and
most sublime; or perhaps not even that, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious, eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believes that the ordained operations of nature,
which have brought misery to him, have, from the very unswerving tranquility of their career, showered blessings and sunshine upon many another path; that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has
crushed or maimed him in its allotted course, is pressing onward to the accomplishment of those serene and mighty purposes, to have contributed to which, even as a victim, is an honor and a recompense. He
takes this view of Time and Nature and God, and yet bears his lot with out murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, the best possible, because ordained by God. He does not believe that God
loses sight of him, while superintending the march of the great harmonies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen, when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long succession of its
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



177/641
operations preordained, that in the great march of those events, he would suffer pain and undergo calamity. He believes that his individual good entered into God's consideration, as well as the great
cardinal results to which the course of all things is tending.
Thus believing, he has attained an eminence in virtue, the highest, amid passive excellence, which humanity can reach. He finds his reward and his support in the reflection that he is an unreluctant and
selfsacrificing cooperator with the Creator of the Universe; and in the noble consciousness of being worthy and capable of so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then truly entitled to be
called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason. He is content to fall early in the battle, if his body may but form a steppingstone for the future conquests of humanity.
It cannot be that God, Who, we are certain, is perfectly good, can choose us to suffer pain, unless either
we are ourselves to receive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else as such pain is a necessary part in the scheme of the Universe, which as a whole is good.
In either case, the Mason receives it with submission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so.
What ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares for His creatures, he cannot doubt that; nor that it would not have been so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or for some other
persons, or for some things. To complain and lament is to murmur against God's will, and worse than unbelief.
The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mould than those of the ignorant and unreflecting, and is
instinct with a diviner life, who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven rather than the peace of Eden, to whom a loftier being brings severer cares, who knows that man does not live by
pleasure or content alone, but by the presence of the power of God, must cast behind him the hope of any other repose or tranquillity, than that which is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must
relinquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble is the avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim his lamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligently done. If he
does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tradition, he must build his own house, his own system of faith and thought, for himself.
The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be our stimulating and sustaining power. Our
object, and not ourselves, should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when tem porary, and for time. Spun out to eternity, it does not become celestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for
Heaven or Bliss, but for Duty.
In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts to those of thousands of others, to contribute to the carrying forward of a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for a very

distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future advent of some great amendment; the amount which each one contrib utes to the achievement of ultimate success, the portion of the price which justice
should assign to each as his especial production, can never be accurately ascertained.
Perhaps few of those who have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, to bring about some political or social change, which they felt convinced would ultimately prove of vast service to humanity,
lived to see the change effected, or the anticipated good flow from it.
Fewer still of them were able to pronounce what appreciable weight their several efforts contributed to the achievement of the change desired. Many will doubt, whether in truth, these exertions have any
influence whatever; and discouraged, cease all active effort.
Not to be thus discouraged, the Mason must labor to elevate and purify his motives, as well as sedulously cherish the conviction, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thing as effort
thrown away; that in all labor there is profit; that all sincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarily followed, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, by an appropriate and proportionate
success; that no bread cast upon the waters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground can fail to quicken in due time and measure; and that, however we may, in moments of despondency, be apt
to doubt, not only whether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we shall have contributed to its triumph, there is One, Who has not only seen every exertion we have made, but Who can assign the
exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain the great victory over social evil. No good work is done wholly in vain.
The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason will in nowise deserve that honorable title, if he has not
that strength, that will, that selfsustaining energy; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthly hope, nor ever thinks of victory, but, content in its own consummation, combats, because it ought to combat, rejoicing
fights, and still rejoicing falls.
The Augean Stables of the World, the accumulated uncleanness and misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse them thoroughly away; every drop we contribute aids to swell that river and
augment its force, in a degree appreciable by God, though not by man; and he whose zeal is deep and earnest, will not be overanxious that his individual drops should be distinguishable amid the mighty
mass of cleansing and fertilizing waters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow in ineffective singleness away.
The true Mason will not be careful that his name should be inscribed upon the mite which he casts into
the treasury of God. It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of purpose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success; that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



179/641
infinitely small concern; and still more, that the consciousness of having so contributed, however obscurely and unnoticed, is his sufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect, Perfect,
and Sublime Mason cherish this faith. It is a duty. It is the brilliant and neverdying light that shines within and through the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes the perfect cube of agate,
symbol of duty, inscribed with the divine name of God. He who industriously sows and reaps is a good laborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that which shall be reaped by others, by those who
will know not of and care not for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, worthy of a more excellent reward.
The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluing of this life, as an insignificant and
unworthy portion of existence; for that demands feelings which are unnatural, and which, there fore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insincere; and teaches us to look rather to a future
life for the compensation of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and so does injury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress. Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be
performed. It is the beginning of our immortality. Those only who feel a deep interest and affection for this world will work resolutely for its amelioration; those whose affections are transferred to Heaven,
easily acquiesce in the miseries of earth, deeming them hopeless, befitting, and ordained; and console themselves with the idea of the ammends which are one day to be theirs.
It is a sad truth, that those most decidedly given to spiritual contemplation, and to making religion rule
in their hearts, are often most apathetic to ward all improvement of this world's systems, and in many cases virtual conservatives of evil and hostile to political and social reform, as diverting men's energies
from eternity.
The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macerate the body into weakness and disorder, and disparage what he sees to be beautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakably dear and
fascinating.
He does not put aside the nature which God has given him, to struggle after one which He has not bestowed. He knows that man is sent into the world, not a spiritual, but a composite being, made up of
body and mind, the body having, as is fit and needful in a material world, its full, rightful, and allotted share. His life is guided by a full recognition of this fact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admit
it in weaknesses and inevitable failings. He believes that his spirituality will come in the next stage of his being, when he puts on the spiritual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, until
then, God meant it to be commanded and controlled, but not neglected, despised, or ignored by the soul, under pain of heavy consequences.
Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, after its present life, as to its continued and

180/641
eternal being, and the character of the scenes in which that being will be fully developed. These are to him topics of the proroundest interest, and the most ennobling and refining contemplation. They
occupy much of his leisure and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and calamities of this life, as his hopes are disappointed and his visions of happiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in its
race of hours; when he is harassed and toilworn, and the burden of his years weighs heavy on him, the balance of attraction gradually inclines in favor of another life; and he clings to his lofty speculations
with a tenacity of interest which needs no injunction, and will listen to no prohibition. They are the consoling privilege of the aspiring, the wayworn, the weary, and the bereaved.
To him the contemplation of the Future lets in light upon the Present, and develops the higher portions
of his nature. He endeavors rightly to adjust the respective claims of Heaven and earth upon his time and thought, so as to give the proper proportions thereof to performing the duties and entering into the
interests of this world, and to preparation for a better; to the cultivation and purification of his own character, and to the public service of his fellowmen.
The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and uttering his own convictions, he leaves every one
else free to do the same; and only hopes that the time will come, even if after the lapse of ages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, and one law alone, the law of love, shall govern God's
whole Universe.
Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to you without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, but hath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as we wear, with
humility, and conscious of your demerits and shortcomings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason.
It is not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the number of the Apostles of Christ, and seventy
two that of his Disciples that John addressed his rebukes and menaces to the Seven churches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. At Babylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a pyramid
of Seven stories, and at Ecbatana Seven concentric inclosures, each of a different color. Thebes also had Seven gates, and the same num ber is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. The
Sephiroth, or Emanations, ten in number, three in one class, and seven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras. Seven Amschaspands or planetary spirits were invoked with Ormuzd; Seven
inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with the head of their family in an ark and Seven ancient personages alone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale of the grievous waters. There
were Seven Heliadae, whose father Helias, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; Seven Titans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; Seven Corybantes; and Seven Cabiri, sons of
Sydyk; Seven primeval Celestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karlesters who escaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a new race, on the summit of Mount Albordi. Seven Cyclopes,
also, built the walls of Tiryus. Celus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians represented by

symbols the two fold motion of the stars, fixed and planetary, and the passage of the Soul through their successive spheres. They erected in their holy caves, in which the mystic rites of the Mithriac Initiations
were practised, what he denominates a high ladder, on the Seven steps of which were Seven gates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principal heavenly bodies. Through these the aspirants
passed, until they reached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled a transmigration through the spheres.
Jacob saw in his dream a ladder planted or set on the earth, and its top reaching to Heaven, and the
Malaki Alohim ascending and descending on it, and above it stood IHUH, declaring Himself to be BhuhAlhi Abraham. The word translated ladder, is Salam, from Salal, raised, elevated, reared up,
exalted, piled up into a heap, Aggeravit. Salalah, means a heap, rampart, or other accumulation of earth or stone, artificially made; and Salaa or Salo, is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name of the city of
Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew word to designate a pyramid.
The symbolic mountain Meru was ascended by Seven steps or stages and all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocks thrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous and mystic mountain,
for purposes of worship. These were the "High Places" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on which the idolaters sacrificed to foreign gods.
The pyramids were sometimes square, and sometimes round. The sacred Babylonian tower [Magdol],
dedicated to the great Father Bal, was an artificial hill, of pyramidal shape, and Seven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color, representing the Seven planetary spheres by the appropriate
color of each planet. Meru itself was said to be a single mountain, terminating in three peaks, and thus a symbol of the Trimurti. The great Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a temple as the
seventh, and on this three spires or towers.
An ancient pagoda at Deogur was surmounted by a tower, sustaining the mystic egg and a trident.
Herodotus tells us that the Temple of Bal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting on an eighth that served as basis, and successively diminishing in size from the bottom to the top; and
Strabo tells us it was a pyramid.
Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was really a pyramid with Seven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture, through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach the summit, and
then descended through similar doors on the opposite side of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul being thus represented.
Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples were tended to symbolize the Universe, which
itself was habitually called the Temple and habitation of Deity. Every temple was the world in miniature; and so the whole world was one grand temple. The most ancient temples were roofless; and

therefore the Persians, Celts, and Scythians strongly disliked artificial cov ered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian tem ples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnifi
cent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobius says that the entire Universe was judiciously deemed by many the Temple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deity to be
the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, varie gated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuine Temple of the Divinity.
How completely the Temple of Solomon was symbolic, is manifest, not only from the continual
reproduction in it of the sacred numbers and of astrological symbols in the historical descriptions of it; but also, and yet more, from the details of the imaginary reconstructed edifice, seen by Ezekiel in his
vision. The Apocalypse completes the demonstration, and shows the kabalistic meanings of the whole. The Symbola Architectonica are found on the most ancient edifices and these mathematical figures and
instruments, adopted by the Templars, and identical with those on the gnostic seals and abraxae, connect their dogma with the Chaldaic, Syriac, and Egyptian Oriental philosophy. The secret
Pythagorean doc trines of numbers were preserved by the monks of Thibet, by the Hierophants of Egypt and Eleusis, at Jerusalem, and in the circular Chapters of the Druids; and they are especially
consecrated in that mysterious book, the Apocalypse of Saint John.
All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the number of the constellations, the signs of the zodiac, or the cycles of the planets and each one was a microcosm or symbol of the Universe, having
for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven.
All temples were originally open at the top, having for roof the sky. Twelve pillars described the belt of the zodiac. Whatever the number of the pillars, they were mystical everywhere. At Abury, the Druidic
temple reproduced all the cycles by its columns. Around the temples of Chilminar in Persia, of Baalbec, and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartary, on the frontier of China, stood forty pillars. On each side of the
temple at Paestum were fourteen, recording the Egyptian cycle of the dark and light sides of the moon, as described by Plutarch; the whole thirtyeight that surrounded them recording the two meteoric cycles
so often found in the Druidic temples.
The theatre built by Scaurus, in Greece, was surrounded by 360 columns; the Temple at Mecca, and that at Iona in Scotland, by 360 stones.

This Degree, like all others in Masonry, is symbolical. Based upon historical truth and authentic tradition, it is still an allegory. The leading lesson of this Degree is Fidelity to obligation, and
Constancy and Perseverance under difficulties and discouragement.
Masonry is engaged in her crusade, against ignorance, intolerance, fanaticism, superstition, uncharitableness, and error. She does not sail with the tradewinds, upon a smooth sea, with a steady
free breeze, fair for a welcoming harbor; but meets and must overcome many opposing currents, baffling winds, and dead calms.
The chief obstacles to her success are the apathy and faithlessness of her own selfish children, and the
supine indifference of the world. In the roar and crush and hurry of life and business, and the tumult and uproar of politics, the quiet voice of Masonry is unheard and unheeded. The first lesson which one
learns, who engages in any great work of reform or beneficence, is, that men are essentially careless, lukewarm, and indifferent as to everything that does not concern their own personal and immediate
welfare. It is to single men, and not to the united efforts of many, that all the great works of man, struggling toward perfection, are owing. The enthusiast, who imagines that he can inspire with his own
enthusiasm the multitude that eddies around him, or even the few who have associated themselves with him as coworkers, is grievously mistaken; and most often the conviction of his own mistake is followed
by discouragement and disgust. To do all, to pay all, and to suffer all, and then, when despite all obstacles and hindrances, success is accomplished, and a great work done, to see those who opposed or
looked coldly on it, claim and reap all the praise and reward, is the common and almost universal lot of the benefactor of his kind.
He who endeavors to serve, to benefit, and improve the world, is like a swimmer, who struggles against
a rapid current, in a river lashed into angry waves by the winds. Often they roar over his head, often they beat him back and baffle him. Most men yield to the stress of the current, and float with it to the
shore, or are swept over the rapids; and only here and there the stout, strong heart and vigorous arms struggle on toward ultimate success.
It is the motionless and stationary that most frets and impedes the current of progress; the solid rock or
stupid dead tree, rested firmly on the bottom, and around which the river whirls and eddies: the Masons that doubt and hesitate and are discouraged; that disbelieve in the capability of man to improve; that are
not disposed to toil and labor for the interest and wellbeing of gen eral humanity; that expect others to do all, even of that which they do not oppose or ridicule; while they sit, applauding and doing nothing,
or perhaps prognosticating failure.
There were many such at the rebuilding of the Temple. There were prophets of evil and misfortune the lukewarm and the indifferent and the apathetic; those who stood by and sneered and those who thought

they did God service enough if they now and then faintly applauded. There were ravens croaking ill omen, and murmurers who preached the folly and futility of the attempt. The world is made up of such
and they were as abundant then as they are now.
But gloomy and discouraging as was the prospect, with lukewarmness within and bitter opposition without, our ancient brethren persevered. Let us leave them engaged in the good work, and whenever to
us, as to them, success is uncertain, remote, and contingent, let us still remember that the only question for us to ask, as true men and Masons, is what does duty require and not what will be the result and our
reward if we do our duty. Work on, the Sword in one hand, and the Trowel in the other!
Masonry teaches that God is a Paternal Being, and has an interest in his creatures, such as is expressed in the title Father; an interest unknown to all the systems of Paganism, untaught in all the theories of
philosophy; an interest not only in the glorious beings of other spheres, the Sons of Light, the dwellers in Heav enly worlds, but in us, poor, ignorant, and unworthy; that He has pity for the erring, pardon for
the guilty, love for the pure, knowledge for the humble, and promises of immortal life for those who trust in and obey Him.
Without a belief in Him, life is miserable, the world is dark, the Universe disrobed of its splendors, the
intellectual tie to nature broken, the charm of existence dissolved, the great hope of being lost; and the mind, like a star struck from its sphere, wanders through the infinite desert of its conceptions, without
attraction, tendency, destiny, or end.
Masonry teaches, that, of all the events and actions, that take place in the universe of worlds and the eternal succession of ages, there is not one, even the minutest, which God did not forever forsee with all
the distinctness of immediate vision, combining all, so that man's free will should be His instrument, like all the other forces of nature.
It teaches that the soul of man is formed by Him for a purpose; that, built up in its proportions, and
fashioned in every part, by infinite skill, an emanation from His spirit, its nature, necessity, and design are virtue. It is so formed, so moulded, so fashioned, so exactly balanced, so exquisitely proportioned in
every part, that sin introduced into it is misery; that vicious thoughts fall upon it like drops of poison; and guilty desires, breathing on its delicate fibres, make plaguespots there, deadly as those of
pestilence upon the body. It is made for virtue, and not for vice; for purity, as its end, rest, and happiness. Not more vainly would we attempt to make the mountain sink to the level of the valley, the
waves of the angry sea turn back from its shores and cease to thunder upon the beach, the stars to halt in their swift courses, than to change any one law of our own nature. And one of those laws, uttered by
God's voice, and speaking through every nerve and fibre, every force and element, of the moral constitution He has given us, is that we must be upright and virtuous; that if tempted we must resist;

that we must govern our unruly pas sions, and hold in hand our sensual appetites. And this is not the dictate of an arbitrary will, nor of some stern and impracticable law; but it is part of the great firm law
of harmony that binds the Universe together, not the mere enactment of arbitrary will; but the dictate of Infinite Wisdom.
We know that God is good, and that what He does is right. This known, the works of creation, the
changes of life, the destinies of eternity, are all spread before us, as the dispensations and counsels of infinite love. This known, we then know that the love of God is working to issues, like itself, beyond all
thought and imagination good and glorious; and that the only reason why we do not understand it, is that it is too glorious for us to un derstand. God's love takes care for all, and nothing is neglected. It
watches over all, provides for all, makes wise adaptations for all; for age, for infancy, for maturity, for childhood; in every scene of this or another world; for want, weakness, joy, sorrow, and even for sin. All
is good and well and right; and shall be so forever. Through the eternal ages the light of God's beneficence shall shine hereafter, disclosing all, consummating all, rewarding all that deserve reward.
Then we shall see, what now we can only believe.
The cloud will be lifted up, the gate of mystery be passed, and the full light shine forever; the light of which that of the Lodge is a symbol. Then that which caused us trial shall yield us triumph; and that
which made our heart ache shall fill us with gladness; and we shall then feel that there, as here, the only true happiness is to learn, to advance, and to improve; which could not happen unless we had
commenced with error, ignorance, and imperfection. We must pass through the darkness, to reach the light.
XVI. PRINCE OF JERUSALEM
We no longer expect to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. To us it has become but a symbol. To us the
whole world is God's Temple, as is every upright heart. To establish all over the world the New Law and Reign of Love, Peace, Charity, and Toleration, is to build that Temple, most acceptable to God, in
erecting which Masonry is now engaged. No longer needing to repair to Jerusa lem to worship, nor to offer up sacrifices and shed blood to propi tiate the Deity, man may make the woods and mountains his
Churches and Temples, and worship God with a devout gratitude, and with works of charity and beneficence to his fellow men.
Wherever the humble and contrite heart silently offers up its adoration, under the overarching trees, in
the open, level meadows, on the hillside, in the glen, or in the city's swarming streets; there is God's House and the New Jerusalem.
The Princes of Jerusalem no longer sit as magistrates to judge between the people; nor is their number

limited to five. But their duties still remain substantially the same, and their insignia and symbols retain their old significance. Justice and Equity are still their characteristics. To reconcile disputes and
heal dissensions, to restore amity and peace, to soothe dislikes and soften, prejudices, are their peculiar duties; and they know that the peacemakers are blessed.
Their emblems have been already explained. They are part of language of Masonry; the same now as it
was when Moses learned it from the Egyptian Hierophants. .
Still we observe the spirit of the Divine law, as thus enunciated to our ancient brethren, when the Temple was rebuilt, and the book of the law again opened: "Execute true judgment; and show mercy
and compassion every man to his brother. Oppress not the widow nor the fatherless, the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in his heart. Speak ye every man the truth to
his neighbor; execute the judgment of Truth and Peace in your gates; and love no false oath; for all these I hate, saith the Lord".
"Let those who have power rule in righteousness, and Princes in judgment. And let him that is a judge
be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place; as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Then the vile person shall no more be called liberal; nor the
churl bountiful; and the work of justice shall be peace; and the effect of justice, quiet and security; and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of the times. Walk ye righteously and speak uprightly;
despise the gains of oppression, shake from your hands the contamination of bribes; stop not your ears against the cries of the oppressed, nor shut your eyes that you may not see the crimes of the great; and
you shall dwell on high, and your place of defence be like munitions of rocks."
Forget not these precepts of the old Law and especially do not forget, as you advance, that every Mason, however humble, is your brother, and the laboring man your peer! Remember always that all Masonry is
work, and that the trowel is an emblem of the Degrees in this Council. Labor, when rightly understood, is both noble and ennobling, and intended to develop man's moral and spiritual nature, and not to be
deemed a disgrace or a misfortune.
Everything around us is, in its bearings and influences, moral. The serene and bright morning, when we recover our conscious existence from the embraces of sleep; when, from that image of Death God calls
us to a new life, and again gives us existence, and His mercies visit us in every bright ray and glad thought, and call for gratitude and content; the silence of that early dawn, the hushed silence, as it were,
of expectation; the holy eventide, its cooling breeze, its lengthening shadows, its falling shades, its still and sober hour; the sultry noontide and the stern and solemn midnight; and Springtime, and chastening
Autumn; and Sum mer, that unbars our gates, and carries us forth amidst the ever renewed wonders of the world; and Winter, that gathers us around the evening hearth; all these, as they pass, touch by turns

the springs of the spiritual life in us, and are conducting that life to good or evil. The idle watchhand often points to something within us; and the shadow of the gnomon on the dial often falls upon the
conscience.
A life of labor is not a state of inferiority or degradation. The Almighty has not cast man's lot beneath the quiet shades, and amid glad groves and lovely hills, with no task to perform; with nothing to do but
to rise up and eat, and to lie down and rest. He has ordained that Work shall be done, in all the dwellings of life, in every productive field, in every busy city, and on every wave of every ocean. And
this He has done, because it has plrased Him to give man a nature destined to higher ends than indolent repose and irresponsible profitless indulgence and because, for developing the energies of such a
nature, work was the necessary and proper element. We might as well ask why He could not make two and two be six, as why He could not develop these energies without the instrumentality of work. They
are equally impossibilities.
This Masonry teaches, as a great Truth; a great moral land mark, that ought to guide the course of all mankind. It teaches its toiling children that the scene of their daily life is all spiritual, that the very
implements of their toil, the fabrics they weave, the merchandise they barter, are designed for spiritual ends; that so believing, their daily lot may be to them a sphere for the noblest improvement. That which
we do in our intervals of relaxation, our churchgoing, and our book reading, are especially designed to prepare our minds for the action of Life. We are to hear and read and meditate, that we may act well and
the action of Life is itself the great field for spiritual improvement.
There is no task of industry or business, in field or forest, on the wharf or the ship's deck, in the office or the exchange, but has spiritual ends. There is no care or cross of our daily labor, but was especially
ordained to nurture in us patience, calmness, resolution, perseverance, gen tleness, disinterestedness, magnanimity. Nor is there any tool or implement of toil, but is a part of the great spiritual
instrumentality.
All the relations of life, those of parent, child, brother, sister, friend, associate, lover and beloved, husband, wife, are moral, throughout every living tie and thrilling nerve that blnd them together. They
cannot subsist a day nor an hour without putting the mind to a trial of its truth, fidelity, forbearance, and disinterestedness.
A great city is one extended scene of moral action. There is blow struck in it but has a purpose,
ultimately good or bad, and therefore moral. There is no action performed, but has a motive; and motives are the special jurisdiction of morality. Equipages, houses, and furniture are symbols of what is
moral, and they in a thousand ways minister to right or wrong feeling. Everything that belongs to us, ministering to our comfort or luxury, awakens in us emotions of pride or gratitude, of selfishness or

vanity; thoughts of selfindulgence, or merciful remembrances of the needy and the destitute.
Everything acts upon and influences us. God's great law of sympathy and harmony is potent and inflexible as His law of gravitation. A sentence embodying a noble thought stirs our blood; a noise
made by a child frets and exasperates us, and influences our actions.
A world of spiritual objects, influences, and relations lies around us all. We all vaguely deem it to be so; but he only lives a charmed life, like that of genius and poetic inspiration, who communes with the
spiritual scene around him, hears the voice of the spirit in every sound, sees its signs in every passing form of things, and feels its impulse in all action, passion, and being. Very near to us lies the mines of
wisdom; unsuspected they lie all around us. There is a secret in the simplest things, a wonder in the plainest, a charm in the dullest.
We are all naturally seekers of wonders. We travel far to see the majesty of old ruins, the venerable
forms of the hoary mountains, great waterfalls, and galleries of art. And yet the world wonder is all around us; the wonder of setting suns and evening stars, of the magic springtime, the blossoming of the
trees, the strange transformations of the moth; the wonder of the Infinite Divinity and of His boundless revelation. There is no splendor beyond that which sets its morning throne in the golden East; no dome
sublime as that of Heaven; no beauty so fair as that of the verdant, blossoming earth; no place, however invested with the sanctities of old time, like that home which is hushed and folded within the embrace
of the humblest wall and roof.
And all these are but the symbols of things far greater and higher. All is but the clothing of the spirit. In this vesture of time is wrapped the immortal nature: in this show of circumstance and form stands
revealed the stupendous reality. Let man but be, as he is, a living soul, communing with himself and with God, and his vision becomes eternity; his abode, infinity; his home, the bosom of all embracing
love.
The great problem of Humanity is wrought out in the humblest abodes; no more than this is done in the highest. A human heart throbs beneath the beggar's gabardine; and that and no more stirs with its
beating the Prince's mantle. The beauty of Love, the charm of Friendship, the sacredness of Sorrow, the heroism of Patience, the noble Selfsacrifice, these and their like, alone, make life to be life indeed,
and are its grandeur and its power. They are the priceless treasures and glory of humanity; and they are not things of condition. All places and all scenes are alike clothed with the grandeur and charm of
virtues such as these.
The million occasions will come to us all, in the ordinary paths of our life, in our homes, and by our firesides, wherein we may act as nobly, as if, all our life long, we led armies, sat in senates, or visited

beds of sickness and pain. Varying every hour, the million occasions will come in which we may restrain our pas sions, subdue our hearts to gentleness and patience, resign our own interst for another's
advantage, speak words of kindness and wisdom, raise the fallen, cheer the fainting and sick in spirit, and soften and assuage the weariness and bitterness of their mortal lot. To every Mason there will be
opportunity enough for these. They cannot be written on his tomb;but they will be written deep in the hearts of men, of friends, of children, of kindred all around him, in the book of the great account, and
in their eternal influences, on the great pages of the Universe.
To such a destiny, at least, my Brethren, let us all aspire! These laws of Masonry let us all strive to obey! And so may our hearts become true temples of the Living God! And may He encourage our zeal,
sustain our hopes, and assure us of success!
XVII. KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST
This is the first of the Philosophical Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite and the
beginning of a course of instruction which will fully unveil to you the heart and inner mysteries of Masonry. Do not despair because you have often seemed on the point of attaining the inmost light, and
have as often been disappointed. In all time, truth has been hidden under symbols, and often under a succession of allegories: where veil after veil had to be penetrated before the true Light was reached
and the essential truth stood revealed. The Human Light is but an imperfect reflection of a ray of the Infinite and Divine.
We are about to approach those ancient Religions which once ruled the minds of men, and whose ruins
encumber the plains of the great Past, as the broken columns of Palmyra and Tadmor lie bleaching on the sands of the desert. They rise before us, those old, strange, mysterious creeds and faiths, shrouded
in the mists of antiquity, and stalk dimly and undefined along the line which divides Time from Eternity; and forms of strange, wild, startling beauty mingled in the vast throngs of figures with shapes
mon strous, grotesque, and hideous.
The religion taught by Moses, which, like the laws of Egypt, enuciated the principle of exclusion, borrowed, at every period of its existence, from all the creeds with which it came in contact. While, by
the studies of the learned and wise, it enriched itself with the most admirable principles of the religions of Egypt and Asia, it was changed, in the wanderings of the People, by every thing that was most
impure or seductive in the pagan manners and superstitions. It was one thing in the times of Moses and Aaron, another in those of David and Solomon, and still another in those of Daniel and Philo.

At the time when John the Baptist made his appearance in the desert, near the shores of the Dead Sea, all the old philosophical and religious systems were approximating toward each other. A general
lassitude inclined the minds of all toward the quietude of that amalgamation of doctrines for which the expeditions of Alexander and the more peaceful occurrences that followed, with the establishment in
Asia and Africa of many Grecian dynasties and a great number of Grecian colonies, had prepared the way. After the intermingling of different nations, which resulted from the wars of Alexander in three
quarters of the globe, the doctrines of Greece, of Egypt, of Persia, and of India, met and intermingled everywhere. All the barriers that had formerly kept the nations apart, were thrown down and while the
People of the West readily connected their faith with those of the East, those of the Orient hastened to learn the traditions of Rome and the legends of Athens. While the Philosophers of Greece, all (except
the dis ciples of Epicurus) more or less Platonists, seized eargerly upon the beliefs and doctrines of the East, the Jews and Egyptians, before then the most exclusive of all peoples, yielded to that eclecticism
which prevailed among their masters, the Greeks and Romans.
Under the same influences of toleration, even those who embraced Christianity, mingled together the old and the new, Christianity and Philosophy, the Apostolic teachings and the traditions of Mythology.
The man of intellect, devotee of one system, rarely displaces it with another in all its purity. The people take such a creed as is offered them.
Accordingly, the distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric doctrine, immemorial in other creeds,
easily gained a foothold among many of the Christians; and it was held by a vast number, even during the preaching of Paul, that the writings of the Apostles were incomplete; that they contained only the
germs of another doctrine, which must receive from the hands of philosophy, not only the systematic arrangement which was wanting, but all the development which lay concealed therein. The writings of
the Apostles, they said, in addressing themselves to mankind in general, enunciated only the articles of the vulgar faith; but transmitted the mysteries of knowledge to superior minds, to the Elect, mysteries
handed down from generation to generation in esoteric traditions and to this science of the mysteries they gave the name of Gnosis.
The Gnostics derived their leading doctrines and ideas from Plato and Philo, the Zendavesta and the
Kabalah, and the Sacred books of India and Egypt; and thus introduced into the bosom of Christianity the cosmological and theosophical speculations, which had formed the larger portion of the ancient
religions of the Orient, joined to those of the Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish doctrines, which the Neo Platonists had equally adopted in the Occident.
Emanation from the Deity of all spiritual beings, progressive degeneration of these beings from
emanation to emanation, redemption and return of all to the purity of the Creator and, after the re establishment of the primitive harmony of all, a fortunate and truly divine condition of all, in the bosom
of God; such were the fundamental teachings of Gnosticism. The genius of the Orient, with its
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



191/641
contemplations, irradiations, and intuitions, dictated its doctrines. Its language corresponded to its origin. Full of imagery, it had all the magnificence, the inconsistencies, and the mobility of the
figurative style.
Behold, it said, the light, which emanates from an immense centre of Light, that spreads everywhere its benevolent rays; so do the spirits of Light emanate from the Divine Light. Behold, all the springs
which nourish, embellish, fertilize, and purify the Earth; they emanate from one and the same ocean; so from the bosom of the Divinity emanate so many streams, which form and fill the universe of
intelligences. Behold numbers, which all emanate from one primitive number, all resemble it, all are composed of its essence, and still vary infinitely; and utterances, decomposable into so many syllables
and elements, all contained in the primitive Word, and still infinitely various; so the world of Intelligences emanated from a Primary Intelligence, and they all resemble it, and yet display an infinite
variety of existences.
It revived and combined the old doctrines of the Orient and the Occident; and it found in many passages of the Gospels and the Pastoral letters, a warrant for doing so. Christ himself spoke in
parables and allegories, John borrowed the enigmatical language of the Platonists, and Paul often indulged in incomprehensible rhapsodies, the meaning of which could have been clear to the Initiates
alone.
It is admitted that the cradle of Gnosticism is probably to be looked for in Syria, and even in Palestine. Most of its expounders wrote in that corrupted form of the Greek used by the Hellenistic Jews, and in
the Septuagint and the New Testament; and there is a striking analogy between their doctrines and those of the JudaeoEgyptian Philo, of Alexandria; itself the seat of three schools, at once philosophic and
religious the Greek, the Egyptian, and the Jewish.
Pythagoras and Plato, the most mystical of the Grecian Philosophers (the latter heir to the doctrines of the former), and who had travelled, the latter in Egypt, and the former in Phoenicia, India, and Persia,
also taught the esoteric doctrine and the distinction between the initiated and the profane. The dominant doctrines of Platonism were found in Gnosticism. Emanation of Intelligences from the
bosom of the Deity; the going astray in error and the sufferings of spirits, so long as they are remote from God, and imprisoned in matter; vain and long continued efforts to arrive at the knowledge of the
Truth, and reenter into their primitive union with the Supreme Being; alliance of a pure and divine soul with an irrational soul, the seat of evil desires; angels or demons who dwell in and govern the
planets, having but an imperfect knowledge of the ideas that presided at the creation; regeneration of all beings by their return to the kosmos noetos, the world of Intelligences, and its Chief, the Supreme
Being; sole possible mode of reestablishing that primitive harmony of the creation, of which the music of the spheres of Pythagoras was the image; these were the analogies of the two systems and we
discover in them some of the ideas that form a part of Masonry; in which, in the present mutilated

192/641
condition of the symbolic Degrees, they are disguised and overlaid with fiction and absurdity, or present themselves as casual hints that are passed by wholly unnoticed.
The distinction between the esoteric and exoteric doctrines (a distinction purely Masonic), was always
and from the very earliest times preserved among the Greeks. It remounted to the fabulous times of Orpheus and the mysteries of Theosophy were found in all their traditions and myths. And after the
time of Alexander, they resorted for instruction, dogmas, and mysteries, to all the schools, to those of Egypt and Asia, as well as those of Ancient Thrace, Sicily, Etruria, and Attica.
The JewishGreek School of Alexandria is known only by two of its Chiefs, Aristobulus and Philo, both
Jews of Alexandria in Egypt. Belonging to Asia by its origin, to Egypt by its residence, to Greece by its language and studies, it strove to show that all truths embedded in the philosophies of other countries
were transplanted thither from Palestine. Aristobulus declared that all the facts and details of the Jewish Scriptures were so many allegories, concealing the most profound meanings, and that Plato had
borrowed from them all his finest ideas.
Philo, who lived a century after him, following the same theory, endeavored to show that the Hebrew writings, by their system of allegories, were the true source of all religious and philosophical doctrines.
According to him, the literal meaning is for the vulgar alone. Whoever has meditated on philosophy, purified himself by virtue, and raised himself by contemplation, to God and the intellectual world, and
received their inspiration, pierces the gross envelope of the letter, discovers a wholly different order of things, and is initiated into mysteries, of which the elementary or literal instruction offers but an
imperfect image. A historical fact, a figure, a word, a letter, a number, a rite, a custom, the parable or vision of a prophet, veils the most profound truths; and he who has the key of science will interpret all
according to the light he possesses.
Again we see the symbolism of Masonry, and the search of the Candidate for light. "Let men of narrow minds withdraw," he says, "with closed ears. We transmit the divine mysteries to those who have
received the sacred initiation, to those who practise true piety and who are not enslaved by the empty trappings of words or the preconceived opinions of the pagans."
To Philo, the Supreme Being was the Primitive Light, or the Archetype of Light, Source whence the
rays emanate that illuminate Souls. He was also the Soul of the Universe, and as such acted in all its parts. He Himself fills and limits His whole Being. His Powers and Virtues fill and penetrate all. These
Powers (dunameis) are Spirits distinct from God, the "Ideas" of Plato personified. He is without beginning, and lives in the prototype of Time (aion).
His image is THE WORD, a form more brilliant than fire; that not being the pure light. This LOGOS

193/641
dwells in God; for the Supreme Being makes to Himself within His Intelligence the types or ideas of everything that is to become reality in this World. The LOGOS is the vehicle by which God acts on the
Universe, and may be compared to the speech of man.
The LOGOS being the World of Ideas, by means whereof God has created visible things, He is the most ancient God, in comparison with the World, which is the youngest production. The LOGOS, Chief
of Intelligence, of which He is the general representative, is named Archangel, type and representative of all spirits, even those of mortals. He is also styled the mantype and primitive man, Adam Kadmon.
God only is Wise. The wisdom of man is but the reflection and image of that of God. He is the Father,
and His WISDOM the mother of creation; for He united Himself with WISDOM (Sophia), and communicated to it the germ of creation, and it brought forth the material world. He created the ideal
world only, and caused the material world to be made real after its type, by His LOGOS, which is His speech, and at the same time the Idea of Ideas, the Intellectual World. The Intellectual City was but the
Thought of the Architect, who meditated the creation, accord ing to that plan of the Material City.
The Word is not only the Creator, but occupies the place of the Supreme Being. Through Him all the Powers and Attributes of God act. On the other side, as first representative of the Human Family, He is
the Protector of men and their Shepherd.
God gives to man the Soul or Intelligence, which exists before the body, and which he unites with the body. The reasoning Principle comes from God through the Word, and communes with God and with
the Word; but there is also in man an irrational Principle, that of the inclinations and passions which produce disorder, emanating from inferior spirits who fill the air as ministers of God. The body, taken
from the Earth, and the irrational Principle that animates it concurrently with the rational Principle, are hated by God, while the rational soul which He has given it, is, as it were, captive in this prison, this
coffin, that encompasses it.
The present condition of man is not his primitive condition, when he was the image of the Logos. He has fallen from his first estate. But he may raise himself again, by following the directions of
WISDOM and of the Angels which God has commissioned to aid him in freeing himself from the bonds of the body, and combating Evil, the existence whereof God has permitted, to furnish him the
means of exercising his liberty. The souls that are purified, not by the Law but by light, rise to the Heavenly regions, to enjoy there a perfect felicity. Those that persevere in evil go from body to body,
the seats of passions and evil desires. The familiar lineaments of these doctrines will be recognized by all who read the Epistles of St. Paul, who wrote after Philo, the latter living till the reign of Caligula,
and being the contemporary of Christ.

And the Mason is familiar with these doctrines of Philo: that the Supreme Being is a centre of Light whose rays or emanations pervade the Universe; for that is the Light for which all Masonic journeys are
a search, and of which the sun and moon in our Lodges are only emblems: that Light and Darkness, chief enemies from the beginning of Time, dispute with each other the empire of the world; which we
symbolize by the candidate wandering in darkness and being brought to light: that the world was created, not by the Supreme Being, but by a secondary agent, who is but His WORD, and by types
which are but his ideas, aided by an INTELLIGENCE, or WISDOM, which gives one of His Attributes; in which we see the occult meaning of the ne cessity of recovering "the Word"; and of our
two columns of STRENGTH and WISDOM, which are also the two parallel lines that bound the circle representing the Universe: that the visible world is the image of the invisible world; that the essence of
the Human Soul is the image of God, and it existed before the body; that the object of its terrestrial life is to disengage itself of its body or its sepulchre; and that it will ascend to the Heavenly regions
whenever it shall be purified; in which we see the meaning, now almost forgotten in our Lodges, of the mode of preparation of the candidate for apprenticeship, and his tests and purifications in the first
Degree, according to the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.
Philo incorporated in his eclecticism neither Egyptian nor Oriental elements. But there were other Jewish Teachers in Alexandria who did both. The Jews of Egypt were slightly jealous of, and a little
hostile to, those of Palestine, particularly after the erection of the sanctuary at Leontopolis by the High Priest Onias; and therefore they admired and magnified those sages, who, like Jeremiah, had resided in
Egypt. "The wisdom of Solomon" was written at Alexandria, and, in the time of St. Jerome, was attributed to Philo; but it contains principles at variance with his. It personifies Wisdom, and draws
between its children and the Profane, the same line of demarcation that Egypt had long before taught to the Jews. That distinction existed at the beginning of the Mosaic creed. Moshah himself was an Initiate
in the mysteries of Egypt, as he was compelled to be, as the adopted son of the daughter of Pharaoh, Thouoris, daughter of SesostrisRamses; who, as her tomb and monuments show, was, in the right of
her infant husband, Regent of Lower Egypt or the Delta at the time of the Hebrew Prophet's birth, reigning at Heliopolis. She was also, as the reliefs on her tomb show, a Priestess of HATHOR and
NEITH, the two great primeval goddesses. As her adopted son, living in her Palace and presence forty years, and during that time scarcely acquainted with his brethren the Jews, the law of Egypt compelled
his initiation: and we find in many of his enactments the intention of preserving, between the common people and the Initiates, the line of separation which he found in Egypt. Moshah and Aharun his
brother, the whole series of HighPriests, the Council of the 70 Elders, Salomoh and the entire succession of Prophets, were in possession of a higher science; and of that science Masonry is, at least,
the lineal descendant. It was famili arly known as THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORD.
AMUN, at first the God of Lower Egypt only, where Moshah was reared (a word that in Hebrew means Truth), was the Su preme God. He was styled "the Celestial Lord, who sheds Light on hidden things."
He was the source of that divine life, of which the crux ansata is the symbol; and the source of all power. He united all the attributes that the Ancient Oriental Theosophy assigned to the Supreme Being.
He was the Pleroma, or "Fullness of things," for He comprehended in Himself everything and the

LIGHT; for he was the SunGod. He was unchangeable in the midst of everything phenomenal in his worlds. He created nothing; but everything emanated from Him; and of Him all the other Gods were but
manifestations.
The Ram was His living symbol which you see reproduced in this Degree, lying on the book with seven seals on the tracing board. He caused the creation of the world by the Primitive Thought (Ennoia), or
Spirit (Pneuma), that issued from him by means of his Voice or the WORD; and which Thought or Spirit was personified as the Goddess NEITH. She, too, was a divinity of Light, and mother of the
Sun; and the Feast of Lamps was celebrated in her honor at Sais. The Creative Power, another manifestation of Deity, proceeding to the creation conceived of in her, the Divine Intelligence, produced
with its Word the Universe, symbolized by an egg issuing from the mouth of KNEPH; from which egg came PHTHA, image of the Supreme Intelligence as realized in the world, and the type of that
manifested in man; the principal agent, also, of Nature, or the creative and productive Fire. PHRE or RS, the Sun, or Celestial Light, whose symbol was the point within a circle, was the son of PHTHA;
and TIPHE, his wife, or the celestial firmament, with the seven celestial bodies, animated by spirits of genii that govern them, was represented on many of the monuments, clad in blue or yellow, her
garments sprinkled with stars, and accompanied by the sun, moon, and five planets; and she was the type of Wisdom, and they of the Seven Planetary Spirits of the Gnostics, that with her presided over
and governed the sublunary world.
In this Degree, unknown for a hundred years to those who have practised it, these emblems reproduced refer to these old doctrines. The lamb, the yellow hangings strewed with stars, the seven columns,
candlesticks, and seals all recall them to us.
The Lion was the symbol of ATHOMRE, the Great God of Upper Egypt; the Hawk, of RA or PHRE; the Eagle, of MENDES; the Bull, of APIS; and three of these are seen under the platform on which our
altar stands.
The first HERMES was the INTELLIGENCE, or WORD of God. Moved with compassion for a race living without law, and wishing to teach them that they sprang from His bosom, and to point out to
them the way that they should go (the books which the first Hermes, the same with Enoch, had written on the mysteries of divine science, in the sacred characters, being unknown to those who lived after the
flood), God sent to man OSIRIS and ISIS, ac accompanied by THOTH, the incarnation or terrestrial repetition of the first Hermes; who taught men the arts, science, and the ceremonies of religion; and
then ascended to Heaven or the Moon. OSIRIS was the Principle of Good. TYPHON, like AHRIMAN, was the principle and source of all that is evil in the moral and physi cal order. Like the Satan of
Gnosticism, he was confounded with Matter.

From Egypt or Persia the new Platonists borrowed the idea, and the Gnostics received it from them, that man, in his terrestrial career, is successively under the influence of the Moon, of Mercury, of Venus, of
the Sun, of Mars, of Jupiter, and of Saturn, until he finally reaches the Elysian Fields; an idea again symbolized in the Seven Seals.
The Jews of Syria and Judea were the direct precursors of Gnosticism; and in their doctrines were
ample oriental elements. These Jews had had with the Orient, at two different periods, intimate relations, familiarizing them with the doctrines of Asia, and especially of Chaldea and Persia; their
forced residence in Central Asia under the Assyrians and Persians; and their voluntary dispersion over the whole East, when subjects of the Seleucidae and the Romans. Living near twothirds of a century,
and many of them long afterward, in Mesopotamia, the cradle of their race; speaking the same language, and their children reared with those of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Medes, and Persians, and
receiving from them their names (as the case of Danayal, who was called Baeltasatsar, proves), they necessarily adopted many of the doctrines of their conquerors. Their descendants, as Azra and
Nahamaiah show us, hardly desired to leave Persia, when they were allowed to do so. They had a special jurisdiction, and governors and judges taken from their own people; many of them held high
office, and their children were educated with those of the highest nobles. Danayal was the friend and minister of the King, and the Chief of the College of the Magi at Babylon; if we may believe the book
which bears his name, and trust to the incidents related in its highly figurative and imaginative style. Mordecai, too, occupied a high station, no less than that of Prime Minister, and Esther or Astar, his
cousin, was the Monarch's wife.
The Magi of Babylon were expounders of figurative writings, interpreters of nature, and of dreams, astronomers and divines; and from their influences arose among the Jews, after their rescue from
captivity, a number of sects, and a new exposition, the mystical interpretation, with all its wild fancies and infinite caprices. The Aions of the Gnostics, the Ideas of Plato, the Angels of the Jews, and the
Demons of the Greeks, all correspond to the Ferouers of Zoroaster.
A great number of Jewish families remained permanently in their new country; and one of the most celebrated of their schools was at Babylon. They were soon familiarized with the doctrine of Zoroaster,
which itself was more ancient than Kuros. From the system of the ZendAvesta they borrowed, and subsequently gave large development to, everything that could be reconciled with their own faith; and
these additions to the old doctrine were soon spread, by the constant intercourse of commerce, into Syria and Palestine.
In the ZendAvesta, God is Illimitable Time. No origin can be assigned to Him: He is so entirely
enveloped in His glory, His nature and attributes are so inaccessible to human Intelligence, that He can be only the object of a silent Veneration. Creation took place by emanation from Him. The first
emanation was the primitive Light, and from that the King of Light, ORMUZD. By the "WORD,"

Ormuzd created the world pure. He is its pre server and Judge; a Being Holy and Heavenly; Intelligence and Knowledge; the Firstborn of Time without limits; and invested with all the Powers of
the Supreme Being.
Still he is, strictly speaking, the Fourth Being. He had a Ferouer, a preexisting Soul (in the language of Plato, a type or ideal); and it is said of Him, that He existed from the beginning, in the primitive
Light. But, that Light being but an element, and His Ferouer a type, he is, in ordinary language, the Firstborn of ZEROUANEAKHERENE. Behold again "THE WORD" of Masonry; the Man, on the
TracingBoard of this Degree; the LIGHT toward which all Masons travel.
He created after his own image, six Genii called Amshaspands, who surround his Throne, are his organs of communication with inferior spirits and men, transmit to Him their prayers, solicit for them
His favors, and serve them as models of purity and perfection. Thus we have the Demiourgos of Gnosticism, and the six Genii that assist him. These are the Hebrew Archangels of the Planets.
The names of these Amshaspands are Bahman, Ardibehest, Schariver, Sapandomad, Khordad, and
Amerdad. The fourth, the Holy SAPANDOMAD, created the first man and woman.
Then ORMUZD created 28 Iseds, of whom MITHERAS is the chief. They watch, with Ormuzd and the Amshaspands, over the happiness, purity, and preservation of the world, which is under their
government; and they are also models for mankind and interpreters of men's prayers. With Mithras and Ormuzd, they make a pleroma (or complete number) of 30, corresponding to the thirty Aions of the
Gnostics, and to the ogdoade, dodecade, and decade of the Egyptians. Mithras was the SunGod, invoked with, and soon confounded with him, becoming the object of a special worship, and eclipsing
Ormuzd himself.
The third order of pure spirits is more numerous. They are the Ferouers, the THOUGHTS of Ormuzd, or the IDEAS which he conceived before proceeding to the creation of things. They too are superior to
men. They protect them during their life on earth; they will purify them from evil at their resurrection. They are their tutelary genii, from the fall to the complete regeneration.
AHRIMAN, secondborn of the Primitive Light, emanated from it, pure like ORMUZD; but, proud and
ambitious, yielded to jeal ousy of the Firstborn. For his hatred and pride, the Eternal condemned him to dwell, for 12,000 years, in that part of space where no ray of light reaches; the black empire of
darkness. In that period the struggle between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil will be terminated.
AHRIMAN scorned to submit, and took the field against ORMUZD. To the good spirits created by his

Brother, he opposed an innumerable army of Evil Ones. To the seven Amshaspands he opposed seven Archdevs, attached to the seven Planets; to the Izeds and Ferouers an equal number of Devs, which
brought upon the world all moral and physical evils. Hence Poverty, Maladies, Impurity, Envy, Chagrin, Drunkenness, Falsehood, Calumny, and their horrible array.
The image of Ahriman was the Dragon, confounded by the Jews with Satan and the Serpent Tempter.
After a reign of 3000 years, Ormuzd had created the Material World, in six periods, calling successively into existence the Light, Water, Earth, plants, animals, and Man. But Ahriman concurred
in creatmg the earth and water; for darkness was already an element, and Ormuzd could not exclude its Master. So also the two concurred in producing Man. Ormuzd produced, by his Will and Word, a
Being that was the type and source of universal life for everything that exists under Heaven. He placed in man a pure principle, or Life, proceeding from the Supreme Being. But Ahriman destroyed that pure
principle, in the form wherewith it was clothed; and when Ormuzd had made, of its recovered and purified essence, the first man and woman, Ahriman seduced and tempted them with wine and fruits;
the woman yielding first.
Often, during the three latter periods of 3000 years each, Ahriman and Darkness are, and are to be, triumphant. But the pure souls are assisted by the Good Spirits; the Triumph of Good is decreed by the
Supreme Being, and the period of that triumph will infallibly arrive. When the world shall be most afflicted with the evils poured out upon it by the spirits of perdition, three Prophets will come to bring
relief to mortals. SOSIOSCH, the principal of the Three, will regenerate the earth, and restore to it its primitive beauty, strength, and purity. He will judge the good and the wicked. After the universal
resurrection of the good, he will conduct them to a home of everlasting happiness. Ahriman, his evil demons, and all wicked men, will also be purified in a tor rent of melted metal. The law of Ormuzd
will reign everywhere; all men will be happy; all, enjoying unalterable bliss, will sing with Sosiosch the praises of the Supreme Being.
These doctrines, the details of which were sparingly borrowed by the Pharisaic Jews, were much more
fully adopted by the Gnostics; who taught the restoration of all things, their return to their original pure condition, the happiness of those to be saved, and their admission to the feast of Heavenly Wisdom.
The doctrines of Zoroaster came originally from Bactria, an Indian Province of Persia. Naturally,
therefore, it would include Hindu or Buddhist elements, as it did. The fundamental idea of Buddhism was, matter subjugating the intelligence, and intelligence freeing itself from that slavery. Perhaps
something came to Gnosticism from China. "Before the chaos which preceded the birth of Heaven and Earth," says LaoTseu, "a single Being existed, immense and silent, immovable and ever active the
mother of the Universe. I know not its name: but I designate it by the word Reason. Man has his type and model in the Earth; Earth in Heaven; Heaven in Reason; and Reason in Itself." Here again are the

of the Gnostics.
The dominant system among the Jews after their captivity was that of the Pharoschim or Pharisees. Whether their name was derived from that of the Parsees, or followers of Zoroaster, or from some other
source, it is certain that they had borrowed much of their doctrine from the Persians. Like them they claimed to have the exclusive and mysterious knowledge, unknown to the mass. Like them they taught
that a constant war was waged between the Empire of Good and that of Evil. Like them they attributed the sin and fall of man to the demons and their chief; and like them they admitted a special protection
of the righteous by inferior beings, agents of Jehovah. All their doctrines on these subjects were at bottom those of the Holy Books; but singularly developed and the Orient was evidently the source from
which those developments came.
They styled themselves Interpreters; a name indicating their claim to the exclusive possession of the true meaning of the Holy Writings, by virtue of the oral tradition which Moses had re ceived on Mount
Sinai, and which successive generations of Ini tiates had transmitted, as they claimed, unaltered, unto them. Their very costume, their belief in the influences of the stars, and in the immortality and
transmigration of souls, their system of angels and their astronomy, were all foreign.
Sadduceeism arose merely from an opposition essentially Jewish, to these foreign teachings, and that mixture of doctrines, adopted by the Pharisees, and which constituted the popular creed.
We come at last to the Essenes and Therapeuts, with whom this Degree is particularly concerned. That
intermingling of oriental and occidental rites, of Persian and Pythagorean opinions, which we have pointed out in the doctrines of Philo, is unmistakable in the creeds of these two sects.
They were less distinguished by metaphysical speculations than by simple meditations and moral
practices. But the latter always partook of the Zoroastrian principle, that it was necessary to free the soul from the trammels and influences of matter; which led to a system of abstinence and maceration
entirely opposed to the ancient Hebrai cideas, favorable as they were to physical pleasures.
In general, the life and manners of these mystical associations, as Philo and Josephus describe them, and particularly their prayers at sunrise, seem the image of what the ZendAvesta pre scribes to the
faithful adorer or Ormuzd; and some of their observances cannot otherwise be explained.
The Therapeuts resided in Egypt, in the neighborhood of Alexandria and the Essenes in Palestine, in the vicinity of the Dead Sea. But there was nevertheless a striking coincidence in their ideas, readily
explained by attributing it to a foreign influence. The Jews of Egypt, under the influence of the School

200/641
of Alexan dria, endeavored in general to make their doctrines harmonize with the traditions of Greece and thence came, in the doctrines of the Therapeuts, as stated by Philo, the many analogies between the
Pythagorean and Orphic ideas, on one side and those of Judaism on the other: while the Jews of Palestine, having less communication with Greece, or contemning its teachings, rather imbibed the
Oriental doctrines, which they drank in at the source and with which their relations with Persia made them familiar. This attachment was particularly shown in the Kabalah, which belonged rather to
Palestine than to Egypt, though extensively known in the latter; and furnished the Gnostics with some of their most striking theories.
It is a significant fact, that while Christ spoke often of the Pharisees and Sadducees, He never once
mentioned the Essenes, between whose doctrines and His there was so great a resemblance, and, in many points, so perfect an identity. Indeed, they are not named, nor even distinctly alluded to,
anywhere in the New Testament. John, the son of a Priest who ministered in the Temple at Jerusalem, and whose mother was of the family of Aharun, was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto
Israel. He drank neither wine nor strong drink. Clad in haircloth, and with a girdle of leather, and feeding upon such food as the desert afforded, he preached, in the country about Jordan, the baptism of
repentance, for the remission of sins; that is, the necessity of repentance proven by reformation. He taught the people charity and liberality; the publicans, justice, equity, and fair dealing; the soldiery
peace, truth, and contentment; to do violence to none, accuse none falsely, and be content with their pay. He inculcated necessity of a virtuous life, and the folly of trusting to their descent from Abraham.
He denounced both Pharisees and Sadducees as a generation of vipers threatened with the anger of
God. He baptized those who confessed their sins. He preached in the desert; and therefore in the country where the Essenes lived, professing the same doctrines. He was imprisoned before Christ began
to preach. Matthew mentions him without preface or explanation; as if, apparently, his history was too well known to need any. "In those days," he says, "came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
of Judea." His disciples frequently fasted; for we find them with the Pharisees coming to Jesus to inquire why His Disciples did not fast as often as they; and He did not denounce them, as His habit was
to denounce the Pharisees; but answered them kindly and gently.
From his prison, John sent two of his disciples to inquire of Christ: "Art thou he that is to come, or do we look for another?" Christ referred them to his miracles as an answer and declared to the people that
John was a prophet, and more than a prophet, and that no greater man had ever been born; but that the humblest Christian was his superior. He declared him to be Elias, who was to come.
John had denounced to Herod his marriage with his brother's wife as unlawful; and for this he was
imprisoned, and finally executed to gratify her. His disciples buried him; and Herod and others thought he had risen from the dead and appeared again in the person of Christ. The people all regarded John as
a prophet; and Christ silenced the Priests and Elders by asking them whether he was inspired. They

201/641
feared to excite the anger of the people by saying that he was not. Christ declared that he came "in the way of righteousness" and that the lower classes
believed him, though the Priests and Pharisees did not.
Thus John, who was often consulted by Herod and to whom that monarch showed great deference and was often governed by his advice; whose doctrine prevailed very extensively among the people and the
publicans, taught some creed older than Christianity. That is plain: and it is equally plain, that the very large body of the Jews that adopted his doctrines, were neither Pharisees nor Sadducees, but the
humble, common people. They must, therefore, have been Essenes. It is plain, too, that Christ applied for baptism as a sacred rite, well known and long practiced. It was becoming to him, he said, to fulfill
all righteousness.
In the 18th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we read thus: "And a certain Jew, named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man was
instructed in the way of the Lord, and, being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John; and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue; whom,
when Aquilla and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."
Translating this from the symbolic and figurative language into the true ordinary sense of the Greek
text, it reads thus: "And a certain Jew, named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and of extensive learning, came to Ephesus. He had learned in the mysteries the true doctrine in regard to
God; and, being a zealous enthusiast, he spoke and taught diligently the truths in regard to the Deity, having received no other baptism than that of John." He knew nothing in regard to Christianity; for he
had resided in Alexandria, and had just then come to Ephesus; being, probably, a disciple of Philo, and a Therapeut.
"That, in all times," says St. Augustine, "is the Christian religion, which to know and follow is the most
sure and certain health, called according to that name, but not according to the thing itself, of which it is the name; for the thing itself, which is now called the Christian religion, really was known to the An
cients, nor was wanting at any time from the beginning of the human race, until the time when Christ came in the flesh; from whence the true religion, which had previously existed, began to be called
Christian; and this in our days is the Christian religion, not as having been wanting in former times, but as having, in later times, received this name." The disciples were first called "Christians," at Antioch,
when Barnabas and Paul began to preach there.
The Wandering or Itinerant Jews or Exorcists, who assumed to employ the Sacred Name in exorcising evil spirits, were no doubt Therapeutae or Essenes.

"And it came to pass," we read in the 19th chapter of the Acts, verses 1 to 4, "that while Apollos was at
Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper parts of Asia Minor, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples, he said to them, 'Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye became Believers?' And
they said unto him, 'We have not so much as heard that there is any Holy Ghost.' And he said to them, 'In what, then, were you baptized?' And they said 'In John's baptism.' Then said Paul, 'John indeed
baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in Him who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus Christ. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus."
This faith, taught by John, and so nearly Christianity, could have been nothing but the doctrine of the Essenes; and there can be no doubt that John belonged to that sect. The place where he preached, his
macerations and frugal diet, the doctrines he taught, all prove it conclusively. There was no other sect to which he could have belonged; certainly none so numerous as his, except the Essenes.
We find, from the two letters written by Paul to the brethren at Corinth, that City of Luxury and
Corruption, that there were contentions among them. Rival sects had already, about the 57th year of our era, reared their banners there, as followers, some of Paul, some of Apollos, and some of Cephas.
Some of them denied the resurrection. Paul urged them to adhere to the doctrines taught by himself, and had sent Timothy to them to bring them afresh to their recollection.
According to Paul, Christ was to come again. He was to put an end to all other Principalities and
Powers, and finally to Death, and then be Himself once more merged in God; who should then be all in all.
The forms and ceremonies of the Essenes were symbolical. They had, according to Philo the Jew, four
Degrees; the members being divided into two Orders, the Practici and Therapeutici; the latter being the contemplative and medical Brethren; and the former the active, practical, business men. They were
Jews by birth; and had a greater affection for each other than the mem bers of any other sect. Their brotherly love was intense. They fulfilled the Christian law, "Love one another." They despised riches.
No one was to be found among them, having more than another. The possessions of one were intermingled with those of the others; so that they all had but one patrimony, and were brethren. Their
piety toward God was extraordinary. Before sunrise they never spake a word about profane matters; but put up certain prayers which they had received from their forefathers. At dawn of day, and before it was
light, their prayers and hymns ascended to Heaven. They were eminently faithful and true, and the Ministers of Peace. They had mysterious ceremonies, and initiations into their mysteries; and the
Candidate promised that he would ever practise fidelity to all men, and especially to those in authority, "because no one obtains the government without God's assistance."

Whatever they said, was firmer than an oath; but they avoided swearing, and esteemed it worse than
perjury. They were simple in their diet and mode of living, bore torture with fortitude, and despised death. They cultivated the science of medicine and were very skillful. They deemed it a good omen to
dress in white robes. They had their own courts, and passed righteous judgments. They kept the Sabbath more rigorously than the Jews.
Their chief towns were Engaddi, near the Dead Sea, and Hebron. Engaddi was about 30 miles southeast
from Jerusalem, and Hebron about 20 miles south of that city. Josephus and Eusebius speak of them as an ancient sect; and they were no doubt the first among the Jews to embrace Christianity: with whose
faith and doctrine their own tenets had so many points of resemblance, and were indeed in a great measure the same. Pliny regarded them as a very ancient people.
In their devotions they turned toward the rising sun; as the Jews generally did toward the Temple. But
they were no idolaters; for they observed the law of Moses with scrupulous fidelity. They held all things in common, and despised riches, their wants being supplied by the administration of Curators or
Stewards. The Tetractys, composed of round dots instead of jods, was re vered among them. This being a Pythagorean symbol, evidently shows their connection with the school of Pythagoras; but their
peculiar tenets more resemble those of Confucius and Zoroaster; and probably were adopted while they were prisoners in Persia; which explains their turning toward the Sun in prayer.
Their demeanor was sober and chaste. They submitted to the superintendence of governors whom they
appointed over themselves. The whole of their time was spent in labor, meditation, and prayer and they were most sedulously attentive to every call of justice and humanity, and every moral duty. They
believed in the unity of God. They supposed the souls of men to have fallen, by a disastrous fate, from the regions of purity and light, into the bodies which they occupy; during their continuance in which
they considered them confined as in a prison. Therefore they did not believe in the resurrection of the body; but in that of the soul only. They believed in a future state of rewards and punishments; and they
disregarded the ceremonies or external forms enjoined in the law of Moses to be observed in the worship og God; holding that the words of that lawgiver were to be understood in a mysterious and
recondite sense, and not according to their literal meaning. They offered no sacrifices, except at home; and by meditation they endeavored, as far as possible, to isolate the soul from the body, and carry it
back to God.
Eusebius broadly admits "that the ancient Therapeutae were Christians; and that their ancient writings were our Gospels and Epistles."
The ESSENES were of the Eclectic Sect of Philosophers, and held PLATo in the highest esteem; they

204/641
believed that true philosophy, the greatest and most salutary gift of God to mortals, was scattered, in various portions, through all the different Sects; and that it was, consequently, the duty of every wise
man to gather it from the several quarters where it lay dispersed, and to employ it, thus reunited, in destroying the dominion of impiety and vice.
The great festivals of the Solstices were observed in a distinguished manner by the Essenes; as would
naturally be supposed, from the fact that they reverenced the Sun, not as a god, but as a symbol of light and fire; the fountain of which, the Orientals supposed God to be. They lived in continence and
abstinence, and had establislments similar to the monasteries of the early Christians.
The writings of the Essenes were full of mysticism, parables, enigmas, and allegories. They believed in the esoteric and exoteric meanings of the Scriptures; and, as we have already said, they had a warrant
for that in the Scriptures themselves. They found it in the Old Testament, as the Gnostics found it in the New. The Christian writers, and even Christ himself, recognized it as a truth, that all Scripture had an
inner and an outer meaning. Thus we find it said as follows, in one of the Gospels:
"Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but unto men that are without, all these things are done in parables; that seeing, they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear
and not understand. And the disciples came and said unto him, 'Why speakest Thou the truth in parables?' He answered and said unto them, 'Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the
Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.'"
Paul, in the 4th chapter of his Epistle to the Galatians, speaking of the simplest facts of the Old Testament, asserts that they are an allegory. In the 3d chapter of the second letter to the Corinthians, he
declares himself a minister of the New Testament, appointed by God; "Not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter killeth." Origen and St. Gregory held that the Gospels were not to be taken in their literal
sense; and Athanasius admonishes us that "Should we understand sacred writ according to the letter, we should fall into the most enormous blasphemies."
Eusebius said, "Those who preside over the Holy Scriptures, philosophize over them, and expound their
literal sense by allegory."
The sources of our knowledge of the Kabalistic doctrines, are the books of Jezirah and Sohar, the former drawn up in the second century, and the latter a little later; but containing materials much older
than themselves. In their most characteristic elements, they go back to the time of the exile. In them, as in the teachings of Zoroaster, everything that exists emanated from a source of infinite LiGHT.
Before everything, existed THE AN CIENT OF DAYS, the KING OF LIGHT; a title often given to the Creator in the ZendAvesta and the code of the Sabaeans. With the idea so expressed is connected the

pantheism of India. KING OF LIGHT, THE ANCIENT, is ALL THAT IS. He is not only the real cause of all Existences; he is Infinite (AINSOPH). He is HIMSELF: there is nothing in Him that We
can call Thou.
In the Indian doctrine, not only is the Supreme Being the real cause of all, but he is the only real Existence: all the rest is illusion. In the Kabalah, as in the Persian and Gnostic doctrines, He is the
Supreme Being unknown to all, the "Unknown Father." The world is his revelation, and subsists only in Him. His attri butes are reproduced there, with different modifications, and in different degrees, so that
the Universe is His Holy Splendor:it is but His Mantle; but it must be revered in silence. All beings have emanated from the Supreme Being: The nearer a being is to Him, the more perfect it is; the more
remote in the scale, the less its purity.
A ray of Light, shot from the Deity, is the cause and principle of all that exists. It is at once Father and Mother of All, in the sublimest sense. It penetrates everything; and without it nothing can exist an
instant. From this double FORCE, designated by the two parts of the word I.�. H.�. U.�. H.�. emanated the FIRSTBORN of God, the Universal Form, in which are contained all beings; the Persian
and Platonic Archetype of things, united with the Infinite by the primitive ray of Light.
This FirstBorn is the Creative Agent, Conservator, and animating Principle of the Universe. It is THE LIGHT OF LIGHT. It possesses the three Primitive Forces of the Divinity, LIGHT, SPIRIT and LIFE.
As it has received what it gives, Light and Life, it is equally considered as the generative and conceptive Principle, the Primitive Man, ADAM KADMON. As such, it has revealed itself in ten emanations or
Sephiroth, which are not ten different beings, nor even beings at all; but sources of life, vessels of Omnipotence, and types of Creation. They are Sovereignty or Will, Wisdom, Intelligence, Benignity,
Severity, Beauty, Victory, Glory, Permanency, and Empire. These are attributes of God; and this idea, that God re veals Himself by His attributes, and that the human mind cannot perceive or discern God
Himself, in his works, but only his mode of manifesting Himself, is a profound Truth. We know of the Invisible only what the Visible reveals.
Wisdom was called NOUS and LOGOS, lNTELLECT or the WORD. Intelligence, source of the oil of
anointing, responds to the Holy Ghost of the Christian Faith.
Beauty is represented by green and yellow. Victory is YAHOVAHTSABAOTH, the column on the right hand, the column Jachin: Glory is the column Boaz, on the left hand. And thus our symbols
appear again in the Kabalah. And again the LIGHT, the object of our labors, appears as the creative power of Deity. The circle, also, was the special symbol of the first Sephirah, Kether, or the Crown.
We do not further follow the Kabalah in its four Worlds of Spirits, Aziluth, Briah, Yezirah, and Asiah,

or of emanation, creation, formation, and fabrication, one inferior to and one emerging from the other, the superior always enveloping the inferior; its doctrine that, in all that exists, there is nothing purely
material; that all comes from God, and in all He proceeds by irradiation; that everything subsists by the Divine ray that penetrates creation; and all is united by the Spirit of God, which is the life of life; so
that all is God; the Existences that inhabit the four worlds, inferior to each other in proportion to their distance from the Great King of Light: the contest between the good and evil Angels and Principles, to
endure until the Eternal Himself comes to end it and reestablish the primitive harmony; the four distinct parts of the Soul of Man; and the migrations of impure souls, until they are sufficiently purified
to share with the Spirits of Light the contemplation of the Supreme Being whose Splendor fills the Universe.
The WORD was also found in the Phoenician Creed. As in all those of Asia, a WORD of God, written
in starry characters, by the planetary Divinities, and communicated by the DemiGods, as a profound mystery, to the higher classes of the human race, to be communicated by them to mankind, created the
world. The faith of the Phoenicians was an emanation from that ancient worship of the Stars, which in the creed of Zoroaster alone, is connected with a faith in one God. Light and Fire are the most
important agents in the Phoenician faith. There is a race of children of the Light. They adored the Heaven with its Lights, deeming it the Supreme God.
Everything emanates from a Single Principle, and a Primitive Love, which is the Moving Power of All
and governs all. Light, by its union with Spirit, whereof it is but the vehicle or symbol, is the Life of everything, and penetrates everything. It should therefore be respected and honored everywhere; for
everywhere it governs and controls.
The Chaldaic and Jerusalem Paraphrasts endeavored to render the phrase, DEBARYAHOVAH, the Word of God, a personalty, wherever they met with it. The phrase, "And God created man," is, in the
Jerusalem Targum, "And the Word of IHUH created man."
So, in xxviii. Gen. 20,21, where Jacob says: "If God (IHIH ALHIM) will be with me...then shall IHUH be my ALHIM; UHIH IHUH LI LALHIM; and this stone shall be God's House (IHIH BITH ALHIM):
Onkelos paraphrases it, "If the word of IHUH will be my help. . . . then the word of IHUH shall be my God."
So, in iii. Gen. 8, for "The Voice of the Lord God" (IHUH ALHIM), we have, "The Voice of the Word
of IHUH." In ix. Wisdom, 1, "O God of my Fathers and Lord of Mercy! who has made all things with thy word." And in xviii. Wisdom, 15, "Thine Almighty Word leaped down from Heaven."
Philo speaks of the Word as being the same with God. So in several places he calls it the Second

Divinity; the Image of God: the Divine Word that made all things: substitute, of God; and the like.
Thus when John commenced to preach, had been for ages agitated, by the Priests and Philosophers of the East and West, the great questions concerning the eternity or creation of matter: immediate or
intermediate creation of the Universe by the Supreme God; the origin, object, and final extinction of evil; the relations between the intellectual and material worlds, and between God and man; and the
creation, fall, redemption, and restoration to his first estate, of man.
The Jewish doctrine, differing in this from all the other Oriental creeds, and even from the Alohayistic legend with which the book of Genesis commences, attributed the creation to the immediate action of
the Supreme Being. The Theosophists of the other Eastern Peoples interposed more than one intermediary between God and the world. To place between them but a single Being, to suppose for the
production of the world but a single intermediary, was, in their eyes, to lower the Supreme Majesty. The interval between God, who is perfect Purity, and matter, which is base and foul, was too great for
them to clear it at a single step. Even in the Occident, neither Plato nor Philo could thus impoverish the Intellectual World.
Thus, Cerinthus of Ephesus, with most of the Gnostics, Philo, the Kabalah, the ZendAvesta, the
Puranas, and all the Orient, deemed the distance and antipathy between the Supreme Being and the material world too great, to attribute to the former the creation of the latter. Below, and emanating
from, or created by, the Ancient of Days, the Central Light, the Beginning, or First Principle, one, two, or more Principles, Existences, or Intellectual Beings were imagined, to some one or more of whom
(without any immediate creative act on the part of the Great Immovable, Silent Deity), the immediate creation of the material and mental universe was due.
We have already spoken of many of the speculations on this point. To some, the world was created by
the LOGOS or WORD, first manifestation of, or emanation from, the Deity. To others, the beginning of creation was by the emanation of a ray of Light, creating the principle of Light and Life. The
Primitive THOUGHT, creating the inferior Deities, a succession of INTELLGENCES, the Iynges of Zoroaster, his Amshaspands, Izeds, and Ferouers, the Ideas of Plato, the Aions of the Gnostics, the
Angels of the Jews, the Nous, the Demiourgos, the DIVINE REASON, the Powers or Forces of Philo, and the Alohayim, Forces or Superior Gods of the ancient legend with which Genesis begins, to these
and other intermediaries the creation was owing. No restraints were laid on the Fancy and the Imagination. The veriest Abstractions became Existences and Realities. The attributes of God,
personified, became Powers, Spirits, Intelligences.
God was the Light of Light, Divine Fire, the Abstract Intellectuality, the Root or Germ of the Universe. Simon Magus, founder of the Gnostic faith, and many of the early Judaizing Christians, admitted that

the manifestations of the Supreme Being, as FATHER, or JEhOVAh, SON or CHRIST, and HOLY SPIRIT, were only so many different modes of Existence, or Forces of the same God. To others they
were, as were the multitude of Subordinate Intelligences, real and distinct beings.
The Oriental imagination revelled in the creation of these Inferior Intelligences, Powers of Good and Evil, and Angels. We have spoken of those imagined by the Persians and the Kabalists. In the Talmud,
every star, every country, every town, and almost every tongue has a Prince of Heaven as its Protector. JEHUEL, is the guardian of fire, and MICHAEL of water. Seven spirits assist each; those of fire being
Seraphiel, Gabriel, Nitriel, Tammael, Tchimschiel, Hadarniel, and Sarniel. These seven are represented by the square columns of this Degree, while the columns JACHIN and BOAZ represent the angels of
fire and water. But the col umns are not representatives of these alone.
To Basilides, God was without name, uncreated, at first containing and concealing in Himself the Plenitude of His Perfections and when these are by Him displayed and nianifested, there result as many
particular Existences, all analogous to Him, and still and always Him. To the Essenes and the Gnostics, the East and the West both devised this faith; that the Ideas, Conceptions, or Manifestations of the
Deity were so many Creations, so many Beings, all God, nothing without Him, but more than what we now understand by the word ideas. They emanated from and were again merged in God. They had a
kind of middle existence between our modern ideas, and the intelligences or ideas, elevated to the rank of genii, of the Oriental mythology.
These personified attributes of Deity, in the theory of Basilides, were the Firstborn, Nous or Mind:
from it emanates Logos, or THE WORD from it: Phronesis, Intellect: from it Sophia, Wisdom: from it Dunamis, Power: and from it Dikaiosune, Righteousness: to which latter the Jews gave the name of
Eirene, Peace, or Calm, the essential characteristics of Divinity, and harmonious effect of all His perfections. The whole number of successive emanations was 365, expressed by the Gnostics, in Greek
letters, by the mystic word Abraxas; designating God as manifested, or the aggregate of his manifestations; but not the Supreme and Secret God Himself. These three hundred and sixtyfive
Intelligences compose altogether the Fullness or Plenitude of the Divine Emanations.
With the Ophites, a sect of the Gnostics, there were seven inferior spirits (inferior to Ialdabaoth, the Demiourgos or Actual Creator: Michael, Suriel, Raphael, Gabriel, Thauthabaoth, Erataoth, and
Athaniel, the genii of the stars called the Bull; the Dog, the Lion, the Bear, the Serpent, the Eagle, and the Ass that formerly figured in the constellation Cancer, and symbolized respectively by those animals;
as Ialdabaoth, Iao, Adonai, Eloi, Orai, and As taphai were the genii of Saturn, the Moon, the Sun, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury.
The WORD appears in all these creeds. It is the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the

Nous of Platonism and Philonism, and the Sophia or Demiourgos of the Gnostics.
And all these creeds, while admitting these different manifestations of the Supreme Being, held that His identity was immutable and permanent. That was Plato's distinction between the Being always the same
and the perpetual flow of things incessantly changing, the Genesis.
The belief in dualism in some shape, was universal. Those who held that everything emanated from God, aspired to God, and reentered into God, believed that, among those emanations were two adverse
Principles, of Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. This prevailed in Central Asia and in Syria; while in Egypt it assumed the form of Greek speculation. In the former, a second Intellectual Principle was
admitted, active in its Empire of Darkness, audacious against the Empire of Light. So the Persians and Sabeans understood it. In Egypt, this second Principle was Matter, as the word was used by the Platonic
School, with its sad attributes, Vacuity, Darkness, and Death. In their theory, matter could be animated only by the low communication of a principle of divine life. It resists the influences that would
spiritualize it. That resisting Power is Satan, the rebellious Matter, Matter that does not partake of God.
To many there were two Principles; the Unknown Father, or Supreme and Eternal God, living in the centre of the Light, happy in the perfect purity of His being; the other, eternal Matter, that inert,
shapeless, darksome mass, which they considered as the source of all evils, the mother and dwelling place of Satan.
To Philo and the Platonists, there was a Soul of the world, creating visible things, and active in them, as
agent of the Supreme Intelligence; realizing therein the ideas communicated to Him by that Intelligence, and which sometimes excel His conceptions, but which He executes without
comprehending them.
The Apocalypse or Revelations, by whomever written, belongs to the Orient and to extreme antiquity. It reproduces what is far older than itself. It paints, with the strongest colors that the Oriental genius
ever employed, the closing scenes of the great struggle of Light, and Truth, and Good, against Darkness, Error, and Evil; personified in that between the New Religion on one side, and Paganism and
Judaism on the other. It is a particular application of the ancient myth of Ormuzd and his Genii against Ahri man and his Devs; and it celebrates the final triumph of Truth against the combined powers of
men and demons. The ideas and imagery are borrowed from every quarter; and allusions are found in it to the doctrines of all ages. We are continually reminded of the ZendAvesta, the Jewish Codes, Philo,
and the Gnosis. The Seven Spirits surrounding the Throne of the Eternal, at the opening of the Grand Drama, and acting so important a part throughout, everywhere the first instruments of the Divine Will
and Vengence, are the Seven Amshaspands of Parsism; as the Twentyfour Ancients, offering to the Supreme Being the first supplications and the first homage, remind us of the Mysterious Chiefs of

Judaism, foreshadow the Eons of Gnosticism, and reproduce the twentyfour Good Spirits created by Ormuzd and inclosed in an egg.
The Christ of the Apocalypse, Firstborn of Creation and of the Resurrection is invested with the
characteristics of the Ormuzd and Sosiosch of the ZendAvesta, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah and the Carpistes of the Gnostics. The idea that the true Initiates and Faithful become Kings and Priests, is at
once Persian, Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic. And the definition of the Supreme Being, that He is at once Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end He that was, and is, and is to come, i.e., Time
illimitable, is Zoroaster's definition of ZerouaneAk herene.
The depths of Satan which no man can measure; his triumph for a time by fraud and violence; his being chained by an angel; his reprobation and his precipitation into a sea of metal; his names of the Serpent
and the Dragon; the whole conflict of the Good Spirits or celestial armies against the bad; are so many ideas and designations found alike in the ZendAvesta, the Kabalah, and the Gnosis.
We even find in the Apocalypse that singular Persian idea, which regards some of the lower animals as
so many Devs or vehicles of Devs.
The guardianship of the earth by a good angel, the renewing of the earth and heavens, and the final triumph of pure and holy men, are the same victory of Good over Evil, for which the whole Orient
looked.
The gold, and white raiments of the twentyfour Elders are, as in the Persian faith, the signs of a lofty perfection and divine purity.
Thus the Human mind labored and struggled and tortured itself for ages, to explain to itself what it felt,
without confessing it, to be inexplicable. A vast crowd of indistinct abstractions, hovering in the imagination, a train of words embodying no tangible meaning, an inextricable labyrinth of subtleties,
was the result.
But one grand idea ever emerged and stood prominent and unchangeable over the weltering chaos of confusion. God is great, and good, and wise. Evil and pain and sorrow are temporary, and for wise and
beneficent purposes. They must be consistent with God's goodness, purity, and infinite perfection; and there must be a mode of explaining them, if we could but find it out; as, in all ways we will endeavor to
do. Ultimately, Good will prevail, and Evil be overthrown. God, alone can do this, and He will do it, by an Emanation from Himself, assuming the Human form and redeeming the world.

Behold the object, the end, the result, of the great speculations and logomachies of antiquity; the
ultimate annihilation of evil, and restoration of Man to his first estate, by a Redeemer, a Masayah, a Christos, the incarnate Word, Reason, or Power of Deity.
This Redeemer is the Word or Logos, the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the Nous
of Platonism and Philonism; He that was in the Beginning with God, and was God, and by Whom everything was made. That He was looked for by all the People of the East is abundantly shown by the
Gospel of John and the Letters of Paul; wherein scarcely anything seemed neces sary to be said in proof that such a Redeemer was to come; but all the energies of the writers are devoted to showing that
Jesus was that Christos whom all the nations were expecting; the "Word," the Masayah, the Anointed or Consecrated One.
In this Degree the great contest between good and evil, in anticipation of the appearance and advent of
the Word or Redeemer is symbolized; and the mysterious esoteric teachings of the Essenes and the Cabalists. Of the practices of the former we gain but glimpses in the ancient writers; but we know that,
as their doc trines were taught by John the Baptist, they greatly resembled those of greater purity and more nearly perfect, taught by Jesus; and that not only Palestine was full of John's disciples, so that the
Priests and Pharisees did not dare to deny John's inspiration; but his doctrine had extended to Asia Minor, and had made converts in luxurious Ephesus, as it also had in Alexandria in Egypt; and that they
readily embraced the Christian faith, of which they had before not even heard.
These old controversies have died away, and the old faiths have faded into oblivion. But Masonry still survives, vigorous and strong, as when philosophy was taught in the schools of Alexandria and under
the Portico; teaching the same old truths as the Essenes taught by the shores of the Dead Sea, and as John the Baptist preached in the Desert; truths imperishable as the Deity, and undeniable as Light.
Those truths were gathered by the Essenes from the doctrines of the Orient and the Occident, from the ZendAvesta and the Vedas, from Plato and Pythagoras, from India, Persia, Phoenicia, and Syria, from
Greece and Egypt, and from the Holy Books of the Jews. Hence we are called Knights of the East and West, because their doctrines came from both. And these doctrines, the wheat sifted from the chaff, the
Truth seperated from Error, Masonry has garnered up in her heart of hearts, and through the fires of persecution, and the storms of calamity, has brought them and delivered them unto us. That God is
One, immutable, unchangeable, infinitely just and good; that Light will finally overcome Darkness, Good conquer Evil, and Truth be victor over Error; these, rejecting all the wild and useless speculations
of the ZendAvesta, the Kabalah, the Gnostics, and the Schools, are the religion and Philosophy of Masonry.
Those speculations and fancies it is useful to study; that knowing in what worthless and unfruitful
investigations the mind may engage, you may the more value and appreciate the plain, simple, sublime,

universallyacknowledged truths, which have in all ages been the Light by which Masons have been guided on their way; the Wisdom and Strength that like imperishable columns have sustained and will
continue to sustain its glorious and magnificent Temple.
XVIII. KNIGHT ROSE CROIX
[Prince Rose Croix]
Each of us makes such applications to his own faith and creed, of the symbols and ceremonies of this Degree, as seems to him proper. With these special interpretations we have here nothing to do. Like
the legend of the Master Khurum, in which some see figured the condemnation and sufferings of Christ; others those of the unfortunate Grand Master of the Templars; others those of the first Charles,
King of England; and others still the annual descent of the Sun at the winter Solstice to the regions of darkness, the basis of many an ancient legend; so the ceremonies of this Degree receive different
explanations; each interpreting them for himself, and being offended at the interpretation of no other.
In no other way could Masonry possess its character of Universality; that character which has ever been peculiar to it from its origin; and which enables two Kings, worshippers of different Deities, to sit
together as Masters, while the walls of the first temple arose and the men of Gebal, bowing down to the Phoenician Gods, to work by the side of the Hebrews to whom those Gods were abomination; and to sit
with them in the same Lodge as brethren.
You have already learned that these ceremonies have one general significance, to every one, of every faith, who believes in God, and the soul's immortality.
The primitive men met in no Temples made with human hands. "God," said Sthe existence of a single
uncreated God, in whose bosom everything grows, is developed and trans formed. The worship of this God reposed upon the obedience of all the beings He created. His feasts were those of the Solstices.
The doctrines of Buddha pervaded India, China, and Japan. The Priests of Brahma, professing a dark and bloody creed, brutalized by Superstition, united together against Buddhism, and with the aid of
Despotism, exterminated its followers. But their blood fertilized the new docfirst falling themselves, and plunged in misery and darkness, tempted man to his fall, and brought sin into the world. All
believed in a future life, to be attained by purification and trials; in a state or successive states of reward and punishment; and in a Mediator or Redeemer, by whom the Evil Principle was to be overcome and
the Supreme Deity reconciled to His creatures. The belief was general, that He was to be born of a Virgin, and suffer a painful death. The Indians called him Chrishna; the Chinese, Kiountse; the
Persians, Sosiosch; the Chaldeans, Dhouvanai; the Egyptians, HarOeri; Plato, Love; and the Scandinavians, Balder.

Chrishna,the Hindoo Redeemer, was cradled and educated among Shepherds. A Tyrant, at the time of
his birth, ordered all male children to be slain. He performed miracles, say his legends, even raising the dead. He washed the feet of the Brahmins, and was meek and lowly of spirit. He was born of a Virgin;
descended to Hell, rose again, ascended to Heaven, charged his disciples to teach his doctrines, and gave them the gift of miracles.
The first Masonic Legislator whose memory is preserved to us by history, was Buddha, who, about a
thousand years before the Christian era, reformed the religion of Manous. He called to the Priesthood all men, without distinction of caste, who felt themselves inspired by God to instruct men. Those who
so associated themselves formed a Society of Prophets under the name of Sa maneans. They recognized the existence of a single uncreated God, in whose bosom everything grows, is developed
and transformed. The worship of this God reposed upon the obedience of all the beings He created. His feasts were those of the Solstices. The doctrines of Buddha pervaded India, China, and Japan. The
Priests of Brahma, professing a dark and bloody creed, brutalized by Superstition, united together against Buddhism, and with the aid of Despotism, exterminated its followers. But their blood fertilized
the new doctrine, which produced a new Society under the name of Gymnosophists; and a large number, fleeing to Ireland, planted their doctrines there, and there erected the round towers, some of
which still stand, solid and unshaken as at first, visible monuments of the remotest ages.
The Phoenician Cosmogony, like all others in Asia, was the Word of God, written in astral characters, by the planetary Divinities, and communicated by the Demigods, as a profound mystery, to the
brighter intelligences of Humanity, to be propagated by them among men. Their doctrines resembled the Ancient Sabeism, and being the faith of Hiram the King and his namesake the Artist, are of interest
to all Masons. With them, the First Principle was half material, half spiritual, a dark air, animated and impregnated by the spirit; and a disordered chaos, covered with thick darkness. From this came the
Word, and thence creation and generation; and thence a race of men, children of light, who adored Heaven and its Stars as the Supreme Being; and whose different gods were but incarnations of the Sun,
the Moon, the Stars, and the Ether. Chrysor was the great igneous power of Nature, and Baal and Malakarth representations of the Sun and Moon, the latter word, in Hebrew, meaning Queen.
Man had fallen, but not by the tempting of the serpent. For, with the Phoenicians, the serpent was
deemed to partake of the Divine Nature, and was sacred, as he was in Egypt. He was deemed to be immortal, unless slain by violence, becoming young again in his old age, by entering into and
consuming himself. Hence the Serpent in a circle, holding his tail in his mouth, was an emblem of eternity. With the head of a hawk he was of a Divine Nature, and a symbol of the sun. Hence one Sect
of the Gnostics took him for their good genius, and hence the brazen serpent reared by Moses in the Desert, on which the Israelites looked and lived.

"Before the chaos, that preceded the birth of Heaven and Earth," said the Chinese LaoTseu, "a single Being existed, immense and silent, immutable and always acting; the mother of the Universe. I know
not the name of that Being, but I designate it by the word Reason. Man has his model in the earth, the earth in Heaven, Heaven in Reason, and Reason in itself."
"I am," says Isis, "Nature; parent of all things, the sovereign of the Elements, the primitive progeny of
Time, the most exalted of the Deities, the first of the Heavenly Gods and Goddesses, the Queen of the Shades, the uniform countenance; who dispose with my rod the numerous lights of Heaven, the
salubrious breezes of the sea, and the mournful silence of the dead; whose single Divinity the whole world venerates in many forms, with various rites and by many names. The Egyptians, skilled in
ancient lore, worship me with proper ceremonies, and call me by my true name, Isis the Queen."
The Hindu Vedas thus define the Deity: "He who surpasses speech, and through whose power speech is expressed, know thou that He is Brahma; and not these perishable things that man adores.
"He whom Intelligence cannot comprehend, and He alone, say the sages, through whose Power the
nature of Intelligence can be understood, know thou that He is Brahma; and not these perishable things that man adores.
"He who cannot be seen by the organ of sight and through whose power the organ of seeing sees, know
thou that He is Brahma; and not these perishable things that man adores.
"He who cannot be heard by the organ of hearing, and through whose power the organ of hearing hears, know thou that He is Brahma; and not these perishable things that man adores.
"He who cannot be perceived by the organ of smelling, and through whose power the organ of smelling
smells, know thou that He is Brahma; and not these perishable things that man adores."
"When God resolved to create the human race," said Arius, "He made a Being that He called The WORD, The Son, Wisdom, to the end that this Being might give existence to men." This WORD is the
Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the Nous of Plato and Philo, the Wisdom or Demiourgos of the Gnostics.
That is the True Word, the knowledge of which our ancient brethren sought as the priceless reward of
their labors on the Holy Temple: the Word of Life, the Divine Reason, "in whom was Life, and that Life the Light of men";"which long shone in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not;" the Infinite

Reason that is the Soul of Nature, immortal, of which the Word of this Degree reminds us; and to believe wherein and revere it, is the peculiar duty of every Mason.
"In the beginning," says the extract from some older work, with which John commences his Gospel,
"was the Word, and the Word was near to God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was Life, and the life was the Light of
man; and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not contain it."
It is an old tradition that this passage was from an older work. And Philostorgius and Nicephorus state, that when the Emperor Julian undertook to rebuild the Temple, a stone was taken up, that covered the
mouth of a deep square cave, into which one of the laborers, being let down by a rope, found in the centre of the floor a cubical pillar, on which lay a roll or book, wrapped in a fine linen cloth, in which,
in capital letters, was the foregoing passage.
However this may have been, it is plain that John's Gospel is a polemic against the Gnostics; and, stating at the outset the current doctrine in regard to the creation by the Word, he then addresses himself
to show and urge that this Word was Jesus Christ.
And the first sentence, fully rendered into our language, would read thus:"When the process of emanation, of creation or evolution of existences inferior to the Supreme God began, the Word came
into existence and was: and this word was near to God; i.e. the immediate or first emanation from God: and it was God Himself, developed or manifested in that particular mode, and in action. And by that
Word everything that is was created."And thus Tertullian says that God made the World out of nothing, by means of His Word, Wisdom, or Power.
To Philo the Jew, as to the Gnostics, the Supreme Being was the Primitive Light, or Archetype of Light
Source whence the rays emanate that illuminate Souls. He is the Soul of the World, and as such acts everywhere. He himself fills and bounds his whole existence, and his forces fill and penetrate
everything. His Image is the WORD [LOGOS], a form more brilliant than fire, which is not pure light. This WORD dwells in God; for it is within His Intelligence that the Supreme Being frames for Himself
the Types of Ideas of all that is to assume reality in the Universe. The WORD is the Vehicle by which God acts on the Universe; the World of Ideas by means whereof God has created visible things; the
more Ancient God, as compared with the Material World; Chief and General Representative of all Intelligences; the Archangel and representative of all spirits, even those of Mortals; the type of Man;
the primitive man himself. These ideas are borrowed from Plato. And this Word is not only the Creator ["by Him was everything made that was made"], but acts in the place of God and through him act all
the Powers and Attributes of God. And also, as first representative of the human race, he is the protector of Men and their Shepherd, the "Ben H'Adam," or Son of Man.

The actual condition of Man is not his primitive condition, that in which he was the image of the Word.
His unruly passions have caused him to fall from his original lofty estate. But he may rise again, by following the teachings of Heavenly Wisdom, and the Angels whom God commissions to aid him in
escaping from the entanglements of the body; and by fighting bravely against Evil, the existence of which God has allowed solely to furnish him with the means of exercising his free will.
The Supreme Being of the Egyptians was Amun, a secret and concealed God, the Unknown Father of
the Gnostics, the Source of Divine Life, and of all force, the Plenitude of all, comprehending all things in Himself, the original Light. He creates nothing; but everything emanates from Him: and all other
Gods are but his manifestations. From Him, by the utterance of a Word, emanated Neith, the Divine Mother of all things, the Primitive THOUGHT, the FORCE that puts everything in movement, the
SPIRIT everywhere extended, the Deity of Light and Mother of the Sun.
Of this Supreme Being, Osiris was the image, Source of all Good in the moral and physical world, and constant foe of Typhon, the Genius of Evil, the Satan of Gnosticism, brute mat ter, deemed to be
always at feud with the spirit that flowed from the Deity; and over whom HarOeri, the Redeemer, Son of Isis and Osiris, is finally to prevail.
In the ZendAvesta of the Persians the Supreme Being is Time without limit, ZERUANE AKHERENE.
No origin could be assigned to Him; for He was enveloped in His own Glory, and His Nature and Attributes were so inaccessible to human Intelli gence, that He was but the object of a silent
veneration. The commencement of Creation was by emanation from him. The first emanation was the Primitive Light, and from this Light emerged Ormuzd, the King of Light, who, by the WORD, created
the World in its purity, is its Preserver and Judge, a Holy and Sacred Being, Intelligence and Knowledge, Himself Time without limit, and wielding all the powers of the Supreme Being.
In this Persian faith, as taught many centuries before our era, and embodied in the ZendAvesta, there
was in man a pure Principle, proceeding from the Supreme Being, produced by the Will and Word of Ormuzd. To that was united an impure principle, proceeding from a foreign influence, that of Ahriman,
the Dragon, or principle of Evil. Tempted by Ahriman, the first man and woman had fallen; and for twelve thousand years there was to be war between Ormuzd and the Good Spirits created by him, and
Ahrirnan and the Evil ones whom he had called into existence.
But pure souls are assisted by the Good Spirits, the Triumph of the Good Principle is determined upon in the decrees of the Supreme Being, and the period of that triumph will infallibly arrive. At the
moment when the earth shall be most afflicted with the evils brought upon it by the Spirits of perdition, three Prophets will appear to bring assistance to mortals. Sosiosch, Chief of the Three, will regenerate

the world, and restore to it its primitive Beauty, Strength, and Purity. He will judge the good and the wicked. After the universal resurrection of the Good, the pure Spirits will conduct them to an abode of
eternal happiness. Ahri man, his evil Demons, and all the world, will be purified in a torrent of liquid burning metal. The Law of Ormuzd will rule everywhere: all men will be happy: all, enjoying an
unalterable bliss, will unite with Sosiosch in singing the praises of the Supreme Being.
These doctrines, with some modifications, were adopted by the Kabalists and afterward by the Gnostics.
Apollonius of Tyana says:"We shall render the most appropriate worship to the Deity, when to that God
whom we call the First, who is One, and separate from all, and after whom we recog nize the others, we present no offerings whatever, kindle to Him no fire, dedicate to Him no sensible thing; for he needs
nothing, even of all that natures more exalted than ours could give. The earth produces no plant, the air nourishes no animal, there is in short nothing, which would not be impure in his sight. In addressing
ourselves to Him, we must use only the higher word, that, I mean, which is not expressed by the mouth, the silent inner word of the spirit. From the most Glorious of all Beings, we must seek for blessings, by
that which is most glorious in ourselves; and that is the spirit, which needs no organ."
Strabo says: "This one Supreme Essence is that which embraces us all, the water and the land, that which we call the Heavens, the World, the Nature of things. This Highest Being should be worshipped,
without any visible image, in sacred groves. In such retreats the devout should lay themselves down to sleep, and expect signs from God in dreams."
Aristolte says: "It has been handed down in a mythical form, from the earliest times to posterity, that
there are Gods, and that The Divine compasses entire nature. All besides this has been added, after the mythical style, for the purpose of persuading the multitude, and for the interest of the laws and the
advantage of the State. Thus men have given to the Gods human forms, and have even represented them under the figure of other beings, in the train of which fictions followed many more of the same sort.
But if, from all this, we separate the original principle, and consider it alone, namely, that the first Essences are Gods, we shall find that this has been divinely said; and since it is probable that
philosophy and the arts have been several times, so far as that is possible, found and lost, such doctrines may have been preserved to our times as the remains of ancient wisdom."
Porphyry says: "By images addressed to sense, the ancients represented God and his powers by the
visible they typified the invisible for those who had learned to read, in these types, as in a book, a treatise on the Gods. We need not wonder if the ignorant consider the images to be nothing more than
wood or stone; for just so, they who are ignorant of writing see nothing in monuments but stone, nothing in tablets but wood, and in books but a tissue of papyrus."

Apollonius of Tyana held, that birth and death are only in appearance; that which separates itself from
the one substance (the one Divine essence), and is caught up by matter, seems to be born; that, again, which releases itself from the bonds of matter, and is reunited with the one Divine Essence, seems to
die. There is, at most, an alteration between becoming visible and becoming in visible. In all there is, properly speaking, but the one essence, which alone acts and suffers, by becoming all things to all; the
Eternal God, whom men wrong, when they deprive Him of what properly can be attributed to Him only, and transfer it to other names and persons.
The New Platonists substituted the idea of the Absolute, for the Supreme Essence itself; as the first,
simplest principle, anterior to all existence; of which nothing determinate can be predicated; to which no consciousness, no selfcontemplation can be ascribed; inasmuch as to
do so, would immediately imply a quality, a distinction of subject and object. This Supreme Entity can be known only by an intellectual intuition of the Spirit, transcending itself, and emancipating itself
from its own limits.
This mere logical tendency, by means of which men thought to arrive at the conception of such an absolute, the ov, was united with a certain mysticism, which, by a transcendent state of feeling,
communicated, as it were, to this abstraction what the mind would receive as a reality. The absorption of the Spirit into that superexistence, so as to be entirely identified with it, or such a revelation of the
latter to the spirit raised above itself, was regarded as the highest end which the spiritual life could reach.
The New Platonists' idea of God, was that of One Simple Original Essence, exalted akes a distinction
between those who are in the proper sense Sons of God, having by means of contemplation raised themselves to the highest Being, or attained to a knowledge of Him, in His immediate self
manifestation, and those who know God only in his mediate revelation through his operation such as He declares Himself in creation in the revelation still veiled in the letter of Scripture those, in short, who
attach themselves simply to the Logos, and consider this to be the Supreme God; who aren; and after it has rid itself from all that pertains to sense from all manifoldness. They are the mediators between man
(amazed and stupefied by manifold ness) and the Supreme Unity.
Philo says:"He who disbelieves the miraculous, simply as the miraculous, neither knows God, nor has he ever sought after Him; for otherwise he would have understood, by looking at that truly great and
aweinspiring sight, the miracle of the Universe, that these miracles (in God's providential guidance of His people) are but child's play for the Divine Power. But the truly miraculous has become despised
through familiarity. The universal, on the contrary, although in itself insignificant, yet, through our love of novelty, transports us with amazement."

In opposition to the anthropopathism of the Jewish Scriptures, the Alexandrian Jews endeavored to
purify the idea of God from all admixture of the Human. By the exclusion of every human passion, it was sublimated to a something devoid of all attributes, and wholly transcendental; and the mere Being,
the Good, in and by itself, the Absolute of Platonism, was substituted for the personal Deity of the Old Testament. By soaring upward, beyond all created existence, the mind, disengaging itself from the
Sensible, attains to the intellectual intuition of this Absolute Being; of whom, however, it can predicate nothing but existence, and sets aside all other determinations as not answering to the exalted nature of
the Supreme Essence.
Thus Philo makes a distinction between those who are in the proper sense Sons of God, having by means of contemplation raised themselves to the highest Being, or attained to a knowledge of Him, in
His immediate selfmanifestation, and those who know God only in his mediate revelation through his operation such as He declares Himself in creation in the revelation still veiled in the letter of Scripture
those, in short, who attach themselves simply to the Logos, and consider this to be the Supreme God; who are the sons of the Logos, rather than of the True Being.
"God," says Pythagoras, "is neither the object of sense, nor subject to passion, but invisible, only
intelligible, and supremely intelligent. In His body He is like the light, and in His soul He resembles truth. He is the universal spirit that pervades and diffuseth itself over all nature. All beings receive
their life from Him. There is but one only God, who is not, as some are apt to imagine, seated above the world, beyond the orb of the Universe; but being Himself all in all, He sees all the beings that fill His
immensity; the only Principle, the Light of Heaven, the Father of all. He produces everything; He orders and disposes everything; He is the REASON, the LIFE, and the MOTION of all being."
"I am the LIGHT of the world;he that followeth Me shall not walk in DARKNESS, but shall have the
LIGHT of LIFE." So said the Founder of the Christian Religion, as His words are reported by John the Apostle.
God, say the sacred writings of the Jews, appeared to Moses in a FLAME OF FIRE, in the midst of a
bush, which was not consumed. He descended upon Mount Sinai, as the smoke of a furnace; He went before the children of Israel, by day, in a pillar of cloud, and, by night, in a pillar of fire, to give them
light. "Call you on the name of your Gods," said Elijah the Prophet to the Priests of Baal, "and I will call upon the name of ADONAI; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God."
According to the Kabalah, as according to the doctrines of Zoroaster, everything that exists has
emanated from a source of infinite light. Before all things, existed the Primitive Being, THE ANCIENT OF DAYS, the Ancient King of Light; a title the more remarkable, because it is frequently

given to the Creator in the ZendAvesta, and in the Code of the Sabeans, and occurs in the Jewish Scriptures.
The world was His Revelation, God revealed and subsisted only in Him. His attributes were there
reproduced with various modifications and in different degrees; so that the Universe was His Holy Splendor, His Mantle. He was to be adored in silence and perfection consisted in a nearer approach to
Him.
Before the creation of worlds, the PRIMITIVE LIGHT filled all space, so that there was no void. When the Supreme Being, existing in this Light, resolved to display His perfections, or manifest them
in worlds, He withdrew within Himself, formed around Him a void space, and shot forth His first emanation, a ray of light; the cause and principle of everything that exists, uniting both the generative
and conceptive power, which penetrates every thing, and without which nothing could subsist for an instant.
Man fell, seduced by the Evil Spirits most remote from the Great King of Light; those of the fourth
world of spirits, Asiah, whose chief was Belial. They wage incessant war against the pure Intelligences of the other worlds, who, like the Amshaspands, Izeds, and Ferouers of the Persians are the tutelary
guardians of man. In the beginning, all was unison and harmony; full of the same divine light and perfect purity. The Seven Kings of Evil fell, and the Universe was troubled. Then the Creator took from
the Seven Kings the principles of Good and of Light, and divided them among the four worlds of Spirits, giving to the first three the Pure Intelligences, united in love and harmony, while to the fourth
were vouchsafed only some feeble glimmerings of light.
When the strife between these and the good angels shall have continued the appointed time, and these Spirits enveloped in darkness shall long and in vain have endeavored to absorb the Divine light and life,
then will the Eternal Himself come to correct them. He will deliver them from the gross envelopes of matter that hold them captive, will reanimate and strengthen the ray of light or spiritual nature which
they have preserved, and reestablish throughout the Universe that primitive Harmony which was its bliss.
Marcion, the Gnostic, said, "The Soul of the True Christian, adopted as a child by the Supreme Being,
to whom it has long been a stranger, receives from Him the Spirit and Divine life. It is led and confirmed, by this gift, in a pure and holy life, like that of God; and if it so completes its earthly career,
in charity, chastity, and sanctity, it will one day be disengaged from its material envelope, as the ripe grain is detached from the straw, and as the young bird escapes from its shell. Like the angels, it will
share in the bliss of the Good and Perfect Father, reclothed in an aerial body or organ, and made like unto the Angels in Heaven."

You see, my brother, what is the meaning of Masonic "Light." You see why the EAST of the Lodge,
where the initial letter of the Name of the Deity overhangs the Master, is the place of Light. Light, as contradistinguished from darkness, is Good, as contradistinguished from Evil: and it is that Light, the
true knowledge of Deity, the Eternal Good, for which Masons in all ages have sought. Still Masonry marches steadily onward toward that Light that shines in the great distance, the Light of that day when
Evil, overcome and vanquished, shall fade away and disappear forever, and Life and Light be the one law of the Universe, and its eternal Harmony.
The Degree of Rose Croix teaches three things; the unity, immutability and goodness of God; the
immortality of the Soul; and the ultimate defeat and extinction of evil and wrong and sorrow, by a Redeemer or Messiah, yet to come, if he has not already appeared.
It replaces the three pillars of the old Temple, with three that have already been explained to you, Faith
[in God, mankind, and man's self], Hope [in the victory over evil, the advancement of Humanity, and a hereafter], and Charity [relieving the wants, and tolerant of the errors and faults of others]. To be
trustful, to be hopeful, to be indulgent; these, in an age of selfishness, of ill opinion of human nature, of harsh and bitter judgment, are the most important Masonic Virtues, and the true supports of every
Masonic Temple. And they are the old pillars of the Temple under different names. For he only is wise who judges others charitably; he only is strong who is hopeful; and there is no beauty like a firm faith
in God, our fellows and ourself.
The second apartment, clothed in mourning, the columns of the Temple shattered and prostrate, and the brethren bowed down in the deepest dejection, represents the world under the tyranny of the Principle
of Evil; where virtue is persecuted and vice rewarded; where the righteous starve for bread, and the wicked live sumptuously and dress in purple and fine linen; where insolent ignorance rules, and
learning and genius serve; where King and Priest trample on liberty and the rights of conscience; where freedom hides in caves and mountains, and sycophancy and servility fawn and thrive; where the cry of
the widow and the orphan starving for want of food, and shivering with cold, rises ever to Heaven, from a million miserable hovels; where men, willing to labor, and starving, they and their children and the
wives of their bosoms, beg plaintively for work, when the pampered capitalist stops his mills; where the law punishes her who, starving, steals a loaf, and lets the seducer go free; where the success of a party
justifies murder, and violence and rapine go unpunished; and where he who with many years' cheating and grinding the faces of the poor grows rich, receives office and honor in life, and after death brave
funeral and a splendid mausoleum: this world, where, since its making, war has never ceased, nor man paused in the sad task of torturing and murdering his brother; and of which ambition, avarice, envy,
hatred, lust, and the rest of Ahriman's and Typhon's army make a Pandemonium: this world, sunk in sin, reeking with baseness, clamorous with sorrow and misery. If any see in it also a type of the sorrow of
the Craft for the death of Hiram, the grief of the Jews at the fall of Jerusalem, the misery of the Templars at the ruin of their order and the death of De Molay, or the world's agony and pangs of woe at

the death of the Redeemer, it is the right of each to do so.
The third apartment represents the consequences of sin and vice, and the hell made of the human heart, by its fiery passions. If any see in it also a type of the Hades of the Greeks, the Gehenna of the
Hebrews, the Tartarus of the Romans, or the Hell of the Christians, or only of the agonies of remorse and the tortures of an upbraiding conscience, it is the right of each to do so.
The fourth apartment represents the Universe, freed from the insolent dominion and tyranny of the
Principle of Evil, and brilliant with the true Light that flows from the Supreme Deity; when sin and wrong, and pain and sorrow, remorse and misery shall be no more forever; when the great plans of
Infinite Eternal Wisdom shall be fully developed; and all God's creatures, seeing that all apparent evil and individual suffering and wrong were but the drops that went to swell the great river of infinite
goodness, shall know that vast as is the power of Deity, His goodness and beneficence are infinite as His power. If any see in it a type of the peculiar mysteries of any faith or creed, or an allusion to any
past occurrences, it is their right to do so. Let each apply its symbols as he pleases. To all of us they typify the universal rule of Masonry, of its three chief virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity; of brotherly
love and universal benevolence. We labor here to no other end. These symbols need no other interpretation.
The obligations of our Ancient Brethren of the Rose Croix were to fulfill all the duties of friendship,
cheerfulness, charity, peace, liberality, temperance and chastity and scrupulously to avoid impurity, haughtiness, hatred, anger, and every other kind of vice. They took their philosophy from the old
Theology of the Egyptians, as Moses and Solomon had done, and borrowed its hieroglyphics and the ciphers of the Hebrews. Their principal rules were to exercise the profession of medicine charitably
and without fee, to advance the cause of virtue, enlarge the sciences, and induce men to live as in the primitive times of the world.
When this Degree had its origin, it is not important to inquire; nor with what different rites it has been
practised in different countries and at various times. It is of very high antiquity. Its ceremonies differ with the degrees of latitude and longitude, and it receives variant interpretations. If we were to examine
all the different ceremonials, their emblems, and their formulas, we should see that all that belongs to the primitive and essential elements of the order, is respected in every sanctuary. All alike practise
virtue, that it may produce fruit. All labor, like us, for the extirpation of vice, the purification of man, the development of the arts and sciences, and the relief of humanity.
None admit an adept to their lofty philosophical knowledge, and mysterious sciences, until he has been
purified at the altar of the symbolic Degrees. Of what importance are differences of opinion as to the age and genealogy of the Degree, or variance in the practice, ceremonial and liturgy, or the shade of

color of the banner under which each tribe of Israel marched, if all revere 'the Holy Arch of the symbolic Degrees, first and unalterable source of Free Masonry; if all revere our conservative
principles, and are with us in the great purposes of our organization?
If, anywhere, brethren of a particular religious belief have been excluded from this Degree, it merely shows how gravely the purposes and plan of Masonry may be misunderstood. For whenever the door of
any Degree is closed against him who believes in one God and the soul's immortality, on account of the other tenets of his faith, that Degree is Masonry no longer. No Mason has the right to interpret the
symbols of this Degree for another, or to refuse him its mysteries, if he will not take them with the explanation and commentary superadded.
Listen, my brother, to our explanation of the symbols of the Degree, and then give them such further
interpretation as you think fit.
The Cross has been a sacred symbol from the earliest Antiquity. It is found upon all the enduring monuments of the world, in Egypt, in Assyria, in Hindostan, in Persia, and on the Buddhist towers of
Ireland. Buddha was said to have died upon it. The Druids cut an oak into its shape and held it sacred, and built their temples in that form. Pointing to the four quarters of the world, it was the symbol of
universal nature. It was on a cruciform tree, that Chrishna was said to have expired, pierced with arrows. It was revered in Mexico.
But its peculiar meaning in this Degree, is that given to it by the Ancient Egyptians. Tltoth or Phika is
represented on the oldest monuments carrying in his hand the Crux Ansata, or Ankh, [a Tau cross, with a ring or circle over it]. He is so seen on the double tablet of Shufu and Nob Shufu, builders of the
greatest of the Pyramids, at Wady Meghara, in the peninsula of Sinai. It was the hieroglyphic for life, and with a triangle prefixed meant life giving. To us therefore it is the symbol of Life of that life that
emanated from the Deity, and of that Eternal Life for which we all hope; through our faith in God's infinite goodness.
The ROSE was anciently sacred to Aurora and the Sun. It is a symbol of Dawn, of the resurrection of
Light and the renewal of life, and therefore of the dawn of the first day, and more particularly of the resurrection: and the Cross and Rose together are therefore hieroglyphically to be read, the Dawn of
Eternal Life which all Nations have hoped for by the advent of a Redeemer.
The Pelican feeding her young is an emblem of the large and bountiful beneficence of Nature, of the Redeemer of fallen man, and of that humanity and charity that ought to distinguish a Knight of this
Degree.

The Eagle was the living Symbol of the Egyptian God Mendes or Menthra, whom SesostrisRamses
made one with AmunRe, the God of Thebes and Upper Egypt, and the representative of the Sun, the word RE meaning Sun or King.
The Compass surmounted with a crown signifies that notwithstanding the high rank attained in
Masonry by a Knight of the Rose Croix, equity and impartiality are invariably to govern his conduct.
To the word INRI, inscribed on the Crux Ansata over the Master's Seat, many meanings have been assigned. The Christian Initiate reverentially sees in it the initials of the inscription upon the cross on
which Christ suffered Iesus Nazarenus Rex ludce orum. The sages of Antiquity connected it with one of the greatest secrets of Nature, that of universal regeneration. They inter preted it thus, Igne Natura
renovatur integra; [entire nature is renovated by fire]: The Alchemical or Hermetic Masons framed for it this aphorism, Igne nitrum roris invenitur. And the Jes uits are charged with having applied to it this
odious axiom, Justum necare reges impios. The four letters are the initials of the Hebrew words that represent the four elements lammim, the seas or water; Nour, fire; Rouach, the air and Iebeschah, the
dry earth. How we read it, I need not repeat to you.
The CROSS, X, was the Sign of the Creative Wisdom or Logos, the Son of God. Plato says, "He expressed him upon the Universe in the figure of the letter X. The next Power to the Supreme God was
decussated or figured in the shape of a Cross on the Universe." Mithras signed his soldiers on the forehead with a Cross. X is the mark of 600, the mysterious cycle of the Incarnations.
We constantly see the Tau and the Resh united thus P. These | | two letters, in the old Samaritan, as
found in Arius, stand, the first for 400, the second for 200=600. This is the Staff of Osiris, also, and his monogram, and was adopted by the Christians as a Sign. On a medal P of Constanius is this inscription,
"In hoc X | signo victor eris." An inscription in the Duomo at Milan reads, "X. et P. Christi. Nomina. Sancta. Tenei."
The Egyptians used as a Sign of their God Canobus, a T or a l indifferently. The Vaishnavas of India
have also the same Sacred Tau, which they also mark with crosses, and with triangles. The vestments of the ptiests of Horus were covered with these crosses. So was the dress of the Lama of Thibet. The
Sectarian marks of the Jains are similar. The distinctive badge of the Sect of Xac Jaonicus is the swastica. It is the Sign of Fo, identical with the Cross of Christ. On the ruins of Mandore, in India,
among other mystic emblems, are the mystic triangle, and the interlaced triangle. This is also found on ancient coins and medals, excavated from the ruins of Oojein and other ancient cities of India.

You entered here amid gloom and into shadow, and are clad in the apparel of sorrow. Lament, with us, the sad condition of the Human race, in this vale of tears! the calamities of men and the agonies of
nations! the darkness of the bewildered soul, oppressed by doubt and apprehension!
There is no human soul that is not sad at times. There is no thoughtful soul that does not at times despair. There is perhaps none, of all that think at all of anything beyond the needs and interests of the
body, that is not at times startled and terrified by the awful questions which, feeling as though it were a guilty thing for doing so, it whispers to itself in its inmost depths. Some Demon seems to torture it
with doubts, and to crush it with despair, asking whether, after all, it is certain that its convictions are true, and its faith well rounded: whether it is indeed sure that a God of Infinite Love and Beneficence
rules the Universe, or only some great remorseless Fate and iron Necessity, hid in impenetrable gloom, and to which men and their sufferings and sorrows. Their hopes and joys, their ambitions and deeds, are
of no more interest or importance than the motes that dance in the sunshine; or a Being that amuses Himself with the incredible vanity and folly, the writings and contortions of the insignificant insects
that compose Humanity, and idly imagine that they resemble the Omnipotent. "What are we," the Tempter asks, "but puppets in a showbox? O Omnipotent destiny, pull our strings gently! Dance us
mercifully off our miserable little stage!"
"Is it not," the Demon whispers, "merely the inordinate vanity of man that causes him now to pretend to himself that he is like unto God in intellect, sympathies and passions, as it was that which, at the
beginning, made him believe that he was, in his bodily shape and organs, the very image of the Deity? Is not his God merely his own shadow, projected in gigantic outlines upon the clouds? Does he not
create for himself a God out of himself, by merely adding indefinite extension to his own faculties, powers, and passions?"
"Who," the Voice that will not be always silent whispers, "has ever thoroughly satisfied himself with
his own arguments in respect to his own nature ? Who ever demonstrated to himself, with a conclusiveness that elevated the belief to certainty, that he was an immortal spirit, dwelling only
temporarily in the house and envelope of the body, and to live on forever after that shall have decayed? Who ever has demonstrated or ever can demonstrate that the intellect of Man differs from that of the
wiser animals, otherwise than in degree? Who has ever done more than to utter nonsense and incoherencies in regard to the difference between the instincts of the dog and the reason of Man? The
horse, the dog, the elephant, are as conscious of their identity as we are. They think, dream, remember, argue with themselves, devise, plan, and reason. What is the intellect and intelligence of the man but
the intellect of the animal in a higher degree or larger quantity?" In the real explanation of a single thought of a dog, all metaphysics will be condensed.
And with still more terrible significance, the Voice asks, in what respect the masses of men, the vast
swarms of the human race, have proven themselves either wiser or better than the animals in whose
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



226/641
eyes a higher intelligence shines than in their dull, unintellectural orbs; in what respect they have proven themselves worthy of or suited for an immortal life. Would that be a prize of any value to the
vast majority? Do they show, here upon earth, any capacity to improve, any fitness for a state of existence in which they could not crouch to power, like hounds dreading the lash, or tyrannize over
defenceless weakness;in which they could not hate, and persecute, and torture, and exterminate; in which they could not trade, and speculate, and overreach, and entrap the unwary and cheat the
confiding and gamble and thrive, and sniff with self righteousness at the shortcomings of others, and thank God that they were not like other men? What, to immense numbers of men, would be the value
of a Heaven where they could not lie and libel, and ply base avocations for profitable returns?
Sadly we look around us, and read the gloomy and dreary records of the old dead and rotten ages. More than eighteen centuries have staggered away into the spectral realm of the Past, since Christ, teaching
the Religion of Love, was crucified, that it might become a Religion of Hate; and His Doctrines are not yet even nominally accepted as true by a fourth of mankind. Since His death, what incalculable swarms
of human beings have lived and died in total unbelief of all that we deem essential to Salvation! What multitudinous myriads of souls, since the darkness of idolatrous superstition settled down, thick and
impenetrable, upon the earth, have flocked up toward the eternal Throne of God, to receive His judgment?
The Religion of Love proved to be, for seventeen long centuries, as much the Religion of Hate, and
infinitely more the Religion of Persecution, than Mahometanism, its unconquerable rival. Heresies grew up before the Apostles died; and God hated the Nicolaitans, while John, at Patmos, proclaimed
His coming wrath. Sects wrangled, and each, as it gained the power, persecuted the other, until the soil of the whole Christian world was watered with the blood, and fattened on the flesh, and whitened with
the bones, of martyrs, and human ingenuity was taxed to its utmost to invent new modes by which tortures and agonies could be prolonged and made more exquisite. "By what right," whispers the Voice,
"does this savage, merciless, persecuting animal, to which the sufferings and writhings of others of its wretched kind furnish the most pleasurable sensations, and the mass of which care only to eat, sleep, be
clothed, and wallow in sensual pleasures, and the best of which wrangle, hate, envy, and, with few exceptions, regard their own interests alone, with what right does it endeavor to delude itself into the
conviction that it is not an animal, as the wolf, the hyena, and the tiger are but a somewhat nobler, a spirit destined to be immortal, a spark of the essential Light, Fire and Reason, which are God? What
other immortality than one of selfishness could this creature enjoy? Of what other is it capable? Must not immortality commence here and is not life a part of it? How shall death change the base nature of
the base soul? Why have not those other animals that only faintly imitate the wanton, savage, human cruelty and thirst for blood, the same right as man has, to expect a resurrection and an Eternity of
existence, or a Heaven of Love?
The world improves. Man ceases to persecute, when the persecuted become too numerous and strong, longer to submit to it. That source of pleasure closed, men exercise the ingenuities of their cruelty on

the animals and other living things below them. To deprive other creatures of the life which God gave them, and this not only that we may eat their flesh for food, but out of mere savage wantonness, is the
agreeable employment and amusement of man, who prides himself on being the Lord of Creation, and a little lower than the Angels. If he can no longer use the rack, the gibbet, the pincers, and the stake, he
can hate, and slander, and delight in the thought that he will, hereafter, luxuriously enjoying the sensual beatitudes of Heaven, see with pleasure the writhing agonies of those justly damned for daring to hold
opinions contrary to his own, upon subjects totally beyond the comprehension both of them and him.
Where the armies of the despots cease to slay and ravage, the armies of "Freedom" take their place, and, the black and white commingled, slaughter and burn and ravish. Each age reenacts the crimes as
well as the follies of its predecessors, and still war licenses outrage and turns fruitful lands into deserts, and God is thanked in the Churches for bloody hutcheries, and the remorse less devastators, even when
swollen by plunder, are crowned with laurels and receive ovations.
Of the whole of mankind, not one in ten thousand has any aspirations beyond the daily needs of the gross animal life. In this age and in all others, all men except a few, in most countries, are born to be
mere beasts of burden, colaborers with the horse and the ox. Profoundly ignorant, even in "civilized" lands, they think and reason like the animals by the side of which they toil. For them, God, Soul, Spirit,
Immortality, are mere words, without any real meaning. The God of nineteentwentieths of the Christian world is only Bel, Moloch, Zeus, or at best Osiris, Mithras, or Adonai, under another name,
worshipped with the old Pagan ceremonies and ritualistic formulas. It is the Statue of Olympian Jove, worshipped as the Father, in the Christian Church that was a Pagan Temple; it is the Statue of Venus,
become the Virgin Mary. For the most part, men do not in their hearts believe that God is either just or merciful. They fear and shrink from His lightnings and dread His wrath. For the most part, they only
think they believe that there is another life, a judgment, and a punishment for sin. Yet they will none the less persecute as Infidels and Atheists those who do not believe what they themselves imagine they
believe, and which yet they do not believe, because it is incomprehensible to them in their ignorance and want of intellect. To the vast majority of mankind, God is but the reflected image, in infinite space,
of the earthly Tyrant on his Throne, only more powerful, more inscrutable, and more implacable. To curse Humanity, the Despot need only be, what the popular mind has, in every age, imagined God.
In the great cities, the lower strata of the populace are equally without faith and without hope. The
others have, for the most part, a mere blind faith, imposed by education and circumstances, and not as productive of moral excellence or even common honesty as Mohammedanism. "Your property will be
safe here," said the Moslem; "There are no Christians here." The philosophical and scientific world becomes daily more and more unbelieving. Faith and Reason are not opposites, in equilibrium; but
antagonistic and hostile to each other; the result being the darkness and despair of scepticism, avowed, or halfveiled as rationalism.

Over more than threefourths of the habitable globe, humanity still kneels, like the camels, to take upon itself the burthens to be tamely borne for its tyrants. If a Republic occasionally rises like a Star, it
hastens with all speed to set in blood. The kings need not make war upon it, to crush it out of their way. It is only necessary to let it alone, and it soon lays violent hands upon itself. And when a people long
enslaved shake off its fetters, it may well be incredulously asked,
Shall the braggart shout For some blind glimpse of Freedom, link itself, Through madness, hated by the wise, to law, System and Empire?
Everywhere in the world labor is, in some shape, the slave of capital; generally, a slave to be fed only so
long as he can work; or, rather, only so long as his work is profitable to the owner of the human chattel. There are famines in Ireland, strikes and starvation in England, pauperism and tenementdens in New
York, misery, squalor, ignorance, destitution, the brutality of vice and the insensibility to shame, of despairing beggary, in all the human cesspools and sewers everywhere. Here, a sewingwoman
famishes and freezes; there, mothers murder their children, that those spared may live upon the bread purchased with the burial allowances of the dead starveling; and at the next door young girls prostitute
themselves for food.
Moreover, the Voice says, this besotted race is not satisfied with seeing its multitudes swept away by the great epidemics whose causes are unknown, and of the justice or wisdom of which the human mind
cannot conceive. It must also be ever at war. There has not been a moment since men divided into Tribes, when all the world was at peace. Always men have been engaged in murdering each other
somewhere. Always the armies have lived by the toil of the husbandman, and war has exhausted the resources, wasted the energies, and ended the prosperity of Nations. Now it loads unborn posterity
with crushing debt, mortgages all estates, and brings upon States the shame and infamy of dishonest repudiation.
At times, the baleful fires of war light up half a Continent at once; as when all the Thrones unite to
compel a people to receive again a hated and detestable dynasty, or States deny States the right to dissolve an irksome union and create for themselves a seperate government. Then again the flames
flicker and die away, and the fire smoulders in its ashes, to break out again, after a time, with renewed and a more concentrated fury. At times, the storm, revolving, howls over small areas only; at times its
lights are seen, like the old beaconfires on the hills, belting the whole globe. No sea, but hears the roar of cannon; no river, but runs red with blood; no plain, but shakes, trampled by the hoofs of charging
squadrons; no field, but is fertilized by the blood of the dead; and everywhere man slays, the vulture gorges and the wolf howls in the ear of the dying soldier. No city is not tortured by shot and shell; and
no people fail to enact the horrid blasphemy of thanking a God of Love for victories and carnage. Te Deums are still sung for the Eve of St. Bartholomew and the Sicilian Vespers. Man's ingenuity is
racked, and all his inventive powers are tasked, to fabricate the infernal enginery of destruction, by

which human bodies may be the more expeditiously and effectually crushed, shattered, torn, and mangled; and yet hypocritical Humanity, drunk with blood and drenched with gore, shrieks to Heaven
at a single murder, perpetrated to gratify a revenge not more unchristian, or to satisfy a cupidity not more ignoble, than those which are the promptings of the Devil in the souls of Nations.
When we have fondly dreamed of Utopia and the Millennium, when we have begun almost to believe
that man is not, after all, a tiger half tamed, and that the smell of blood will not wake the sav age within him, we are of a sudden startled from the delusive dream, to find the thin mask of civilization
rent in twain and thrown contemptuously away. We lie down to sleep, like the peas ant on the lava slopes of Vesuvius. The mountain has been so long inert, that we believe its fires extinguished. Round
us hang the clustering grapes, and the green leaves of the olive tremble in the soft nightair over us. Above us shine the peaceful, patient stars. The crash of a new eruption wakes us, the roar of the
subterranean thunders, the stabs of the volcanic lightning into the shrouded bosom of the sky; and we see, aghast, the tortured Titan hurling up its fires among the pale stars, its great tree of smoke and
cloud, the red torrents pouring down its sides. The roar and the shriekings of Civil War are all around us: the land is a pandemonium: man is again a Savage. The great armies roll along their hideous waves,
and leave behind them smoking and depopulated deserts. The pillager is in every house, plucking even the morsel of bread from the lips of the starving child. Gray hairs are dabbled in blood, and innocent
girlhood shrieks in vain to Lust for mercy. Laws, Courts, Constitutions, Christianity, Mercy, Pity, disappear. God seems to have abdicated, and Moloch to reign in His stead; while Press and Pulpit alike
exult at universal murder, and urge the extermination of the Conquered, by the sword and the flaming torch; and to plunder and murder entitles the human beasts of prey to the thanks of Christian Senates.
Commercial greed deadens the nerves of sympathy of Nations, and makes them deaf to the demands of
honor, the impulses of generosity, the appeals of those who suffer under injustice. Elsewhere, the universal pursuit of wealth dethrones God and pays divine honors to Mammon and Baalzebub.
Selfishness rules supreme: to win wealth becomes the whole business of life. The villanies of legalized gaming and speculation become epidemic; treacery is but evidence of shrewdness; office becomes the
prey of successful faction; the Country, like Actaeon, is torn by its own hounds, and the villains it has carefully educated to their trade, most greedily plunder it, when it is in extremis.
By what right, the Voice demands, does a creature always engaged in the work of mutual robbery and
slaughter, and who makes his own interest his God, claim to be of a nature superior to the savage beasts of which he is the prototype?
Then the shadows of a horrible doubt fall upon the soul that would fain love, trust and believe; a
darkness, of which this that surrounded you was a symbol. It doubts the truth of Revelation, its own spirituality, the very existence of a beneficent God. It asks itself if it is not idle to hope for any great
progress of Humanity toward perfection, and whether, when it advances in one respect, it does not

retrogress in some other, by way of compensation: whether advance in civilization is not increase of selfishness: whether freedom does not necessarily lead to license and anarchy: whether the destitution
and debasement of the masses does not inevitably follow increase of population and commercial and manufacturing prosperity. It asks itself whether man is not the sport of blind, merciless Fate: whether
all philosophies are not delusions, and all religions the fantastic creations of human vanity and self conceit; and above all, whether, when Reason is abandoned as a guide, the faith of Buddhist and
Brahmin has not the same claims to sovereignty and implicit, unreasoning credence, as any other.
He asks himself whether it is not, after all, the evident and palpable injustices of this life, the success and prosperity of the Bad, the calamities, oppressions, and miseries of the Good, that are the bases of
all beliefs in a future state of existence? Doubting man's capacity for indefinite progress here, he doubts the possibility of it anywher; and if he does not doubt whether God exists, and is just and beneficent, he
at least cannot silence the constantly recurring whisper, that the miseries and calamities of men, their lives and deaths, their pains and sorrows, their extermination by war and epidemics, are phenomena of
no higher dignity, significance, and importance, in the eye of God, than what things of the same nature occur to other organisms of matter; and that the fish of the ancient seas, destroyed by myriads to make
room for other species, the contorted shapes in which they are found as fossils testifying to their agonies; the coral insects, the animals and birds and vermin slain by man, have as much right as he to
clamor at the injustice of the dispensations of God, and to demand an immortality of life in a new universe, as compensation for their pains and sufferings and untimely death in this world.
This is not a picture painted by the imagination. Many a thoughtful mind has so doubted and despaired.
How many of us can say that our own faith is so well grounded and complete that we never hear those painful whisperings within the soul? Thrice blessed are they who never doubt, who ruminate in patient
contentment like the kine, or doze under the opiate of a blind faith; on whose souls never rests that Awful Shadow which is the absence of the Divine Light.
To explain to themselves the existence of Evil and Suffering, the Ancient Persians imagined that there
were two Principles or Deities in the Universe, the one of Good and the other of Evil, constantly in conflict with each other in struggle for the mastery and alternately overcoming and overcome. Over
both, for the SAGES, was the One Supreme; and for them Light was in the end to prevail over Darkness, the Good over the Evil, and even Ahriman and his Demons to part with their wicked and
vicious natures and share the universal Salvation. It did not occur to them that the existence of the Evil Principle, by the consent of the Omnipotent Supreme, presented the same difficulty, and left the
existence of Evil as unexplained as before. The human mind is always content, if it can remove a difficulty a step further off. It cannot believe that the world rests on nothing, but is devoutly content
when taught that it is borne on the back of an immense elephant, who himself stands on the back of a tortoise. Given the tortoise, Faith is always satisfied; and it has been a great source of happiness to
multitudes that they could believe in a Devil who could relieve God of the odium of being the Author of Sin.

But not to all is Faith sufficient to overcome this great difficulty. They say, with the Suppliant, "Lord! I
believe!" but like him they are constrained to add, "Help Thou my unbelief!" Reason must, for these, cooperate and coincide with Faith, or they remain still in the darkness of doubt, most miserable of all
conditions of the human mind.
Those only, who care for nothing beyond the interests and pursuits of this life, are uninterested in these great Problems. The animals, also, do not consider them. It is the characteristic of an immortal Soul,
that it should seek to satisfy itself of its immortality, and to understand this great enigma, the Universe. If the Hottentot and the Papuan are not troubled and tortured by these doubts and speculations, they are
not, for that, to be regarded as either wise or fortunate. The swine, also, are indifferent to the great riddles of the Universe, and are happy in being wholly unaware that it is the vast Revelation and
Manifestation, in Time and Space, of a Single Thought of the Infinite God.
Exalt and magnify Faith as we will, and say that it begins where Reason ends, it must, after all, have a foundation, either in Reason, Analogy, the Consciousness, or human testimony. The worshipper of
Brahma also has implicit Faith in what seems to us palpably false and absurd. His faith rests neither in Reason, Analogy, or the Consciousness, but on the testimony of his Spiritual teachers, and of the Holy
Books. The Moslem also believes, on the positive testimony of the Prophet and the Mormon also can say, "I believe this, because it is impossible." No faith, how ever absurd or degrading, has ever wanted
these foundations, testimony, and the books. Miracles, proven by unimpeachable testimony have been used as a foundation for Faith, in every age; and the modern miracles are better authenticated, a
hundred times, than the ancient ones.
So that, after all, Faith must flow out from some source within us, when the evidence of that which we are to believe is not presented to our senses, or it will in no case be the assurance of the truth of what is
believed.
The Consciousness, or inhering and innate conviction, or the instinct divinely implanted, of the verity of things, is the highest possible evidence, if not the only real proof, of the verity of certain things, but
only of truths of a limited class.
What we call the Reason, that is, our imperfect human reason, not only may, but assuredly will, lead us away from the Truth in regard to things invisible and especially those of the Infinite, if we determine to
believe nothing but that which it can demonstrate or not to believe that which it can by its processes of logic prove to be contradictory, unreasonable, or absurd. Its tapeline cannot measure the arcs of
Infinity. For example, to the Human reason, an Infinite Justice and an Infinite Mercy or Love, in the same Being, are inconsistent and impossible. One, it can demonstrate, necessarily excludes the other.

So it can demonstrate that as the Creation had a beginning, it necessarily follows that an Eternity had elapsed before the Deity began to create, during which He was inactive.
When we gaze, of a moonless clear night, on the Heavens glittering with stars, and know that each fixed
star of all the myriads is a Sun, and each probably possessing its retinue of worlds, all peopled with living beings, we sensibly feel our own unimportance in the scale of Creation, and at once reflect that
much of what has in different ages been religious faith, could never have been believed, if the nature, size, and distance of those Suns, and of our own Sun, Moon, and Planets, had been known to the
Ancients as they are to us.
To them, all the lights of the firmament were created only to give light to the earth, as its lamps or candles hung above it. The earth was supposed to be the only inhabited portion of the Universe. The
world and the Universe were synonymous terms. Of the immense size and distance of the heavenly bodies, men had no conception. The Sages had, in Chaldaea, Egypt, India, China, and in Persia, and
therefore the sages always had, an esoteric creed, taught only in the mysteries and unknown to the vulgar. No Sage, in either country, or in Greece or Rome, believed the popular creed. To them the Gods
and the Idols of the Gods were symbols, and symbols of great and mysterious truths.
The Vulgar imagined the attention of the Gods to be continually centred upon the earth and man. The Grecian Divinities inhabited Olympus, an insignificant mountain of the Earth. There was the Court of
Zeus, to which Neptune came from the Sea, and Pluto and Persephone from the glooms of Tartarus in the unfathomable depths of the Earth's bosom.
God came down from Heaven and on Sinai dictated laws for the Hebrews to His servant Moses. The
Stars were the guardians of mortals whose fates and fortunes were to be read in their movements, conjunctions, and oppositions. The Moon was the Bride and Sister of the Sun, at the same distance
above the Earth, and, like the Sun, made for the service of mankind alone.
If, with the great telescope of Lord Rosse, we examine the vast nebulae of Hercules, Orion, and Andromeda, and find them resolvable into Stars more numerous than the sands on the seashore; if we
reflect that each of these Stars is a Sun, like and even many times larger than ours, each, beyond a doubt, with its retinue of worlds swarming with life; if we go further in imagination and endeavor to
conceive of all the infinities of space, filled with similar suns and worlds, we seem at once to shrink into an incredible insignificance.
The Universe, which is the uttered Word of God, is infinite in extent. There is no empty space beyond
creation on any side. The Universe, which is the Thought of God pronounced, never was not, since God never was inert; nor WAS, without thinking and creating. The forms of creation change, the suns and

worlds live and die like the leaves and the insects, but the Universe itself is infinite and eternal, because God Is, Was and Will forever Be, and never did not think and create.
Reason is fain to admit that a Supreme Intelligence, infinitely powerful and wise, must have created this
boundless Universe; but it also tells us that we are as unimportant in it as the zoophytes and entozoa, or as the invisible particles of animated life that float upon the air or swarm in the waterdrop.
The foundations of our faith, resting upon the imagined interest of God in our race, an interest easily
supposable when man believed himself the only intelligent created being, and therefore eminently worthy the especial care and watchful anxiety of a God who had only this earth to look after, and its
housekeeping alone to superintend, and who was content to create, in all the infinite Universe, only one single being, possessing a soul, and not a mere animal, are rudely shaken as the Universe broadens
and expands for us and the darkness of doubt and distrust settles heavy upon Soul.
The modes in which it is ordinarily endeavored to satisfy our doubts, only increase them. To demonstrate the necessity for a cause of the creation, is equally to demonstrate the necessity of a cause
for that cause. The argument from plan and design only removes the difficulty a step further off. We rest the world on the elephant, and the elephant on the tortoise, and the tortoise on nothing.
To tell us that the animals possess instinct only and that Reason belongs to us alone, in no way tends to
satisfy us of the radical difference between us and them. For if the mental phenomena exhibited by animals that think, dream, remember, argue from cause to effect, plan, devise, combine, and
communicate their thoughts to each other, so as to act rationally in concert, if their love, hate, and revenge, can be conceived of as results of the organization of matter, like color and perfume, the resort
to the hypothesis of an immaterial Soul to explain phenomena of the same kind, only more perfect, manifested by the human being, is supremely absurd. That organized matter can think or even feel, at
all, is the great insoluble mystery. "Instinct" is but a word without a meaning, or else it means inspiration. It is either the animal itself, or God in the animal, that thinks, remembers, and reasons and
instinct, according to the common acceptation of the term, would be the greatest and most wonderful of mysteries, no less a thing than the direct, immediate, and continual promptings of the Deity, for the
animals are not machines, or automata moved by springs, and the ape is but a dumb Australian.
Must we always remain in this darkness of uncertainty, of doubt? Is there no mode of escaping from the labyrinth except by means of a blind faith, which explains nothing, and in many creeds, ancient and
modern, sets Reason at defiance, and leads to the belief either in a God without a Universe, a Universe without a God, or a Universe which is itself a God?
We read in the Hebrew Chronicles that Schlomoh the wise King caused to be placed in front of the

entrance to the Temple two huge columns of bronze, one of which was called YAKAYIN and the other BAHAZ; and these words are rendered in our version Strength and Establishment. The Masonry of the
Blue Lodges gives no explanation of these symbolic columns; nor do the Hebrew Books advise us that they were symbolic. If not so intended as symbols, they were subsequently understood to be such.
But as we are certain that everything within the Temple was symbolic, and that the whole structure was
intended to represent the Universe, we may reasonably conclude that the columns of the portico also had a symbolic signification. It would be tedious to repeat all the interpretations which fancy or
dullness has found for them.
The key to their true meaning is not undiscoverable. The perfect and eternal distinction of the two primitive terms of the creative syllogism, in order to attain to the demonstration of their harmony by the
analogy of contraries, is the second grand principle of that occult philosophy veiled under the name "Kabalah," and indicated by all the sacred hieroglyphs of the Ancient Sanctuaries, and of the rites, so
little understood by the mass of the Initiates, of the Ancient and Modern FreeMasonry.
The Sohar declares that everything in the Universe proceeds by the mystery of "the Balance," that is, of Equilibrium. Of the Sephiroth, or Divine Emanations, Wisdom and Understanding, Severity and
Benignity, or Justice and Mercy, and Victory and Glory, constitute pairs.
Wisdom, or the Intellectual Generative Energy, and Understanding, or the Capacity to be impregnated by the Active Energy and produce intellection or thought, are represented symbolically in the Kabalah
as male and female. So also are Justice and Mercy. Strength is the intellectual Energy or Activity; Establishment or Stability is the intellectual Capacity to produce, a Tpassivity. They are the POWER of
generation and the CAPACITY of production. By WISDOM, it is said, God creates, and by UNDERSTANDING establishes. These are the two Columns of the Temple, contraries like the Man
and Woman, like Reason and Faith, Omnipotence and Liberty, Infinite Justice and Infinite Mercy, Absolute Power or Strength to do even what is most unjust and unwise, and Absolute Wisdom that
makes it impossible to do it; Right and Duty. They were the columns of the intellectual and moral world, the monumental hieroglyph of the antinomy necessary to the grand law of creation.
There must be for every Force a Resistance to support it, to every light a shadow, for every Royalty a
Realm to govern, for every affirmative a negative.
For the Kabalists, Light represents the Active Principle, and Darkness or Shadow is analogous to the Passive Principle. Therefore it was that they made of the Sun and Moon emblems of the two Divine
Sexes and the two creative forces; therefore, that they ascribed to woman the Temptation and the first sin, and then the first labor, the maternal labor of the redemption, because it is from the bosom of the

235/641
darkness itself that we see the Light born again. The Void attracts the Full; and so it is that the abyss of poverty and misery, the Seeming Evil, the seeming empty nothingness of life, the temporary rebellion
of the creatures, eternally attracts the overflowing ocean of being, of riches, of pity, and of love. Christ completed the Atonement on the Cross by descending into Hell.
Justice and Mercy are contraries. If each be infinite, their coexistence seems impossible, and being
equal, one cannot even annihilate the other and reign alone. The mysteries of the Divine Nature are beyond our finite comprehension; but so indeed are the mysteries of our own finite nature; and it is
certain that in all nature harmony and movement are the result of the equilibrium of opposing or contrary forces.
The analogy of contraries gives the solution of the most interesting and most difficult problem of
modern philosophy, the definite and permanent accord of Reason and Faith, of Authority and Liberty of examination, of Science and Belief, of Perfection in God and Imperfection in Man. If science or
knowledge is the Sun, Belief is the Man; it is a reflection of the day in the night. Faith is the veiled Isis, the Supplement of Reason, in the shadows which precede or follow Reason. It emanates from the
Reason, but can never confound it nor be confounded with it. The encroachments of Reason upon Faith, or of Faith on Reason, are eclipses of the Sun or Moon; when they occur, they make useless both the
Source of Light and its reflection, at once.
Science perishes by systems that are nothing but beliefs and Faith succumbs to reasoning. For the two Columns of the Temple to uphold the edifice, they must remain separated and be parallel to each other.
As soon as it is attempted by violence to bring them together, as Samson did, they are overturned, and the whole edifice falls upon the head of the rash blind man or the revolutionist whom personal or
national resentments have in advance devoted to death.
Harmony is the result of an alternating preponderance of forces. Whenever this is wanting in government, government is a failure, because it is either Despotism or Anarchy. All theoretical
governments, however plausible the theory, end in one or the other. Governments that are to endure are not made in the closet of Locke or Shaftesbury, or in a Congress or a Convention. In a Republic, forces
that seem contraries, that indeed are contraries, alone give movement and life. The Spheres are field in their orbits and made to revolve harmoniously and unerringly, by the concurrence, which seems to be
the opposition, of two contrary forces. If the centripetal force should overcome the centrifugal, the equilibrium of forces cease, the rush of the Spheres to the central Sun would annihilate the system.
Instead of consolidation, the whole would be shattered into fragments.
Man is a free agent, though Omnipotence is above and all around him. To be free to do good, he must be free to do evil. The Light necessitates the Shadow. A State is free like an individual in any

government worthy of the name. The State is less potent than the Deity, and therefore the freedom of the individual citizen is consistent with its Sovereignty. These are opposites, but not antagonistic. So,
in a union of States, the freedom of the states is consistent with the Supremacy of the Nation. When either obtains the permanent mastery over the other, and they cease to be in equilibrio, the
encroachment continues with a velocity that is accelerated like that of a falling body, until the feebler is annihilated, and then, there being no resistance to support the stronger, it rushes into ruin.
So, when the equipoise of Reason and Faith, in the individual or the Nation, and the alternating
preponderance cease, the result is, according as one or the other is permanent victor, Atheism or Superstition, disbelief or blind credulity; and the Priests either of Unfaith or of Faith become despotic.
"Whomsoever God loveth, him he chasteneth," is an expression that formulates a whole dogma. The
trials of life are the blessings of life, to the individual or the Nation, if either has a Soul that is truly worthy of salvation. "Light and darkness," said ZOROASTER, "are the world's eternal ways." The
Light and the Shadow are everywhere and always in proportion; the Light being the reason of being of the Shadow. It is by trials only, by the agonies of sorrow and the sharp discipline of adversities, that
men and Nations attain initiation. The agonies of the garden of Gethsemane and those of the Cross on Calvary preceded the Resurrection and were the means of Redemption. It is with prosperity that God
afflicts Humanity.
The Degree of Rose is devoted to and symbolizes tne final triumph of truth over falsehood, of liberty over slavery, of light over darkness, of life over death, and of good over evil. The great truth it
inculcates is, that notwithstanding the existence of Evil, God is infinitely wise, just, and good: that though the affairs of the world proceed by no rule of right and wrong known to us in the narrowness of
our views, yet all is right, for it is the work of God; and all evils, all miseries, all misfortunes, are but as drops in the vast current that is sweeping onward, guided by Him, to a great and magnificent result:
that, at the appointed time, He will redeem and regenerate the world, and the Principle, the Power, and the existence of Evil will then cease; that this will be brought about by such means and instruments as
He chooses to employ; whether by the merits of a Redeemer that has already appeared, or a Messiah that is yet waited for, by an incarnation of Himself, or by an inspired prophet, it does not belong to us as
Masons to decide. Let each judge and believe for himself.
In the mean time, we labor to hasten the coming of that day. The morals of antiquity, of the law of Moses and of Christianity, are ours. We recognize every teacher of Morality, every Reform er, as a
brother in this great work. The Eagle is to us the symbol of Liberty, the Compasses of Equality, the Pelican of Humanity and our order of Fraternity. Laboring for these, with Faith, Hope, and Charity as
our armor, we will wait with patience for the final triumph of Good and the complete manifestation of the Word of God.

No one Mason has the right to measure for another, within the walls of a Masonic Temple, the degree of veneration which he shall feel for any Reformer, or the Founder of any Religion. We teach a belief in
no particular creed, as we teach unbelief in none. Whatever higher attributes the Founder of the Christian Faith may, in our belief, have had or not have had, none can deny that He taught and practised
a pure and elevated morality, even at the risk and to the ultimate loss of His life. He was not only the benefactor of a disinherited people, but a model for mankind. Devotedly He loved the children of Israel.
To them He came, and to them alone He preached that Gospel which His disciples afterward carried among foreigners. He would fain have freed the chosen People from their spiritual bondage of
ignorance and degradation. As a lover of all mankind, laying down His life for the emancipation of His Brethren, He should be to all, to Christian, to Jew, and to Mahometan, an object of gratitude and
veneration.
The Roman world felt the pangs of approaching dissolution. Paganism, its Temples shattered by Socrates and Cicero, had spoken its last word. The God of the Hebrews was unknown beyond the limits
of Palestine. The old religions had failed to give happiness and peace to the world. The babbling and wrangling philosophers had confounded all men's ideas, until they doubted of everything and had faith
in nothing: neither in God nor in his goodness and mercy, nor in the virtue of man, nor in themselves. Mankind was divided into two great classes, the master and the slave; the powerful and the abject, the
high and the low, the tyrants and the mob; and even the former were satiated with the servility of the latter, sunken by lassitude and despair to the low est depths of degradation.
When, lo, a voice, in the inconsiderable Roman Province of Judea proclaims a new Gospel a new
"God's Word," to crushed, suffering, bleeding humanity. Liberty of Thought, Equality of all men in the eye of God, universal Fraternity! a new doctrine, a new religion; the old Primitive Truth uttered once
again!
Man is once more taught to look upward to his God. No longer to a God hid in impenetrable mystery, and infinitely remote from human sympathy, emerging only at intervals from the darkness to smite and
crush humanity: but a God, good, kind, beneficent, and merciful; a Father, loving the creatures He has made, with a love immeasurable and exhaustless; Who feels for us, and sympathizes with us, and sends
us pain and want and disaster only that they may serve to develop in us the virtues and excellences that befit us to live with Him hereafter.
Jesus of Nazareth, the "Son of man," is the expounder of the new Law of Love. He calls to Him the
humble, the poor, the Paraihs of the world. The first sentence that He pronounces blesses the world, and announces the new gospel: "Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted." He pours the
oil of consolation and peace upon every crushed and bleeding heart. Every sufferer is His proselyte. He shares their sorrows, and sympathizes with all their afflictions.

He raises up the sinner and the Samaritan woman, and teaches them to hope for forgiveness. He pardons the woman taken in adultery. He selects his disciples not among the Pharisees or the
Philosophers, but among the low and humble, even of the fishermen of Galilee. He heals the sick and feeds the poor. He lives among the destitute and the friendless. "Suffer little children," He said, "to
come unto me; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven! Blessed are the humbleminded, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven; the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth; the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy;
the pure in heart, for they shall see God; the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God!
First be reconciled to they brother, and then come and offer thy gift at the altar. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away! Love your enemies; bless them that curse
you; do good to them that hate you; and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you! All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye also unto them; for this is the law and
the Prophets! He that taketh not his cross, and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another: as I have loved you, that ye also love one
another: by this shall all know that ye are My disciples. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend."
The Gospel of Love He sealed with His life. The cruelty of the Jewish Priesthood, the ignorant ferocity
of the mob, and the Roman indifference to barbarian blood, nailed Him to the cross, and He expired uttering blessings upon humanity.
Dying thus, He bequeathed His teachings to man as an inestimable inheritance. Perverted and
corrupted, they have served as a basis for many creeds, and been even made the warrant for in tolerance and persecution. We here teach them in their purity. They are our Masonry; for to them good
men of all creeds can subscribe.
That God is good and merciful, and loves and sympathizes with the creatures He has made; that His finger is visible in all the movements of the moral, intellectual, and material universe; that we are His
children, the objects of His paternal care and regard; that all men are our brothers, whose wants we are to supply, their errors to pardon, their opinions to tolerate, their injuries to for give; that man has an
immortal soul, a free will, a right to freedom of thought and action; that all men are equal in God's sight; that we best serve God by humility, meekness, gentleness, kind ness, and the other virtues which
the lowly can practise as well as the lofty; this is "the new Law," the "WORD," for which the world had waited and pined so long; and every true Knight of the Rose + will revere the memory of Him who
taught it, and look indulgently even on those who assign to Him a character far above his own conceptions or belief, even to the extent of deeming Him Divine.

and sometimes toward barrenness, though ever advancing, is illuminated by the primitive ideas, the rays that emanate from the Divine Intelligence, whenever it ascends toward the Sublime Treasures. When,
on the contrary, it descends, and is barren, it falls within the domain of those Intelligences that are termed Angels for, when the soul is deprived of the light of God, which leads it to the knowledge of
things, it no longer enjoys more than a feeble and secondary light, which gives it, not the understanding of things, but that of words only, as in this baser world. "

Reveal it to no Profane! Keep and contain it within yourselves, as an incorruptible treasure, not like gold or silver, but more precious than everything besides; for it is the knowledge of the Great Cause, of
Nature, and of that which is born of both. And if you meet an Initiate, besiege him with your prayers, that he conceal from you no new mysteries that he may know, and rest not until you have obtained
them! For me, although I was initiated in the Great Mysteries by Moses, the Friend of God, yet, having seen Jeremiah, I recognized him not only as an Initiate, but as a Hierophant; and I follow his school."
We, like him, recognize all Initiates as our Brothers. We belong to no one creed or school. In all
religions there is a basis of Truth; in all there is pure Morality. All that teach the cardinal tenets of Masonry we respect; all teachers and reformers of mankind we admire and revere.
Masonry also has her mission to perform. With her traditions reaching back to the earliest times, and
her symbols dating further back than even the monumental history of Egypt extends, she invites all men of all religions to enlist under her banners and to war against evil, ignorance and wrong. You are now
her knight, and to her service your sword is consecrated. May you prove a worthy soldier in a worthy cause!
XIX. GRAND PONTIFF.
The true Mason labors for the benefit of those who are to come after him, and for the advancement and improvement of his race. That is a poor ambition which contents itself within the limits of a single life.
All men who deserve to live, desire to survive their funerals, and to live afterward in the good that they have done mankind, rather than in the fading characters written in men's memories. Most men desire to
leave some work behind them that may outlast their own day and brief generation. That is an instinctive

impulse, given by God, and often found in the rudest human heart; the surest proof of the soul's immortality, and of the fundamental difference between man and the wisest brutes. To plant the trees
that, after we are dead, shall shelter our children, is as natural as to love the shade of those our fathers planted. The rudest unlettered husbandman, painfully conscious of his own inferiority, the poorest
widowed mother, giving her lifeblood to those who pay only for the work of her needle, will toil and stint themselves to educate their child, that he may take a higher station in the world than they; and of
such are the world's greatest benefactors.
In his influences that survive him, man becomes immortal, before the general resurrection. The Spartan mother, who, giving her son his shield, said, "WITH IT, OR UPON IT!" afterward shared the
government of Lacedaemon with the legislation of Lycurgus; for she too made a law, that lived after her; and she inspired the Spartan soldiery that afterward demolished the walls of Athens, and aided
Alexander to conquer the Orient. The widow who gave Marion the fiery arrows to burn her own house, that it might no longer shelter the enemies of her infant country, the house where she had lain upon her
husband's bosom and where her children had been born, legislated more effectually for her State than Locke or Shaftesbury, or than many a Legislature has done, since that State won its freedom.
It was of slight importance to the Kings of Egypt and the Monarchs of Assyria and Phcenicia, that the
son of a Jewish woman, a foundling, adopted by the daughter of Sesostris Ramses, slew an Egyptian that oppressed a Hebrew slave, and fled into the desert, to remain there forty years. But Moses, who
might other wise have become Regent of Lower Egypt, known to us only by a tablet on a tomb or monument, became the deliverer of the Jews, and led them forth from Egypt to the frontiers of
Palestine, and made for them a law, out of which grew the Christian faith and so has shaped the destinies of the world. He and the old Roman lawyers, with Alfred of England, the Saxon Thanes and
Norman Barons, the old judges and chancellors, and the makers of the canons, lost in the mists and shadows of the Past, these are our legislators; and we obey the laws that they enacted.
Napoleon died upon the barren rock of his exile. His bones, borne to France by the son of a King, rest
in the Hopital des Invalides, in the great city on the Seine. His Thoughts still govern France. He, and not the People, dethroned the Bourbon, and drove the last King of the House of Orleans into exile. He,
in his coffin, and not the People, voted the crown to the Third Napoleon and he, and not the Generals of France and England, led their united forces against the grim Northern Despotism.
Mahomet announced to the Arabian idolaters the new creed, "There is but one God, and Mahomet, like
Moses and Christ, is His Apostle." For many years unaided, then with the help of his family and a few friends, then with many disciples, and last of all with an army, he taught and preached the Koran. The
religion of the wild Arabian enthusiast converting the fiery Tribes of the Great Desert, spread over Asia, built up the Saracenic dynasties, conquered Persia and India, the Greek Empire, Northern Africa,
and Spain, and dashed the surges of its fierce soldiery against the battlements of Northern Christendom.

The law of Mahomet still governs a fourth of the human race; and Turk and Arab, Moor and Persian and Hindu, still obey the Prophet, and pray with their faces turned toward Mecca; and he, and not the
living, rules and reigns in the fairest portions of the Orient.
Confucius still enacts the law for China; and the thoughts and ideas of Peter the Great govern Russia. Plato and the other great Sages of Antiquity still reign as the Kings of Philosophy, and have dominion
over the human intellect. The great Statesmen of the past still preside in the Councils of Nations. Burke still lingers in the House of Commons and Berryer's sonorous tones will long ring in the
Legislative Chambers of France. The influences of Webster and Calhoun, conflicting, rent asunder the American States, and the doctrine of each is the law and the oracle speaking from the Holy of Holies
for his own State and all consociated with it: a faith preached and proclaimed by each at the cannon's mouth and consecrated by rivers of blood.
It has been well said, that when Tamerlane had builded his pyramid of fifty thousand human skulls, and
wheeled away with his vast armies from the gates of Damascus, to find new conquests, and build other pyramids, a little boy was playing in the streets of Mentz, son of a poor artisan, whose apparent
importance in the scale of beings was, compared With that of Tamerlane, as that of a grain of sand to the giant bulk of the earth; but Tamerlane and all his shaggy legions, that swept over the East like a
hurricane, have passed away, and become shadows; while printing, the wonderful invention of John Faust, the boy of Mentz, has exerted a greater influence on man's destinies and overturned more thrones
and dynasties than all the victories of all the bloodstained conquerors from Nimrod to Napoleon.
Long ages ago, the Temple built by Solomon and our Ancient Brethren sank into ruin, when the Assyrian Armies sacked Jerusalem. The Holy City is a mass of hovels cowering under the dominion of
the Crescent and the Holy Land is a desert. The Kings of Egypt and Assyria, who were contemporaries of Solomon, are forgotten, and their histories mere fables. The Ancient Orient is a shattered wreck,
bleaching on the shores of Time. The Wolf and the Jackal howl among the ruins of Thebes and of Tyre, and the sculptured images of the Temples and Palaces of Babylon and Nineveh are dug from their ruins
and carried into strange lands. But the quiet and peaceful Order, of which the Son of a poor Phcenician Widow was one of the Grand Masters, with the Kings of Israel and Tyre, has continued to increase in
stature and influence, defying the angry waves of time and the storms of persecution. Age has not weakened its wide foundations, nor shattered its columns, nor marred the beauty of its harmonious
proportions. Where rude barbarians, in the time of Solomon, peopled inhospitable howling wildernesses, in France and Britain, and in that New World, not known to Jew or Gentile, until the
glories of the Orient had faded, that Order has builded new Temples, and teaches to its millions of Initiates those lessons of peace, goodwill and toleration, of reliance on God and confidence in man,
which it learned when Hebrew and Giblemite worked side by side on the slopes of Lebanon, and the Servant of Jehovah and the Phoenician Worshipper of Bel sat with the humble artisan in Council at
Jerusalem.

It is the Dead that govern. The Living only obey. And if the Soul sees, after death, what passes on this earth, and watches over the welfare of those it loves, then must its greatest happiness consist in seeing
the current of its beneficent influences widening out from age to age, as rivulets widen into rivers, and aiding to shape the destinies of individuals, families, States, the World; and its bitterest punishment, in
seeing its evil influences causing mischief and misery, and cursing and afflicting men, long after the frame it dwelt in has become dust, and when both name and memory are forgotten.
We know not who among the Dead control our destinies. The universal human race is linked and bound
together by those influences and sympathies, which in the truest sense do make men's fates. Humanity is the unit, of which the man is but a fraction. What other men in the Past have done, said, thought,
makes the great iron network of circumstance that environs and controls us all. We take our faith on trust. We think and believe as the Old Lords of Thought command us; and Reason is powerless before
Authority.
We would make or annul a particular contract; but the Thoughts of the dead Judges of England, living when their ashes have been cold for centuries, stand between us and that which we would do, and
utterly forbid it. We would settle our estate in a particular way; but the prohibition of the English Parliament, its uttered Thought when the first or second Edward reigned, comes echoing down the long
avenues of time, and tells us we shall not exercise the power of disposition as we wish. We would gain a particular advantage of another; and the thought of the old Roman lawyer who died before Justinian, or
that of Rome's great orator Cicero, annihilates the act, or makes the intention ineffectual. This act, Moses forbids;that, Alfred. We would sell our land; but certain marks on a perishable paper tell us that
our father or remote ancestor ordered otherwise; and the arm of the dead, emerging from the grave, with peremptory gesture prohibits the alienation. About to sin or err, the thought or wish of our dead
mother, told us when we were children, by words that died upon the air in the utterance, and many a long year were forgotten, flashes on our memory, and holds us back with a power that is resistless.
Thus we obey the dead and thus shall the living, when we are dead, for weal or woe, obey us. The
Thoughts of the Past are the Laws of the Present and the Future. That which we say and do, if its effects last not beyond our lives, is unimportant. That which shall live when we are dead, as part of the great
body of law enacted by the dead, is the only act worth doing, the only Thought worth speaking. The desire to do something that shall benefit the world, when neither praise nor obloquy will reach us where
we sleep soundly in the grave, is the noblest ambition entertained by man.
It is the ambition of a true and genuine Mason. Knowing the slow processes by which the Deity brings about great results, he does not expect to reap as well as sow, in a single lifetime. It is the inflexible fate
and noblest destiny, with rare exceptions, of the great and good, to work, and let others reap the harvest of their labors. He who does good, only to be repaid in kind, or in thanks and gratitude, or in reputation
and the world's praise, is like him who loans his money, that he may, after certain months, receive it

back with interest. To be repaid for eminent services with slander, obloquy, or ridicule, or at best with stupid indifference or cold ingratitude, as it is common, so it is no misfortune, except to those who lack
the wit to see or sense to appreciate the service, or the nobility of soul to thank and reward with eulogy, the benefactor of his kind. His influences live, and the great Future will obey; whether it recognize or
disown the lawgiver.
Miltiades was fortunate that he was exiled; and Aristides that he was ostracized, because men wearied of hearing him called "The Just." Not the Redeemer was unfortunate; but those only who repaid Him
for the inestimable gift He offered them, and for a life passed in toiling for their good, by nailing Him upon the cross, as though He had been a slave or malefactor. The persecutor dies and rots, and
Posterity utters his name with execration: but his victim's memory he has unintentionally made glorious and immortal.
If not for slander and persecution, the Mason who would benefit his race must look for apathy and cold
indifference in those whose good he seeks, in those who ought to seek the good of others. Except when the sluggish depths of the Human Mind are broken up and tossed as with a storm, when at the
appointed time a great Reformer comes, and a new Faith springs up and grows with supernatural energy, the progress of Truth is slower than the growth of oaks and he who plants need not expect to
gather. The Redeemer, at His death, had twelve disciples and one betrayed and one deserted and denied Him. It is enough for us to know that the fruit will come in its due season. When, or who shall gather
it, it does not in the least concern us to know. It is our business to plant the seed. It is God's right to give the fruit to whom He pleases; and if not to us, then is our action by so much the more noble.
To sow, that others may reap; to work and plant for those who are to occupy the earth when we are
dead; to project our influences far into the future, and live beyond our time; to rule as the Kings of Thought, over men who are yet unborn; to bless with the glorious gifts of Truth and Light and Liberty
those who will neither know the name of the giver, nor care in what grave his unregarded ashes repose, is the true office of a Mason and the proudest destiny of a man.
All the great and beneficent operations of Nature are produced by slow and often imperceptible
degrees. The work of destruction and devastation only is violent and rapid. The Volcano and the Earthquake, the Tornado and the Avalanche, leap suddenly into full life and fearful energy, and smite
with an unexpected blow. Vesuvius buried Pompeii and Herculaneum in a night; and Lisbon fell prostrate before God in a breath, when the earth rocked and shuddered; the Alpine village vanishes and
is erased at one bound of the avalanche; and the ancient forests fall like grass be fore the mower, when the tornado leaps upon them. Pestilence slays its thousands in a day; and the storm in a night strews the
sand with shattered navies.

The Gourd of the Prophet Jonah grew up, and was withered, in a night. But many years ago, before the Norman Conqueror stamped his mailed foot on the neck of prostrate Saxon England, some wandering
barbarian, of the continent then unknown to the world, in mere idleness, with hand or foot, covered an acorn with a little earth, and passed on regardless, on his journey to the dim Past. He died and was
forgotten; but the acorn lay there still, the mighty force within it acting in the darkness. A tender shoot stole gently up; and fed by the light and air and frequent dews, put forth its little leaves, and lived,
because the elk or buffalo chanced not to place his foot upon and crush it. The years marched onward, and the shoot became a sapling, and its green leaves went and came with Spring and Autumn. And still
the years came and passed away again, and William, the Norman Bastard, parcelled England out among his Barons, and still the sapling grew, and the dews fed its leaves, and the birds builded their nests
among its small limbs for many generations. And still the years came and went, and the Indian hunter slept in the shade of the sapling, and Richard LionHeart fought at Acre and Ascalon, and John's bold
Barons wrested from him the Great Charter; and the sapling had become a tree; and still it grew, and thrust its great arms wider abroad, and lifted its head still higher toward the Heavens; strongrooted, and
defiant of the storms that roared and eddied through its branches; and when Columbus ploughed with his keels the unknown Western Atlantic, and Cortez and Pizarro bathed the cross in blood; and the
Puritan, the Huguenot, the Cavalier, and the follower of Penn sought a refuge and a resting place beyond the ocean, the Great Oak still stood, firmrooted, vigorous, stately, haughtily domineering over
all the forest, heed less of all the centuries that had hurried past since the wild Indian planted the little acorn in the forest; a stout and hale old tree, with wide circumference shading many a rood of ground
and fit to furnish timbers for a ship, to carry the thunders of the Great Republic's guns around the world. And yet, if one had sat and watched it every instant, from the moment when the feeble shoot
first pushed its way to the light until the eagles built among its branches, he would never have seen the tree or sapling grow.
Many long centuries ago, before the Chaldaean Shepherds watched the Stars, or Shufu built the
Pyramids, one could have sailed in a seventyfour where now a thousand islands gem the surface of the Indian Ocean; and the deepsea lead would nowhere have found any bottom. But below these waves
were myriads upon myriads, beyond the power of Arithmetic to number, of minute existences, each a perfect living creature, made by the Al mighty Creator, and fashioned by Him for the work it had to do
There they toiled beneath the waters, each doing its allotted work, and wholly ignorant of the result which God intended. They lived and died, incalculable in numbers and almost infinite in the
succession of their generations, each adding his mite to the gigantic work that went on there under God's direction. Thus hath He chosen to create great Continents and Islands; and still the coral insects
live and work, as when they made the rocks that underlie the valley of the Ohio.
Thus God hath chosen to create. Where now is firm land, once chafed and thundered the great primeval ocean. For ages upon ages the minute shields of infinite myriads of infusoria, and the stony stems of
encrinites sunk into its depths, and there, under the vast pressure of its waters, hardened into limestone. Raised slowly from the Profound by His hand, its quarries underlie the soil of all the continents,
hundreds of feet in thickness; and we, of these remains of the countless dead, build tombs and palaces,

as the Egyptians, whom we call ancient, built their pyramids.
On all the broad lakes and oceans the Great Sun looks earnestly and lovingly, and the invisible vapors rise ever up to meet him. No eye but God's beholds them as they rise. There, in the upper atmospere,
they are condensed to mist, and gather into clouds, and float and swim around in the ambient air. They sail with its currents, and hover over the ocean, and roll in huge masses round the stony shoulders of
great mountains. Condensed still more by change of temperature, they drop upon the thirsty earth in gentle showers, or pour upon it in heavy rains, or storm against its bosom at the angry Equinoctial. The
shower, the rain, and the storm pass away, the clouds vanish, and the bright stars again shine clearly upon the glad earth. The raindrops sink into the ground, and gather in subterranean reservoirs, and run
in subterranean channels, and bubble up in springs and fountains; and from the mountainsides and heads of valleys the silver threads of water begin their long journey to the ocean. Uniting, they widen
into brooks and rivulets, then into streams and rivers; and, at last, a Nile, Ganges, a Danube, an Amazon, or a Mississippi rolls between its banks, mighty, majestic, and resistless, creating vast alluvial
valleys to be the granaries of the world, ploughed by the thousand keels of commerce and serving as great highways, and as the impassable boundaries of rival nations; ever returning to the ocean the drops
that rose from it in vapor, and descended in rain and snow and hail upon the level plains and lofty mountains; and causing him to recoil for many a mile before the long rush of their great tide.
So it is with the aggregate of Human endeavor. As the invisible particles of vapor combine and
coalesce to form the mists and clouds that fall in rain on thirsty continents, and bless the great green forests and wide grassy prairies, the waving meadows and the fields by which men live; as the infinite
myriads of drops that the glad earth drinks are gathered into springs and rivulets and rivers, to aid in levelling the mountains and elevating the plains, and to feed the large lakes and
restless oceans; so all Human Thought, and Speech and Action, all that is done and said and thought and suffered upon the Earth combine together, and flow onward in one broad resistless current toward
those great results to which they are determined by the will of God.
We build slowly and destroy swiftly. Our Ancient Brethren who built the Temples at Jerusalem, with many myriad blows felled, hewed, and squared the cedars, and quarried the stones, and carved the
intricate ornaments, which were to be the Temples. Stone after stone, by the combined effort and long toil of Apprentice, FellowCraft, and Master, the walls arose; slowly the roof was framed and fashioned;
and many years elapsed before, at length, the Houses stood finished, all fit and ready for the Worship of God, gorgeous in the sunny splendors of the atmosphere of Palestine. So they were built. A single
motion of the arm of a rude, barbarous Assyrian Spearman, or drunken Roman or Gothic Legionary of Titus, moved by a senseless impulse of the brutal will, flung in the blazing brand; and, with no further
human agency, a few short hours sufficed to consume and melt each Temple to a smoking mass of black unsightly ruin.

Be patient, therefore, my Brother, and wait! The issues are with God: To do, Of right belongs to us.
Therefore faint not, nor be weary in welldoing! Be not discouraged at men's apathy, nor disgusted with their follies, nor tired of their indifference! Care not for returns and results;but see only what there is to
do, and do it, leaving the results to God! Soldier of the Cross! Sworn Knight of Justice, Truth, and Toleration! Good Knight and True! be patient and work!
The Apocalypse, that sublime Kabalistic and prophetic Summary of all the occult figures, divides its
images into three Septenaries, after each of which there is silence in Heaven. There are Seven Seals to be opened, that is to say, Seven mysteries to know, and Seven difficulties to overcome, Seven trumpets
to sound, and Seven cups to empty.
The Apocalypse is, to those who receive the nineteenth Degree, the Apothesis of that Sublime Faith which aspires to God alone, and despises all the pomps and works of Lucifer. LUCIFER, the Light
bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual or
selfish Souls? Doubt it not! for traditions are full of Divine Revelations and Inspirations: and Inspiration is not of one Age nor of one Creed. Plato and Philo, also, were inspired.
The Apocalypse, indeed, is a book as obscure as the Sohar.
It is written hieroglyphically with numbers and images and the Apostle often appeals to the intelligence
of the Initiated. "Let him who hath knowledge, understand! let him who understands, calculate!" he often says, after an allegory or the mention of a number. Saint John, the favorite Apostle, and the
Depositary of all the Secrets of the Saviour, therefore did not write to be undertood by the multitude.
The Sephar Yezirah, the Sohar, and the Apocalypse are the completest embodiments of Occultism. They contain more meanings than words; their expressions are figurative as poetry and exact as
numbers. The Apocalypse sums up, completes, and surpasses all the Science of Abraham and of Solomon. The visions of Ezekiel, by the river Chebar, and of the new Symbolic Temple, are equally
mysterious expressions, veiled by figures of the enigmatic dogmas of the Kabalah, and their symbols are as little understood by the Commentators, as those of Free Masonry.
The Septenary is the Crown of the Numbers, because it unites the Triangle of the Idea to the Square of
the Form.

The more the great Hierophants were at pains to conceal their absolute Science, the more they sought to add grandeur to and multiply its symbols. The huge pyramids, with their triangular sides of elevation
and square bases, represented their Metaphysics, founded upon the knowledge of Nature. That knowledge of Na ture had for its symbolic key the gigantic form of that huge Sphinx, which has
hollowed its deep bed in the sand, while keeping watch at the feet of the Pyramids. The Seven grand monuments called the Wonders of the World, were the magnificent Commentaries on the Seven lines
that composed the Pyramids, and on the Seven mystic gates of Thebes.
The Septenary philosophy of Initiation among the Ancients may be summed up thus:
Three Absolute Principles which are but One Principle: four elementary forms which are but one; all forming a Single Whole, compounded of the Idea and the Form.
The three Principles were these:
1. BEING IS BEING.
In Philosophy, identity of the Idea and of Being or Verity; in Religion, the first Principle, THE
FATHER.
2. BEING IS REAL.
In Philosophy, identity of Knowing and of Being or Reality; in Religion, the LOGOS of Plato, the
Demiourgos, the WORD.
3. BEING IS LOGIC.
In Philosophy, identity of the Reason and Reality; in Religion, Providence, the Divine Action that
makes real the Good, that which in Christianity we call THE HOLY SPIRIT.
The union of all the Seven colors is the White, the analogous symbol of the GOOD: the absence of all is the Black, the analogous symbol of the EVIL. There are three primary colors, Red, Yellow, and Blue;
and four secondary, Orange, Green, Indigo, and Violet; and all these God displays to man in the rainbow; and they have their analogies also in the moral and intellectual world. The same number,
Seven, continually reappears in the Apocalypse, compounded of three and four; and these numbers relate to the last Seven of the Sephiroth, three answering to BENIGNITY or MERCY, SEVERITY or
JUSTICE, and BEAUTY or HARMONY; and four to Netzach, Hod, Yesod, and Malakoth, VICTORY, GLORY, STABILITY, and DOMINATION. The same numbers also represent the first three Sephiroth,
KETNER, KHOKMAH, and BAINAH, or Will, Wisdom, and Understanding, which, with DAATH or Intellection or Thought, are also four, DAATH not being regarded as a Sephirah, not as the Deity

248/641
acting, or as a potency, energy, or attribute, but as the Divine Action.
The Sephiroth are commonly figured in the Kabalah as constituting a human form, the ADAM, KADMON Or MACROCOSM. Thus arranged, the universal law of Equipoise is three times
exernplified. From that of the Divine Intellectual, Active, Masculine ENERGY, and the Passive CAPACITY to produce Thought, the action of THINKING results. From that of BENIGNITY and
SEVERITY, HARMONY flows; and from that of VICTORY or an Infinite overcoming, and GLORY, which, being Infinite, would seem to forbid the existence of obstacles or opposition, results
STABILITY or PERMANENCE, which is the perfect DOMINION Of the Infinite WILL.
The last nine Sephiroth are included in, at the same time that they have flowed forth from, the first of all, KETHER, or the CROWN. Each also, in succession flowed from, and yet still remains included in,
the one preceding it. The Will of God includes His Wisdom, and His Wisdom is His Will specially developed and acting. This Wisdom is the LOGOS that creates, mistaken and personified by Simon
Magus and the succeeding Gnostics. By means of its utterance, the letter YOD, it creates the worlds, first in the Divine Intellect as an Idea, which invested with form became the fabricated World, the
Universe of material reality. YOD and HE, two letters of the Ineffable Name of the Manifested Deity, represent the Male and the Female, the Active and the Passive in Equilibrium, and the VAV completes
the Trinity and the Triliteral Name, the Divine Triangle, which with the repetion of the He becomes the Tetragrammaton.
Thus the ten Sephiroth contain all the Sacred Numbers, three, five, seven, and nine, and the perfect
Number Ten and correspond with the Tetractys of Pythagoras.
BEING IS BEING, Ahayah Asar Ahayah. This is the principle, the "BEGINNING."
In the Beginning was, that is to say, IS, WAS, and WILL BE, the WORD, that is to say, the REASON that Speaks.
The Word is the reason of belief, and in it also is the expression of the Faith which makes Science a
living thing. The Word, is the Source of Logic. Jesus is the Word Incarnate. The accord of the Reason with Faith, of Knowledge with Belief, of Authority with Liberty, has become in modern times the
veritable enigma of the Sphinx.
It is WISDOM that, in the Kabalistic Books of the Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus, is the Creative Agent of God. Elsewhere in the Hebrew writings it is Debar Iahavah, the Word of God.

It is by His uttered Word that God reveals Himself to us; alone in the visible and invisible but
intellectual creation, but in our convictions, consciousness, and instincts. Hence it is that! certain beliefs are universal. The conviction of all men that God is good led to a belief in a Devil, the fallen
Lucifer or Lightbearer, Shaitan the Adversary, Ahriman and Tuphon, as an at tempt to explain the existence of Evil, and make it consistent with the Infinite Power, Wisdom, and Benevolence of God.
Nothing surpasses and nothing equals, as a Summary of all the doctrines of the Old World, those brief
words engraven by HERMES on a Stone, and known under the name of "The Tablet of Emerald:" the Unity of Being and the Unity of the Harmonies, ascending and descending, the progressive and
proportional scale of the Word; the immutable law of the Equilibrium, and the proportioned progress of the universal analogies; the relation of the Idea to the Word, giving the measure of the relation between
the Creator and the Created, the necessary mathematics of the Infinite, proved by the measures of a single corner of the Finite; all this is expressed by this single proposition of the Great Egyptian
Hierophant:
"What is Superior is as that which is Inferior, and what is Below is as that which is Above, to form the Marvels of the Unity."
XX. GRAND MASTER OF ALL SYMBOLIC LODGES.
The true Mason is a practical Philosopher, who, under religious emblems, in all ages adopted by
wisdom, builds upon plans traced by nature and reason the moral edifice of knowledge. He ought to find, in the symmetrical relation of all the parts of this rational edifice, the principle and rule of all his
duties, the source of all his pleasures. He improves his moral nature, becomes a better man, and finds in the reunion of virtuous men, assembled with pure views, the means of multiplying his acts of
beneficence. Masonry and Philosophy, without being one and the same thing, have the same object, and propose to themselves the same end, the worship of the Grand Architect of the Universe, acquaintance
and familiarity with the wonders of nature, and the happiness of humanity attained by the constant practice of all the virtues.
As Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodges, it is your especial duty to aid in restoring Masonry to its
primitive purity. You have become an instructor. Masonry long wandered in error. Instead of improving, it degenerated from its primitive simplicity, and retrograded toward a system, distorted by
stupidity and ignorance, which, unable to construct a beautiful machine, made a complicated one. Less than two hundred years ago, its organization was simple, and altogether moral, its emblems, allegories,
and ceremonies easy to be understood, and their purpose and object readily to be seen. It was then confined to a very small number of Degrees. Its constitutions were like those of a Society of Essenes,

written in the first century of our era. There could be seen the primitive Christianity, organized into Masonry, the school of Pythagoras without incongruities or absurdities; a Masonry simple and
significant, in which it was not necessary to torture the mind to discover reasonable interpretations; a Masonry at once religious and philosophical, worthy of a good citizen and an enlightened
philanthropist.
Innovators and inventors overturned that primitive simplicity. Ignorance engaged in the work of making Degrees, and trifles and gewgaws and pretended mysteries, absurd or hideous, usurped the place of
Masonic Truth. The picture of a horrid vengeance, the poniard and the bloody head, appeared in the peaceful Temple of Masonry, without sufficient explanation of their symbolic meaning. Oaths out of all
proportion with their object, shocked the candidate, and then became ridiculous, and were wholly disregarded. Acolytes were exposed to tests, and compelled to perform acts, which, if real, would have
been abominable; but being mere chimeras, were preposterous, and excited contempt and laughter only. Eight hundred Degrees of one kind and another were invented: Infidelity and even Jesuitry were taught
under the mask of Masonry. The rituals even of the respectable Degrees, copied and mutilated by ignorant men, became nonsensical and trivial; and the words so corrupted that it has hitherto been
found impossible to recover many of them at all. Candidates were made to degrade themselves, and to submit to insults not tolerable to a man of spirit and honor.
Hence it was that, practically, the largest portion of the Degrees claimed by the Ancient and Accepted
Scottish Rite, and before it by the Rite of Perfection, fell into disuse, were merely communicated, and their rituals became jejune and insignificant. These Rites resembled those old palaces and baronial
castles, the different parts of which, built at different periods remote from one another, upon plans and according to tastes that greatly varied, formed a discordant and incongruous whole. Judaism and
chivalry, superstition and philosophy, philanthropy and insane hatred and longing for vengeance, a pure morality and unjust and illegal revenge, were found strangely mated and standing hand in hand within
the Temples of Peace and Concord; and the whole system was one grotesque commingling of incongruous things, of contrasts and contradictions, of shocking and fantastic extravagances, of parts
repugnant to good taste, and fine conceptions overlaid and disfigured by absurdities engendered by ignorance, fanaticism, and a senseless mysticism.
An empty and sterile pomp, impossible indeed to be carried out, and to which no meaning whatever
was attached, with farfetched explanations that were either so many stupid platitudes or themselves needed an interpreter; lofty titles, arbitrarily assumed, and to which the inventors had not condescended
to attach any explanation that should acquit them of the folly of assuming temporal rank, power, and titles of nobility, made the world laugh, and the Initiate feel ashamed.
Some of these titles we retain; but they have with us meanings entirely consistent with that Spirit of
Equality which is the foundation and peremptory law of its being of all Masonry. The Knight, with us,

is he who devotes his hand, his heart, his brain, to the Science of Masonry, and professes himself the Sworn Soldier of Truth: the Prince is he who aims to be Chief [Princeps], first, leader, among his
equals, in virtue and good deeds: the Sovereign is he who, one of an order whose members are all Sovereigns, is Supreme only because the law and constitutions are so, which he administers, and by
which he, like every other brother, is governed. The titles, Puissant, Potent, Wise, and Venerable, indicate that power of Virtue, Intelligence, and Wisdom, which those ought to strive to attain who are
placed in high office by the suffrages of their brethren: and all our other titles and designations have an esoteric meaning, consistent with modesty and equality, and which those who receive them should fully
understand. As Master of a Lodge it is your duty to instruct your Brethren that they are all so many constant lessons, teaching the lofty qualifications which are required of those who claim them, and not
merely idle gewgaws worn in ridiculous imitation of the times when the Nobles and Priests were masters and the people slaves: and that, in all true Masonry, the Knight, the Pontiff, the Prince, and the
Sovereign are but the first among their equals: and the cordon, the clothing, and the jewel but symbols and emblems of the virtues required of all good Masons.
The Mason kneels, no longer to present his petition for admittance or to receive the answer, no longer to
a man as his superior, who is but his brother, but to his God; to whom he appeals for the rectitude of his intentions, and whose aid he asks to enable him to keep his vows. No one is degraded by bending his
knee to God at the altar, or to receive the honor of Knighthood as Bayard and Du Guesclin knelt. To kneel for other purposes, Masonry does not require. God gave to man a head to be borne erect, a port
upright and majestic. We assemble in our Temples to cherish and inculcate sentiments that conform to that loftiness of bearing which the just and upright man is entitled to maintain, and we do not require
those who desire to be admitted among us, ignominiously to bow the head. We respect man, because we respect ourselves that he may conceive a lofty idea of his dignity as a human being free and
independent. If modesty is a virtue, humility and obsequiousness to man are base: for there is a noble pride which is the most real and solid basis of virtue. Man should humble himself before the Infinite
God; but not before his erring and imperfect brother.
As Master of a Lodge, you will therefore be exceedingly careful that no Candidate, in any Degree, be required to submit to any degradation whatever; as has been too much the custom in some of the
Degrees and take it as a certain and inflexible rule, to which there is no exception, that real Masonry requires of no man anything to which a Knight and Gentleman cannot honorably, and without feeling
outraged or humiliated submit.
The Supreme Council for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States at length undertook the indispensable and long delayed task of revising and reforming the work and rituals of the Thirty
Degrees under its jurisdiction. Retaining the essentials of the Degrees and all the means by which the members recognize one another, it has sought out and developed the leading idea of each Degree,
rejected the puerilities and absurdities with which many of them were disfigured, and made of them a connected system of moral, religious, and philosophical instruction. Sectarian of no creed, it has yet

thought it not improper to use the old allegories, based on occurrences detailed in the Hebrew and Christian books, and drawn from the Ancient Mysteries of Egypt, Persia, Greece, India, the Druids and
the Essenes, as vehicles to communicate the Great Masonic Truths; as it has used the legends of the Crusades, and the ceremonies of the orders of Knighthood.
It no longer inculcates a criminal and wicked vengeance. It has not allowed Masonry to play the
assassin: to avenge the death either of Hiram, of Charles the 1st, or of Jaques De Molay and the Templars. The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Masonry has now become, what Masonry at first
was meant to be, a Teacher of Great Truths, inspired by an upright and enlightened reason, a firm and constant wisdom, and an affectionate and liberal philanthropy.
It is no longer a system, over the composition and arrangement of the different parts of which, want of
reflection, chance, ignorance, and perhaps motives still more ignoble presided; a system unsuited to our habits, our manners, our ideas, or the worldwide philanthropy and universal toleration of Masonry; or
to bodies small in number, whose revenues should be devoted to the relief of the unfortunate, and not to empty show; no longer a hetero geneous aggregate of Degrees, shocking by its anachronisms and
contradictions, powerless to disseminate light, information, and moral and philosophical ideas.
As Master, you will teach those who are under you, and to whom you will owe your office, that the decorations of many of the Degrees are to be dispensed with, whenever the expense would interfere
with the duties of charity, relief, and benevolence; and to be indulged in only by wealthy bodies that will thereby do no wrong to those entitled to their assistance. The essentials of all the Degrees may be
procured at slight expense; and it is at the option of every Brother to procure or not to procure, as he pleases, the dress, decorations, and jewels of any Degree other than the 14th, 18th, 30th, and 32d.
We teach the truth of none of the legends we recite. They are to us but parables and allegories,
involving and enveloping Masonic instruction and vehicles of useful and interesting information. They represent the different phases of the human mind, its efforts and struggles to comprehend nature, God,
the government of the Universe, the permitted existence of sorrow and evil. To teach us wisdom, and the folly of endeavoring to explain to ourselves that which we are not capable of understanding, we
reproduce the speculations of the Philosophers, the Kabalists, the Mystagogues and the Gnostics. Every one being at liberty to apply our symbols and emblems as he thinks most consistent with truth
and reason and with his own faith, we give them such an interpretation only as may be accepted by all. Our Degrees may be conferred in France or Turkey, at Pekin, Ispahan, Rome, or Geneva, in the city of
Penn or in Catholic Louisiana, upon the subject of an absolute government or the citizen of a Free State, upon Sectarian or Theist. To honor the Deity, to regard all men as our Brethren, as children,
equally dear to Him, of the Supreme Creator of the Universe, and to make himself useful to society and himself by his labor, are its teachings to its Initiates in all the Degrees.

Preacher of Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality, it desires them to be attained by making men fit to receive them, and by the moral power of an intelligent and enlightened People. It lays no plots and
conspiracies. It hatches no premature revolutions; it encourages no people to revolt against the constituted authorities; but recognizing the great truth that freedom follows fitness for freedom as the
corollary follows the axiom, it strives to prepare men to govern themselves.
Where domestic slavery exists, it teaches the master humanity and the alleviation of the condition of his slave, and moderate correction and gentle discipline; as it teaches them to the master of the apprentice:
and as it teaches to the employers of other men, in mines, manufactories, and workshops, consideration and humanity for those who depend upon their labor for their bread, and to whom want of employment
is starvation, and overwork is fever, consumption, and death.
As Master of a Lodge, you are to inculcate these duties on your brethren. Teach the employed to be honest, punctual, and faithful as well as respectful and obedient to all proper orders: but also teach the
employer that every man or woman who desires to work, has a right to have work to do and that they, and those who from sickness or feebleness, loss of limb or of bodily vigor, old age or infancy, are not
able to work, have a right to be fed, clothed, and sheltered from the inclement elements: that he commits an awful sin against Masonry and in the sight of God, if he closes his work shops or factories,
or ceases to work his mines, when they do not yield him what he regards as sufficient profit, and so dismisses his workmen and workwomen to starve; or when he reduces the wages of man or woman to
so low a standard that they and their families cannot be clothed and fed and comfortably housed; or by overwork must give him their blood and life in exchange for the pittance of their wages: and that his
duty as a Mason and Brother peremptorily requires him to continue to employ those who else will be pinched with hunger and cold, or resort to theft and vice: and to pay them fair wages, though it may
reduce or annul his profits or even eat into his capital; for God hath but loaned him his wealth, and made him His almoner and agent to invest it.
Except as mere symbols of the moral virtues and intellectual qualities, the tools and implements of
Masonry belong exclusively to the first three Degrees. They also, however, serve to remind the Mason who has advanced further, that his new rank is based upon the humble labors of the symbolic Degrees,
as they are improperly termed, inasmuch as all the Degrees are symbolic.
Thus the Initiates are inspired with a just idea of Masonry, to wit, that it is essentially WORK; both teaching and practising LABOR; and that it is altogether emblematic. Three kinds of work are
necessary to the preservation and protection of man and society: manual labor, specially belonging to the three blue Degrees; labor in arms, symbolized by the Knightly or chivalric Degrees; and intellectual
labor, belonging particularly to the Philosophical Degrees.

We have preserved and multiplied such emblems as have a true and profound meaning. We reject many of the old and senseless explanations. We have not reduced Masonry to a cold metaphysics that exiles
everything belonging to the domain of the imagination. The ignorant, and those halfwise in reality, but overwise in their own conceit, may assail our symbols with sarcasms; but they are nevertheless
ingenious veils that cover the Truth, respected by all who know the means by which the heart of man is reached and his feelings enlisted. The Great Moralists often had recourse to allegories, in order to
instruct men without repelling them. But we have been careful not to allow our emblems to be too obscure, so as to require farfetched and forced interpretations. In our days, and in the enlightened land
in which we live, we do not need to wrap ourselves in veils so strange and impenetrable, as to prevent or hinder instruction instead of furthering it; or to induce the suspicion that we have concealed meanings
which we communicate only to the most reliable adepts, because they are contrary to good order or the wellbeing of society.
The Duties of the Class of Instructors, that is, the Masons of the Degrees from the 4th to the 8th,
inclusive, are, particularly, to perfect the younger Masons in the words, signs and tokens and other work of the Degrees they have received; to explain to them the meaning of the different emblems, and to
expound the moral instruction which they convey. And upon their report of proficiency alone can their pupils be allowed to advance and receive an increase of wages.
The Directors of the Work, or those of the 9th, l0th, and 11th Degrees are to report to the Chapters upon
the regularity, activity and proper direction of the work of bodies in the lower Degrees, and what is needed to be enacted for their prosperity and usefulness. In the Symbolic Lodges, they are particularly
charged to stimulate the zeal of the workmen, to induce them to engage in new labors and enterprises for the good of Masonry, their country and mankind, and to give them fraternal advice when they fall
short of their duty; or, in cases that require it, to invoke against them the rigor of Masonic law.
The Architects or those of the 12th, 13th, and 14th, should be selected from none but Brothers well instructed in the preceding Degrees; zealous, and capable of discoursing upon that Masonry;
illustrating it, and discussing the simple questions of moral philosophy. And one of them, at every communication, should be prepared with a lecture, communicating useful knowledge or giving good
advice to the Brethren.
The Knights, of the 15th and 16th Degrees, wear the sword. They are bound to prevent and repair, as far as may be in their power, all injustice, both in the world and in Masonry; to protect the weak and to
bring oppressors to justice. Their works and lectures must be in this spirit. They should inquire whether Masonry fulfills, as far as it ought and can, its principal purpose, which is to succor the unfortunate.
That it may do so, they should prepare propositions to be offered in the Blue Lodges calculated to attain that end, to put an end to abuses, and to prevent or correct negligence. Those in the Lodges who have
attained the rank of Knights, are most fit to be appointed Almoners, and charged to ascertain and make

known who need and are entitled to the charity of the Order.
In the higher Degrees those only should be received who have sufficient reading and information to discuss the great questions of philosophy. From them the Orators of the Lodges should be selected, as
well as those of the Councils and Chapters. They are charged to suggest such measures as are necessary to make Masonry entirely faithful to the spirit of its institution, both as to its charitable purposes, and
the diffusion of light and knowledge; such as are needed to correct abuses that have crept in, and offences against the rules and general spirit of the Order; and such as will tend to make it, as it was
meant to be, the great Teacher of Mankind.
As Master of a Lodge, Council, or Chapter, it will be your duty to impress upon the minds of your Brethren these views of the general plan and separate parts of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite;
of its spirit and design; its harmony and regularity; of the duties of the officers and members;and of the particular lessons intended to be taught by each Degree.
Especially you are not to allow any assembly of the body over which you may preside, to close, without
recalling to the minds of the Brethren the Masonic virtues and duties which are represented upon the Tracing Board of this Degree. That is an imperative duty. Forget not that, more than three thousand
years ago, ZOROASTER said: "Be good, be kind, be humane, and charitable; love your fellows; console the afflicted; pardon those who have done you wrong." Nor that more than two thousand three
hundred years ago CONFUCIUS repeated, also quoting the language of those who had lived before himself: "Love thy neighbor as thyself: Do not to others what thou wouldst not wish should be done to
thyself: Forgive injuries. Forgive your enemy, be reconciled to him, give him assistance, invoke God in his behalf!"
Let not the morality of your Lodge be inferior to that of the Persian or the Chinese Philosopher. Urge
upon your Brethren the teaching and the unostentatious practice of the morality of the Lodge, without regard to times, places, religions, or peoples.
Urge them to love one another, to be devoted to one another, to be faithful to the country, the
government, and the laws: for to serve the country is to pay a dear and sacred debt: To respect all forms of worship, to tolerate all political and religious opinions; not to blame, and still less to condemn the
religion of others: not to seek to make converts; but to be content if they have the religion of Socrates; a veneration for the Creator, the religion of good works, and grateful acknowledgment of God's blessings:
To fraternize with all men; to assist all who are unfortunate; and to cheerfully postpone their own interests to that of the Order:
To make it the constant rule of their lives, to think well, to speak well, and to act well:

256/641
To place the sage above the soldier, the noble, or the prince: and take the wise and good as their models:
To see that their professions and practice, their teachings and conduct, do always agree:
To make this also their motto: Do that which thou oughtest to do; let the result be what it will.
Such, my Brother, are some of the duties of that office which you have sought to be qualified to
exercise. May you perform them well; and in so doing gain honor for yourself, and advance the great cause of Masonry, Humanity, and Progress.
XXI. NOACHITE OR PRUSSIAN KNIGHT
You are especially charged in this Degree to be modest and humble, and not vainglorious nor filled with selfconceit. Be not wiser in your own opinion than the Deity, nor find fault with His works, nor
endeavor to improve upon what He has done. Be modest also in your intercourse with your fellows, and slow to entertain evil thoughts of them and reluctant to ascribe to them evil intentions. A thousand
presses, flooding the country with their evanescent leaves, are busily and incessantly engaged in maligning the motives and conduct of men and parties, and in making one man think worse of another;
while, alas, scarcely one is found that ever, even accidentally, labors to make man think better of his fellow.
Slander and calumny were never so insolently licentious in any country as they are this day in ours. The
most retiring disposition, the most unobtrusive demeanor, is no shield against their poisoned arrows. The most eminent public service only makes their vituperation and invective more eager and more
unscrupulous, when he who has done such service presents himself as a candidate for the people's suffrages.
The evil is widespread and universal. No man, no woman, no household, is sacred or safe from this new
Inquisition. No act is so pure or so praiseworthy, that the unscrupulous vender of lies who lives by pandering to a corrupt and morbid public appetite will not proclaim it as a crime. No motive is so
innocent or so laudable, that he will not hold it up as villainy. Journalism pries into the interior of private houses, gloats over the details of domestic tragedies of sin and shame, and deliberately invents
and industriously circulates the most unmitigated and baseless falsehoods, to coin money for those who pursue it as a trade, or to effect a temporary result in the wars of faction.
We need not enlarge upon these evils. They are apparent to all and lamented over by all, and it is the

257/641
duty of a Mason to do all in his power to lessen, if not to remove them. With the errors and even sins of other men, that do not personally affect us or ours, and need not our condemnation to be odious, we
have nothing to do and the journalist has no patent that makes him the Censor of Morals. There is no obligation resting on us to trumpet forth our disapproval of every wrongful or injudicious or improper
act that every other man commits. One would be ashamed to stand on the street corners and retail them orally for pennies.
One ought, in truth, to write, or speak against no other one in this world. Each man in it has enough to
do, to watch and keep guard over himself. Each of us is sick enough in this great Lazaretto: and journalism and polemical writing constantly remind us of a scene once witnessed in a little hospital;
where it was horrible to hear how the patients mockingly reproached each other with their disorders and infirmities: how one, who was wasted by consumption, jeered at another who was bloated by dropsy:
how one laughed at another's cancer of the face; and this one again at his neighbor's lockjaw or squint; until at last the delirious feverpatient sprang out of his bed, and tore away the coverings from the
wounded bodies of his companions, and nothing was to be seen but hideous misery and mutilation. Such is the revolting work in which journalism and political partisanship, and half the world outside of
Masonry, are engaged.
Very generally, the censure bestowed upon men's acts, by those who have appointed and commissioned themselves Keepers of the Public Morals, is undeserved. Often it is not only undeserved, but praise is
deserved instead of censure, and, when the latter is not undeserved, it is always extravagant, and therefore unjust.
A Mason will wonder what spirit they are endowed withal, that can basely libel at a man, even, that is
fallen. If they had any nobility of soul, they would with him condole his disasters, and drop some tears in pity of his folly and wretchedness and if they were merely human and not brutal, Nature did grievous
wrong to human bodies, to curse them with souls so cruel as to strive to add to a wretchedness already intolerable. When a Mason hears of any man that hath fallen into public disgrace, he should have a
mind to commiserate his mishap, and not to make him more disconsolate. To envenom a name by libels, that already is openly tainted, is to add stripes with an iron rod to one that is flayed with
whipping; and to every welltempered mind will seem most inhuman and unmanly.
Even the man who does wrong and commits errors often has a quiet home, a fireside of his own, a gentle, loving wife and innocent children, who perhaps do not know of his past errors and lapses past
and long repented of or if they do, they love him the better, because, being mortal, he hath erred, and being in the image of God, he hath repented. That every blow at this husband and father lacerates the
pure and tender bosoms of that wife and those daughters, is a consideration that doth not stay the hand of the brutal journalist and partisan: but he strikes home at these shrinking, quivering, innocent, tender
bosoms; and then goes out upon the great arteries of cities, where the current of life pulsates, and holds

258/641
his head erect, and calls on his fellows to laud him and admire him, for the chivalric act he hath done, in striking his dagger through one heart into another tender and trusting one.
If you seek for high and strained carriages, you shall, for the most part, meet with them in low men.
Arrogance is a weed that ever grows on a dunghill. It is from the rankness of that soil that she hath her height and spreadings. To be modest and unaffected with our superiors is duty; with our equals,
courtesy; with our inferiors, nobleness. There is no arrogance so great as the pro claiming of other men's errors and faults, by those who under stand nothing but the dregs of actions, and who make it
their business to besmear deserving fames. Public reproof is like striking a deer in the herd: it not only wounds him, to the loss of blood, but betrays him to the hound, his enemy.
The occupation of the spy hath ever been held dishonorable, and it is none the less so, now that with
rare exceptions editors and partisans have become perpetual spies upon the actions of ocher men. Their malice makes them nimbleeyed, apt to note a fault and publish it, and, with a strained construction, to
deprave even those things in which the doer's intents were honest. Like the crocodile, they slime the way of others, to make them fall; and when that has happened, they feed their insulting envy on the life
blood of the prostrate. They set the vices of other men on high, for the gaze of the world, and place their virtues underground, that none may note them. If they cannot wound upon proofs, they will do it
upon likelihoods: and if not upon them, they manufacture lies, as God created the world, out of nothing; and so corrupt the fair tempter of men's reputations; knowing that the multitude will believe them,
because affirmations are apter to win belief, than negatives to uncredit them; and that a lie travels faster than an eagle flies, while the contradiction limps after it at a snail's pace and halting, never overtakes it.
Nay, it is contrary to the morality of journalism, to allow a lie to be contradicted in the place that spawned it. And even if that great favor is conceded, a slander once raised will scarce ever die, or fail of
finding many that will allow it both a harbor and trust.
This is, beyond any other, the age of falsehood. Once, to be suspected of equivocation was enough to soil a gentleman's escutcheon; but now it has become a strange merit in a partisan or statesman, always
and scrupulously to tell the truth. Lies are part of the regular ammunition of all campaigns and controversies, valued according as they are profitable and effective; and are stored up and have a market
price, like saltpetre and sulphur; being even more deadly than they.
If men weighed the imperfections of humanity, they would breathe less condemnation. Ignorance gives disparagement a louder tongue than knowledge does. Wise men had rather know, than tell. Frequent
dispraises are but the faults of uncharitable wit: and it is from where there is no judgment, that the heaviest judgment comes; for selfexamination would make all judgments charitable. If we even do
know vices in men, we can scarce show ourselves in a nobler virtue than in the charity of concealing them: if that be not a flattery persuading to continuance. And it is the basest office man can fall into, to
make his tongue the defamer of the worthy man.

259/641
There is but one rule for the Mason in this matter. If there be virtues, and he is called upon to speak of
him who owns them, let him tell them forth impartially. And if there be vices mixed with them, let him be content the world shall know them by some other tongue than his. For if the evildoer deserve no
pity, his wife, his parents, or his children, or other innocent persons who love him may; and the bravo's trade, practised by him who stabs the defenceless for a price paid by individual or party, is really no
more respectable now than it was a hundred years ago, in Venice. Where we want experience, Charity bids us think the best, and leave what we know not to the Searcher of Hearts; for mistakes, suspicions,
and envy often injure a clear fame; and there is least danger in a charitable construction.
And, finally, the Mason should be humble and modest toward the Grand Architect of the Universe, and not impugn His Wisdom, nor set up his own imperfect sense of Right against His Providence and
dispensations, nor attempt too rashly to explore the Mysteries of God's Infinite Essence and inscrutable plans, and of that Great Nature which we are not made capable to understand.
Let him steer far away from all those vain philosophies, which endeavor to account for all that is,
without admitting that there is a God, separate and apart from the Universe which is his work: which erect Universal Nature into a God, and worship it alone: which annihilate Spirit, and believe no
testimony except that of the bodily senses: which, by logical formulas and dextrous collocation of words, make the actual, living, guiding, and protecting God fade into the dim mistiness of a mere
abstraction and unreality, itself a mere logical formula.
Nor let him have any alliance with those theorists who chide the delays of Providence and busy themselves to hasten the slow march which it has imposed upon events: who neglect the practical, to
struggle after impossibilities: who are wiser than Heaven; know the aims and purposes of the Deity, and can see a short and more direct means of attaining them, than it pleases Him to employ: who would
have no discords in the great harmony of the Universe of things; but equal distribution of property, no subjection of one man to the will of another, no compulsory labor, and still no starvation, nor
destitution, nor pauperism.
Let him not spend his life, as they do, in building a new Tower of Babel; in attempting to change that which is fixed by an inflexible law of God's enactment: but let him, yielding to the Superior Wisdom of
Providence, content to believe that the march of events is rightly ordered by an Infinite Wisdom, and leads, though we cannot see it, to a great and perfect result, let him be satisfied to follow the path
pointed out by that Providence, and to labor for the good of the human race in that mode in which God has chosen to enact that that good shall be effected: and above all, let him build no Tower of Babel,
under the belief that by ascending he will mount so high that God will disappear or be superseded by a great monstrous aggregate of material forces, or mere glittering, logical formula; but, evermore,
standing humbly and reverently upon the earth and looking with awe and confidence toward Heaven, let

him be satisfied that there is a real God; a person, and not a formula; a Father and a protector, who loves, and sympathizes, and compassionates; and that the eternal ways by which He rules the world are
infinitely wise, no matter how far they may be above the feeble comprehension and limited vision of man.
XXII. KNIGHT OF THE ROYAL AXE OR PRINCE OF LIBANUS
SYMPATHY with the great laboring classes, respect for labor itself, and resolution to do some good work in our day and generation, these are the lessons of this Degree, and they are purely Masonic.
Masonry has made a workingman and his associates the Heroes of her principal legend, and himself the companion of Kings. The idea is as simple and true as it is sublime. From first to last, Masonry is
work. It venerates the Grand Arckitrct of the Universe. It commemorates the building of a Temple. Its principal emblems are the working fools of Masons and Artisans. It preserves the name of the first
worker in brass and iron as one of its passwords. When the Brethren meet together, they are at labor. The Master is the overseer who sets the craft to work and gives them proper instruction. Masonry is the
apotheosis of Work. It is the hands of brave, forgotten men that have made this great, populous, cultivated world a world for us. It is all work, and forgotten work. The real conquerors, creators, and
eternal proprietors of every great and civilized land are all the heroic souls that ever were in it, each in his degree: all the men that ever felled a foresttree or drained a marsh, or contrived a wise scheme, or
did or said a true or valiant thing therein. Genuine work alone, done faithfully, is eternal, even as the Almighty Founder and Worldbuilder Himself.
All work is noble: a life of ease is not for any man, nor for any God. The Almighty Maker is not like
one who, in old immemorial ages, having made his machine of a Universe, sits ever since, and sees it go. Out of that belief comes Atheism. The faith in an Invisible, unnamable, Directing Deity, present
everywhere in all that we see, and work, and suffer, is the essence of all faith whatsoever.
The life of all Gods figures itself to us as a Sublime Earnestness, of Infinite battle against Infinite labor Our highest religion is named the Worship of Sorrow. For the Son of Man there is no noble crown,
wellworn, or even illworn, but is a crown of thorns. Man's highest destiny is not to be happy, to love pleasant things and find them. His only true unhappiness should be that he cannot work, and get his
destiny as a man fulfilled. The day passes swiftly over, our life passes swiftly over, and the night cometh, wherein no man can work. That nights once come, our happiness and unhappiness are
vanished, and become as things that never were. But our work is not abolished, and has not vanished. It remains, or the want of it remains, for endless Times and Eternities.
Whatsoever of morality and intelligence; what of patience, perseverance, faithfulness, of method,

261/641
insight, ingenuity, energy; in a word, whatsoever of STRENGTH a man has in him, will lie written in the WORK he does. To work is to try himself against Nature and her unerring, everlasting laws : and
they will return true verdict as to him. The noblest Epic is a mighty Empire slowly built together, a mighty series of heroic deeds, a mighty conquest over chaos. Deeds are greater than words. They have a
life, mute, but undeniably ; and grow. They people the vacuity of Time, and make it green and worthy.
Labor is the truest emblem of God, the Architect and Eternal Maker; noble Labor, which is yet to be the King of this Earth, and sit on the highest Throne. Men without duties to do, are like trees planted on
precipices; from the roots of which all the earth has crumbled. Nature owns no man who is not also a Martyr. She scorns the man who sits screened from all work, from want, danger, hardship, the victory
over which is work and has all his work and battling done by other men; and yet there are men who pride themselves that they and theirs have done no work time out of mind. So neither have the swine.
The chief of men is he who stands in the van of men, fronting the peril which frightens back all others,
and if not vanquished would devour them. Hercules was worshipped for twelve labors. The Czar of Russia became a toiling shipwright, and worked with his axe in the docks of Saardam ; and something
came of that. Cromwell worked, and Napoleon; and effected somewhat.
There is a perennial nobleness and even sacredness in work. Be he never so benighted and forgetful of his high calling, there is always hope in a man who actually and earnestly works : in Idleness alone is
there perpetual Despair. Man perfects himself by working. Jungles are cleared away. Fair seedfields rise instead, and stately cities ; and withal, the man himself first ceases to be a foul unwholesome jungle
and desert thereby. Even in the meanest sort of labor, the whole soul of man is composed into a kind of real harmony, the moment he begins to work. Doubt, Desire, Sorrow, Remorse, Indignation, and even
Despair shrink murmuring far off into their caves, whenever the man bends himself resolutely against his task. Labor is life. From the inmost heart of the worker rises his Godgiven Force, the Sacred
Celestial life essence, breathed into him by Almighty God ; and awakens him to all nobleness, as soon as work fitly begins. By it man learns Patience, Courage, Perseverance, Openness to light, readiness to
own himself mistaken, resolution to do better and improve. Only by labor will man continually learn the virtues.
There is no Religion in stagnation and inaction; but only in activity and exertion. There was the deepest
truth in that saying of the old monks, "laborare est orare." "He prayeth best who liveth best all things both great and small;" and can man love except by working earnestly to benefit that being whom he
loves?

subdue him, and make order of him, the subject not of Chaos, but of Intelligence and Divinity, and of ourselves ; to attack ignorance, stupidity and brutemindedness, wherever found, to smite it wisely and
unweariedly, to rest not while we live and it lives in the name of God, this is our duty as Masons; commanded us by the Highest God. Even He, with his unspoken voice, more awful than the thunders of
Sinai, or the syllabled speech of the Hurricane, speaks to us. The Unborn Ages ; the old Graves, with their longmoldering dust speak to us. The deep DeathKingdoms, the Stars in their neverresting
course, all Space and all Time, silently and continually admonish us that we too must work whore it is called today. Labor, wide as the Earth, has its summit in Heaven. To toil, whether with the sweat of the
brow, or of the brain or heart, is worship, the noblest thing yet discovered beneath the Stars. Let the weary cease to think that labor is a curse and doom pronounced by Deity. Without it there could be no
true excellence in human nature. Without it, and pain, and sorrow, where would be the human virtues? Where Patience, Perseverance, Submission, Energy, Endurance, Fortitude, Bravery, Disinterestedness,
SelfSacrifice, the noblest excellencies of the Soul?
Let him who toils complain not, nor feel humiliated! Let him look up and see his fellowworkmen there, in God's Eternity, they alone surviving there. Even in the weak human memory they long survive, as
Saints, as Heroes, and as Gods : they alone survive, and people the unmeasured solitudes of Time. To the primeval man, whatsoever good came, descended on him (as in mere fact, it ever does) direct from
God; whatsoever duty lay visible for him, this a Supreme God had prescribed. For the primeval man, in whom dwelt Thought, this Universe was all a Temple, life everywhere a Worship.
Duty is with us ever and evermore forbids us to be idle. To work with the hands or brain, according to
our requirements and our capacities, to do that which lies before us to do, is more honorable than rank and title. Ploughers, spinners and builders, inventors, and men of science, poets, advocates, and writers,
all stand upon one common level, and form on grand, innumerable host, marching ever onward since the beginning of the world: each entitled to our sympathy and respect, each a man and our brother.
It was well to give the earth to man as a dark mass, whereon to labor. It was well to provide rude and
uprightly materials in the orebed and the forest, for him to fashion into splendor and beauty. It was well, not because of that splendor and beauty; but because the act creating them is better than the things
themselves; because exertion is nobler than enjoyment; because the laborer is greater and more worthy of honor than the idler. Masonry stands up for the nobility of labor. It is Heaven's great ordinance for
human improvement. It has been broken down for ages ; and Masonry desires to build it up again. It has bean broken down, because men toil only because ihey must, submitting to it as, in some sort, a
degrading necessity; and desiring nothing so much on earth as to escape from it. They fulfill the great law of labor in the letter, but break it in the spirit: they fulfill it with the muscles, but break it with the
mind.
Masonry teaches that every idler ought to hasten to some field of labor, manual or mental, as a chosen

and coveted theatre of improvement; but he is not impelled to do so, under the teachings of an imperfect civilization.
On the contrary, he sits down, folds his hands, and blesses and glorifies himself in his idleness. It is
time that this opprobrium of toil were done away. To be ashamed of toil; of the dingy workshop and dusty laborfield; of the hard hand, stained with service more honorable than that of war; of the soiled
and weatherstained garments, on which Mother Nature has stamped, midst sun and rain, midst fire and steam, her own heraldic honors; to be ashamed of these tokens and titles, and envious of the flaunting
robes of imbecile idleness and vanity, is treason to Nature, impiety to Heaven, a breach of Heaven's great Ordinance. Toil,) of brain, heart, or hand, is the only true manhood and genuine nobility.
Labor is a more beneficent ministration than man's ignorance comprehends, or his complaining will
admit. Even when its end is hidden from him, it is not mere blind drudgery, It is all a training, a discipline, a development of energies, a nurse of virtues, a school bf improvement. From the poor boy
who gathers a few sticks for his mother's hearth, to the strong man who fells the oak or guides the ship or the steamcar, every human toiler, with every weary step and every urgent task, is obeying a wisdom
far above his own wisdom, and fulfilling a design far beyond his own design.
The great law of human industry is this: that industry, working either with the hand or the mind, the application of our powers to some task, to the achievement of some result, lies at the foundation of all
human improvement. We are not sent into the world like animals, to crop the spontaneous herbage of the field, and then to lie down in indolent repose: but we are sent to dig the soil and plough the sea; to
do the business of cities and the world of manufactories. The world is the great and appointed school of industry. In an artificial state of society, mankind is divided into the idle and the laboring classes; but
such was not the design of Providence.
Labor is man's great function, his peculiar distinction and his privilege. From being an animal, that eats and drinks and sleeps only, to become a worker, and with the hand of ingenuity to pour his own
thoughts into the moulds of Nature, fashioning ttorn into forms of grace and fabrics of convenience, and converting them to purposes of improvement and happiness, is the greatest possible step in privilege.
The Earth and the Atmosphere are man's laboratory. With spade and plough, with miningshafts and
furnaces and forges, with fire and steam; midst the noise and whirl of swift and bright machinery, and abroad in the silent fields, man was made to be ever working, ever experimenting. And while he and all
his dwellings of care and toil are borne onward with the circling skies, and the splendour of Heaven are around him, and their infinite depths image and invite his thought, still in all the worlds of philosophy,
in the universe of intellect, man must be a worker. He is nothing, he can be nothing, can achieve nothing, fulfill nothing, without working. Without it, he can gain neither lofty improvement nor

tolerable happiness. The idle must hunt down the hours as their prey. To them Time is an enemy, clothed with armor; and they must kill him, or: themselves die. It never yet did answer, and it never will
answer for any man to do nothing, to be exempt from all care and effort to lounge, to walk, to ride, and to feast alone. No man can live in that way. God made a law against it: which no human power can
annul, no human ingenuity evade.
The idea that a property is to be acquired in the course of ten or twenty years, which shall suffice for the rest of life; that by some prosperous traffic or grand speculation, all the labor of a whole life is to be
accomplished in a brief portion of it; that by dexterous management, a large part of the term of human existence is to be exonerated from the cares of industry and self denial, is founded upon a grave
mistake, upon a misconception of the true nature and design of business, and of the conditions of human well being. The desire of accumulation for the sake of securing a life of ease and gratification,
of escaping from exertion and selfdenial, is wholly wrong, though very common.
It is better for the Mason to live while he lives, and enjoy life as it passes to live richer and die poorer. It is best of all for him to banish from the mind that empty dream of future indolence and indulgent ; to
address himself to the business of life, as the school of his earthly education; to settle it with himself now that independence, if he gains it, is not to give him exemption from employment It is best for him
to know, that, in order to be a happy man, he must always be a laborer, with the mind or the body, or with both: and that the reasonable exertion of his powers, bodily and mental, is not to be regarded as
mere drudgery, but as a good discipline, a wise ordination, a training in this primary school of our being, for nobler endeavors, and spheres of higher activity hereafter
There are reasons why a Mason may lawfully and even earnestly desire a fortune. If he can fill some
fine palace, itself a work of art, with the productions of lofty genius; if he can be the friend and helper of humble worth; if he can seek it out, where failing health or adverse fortune presses it hard, and soften
or stay the bitter hours that are hastening it to madness or to the grave; if he can stand between the oppressor and his prey, and bid the fetter and the dungeon give up their victim ; if he can build up great
institutions of learning, and academies of art ; if he can open fountains of knowledge for the people, and conduct its streams in the right channels; if he can do better for the poor thzn to bestow alms upon
themeven to think of them, and devise plans for their elevation in knowledge and virtue, instead of forever opening the , old reservoirs and resources for their improvidence; if he has sufficient heart and
soul to do all this, or part of it; if wealth would be ta him the handmaid of exertion; facilitating effort, and giving success to endeavor; then may he lawfully, and yet warily and modestly, desire it. But if it is
to do nothing for him, but (o minister ease and indulgence, and to place his children in the same bad school, then there is no reason why he should desire it.

cultivated fields, but its toil? The busy marts, the rising cities, the enriched empires of the world are but the great treasurehouses of labor. The pyramids of Egypt, the' castles and towers and temples of
Europe, the buried cities of Italy and Mexico, the canals and railroads of Christendom, are but tracks, all round the world, of the mighty footsteps of labor. Without it antiquity would not have been. Without
it, there would be no memory of the past, and no hope for the future. Even utter indolence reposes on treasures that labor at some time gained and gathered. He that does nothing, and yet does not starve, has
still his significance ; for he is a standing proof that somebody has at some time worked. But not to such does Masonry do honor. It honors the Worker, the Toiler; him who produces and not alone
consumes; him who puts forth his hand to add to the treasury of human comforts, and not alone to take away. "It honors him who goes forth amid the struggling elements to fight his battle, and who shrinks
not, with cowardly effeminacy, behind pillows of ease. It honors the strong muscle, and the manly nerve, and the resolute and brave heart, the sweating brow, and the toiling brain. It honors the great and
beautiful offices of humanity, manhood's toil and woman's task; paternal industry and maternal watching and weariness ; wisdom teaching and patience learning; the brow of care that presides over
the State, and many handed labor that toils in workshop, field, and study, beneath its mild and beneficent sway.
God has not made a world of rich men; but rather a world of poor men; or of men, at least, who must
toil for a subsistence. That is, then, the best condition for man, and the grand sphere of human improvement. If the whole world could acquire wealth (and one man is as much entitled to it as another,
when he is born); if the present generation could lay up a complete provision for the next, as some men desire to do for their children; the world would be destroyed at a single blow. All industry would cease
with the necessity for it; all improvement would stop with the demand for exertion; the dissipation of fortunes, the mischief of which are now countervailed by the healthful tone of society, would breed
universal disease, and wreak out into universal license; and the world would sink, rotten as Herod, into the grave of its own loathsome vices.
Almost all the noblest things that have been achieved in the world, have been achieved by poor men;
poor scholars, poor professional men, poor artisans and artists, poor philosophers, poets, and men of genius. A certain solidness and sobriety, a certain moderation and restraint, a certain pressure of
circumstances, are good for man. His body was not made for luxuries. It sickens, sinks, and dies under them. His mind was not made for indulgerice. It grows weak, effeminate, and dwarfish, under that
condition. And he who pampers his body with luxuries and his mind with indulgence, bequeaths the consequences to the minds and bodies of his descendants, without the wealth which was their cause.
For wealth, without a law of entail to help it, has always lacked the energy even to keep its own treasures. They drop from its imbecile hand. The third generation almost inevitably goes down the
rolling wheel of fortune, and there learns the energy necessary to rise again, if it rises at all ; heir, as it is, to the bodily diseases, and mental weaknesses, and the soul's vices of its andestors, and not heir to
their wealth. And yet we are, almost all of us, anxious to put our children, or to insure that our grandchildren shall be put, on this road to indulgence, luxury, vice, degradation, and ruin ; this
headship of hereditary disease, soul malady, and mental leprosy.

If wealth were employed in promoting mental culture at home and works of philanthropy abroad; if it
were multiplying studies of art, and building up institutions of learning around us; if it were in every way raising the intellectual character of the world, there could scarcely be too much of it. But if the
utmost aim, effort, and ambition of wealth be, to procure rich furniture, and provide costly entertainments, and build luxurious houses, and minister to vanity, extravagance, and ostentation, there
could scarcely be too little of it. To a certain extent it may laudably be the minister of elegancies and luxuries, and the servitor of hospitality and physical enjoyment: but just in proportion as its tendencies,
divested of all higher aims and tastes, are running that way, they are running to peril and evil.
Nor does that peril attach to individuals and families alone. It stands, a fearful beacon, in the experience of Cities, Republics, and Empires. The lessons of past times, on this subject, are emphatic and solemn.
The history of wealth has always been a history of corruption and downfall. the people never existed that could stand the trial. Boundless profusion is too little likely to spread for any people the theatre of
manly energy, rigid selfdenial, and lofty virtue. You do not look for the bone and sinew and strength of a country, its loftiest talents and virtues, its martyrs to patriotism or religion, its men to meet the days of
peril and disaster, among the children of ease, indulgence, and luxury.
In the great march of the races of men over the earth, we have always seen opulence and luxury sinking before poverty and toil and hardy nurture. That is the law which has presided over the great professions
of empire. Sidon and Tyre, whose merchants possessed the wealth of princes; Babylon and Palmyra, the seats of Asiatic luxury; Rome, laden with the spoils of a world, overwhelmed by her own vices more
than by the hosts of her enemies; all these, and many more, are examples of the destroytive tendencies of immense and unnatural accumulation : and men must become more generous and benevolent, not
more selfish and effeminate, as they become more rich, or the history of modern wealth will follow in the sad train of all past examples. All men desire distinction, and feel the need of some ennobling
object in life. Those persons are usually most happy and satisfied in their pursuits, who have the loftiest ends in view. Artists, mechanics, and inventors, all who seek to find principles or develop beauty in
their work, seem most to enjoy it. The farmer who labors for the beautifying and scientific cultivation of his estate, is more happy in his labors than one who tills his own land for a mere subsistence. This is
one of the signal testimonies which all human employments give to the high demands of our nature. To gather wealth never gives such satisfaction as to bring the humblest piece of machinery to perfection: at
least, when wealth is sought for display and ostentation, or mere luxury, and ease, and pleasure; and not for ends of philanthropy, the relief of kindred, or the payment of just debts, or as a means to attain some
other great and noble object.
With the pursuits of multitudes is connected a painful conviction that they neither supply a sufficient object, nor confer any satisfactory honor. Why work, if the world is soon not to know that such a being
ever existed; and when one can perpetuate his name neither on canvas nor on marble, nor in books, nor by lofty eloquence, nor statesmanship?

The answer is, that every man has a work to do in himself, greater and sublimed than any work of
genius ; and works upon a nobler material than wood or marbleupon his own soul and intellect, and may so attain the highest nobleness and grandeur known on earth or in Heaven; may so be the greatest
of artists, and of authors, and his life, which is far more than speech, may be eloquent.
The great author or artist only portrays what every man should be. He conceives, what we should do. He conceives, and represents moral beauty, magnanimity, fortitude, love, devotion, forgiveness, the
soul's greatness. He portrays virtues, commended to our admiration and imitations. To embody these portraitures in our lives is the practical realization of those great ideals of art. The magnanimity of
Heroes, celebrated on the historic or poetic page; the constancy and faith of Truth's martyrs ; the beauty of love and piety glowing on the canvas; the delineations of Truth and Right, that flash from the lips of
the Eloquent, are, in their essence only that which every man may feel and practice in the daily walks of life. The work of virtue is nobler than any work of genius; for it is a nobler thing to be a hero than to
describe one to endure martyrdom than to paint it, to do right than to plead for it. Action is greater than writing. A good man is a nobler object of contemplation than a great author. There are but two things
worth living for: to do what is worthy of being written; and to write what is worthy of being read; and the greater of these is the doing.
Every man has to do the noblest thing that any man can do or describe. There is a wide field for the
courage, cheerfulness, energy, and dignity of human existence. Let therefore no Mason deem his life doomed to mediocrity or meanness, to vanity or unprofitable toil, or to any ends less than immortal. No
one can truly say that the grand prizes of life are for others, and he can do nothing. No matter how magnificent and noble an act the author can describe or the artist paint,' it will be still nobler for you to
go and do that which one describes, or be the model which the other draws.
The loftiest action that ever was described is not more magnatemous than that which we may find occasion to do, in the daily walks of life; in temptation, in distress, in bereavement, in the solemn
approach to death. In the great Providence of God, in the great ordinances of our being, there is opened to every man a sphere for the noblest action. It is not even in extraordinary situations, where all eyes are
upon us, where all our energy is aroused, and all our vigilance is awake that the highest efforts of virtue are usually demanded of us; but rather in silence and seclusion, amidst our occupations and our homes;
in wearing sickness, that makes no complaint; in sorelytried honesty, that asks no praise; in simple disinterestedness, hiding the hand that resigns its advantage to another.
Masonry seeks to ennoble common life. Its work is to go down into the obscure and researched records
of daily conduct and feeling; and to portray, not the ordinary virtue of an extraordinary life; but the more extraordinary virtue of ordinary life. What is done and borne in the shades of privacy, in the hard
and beaten pafh of daily care and toil, full of recelebrated sacrifices; in the suffering, and sometimes

insulted suffering, that wears to the world a cheerful brow; in the Iong strife of the spirit, resisting pain, penury, and neglect, carried on in the inmost depths of the heart;what is done, and borne, and wrought,
and won there, is a higher glory, and shall inherit a brighter crown.
On the volume of Masonic life one bright word is written from which on every side blazes an ineffable splendor. That word is DUTY. To aid in securing to all labor permanent employment and its just
reward: to help to hasten the coming of that time when no one shall suffer from hunger or destitution, because, though willing and able to work, he can find no employment, or because he has been
overtaken by sickness in the midst of his labor, are part of your duties as a Knight of the Royal Axe. And if we can succeed in making some small nook of God's creation a little more fruitful and cheerful,
a little better and more worthy of Him, or in making some one or two human hearts a little wiser, and more manful and hopeful and happy, we shall have done work, worthy of Masons and acceptable to our
Father in Heaven.

XXIII CHIEF OF THE TABERNACLE
AMONG most of the Ancient Nations there was, in addition to their public worship, a private one
styled the Mysteries; to which those only were admitted who had been prepared by certain ceremonies called initiations.
The most widely disseminated of the ancient worships were those of Isis, Orpheus, Dionysus, Ceres and
Mathias. Many barbarous nations received the knowledge of the Mysteries in honor of these divinities from the Egyptians, before they arrived in Greece and even in the British Isles the Druids celebrated
those of Dionysus, learned by them from the Egyptians.
The Mysteries of Eleusis, celebrated at Athens in honor of Ceres, swallowed up as it were, all the others. All the neighboring nations neglected their own, to celebrate those of Eleusis; and in a little
while all Greece and Asia Minor were filled with the Initiates. They spread into the Roman Empire, and even beyond its limits, "those holy and august Eleusinian Mysteries," said Cicero, "in which the people
of the remotest lands are initiated." Zosimus says that they embraced the whole human race and Aristides termed them the common temple of the whole world.
There were, in the Eleusinian feasts, two sorts of Mysteries, the great, and the little. The latter were a
kind of preparation for the former; and everybody was admitted to them. Ordinarily there was a novitiate of three, and sometimes of four years. Clement of Alexandria says that what was taught in the
great Mysteries concerned the Universe, and was the completion and perfection of all instruction; wherein things were seen as they were, and nature and her works were made known.
The ancients said that the Initiates would be more happy after death than other mortals ; and that, while
the souls of the Profane on leaving their bodies, would be plunged in the mire, and remain buried in darkness, those of the Initiates would fly to the Fortunate Isles, the abode of the Gods.
Plato said that the object of the Mysteries was to reestablish the soul in its primitive purity, and in that
state of perfection which it had lost. Epictetus said, "whatever is met with therein has been instituted by our Masters, for the instruction of man and the correction of morals."
Process held that initiation elevated the soul, from a material, sensual, and purely human life, to a
communion and celestial intercourse with the Gods ; and that a variety of things, forms, and species were shown Initiates, representing the first generation of the Gods.

270/641
Purity of morals and elevation of soul were required of the, Initiates. 'Candidates were required to be of
spotless reputation and irreproachable virtue. Nero, after murdering his mother, did not dare to be present at the celebration of the Mysteries and Antony presented himself to be initiated, as the most
infallible mode of proving his innocence of the death of Avidius Cassius. The Initiates were regarded as the only fortunate men. "It is upon us alone," says Aristophanes, "shineth the beneficent daystar. We
alone receive pleasure from the influence of his rays we, who are initiated, and who practice toward citizen and stranger every possible act of justice and piety." And it is therefore not surprising that, in
time, initiation came to be considered as necessary as baptism afterward was to the Christians ; and that not to have been admitted to the Mysteries was held a dishonor.
"It seems to me," says the great orator, philosopher, and moralist, Cicero, "that Athens, among many
excellent inventions, divine and very useful to the human family, has produced none comparable to the
Mysteries, which for a wild and ferocious life have substituted humanity and urbanity of manners. �It
is with good reason they use the term initiation; for it is through them that we in reality have learned the first principles of life; and they not only teach us to live in a manner more consoling and agreeable, but
they soften the pains of death by the hope of a better life hereafter."
Where the Mysteries originated is not known. It is supposed that they came from India, by the way of Chaldaea, into Egypt, and thence were carried into Greece. Wherever they arose, they were practiced
among all the ancient nations and as was usual the Thracians, Cretins, and Athenians each claimed the honor of invention, and each insisted that they had borrowed nothing from any other people.
In Egypt and the East, all religions even in its most poetical forms, was more or less a mystery; and the
chief reason why, in Greece, a distinct name and office were assigned to the Mysteries, was because the superficial popular theology left a want unsatisfied, which religion in a wider sense alone could supply.
They were practical acknowledgments of the insufficiency of the popular religion to satisfy the deeper thoughts and aspirations of the mind. The vagueness of symbolism might perhaps reach what a more
palpable and conventional creed could not. The former, be its indefiniteness, acknowledged the abstruseness of its subject; it treated a mysterious subject myopically ; it endeavored to illustrate what it
could not explain; to excite an appropriate feeling, if it could not develop an adequate idea and shade the image a mere subordinate conveyance for the conception, which itself never became too obvious or
familiar.
The instruction now conveyed by books and letters was of old conveyed by symbols and the priest had to invent or to perpetuate a display of rites and exhibitions, which were not only more attractive to the
eye than words, but often to the mind more suggestive and pregnant with meaning.

271/641
Afterward, the institution became rather moral and political, than religious. The civil magistrates shaped the ceremonies to political ends in Egypt; the sages who carried them from that country to Asia,
Greece; and the North of Europe, were all kings or legislators. The chief magistrate presided at those of Eleusis, represented by an officer styled King and the Priest played but a subordinate part.
The Powers revered in the Mysteries were all in reality Natured Gods; none of whom could be
consistently addressed as mere heroes, because their nature was confessedly superheroic. The Mysteries, only in fact a more solemn expression of the religion of the ancient poetry, taught that
doctrine of the Theocracia or Divine Oneness, which even poetry does not entirely conceal. They were not in any open hostility with the popular religion, but only a more solemn exhibition of its symbols; or
rather a part of itself in a more impressive form. The essence of all Mysteries, as of all polytheism, consists in this, that the conception of an inapproachable Being, single, eternal, and unchanging, and
that of a God of Nature, whose manifold power is immediately revealed to the senses in the incessant round of movement, life and death, fell asunder in the treatment, and were separately symbolized. They
offered a perpetual problem to excite curiosity, and contributed to satisfy the allpervading religious sentiment, which if it obtain no nourishment among the scruple and intelligible, finds compensating
excitement in a reverential contemplation of the obscure.
Nature is as free from dogmatism as from tyranny and the earliest instructors of mankind not only adopted her lessons, but as far as possible adhered to her method of imparting them. They attempted to
reach the understanding through the eye and the greater part of all religious teaching was conveyed through this ancient and most impressive mode of "exhibition" or demonstration. The Mysteries were a
sacred drama, exhibiting some legend significant of
Nature's change, of the visible Universe in which the divinity is revealed, and whose import was in
many respects as open to the Pagan, as to the Christian. Beyond the current traditions or sacred recitals of the temple, few explanations were given to the spectators, who were left, as in the school of nature,
to make inferences for themselves.
The method of indirect suggestion, by allegory or symbol, is a more efficacious instrument of instruction than plain didactic "language; since we are habitually indifferent to that which is acquired
without effort: "The initiated are few, though many bear the thyrsus." And it would have been impossible to provide a lesson suited to every degree of cultivation and capacity, unless it were one
framed after Nature's example, or rather a representation of Nature herself, employing her universal symbolism instead of technicalities of language, inviting endless research, yet rewarding the humblest
inquirer, and disclosing its secrets to every one in proportion to his preparatory training and power to comprehend them.
Even if destitute of any formal or official enunciation of those important truths, which even in a
cultivated age it was often found inexpedient to assert except under a veil of allegory, and which

moreover lose their dignity and value in proportion as they are learned mechanically as dogmas, the shows of the Mysteries certainly contained suggestions if not lessons, which in the opinion not of one
competent witness only, but if many, were adapted to elevate the character of the spectators, enabling them to augur something of the purposes of existence, as well as of the means of employing it, to live
better and to die happier.
Unlike the religion of books or creeds, these mystic shows performances were not the reading of a lecture, but the opening of a problem, implying neither exemption from research, nor hostility to
philosophy: for on the contrary, philosophy is the great Mystagogue or ArchExpounder of symbolism : though the interpretations by the Grecian Philosophy of the old myths and symbols were in many
instances as illfounded, as in others they are correct.
No better means could be devised to rouse a dormant intellect than those impressive exhibitions, which addressed it through the imagination: which, instead of condemning it to a prescribed routine of creed,
invited it to seek, compare, and judge. The alteration from symbol to dogma is as fatal to beauty of expression, as that from faith to dogma is to truth and wholesomeness of thought The first philosophy
often reverted to the natural mode of teaching; and Socrates, in particular, is said to have eschewed dogmas, endeavoring, like the Mysteries, rather to awaken and develop in the minds of his hearers the
ideas with which they were already endowed or pregnant, than to fill them with readymade adventitious opinions.
So Masonry still follows the ancient manner of teaching. Her symbols are the instruction she gives ; and
the lectures are but often partial and insufficient onesided endeavors to interpret those symbols. He who would become an accomplished Mason must not be content merely to hear or even to understand
the lectures, but must, aided by them, and they having as it were marked out the way for him, study, interpret, and develop the symbols for himself.
The earliest speculation endeavored to express far more than it could distinctly comprehend ; and the
vague impressions if the mind found in the mysterious analogies of phenomena their most apt and energetic representations. The Mysteries, like the symbols of Masonry, were but an image of the
eloquent analogies of Nature; both those and these revealing no new secret to such as were or are unprepared, or incapable of interpreting their significance.
Everywhere in the old Mysteries, and in all the symbolisms and ceremonial of the Hierophant was
found the same mythical personage, who, like Hermes, or Zoroaster, unites Human Attributes with Divine, and is himself the God whose worship he introduced, teaching rude men the commencements
of civilization through the influence of song, and connecting with the symbol of his death, emblematic of that of Nature, the most essential consolations of religion.

The Mysteries embraced the three great doctrines of Ancient Theosophy. They treated of God, Man,
and Nature. Dionysus, whose Mysteries Orpheus is said to have founded, was the God of Nature, or of the moisture which is the life of Nature, who prepares in darkness the return of life and vegetation, or
who is him self the Light and Change evolving their varieties. He was theologically one with Hermes, Prometheus, and Poseidon. In the Aegean Islands he is Butes, Dardanus, Himeros, or Imbros. In Crete
he appears as Iasius or Zeus, whose worship remaining unveiled by the usual forms of mystery, betrayed to profane curiosity the symbols, which, if irreverently contemplated, were sure to be misunderstood. In
Asia he is the longstoled Bassareus coalescing with the Sabazius of the Phrygian Corybantes: the same with the mystic Iacchus, nursling or son of Ceres, and with the dismembered Zagreus, son of
Persephone. In symbolical forms the Mysteries exhibited THE ONE, of which THE MANIFOLD Is an infinite illustration, containing a moral lesson, calculated to guide the soul through life, and to cheer it
in death. The story of Dionysus was profoundly significant. He was not only creator of the world, but guardian, liberator, and Savior of the soul. God of the manycolored mantle, he was the resulting
manifestation personified, the all in the many, the varied year, life passing into innumerable forms.
The spiritual regeneration of man was typified in the Mysteries by the second birth of Dionysus as offspring of the Highest; and the agents and symbols of that regeneration were the elements that
affected Nature's periodical purificationthe air, indicated by the mystic fan or winnow; the fire, signified by the torch ; and the baptismal water, for water is not only cleanser of all things, but the
genesis or source of all.
Those notions, clothed in ritual, suggested the soul's, reformation and training, the moral purity formally proclaimed at Eleusis. He only was invited to approach, who was "of clean hands and
ingenuous speech, free from all pollution, and with a clear conscience."Happy the man," say the initiated in Euripides and Aristophanes, "who purifies his life, and who reverently consecrates his soul
in the thirsts of the God. Let him take heed to his lips that he utter no profane word; let him be just and kind to the stranger, and to his neighbor; let him give way to no vicious excess, lest he make dull and
heavy the organs of the spirit. Far from the mystic dance of the thirsts be the impure, the evil speaker, the seditious citizen, the selfish hunter after gain, the traitor ; all those, in short, whose practices are
more akin to the riot of Titans than to the regulated life of the Orphici, or the Curetan order of the Priests of Idaean Zeus."
The votary, elevated beyond the sphere of his ordinary faculties, and unable to account for the agitation
which overpowered him, seemed to become divine. in proportion as he ceased to be human; to be a demon or god. Already, in imagination, the initiated were numbered among the beatified. They alone
enjoyed the true life, the Sun's true lustre, while they hymned their God beneath the mystic groves of a mimic Elysium, and were really renovated or regenerated under the genial influence of their dances.

"They whom Proserpine guides in her mysteries," it was said, "who imbibed her instruction and spiritual nourishment, rest from their labors and know strife no more. Happy they who witness and
comprehend these sacred ceremonies! They are made to know the meaning of the riddle of existence by observing its aim and termination as appointed by Zeus ; they partake a benefit more valuable and
enduring than the grain bestowed by wares ; for they are exalted in the scale of intellectual existence, and obtain sweet hopes to console them at their death."
No doubt the ceremonies of initiation were originally few and simple. As the great truths of the
primitive revelation faded out of the memories of the masses of the People, and wickedness became rife upon the earth, it became necessary to discriminate, to require longer probation and satisfactory tests of
the candidates, and by spreading around what at first were rather schools of instruction than mysteries, the veil of secrecy, and the pomp of ceremony, to heighten the opinion of their value and importance.
Whatever pictures later and especially Christian writers may draw of the Mysteries, they must, not only
originally, but for many ages, have continued pure; and the doctrines of natural religion and morals there taught, have been of the highest importance; because both the most virtuous as well as the most
learned and philosophic of the ancients speak of them in the loftiest terms. That they ultimately became degraded from their high estate, and corrupted, we know.
The rites of initiation became progressively more complicated. Signs and tokens were invented by
which the Children of Light could with facility make themselves known to each other. Differ. ant Degrees were invented, as the number of Initiates enlarged, in order that there might be in the inner
apartment of the Temple a favored few, to whom alone the more valuable secrets were entrusted, and who could wield effectually the influence and power of the Order. Originally the Mysteries were meant
to be the beginning of a new life of reason and virtue. The initiated or esoteric companions were taught the doctrine of the One Supreme God, the theory of death and eternity, the hidden mysteries of Nature,
the prospect of the ultimate restoration of the soul to that state of perfection from which it had fallen, its immortality, and the states of reward and punishment after death. The uninitiated were deemed Profane,
unworthy of public employment or private confidence, sometimes prescribed as Atheists, and certain of everlasting punishment beyond the grave.
All persons were initiated into the lesser Mysteries; but few attained the greater, in which the true spirit
of them, and most of their secret doctrines were hidden. The veil of secrecy was impenetrable, sealed by oaths and penalties the most tremendous and appalling. It was by initiation only, that a knowledge of
the Hieroglyphics could be obtained, with which the walls, columns, and ceilings of the Temples were decorated, and which, believed to have been communicated to the Priests by revelation from the
celestial deities, the youth of all ranks were laudably ambitious of deciphering.

The ceremonies were performed at dead of night, generally in apartments underground, but sometimes in the centre of a vast pyramid, with every appliance that could alarm and excite the candidate.
Innumerable ceremonies, wild and romantic, dreadful and appalling, had by degrees been added to the few expressive symbols of primitive observances, under which there were instances in which the
terrified aspirant actually expired with fear. The pyramids were probably used for the purposes of initiation, as were caverns, pagodas, and labyrinths; for the ceremonies required many apartments and
cells, long passages and wells. In Egypt a principal place for the Mysteries was the island of Philae on the Nile, where a magnificent Temple of Osiris stood, and his relics were said to be preserved.
With their natural proclivities, the Priesthood, that select and exclusive class, in Egypt, India,
Phoenicia, Judea and Greece, as well as in Britain and Rome, and wherever else the Mysteries were known, made use of them to build wider and higher the fabric of their own power. The purity of no
religion continues long. Rank and dignities succeed to the primitive simplicity. Unprincipled, vain, insolent, corrupt, and venal men put on God's livery to serve the Devil withal; and luxury, vice,
intolerance, and pride depose frugality, virtue, gentleness, and humility, and change the altar where they should be servants, to a throne on which they reign.
But the Kings, Philosophers, and Statesmen, the wise and great and good who were admitted to the
Mysteries, long postponed their ultimate selfdestruction, and restrained the natural tendencies of the Priesthood. And accordingly Zosimus thought that the neglect of the Mysteries after Diocletian
abdicated, was the chief cause of the decline of the Roman Empire ; and in the year 364, the Proconsul of Greece would not close the Mysteries, notwithstanding a law of the Emperor Valentinian, lest the
people should be driven to desperation, if prevented from performing them; upon which, as they believed, the welfare of mankind wholly depended. They were practiced in Athens until the 8th century
in Greece and Rome for several centuries after Christ; and in Wales and Scotland down to the 12th century.
The inhabitants of India originally practiced the Patriarchal religion. Even the later worship of Vishnu
was cheerful and social; accompanied with the festive song, the sprightly dance, and the resounding cymbal, with libations of milk and honey, garlands, and perfumes from aromatic woods and gums.
There perhaps the Mysteries commenced; and in them, under allegories, were taught the primitive truths. We cannot, within the limits of this lecture, detail the ceremonies of initiation; and shall use
general language, except where something from those old Mysteries still remains in Masonry.
The Initiate was invested with a cord of three threads, so twined as to make three times three, and called zennar. Hence comes our cabletow. It was an emblem of their triune Deity, the remembrance of
whom we also preserve in the three chief officers of our Lodges, presiding in the three quarters of that Universe which our Lodges represent; in our three greater and three lesser lights, our three movable and
three immovable jewels, and the three pillars that support our Lodges.

The Indian Mysteries were celebrated in subterranean caverns and grottos hewn in the solid rock; and
the Initiates adored the Deity, symbolized by the solar fire. The candidate, long wandering in darkness, truly wanted Light, and the worship taught him was the worship of God, the Source of Light. The vast
Temple of Elephants, perhaps the oldest in the world, hewn out of the rock, and 135 feet square, was used for initiations; as were the still vaster caverns of Salsette, with their 300 apartments.
The periods of initiation were regulated by the increase and decrease of the moon. The Mysteries were
divided into four steps or Degrees. The candidate might receive the first at eight years of age, when he was invested with the zennar. Each Degree dispensed something of perfection. "Let the wretched man,"
says the Hitopadesa, "practice virtue, whenever he enjoys one of the three or four religious Degrees; let him be evenminded with all created things, and that disposition will be the source of virtue."
After various ceremonies, chiefly relating to the unity and trinity of the Godhead, the candidate was
clothed in a linen garment without a seam, and remained under the care of a Brahmin until he was twenty years of age, constantly studying and practising the most rigid virtue. Then he underwent the
severest probation for the second Degree, in which he was sanctified by the sign of the cross, which, pointing to the four quarters of the compass, was honored as a striking symbol of the Universe by many
nations of antiquity, and was imitated by the Indians in the shape of their temples. Then he was admitted to the Holy Cavern, blazing with light, where, in costly robes, sat, in the East, West, and
South, the three chief Hierophants, representing the Indian triune Deity. The ceremonies there commenced with an anthem to the Great God of Nature; and then followed this apostrophe: "O mighty
primal Creator! Eternal God of Gods! The World's Mansion! Thou art the Incorruptible Being, distinct from all things transient! Thou art before all Gods, the Ancient Absolute Existence, and the Supreme
Supporter of the Universe! Thou art the Supreme Mansion; and by Thee, O Infinite Form, the Universe was spread abroad."
The candidate, thus taught the first great primitive truth, was called upon to make a formal declaration,
that he would be tractable and obedient to his superiors; that he would keep his body pure; govern his tongue, and observe a passive obedience in receiving the doctrines and traditions of the Order; and the
firmest secrecy in maintaining inviolable its hidden and abstruse mysteries. Then he was sprinkled with water (whence our baptism); ' certain words, now unknown, were whispered in his ear; and he was
divested of his shoes, and made to go three times around the cavern. Hence our three circuits; hence we were neither barefoot nor shod: and the words were the Passwords of that Indian Degree.
The Gymnosophist Priests came from the banks of the Euphrates into Ethiopia, and brought with them
their sciences and their doctrines. Their principal College was at Meroe, and their Mysteries were celebrated in the Temple of Amun, renowned for his oracle. Ethiopia was then a powerful State, which
preceded Egypt in civilization, and had a theocratic government. Above the King was the Priest, who

could put him to death in the name of the Deity. Egypt was then composed of the Thebaid only. Middle Egypt and the Delta were a gulf of the Mediterranean. The Nile by degrees formed an immense marsh,
which, afterward drained by the labor of man, formed Lower Egypt; and was for many centuries governed by the Ethiopian Sacerdotal Caste, of Arabic origin; afterward displaced by a dynasty of
warriors. The magnificent ruins of Axiom, with its obelisks and hieroglyphics, temples, vast tombs and pyramids, around ancient Meroe, are far older than the pyramids near Memphis.
The Priests, taught by Hermosa embodied in books the occult and hermetic sciences, with their own
discoveries and the revelations of the Sibyls. They studied particularly the most abstract sciences, discovered the famous geometrical theorems which Pythagoras afterward learned from them, calculated
eclipses, and regulated, nineteen centuries before Caesar, the Julian year. They descended to practical investigations as to the necessities of life, and made known their discoveries to the people; they
cultivated the fine arts, and inspired the people with that enthusiasm which produced the avenues of Thebes, the Labyrinth, the Temples of Karnac, Denderah, Edfou, and Philae, the monolithic obelisks,
and the great Lake Morris, the fertilizer of the country.
The wisdom of the Egyptian Initiates, the high sciences and lofty morality which they taught, and their immense knowledge, excited the emulation of the most eminent men, whatever their rank and fortune;
and led them, despite the complicated and terrible trials to be undergone, to seek admission into the Mysteries of Osiris and Isis.
From Egypt, the Mysteries went to Phoenicia, and were celebrated at Tyre. Osiris changed his name,
and become Adoni or Dionysos, still the representative of the Sun ; and afterward these Mysteries were introduced successively into Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Sicily, and Italy. In Greece and Sicily,
Osiris took the name of Bacchus, and Isis that of Ceres, Cybele, Rhea and Venus.
Bar Hebraeus says: "Enoch was the first who invented books and different sorts of writing. The ancient Greeks declare that Enoch is the same as Mercury Trismegistus [Hermes], and that he taught the sons
of men the art of building cities, and enacted some admirable laws. He discovered the knowledge of the Zodiac, and the course of the Planets; and he pointed out to the sons of men, that they should worship
God, that they should fast, that they should pray, that they should give aims, votive offerings, and tenths. He reprobated abominable foods and drunkenness, and appointed festivals for sacrifices to the
Sun, at each of the 'Zodiacal Signs."
Manetho extracted his history from certain pillars which he discovered in Egypt, whereon inscriptions had been made by Thoth, or the first Mercury [or Hermes], in the sacred letters and dialect: but which
were after the flood translated from that dialect into the Greek tongue, and laid up in the private recesses of the Egyptian Temples. These pillars were found in subterranean caverns, near Thebes and

beyond the Nile, not far from the sounding statue of Memnon, it a place called Syringes; which are described to be certain winding apartments underground; made, it is said, by those who were skilled in
ancient rites; who foreseeing the coming of the deluge, and fearing lest memory of their ceremonies should be obliterated, built and contrived vaults, dug with vast labor, in several places.
From the bosom of Egypt sprang a man of consummate wisdom, initiated in the secret knowledge of
India, of Persia, and of Ethiopia, named Thoth or Phtha by his compatriots, Taaut by the Phoenicians, Hermes Trismegistus by the Greeks, and Adris by the Rabbins. Nature seemed to have chosen him for
her favorite, and to have lavished on him all the qualities necessary to enable him to study her and to know her thoroughly. The Deity had, so to say, infused into him the sciences and the arts, in order that'
he might instruct the whole world.
He invented many things necessary for the uses of life and gave them suitable names; he taught men how to write down their thoughts and arrange their speech; he instituted the ceremonies to be observed
in the worship of each of the Gods; he observed the course of the stars; he invented music, the different bodily exercises, arithmetic, medicine, the art of working in metals, the lyre with three strings; he
regulated the three tones of the voice, the sharp, taken from autumn, the grave from winter, and the middle from spring, there being then but three seasons. It was he who taught the Greeks the mode of
interpreting terms and things, whence they gave him the name of `Ee??? [Hermes], which signifies Interpreter.
In Egypt he instituted hieroglyphics: he selected a certain number of persons whom he judged fitted to
be the depositaries of his secrets, of such only as were capable of attaining the throne and the first offices in the Mysteries; he united them in a body, created them Priests of the Living God, instructed
them in the sciences and arts, and explained to them the symbols by which they were veiled. Egypt, 1500 years before the time of Moses, revered in the Mysteries One SUPREME GOD, called the ONLY
UNCREATED. Under Him it paid homage to seven principal deities, it is to Hermes, who lived at that period, that we must distribute the concealment or veiling [velation] of the Indian worship, which
Moses unveiled or revealed, changing nothing of tbe laws of Hermes, except the plurality of his mystic Gods.
The Egyptian Priests related that Hermes, dying, said: "Hitherto I have lived an exile from my true
country: now I return thither. Do not weep for me: I return to that celestial country whither each goes in his turn, There is God. This life is but a death." This is precisely the creed of the old Buddhists of
Samaneans, who believed that from time to time God sent Buddha�s on earth, to reform men, to wean them from their vices, and lead them back into the paths of virtue.
Among the sciences taught by Hermes, there were secrets which he communicated to the Initiates only

279/641
upon condition that they should bind themselves, by a terrible oath, never to divulge them, except to those who, after long trial, should be found worthy to succeed them. The Kings even prohibited the
revelation of them on pain of death. This secret was styled the Sacerdotal Art, and included alchemy, astrology, magnum [magic], the science of spirits, etc. He gave them the key to the Hieroglyphics of all
these secret sciences, which were regarded as sacred, and kept concealed in the roost secret places of the Temple.
The great secrecy observed by the initiated Priests, for many years, and the lofty sciences which they
professed, caused them to be honored and respected throughout all Egypt, which was regarded by other nations as the college, the sanctuary, of the sciences and arts. The mystery which surrounded them
strongly excited curiosity. Orpheus metamorphosed himself, so to say, into an Egyptian. He was initiated into. Theology and Physics. And he so completely made the ideas and seasonings of his
teachers his own, that his Hymns rather bespeak an Egyptian Priest than a Grecian Poet: and he was the first who carried into Greece the Egyptian fables. Pythagoras, ever thirsty for learning, consented even
to be circumcised, in order to become one of the Initiates: and the occult sciences were revealed to him in the innermost part of the sanctuary.
The Initiates in a particular science, having been instructed by fables, enigmas, allegories, and
hieroglyphics, wrote mysteriously whenever in their works they touched the subject of the Mysteries, and continued to conceal science under a veil of fictions. When the destruction by Cambyses of many
cities, and the ruin of nearly all Egypt, in the year 528 before our era, dispersed most of the Priests into Greece and elsewhere, they bore with them their sciences, which they continued to teach enigmatically,
that is to) say, ever enveloped in the obscurities of fables and hieroglyphics; to the end that' the vulgar herd, seeing, might see nothing and hearing, might comprehend nothing. All the writers drew from this
source: but these Mysteries, concealed under so many unexplained envelopes, ended in giving birth to a swarm of absurdities, which, from Greece, spread over the whole earth. In the Grecian Mysteries, as
established by Pythagoras, there were three Degrees. A preparation of five years' abstinence and silence was required. If the candidate was found to be passionate or intemperate, contentious, or ambitious of
worldly honors and distinctions, he was rejected.
In his lectures, Pythagoras taught the mathematics, as a medium whereby to prove the existence of God from observation and by means of reason; grammar, rhetoric, and logic, to cultivate and improve that
reason, arithmetic, because he conceived that the ultimate benefit of man consisted in the science of numbers, and geometry, music, and astronomy, because he conceived that man is indebted to them for a
knowledge of what is really good and useful.
He taught the true method of obtaining a knowledge of the Divine laws of purifying the soul from its imperfections, of searching for truth, and of practicing virtue; thus imitating the perfections of God. He
thought his system vain, if it did not contribute to expel vice and introduce virtue into the mind. He

280/641
taught that the two most excellent things were, to speak the truth, and to render benefits to one another particularly he inculcated Silence, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. He taught the
immortality of the soul, the Omnipotence of God, and the necessity of personal holiness to qualify a man for admission into the Society of the Gods.
Thus we owe the particular mode of instruction in the Degree of FellowCraft to Pythagoras; and that
Degree is but an imperfect reproduction of his lectures. From him, too, we have many of our explanations of the symbols. He arranged his assemblies due East and West, because he held that
Motion began in the East and proceeded to the West. Our Lodges are said to be due East and West, because the Master represents the rising Sun, and of course must be in the East. The pyramids, too,
were built precisely by the four cardinal points. And our expression. that our Lodges extend upward to the Heavens, comes from the Persian and Druidic custom of having to their Temples no roofs but the
sky.
Plato developed and spiritualized the philosophy of Pythagoras Even Eusebius the Christian admits, that he reached to the vestibule of Truth, and stood upon its threshold. The Druidical ceremonies
undoubtedly came from India; and the Druids were originally Buddhists.
The word Druid, like the word Magi, signifies wise or learned men; and they were at once philosophers, magistrates, and divines. There was a surprising uniformity in the Temples, Priests,
doctrines, and worship of the Persian Magi and British Druids. The Gods of Britain were the same as the Cabiri of Samothrace. Osiris and Isis appeared in their Mysteries, under the names of Hu and
Ceridwen; and like those of the primitive Persians, their Temples were enclosures of huge unhewn stones, some of which still remain, and are regarded by the common people with fear and veneration.
They were generally either circular or oval. Some were in the shape of a circle to which a vast serpent was attached. The circle was an Eastern symbol of the Universe, governed by an Omnipotent Deity
whose center is everywhere, and his circumference nowhere : and the egg was an universal symbol of the world. Some of the Temples were winged, and some in the shape of a cross; the winged ones
referring to Kneph, the winged SerpentDeity of Egypt ; whence the name of Navestock, where one of them stood. Temples in the shape of a cross were also found in Ireland and Scotland. The length of one
of these vast structures, in the shape of a serpent, was nearly three miles. The grand periods for initiation into the Druidical Mysteries, were quarterly; at the equinoxes and solstices. In the remote
times when they originated, these were the times corresponding with the 13th of February, 1st of May, 19th of August, and 1st of November. The time of annual celebration was MayEve, and the ceremonial
preparations commences at midnight, on the 29th of April. When the initiations were over, on MayEve, fires were kindled on all the cairns and cromlechs in the island, which burned all night to introduce the
sports of May day.
The festival was in honor of the Sun. The initiations were performed at midnight and there were three

Degrees. The Gothic Mysteries were carried Northward from the East, by Odin; who, being a great warrior, modeled and varied them to suit his purposes and the genius of his people. He placed over their
celebration twelve Hierophants, who were alike Priests, Counselors of State, and Judges from whose decision there was no appeal. He held the numbers three and nine in peculiar veneration, and was
probably himself the Indian Buddha. Every thricethree months, thricethree victims were sacrificed to the tryune God. The Goths had three great festivals; the most magnificent of which commenced at the
winter solstice, and was celebrated in honor of Thor, the Prince of the Power of the Air. That being the longest night in the year, and throne after which the Sun comes Northward, it was commemorative of
the Creation; and they termed it mothernight, as the one in which the creation of the world and light from the primitive darkness took place. This was the Yule, Jitul, or Yeof feast, which afterward became
Christmas. At this feast the initiations were celebrated. Thor was the Sun, the Egyptian Osiris and Kneph, the Physician Bel or Baal. The initiations were had in hugeintricate caverns, terminating, as all
the Mithriac caverns did, in a spacious vault, where the candidate was brought to light.
Joseph was undoubtedly initiated. After he had interpreted Pharaoh's dream, that Monarch made him his Prime Minister, let him ride in his second chariot, while they proclaimed before him, ABRSCHI
(*An Egytian word,meaning, "Bow down.") and set him over the land of Egypt. In addition to this, the King gave hid a new name, TsapanatPaanakh, and married him to Asanat, daughter of Potai Paring, a
Priest of An or Hieropolis, where was the Temple of AthomRe, the Great God of Egypt; thus completely naturalizing him. He could not have contracted this marriage, nor have exercised that high
dignity, without being first initiated in the Mysteries. When his Brethren came to Egypt the second time, the Egyptians of his court could not eat with them, as that would have been abomination, though
they ate with Joseph; who was therefore regarded not as a foreigner, but as one of themselves: and when he sent and brought his brethren back, and charged them with taking his cup, he said, "Know ye not that
a man like me practices divination?" thus assuming the Egyptian of high rank initiated into the Mysteries, sad as such conversant with the occult sciences.
So also must Moses have been initiated for he was not only brought up in the court of the King, as the
adopted son of the Kingly daughter, until he was forty years of age; but he was instructed in all the learning of the Egyptians, and married after ward the daughter of Yethru, a Priest of An likewise.
Strobo and Diodorus both assert that he was himself a Priest of Heliopolis. Before he went into the Desert, there were intimate relations between him and the Priesthood; and he had successfully
commanded, Josephus informs us, an army sent by the King against the Ethiopians. Simplicius asserts that Moses received from the Egyptians, in the Mysteries, the doctrines which he taught to the
Hebrews: and Clement of Alexandria and Philo say that he was a Theologian and Prophet, and interpreter of the Sacred Laws. Manetho, cited by Josephus, says he was a Priest of Heliopolis, and that
his true and original (Egyptian) name was Asersaph or Osarsiph.
And in the institution of the Hebrew Priesthood, in the powers and privileges, as well as the immunities and sanctity which he conferred upon them, he closely imitated the Egyptian institutions; making

public the worship of that Deity whom the Egyptian Initiates worshipped in private; and strenuously endeavoring to keep the people from relapsing into their old mixture of Chaldaic and Egyptian
superstition and idolworship, as they were ever ready and inclined to do; even Aharun, upon their first clamorous discontent, restoring the worship of Apis as an image of which Egyptian God he made the
golden calf. The Egyptian Priests taught in their great Mysteries, that there was one God, Supreme and inapproachable, who had conceived the University. His Intelligence, before He created it by His Power
and Will. They were no Materialists nor Pantheists; but taught that Matter was not eternal or coexistent with the great First Cause, but created by Him.
The early Christians, taught by the founder of their Religion, but in greater perfection, those primitive
truths that from the Egyptians had passed to the Jews, and been preserved among the latter by the Essenes, received also the institution of the Mysteries; adopting as their object the building of the
symbolic Temple, preserving the old Scriptures of the Jews as their sacred book, and as the fundamental law, which furnished the new veil of initiation with the Hebraic words and formulas, that,
corrupted and disfigured by time and ignorance, appear in many of our Degrees.
Such, my Brother, is the doctrine of the first Degree of the Mysteries, or that of chief of the Tabernacle, to which you have now been admitted, and the moral lesson of which is, devotion to the service of God,
and disinterested zeal and constant endeavor for the welfare of men. You have here received only hints of the true objects and purposes of the Mysteries. Hereafter, if you are permitted to advance, you will
arrive at a more complete understanding of them and of the sublime doctrines which they teach. Be content, therefore, with that which you have seen and heard, and await patiently the advent of the
greater light.
XXIV. PRINCE OF THE TABERNACLE
SYMBOLS were the almost universal language of ancient theology. They were the most obvious
method of instruction; for like nature herself, they addressed the understanding through the eye and the most ancient expressions denoting communication of religious knowledge, signify ocular exhibition.
The first teachers of mankind borrowed this method of instruction and it comprised an endless store of pregnant hieroglyphics. These lessons of the olden time were the riddles of the Sphynx, tempting the
curious by their quaintness, but involving the personal risk of the adventurous interpreter. "The Gods themselves," it was said, "disclose their intentions to the wise, but to fools their teaching is
unintelligible; "and the King of the Delphic Oracle was said not to declare, nor onthe other hand to conceal; but emphatically to "intimate or signify."
The Ancient Sages, both barbarian and Greek, involved their meaning in similar indirections and

283/641
enigmas ; their lessons were conveyed either in visible symbols, or in those "parables and dark sayings of old," which the Israelites considered it a sacred duty to hand down unchanged to successive
generations. The explanatory tokens employed by man, whether emblematical objects or actions, symbols or mystic ceremonies, were like the mystic signs and portends either in dreams or by the
wayside, supposed to he significant of the intentions of the Gods; both required the aid of anxious thought and skillful interpretation. It was only by a conect appreciation of analogous problems of
nature, that the will of Heaven could be understood iy the Diviner, or the lessons of Wisdom become manifest to the Sage.
The Mysteries were a series of symbols; and what was spoken there consisted wholly of accessory
explanations of the act or image; sacred commentaries, explanatory of established symbols; with little of those independent traditions embodying physical or moral speculation, in which the elements or
planets were the Sage actors and the creation!and revolutions of the world were intermingled with recollections of ancient events: and yet with so much of that also, that nature became her own expositor
through the medium of an arbitrary symbolical instruction; and the ancient views of the relation between the human and divine received dramatic forms.
There has ever been an intimate alliance between the two systems, the symbolic and the philosophical,
in the allegories of the monuments of all ages, in the symbolic writings of the priests of all nations, in the rituals of all secret and mysterious societies; there has been a constant series, an invariable
uniformity of principles, which come from an aggregate, vast imposing, and true, composed of parts that fit harmoniously only there.
Symbolical instruction is recommended by the constant and' uniform usage of antiquity, and it has
retained its influence throughout all ages, as a system of mysterious communication. The Deity, in his revelations to man, adopted the use of material images for the purpose of enforcing sublime truths; and
Christ taught by symbols and parables. The mysterious knowledge of the Druids was embodied in signs and symbols. Taliesin, describing his initiation, says: "The secrets were imparted to me by the old
Giantess (Ceridwen, or Isis), without the use of audible language." And again he says, "I am a silent proficient" Initiation was ,a school, in which were taught the truths of primitive revelation, the existence
and attributes of one God, the immortality of the Soul, rewards and punishments in a future life, the phenomena of Nature, the arts, the sciences, morality, regulation, philosophy, and philanthropy, and
what we now style psychology and metaphysics, with animal magnetism, and the other occult sciences.
All the ideas of the Priests of Hindustan, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Chaldaea, Phoenicia, were known to the Egyptian Priests. The rational Indian philosophy, after penetrating Persia and Chaldaea, gave birth to
the Egyptian Mysteries. We find that the use of Hieroglyphics was preceded in Egypt by that of the easily understood symbols and figures, from the mineral, animal, and vegetable kingdoms, used by the
Indians, Persians, and Chaldans to express their thoughts; and this primitive philosophy was the basis of

284/641
the modern philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato. All the philosophers and legislators that made Antiquity illustrious, were pupils of the initiation; and all the beneficent modifications in the religions
of the different people instructed by them were owing to their institution and extension of the Mysteries. In the chaos of popular superstitions, those Mysteries alone kept man from lapsing into
absolute brutishness. Zoroaster and Confucius drew their doctrines from the Mysteries. Clement of Alexandria, speaking of the Great Mysteries, says: "Here ends all instruction. Nature and all things are
seen and known moral truths alone been taught the Initiate, the Mysteries could never have deserved nor received the magnificent eulogiums of the most enlightened alien of Antiquity, of Pindar, Plutarch,
Isocrates, Diodorus, Plato, Euripides, Socrates, Aristophanes, Cicero, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and others; philosophers hostile to the Sacerdotal Spirit, or historians devoted to the investigation of Truth.
No, all the sciences were taught there and those oral on written traditions briefly communicated, which reached back to the first age of the world.
Socrates said, in the Phaedo of Plato: "It well appears that those who established the Mysteries, or
secret assemblies of the initiated, were no contemptible personages, but men of great genius, who in the early ages strove to teach us, under enigmas, that he who shall go to the invisible regions without being
punfied, will be precipitated into the abyss; while he who arrives there, purged of the stains of this world, and accomplished in virtue, will be admitted to the dwellingplace of the Deity. The jnitiated are
certain to attain the company of the Gods."
Pretextatus, Proconsul of Achaia, a man endowed with all the virtues, said, in the 4th century, that to deprive the Greeks of those Sacred Mysteries which bound together the whole human race, would make
life insupportable. Initiation was considered to be a mystical death; a descent into the infernal regions, where every pollution, and the stains and imperfection's of a corrupt and evil life were purged away by
fire and water; and the perfect Epopt was then said to be regenerated, newborn, restored to a renovated existence of life, light, and purity; and placed under the Divine Protection.
A new language was adapted to these celebrations, and also a language of hieroglyphics, unknown to
any but those who had received the highest Degree.
And to them ultimately were confined the learning, the morality and the political power, of every people among which the Mysteries were practiced. So effectually was the knowledge of the
hieroglyphics of the highest Degree hidden from all but a favored few, that in process of time their meaning was entirely lost, and none could interpret them. If the same hieroglyphics were employed in
the higher as in the lower Degrees, they had a different and more abstruse and figurative meaning. It was pretended, in later times, that the sacred hieroglyphics and language were the same that were used
by the Celestial Deities. Everything that could heighten the mystery of initiation was added, until the very name of the ceremony possessed a strange charm, and yet conjured up the wildest fears. ache
greatest rapture came to be expressed by the word that signified to pass through the Mysteries.

The Priesthood possessed one third of Egypt. They gained much of their influence by means of the
Mysteries, and spared no means to impress the people with a full sense of their importance. They represented them as the beginning of a new life of reason and virtue the initiated, or esoteric
companions were said to entertain the most agreeable anticipations respecting death and eternity, to comprehend all the hidden mysteries of Nature, to have their souls restored to the original perfection
from which man had fallen; and at their death to be borne to the celestial mansions of the Gods. The doctrines of a future state of rewards and punishments formed a prominent feature in the Mysteries; and
they were also believed to assure much temporal happiness and good fortune, and afford absolute security against the most imminent dangers by land and sea. Public odium was cast of those who
refused to be initiated. They were considered profane, unworthy of public employment or private confidence; and held to be doomed to eternal punishment as impious. To betray the secrets of the
Mysteries, to wear on the stage the dress of an Initiate, or to hold the Mysteries up do derision, was to incur death at the hands of public vengeance.
It is certain that up to the time of Cicero, the Mysteries still retained much of their original character of
sanctity and purity. And at a later day, as we know, Nero, after committing a horrible crime, did not dare, even in Greece, to aid in the celebration of the Mysteries; nor at a still later day was Constantine,
the Christian Emperor, allowed to do so, after his murder of his relatives.
Everywhere, and in all their forms, the Mysteries were funereal; and celebrated the mystical death and restoration to life of some divine or heroic personage: and the details of the legend and the mode of the
death varied in the different Countries where the Mysteries were practiced.
Their explanation belongs both to astronomy and mythology, and the Legend of the Master's Degree is but another form of that of the Mysteries, reaching back, in one shape or other, to the remotest
antiquity.
Whether Egypt originated the legend, or borrowed it from India or Chaldea, it is now impossible to know. But the Hebrews received the Mysteries from the Egyptians; and of course were familiar with
their legend, known as it was to those Egyptian Initiates, Joseph and Moses. It was the fable (or rather the truth clothed in allegory and figures) of Osiris, the Sun, Source of Light and Principle of good, and
Typhon, the Principle of Darkness, and Evil. In all the histories of the Gods and Heroes lay couched and hidden astronomical details and the history of the operations of visible Nature; and those in their
turn were also symbols of higher and profounder truths.
None but rude uncultivated intellects could long consider the Sun and Stars and the Powers of Nature as Divine, or as fit objects of Human Worship; and they will consider them so while the world lasts ; and

ever. remain ignorant of the great Spiritual Truths of which these are the hieroglyphics and expressions.
A brief summary of the Egyptian legend will serve to show the leading idea on which the Mysteries among the Hebrews were based. Osiris, said to have been an ancient King of Egypt, was the Sun; and
Isis, his wife, the Moon and his history recounts, in poetical and figurative style, the annual journey of the Great Luminary of Heaven through the different Signs of the Zodiac. In the absence of Osiris,
Typhon, his brother, filled with envy and malice, sought to usurp his throne; but his plans were frustrated by Isis. Then he resolved to kill Osiris. This he did,. by persuading him to enter a coffin or
sarcophagus, which he then flung into the Nile. Alter a Long search, Isis found the body, and concealed it in the depths of a forest; but Typhon, finding it there, cut it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them
hither and thither. After tedious search, Isis found thirteen pieces, the fishes having oaten the other (the privates), which she replaced of wood, and buried the body at Philae; where a temple of surpassing
magnificence was erected in honor of Osiris.
Isis, aided by her son Orus, Horus or Haroeri, warred against Typhon, slew him, reigned gloriously, and at her death was reunited to her husband, in the same tomb. Typhon was represented as born of the
earth; the upper part of his body covered with feathers, in stature reaching the clouds, his arms and legs covered with scales, serpents darting from him on every side, and fire flashing from his mouth. Horus,
who aided in slaying him, became the God of the Sun, answering to the Grecian Apollo; and Typhon is but the anagram of Python, the great serpent slain by Apollo.
The word Typhon, like Eve, signifies a serpent, and life. By its form the serpent symbolizes life, which
circulates through all nature. When, toward the end of autumn, the Woman (Virgo), in the constellations seems (upon the Chaldean sphere) to crush with her heel the head of the serpent, this
figure foretells the coming of winter, during which life seems to retire from all beings, and no longer to circulate through nature. This is why Typhon signifies also a serpent, the symbol of winter, which, in
the Catholic Temples, is represented surrounding the Terrestrial Globe, which surmounts the heavenly cross, emblem of redemption. If the word Typhon is derived from Tupoul) it signifies a tree which
produces apples (mala) evils), the Jewish origin of the fall of man. Typhon means also one who supplants, and signifies the human passions, which expel from our hearts the lessons of wisdom. In the
Egyptian Fable, Isis wrote the sacred word for the instruction of men, and Typhon effaced it as fast as she wrote it. In morals, his name signifies Pride, Ignorance and Falsehood.
When Isis first found the body, where it had floated ashore near Byblos, a shrub of Erica or tamarisk
near it had, by the virtue of the body, shot up into a tree around it, and protected it; and hence our sprig of acacia. Isis was also aided in her search by Anubis, in the shape of a dog. He was Sirius or the Dog
Star, the friend and counselor of Osiris, and the inventor of language, grammar, astronomy, surveying, arithmetic, music, and medical science; the first maker of laws; and who taught the worship of the
Gods, and the building of Temples.

In the Mysteries, the nailing up of the body of Osiris in the chest or ark was termed the aphanism) or
disappearance [of the Sun at the Winter Solstice, below the Tropic of Capricorn], and the recovery of the different parts of his body by Isis, the Euresis, or finding. The candidate went through a ceremony
representing this, in all the Mysteries everywhere. The main facts in the fable were the same in all countries; and the prominent Deities were everywhere a male and a female.
In Egypt they were Osiris and Isis; in India, Mahadeva and Bhavani; in Phoenicia, Thammuz (or
Adonis) and Astarte; in Phrygia, Atys and Cybele; in Persia, Mithras and Asis; in Samothrace and Greece, Dionysus or Sabazeus and Rhea; in Britain, Hu and Ceridwen; and in Scandinavia, Woden and
Frea; and in every instance these Divinities represented the Sun and the Moon.
The mysteries of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, seem to have been the model of all other ceremonies of initiation subsequently established among the different peoples of the world. Those of Atys and Cybele,
celebrated in Phrygia; those of Ceres and Proserpine, at Eleusis and many other places in Greece, were but copies of them. This we learn from Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, Lactantius, and other writers; and in
the absence of direct testimony should necessarily infer it from the similarity of the adventures of these Deities; for the ancients held that the Ceres of he Greeks was the same as the Isis of the Egyptians; and
Dionusos or Bacchus as Osiris.
In the legend of Osiris and Isis, as given by Plutarch, are many details and circumstances other than those that we have briefly mentioned; and all of which we need not repeat here. Osiris married his sister
Isis; and labored publicly with her to ameliorate he lot of men. He taught them agriculture, while Isis invented laws. He built temples to the Gods, and established their worship. Both were the patrons of
artists and their useful inventions and introduced the use of iron for defensive weapons and implements of agriculture, and of gold to adorn the temples of the Gods. He went forth with an army to conquer
men to civilization, teaching he people whom he overcame to plant the vine and sow grain for food.
Typhon, his brother, slew him when the sun was in the sign of the Scorpion, that is to say, at the Autumnal Equinox. They had been rival claimants, says Synesius, for the throne of Egypt, as Light and
Darkness contend ever for the empire of the world. Plutarch adds, that at the time when Osiris was slain, the moon was at its full; and therefore it was in the sign opposite the Scorpion, that is, the Bull,
the sign of the Vernal Equinox.
Plutarch assures us that it was to represent these events and details that Isis established the Mysteries, in which they were reproduced by images, symbols, and a religious ceremonial, whereby they were
imitated and in which lessons of piety were given, and consolations under the misfortunes that afflict us here below. Those who instituted these Mysteries meant to strengthen religion and console men in their

sorrows by the lofty hopes found in a religious faith, whose principles were represented to them covered by a pompous ceremonial, and under the sacred veil of allegory.
Diodorus speaks of the famous columns erected near Nysa, in Arabia, where, it was said, were two of
the tombs of Osiris and Isis. On one was this inscription: "I am Isis, Queen of this country. I was instructed by Mercury. No one can destroy the laws which I have established. I am the eldest daughter
of Saturn, most ancient of the Gods. I am the wife and sister of Osiris the King. I first made known tomortals the use of wheat. I am the mother of Orus the King. In my honor was the city of Bubaste
built. Rejoice, O Egypt, rejoice, land that gave me birth!" And on the other was this: "I am Osiris the King, who led my armies into all parts of the world, to the most thickly inhabited countries of India, the
North, the Danube, and the Ocean. I am the eldest son of Saturn; I was born of the brilliant and magnificent egg, and my substance is of the same nature as that which composes light. There is no
place in the Universe where I have not appeared, to bestow my benefits and make known my discoveries." The rest was illegible.
To aid her in the search for the body of Osiris, and to nurse her infant child Horus, Isis sought out and
took with her Anubis, son of Osiris, and his sister Nephte. He, as we have said, was Sirius, the brightest star in the Heavens. After finding him, she went to Byblos, and seated herself near a fountain; where
she had learned that the sacred chest had stopped which contained the body of Osiris. There she sat, sad and silent, shedding a torrent of tears.
Thither came the women of the Court of Queen Astarte, and she spoke to them, and dressed their heir,
pouring upon it deliciously perfumed ambrosia. This known to the Queen, Isis was engaged as nurse for her child, in the palace, one of the columns of which was made of the Erica or tamarisk, that had grown
up over the chest containing Osiris, cut down by the King, and unknown to him, still enclosing the chest: which column Isis afterward demanded, and from it extracted the chest and the body, which, the
latter wrapped in thin drapery and perfumed, she carried away with her.
Blue Masonry, ignorant of its import, still retains among its emblems one of a woman weeping over a broken column, holding in her hand a branch of acacia, myrtle, or tamarisk, while Time, we are told,
stands behind her combing out the ringlets of her hair. We need not repeat the vapid and trivial explanation there given, of this representation of Isis, weeping at Byblos, over the column torn from the
palace of the living, that contained the body of Osiris, while Horus, the God of Time, pours ambrosia on her hair.
Nothing of this recital was historical; but the whole was an allegory or sacred fable, containing a
meaning known only to those who were initiated into the Mysteries. All the incidents were astronomical, with a meaning still deeper lying behind that explanation, and so hidden by a double veil.

The Mysteries in which these incidents were represented and explained, were like those of Eleusis in their object, of which Pausanias, who was initiated, says that the Greeks, from the remotest antiquity,
regarded them as the best calculated of all things to lead mental piety and Aristotle says they were the most valuable of all religious instillations, and thus were called mysteries par excellence and the Temple
of Eleusis was regarded as, in some sort, the common sanctuary of the whole earth, where religion had brought together all that was most imposing and most august.
The object of all the Mysteries was to inspire men with piety, and to console them in the miseries of
life. That consolation, so afforded, was the hope of a happier future, and of pasting, after death, to a state of eternal felicity. Cicero says that the Initiates not only received lessons which made life more
agreeable, but drew from the ceremonies happy hopes for the moment of death.
Socrates says that those who were so fortunate as to be admitted to the Mysteries, possessed, when dying, the most glorious hopes for eternity. Aristides says that they not only procure the Initiates
consolations in the present life, and means of deliverance from the great weight of their evils, but also the precious advantage of passing after death to a happier state.
Isis was the Goddess of Sais and the famous Feast of Lights was celebrated there in her honor. There
were celebrated the Mysteries, in which were represented the death and subsequent restoration to life of the God Osiris, in a secret ceremony and scenic representation of his sufferings, called the Mysteries of
Night.
The Kings of Egypt often exercised the functions of the Priesthood and they were initiated into the sacred science as soon as they attained the throne. So at Athens, the First Magistrate, or ArchonKing,
superintended the Mysteries.' This was an image of the union that existed between the Priesthood and Royalty, in those early times when legislators and kings sought in religion a potent political instrument.
Herodotus says, speaking of the reasons why animals were deified in Egypt: "If I were to explain these
reasons, I should be led to the disclosure of those holy matters which I particularly wish to avoid, and which, but from necessity, I should not leave discussed at all." So he says, "The Egyptians have at Sais
the tomb of a certain personage, whom I do not think myself permitted to specify. It is behind the Temple of Minerva." [The latter, so called by the Greeks, was really Isis, whose was the often cited
enigmatical inscription, "I am what was and is and is to come. No mortal hath yet unveiled me."] So again he says: "Upon this lake are represented by night the accidents which happened to him whom I
dare not name. The Egyptians call them their Mysteries.
Concerning these, at the same time that I confess myself sufficiently informed, I feel myself compelled to be silent. Of the ceremonies also in honor of Ceres I may not venture to speak, further than the

obligations of religion will allow me."
It is easy to see what was the great object of initiation and the Mysteries; whose first and greatest fruit was, as all the ancients testify, to civilize savage hordes, to soften their ferocious manners, to introduce
among them social intercourse, and lead them into a way of life more worthy of men. Cicero considers the establishment of the EIeusian Mysteries to be the greatest of all the benefits conferred by Athens on
other commonwealths; their effects having been, he says, to civilize men, soften their savage and ferocious manners, and teach them the true principles of morals, which initiate man into the only kind
of life worthy of him. The same philosophic orator, in a passage where he apostrophizes Ceres and Proserpine, says that mankind owes these Goddesses the first elements of moral life, as well as the first
means of sustenance of physical life; knowledge of the laws, regulation of morals, and those examples of civilization which have improved the manners of men and cities.
Bacchus in Euripides says to Pentheus, that his new institution (the Dionysian Mysteries) deserved to be
known, and that one of its great advantages was, that it prescribed all impurity: that these were the Mysteries of Wisdom, of which it would be imprudent to speak to persons not initiated: that they were
established among the Barbarians, who in that showed greater wisdom than the Greeks, who had not yet received them.
This double object, political and religious, one teaching our duty to men, and the other what we owe to
the Gods; or rather, respect for the Gods calculated to maintain that which we owe the laws, is found in that wellknown verse of Virgil, borrowed by him from the ceremonies of initiation: "Teach me to
respect Justice and the Gods." This great lesson, which the Hierophant impressed on the Initiates, after they had witnessed a representation of the Infernal regions, the Poet places after his description of the
different punishments suffered by the wicked in Tartarus, and immediately after the description of that of Sisyphus.
Pausanias, likewise, at the close of the representation of the punishments of Sisyphus and the daughters
of Danaus, in the Temple at Delphi, makes this reflection; that the crime or impiety which in them had chiefly merited this punishment, was the contempt which they had shown for the Mysteries of Eleusis.
From this reflection of Pausanias, who was an Initiate, it is easy to see that the Priests of Eleusis, who
taught the dogma of punishment in Tartarus, included among the great crimes deserving these punishments, contempt for and disregard of the Holy Mysteries; whose object was to lead men to piety,
and thereby to respect for justice and the laws, chief object of their institution, if not the only one, and to fvhich the needs and interest of religion itself were subordinate; since the latter was but a means to
lead more surely to the foyer; for the whole force of religious opinions being in the hands of the legislators to be wielded, they were sure of being better obeyed.

The Mysteries were not merely simple illustrations and the observation of some arbitrary formulas and
ceremonies; nor a means of reminding men of the ancient condition of the race prior to civilization: but they led men to piety by instruction in morals and as to a future life; which at a very early day, if not
originally, formed the chief portion of the ceremonial.
Symbols were used in the ceremonies, which referred to agriculture, as Masonry has preserved the ear of wheat in a symbol and in one of her words; but their principal reference was to astronomical
phenomena. Much was no doubt said as to the condition of brutality and degradation in which man was sunk before the institution of the Mysteries; but the allusion was rather metaphysical, to the ignorance
of the uninitiated, than to the wild life of the earliest men.
The great object of the Mysteries of Isis, and in general of all the Mysteries, was a great and truly politic one. It was to ameliorate our race, to perfect, its manners and morals, and to restrain society by
stronger bonds than those that human laws impose. They were the invention of that ancient science and wisdom which exhausted all its resources to make legislation perfect; and of that philosophy which has
ever sought to secure the happiness of man, by purifying his soul from the passions which can trouble it, and asia necessary consequence introduce social disorder. And that they were the work of genius is
evident from their employment of all the sciences, a profound knowledge of the human heart, and the means of subduing it.
It is a still greater mistake to imagine that they were the inventions of charlatanism, and means of
deception. They may in the lapse of time have degenerated into imposture and schools of false ideas; but they were not so at the beginning; or else the wisest and best men of antiquity have uttered toe most
willful falsehoods. In process 0f time the very allegories of the Mysteries themselves, Tantalus and its punishments, Minos and the other judges of the dead. came to be misunderstood, and to be false
because they were so; while at first they were true, because they were recognized as merely the arbitrary forms in which truths were enveloped.
The object of the Mysteries was to procure for man a real felicity on earth by the means of virtue; and
to that end he was taught that his soul was immortal; and that error, sin, and vice must needs, by an inflexible law, produce their consequences. The rude representations of physical torture in Tantalus was
but an image of, the certain, unavoidable, eternal consequences that flow by the law of God's enactment from the sin committed and the vice indulged in. The poets and mystagogues labored to propagate these
doctrines of the soul's immortality and the certain punishment of sin and vice, and to accredit them with the people, by teaching them the former in their poems, and the latter in the sanctuaries; and they
clothed them with the charms, the one of poetry, and the other of spectacles and magic illusions.

They painted, aided by all the resources of art, the virtuous man's happy life after death, and the horrors of the frightful prisons destined to punish the vicious. In the shades of the sanctuaries, these delights
and horrors were exhibited as spectacles, and the Initiates witnessed religious dramas, under the name of initiation and mysteries. Curiosity was excited by secrecy, by tie difficulty experienced in obtaining
admission, and by the tests to be undergone. The candidate was amused by the variety of the scenery, the pomp of the decorations, the appliances of machinery. Respect was inspired by the gravity and
dignity of the actors and the majesty of the ceremonial and fear and hope, sadness and delight, were in turns excited.
The Hierophants, men of intellect, and well understanding the disposition of the people and the art of
controlling them, used every appliance to attain that object, and give importance and impressiveness to their ceremonies. As they covered those ceremonies with the veil of Secrecy, so they preferred that
Night, should cover them with its wings. Obscurity adds to impressiveness, and assists illusion; and they used it to produce an effect upon the astonished Initiate. The ceremonies were conducted in
caverns dimly lighted; thick groves were planted around the Temples, to produce that gloom that impresses the mind with a religious awe.
The very word mystery, according to Demetrius Phalereus, was a metaphorical expression that denoted
the secret awe which darkness and gloom inspired. The night was almost always the time fixed for their celebration; and they were ordinarily termed nocturnal ceremonies. Initiations into the Mysteries of
Samothrace tookplace at night; as did those of Isis, of which Apuleius speaks.
Euripides makes Bacchus say, that his Mysteries were celebrated at night, because there is in night something august and imposing. Nothing excites men's curiosity so much as Mystery, concealing things
which they desire to know and nothing so much increases curiosity as obstacles that interpose to prevent them frown indulging in the gratification of their desires. Of this the Legislators and
Hierophants took advantage, to attract the people to their sanctuaries, and to induce them to seek to obtain lessons from which they would perhaps have turned away with indifference, if they had been
pressed upon them. In this spirit of mystery they professed to imitate the Deity who hides Himself from our senses, and conceals from us the springs by which He moves the Universe.
They admitted that they concealed the highest truths under the veil of allegory, the more to excite the
curiosity of men, and to urge them to investigation. The secrecy in which they buried their Mysteries, had that end.
Those to whom they were confided, bound themselves, by the most fearful oaths, never to reveal them.
They were not allowed even to speak of these important secrets with any others than the initiated ; and the penalty of death was pronounced against any one indiscreet enough to reveal them, or found in the

Temple without being an Initiate; and any one who had betrayed those secrets, was avoided by all, as excommunicated.
Aristotle was accused of impiety, by the Hierophant Eurymendon, for having sacrificed to the manes of
his wife, according to the rite used in the worship of Ceres. He was compelled to flee to Chalcis; and to purge his memory from this stain, he directed, by his will, the erection of a Statue to that Goddess.
Socrates, dying, sacrificed to Esculapius, to exculpate himself from the suspicion of Atheism. A price
was set on the head of Diagoras because he had divulged the Secret of the Mysteries. Andocides was accused of the same crime, as was Alcibiades, and both were cited to answer the charge before the
inquisition at Athens, where the People were the Judges. Aeschylus the Tragedian was accused of having represented the Mysteries on the stage and was acquitted only on proving that he had never been
initiated.
Seneca, comparing Philosophy to initiation, says that the most sacred ceremonies could be known to the adapts alone but that man of their precepts were known even to the Profane. Such was the case with the
doctrine of a future life, and a state of rewards and punishments beyond the grave. The ancient legislators clothed this doctrine in the pomp of a mysterious ceremony, in mystic words and magical
representations, to impress upon the mind the truths they taught, by the strong influence of such scenic displays upon the senses and imagination.
In the same way they taught the origin of the soul, its fall to the earth past the spheres and through the
elements, and its final return to the place of its origin, when, during the continuance of its union with earthly matter, the sacred fire, which formed its essence, had contracted no stains, and its brightness
had not been marred by foreign particles, which, denaturalizing it, weighed it down and delayed its return. These metaphysical ideas, with difficulty comprehended by the mass of the Initiates, were
represented by figures, by symbols, and by allegorical analogies; no idea being so abstract that men do not seek to give it expression by, and translate it into, sensible images.
The attraction of Secrecy was enhanced by the difficulty of obtaining admission. Obstacles and
suspense redoubled curiosity. Those who aspired to the initiation of the Sun and in the Mysteries of Mathias in Persia, underwent many trials. `they commenced by easy tests and arrived by degrees at
those that were most cruel, in which the life of the candidate was often endangered. Gregory Nazianzen terms them tortures and mystic punishments. No one call be initiated, says Suidas, until after he has
proven, by the most terrible trials, that he possesses a virtuous soul, exempt from the sway of every passion, and at it were impassible. There were twelve principal tests and some make the number larger.
The trials of the Eleusinian initiations were not so terrible; but they were severe and the suspense,

above all in which the aspirant was kept for several years [the memory of which is retained in Masonry by the ages of those of the different Degrees], or the interval between admission to the inferior and
initiation in the great Mysteries, was a species of torture to the curiosity which it was desired to excite. Thus the Egyptian Priests tried Pythagoras before admitting him to know the secrets of the sacred
science. He succeeded, by his incredible patience and the courage with which he surmounted all obstacles, in obtaining admission to their society and receiving their lessons. Among the Jews, the
Essenes admitted none among them, until they had passed the tests or several Degrees.
By initiation, those who before were fellowcitizens only, became brothers, connected by a closer bond than before, by means of a religious fraternity, which, bringing men nearer together, united them more
strongly and the weak and the poor could more readily appeal for assistance to the powerful and the wealthy, with whom religious association gave them a closer fellowship.
The Initiate was regarded as the favorite of the Gods. For him alone Heaven opened its treasures.
Fortunate during life, he could, by virtue and the favor of Heaven, promise himself after death an eternal felicity.
The Priests of the Island of Samothrace promised favorable winds and prosperous voyages to those who
wer initiated. It was promised them that the CABIRI, and Castor and Pollux, the Dioscuri, should appear to them when the storm raged, and give them calms and smooth seas and the Scholiast of
Aristophanes says that those initiated in the Mysteries there were just men, who were privileged to escape from great evils and tempests.
The Initiate in the Mysteries of Orpheus, after he was purified, was considered as released from the
empire of evil, and transferred to a condition of life which gave him the happiest hopes. "I have emerged from evils he was made to say, "and have attained good." Those initiated in the Mysteries of
Eleusis believed that the Sun blazed with a pure splendor for them alone. And, as we see in the case of Pericles, they flattered themselves that Ceres and Proserpine inspired them and gave them wisdom and
counsel.
Initiation dissipated errors and banished misfortune and after having filled the heart of man with joy during life, it gave him the most blissful hopes at the moment of da We owe it to the Goddesses of
Eleusis, says Socrates, that we do not lead the wild life of the earliest men and to them are due the flattering hopes which initiation gives us for the moment of death and for all eternity. The benefit
which we reap from these august ceremonies, says Aristides, is not only present joy, a deliverance and enfranchisement from the old ills; but also the sweet hope which we have in death of passing to a more
fortunate state. And Theon says that participation of the Mysteries is the finest of all things, and the source of the greatest blessings. The happiness promised there was not limited to this mortal life; but it

extended beyond the grave. There a new life was to commence, during which the Initiate was to enjoy a bliss without alloy and without limit. The Corybantes promised eternal life to the Initiates of the
Mysteries of Cybele and Atys.
Apuleius represents Lucius, while still in the form of an ass, as addressing his prayers to Isis, whom be speaks of as the same as Ceres, Venus, Diana, and Proserpine, and as illuminating the walls of many
cities simultaneously with her feminine lustre, and substituting her quivering light for the bright rays of the Sun. She appears to him in his vision as a beautiful female, "over whose divine neck her long thick
hair hung in graceful ringlets" Addressing him, she says, "The parent of Universal nature attends thy call. The mistress of the Elements, initiative germ of generations, Supreme of Deities, Queen of
departed spirits, first inhabitant of Heaven, and uniform type of all the Gods and Goddesses, propitiated by thy prayers, is with thee. She governs with her nod the luminous heights of the firmament, the
salubrious breezes of the ocean; the silent deplorable depths of the shades below; one Sole Divinity under many forms, worshipped by the different nations of the Earth under many titles, and with various
a religious rites."
Directing him how to proceed, at her festival, to reobtain his human shape, she says: "Throughout the entire course of the remainder of thy life, until the very last breath has vanished from thy lips, thou art
devoted to my service Under my protection will thy life be happy and glorious and when, thy days being spent, thou shall descend to the shades below, and inhabit the Elysian fields, there also, even in the
subterranean hemisphere, shall thou pay frequent worship fo me, thy propitious patron and yet further if through sedulous obedience, religious devotion to my ministry, and inviolable chastity, thou shall prove
thyself a worthy object of divine favor, then shall thou fell the influence of the power that I alone possess. The number of thy days shall be prolonged beyond the ordinary decrees of fate." In the
procession of the festival, Lucius saw the image of the Goddess, on either side of which were female attendants, that, "with ivory combs in their hands, made believe, by the motion of their arms and the
divesting of their fingers, to comb and ornament the Goddess' royal hair." Afterward, clad in linen robes, came the initiated, "The hair of the women was moistened by perfume, and enveloped in a
transparent covering; but the men, terrestrial stars, as it were, of the great religion, were thoroughly shaven, and their bald heads shone exceedingly." Afterward came the Priests, in robes of white linen.
The first bore a lamp in the form of a boat, emitting flame from an orifice in the middle; the second, a small altar; the third, a golden palmtree; and the fourth displayed the figure of a left hand, the palm
open and expanded, "representing thereby a symbol of equity and fair dealing, of which the left hand, as slower than the right hand, and more void of skill and craft, is therefore an appropriate emblem."
After Lucius had, by the grace of Isis, recovered his human form, the Priest said to him, "Calamity hath
no hold on those whom our Goddess hath chosen for her service, and whom her majesty hath vindicated." And the people declared that he was fortunate to be "thus after a manner born again, and at
once betrothed to the service of the Holy Ministry."

When he urged the Chief Priest to initiate him, he was answered that there was not "a single one among the initiated, of a mind so degraded, or so bent on his own destruction, as without receiving a special
command from Isis, to dare to undertake her ministry rashly and sacrilegiously, and thereby commit an act certain to bring upon himself a dreadful injury." For, continued the Chief Priest, the gates of the
shades below, and the care of our life being in the hands of the Goddess, the ceremony of initiation into the Mysteries is, as it were, to suffer death, with the precarious chance of resuscitation. Wherefore the
Goddess, in the wisdom of her divinity, hath been accustomed to select as persons to whom the secrets of her religion can with propriety be entrusted, those who, standing as it were on the utmost limit of the
course of life they have completed, may through her Providence be in a manner born again, and commence the career of a new existence." When he was finally to be initiated, he was conducted to the
nearest baths, and after having bathed, the Priest first solicited forgiveness of the Gods, and then sprinkled him all over with the clearest and purest water, and conducted him back to the Temple;
"where," says Apuleius, "after giving me some instruction, that mortal tongue is not permitted to reveal, he bade me for the succeeding ten days restrain my appetite, eat no animal food, and drink no wine."
These ten days elapsed, the Priest led him into the inmost recesses of the Sanctuary. "And here,
studious reader," he continues "peradventure thou wilt be suffciently anxious to know all that was said and done, which, were it lawful to divulge, I would' tell thee; and, wert thou permitted to hear, thou
shouldst know. Nevertheless, although the disclosure would affix the penalty of rash curiosity to my tongue as well as thy ears, yet will I, for fear thou shouldst be too long tormented with religious
longing, and suffer the pain of protracted suspense, tell the truth notwithstanding. Listen then to what I shall relate.
I approached the abode of death; with my foot I pressed the threshold of Proserpine's Palace. I was
transported through the elements, and conducted back again. At midnight I saw the bright light of the sun shining. I stood in the presence of the Gods, the Gods of Heaven and of the Shades below; ay, stood
clear and worshipped. And now have I told thee such things that, hearing, thou necessarily canst not understand; and being beyond the comprehension of the Profane, I can enunciate without committing a
crime." After night had passed, and the morning had dawned, the usual ceremonies were at an end. Then he was consecrated by twelve stoles being put upon him, clothed, crowned with palmleaves, and
exhibited to the people. The remainder of that day was celebrated as his birthday and passed in festivities; and on the third day afterward, the same religious ceremonies were repeated, including a
religious breakfast, "followed by a final consummation of ceremonies."
A year afterward, he was warned to prepare. for initiation into the Mysteries of "the Great God, Supreme Parent of all the other Gods, the invincible Osiris." "For," says Apuleius, "although there is a
strict connection between the religions of both Deities, AND EVEN THE ESSENCE OF BOTH DIVINITIES IS IDENTICAL, the ceremonies of the respective initiations are considerably different."

Compare with this hint the following language of the prayer of Lucius, addressed to Isis ; and we may judge what doctrines were taught in the Mysteries, in regard to the Deity: "O Holy and Perpetual
Preserver of the Human Race ! ever ready to cherish mortals by Thy munificence, and to afford Thy sweet maternal affection to the wretched under misfortune; Whose bounty is never at rest, neither by
day nor by night, nor throughout the very minutest particle of duration; Thou who stretchest forth Thy healthbearing right hand over the land and over the sea for the protection of mankind, to disperse the
storms of life, to unravel the inextricable entanglement of the web of fate, to mitigate the tempests of fortune, and restrain the malignant infilences of the stars, the Gods in Heaven adore Thee, the Gods in
the shades below do Thee homage, the stars obey Thee, the Divinities rejoice in Thee, the elements and the revolving seasons serve Thee! At Thy nod the Winds breathe, clouds gather, seeds grow, buds
germinate; in obedience to Thee the Earth revolves AND THE SUN GIVES US LIGHT. IT IS THOU WHO GOVERNEST THE UNIVERSE AND TREADEST TARTARUS UNDER THY FEET."
Then he was initiated into the nocturnal Mysteries of Osiris and Serapis; and afterward into those of
Ceres at Rome; but of the ceremonies in these initiations, Apuleius says nothing. Under the Archonship of Euclid, bastards and slaves were excluded from initiation; and the same exclusion obtained against
the Materialists or Epicureans who denied Providence and consequently the utility of initiation. By a natural progress, it came at length to be considered that the gates of Elysium would open only for the
Initiates, whose souls had been purified and regenerated in the sanctuaries. But it was never held, on the other hand, that initiation alone sufficed. We learn from Plato, that it was also necessary for the soul
to be purified from every stain; and that the purification necessary was such as gave virtue, truth, wisdom, strength, justice, and temperance.
Entrance to the Temples was forbidden to all who had committed homicide, even if it were involuntary.
So it is stated by both Isocrates and Theon. Magicians and Charlatans who made trickery a trade, and impostors pretending to be possessed by evil spirits, were excluded from the sanctuaries. Every impious
person and criminal was rejected; and Lampridius states that before the celebration of the Mysteries, public notice was given, that none need apply to enter but those against whom their consciences uttered
no reproach, and who were certain of their own innocence.
It was required of the Initiate that his heart and hands should be free from any stain. Porphyry says that man's soul, at death, should be enfranchised from all the passions, from hate, envy, and the others; and
in a word, be as pure as it is required to be in the Mysteries. Of course it is not surprising that parricides and perk jurors, and others who had committed crimes against God or man, could not be admitted.
In the Mysteries of Mithras, a lecture was repeated to the Initiate on the subject of Justice. And the
great moral. Lesson of the Mysteries, to which all their mystic ceremonial tended, expressed in a single line by Virgil, was to practice Justice and revere the Deity, thus recalling men to justice, by connecting
it with the justice of the Gods, who require it and punish its infraction. The Initiate could aspire to the

favors of the Gods, only because and while he respected the rights of society and those of humanity. "The sun," says the chorus of Initiates in Aristophanes, "burns with a pure light for us alone, who,
admitted to the' Mysteries, observe the laws of piety in our intercourse with strangers and our fellow citizens." The rewards of initiation were attached to the practice of the, social virtues. It was not enough
to be initiated merely. It was necessary to be faithful to the laws of initiation, which imposed on men duties in regard to their kind. Bacchus allowed none to participate in his Mysteries, but men who
performed to the rules of piety and justice. Sensibility, above all, and compassion for the misfortunes of others, were precious virtues, which initiation strove to encourage. "Nature," says Juvenal "has created
us compassionate, since it has endowed us with tears.
Sensibility is the most admirable of our senses. What man is truly worthy of the torch of the Mysteries; who such as the Priest of Ceres requires him to be, if he regards the misfortunes of others as wholly
foreign to himself?"
All who had not used their endeavors to defeat a conspiracy, and those who had on the contrary fomented one; those citizens who had betrayed their country, who had surrendered an advantageous
post or place, or the vessels of the State, to the enemy; all who had supplied the enemy with money; and in general, all who had come short of their duties as honest men and good citizens, were excluded from
the Mysteries of Eleusis. To be admitted there, one must have lived equitably, and with suffcient good fortune not to be regarded as hated by the Gods.
Thus the Society of the Initiates was, in its principle, and according to the true purpose of its institution,
a society of virtuous men, who labored to free their souls from the tyranny of the passions, and to develop the germ of all the social virtues, And this was the meaning of the idea, afterward
misunderstood, that entry into Elysium was only allowed to the Initiates because entrance to the sanctuaries was allowed to the virtuous only, and Elysium was created for virtuous souls alone.
The precise nature and details of the doctrines as to a future life, and rewards and punishments there,
developed in the Mysteries, is in a measure uncertain. Little direct information in regard to it has corme down to us. No doubt, in the ceremonies, there was a scenic representation of Tantalus and the
judgment of the dead, resembling that which we find in Virgil: but there is as little doubt ihat these representations were explained to be allegorical. It is not our purpose here to repeat the descriptions
given We are only concerned with the great fact that the Mysteries taught the doctrine of the soul's immortality, and that, in some shape, suffering, pain, remorse, and agony, ever follow sin as its
consequences.
Human ceremonies are indeed but imperfect symbols and the alternate baptisms in fire and in water intended to purify us into immortality, are ever in, this world interrupted at the moment of their

anticipated completion. Life its a mirror which reflects only to deceive, a tissue perpetually. Interrupted and broken, an urn forever fed, yet never full.
All initiation is but introductory to the great change of death. Baptism, anointing, embalming,
obsequies by burial or fire, are preparatory symbols, like the initiation of Hercules before descending to the Shades, pointing out the mental change which ought to precede the renewal of existence. Death is
the true initiation, to which sleep is the introductory or minor mystery. It is the final rite which united the Egyptian with his God, and which opens the same promise to all who are duly prepared for it.
The body was deemed a prison for the soul; but the latter was not condemned to eternal banishment and
imprisonment. The Father of the Worlds permits its chains to be broken, and has provided in the course of Nature the means of its escape. It was a doctrine of immemorial antiquity, shared alike by Egyptians,
Pythagoreans, the Orphici, and by that characteristic Bacchus Sage, "the Preceptor of the Soul," Silence, that death is far better than life; that the real death belongs to those who on earth are immersed
in the Lethe of its passions and fascinations, and that the true life commences only when the soul is emancipated for its return.
And in this sense, as presiding over life and death, Dionysus is in the highest sense the LIBERATOR.
Since, like Osiris, he frees the soul, and guides it in its migrations beyond the grave, preserving it from the risk of again falling under the slavery of matter or of some inferior animal form, the purgatory of
Metempsychosis; and exalting and perfecting its nature through the purifying discipline of his Mysteries. "The great consummation of all philosophy," said Socrates, professedly quoting from
traditional and mystic sources, "is Death: He who pursues philosophy aright, is studying how to die."
All soul is part of the Universal Soul, whose totality is Dionysus; and it is therefore he who, as Spirit of Spirits, leads back the vagrant spirit to its home, and accompanies it through the purifying processes,
both real and symbolical, of its earthly thansit. He is therefore emphatically the Mystic or Hierophant, the great Spiritual Mediator of Greek religion.
The human soul is itself demonios a God withers the mind, capable through its own power of rivaling
the canonization of the Hero, of making itself immortal by the practice of the good, and the contemplation of the beautiful and true.
The removal to the Happy Islands could only be understood mythically; everything earthly must die;
Man, like OEdipus, is wounded from his birth, his realm elysium can exist only beyond the grave. Dionysus died and descended to the shades. His passion was the great Secret of the Mysteries; as Death
is the Grand Mystery of existence. His death, typical of Nature's Death, or of her periodical decay and restoration, eras one of the many symbols of the palingenesia or second birth of man.

Man descended from the elemental Forces or Titans [Elohim], who fed on the body of the Pantheistic
Deity creating the Universe by selfsacrifice, commemorates in sacramental observance this mysterious passion; and while partaking of the raw flesh of the victim, seems to be invigorated by a fresh draught
from the fountain of unversal life, to receive a new pledge of regenerated existence. Death is the inseparable antecedent of life; the seed lies in order to produce the plant, and earth ishelf is rent asunder
and dies at the birth of Dionusos. Hence the significancy of the phallus, or of its inoffensive substitute, the obelisk, rising as an emblem of resurrection by the tomb of buried Deity at Lerna or it Sais.
DionysusOrpheus descended to the Shades to recover the lost Virgin of the Zodiac, to bring back his
mother to the sky as Thyone; or what has the same meaning, to consummate his eventful marriage with Persephone, thereby securing, like the nuptials of his father with Semele or Danae, the perpetuity of
Nature.
His underearth office is the depression of the year, the wintry aspect in the alternations of bull and serpent, whose united` series makes up the continuity of Time, and in whirls, physically speaking, the
stash and dark are ever the parents of the beautiful and bright.
The Mysteries, the human sufferer was consoled by witnessing the severer trials of the Gods; and the vicissitudes of life and death, expressed by apposite symbols, such as the sacrifice or submission of the
Bull, the extinction and reillumination of the torch, excited corresponding emotions of alternate grief and joy, that play of passion which was present at the origin of Nature, and which accompanies all her
changes.
The greater Eleusiniae were celebrated in the month Boedromion, when the seed was buried in the ground, and when the year, verging to its decline, disposes the mind to serious reflection. The first days
of the ceremonial were passed in sorrow and anxious silence, in fasting and expiatory or lustral offices. On a sudden, the scene was changed sorrow and lamentation were discarded, the glad name of Bacchus
passed from mouth to mouth, the image of the God, crowned with myrtle and bearing a lighted torch, was borne in, joyful procession from the Ceramicus to Eleusis, where, during thee ensuing night, the
initiation was completed by an imposing revelation. The first scene was in the paonaos, or outer court of the sacred enclosure, where amidst utter darkness, or while the meditating God, the star illuminating
the Nocturnal Mystery, alone carried an unextinguished torch, the candidates were overawed with terrific sounds and noises, while they painfully groped their way, as in the gloomy cavern of the soul's
sub lunar migration; a scene justly compared to the passage of the Valley of the Shadow of Death. For by the immutable law exemplified in the trials of Psyche, man must pass through the terrors of the
underworld, before he can reach the height of Heaven. At length the gates of the adytum were thrown open, a supernatural light streamed from the illuminated statue of the Goddess, and enchanting sights
and sounds, mingled with songs and dances, exalted the communicant to a rapture of supreme felicity,

realizing, as far as sensuous imagery could depict, the anticipated reunion with the Gods.
In the dearth of direct evidence as to the detail of the ceremonies enacted, or of the meanings connected with them, their tendency must be inferred from the characteristics of the contemplated deities with
their accessory symbols and mythi, or from direct testimony as to the value of the Mysteries generally. The ordinary phenomena of vegetation, the death of the seed in giving birth to the plant, connecting the
sublimest hopes with the plainest occurrences, was the simple yet beautiful formula assumed by the great mystery in almost all religions, from the ZendAvesta to the Gospel. As Proserpine, the divine
power is as the seed decaying and destroyed; as Artemis, she is the principle of its destruction; but Artemis Proserpine is also Core Soteria, the Saviour, who leads the Spirits of Hercules and Hyacinthus
to Heaven. Many other emblems were employed in the Mysteries, as the dove, the myrtlewreath, and others, all significant of life rising out of death, and of the equivocal condition of dying yet immortal
man.
The horrors and punishments of Tantalus, as described in the Phaedo and the AEneid, with all the ceremonies of the judgments of Minos, Eacus, and Rhadamanthus, were represented, sometimes more
and sometimes less fully, in the Mysteries; in order to impress upon the minds of the Initiates this great lesson, that we should be ever prepared to appear before the Supreme Judge, with a heart pure and
spotless; as Socrates teaches in the Gorgias. For the soul stained with crimes, he says, to descend to the Shades, is the bitterest ill. To adhere to Justice and Wisdom, Plato holds, is our duty, that we may some
day take that lofty road that leads toward the heavens, and avoid most of the evils to which the soul is exposed in its subterranean journey of a thousand years. And so in the Phaedo, Socrates teaches that we
should seek here below to free our soul of its passions, in order to be ready to enter our appearance, whenever Destiny summons us to the Shades.
Thus the Mysteries inculcated a great moral truth, veiled with a fable of huge proportions and the
appliances of an impressive spectacle, to which exhibited in the sanctuaries art and natural magic lent all they had that was imposing.
They sought to strengthen men against the horrors of death and the fearful idea of utter annihilation.
Death, says the author of the dialogue, entitled Axiochus, included in the works of Plato, is but a passage to a happier state; but one must have lived well, to attain that most fortunate result. So that the
doctrine of the immortality of the soul was consoling to the virtuous and religious man alone; while to all others it came with menaces and despair, surrounding them with terrors and alarms that disturbed
their repose during all their life.
For the material horrors of Tantalus, allegorical to the Initiate, were real to the mass of the Profane ; nor in latter times, did, perhaps many Initiates read rightly the allebaory. The triplewalled prison, which

the condemned soul first met, round which swelled and surged the fiery waves of Phlegethon, wherein rolled roaring, huge, blazing rocks; the great gate with columns of adamant, which none save the Gods
could crush; Tisiphone, their warder, with her bloody robes; the lash resounding on the mangled bodies of the miserable unfortunates, their plaintive groans, mingled in horrid 'harmony with the clashing of
their chains; the Furies, lashing the guilty with their snakes; the awful abyss where Hydra howls with its hundred heads, greedy to devour; Tityus, prostrate, and his entrails fed upon by the cruel vulture;
Sisyphus, ever rolling his rock; Ixion on his wheel; Tantalus tortured by eternal thirst and hunger, in the midst of water and with delicious fruits touching his head; the daughters, of Danaus at their eternal,
fruitless task; beasts biting and venomous reptiles stinging; and devouring flame eternally consuming bodies ever renewed in endless agony; all these sternly impressed upon the people the terrible
consequences of sin and vice, and urged them to pursue the paths of honesty and virtue.
And if, in the ceremonies of the Mysteries, these material horrors were explained to the Initiates as mere symbols of the unimaginable torture, remorse, and agony that would rend the immaterial soul and
rack the immortal spirit, they were feeble and insufficient in the same mode and measure only, as all material images and symbols fall short of that which is beyond the cognizance of our senses and the
grave Hierophant, the imagery, the paintings, the dramatic horrors, the funeral sacrifices, the august rnysteries, the solemn silence of the sanctuaries, were none the less impressive, because they were
known to be but symbols, that with material shows and images made the imagination to be the teacher of the intellect, expiation; and the tests of water, air, and flre were represented; by means of which,
during the march of many years, the soul could be purified, and rise toward the ethereal regions; that ascent being more or less tedious and laborious, according as each soul was more or less clogged by the
gross impediments of its sins and vices. Herein was shadowed forth, (how distinctly taught the Initiates we know not), the doctrine that pain and sorrow, misfortune and remorse, are the inevitable
consequences that flow from sin and vice, as effect flows from cause; that by each sin and every act of vice the soul drops back and loses ground in its advance toward perfection and that the ground so, lost
is and will be in reality never so recovered as that the sin shall be as if it never had been committed; but that throughout all the eternity of its existence', each soul shall be conscious that every act of vice or
baseness it did on earth has made the distance greater between itself and ultimate perfection.
We see this truth glimmering in the doctrine, taught in the Mysteries, that though slight and ordinary offences could be expiated by penances, repentance, acts of beneficence, and prayers, grave crimes
were mortal sins, beyond the reach of all such remedies. Eleusis closed her gates against Nero and the Pagan Priests told Constantine that among all their modes of expiation there was none so potent as
could wash from his soul the dark spots left by the murder of his wife, and his multiplied perjuries and assassinations.
The object of the ancient initiations being to ameliorate mankind and to perfect the intellectual part of
man, the nature of the human soul, its origin, its destination, its relations to the body and to universal nature, all formed part of the mystic science and to them in part the lessons given to the Initiate were

directed. For it was believed that initiation tended to his perfection, and to preventing ,the divine part within him, overloaded with, matter gross and earthy, from being plunged into gloom, and impeded in
its return to the Deity. The soul, with them, was not a mere conception or abstraction; but a reality including in itself life and thought; or, rather, of whose essence it was to live and think. It was material;
but not brute, inert, inactive, lifeless, motionless, formless, lightless matter. It was held to be active, reasoning, thinking; its natural home in the highest regions of the Universe, whence it descended to
illuminate, give form and movement to, vivify, animate, and carry with itself the baser matter and whither it unceasingly tends to reascend, when and as soon as it can free itself from its connection with
that matter. From that substance, divine, infinitely delicate and active, essentially luminous, the souls of men were formed, and by it alone, uniting with and organizing their bodies, men lived.
This was the doctrine of Pythagoras, who learned it when he received the Egyptian Mysteries : and it
was the doctrine of all who, by means of the ceremonial of initiation, thought to purify the soul. Virgil makes the spirit of Archives teach it to AEneas: and all the expiations and lustrations vised in the
Mysteries were but symbols of those intellectual olies by which the soul was to be purged of its vice spots and stains, and freed of the encumbrance of its earthly prison, so that it might rise unimpeded to
the source from which it came.
Hence sprung the doctrine of the transmigration of souls; which Pythagoras taught as an allegory, and those who came after him received literally. Plato, like him, drew his doctrines from the East and the
Mysteries, and undertook to translate the language of the symbols used there, into that of Philosophy; and to prove by argument and philosophical deduction, what felt by the consciousness, the Mysteries
taught by Symbols as an indisputable fact, the immortality of the soul. Cicero did the same; and followed the Mysteries in teaching that the Gods were but mortal men, who for their great virtues and
signal services had deserved that their souls should, after death, be raised to that lofty rank.
It being taught in the Mysteries, either by way of allegory, the meaning of which was not made known except to a select few, or, perhaps only at a later day, as an actual reality, that the souls of the vicious
dead passed into the bodies of those animals to whose nature their vices had most affinity, it was also taught that the soul could avoid these transmigrations, often successive and numerous, by the practice
of virtue, which would acquit it of thrum, free it from the circle of successive generations, and restore it at once to its source. Hence nothing was so ardently prayed far by the Initiates, says Proclus, as this
happy fortune, which, delivering them from the empire of Evil, would restore them to their true life, and conduct them to the place of final rest. To this doctrine probably referred those figures of animals and
monsters which were exhibited to the Initiate, before allowing him to see the sacred light for which he sighed. Plato says, that souls will not reach the term of their ills, until the revolutions of the world have
restored them to their primitive condition, and purified them from the stains which they have contracted by the contagion of fire, earth, and air. And he held that they could not be allowed to enter Heaven,
until they had distinguished themselves by the practice of virtue in some one of three several bodies. The Manicheans allowed five: Pindar, the same. number as Plato; as did the Jews. And Cicero says, that

304/641
the ancient soothsayers, and the interpolators of the will of the Gods, in their religious ceremonies and initiations, taught that we expiate here below the crimes committed in a prior life ; and for that are born.
It was taught in these Mysteries, that the soul passes' through several states, and that the pains and sorrows of this life are an expiation of prior faults.
This doctrine of transmigration of souls obtained, as Porphyry informs us, among the Persians and
Magi. It was held in the East and the West, and that from the remotest antiquity. Herodotus found, it among the Egyptians, who made the term of the circle of migrations from one human body, through
animals, fishes, and birds, to another human body,' three thousand years. Empedocles even held that souls went into plants. Of these, the laurel was the noblest, as of animals the lion; both being
consecrated to the Sun, to which, it was held in the Orient, virtuous souls were to return. The Curds, the Chinese, the Cabbalists, all held the same doctrine. So Origin held, and the Bishop Synesius, the latter
of whom had been initiated, and who thus prayed to God: "O Father, grant that my soul, reunited to the light, may not be plunged again into the defilements of earth," So the Gnostics held; and even the
Disciples of Christ inquired if the man who was born blind, was not so punished for some sin that he had committed before his birth.
Virgil, in the celebrated allegory in which he develops the doctrines taught in the Mysteries, enunciated
the doctrine, held by" most of the ancient philosophers, of the preexistence of `souls, in the eternal fire from which they emanate; that fire which animates the stars, and circulates in every part of Nature and
the purifications of the soul, by fire, water, and air, of which he speaks, and which three modes were employed in the Mysteries of Bacchus, were symbols of the passage of the soul into different bodies.
The relations of the human soul with the rest of nature were a chief object of the science of the
Mysteries. The man was there brought face to face with entire nature, The world, and the spherical envelope that surrounds it, were represented by a mystic egg, by the side of the image of the SunGod
whose Mysteries were celebrated. The famous Orphic egg was consecrated to Bacchus in his Mysteries. It was, says Plutarch, an image of the Universe, which engenders everything, and contains everything in
its bosom. "Consult," says Macrobius, "the Initiates of the? Mysteries of Bacchus, who honor with special veneration the sacred egg." The rounded and almost spherical form of its shell, he says, which
encloses it on every side, and confines within itself the principles of life, is a symbolic image of the world and the world is the universal principle of all things.
This symbol was borrowed from the Egyptians, who also consecrated the egg to Osiris, germ of Light,
himself born, sans Diodorus, from that famous egg. In Thebes, in Upper Egypt, he was represented as emitting it from his mouth, and causing to issue from it the first principle of heat and light, or the Fire
God, Vulcan, or Phtha. We find this egg even in Japan, between the horns of the famous Mithriac Bull, whose attributes Osiris, Apis, and Bacchus all borrowed.

305/641
Orpheus, author of the Grecian Mysteries, which he carried from Egypt to Greece, consecrated this symbol : and taught that matter, untreated and informers, existed from all eternity, unorganized, as
chaos; containing in itself the Principles of all Existences confused and intermingled, light with darkness, the dry with the humid, heat with cold; from which, it after long ages seeking the shape of an
immense egg, issued the purest matter, or First substance, and the residue was divided into the four elements, from which proceeded heaven and earth and all things else. This Grand Cosmogonic idea he
taught in the Mysteries; and thus the Hierophant explained the meaning of the mystic egg, seen by the initiates in the Sanctuary.
Thus entire Nature, in her primitive organization, was presented to him whom it was wished to instruct
in her secrets and initiate in her mysteries; and Clement of Alexandria might well say that initiation was a real physiology.
So Phanes, the LightGod, in the Mysteries of the New Orphics, emerged from the egg of chaos: and
the Persians had the great egg of Ormuzd. And Sanchoniathon tells us that in the Phoenician theology, the matter of chaos took the form of an egg; and he adds: "Such, are the lessons which the Son of
Thabion first Hierophant of the Phoenicians, turned into allegories, in which physics and astronomy intermingled, and which he taught to the other Hierophants, whose duty it was to preside at orgies and
initiations and who, seeking to excite the astonishment and admiration of mortals, faithfully transmitted these things to their successors and the Initiates."
In the Mysteries was also taught the division of the Universal Cause into an Active and a Passive cause;
of which two, Osiris and Isis, the heavens and the earth were symbols. These two First Causes, into which it was held that the great Universal First Cause at the beginning of things divided itself, were the
two great Divinities, whose worship was, according to Varro, inculcated upon the Initiates at Samothrace. "As is taught," he says, "in the initiation into the Mysteries at Samothrace, Heaven and
Earth are regarded as the two first Divinities. They are the potent Gods worshipped in that Island, and whose names are consecrated in the books of our Augurs. One of them is male and the other female;
and they bear the same relation to each other as the soul does to the body, humidity to dryness." The Curates, in Crete, had built an altar to Heaven and to Earth; whose Mysteries they celebrated at
Gnossus, in a cypress grove.
These two Divinities, the Active and Passive Principles of the Universe, were commonly symbolized by the generative pasts of man and woman; to which, in remote ayes, no idea of indecency was attached;
the Phallus and Cteis, emblems of generation and production, and which, as such, appeared in the Mysteries. The Indian Lingam was the union of both, as were the boat and mast and the point within a
circle all of which expressed the same philosophical idea as to the Union of the two great Causes of Nature, which concur, one actively and the other passively, in the generation of all beings; which were
symbolized by what we now term Gemini, the Twos, at that remote period when the Sun was in that

306/641
Sign at the Vernal Equinox, and when they were Male and Female; and of which the Phallus was perhaps taken from the generative organ of the Bull, when about twentyfive hundred years before our
era he opened that equinox, and became to the Ancient World the symbol of the creative and generative Power.
The Initiates at Eleusis, commenced, Process says, by invoking the two great causes of nature, the
Heavens and the Earth, on which in succession they fixed their eyes, addressing to each a prayer. And they deemed it their duty to do so, he adds, because they saw in them the Father and Mother of all
generations.
The concourse of these two agents of the Universe was termed in theological language a marriage. Tertullian, accusing the Valentinians of having borrowed these symbols from the Mysteries of Eleusis,
yet admits that in those Mysteries they were explained in a manner consistent with decency, as representing the powers of nature. He was too little of a philosopher to comprehend the sublime
esoteric meaning of these embalms, which will, if you advance, in other Degrees be unfolded to you.
The Christian Fathers contented themselves with reviling and ridiculing the use of these emblems. But as they in the earlier' times created no indecent ideas, and were worn alike by the most innocent youths
and virtuous women, it will be far wiser for us to seek to penetrate their meaning. Not only the Egyptians, says Diodorus Sinuous, but every other people that consecrate this symbol (the Phallus),
deem that they thereby do honor to the Active, Force of the universal generation of all living things. For the same reason, as we learn from the geographer Ptolemy, it was revered among the Assyrians and
Persians.
Proclus remarks that, in the distribution of the Zodiac among she twelve great Divinities, by ancient astrology, six signs were assigned to the male and six to the female principle.
There is another division of nature, which has in all ages struck all men, and which was not forgotten in
the Mysteries; that of Light and Darkness, Day and Night, Good and Evil; which mingle with, and clash against, and pursue or are pursued by eaeh other throughout the Universe. The Great Symbolic Egg
distinctly reminded the Initiates of this great division of the world.
Plutarch, treating of the dogma of a Providence, and of that of the two principles of Light and Darkness, which he regarded as the basis of the Ancient Theology, of the Orgies and the Mysteries, as
well among the Greeks as the Barbarians, a doctrine whose origin, according to him, is lost in the night of time, cites, in support of his opinion, the famous Mystic Egg of the disciples of Zoroaster and the
Initiates in the Mysteries of Mithras.

To the Initiates in the Mysteries of Eleusis was exhibited the spectacle of these two principles, in the
successive scenes of Darkness and Light which passed before their eyes. To the profoundest darkness, accompanied with illusions and horrid phantoms, succeeded the most brilliant light, whose splendor
blazed round the statue of the Goddess. The candidate, says Dion Chrysostomus, passed into a 'mysterious temple, of astonishing magnitude and beauty, where were exhibited to him many mystic
scenes; where his ears were stunned with many voices; and where Darkness and Light successively passed before him. And Themistius in like manner describes the Initiate, when about to enter into that
part of the sanctuary tenanted by the Goddess, as filled with fear and religious awe, wavering, uncertain in what direction to advance through the profound darkness that envelopes him. But when the
Hierophant has opened the entrance to the inmost sanctuary, and removed the robe that hides the Goddess, he exhibits her to the Initiate, resplendent with divine light.
The thick shadow and gloomy atmosphere which had enthroned the candidate vanish; he is filled with a
vivid and glowing enthusiasm, that lifts his soul out of the profound dejection in which it was, plunged and the purest light succeeds to the thickest darkness.
In a fragment of the same writer, preserved by Stobaeus, we learn that the Initiate, up to the moment
when his initiation is to be consummated, is alarmed by every kind of sight: that astonishment and terror take his soul captive; he trembles; cold sweat flows from his body; until the moment when the
Light is shown him, a most astoundihg Light, the brilliant scene of Elysium, where he sees charming meadows overarched by a clear sky, and festivals celebrated by dances ; where he hears harmonious
voices, and the majestic chants of the Hierophants; and views the sacred spectacles. Then, absolutely free, and enfranchised from the dominion of all ills, he mingles with the crowd of Initiates, and,
crowned with flowers, celebrates with them the holy orgies,' in the brilliant realms of ether, and the dwellingplace of Ormuzd.
In the Mysteries of Isis, the candidate first passed through the dark valley of the shadow of death; then
into a place representing the elements or sublunary world, where the two principles clash and contend; and was finally admitted to a luminous region, where the sun, with his most brilliant light, put to rout
the shades of night. Then he himself put on the costume of the
SunGod, or the Visible Source o'f Ethereal Light, in whose Mysteries he was initiated; and passed
from the empire of darkness to that of light. After having set his feet on the threshold of the palace of Pluto, he ascended to the Empyrean, to the bosom of the Eternal Principle of Light of the Universe,
from which all souls and intelligences emanate.
Plutarch admits that this theory of two Principles was the basis of all the Mysteries, and consecrated in the religious ceremonies and Mysteries of Greece. Osiris and Typhon, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Bacchus

and the Titans and Giants, all represented these principles. Phanes, the luminous God that issued from the Sacred Egg, and Night, bore the scepters in the Mysteries of the New Bacchus.
Night and Day were two of the eight Gods adored in the Mysteries of Osiris. The sojourn of Proserpine
and also of Adonis, during six months of each year in the upper world, abode of light, and six months in the lower or abode of darkness, allegorically represented the same division of the Universe.
The connection of the different initiations with the Equinoxes which separate the Empire of the Nights
from that of the Days, and fix the moment when one of these principles begins to prevail over the other, shows that the Mysteries referred to the continual contest between the two principles of light and
darkness, each alternately victor and vanquished. The very object proposed by them shows that their basis was the theory of the two principles and their relations with the soul. "We celebrate the august
Mysteries of Ceres and Proserpine," says the Emperor Julian, "at the Autumnal Equinox, to obtain of the Gods that the soul may not experience the malignant action of the Power, of Darkness that is then
about to have sway and rule in Nature." Sallust the Philosopher makes almost the same remark as to the relations of the soul with the periodical march of light and darkness, during an annual revolution; and
assures us that the mysterious festivals of Greece related to the same. And in all the explanations given by Macrobius of the Sacred Fables in regard to the sun, adored under the names of Osiris, Horus,
Adonis, Atys, Bacchus, etc. We invariably see that they refer to the theory of the two Principles, Light and Darkness, and the triumphs gained by one over the other. In April was celebrated the first triumph
obtained by the light of day over the length of the nights and the ceremonies of mourning and rejoicing had, Macrobius says, as their object the vicissitudes of the annual administration of the world.
This brings us naturally to the tragic portion of these religious scenes, and to the allegorical history of
the different adventures of the Principle, Light, victor and vanquished by turns, in the combats waged with Darkness during each annual period. Here we reach the most mysterious part of the ancient
initiations, and that most interesting to the Mason who laments the death of his Grand Master KhirOm. Over it Herodotus throws the august veil of mystery and silence.
Speaking of the Temple of Minerva, or of that Isis who was styled the Mother of the SunGod, and
whose Mysteries were termed Isiac, at Sais, he specks of a Tomb in the Temple, in the rear of the Chapel and against the well and says, "It is the tomb of a man, whose name respect requires me to
conceal. Within the Temple were great obelisks of stone [phalli], and a circular lake paved with stones and revetted with a parapet. It seemed to me as large as that at Delos" [there the Mysteries of Apollo
were celebrated]. "In this lake the Egyptians celebrate, during the night, what they style the Mysteries, in which are represented the sufferings of the God of whom I have spoken above." This God was Osiris,
put to death by Typhon, and who descended to the Shades and was restored to life; of which he had spoken before.

We are reminded, by this passage, of the Tomb of KhirOm, his death, and his rising from the grave, symbolical of restoration of life and also of the brazen Sea in the Temple at Jerusalem. Herodotus adds:
"I impose upon myself a profound, silence in regard to these Mysteries, with most of which I am acquainted. As little will I speak of the initiations of Ceres, known among the Greeks as Thesmophoria.
What I shall say will not violate the respect which I owe to religion."
Athenagoras quotes this passage to show that not only the Statue but the Tomb of Osiris was exhibited in Egypt, and a tragic representation of his sufferings; and remarks that the Egyptians had mourning
ceremonies in honor of their Gods, whose deaths they, Lamented; and to whom they afterward sacrificed as having It is, however, not difficult, combining the different rays of light that emanate from
the different Sanctuaries, to learn the genius and the object of these secret ceremonies. We have hints, and not details.
We know that the Egyptians worshipped the Sun, under the name of Osiris. The misfortunes and
tragical death of this God . were an allegory relating to the Sun. Typhon, like Ahriman, represented Darkness. The sufferings and death of Osiris in the Mysteries of the Night were a mystic image of the
phenomena of Nature, and the conflict of the two great Principle which share the empire of Nature, and most infilenced our souls. the sun is neither born, dies, nor is raised to life: and the recital of these
events was but an allegory, veiling a higher truth Horus, son of Isis, and the same as Apollo or the Sun, also died and was restored again to, life~ and to his mother; and the priests, of Isis celebrated these
great events by mourning and joyous festival succeeding each other.
In the Mysteries of Phoenicia, established in honor of Thammuz or Adonis, also the Sun, the spectacle of his death and resurrection was exhibited to the Initiates. As we learn from Meursius and Plutarch, a
figure was exhibited representing the corpse of a young man. Flowers were strewed upon his body, the women mourned for him; a tomb was erected to him. And these feasts, as we learn from Plutarch and
Ovid, passed into Greece.
God was lamented, and his resurrection was celebrated with the most enthusiastic expressions of joy. A corpse, we learn from Julian, was shown the Initiates, representing Mithras dead; and afterward his
resurrection was announced; and they were then invited to rejoice that the dead God was restored to life, and had by means of his sufferings secured their salvation. Three months before, his birth had been
celebrated, under the emblem of an infant, born on the 25th of December, or the eighth day before the Calends of January.
In Greece, in the mysteries of the same God, honored under the name of Bacchus, a representation was
given of his death, slain by the Titans; of his descent into hell, his subsequent resurrection, and his return toward his Principle or the pure abode whence he had descended to unite himself with matter. In

the islands of Chios and Tenedos, his death was represented by the sacrifice of a man, actually immolated.
The mutilation and sufferings of the same SunGod, honored in Phrygia under the name of Atys, caused
the tragic scenes that were, as we learn from Diodorus Siculus, represented annually in the Mysteries of Cybele, mother of the Gods. An image was borne there, representing the corpse of a young man, over
whose tomb tears were shed, and to whom funeral honors were paid.
At Samothrace, in the Mysteries of the Cabiri or great Gods, a representation was given of the death of one if them. This name was given to the Sun, because the Ancient Astronomers gave the name of Gods
Cabiri, and of Samothrace to the two Gods in the Constellation Gemini; whom others term Apollo and Hercules, two names of the Sun. Athenion says that the young Cabirus so slain was the same as the
Dionysus or Bacchus of the Greeks. The Pelasgi, ancient inhabitants of Greece, and who settled Samothrace, celebrated these Mysteries, whose origin is unknown and they worshipped Castor and
Pollux as patrons of navigation.
The tomb of Apollo was at Delphi, where his body was laid, after Python, the Polar Serpent that annually heralds the coming of autumn, cold, darkness, and winter, had slain him, and over whom. the
God triumphs, on the 25th of March, on his return to the lamb of the Vernal Equinox.
In Crete, Jupiter Ammon, on the Sun in Aries, painted with the attributes of that equinoctial sign, the Ram or Lamb; that Ammon who, Martianus Copella says, is the same as Osiris, Adoni, Adonis, Atys,
and the other SunGods, had also a tomb, and a religious initiation; one of the principal ceremonies of which consisted in clothing the Initiate with the skin of a white lamb. And in this we see the origin of
the apron of white sheepskin, used in Masonry. All these deaths and resurrections, these funeral emblems, these anniversaries of mourning and joy, these cenotaphs raised in different places to the
SunGod, honored under different names, had but a single object, the allegorical narration of the events which happened here below to the Light of Nature, that sacred fire from which our souls were deemed
to emanate, warring with matter and the dark Principle resident therein, ever at variance with the Principle of Good and Light poured upon itself by the Supreme Divinity. All these Mysteries, says
Clement of Alexandria, displaying to us murders and tombs alone, all these religious tragedies, had a common basis, variously ornamented and that basis was the fictitious death and resurrection of the Sun,
Soul of the World, principle of life and movement in the Sublunary World, and source of our intelligences, which are but a portion of the Eternal Light blazing in that Star, their chief center.
It was in the Sun that Souls, it was said, were purified and to it they repaired. It was one of the gates of
the soul, through which the theologians, says Porphyry, say that it reascends toward the home of Light and the Good. Wherefore, in the Mysteries of Eleusis, the Dadoukos (the first officer after the

Hierophant, who represented the Grand Demiourgos or Maker of the Universe), who was casted in the interior of the Temple, and there received the candidates, represented the Sun.
It was also held that the vicissitudes experienced by the Father of Light had an influence on the destiny
of souls; which, of the same substance as he, shared his fortunes. This we learn from the Emperor Julian and Sallust the Philosopher. They are afflicted when he suffers: they rejoice when he triumphs
over the Power of Darkness which opposes his sway and hinders the happiness of Souls, to whom nothing is so terrible as darkness. The fruit of the sufferings of the God, father of light and $ouls,
slain.by the Chief of the Powers of Darkness, and again restored to life, was received in the Mysteries. "His death works your Salvation; "said the High Priest of Mithras. That was the great secret of this
religious tragedy, and its expected fruit; the resurrection of a God, who, repossessing Himself of His dominion over Darkness, should associate with Him in His triumph those virtuous Souls that by their
purity were worthy to share His glory and that strove not against the divine force that drew them to Him, when, He had thus conquered.
To the Initiate were also displayed the spectacles of the chief agents of the Universal Cause, and of the
distribution of the world, in the detail of its parts arranged in most regular order. The Universe itself supplied man with the model of the first Temple reared to the Divinity. The arrangement of the Temple
of Solomon, the symbolic ornaments which formed its chief decorations, and the dress of the High Priest, all as Clement of Alexandria, Josephus and Philo state, had reference to the order of the world.
Clement informs us that the Temple contained many emblems of the Seasons, the Sun, the Moon, the planets, the constellations Ursa Major and Minor, the zodiac, the elements, and the other parts of the
world.
Josephus, in his description of the High Priest's Vestments, protesting against the charge of impiety brought against the He brews by other nations, for condemning the Heathen Divinities, declares it false,
because, in the construction of the Tabernacle, in the vestments of the Sacrificers, and in the Sacred vessels, the whole World was in some sort represented. Of the three parts, he says, into which the
Temple was divided, two represent Earth and Sea, open to all men, and the third, Heaven, God's dwellingplace, reserved for Him alone. The twelve loaves of Shewbread signify the twelve months of
the year.
The Candlestick represented the twelve signs through which the Seven Planets run their courses; and the seven lights, those planets; the veils, of four colors, the four elements; the tunic of the High Priest,
the earth; the Hyacinth, nearly blue, the Heavens; the aphid, of four colors, the whole of nature; the gold, Light; the breastplate, in the middle, this earth in the center of the world; the two Sardonyxes,
used as clasps, the Sun and Moon; and the twelve precious stones of the breastplate arranged by threes, like the Seasons, the twelve months, and the twelve signs of the zodiac. Even the loaves were arranged
in two groups of six, like the zodiacal signs above and below the Equator, Clement, the learned Bishop

312/641
of Alexandria and Philo, adopt all these explanations.
Hermes calls the Zodiac, the Grent Tent, Tabernaculum. In the Royal Arch Degree of the American Rite, the Tabernacle has four veils, of different colors, to each of which. Belongs a banner. the colors of
the four are White, Blue, Crimson, and Purple, and the banners bear the images of the Bull, the Lion, the Man, ant the Eagle, the Constellations answering 2500 years before our era to the Equinoctial and
Solstitial points to which belong four stars, aldebaran, Regulus, Fomalhaut, and Antares. At each of these veils there are three words : and to each division of the Zodiac, belonging to each of these Stars,
are three Signs. The four signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius, were termed the fixed signs, and are appropriately assigned to the four veils.
So the Cherubim, according to Clement and Philo, represented the two hemispheres; their wings, the
rapid course of the firmament, and of time which revolves in the Zodiac. "For the Heavens fly" says Philo, speaking of the wings of the Cherubim which were winged representations of the Lion, the Bull,
the Eagle, and the Man; of two of which, the humanheaded, winged bulls and lions, so many have been found at Nimrod; adopted as beneficent symbols, when the Sun entered Taurus at the Vernal Equinox
and Leo at the Summer Solstice and when also, he entered Scorpio, far which, on account of its malignant influences, Aquila, the eagle was substituted, at the autumnal equinox; and Aquarius (the
waterbearer) at the Winter Solstice.
So, Clement says, the candlestick with seven branches represented the seven planets, like which the seven branches were arranged and regulated, preserving that musical proportion and system of harmony
of which the sun was the centre and connection. They were arranged, says Philo, by threes, like the planets above and those below the sun; between which two groups was the branch that represented him,
the mediator or moderator of the celestial harmony. He is, in fact, the fourth in the musical scale, as Philo remarks, and Martianus Capella in his hymn to the Sun.
Near the candlestick were other emblems representing the heavens, earth and the vegetative matter out
of whose bosom the vapors arise. The whole temple was an abridged image of the world. There were candlesticks with four branches, symbols of the elements and the seasons; with twelve, symbols of the
signs; and even with three hundred and sixty, the number of days in the year, without the supplementary days. Imitating the famous Temple of Tyre, where were the great columns consecrated to the winds and
fire, the Tyrian artist placed two columns of bronze at the entrance of the porch of the temple. The hemispherical brazen sea, supported by four groups of bulls, of three each, looking to the four cardinal
points of the compass, represented the bull of the Vernal Equinox, and at Tyre were consecrated to Astarte; to whom Hiram, Josephus says, had built a temple, and who wore on her head a helmet bearing
the image of a bull. And the throne of Solomon, with bulls adopting its arms, and supported on lions, like those of Horus in Egypt and of the Sun at Tyre; likewise referred to the Vernal Equinox and
Summer Solstice. Those who in Thrice adored the sun, under the name of Saba Zeus, the Grecian

Bacchus, blinded to him, says Macrobius, a temple on Mount Zelmisso, its round form representing the world and the sun. A circular aperture in the roof admitted the light, and introduced the image of the
sun into the body of the sanctuary, where he seemed to blaze as in the heights of Heaven, and to dissipate the darkness within that temple which was a representation symbol of the world. There the
passion, death, and resurrection of Bacchus were represented.
So the Temple of Eleusis was lighted by a window in the roof. The sanctuary so lighted, Dion compares to the Universe, from which he says it differed in size alone; and in it the great lights of nature played a
great part and were myopically represented. The images of the Sun, Moon, and Mercury were represented there, (the latter the same as Anubis who accompanied Isis); and they are still the three
lights of a Masonic Lodge; except that for Mercury, the Master of the Lodge has been absurdly substituted.
Eusebius names as the principal Ministers in the Mysteries of Eleusis, first, the Hierophant, clothed
with the attributes of the Grand Architect (Demiourgos) of the Universe. After him came the Dadoukos, or torchbearer, representative of the Sun then the altarbearer, representing the Moon: and last, the
Hieroceryx, bearing the caduceus, and representing Mercury. It was not permissible to reveal the different emblems and the mysterious pageantry of initiation to the Profane; and therefore we do not
know the attributes, emblems, and ornaments of these and other officers of which Apuleius and Pausanias dared not speak.
We know only that everything recounted there was marvelous; everything done there tended to astonish
the Initiate: and that eyes and ears were equally astounded. The Hierophant, of lofty height, and noble features, with long hair, of a great age, grave and dignified, with a voice sweet and sonorous, sat upon a
throne, clad in a long trailing robe; as the MotiveGod of Nature was held to be enveloped in His work and hidden under a veil which no mortal can raise. Even his name was concealed, like that of the
Demiourgos, whose name was ineffable.
The Dadoukos also wore a long robe, his hair long and a bandeau on his forehead. Callias, when holding that office, fighting on the great day of Marathon, clothed with the insignia of his office, was
taken by the Barbarians to be a King. The Dadoukos led the procession of the Initiates, and was charged with the purification.
WE do set know the functions of the Epibomos or assistant at the altar, who represented the moon. That
planet was one of the two homes of souls, and one of the two great gates by which they descended and reascended. Mercury was charged with the conducting of souls through the two great gates; and in
going from the sun to the moon they passed immediately by him. He admitted or rejected them as they were more or less pure, and therefore the Hieroceryx or Sacred Herald, who represented Mercury, was

314/641
charged with the duty of excluding the Profane from the Mysteries.
The same offsets are found in the procession of Initiates of Isis, described by Apuleius. All clad in robes of white linen, drawn tight across the breast, and closefitting down to the very feet, came, first,
one bearing a lamp in the shape of a boat; second, one carrying an altar; and third, one carrying a golden palmtree and the caduceus. These are ihe same as the three officers at Eleusis, after the
Hierophant. Then one carrying an open hand, and pouring milk on the ground from a golden vessel in the shape of a woman's breast. The hand was that of justice: and the milk alluded to the Galaxy or
Milky Way, along which souls descended and remounted. Two others followed, one bearing a winnowing fan, and the other a watervase; symbols of the purification of souls by air and water; and
the third purification, by earth, was represented by animage of the animal that cultivates it, the cow or ox, borne by another officer.
Then followed a chest or ark, magnificently ornamented, containing an image of the organs of
generation of Osiris, or perhaps of both sexes; emblems of the original generating and producing Powers. When Typhon, said the Egyptian fable, cut up the body of Osiris into pieces, he flung his
genitals into the Nile, where a fish devoured them. Atys mutilated himself, as his Priests afterward did in imitation of him; and Adonis was in that part of his body wounded by the boar: all of which
represented the loss by the Sun of his vivifying and generative power, when he reached the Autumnal Equinox (the Scorpion that on old monuments bites those parts of the Vernal Bull), and descended
toward the region of darkness and Winter.
Then, says Apuleius, came "one who carried in his bosom an object that rejoiced the heart of the bearer, a venerable effigy of the Supreme Deity, neither bearing resemblance to man, cattle, bird, beast,
or any living creature an exquisite invention, venerable from the novel originality of the fashioning; a wonderful, ineffable symbol of religious mysteries, to be looked upon in profound silence. Such as it
was, its figure was that of a small urn of burnished gold, hollowed very, artistically, rounded at the bottom, and covered all over the outside with the wonderful hieroglyphics of the Egyptians. The spout
was not elevated, but extended laterally, projecting like a long rivulet; while on the opposite side was the handle, which, with similar lateral extension, bore on its summit an asp, curling its body into folds
and stretching upward, its wrinkled, scaly, swollen throat."
The salient basilisk or royal ensign of the Pharaohs, often occurs on the monumentsa serpent in folds, with his head raised erect above the folds. The basilisk was the Phoenix of the serpenttribe and the
vase or urn was probably the vessel, shaped like a cucumber, with a projecting spout, out of which, on the monuments of Egypt, the priests are represented pouring streams of the Cruz ansasta or Tau Cross,
and of scepters, over the kings.

In the Mysteries of Mithras, a sacred cave, representing the whole arrangement of the world, was used for the reception of the Initiates. Zoroaster, says Eubulus, first introduced this custom of consecrating
caves. They were also consecrated, in Crete, to Jupiter; in Arcadia, to, the Moon and Pan and in the Island of Naxos, to Bacchus. The Persians, in the cave where the Mysteries of Mithras were celebrated,
fixed the seat of that God, Father of Generation, or Demiourgos, near the equinoctial point of Spring, with the Northern portion of the world on his right, and the Southern on his left.
Mithras, says Porphyry, presided over the Equinoxes, seated on a Bull the symbolical animal of the
Demiourgos, and bearing a sword. The equinoxes were the gates through which souls passed to and fro, between the hemisphere of light and that of darkness. The milky way was also represented, passing near
each of these gates and it was, in the old theology, termed the pathway of souls. It is, according to Pythagoras, vast troops of souls that form that luminous belt. The route followed by souls, according to
Porphyry, or rather their progressive march in the world, lying through the fixed stars and planets, the Mithriac cave not only displayed the zodiacal and other constellations, and marked gates at the four
equinoctial and Solstitial points of the zodiac, whereat souls enter into and escape from the world of generational and through which they pass to and fro between the realms of light and darkness; but it
represented the seven planetary spheres which they needs must traverse, in descending from the heaven of the fixed stars to the elements that envelop the earth and seven gates were marked, one for each
planet, through which they pass, in descending or returning.
We learn this from Celsus in Origen; who says that the symbolical image of this passage among the stars, used in the Mithriac Mysteries, was a ladder, reaching from earth to Heaven, divided into seven
steps or stages, to each of which was a gate, and at the summit an eighth, that of the fixed stars. The first gate, says Celsus, was that of Saturn, and of lead, by the heavy nature
whereof his dull slow progress was symbolized. The second, of tin, was that of Venus, symbolizing her soft splendor and easy flexibility. The third, of brass, was that of Jupiter, emblem of his solidity and dry
nature. The fourth, of iron, was that of Mercury, expressing his indefatigable activity and sagacity.
The fifth, of copper, was that of Mars, expressive of his inequalities and variable nature. The sixth, of silver, was that of the Moon and the seventh, of gold, that of the Sun. This order is not the real order, of
these Planet's but a mysterious one, like that of the days of the Week consecrated to them, commencing with Saturday, and retrograding to Sunday. It was dictated, Celsus says, by certain harmonic relations,
those of the fourth.
Thus there was an intimate connection between the Sacred Science of the Mysteries, and ancient astronomy and physics; and the grand spectacle of the Sanctuaries was that of the order of the renown
Universe, or the spectacle of Nature itself, surrounding the soul of the Initiate, as it surrounded it when it first descended through the planetary gates, and by the equinoctial and Solstitial doors, along the
Milky Way, to be for the first time immured in its prisonhouse of matter. But the Mysteries also

represented to the candidate, by sensible symbols, the invisible forces which move this visible Universe, and the virtues, qualities, and powers attached to matter, and which maintain the marvellous order
observed therein. Of this Porphyry informs us.
The world, according to the philosophers of antiquity, was not a purely material and mechanical machine. A great Soul, diffused everywhere, vivified all the members of the immense body of the
Universe; and an Intelligence, equally great, directed all its movements, and maintained the eternal harmony that resulted there from. Thus the Unity of the Universe, represented bv the symbolic egg,
contained in itself two units the Soul and the Intelligence, which pervaded all its parts and they were to the Universe, considered as an animated and intelligent being, what intelligence and the soul of life are
to the individuality of man.
The doctrine of the Unity of God, in this sense, was taught by Orpheus. Of this his hymn or palinode is a proof; fragments of which are quoted by many of the Fathers, as Justin, Tatian, Clemens of
Alexandria, Cyril, and Theodoret, and the whole by Eusebius, quoting from Aristobulus. The doctrine of the Locos (word) or the Noos (intellect), his incarnation, death, resurrection or transfiguration; of his
union with matter, his division in the visible world, which he pervades, his return to the original Unity, and the whole theory relative to the origin of the soul and its destiny, were taught in the Mysteries, if
which they were the, great object.
The Emperor Julian explains the Mysteries of Atys and Cybele by the same metaphysical principles, respecting the demiurgical Intelligence, its descent into matter, and its return to its origin: and extends
this explanation to those of Ceres. And so likewise does Sallust the Philosopher, who admits in God a secondary intelligent Force, which descends into the generative matter to organize it. These mystical
ideas naturally formed a part of the sacred doctrine and of the ceremonies of initiations the object of which, Sallust remarks, was to unite man with the World and the Deity, and the final term of perfection
whereof was, according to Clemens, the contemplation of nature, of real beings, and of causes. The definition of Sallust is correct. The Mysteries were practiced as a means of perfecting the souls of
making it to know its own dignity, of reminding. It of its noble origin and immortality, and consequently of its relations with the Universe and the Deity.
What was meant by real beings, was invisible beings, genii, the faculties or powers of nature;
everything not a part of the visible world, which was called, by way of opposition, apparent existence. The theory of Genii, or Powers of Nature, and its Forces, personified, made part of the Sacred Science
of initiation, and of that religious spectacle of different beings exhibited in the Sanctuary. It resulted from that belief in the providence and superintendence of the Gods, which was one of the primary
bases of initiation.

The administration of the Universe by Subaltern Genii, to whom it is confided, and by whom good and evil are dispensed in the world, was a consequence of this dogma, taught in the Mysteries of Mithias,
where was shown that famous egg, shared between Ormuzd and Ahriman, each, of whom commissioned twentyfour Genii to dispense the good and evil found therein; they being under twelve
Superior Gods, six on the side of Light and Good, and six on that of Darkness and Evil.
This doctrine of the Genii, depositaries of the Universal Providence, was intimately connected with the Ancient Mysteries, and adopted in the sacrifices and initiations 'both of Greeks and Barbarians.
Plutarch says that the Gods, by means of Genii, who are intermediates between them and men, draw near to mortals in the ceremonies of initiation, at which the Gods charge them to assist, and to
distribute punishment and blessing. Thus not the Deity, but His ministers, or a Principle and Power of Evil, were deemed the authors of vice and sin and suffering: and thus the Genii or angels differed in
character like men, some being good and some evil; some Celestial Gods, Archangels, Angels, and some Infernal Gods, Demons and fallen Angels.
At the head of the latter was their Chief, Typhon, Ahriman, or Shaitan, the Evil Principle ; who, having
wrought disorder in nature, brought troubles on men by land and sea, and caused the greatest ills, is at last punished for his crimes. It was these events and incidents, says Plutarch, which Isis desired to
represent in the ceremonial ,of the Mysteries, established by her in memory of her sorrows and wanderings, whereof she exhibited an image and representation in her Sanctuaries, where also were
afforded encouragements to piety and consolation in misfortune. The dogma of a Providence, he says, administering the Universe by means of intermediary Powers, who maintain the connection of man
with the Divinity, was eonsecrated in the hlysteries of the Egyptians, Phrygians, and Thracians, of the Magi and the Disciples of Zoroaster; as isplain by their initiations, in which mournful and funereal
ceremonies mingled.
It was an essential part of the lessons given the Initiates, to teach them the relations of their own souls with Universal Nature, the greatest lessons of all, meant to dignify man in his own eyes, and teach him
his place in the Universe of things.
Thus the whole system of the Universe was displayed in all its parts to the eyes of the Initiate; and the symbolic cave which reps resented it was adorned and clothed with all the attributes of that Universe.
To this world so organized, endowed with a double force, active and passive, divided between light and darkness, moved by a living and intelligent Force, governed by Genii or Angels who preside over its
different parts, and whose nature and character are more lofty or low is proportional as they possess a greater or less portion of dark matter, to this world descends the soul, emanation of the ethereal fire,
and exiled from the luminous region above the world. It enters into this dark matter, wherein the hostile principles, each seconded by his troops of Genii, are ever in convict, there to submit to one or more
organizations in the body which is its prison, until it shall at last return to its place of origin, its true

native country, from which daring this life it is an exile.
But one thing remained, to represent its return, through the constellations and planetary spheres, to its original home. The celestial fire, the philosophers said, soul of the world and of fire, an universal
principle, circulating above the Heavens, in a region infinitely pure and wholly luminous, itself pure, simple, and unmixed, is above the world by its specific lightness.
If any part of it (say a human soul) descends, it acts against its nature in doing so, urged by an
inconsiderate desire of the intelligence, a perfidious love for matter which causes it to descend, to know what passes here below, where good and evil are in conflict. The Soul, a simple substance, when
unconnected with matter, a ray or partscle of the Divine Fire, whose home is in Heaven, ever turns toward that home, while united with the body, and struggles to return thither.
Teaching this, the Mysteries strove to recall man to his divine origin, and point out to him the means of
returning thither. The grist science acquired in the Mysteries was knowledge of man's self, of the nobleness of his origin, the grandeur of his destiny, and his superiority over the animals, which can
never acquire this knowledge, and whom he resembles so long as he does not reject upon his existence and sound the depths of his own nature.
By doing and suffering, by virtue and piety and good deeds, the soul was enabled at length to free itself
from the body, and ascend along the path of the Milky Way, by the gate of Capricorn and by the seven spheres. to the place whence by many graduations and successive lapses and enthrallments it had
descended. And thus the theory of the spheres, and of the signs and intelligences which preside there, and the whole system of astronomy, were connected with that of the soul and its destiny; and so were
taught in the Mysteries, in which were developed the great principles of physics and metaphysics as to the origin of the soul, its condition here below, its destination, and its future fate.
The Greeks fix the date of the establishment of the Mysteries of Eleusis at the year 1423 B. C., during
the reign of Erechtheus at Athens. According to some authors, they were instituted by Ceres herself; and according to others, by that Monarch, who brought them from Egypt, where, according to Diodorus
of Sicily, he was born. Another tradition was, that Orpheus introduced them into Greece, together with the Dionysian ceremonies, copying the latter from the Mysteries of Osiris, and the former from those of
Isis.
Nor was it at Athens only, that the worship and Mysteries of Isis, metamorphosed into Ceres, were established. The Boeotians worshipped the Great or Cabiric Ceres, in the recesses of a sacred grove,
into which none but Initiates could enter; and the ceremonies there observed, and the sacred traditions of their Mysteries, were connected with those of the Cabiri in Samothrace.

So in Argos, Phocis, Arcadia, Achaia, Messenia, Corinth, and many other parts of Greece, the
Mysteries were practiced, revealing everywhere their Egyptian origin and everywhere having the same general features; but those of Eleusis, in Attica, Pausanias informs us, had been regarded by the Greeks,
from the earliest times, as being as far superior to all the others, as the Gods are to mere Heroes.
Similar to these were the Mysteries of Bona Dea, the Good Goddess, whose name, say Cicero and Plutarch, it was not permitted to any man to know, celebrated at Rome frorm the earliest times of that
city. It was these Mysteries, practiced by women alone, the secrecy of which was impiously violated by Claudius. They were held at the Kalends of May; and, according to Plutarch, much of the ceremonial
greatly resembled that of the Mysteries of Bacchus.
The Mysteries of Venus and Adonis belonged principally to Syria and Phoenicia, whence they passed into Greece and Sicily. Venus or Astarte was the Great Female Deity of the Phoenicians, as Hercules,
Melkarth or Adoni was their Chief God. Adoni, called by the Greeks Adonis, was the lover of Venus. Slain by a wound in the thigh inflicted by a wild boar in the chase, the flower called anemone sprang
from his blood. Venus received the corpse and obtained from Jupiter the boon that her lover should thereafter pass six months of each year with her, and the other six in the Shades with Proserpine; an
allegorical description of the alternate residence of the Sun in the two hemispheres. In these Mysteries his death was represented and mounted, and after this maceration and mourning were concluded, his
resurrection and ascent to Heaven were announced.
Ezekiel speaks of the festivals of Adonis under the name of those of Thammuz, an Assyrian Deity, whom every year the women mourned, seated at the doors of their dwellings. These Mysteries, like the
others, were celebrated in the Spring, at the Vernal Equinox, when he was restored to life; at which time, when they were instituted, the Sun (Adoni, Lord, or Master) was in the Sign Taurus, the domicile
of Venus. He was represented with horns, and the hymn of Orpheus in his honor styles him "the two horned God" as in Argos Bacchus was represented with the feet of a bull.
Plutarch says that Adonis and Bacchus were regarded as one and the same Deity; and that this opinion
was founded on the great similarity in very many respects between the Mysteries of these two Gods.
The Mysteries of Bacchus were known as the Sabazian, Orphic and Dionysian Festivals. They went back to the remotest antiquity among the Greeks, and were attributed by some to Bacchus himself, and
by others to Orpheus. The resemblance in ceremonial between the observances established in honor of Osiris in Egypt, and those in honor of Bacchus in Greece, the mythological traditions of the two Gods,
and the symbols used in the festivals of each, amply prove their identity. Neither the name of Bacchus, nor the word orgies applied to his feasts, nor the sacred words used in his Mysteries, are Greek, but of

foreign origin. Bacchus was an Oriental Deity, worshipped in the East, and his orgies celebrated there, long before the Greeks adopted them. In the earliest times he was worshipped in India, Arabia, and
Bavaria. He was honored in Greece with public festivals, and in simple or complicated Mysteries, varying in ceremonial in various places, as was natural, because his worship had come thither from
different countries and at different periods, The people who celebrated the complicated Mysteries were ignorant of the meaning of many words which they used and of many embalms which they revered. In
the Sabazian Feasts, for example [from SabaZeus, an oriental name of this Deity], the words EVOI, SABOI, Were used, which are in nowise Greek; and a serpent of gold was thrown into the bosom of the
Initiate, in allusion to the fable that Jupiter had, in the form of a serpent, had connection with Proserpine, and begotten Bakchos, the bull whence the enigmatical saying, repeated to the Initiates, that
a bull engendered a dragon or serpent, and the serpent in turn engendered the bull, who became Bakchos : the meaning if which was, that the bull [Taurus, which then opened the Vernal Equinox, and
the Sun in which Sign, figuratively represented by the Sign itself, was Bakchos, Dionysus, SabaZeus, Osiris, etc], and the Serpent, another constellation, occupied such relative positions in the Heavens, that
when one rose the other set, and vice versa.
The serpent was a familiar symbol in the Mysteries of Bakchos. The Initiates grasped them with their hands, as Orphiucus does on the celestial globe, and the Orpheotelestes, or purifier of candidates did
the same, crying, as Demosthenes taunted. AEschines with doing in public at the head of the women whom his mother was to imitate, EVOI, SAB0I, HYES ATTE, ANTE, HYES!
The Initiates in these Mysteries had preserved the ritual and ceremonies that accorded with the
simplicity of the earliest ages, and the manners of the first men. The rules of Pythagoras were followed there. Like the Egyptians, who held wool unclean, they buried no Initiate in woolen garments. They
abstained from bloody sacrifices; and lived on fruits or vegetables or inanimate things. They imitated the life of the contemplative Sects of the Orient; thus approximating to the tranquility of the first men,
who lived exempt from trouble and crimes in the bosom of a profound peace. One of the most precious advantages promised by their initiation was, to put a man in communion with the Gods, by purifying
his soul of all the passions that interfere with that enjoyment, and dim the rays of divine light that are communicated to every soul capable of receiving them, and that imitate their purity. One of the degrees
of initiation was the state of inspiration to which the adapts were claimed to attain. The Initiates in the Mysteries of the Lamb, at Pepuza, in Phrygia, professed to be inspired, and prophesied and it was
claimed that the soul, by means of these religious ceremonies, purified of any stain, could see the Gods in this life, and certainly, in all cases, after death. The sacred gates of the Temple, where the ceremonies
of initiation were performed, were opened but once in each year, and no stranger was ever allowed to enter. It threw her veil over these august Mysteries, which could be revealed to no, one. There the
sufferings of Bakchos were represented, who, like Osiris, died, descended to hell and rose to life again; and raw flesh was distributed to the Initiates, which each ate, in memory of the death df the Deity, torn
in pieces by the Titans.

These Mysteries also were celebrated at the Vernal Equinox; and the emblem of generation, to express the active energy and generative power of the Divinity, was a principal symbol. The Initiates wore
garlands and crowns of myrtle and laurel.
In these Mysteries, the aspirant was kept in terror and darkness to perform the three days and nights; and was then made Afaismos. Of Ceremony representing the death of Bakchos, the same mythological
personage with Osiris.
This was effected by coffining him in a close cell, that he might seriously reflect, in solitude and darkness, on the business he was engaged in and his mind be prepared for the reception of the sublime
and mysterious truths of primitive revelation and philosophy. This was a symbolic death; the deliverance from it, regeneration; after which he was called difns or twinborn. While confined in the
cell, the pursuit of Typhon after the mangled body of Osiris, and the search of Rhea or Isis for the same, were enacted in his hearing; the initiated crying aloud the names, of that Deity derived from the
Sanskrit. Then it was announced that the body was found and the aspirant was liberated amid shoots of joy and exultation.
Then he passed through a representation of Hell and Elysium. "Then," said an ancient writer, "they are
entertained with hymns and dances, with the sublime doctrines of sacred knowledge, and with wonderful and holy visions. And now become perfect and initiated, they are FREE, and no longer under
restraint; but, crowned, and triumphant, they walk up and down the regions of the blessed, converse with pure and holy men, and celebrate the sacred Mysteries at pleasure." They were taught the nature
and objects of the Mysteries, and the means of making themselves known, and received the name of Epopts; were fully instructed ie the nature and attributes of the Divinity, and the doctrine of a future
state; and made acquainted with the unity and attributes of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and the true meaning of the fables in regard to the Gods of Paganism: the great Truth being often proclaimed,
that "Zeus is the primitive Source of all things; there is one God; one power, and one rule over all." And after full explanation of the many symbols and emblems that surrounded them, they were dismissed
with the barbarous words Kog? Ompa? corruptions of the Sanskrit words, Kanska Aom Pakscha; meaning, object of our wishes, God, Silence, or Worship the Deity in Silence.
Among the emblems used was the rod of Bakchos; which once, it was said, he cast on the ground, and
it became a serpent; and at another time he struck the rivers Orontes and Hydaspes with it, and the waters receded and he passed over dryshod. Water was obtained, during the ceremonies, by striking a
rock with it. The Bakchae crowned their heads with serpents, carried them in vases and baskets, and at the Evehois, or finding, of the body of Osiris, cast one, alive, into the aspirant's bosom.
The Mysteries of Atys in Phrygia, and those of Cybele his mistress, like their worship, much resembled

those of Adonis and Bakchos, Osiris and Isis. Their Asiatic origin is universally admitted, and was with great plausibility claimed by Phrygia, which contested the palm of antiquity with Egypt. They, more
than any other people, mingled allegory with their religious worship, and were great inventors of fables; and their sacred traditions as to Cybele and Atys, whom all admit to be Phrygian Gods, were very
various. In all, as we learn from Julius Firmicus, they represented by allegory the phenomena, of nature and the succession of physical facts, under the veil of a marvelous history.
Their feasts occurred at the equinoxes, commencing with lamentation, mourning, groans, and pitiful
cries for the heath of Atys and ending with rejoicings at his restoration to life. We shall not recite the different versions of the legend of Atys and Cybele, given by Julius Firmicus, Diodorus, Arnobius,
Lactantius, Servius, Saint Augustine, and Pausanas. It is enough to say that it is in substance this that Cybele, a Phrygian Princess, who invented musical instruments and dances, was enamored of Atys, a
youth; that either he in a fit of frenzy mutilated himself or was mutilated by her in a paroxysm of jealousy; that he died, and afterward, like Adonis, was restored to life.' It is the Phoenician fiction as to
the SunGod, expressed in other terms, under other 'forms, and with other names.' Cybele was worshipped in Syria, under the name of Rhea.
Lucian says that the Lydian Atys there established her worship and built her temple. The name of Rhea
is also found in the ancient cosmogony of the Phoenicians by Sanchoniathon. It was' Atys the Lydian, says Lucian, who, having been mutilated, first established the Mysteries of Rhea, and taught the
Phrygians, the Lydians, and the people of Samothrace to celebrate them. Rhea, like Cybele, was represented drawn by lions, bearing a drum, and crowned with flowers.
According to Varro, Cybele represented the earth. She partook of the characteristics of Minerva, Venus,
the Moon, Diana, Nemesis, and the Furies; was clad in precious stones and her High Priest wore a robe of purple and a tiara of gold.
The Grand Feast of the Syrian Goddess, like that of the Mother of the Gods at Rome, was celebrated at
the Vernal Equinox. Precisely at that equinox the Mysteries of Atys were celebrated,' in which thi Initiates were taught to expect the rewards of a future life, and the flight of Atys from the jealous fury
of Cybele was described, his concealment in the mountains and in a cave, and His selfmutilation in a fit of delirium; in which act his priests imitated him. The feast of the passion of Atys continued three
days; the first of which was passed in mourning and tears; to which afterward clamorous rejoicings succeeded; by which, Macrobius says, the Sun was adored under the name of Atys. The ceremonies
were all allegorical, some of which, according to the Emperor Julian, could be explained, but more remained covered with the veil of mystery. Thus it is that symbols outlast their explanations, as many
have done in Masonry, and ignorance and rashness substitute new ones.

In another legend, given by Pausanias, Atys dies, wounded like Adonis by a wild boar in the organs of generation; a mutilation with which all the legends ended. The pine tree under which he was said to
have died, was sacred to him; and was found upon many monuments, with a bull and a ram near it; one the sign of exaltation of the Sun, and the other of that of the Moon.
The worship of the Sun under the name of Mithras belonged to Persia, whence that name came, as did
the erudite symbols of that worship. The Persians, adorers of Fire, regarded the Sun as; the most brilliant abode of the fecundating energy of that element, which gives life to the earth, and circulates in
every part of the Universe, of which it is, as it were, the soul.
This worship passed from Persia into Armenia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia, long before it was known at Rome. The Mysteries of Mithras flurished more than any others in the imperial city. The worship of
Mithras commenced to prevail there under Trojan. Hadrian prohibited these Mysteries, on account of the cruel scenes represented in their ceremonial for human victims were immolated therein, and the
events of futurity looked for in their palpitatirig entrails.
They reappeared in greater splendor than ever under Commodus, who with his own hand sacrificed a victim to Mithras and they were still more practiced under Constantine and his successors, when the
Priests of Mithras were found everywhere in the Roman Empire, and the monuments of his worship appeared even in Britain.
Caves were consecrated to Mithras, in which were collected a multitude of astronomical emblems and
cruel tests were required of the Initiates. The Persians built no temples; but worshipped upon the summits of hills, in enclosures of unhewn stones. They abominated images, and made the Sun and Fire
emblems of the Deity. The Jews borrowed this from them, and represented God as appearing to Abraham in a flame of fire, and to Moses as a fire at Horeb and on Sinai.
With the Persians, Mithras, typified in the Sun, was the invisible Deity, the Parent of the Universe, the
Mediator. In Zoroaster's cave of initiation, the Sun and Planets were represented overhead, in gems and gold, as also was the Zodiac. The Sun appeared emerging from the back of Taurus. Three great pillars,
Eternity, Fecundity, and Authority, supported the roof and the whole was at emblem of the Universe.
Zoroaster, like Moses, claimed to have conversed face to face, as man with man, with the Deity; and to have received from Him a system of pure worship, to be communicated only to the virtue ous, and those
who would devote themselves to the study of Philosophy. His fame spread over the world, and pupils came to him from every country. Even Pythagoras was his scholar.

After his novitiate, the candidate entered the cavern of initiation, and was received on the point of a sword presented to his naked left breast, by which he was slightly wounded. Being crowned with olive,
anointed with balsam of benzoin, and other wise prepared, he was purified with fire and. Water, and went through seven stages of initiation, The symbol of these stages was a high ladder with seven rounds
or steps. In them, he went through many fearful trial's in which darkness displayed a principal part. He saw a representation of the wicked in Hides; and finally emerged from darkness into light. Received it a
place representing Elysium, in the brilliant assembly of the initiated, where the Arch magus presided, robed in blue, he assumed the obligations of secrecy, and was entrusted with the Sacred Words, of
which the Ineffable Name of God was the chief.
Then all the incidents of his initiation were explained to him he was taught that these ceremonies brought him nearer the Deity and that he should adore the consecrated Fire, the gift of that Deity and
His visible residence. He was taught the sacred characters known only to the initiated; and instructed in regard to the creation of the world, and the true philosophical meaning of the vulgar mythology; and
especially of the legend of Ormuzd and Ahriman, and the symbolic meaning of the six Amshaspands created by the former Bahman, the Lord of Light; Ardibehest, the Genius of Fire; Shariver, the Lord of
Splendor and Metals; Stapandomad, the Source of Fruitfulness; Kkordad, the Genius of Water and Time and Amerdad, the protector of the Vegetable World, and the prime cause of growth. And finally
he was taught the true nature of the Supreme Being, Creator of Ormuzd and Ahriman, the' Absolute First Cause, styled Zeruane Akherene.
In the Mithriac initiation were several Degrees. The first, Tertullian says, was that of Soldier of Mithras.
The ceremony oi reception consisted in presenting the candidate a crown, supported by a sword. It was placed near his head, and he repelled it, saying, "Mithras is my, crown." Then he was declared the
soldier of Mithras, and had the right to call the other Initiates fellow soldiers or companions in arms. Hence the title Companions in the Royal Arch Degree of the American Rite. Then he passed, Porphyry
says, through the Degree of the Lion, the constellation Leo, domicile of the Sun and symbol of Mithras, found on his monuments. These ceremonies were termed at Rome Leontic and Helium and Coracia or
HieroCoracia, of Heavens below the Lion, with the Hydra, and also appearing on the Mithras monuments.
Thence he passed to a higher Degree, where the Initiates were 'called Perses and children of the Sun.
Above them were the Fathers, whose chief or Patriarch was styled Father of Fathers, or Pater Patratus. The Initiates also bore the title of Eagles and Hawks, birds consecrated to the Sun in Egypt, the former
sacred to the God Mendes, and the latter the emblem of the Sun and Royalty.
The little island of Samothrace was long the depositary of certain august Mysteries, and many went thither from all parts of Greece to be initiated. It was said to have been settled by the ancient Pelasgi,
early Asiatic colonists in Greece. The Gods adored in the Mysteries of this island were termed CABIRI,

325/641
an oriental word, from Caber, great Varro calls the Gods of Samothrace, Potent Gods. In Arabic, Venus is called Caber Varro says that the Great Deities whose Mysteries were practiced there, were Heaven
and Earth. These were but symbols of the Active and Passive Powers or Principles of universal generation.
The two Twins, Castor and Pollux, or the Dioscuri, were also called the Gods of Samothrace; and the
Scholiast of Apollonius, citing Mnaseas, gives the names of Ceres, Proserpine, Pluto, and Mercury, as the four Cabiric Divinities worshipped at Samothrace, as Axieros, Axiocersa, Axiocersus, and
Casmillus.
Mercury was, there as everywhere, the minister and messenger of the Gods and the young servitors of the altars and the children employed in the Temples were called Mercuries or Casmillus, as they were in
Tuscany, by the Etrusci and Pelasgi, who worshipped the Great Gods.
Tarquin the Etruscan was an Initiate of the mysteries of Samothrace; and Etruria had its Cabiri as Samothrace had. For the worship of the Cabiri spread from that island into Etruria, Phrygia, and Asia
Minor and it probably came from Phoenicia into Samothrace for the Cabiri are mentioned by Sanchoniathon; and the word Caber belongs to the Hebrew, Phoenician, and Arabic languages.
The Dioscuri, tutelary Deities of Navigation, with Venus, were invoked in the Mysteries of Samothrace.
The constellation Auriga, or Phaeton, was also honored there with imposing ceremonies. Upon the Aeronautic expedition, Orpheus, an Initiate of these Mysteries, a storm arising, counseled his
companions to put into Samothrace. They did so, the storm ceased, and they were initiated into the Mysteries there, and sailed again with the assurance of a fortunate voyage, under the auspices of the
Dioscuri, patrons of sailors and navigation.
But much more than that was promised the Initiates. The Hierophants of Samothrace made something infinitely greater to be the object of their initiations to wit, the consecration of men to the Deity, by
pledging them to virtue and the assurance of those rewards which the justice of the Gods reserves for Initiates after death. This, above all else, made these ceremonies august, and inspired everywhere so
great a respect for them, and so great a desire to be admitted to them that originally caused the island to be styled Sacred. It was respected by all nations. The Romans, when masters of the world, left it its
liberty and laws. It was an asylum for the unfortunates and a sanctuary inviolable.
There men were absolved of the crime of homicide, if not committed in a temple. Children of tender age were initiated there, and invested with the sacred robe, the purple tincture, and the crown of olive,
and seated upon a throne, like other Initiates. In the ceremonies was represented the death if the youngest of the Cabiri, slain by his brothers, who fled into Etruria, carrying with them the chest or ark

326/641
that contained, his genitals and there the Phallus and the sacred ark were adored. Herodotus says that the Samothracian Initiates understood the object and origin of this reverence paid the Phallus, and why
it was exhibited in the Mysteries. Clement of Alexandria says that the Cabiri taught the Tuscany to revere it. It was consecrated at Heliopolis in Syria, where the mysteries of a Divinity having many
points of resemblance with. Atys and Cybele were represented. The Pelasgi connected it with Mercury; and it appears on the monuments of Mathias; always and everywhere a symbol of the lifegiving power
of the Sun at the Vernal Equinox. In the Indian Mysteries, as the candidate made his three circuits, he paused each time he reached the South, and said, "I copy the example of the Sun, and follow his
beneficent course." Blue Masonry has renamed the Circuits, but has utterly lost the explanation; which is, that in the Mysteries the candidate invariably represented the Sun, descending Southward toward the
reign of. The Evil Principle, Ahriman, Sita, or Typhon (darkness and winter); there figuratively to be slain, and after a few days to rise again from the dead, and commence to ascend to the Northward. Then
the death of Sita was bewailed; or that of Cama, slain by Iswara, aid committed to the waves on a chest, like Osiris and Bacchus; during which the candidate was terrified by phantoms and horrid noises.
Then he was made to personify Vishnu, and perform his avatars, or labors. In the first two he was
taught in allegories the legend of the Deluge in the first he took three steps at right angles, representing the three huge steps taken by Vishnu in that avatar; and hence the three steps in the Master's Degree
ending at right angles.
The nine avatars finished, he was taught the necessity of faith, as superior to sacrifices, acts of charity, or mortifications of the flesh. Then he was admonished against five crimes, and took a solemn
obligation never to commit them. He was then introduced into a representation of Paradise; the Company of the Members of the Order, magnificently arrayed, and the Altar with a fire blazing upon it,
as an emblem of the Deity.
Then a new name was given him, and he was invested in a white robe and tiara, and received the signs, tokens, and lectures. A cross was marked on his forehead, and an inverted level, or the Tau Cross, on his
breast. He received the sacred cord, and divers amulets or talismans; and was then invested with the sacred Word or Sublime Name, known only to the initiated, the Trilateral A. U. M.
Then the multitude of emblems was explained to the candidate; the arcana of science hidden under
them, and the different virtues of which the mythological figures were more personifications. And he thus learned the meaning of those symbols, which, to the uninitiated, were but a maze of unintelligible
figures. Godhead, the happiness of the patriarchs, the destruction by the Deluge, the depravity of the heart, and the necessity of a mediator, the instability of life, the final destruction of all created things,
and the restoration of the world in a more perfect form. They inculcated the Eternity of the Soul, explained the meaning of the doctrine of the Metempsychosis, and held thedoctrine of a state of future
rewards and punishments: and they also earnestly urged that sins could only be atoned for by

repentance, reformation, and voluntary penance; and not by mere ceremonies and sacrifices.
The Mysteries among the Chinese and Japanese came from India, and were founded on the same principles and with similar rites. The word given to the new Initiate was OMiTo Fo, in which we
recognize the original name A. U. M., coupled at a much later time with that of Fo, the Indian Buddha, to show that he was the Great Deity Himself.
The equilateral triangle was one of their symbols; and so was the mystical Y; both alluding to the
Triune God, and the latter being the ineffable name of the Deity. A ring supported by two serpents was emblematical of the world, protected by the power and wisdom of the Creator; and that is the origin of
the two parallel lines (into which time has changed the two serpents), that support the circle in our Lodges.
Among the Japanese, the term of probation for the highest Degree was twenty years.
The main features of the Druidical Mysteries resembled those of the Orient. The ceremonies
commenced with a hymn to the sun. The candidates were arranged in ranks of threes, fives, and sevens, according to their qualifications; and conducted nine times around the Sanctuary, from East to West.
The candidate underwent many trials, one of which had direct reference to the legend of Osiris. He was placed in a boat, and sent out to sea alone, having to rely on his own skill and presence of mind to reach
the opposite shore in safety. The death of Hu was represented in his hearing, with every external mark of sorrow, while he was in utter darkness. He met with many obstacles, had to prove his courage, and
expose his life against armed enemies; represented various animals, and at last, attaining the permanent light, he was instructed by the ArchDruid in regard to the Mysteries, and in the morality of the third
Degree was a life of seclusion, after the Initiate's children were capable of providing for themselves; passed in the forest, in the practice of prayers and ablutions, and living only on vegetables. He was then
said to be born again.
The fourth was absolute renunciation of the world, selfcontemplation add selftorture; by which Perfection was thought to be attained, and the soul merged in the Deity. In the second Degree, the
Initiate was taught the Unity of the Order, incited to act bravely in war, taught the great truths of the immortality of the soul and a future state, solemnly enjoined not to neglect the worship of the Deity,
nor the practice of rigid morality; and to avoid sloth, contention, and folly.
The aspirant attained only the exoteric knowledge in the first two Degrees. The third was attained only by a few, and they persons of rank and consequence, and after long purification, and study of all the arts
and sciences known to the Druids, in solitude, for nine months. This was the symbolical death and burial of these Mysteries.

The dangerous voyage upon the actual open sea, in a small boat covered with a skin, on the evening of
the 29th of April, was the last trial, and closing scene, of initiation. If he declined this trial, he was dismissed with contempt. If he made it and succeeded, he was termed thriceborn, was eligible to all
the dignities of the State, and received complete instruction in the philosophical and religious doctrines of the Druids.
The Greeks also styled the, Epopihz Tigo, thriceborn and in India perfection was assigned to the Yogi
who had accomplished many births. The general features of the initiations among the Goths were the same as in all the Mysteries. A long probation, of fasting and mortification, circular processions,
representing the march of the celestial bodies, many fearful tests and trials, a descent into the infernal regions, the killing of the God Balder by the Evil Principle, Lok, the placing of his body in a boat and
sending it abroad upon the waters and in short, the Eastern Legend, under different names, and with some variations.
The Egyptian Anubis appeared there, as the dog guarding the gates of death. The candidate was
immured in the representation of a tomb and when released, goes in search of the body of Balder, and finds him, at length restored to life, and seated upon a throne. He was obligated upon a naked sword (as
is still the custom in the Rit Moderne) and sealed his obligation by drinking mead out of a human skull.
Then all the ancient primitive truths were made known to him, so far as they had survived the assaults of time and he was informed as to the generation of the Gods, the creation of the world, the deluge, and
the resurrection, of which that of Balder was a type. He was marked with the sign of the cross and a ring was given to him as a symbol of the Divine Protection and also as an emblem of Perfection from
which comes the custom of giving a ring to the Aspirant in the 14th Degree.
The point within Circle and the Cube, emblem of Odin, were explained to him; and lastly, the nature of the Supreme God, "the author of everything that existeth, the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and
Awful Being, the Searcher into concealed things', the Being that never changeth" with whom Odin the Conqueror was by the vulgar confounded and the Triune God of the Indians was reproduced, as Odin,
the Almighty FATHER, FREA, (Rhea or Phre), his wife (emblem of universal matter), and Thor his son (the Mediator). Here we recognize Osiris, Isis, and Hor or Horus. Around the head of Thor, as if to
show his eastern origin, twelve stars were arranged in a circle.
He was also taught the ultimate destruction of the world, and the rising of a new one, in which the brave and virtuous shall enjoy everlasting happiness and delight as the means of securing which happy
fortune, he was taught to practise the strictest morality and virtue. The Initiate was prepared to receive the great lessons of all the Mysteries, by long trials, or by abstinence and chastity. For many days he

329/641
was required to fast and be continent, and to drink liquids calculated to diminish his passions and keep him chaste. Ablutions were also required, symbolical of the purity necessary to enable the soul to
escape from its bondage in matter. Sacred butts and preparatory baptisms were used, lustrations, immersions, lustral sprinklings, and purifications of every kind. At Athens they bathed in the Ilissus,
which thence became a sacred river; and before enteringthe Temple of Eleusis, all were required to wash their hands in a vase of lustral water placed near the entrance. Clean hands and a pure heart were
required of the candidates.
Apuleius bathed seven times in the sea, symbolical of the Seven Spheres through which the Soul must reascend ; add the Hindus must bathe in the sacred river Ganges.
Clement of Alexandria cites a passage of Meander, who speaks of a purification by sprinkling three
times with salt and water Sulphur, resin, and the laurel also served for purification as did air, earth, water, and fire. The Initiates at Heliopolis, in Syria, says Lucian, sacrificed the sacred lamb, symbol of
Aries, then the sign of the Vernal Equinox; ate his flesh, as the Israelites did at the Passover and then touched his head and feet to theirs, and knelt upon the fleece. Then they bathed in warm water, drank of
the same, and slept upon the ground.
There was a distinction between the lesser and greater Mysteries. One must have been for some years admitted to the former, before he could receive the latter, which were but a preparation for them, the
Vestibule of the temple, of which those of Eleusis were the Sanctuary. There, in the lesser Mysteries, they were prepared to receive the holy truths taught in the greater. The Initiates in the lesser were called
simply Mystic, or Initiates; but those in the greater, Epopts) or Seers. An ancient poet says that the former were an imperfect shadow of the latter, as sleep is of Death. After admission to the former, the
Initiate was taught lessons of morality, and the rudiments of the sacred science, the most sublime and secret part of which was reserved for the Epopt, who saw the Truth in its nakedness, while the Mystic
only viewed it through a veil and under emblems fitter to excite than to satisfy his curiosity.
Before communicating the first secrets and primary dogmas of initiation, the priests required the candidate to take a fearful oath never to divulge the secrets. Then he made his vows, prayers, and
sacrifices to the Gods. The skins of the victims consecrated to Jupiter were spread on the ground, and he was made to set his feet upon them. He was then taught some enigmatic formulas, as answers to
questions, by which to make himself known. He was then enthroned, invested with a purple tincture, and crowned with flowers, or branches of palm or olive.
We do not certainly know the time that was required to elapse between the admission to the Lesser and
Greater Mysteries of Eleusis. Most writers fix it at five years. It was a singular mark of favor when Demetrius was made Mystic and Epopt in one and the same ceremony. When at length admitted to the

Degree of perfection, the Initiate was brought face to face with entire nature, and learned that the soul was the whole of man; that earth was but his place of exile; that Heaven was his native country; that for
the soul to be born is really to die; and that death was for it the return to a new life. Then he entered the sanctuary; but he did not receive the whole instruction at once. It continued through several years.
There were, as it were, many apartments, through which be advanced by degrees, and between which thick veils intervened.
There were Statues and Paintings, says Proclus, in the inmost sanctuary, showing the forms assumed by
the Gods. Finally the last veil fell, the sacred covering dropped from the image of the Goddess, and she stood revealed in all her splendor, surrounded by a divine light, which, filling the whole sanctuary,
dazzled the eyes and penetrated the soul of the Initiate. Thus is
symbolized the final revelation of the true doctrine as to the nature of Deity and of the soul, and of the
relations of each to matter. This was preceded by frightful scenes, alternations of fear and joy, of light and darkness; by glittering lightning and the crashed thunder, and apparitions of specters, or magical
illusions, impressing at once the eyes and ears. This Claudian describes, in his poem on the rape of Proserpine, where he alludes to what passed in her Mysteries. "The temple is shaken," he cries; fiercely
gleams the lightning, by which the Deity announces his presence. "Earth trembles; and a terrible noise is heard in the midst of these terrors. The Temple of the Son of Cecrops resounds with longcontinued
roars; Eleusis uplifts her sacred torches; the serpents of Triptolemus are heard to hiss; and fearful Hecate appears afar."
The celebration of the Greek Mysteries continued, according to the better opinion, for nine days. On the
first the Initiates met. It was the day of the full moon, of the month Boedromion ; when the moon was full at the end of the sign Aries, near the Pleiades and the place of her exaltation in Taurus. The second
day there was a procession to the sea, for purification by bathing. The third was occupied with offerings, expiatory sacrifices, and other religious rites, such as fasting, mourning, continence, etc. A
mullet was immolated, and offerings of grain and living animals made. On the fourth they carried in procession the mystic wreath of flowers, representing that which Proserpine dropped when seized by
Pluto, and the Crown of Ariadne in the Heavens. It was borne on a triumphal car drawn by oxen; and women followed bearing mystic chests or boxes, wrapped with purple clothe, captaining grains of
sesame, pyramidal biscuits, salt, pomegranates and the mysterious serpent, and perhaps the mystic phallus. On the fifth was the superb procession of torches, commemorative of the search for Proserpine
by Ceres; the Initiates marching by trios, and each bearing a torch; while at the head of the
procession marched the Dadoukos.
The sixth was consecrated to Iakchos, the young LightGod, son of Ceres, reared in the sanctuaries and
bearing the torch of the SunGod. The chorus in Aristophanes terms him the luminous star that lights the nocturnal initiation. He was brought from the sanctuary, his head crowned with myrtle, and borne
from the gate of the Ceramicus to Eleusis, along the sacred way, amid dances, sacred songs, every mark

of joy, and mystic cries of Iakchos.
On the seventh there were gymnastic exercises and combats, the victors in which were crowned and rewarded. On the eighth was the feast of AEsculapius. On the ninth the famous libation was made for
the souls of the departed. The Priests, according to Athenaus, filled two vases, placed one in the East and one in the West, toward the gates of day and night, and overturned them,
pronouncing a formula of mysterious prayers. Thus they invoked Light and Darkness, the two great' principles of nature.
During all these days no one could be arrested, nor any suit brought, on pain of death, or at least a
heavy fine and no one was allowed, by the display of unusual wealth or magnificence, to endeavor to rival this sacred pomp. Everything was for religion. Such were the Mysteries; and such the Old
Thought, as in scattered and widely separated fragments it has come down to us.
The human mind still speculates upon the great mysteries of nature, and still finds its ideas anticipated by the ancients, whose profoundest thoughts are to be looked for, not in `their philosophies, but in their
symbols, by which they endeavored to express the great ideas that vainly struggled for utterance in words, as they viewed fhe great circle of phenomena, Birth, Life, Death, or Decomposition, and New
Life out of Death and Rottenness, to them the greatest of mysteries. Remember, while you study their symbols, that they had a profounder sense of these wonders than we have. To them the transformations
of the worm were a greater wonder than the stars; and hence the poor dumb scarabaeus or beetle was sacred to them. Thus their faiths are condensed into symbols or expanded into allegories, which they
understood, but were not always able to explain in language; for there are thoughts and ideas which no language ever spoken by man has words to express.
XXV. NIGHT OF THE BRAZEN SERPENT
This Degree is both philosophical and moral. While it teaches the necessity of reformation as well as repentance, as a means of obtaining mercy and forgiveness, it is also devoted to an explanation of the
symbols of Masonry; and especially to those which are connected with that ancient and universal legend, of which that of KhirOm Abi is but a variation; that legend which, representing a murder or a
death, and a restoration to life, by a drama in which figure Osiris, Isis and Horus, Atys and Cybele, Adonis and Venus, the Cabiri, Dionusos, and many another representative of the active and passive
Powers of Nature, taught the Initiates in the Mysteries that the rule of Evil and Darkness is but temporary, and that that of Light and Good will be eternal.

Maimonides says: "In the days of Enos, the son of Seth, men fell into grievous errors, and even Enos himself partook of their infatuation.
Their language was, that since God has placed on high the heavenly bodies, and used them as His
ministers, it was evidently His will that they should receive from man the same veneration as the servants of a great prince justly claim from the subject multitude. Impressed with this notion, they
began to build temples to the Stars, to sacrifice to them, and to worship them, in the vain expectation that they should thus please the Creator of all things.
At first, indeed they did not suppose the Stars to be the only Deities, but adored in conjunction with
them the Lord God Omnipotent. In process of time, however, that great and venerable Name was totally forgotten, and the whole human race retained no other religion than the
idolatrous worship of the Host of Heaven."
The first learning in the world consisted chiefly in symbols. The wisdom of the Chald�ans,
Ph�nicians, Egyptians, Jews; of Zoroaster, Sanchoniathon, Pherecydes, Syrus, Pythagoras, Socrates,
Plato, of all the ancients, that is come to our hand, is symbolic. It was the mode, says Serranus on Plato's Symposium, of the Ancient Philosophers, to represent truth by certain symbols and hidden
images.
"All that can be said concerning the Gods," says Strabo, "must be by the exposition of old opinions and fables; it being the custom of the ancients to wrap up in enigma and allegory their thoughts and
discourses concerning Nature which are therefore not easily explained."
As you learned in the 24th Degree, my Brother, the ancient Philosophers regarded the soul of man as having had its origin in Heaven. That was, Macrobius says, a settled opinion among them all; and they
held it to be the only true wisdom, for the soul, while united with the body, to look ever toward its source, and strive to return to the place whence it came. Among the fixed stars it dwelt, until, seduced
by the desire of animating a body, it descended to be imprisoned in matter. Thenceforward it has no other resource than recollection, and is ever attracted to toward its birthplace and home. The means of
return are to be sought for in itself. To reascend to its source, it must do and suffer in the body.
Thus the Mysteries taught the great doctrine of the divine nature and longings after immortality of the soul, of the nobility of its origin, the grandeur of its destiny, its superiority over the animals who have
no aspirations heavenward. If they struggled in vain to express its nature, by comparing it to Fire and Light, if they erred as to its original place of abode, and the mode of it descent, and the path which,
descending and ascending, it pursued among the stars and spheres, these were the accessories of the

Great Truth, and mere allegories designed to make the idea more impressive, and, as it were, tangible, to the human mind.
Let us, in order to understand this old Thought, first follow the soul in its descent. The sphere or
Heaven of the fixed stars was that Holy Region, and those Elysian Fields, that were the native domicile of souls, and the place to which they reascended, when they had recovered their primitive purity and
simplicity. From that luminous region the soul set forth, when it journeyed toward the body; a destination which it did not reach until it had undergone three degradations, designated by the name of
Deaths; and until it had passed through the several spheres and the elements. All souls remained in possession of Heaven and of happiness, so long as they were wise enough to avoid the contagion of the
body, and to keep themselves from any contact with matter. But those who, from that lofty abode, where they were lapped in eternal light, have looked longingly toward the body, and toward that which
we here below call life, but which is to the soul a real death; and who have conceived for it a secret desire, those souls, victims of their concupiscence, are attracted by degrees toward the inferior regions
of the world, by the mere weight of thought and of that terrestrial desire. The soul, perfectly incorporeal, does not at once invest itself with the gross envelope of the body, but little by little, by
successive and insensible alterations, and in proportion as it removes further and further from the simple and perfect substance in which it dwelt at first. It first surrounds itself with a body composed of
the substance of the stars; and afterward, as it descends through the several spheres, with ethereal matter more and more gross, thus by degrees descending to an earthly body; and its number of
degradations or deaths being the same as that of the spheres which it traverses.
The Galaxy, Macrobius says, crosses the Zodiac in two opposite points, Cancer and Capricorn, 'the tropical points in the sun's course, ordinarily called the Gates of the Sun. These two tropics, before his
time, corresponded with those constellations, but in his day with Gemini and Sagittarius, in consequence of the precession of the equinoxes; but the signs of the Zodiac remained unchanged; and
the Milky Way crossed at the signs Cancer and Capricorn, though not at those constellations.
Through these gates souls were supposed to descend to earth and reascend to Heaven. One, Macrobius says, in his dream of Scorpio, was styled the Gate of Men; and the other, the Gate of the Gods. Cancer
was the former, because souls descended by it to the earth; and Capricorn the latter, because by it they reascended to their seats of immortality, and became Gods. From the Milky Way, according to
Pythagoras, diverged the route to the dominions of Pluto. Until they left the Galaxy, they were not deemed to have commenced to descend toward the terrestrial bodies. From that they departed, and to
that they returned. Until they reached the sign Cancer, they had not left it, and were still Gods. When they reached Leo, they commenced their apprenticeship for their future condition; and when they were
at Aquarius, the sign opposite Leo, they were furthest removed from human life.
The soul, descending from the celestial limits, where the Zodiac and Galaxy unite, loses its spherical

shape, the shape of all Divine Nature, and is lengthened into a cone, as a point is lengthened into a line; and then, an indivisible monad before, it divides itself and becomes a duad that is, unity becomes
division, disturbance, and conflict. Then it begins to experience the disorder which reigns in matter, to which it unites itself, becoming, as it were, intoxicated by draughts of grosser matter of which
inebriation the cup of Bakchos, between Cancer and Leo, is a symbol. It is for them the cup of forgetfulness. They assemble, says Plato, in the fields of oblivion, to drink there the water of the river
Ameles, which causes men to forget everything. This fiction is also found in Virgil. "If souls," says Macrobius, "carried with them into the bodies they occupy all the knowledge which they had acquired
of divine things, during their sojourn in the Heavens, men would not differ in opinion as to the Deity; but some of them forget more, and some less, of that which they had learned."
We smile at these notions of the ancients; but we must learn to look through these material images and
allegories, to the ideas, struggling for utterance, the great speechless thoughts which they envelop and it is well for us to consider whether we ourselves have yet found out any better way of representing to
ourselves the souls origin and its advent into this body, so entirely foreign to it; if indeed, we have ever thought about it at all; or have not ceased to think, in despair.
The highest and purest portion of matter, which nourishes and constitutes divine existences, is what the
poets term nectar, the beverage of the Gods. The lower, more disturbed and grosser portion, is what intoxicates souls. The ancients symbolized it as the River Lethe, dark stream of oblivion. How do we
explain the soul's forgetfulness of its antecedents, or reconcile that utter absence of remembrance of its former condition, with its essential immortality? In truth, we for the most part dread and shrink from
any attempt at explanation of it to ourselves.
Dragged down by the heaviness produced by this inebriating draught, the soul falls along the zodiac and the milky way to the lower spheres, and in its descent not only takes, in each sphere, a new
envelope of the material composing the luminous bodies of the planets, but receives there the different faculties which it is to exercise while it inhabits the body.
In Saturn, it acquires the power of reasoning and intelligence, or what is termed the logical and
contemplative faculty. From Jupiter it receives the power of action. Mars gives it valor, enterprise, and impetuosity. From the Sun it receives the senses and imagination, which produce sensation, perception,
and thought. Venus inspires it with desires. Mercury gives it the faculty of expressing and enunciating what it thinks and feels. And, on entering the sphere of the Moon, it acquires the force of generation
and growth. This lunary sphere, lowest and basest to divine bodies, is first and highest to terrestrial bodies. And the lunary body there assumed by the soul, while, as it were, the sediment of celestial
matter, is also the first substance of animal matter.

The celestial bodies, Heaven, the Stars, and the other Divine elements, ever aspire to rise. The soul reaching the region which mortality inhabits, tends toward terrestrial bodies, and is deemed to die. Let
no one, says Macrobius, be surprised that we so frequently speak of the death of this soul, which yet we call immortal. It is neither annulled nor destroyed by such death: but merely enfeebled for a time; and
does not thereby forfeit its prerogative of immortality; for afterward, freed from the body, when it has been purified from the vicestains contracted during that connection, it is reestablished in all its
privileges, and returns to the luminous abode of its immortality.
On its return, it restores to each sphere through which it ascends, the passions and earthly faculties received from them to the Moon, the faculty of increase and diminution of the body; to Mercury, fraud,
the architect of evils; to Venus, the seductive love of pleasure; to the Sun, the passion for greatness and empire; to Mars, audacity and temerity; to Jupiter, avarice; and to Saturn, falsehood and deceit and at
last, relieved of all, it enters naked and pure into the eighth sphere or highest Heaven.
All this agrees with the doctrine of Plato, that the soul cannot reenter into Heaven, until the revolutions of the Universe shall have restored it to its primitive condition, and purified it from the effects of its
contact with the four elements.
This opinion of the preexistence of souls, as pure and celestial substances, before their union with our bodies, to put on and animate which they descend from Heaven, is one of great antiquity. A modern
Rabbi, Manasseh Ben Israel, says it was always the belief of the Hebrews. It was that of most philosophers who admitted the immortality of the soul and therefore it was taught in the Mysteries; for,
as Lactantius says, they could not see how it was possible that the soul should exist after the body, if it had and not existed before it, and if its nature was not independent of that of the body. The same
doctrine was adopted by the most learned of the Greek Fathers, and by many of the Latins: and it would probably prevail largely at the present day, if men troubled themselves to think upon this subject at all,
and to inquire whether the soul's immortality involved its prior existence.
Some philosophers held that the soul was incarcerated in the body, by way of punishment for sins committed by it in a prior state. How they reconciled this with the same soul's unconsciousness of any
such prior state, or of sin committed there, does not appear. Others held that God, of his mere will, sent the soul to inhabit the body. The Kabalists united the two opinions. They held that there are four worlds,
Aziluth, Briarth, Jezirath, and Aziath; the world of emanation, that of creation, that of forms, and the material world; one above and more perfect than the other, in that order, both as regards their own
nature and that of the beings who inhabit them. All souls are originally in the world Aziluth, the Supreme Heaven, abode of God, and of pure and immortal spirits.
Those who descend from it without fault of their own, by God's order, are gifted with a divine fire,

which preserves them from the contagion of matter, and restores them to Heaven so soon as their mission is ended.
Those who descend through their own fault, go from world to world, insensibly losing their love of
Divine things, and their selfcontemplation; until they reach the world Aziath, falling by their own weight. This is a pure Platonism, clothed with the images and words peculiar to the Kabalists. It was the
doctrine of the Essenes, who, says Porphyry, "believe that souls descend from the most subtile ether, attracted to bodies by the seductions of matter."
It was in substance the doctrine of Origen; and it came from the Chald�ans, who largely studied the
theory of the Heavens, the spheres, and the influences of the signs and constellations.
The Gnostics made souls ascend and descend through eight Heavens, in each of which were certain Powers that opposed their return, and often drove them back to earth, when not sufficiently purified.
The last of these Powers, nearest the luminous abode of souls, was a serpent or dragon.
In the ancient doctrine, certain Genii were charged with the duty of conducting souls to the bodies destined to receive them, and of withdrawing them from those bodies. According to Plutarch, these
were the functions of Proserpine and Mercury. In Plato, a familiar Genius accompanies man at his birth, follows and watches him all his life, and at death conducts him to the tribunal of the Great judge.
These Genii are the media of communication between man and the Gods; and the soul is ever in their presence. This doctrine is taught in the oracles of Zoroaster and these Genii were the Intelligences that
resided in the planets.
Thus the secret science and mysterious emblems of initiation were connected with the Heavens, the Spheres, and the Constellations and this connection must be studied by whomsoever would understand
the ancient mind, and be enabled to interpret the allegories, and explore the meaning of the symbols, in which the old sages endeavored to delineate the ideas that struggled within them for utterance, and
could be but insufficiently and inadequately expressed by language, whose words are images of those things alone that can be grasped by and are within the empire of the senses.
It is not possible for us thoroughly to appreciate the, feelings with which the ancients regarded the
Heavenly bodies, and the ideas to which their observation of the Heavens gave rise, because we cannot put ourselves in their places, look at the stars with their eyes in the world's youth, and divest ourselves
of the knowledge which even the commonest of us have, that makes us regard the Stars and Planets and all the Universe of Suns and Worlds, as a mere inanimate machine and aggregate of senseless orbs, no
more astonishing, except in degree, than a clock or an orrery. We wonder and are amazed at the Power and Wisdom (to most men it seems only a kind of Infinite Ingenuity) of the MAKER: they wondered at

the Work, and endowed it with Life and Force and mysterious Powers and mighty Influences.
Memphis, in Egypt, was in Latitude 29� 5" North, and in Longitude 30� 18' East. Theb�, in Upper
Egypt, in Latitude 25� 45' North, and Longitude 32� 43' East. Babylon was in Latitude 32� 30'
North, and Longitude 44� 23' East: while Saba, the ancient with Sab�an capital of Ethiopia, was
about in Latitude 15� North.
Through Egypt ran the great River Nile, coming from beyond Ethiopia, its source in regions wholly
unknown, in the abodes of heat and fire, and its course from South to North. Its inundations had formed the alluvial lands of Upper and Lower Egypt, which they continued to raise higher and higher, and to
fertilize by their deposits. At first, as in all newlysettled countries, those inundations, occurring annually and always at the same period of the year, were calamities until, by means of levees and drains
and artificial lakes for irrigation, they became blessings, and were looked for with joyful anticipation, as they had before been awaited with terror. Upon the deposit left by the Sacred River, as it withdrew
into its banks, the husbandman sowed his seed; and the rich soil and the genial sun insured him an abundant harvest.
Babylon lay on the Euphrates, which ran from Southeast to Northwest, blessing, as all rivers in the
Orient do, the arid country through which it flowed; but its rapid and uncertain overflows bringing terror and disaster.
To the ancients, as yet inventors of no astronomical instruments, and looking at the Heavens with the
eyes of children, this earth was a level plain of unknown extent. About its boundaries there was speculation, but no knowledge. The inequalities of its surface were the irregularities of a plane.
That it was a globe, or that anything lived on its under surface, or on what it rested they had no idea.
Every twentyfour hours the sun came up from beyond the Eastern rim of the world, and travelled across the sky, over the earth, always South of, but sometimes nearer and sometimes further from the
point overhead; and sunk below the world's Western rim. With him went light, and after him followed darkness.
And every twentyfour hours appeared in the Heavens another body, visible chiefly at night, but
sometimes even when the sun shone, which likewise, as if following the sun at a greater or less distance, travelled across the sky; sometimes as a thin crescent, and thence increasing to a full orb
resplendent with silver light; and sometimes more and sometimes less to the Southward of the point overhead, within the same limits as the Sun.

Man, enveloped by the thick darkness of profoundest night, when everything around him has disappeared, and he seems alone with himself and the black shades that surround him, feels his
existence a blank and nothingness, except so far as memory recalls him the glories and splendors of light. Everything is dead to him, and he, as it were, to Nature. How crushing and overwhelming the
thought, the fear, the dread, that perhaps that darkness may be eternal, and that day may possibly never return; if it ever occurs to his mind, while the solid gloom closes up against him like a wall! What then
can restore him to like, to energy, to activity, to fellowship and communion with the great world which God has spread around him, and which perhaps in the darkness may be passing away? LIGHT restores
him to himself and to nature which seemed lost to him. Naturally, therefore, the primitive men regarded light as the principle of their real existence, without which life would be but one continued weariness
and despair. This necessity for light, and its actual creative energy, were felt by all men: and nothing was more alarming to them than its absence. It became their first Divinity, a single ray of which,
flashing into the dark tumultuous bosom of chaos, caused man and all the Universe to emerge from it. So all the poets sung who imagined Cosmogonies; such was the first dogma of Orpheus, Moses, and
the Theologians. Light was Ormuzd, adored by the Persians, and Darkness Ahriman, origin of all evils. Light was the life of the Universe, the friend of man, the substance of the Gods and of the Soul.
The sky was to them a great, solid, concave arch; a hemisphere of unknown material, at an unknown
distance above the flat level earth; and along it journeyed in their courses the Sun, the Moon, the Planets, and the Stars.
The Sun was to them a great globe of fire, of unknown dimensions, at an unknown distance. The Moon
was a mass of softer light; the stars and planets lucent bodies, armed with unknown and supernatural influences.
It could not fail to be soon observed, that at regular intervals the days and nights were equal; and that
two of these intervals measured the same space of time as elapsed between the successive inundations, and between the returns of springtime and harvest. Nor could it fail to be perceived that the changes of
the moon occurred regularly; the same number of days always elapsing between the first appearance of her silver crescent in the West at evening and that of her full orb rising in the East at the same hour; and
the same again, between that and the new appearance of the crescent in the West.
It was also soon observed that the Sun crossed the Heavens in a different line each day, the days being longest and the nights shortest when the line of his passage was furthest North, and the days shortest
and nights longest when that line was furthest South that his progress North and South was perfectly regular, marking four periods that were always the same, those when the days and nights were equal, or
the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes; that when the days were longest, or the Summer Solstice; and that when they were shortest, or the Winter Solstice.

With the Vernal Equinox, or about the 25th of March of our Calendar, they found that there unerringly came soft winds, the return of warmth, caused by the Sun turning back to the Northward from the
middle ground of his course, the vegetation of the new year, and the impulse to amatory action on the part of the animal creation. Then the Bull and the Ram, animals most valuable to the agriculturist, and
symbols themselves of vigorous generative power, recovered their vigor, the birds mated and builded their nests, the seeds germinated, the grass grew, and the trees put forth leaves. With the Summer
Solstice, when the Sun reached the extreme northern limit of his course, came great heat, and burning winds, and lassitude and exhaustion; then vegetation withered, man longed for the cool breezes of
Spring and Autumn, and the cool water of the wintry Nile or Euphrates, and the Lion sought for that element far from his home in the desert.
With the Autumnal Equinox came ripe harvests, and fruits of the tree and vine, and falling leaves, and
cold evenings presaging wintry frosts; and the Principle and Powers of Darkness, prevailing over those of Light, drove the Sun further to the South, so that the nights grew longer than the days. And at the
Winter Solstice the earth was wrinkled with frost, the trees were leafless, and the Sun, reaching the most Southern point in his career, seemed to hesitate whether to continue descending, to leave the
world to darkness and despair, or to turn upon his steps and retrace his course to the Northward, bringing back seedtime and Spring, and green leaves and flowers, and all the delights of love.
Thus, naturally and necessarily, time was divided, first into days, and then into moons or months, and
years; and with these divisions and the movements of the Heavenly bodies that marked them, were associated and connected all men's physical enjoyments and privations. Wholly agricultural, and in
their frail habitations greatly at the mercy of the elements and the changing seasons, the primitive people of the Orient were most deeply interested in the recurrence of the periodical phenomena
presented by the two great luminaries of Heaven, on whose regularity all their prosperity depended.
And the attentive observer soon noticed that the smaller lights of Heaven were, apparently, even more regular than the Sun and Moon, and foretold with unerring certainty, by their risings and settings, the
periods of recurrence of the different phenomena and seasons on which the physical wellbeing of all men depended. They soon felt the necessity of distinguishing the individual stars, or groups of stars,
and giving them names, that they might understand each other, when referring to and designating them. Necessity produced designations at once natural and artificial. Observing that, in the circle of the year,
the renewal and periodical appearance of the productions of the earth were constantly associated, not only with the courses of the Sun, but also with the rising and setting of certain Stars, and with their
position relatively to the Sun, the centre to which they referred the whole starry host, the mind naturally connected the celestial and terrestrial objects that were in fact connected and they commenced by
giving to particular Stars or groups of Stars the names of those terrestrial objects which seemed connected with them and for those which still remained unnamed by this nomenclature, they, to
complete a system, assumed arbitrary and fanciful names.

Thus the Ethiopian of Thebes or Saba styled those Stars under which the Nile commenced to overflow, Stars of Inundation, or that poured out water (AQUARIUS).
Those Stars among which the Sun was, when he had reached the Northern Tropic and began to retreat
Southward, were termed, from his retrograde motion, the Crab (CANCER).
As he approached, in Autumn, the middle point between the Northern and Southern extremes of his journeying, the days and nights became equal; and the Stars among which he was then found were
called Stars of the Balance (LIBRA).
Those stars among which the Sun was, when the Lion, driven from the Desert by thirst, came to slake it at the Nile, were called Stars of the Lion (LEO).
Those among which the Sun was at harvest, were called those of the Gleaning Virgin, holding a Sheaf
of Wheat (VIRGO).
Those among which he was found in February, when the Ewes brought forth their young, were called Stars of the Lamb (ARIES).
Those in March, when it was time to plough, were called Stars of the Ox (TAURUS).
Those under which hot and burning winds came from the desert, venomous like poisonous reptiles,
were called Stars of the Scorpion (SCORPIO).
Observing that the annual return of the rising of the Nile was always accompanied by the appearance of a beautiful Star, which at that period showed itself in the direction of the sources of that river, and
seemed to warn the husbandman to be careful not to be surprised by the inundation, the Ethiopian compared this act of that Star to that of the Animal which by barking gives warning of danger, and
styled it the Dog (SIRIUS).
Thus commencing, and as astronomy came to be more studied, imaginary figures were traced all over the Heavens, to which the different Stars were assigned. Chief among them were those that lay along
the path which the Sun travelled as he climbed toward the North and descended to the South: lying within certain limits and extending to an equal distance on each side of the line of equal nights and
days. This belt, curving like a Serpent, was termed the Zodiac, and divided into twelve Signs.

At the Vernal Equinox, 2455 years before our Era, the Sun was entering the sign and constellation
Taurus, or the Bull; having passed through, since he commenced, at the Winter Solstice, to ascend Northward. the Signs Aquarius, Pisces and Aries; on entering the first of which he reached the lowest
limit of his journey Southward.
From TAURUS, he passed through Gemini and Cancer, and reached LEO when he arrived at the terminus of his journey Northward. Thence, through Leo, Virgo, and Libra, he entered SCORPIO at the
Autumnal Equinox, and journeyed Southward through Scorpia, Sagittarius, and Capricorn to AQUARIUS, the terminus of his journey South.
The path by which he journeyed through these signs became the Ecliptic; and that which passes through
the two equinoxes, the Equator.
They knew nothing of the immutable laws of nature; and whenever the Sun commenced to tend Southward, they feared lest he might continue to do so, and by degrees disappear forever, leaving the
earth to be ruled forever by darkness, storm, and cold.
Hence they rejoiced when he commenced to reascend after the Winter Solstice, struggling against the malign influences of Aquarius and Pisces, and amicably received by the Lamb. And when at the Vernal
Equinox he entered Taurus, they still more rejoiced at the assurance that the days would again be longer than the nights, that the season of seedtime had come, and the Summer and harvest would follow.
And they lamented when, after the Autumnal Equinox, the malign influence of the venomous Scorpion,
and vindictive Archer, and the filthy and illomened HeGoat dragged him down toward the Winter Solstice.
Arriving there, they said he had been slain, and had gone to the realm of darkness. Remaining there
three days, he rose again, and again ascended Northward in the heavens, to redeem the earth from the gloom and darkness of Winter, which soon became emblematical of sin, and evil, and suffering; as the
Spring, Summer, and Autumn became emblems of happiness and immortality.
Soon they personified the Sun, and worshipped him under the name of OSIRIS, and transmuted the legend of his descent among the Winter Signs, into a fable of his death, his descent into the infernal
regions, and his resurrection.

The Moon became Isis, the wife of Osiris; and Winter, as well as the desert or the ocean into which the Sun descended, became TYPHON, the Spirit or Principle of Evil, warring against and destroying
Osiris.
From the journey of the Sun through the twelve signs came the legend of the twelve labors of Hercules,
and the incarnations of Vishnu and Buddha. Hence came the legend of the murder of Kh�r�m,
representative of the Sun, by the three Fellowcrafts, symbols of the three Winter signs, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces, who assailed him at the three gates of Heaven and slew him at the Winter
Solstice. Hence the search for him by the nine Fellowcrafts, the other nine signs, his finding, burial, and resurrection.
The celestial Taurus, opening the new year, was the Creative of Bull of the Hindus and Japanese,
breaking with his horn the egg out of which the world is born. Hence the bull APIS was worshipped by the Egyptians, and reproduced as a golden calf by Aaron in the desert. Hence the cow was sacred to the
Hindus. Hence, from the sacred and beneficent signs of Taurus and Leo, the humanheaded winged lions and bulls in the palaces at Kouyounjik and Nimroud, like which were the Cherubim set by
Solomen in his Temple: and hence the twelve brazen or bronze oxen, on which the layer of brass was supported.
The Celestial Vulture or Eagle, rising and setting with the Scorpion, was substituted in its place, in
many cases, on account of the malign influences of the latter and thus the four great periods the of the year were mailed by the Bull, the Lion, the Man (Aquarius) and the Eagle; which were upon the
respective standards of Ephraim, Judah, Reuben, and Dan; and still appear on the shield of American Royal Arch Masonry.
Afterward the Ram or Lamb became an object of adoration, when in his turn, he opened the equinox, to
deliver the world from the wintry reign of darkness and evil.
Around the central and simple idea of the annual death and resurrection of the Sun a multitude of circumstantial details soon clustered. Some were derived from other astronomical phenomena; while
many were merely poetical ornaments and inventions.
Besides the Sun and Moon, those ancients also saw a beautiful Star, shining with a soft, silvery light, always following the Sun at no great distance when he set, or preceding him when he rose. Another of a
red and angry color, and still another more kingly and brilliant than all, early attracted their attention, by their free movements among the fixed hosts of Heaven and the latter by his unusual brilliancy, and
the regularity with which he rose and set, These were Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Mercury and Saturn could scarcely have been noticed in the world's infancy, or until astronomy began to assume the

proportions of a science.
In the projection of the celestial sphere by the astronomical priests, the zodiac and constellations, arranged in a circle, presented their halves in diametrical opposition; and the hemisphere of Winter was
said to be adverse, opposed, contrary, to that of slew him Summer. Over the angels of the latter ruled a king (OSIRIS or ORMUZD), enlightened, intelligent, creative, and beneficent. Over the fallen angels or
evil genii of the former, the demons or Devs of the subterranean empire of darkness and sorrow, and its stars, ruled also a chief. In Egypt the Scorpion first ruled, the sign next the Balance, and long the chief
of the Winter signs; and then the Polar Bear or Ass, called Typhon, that is, deluge, on account of the rains which inundated the earth while that constellation domineered. In Persia, at a later day, it was the
serpent, which, personified as Ahriman, was the Evil Principle of the religion of Zoroaster.
The Sun does not arrive at the same moment in each year at the equinoctial point on the equator. The explanation of his anticipating that point belongs to the science of astronomy; and to that we refer you
for it. The consequence is, what is termed the precession of the equinoxes, by means of which the Sun is constantly changing his place in the zodiac, at each vernal equinox; so that now, the signs retaining
the names which they had 300 years before Christ, they and the constellations do not correspond; the Sun being, now in the constellation Pisces, when he is in the sign Aries.
The annual amount of precession is 50 seconds and a little over [50" 1]. The period of a complete
Revolution of the Equinoxes, 25,856 years. The precession amounts to 30� or a sign, in 2155.6 years. So that, as the sun now enters Pisces at the Vernal Equinox, he entered Aries at that period, 300 years
B.C., and Taurus 2455 B.C. And the division of the Ecliptic, now called Taurus, lies in the Constellation Aries; while the sign Gemini is in the Constellation Taurus. Four thousand six hundred
and ten years before Christ, the sun entered Gemini at the Vernal Equinox.
At the two periods, 2455 and 300 years before Christ and now, the entrances of the sun at the Equinoxes and Solstices into the signs, were and are as follows:

From confounding signs with causes came the worship of the sun and stars. "If," says job, "I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon progressive in brightness; and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or
my mouth hath kissed my hand, this were an iniquity to be punished by the judge; for I should have denied the God that is above."
Perhaps we are not, on the whole, much wiser than those simple men of the old time. For what do we
know of effect and cause, except that one thing regularly or habitually follows another?
So, because the heliacal rising of Sirius preceded the rising of the Nile, it was deemed to cause it; and other stars were in like manner held to cause extreme heat, bitter cold, and watery storm.

A religious reverence for the zodiacal Bull [TAURUS] appears, from a very early period, to have been
pretty general, perhaps it was universal, throughout Asia; from that chain or region of Caucasus to which it gave name; and which is still known under the appellation of Mount Taurus, to the Southern
extremities of the Indian Peninsula; extending itself also into Europe, and through the Eastern parts of Africa.
This evidently originated during those remote ages of the world, when the colure of the vernal equinox
passed across the stars in the head of the sign from Aries.

Taurus [among which was Aldebar�n]; a period when, as the most ancient monuments of all the
oriental nations attest, the light of arts and letters first shone forth. The Arabian word ALDE
BAR�N, means the foremost, or leading star and it could only have been so named, when it did
precede, or lead, all others. The year then opened with the sun in Taurus; and the multitude of ancient sculptures, both in Assyria and Egypt, wherein the bull appears with lunette or crescent horns, and the
disk of the sun between them, are direct allusions to the important festival of the first new moon of the year: and there was everywhere an annual celebration of the festival of the first new moon, when the
year opened with Sol and Luna in Taurus.
David sings: "Blow the trumpet in the New Moon; in the time appointed; on our solemn feastday: for this is a statute unto Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. This he ordained to Joseph, for a testimony,
when he came out of the land of Egypt."

The reverence paid to Taurus continued long after, by the precession of the Equinoxes, the colure of the vernal equinox had come to pass through Aries. The Chinese still have a temple, called "The Palace of
the horned Bull" and the same symbol is worshipped in Japan and all over Hindostan. The Cimbrians carried a brazen bull with them, as the image of their God, when they overran Spain and Gaul; and the
representation of the Creation, by the Deity in the shape of a bull, breaking the shell of an egg with his horns, meant Taurus, opening the year, and bursting the symbolical shell of the annuallyrecurring orb
of the new year.
Theophilus says that the Osiris of Egypt was supposed to be dead or absent fifty days in each year.
Landseer thinks that this was because the Sab�an priests were accustomed to see, in the lower
latitudes of Egypt and Ethiopia, the first or chief stars of the Husbandman [BO�TES] sink achronically beneath the Western horizon; and then to begin their lamentations, or hold forth the signal
for others to weep: and when his prolific virtues were supposed to be transferred to the vernal sun, bacchanalian revelry became devotion.
Before the colure of the Vernal Equinox had passed into Aries, and after it had left Aldebar�n and the
Hyades, the Pleiades were, for seven or eight centuries, the leading stars of the Sab�an year. And thus we see, on the monuments, the disk and crescent, symbols of the sun and moon in conjunction, appear
successively, first on the head, and then on the neck and back of the
Zodiacal Bull, and more recently on the forehead of the Ram.
The diagrammatical character or symbol, still in use to denote Taurus, is this very crescent and disk a
symbol that has come down to us from those remote ages when this memorable conjunction in Taurus,
by marking the commencement, at once of the Sab�an year and of the cycle of the Chaldean Saros, so
preeminently distinguished that sign as to become its characteristic symbol. On a bronze bull from China, the crescent is attached to the back of the Bull, by means of a cloud, and a curved groove is
provided for the occasional introduction of the disk of the sun, when solar and lunar time were coincident and conjunctive, at the commencement of the year, and of the lunar cycle. When that was
made, the year did not open with the stars in the head of the Bull, but when the colure of the vernal equinox passed across the middle or later degrees of the asterism Taurus, and the Pleiades were, in
China, as in Canaan, the leading stars of the year.
The crescent and disk combined always represent the conjunctive Sun and Moon; and when placed on the head of the Zodiacal Bull, the commencement of the cycle termed SAROS by the Chaldeans, and
Metonic by the Greeks; and supposed to be alluded to in job, by the phrase, "Mazzaroth in his season"; that is to say, when the first new Moon and new Sun of the year were coincident, which happened once
in eighteen years and a fraction.

On the sarcophagus of Alexander, the same symbol appears on the head of a Ram, which, in the time of that monarch, was the leading sign. So too in the sculptured temples of the Upper Nile, the crescent and
disk appear, not on the head of Taurus, but on the forehead of the Ram or the Ramheaded God, whom the Grecian Mythologists called Jupiter Ammon, really the Sun in Aries.
If we now look for a moment at the individual stars which composed and were near to the respective
constellations, we may find something that will connect itself with the symbols of the Ancient Mysteries and of Masonry.
It is to be noticed that when the Sun is in a particular constellation, no part of that constellation will be
seen, except just before sunrise and just after sunset; and then only the edge of it: but the constellations opposite to it will be visible. When the Sun is in Taurus, for example, that is, when Taurus sets with the
Sun, Scorpio rises as he sets, and continues visible throughout the night. And if Taurus rises and sets with the Sun today, he will, six months hence, rise at sunset and set at sunrise; for the stars thus gain on
the Sun two hours a month.
Going back to the time when, watched by the Chaldean shepherds, and the husbandmen of Ethiopia and Egypt, "The milkwhite Pull with golden horns "Led on the newborn year," we see in the neck of
TAURUS, the Pleiades, and in his face the Hyades, "which Grecia from their showering names," and of
whom the brilliant Aldebar�n is the chief; while to the southwestward is that most splendid of all the
constellations, Orion, with Betelgueux in his right shoulder, Bellatrix in his left shoulder, Rigel on the left foot, and in his belt the three stars known as the Three Kings, and now as the Yard and Ell. Orion,
ran the legend, persecuted the Pleiades; and to save them from his fury, Jupiter placed them in the Heavens, where he still pursues them, but in vain. They, with Arcturus and the Bands of Orion, are
mentioned in the Book of Job. They are usually called the Seven Stars, and it is said there were seven, before the fall of Troy; though now only six are visible.
The Pleiades were so named from a Greek word signifying to sail. In all ages they have been observed
for signs and seasons. Virgil says that the sailors gave names to "the Pleiades, Hyades, and the Northern Car Pleiadas, Hyadas, Claramque Lycaonis Arcton." And Palinurus, he says, Arcturum, pluviasque
Hyadas, Geminosque Triones, Armatumque auro circumspicit Oriona studied Arcturus and the rainy Hyades and the Twin Triones, and Orion cinctured with gold. Taurus was the prince and leader of the
celestial host for more than two thousand years; and when his head set with the Sun about the last of May, the Scorpion was seen to rise in the Southeast.
The Pleiades were sometimes called Vergili�, or the Virgins of Spring; because the Sun entered this
cluster of stars in the season of blossoms. Their Syrian name was Succoth, or Succothbeneth, derived from a Chaldean word signifying to speculate or observe.

The Hyades are five stars in the form of a V, 11� southeast of the Pleiades. The Greeks counted them
as seven. When the Vernal Equinox was in Taurus, Aldebar�n led up the starry host; and as he rose in
the East, Aries was about 27� high.
When he was close upon the meridian, the Heavens presented their most magnificent appearance.
Capella was a little further from the meridian, to the north; and Orion still further from it to the southward. Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux had climbed about halfway from the horizon to the
meridian.
Regulus had just risen upon the ecliptic. The Virgin still lingered below the horizon. Fomalhaut was halfway to the meridian in the Southwest; and to the Northwest were the brilliant constellations,
Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Andromeda; while the Pleiades had just passed the meridian.
ORION is visible to all the habitable world. The equinoctial line passes through the centre of it. When
Aldebar�n rose in the East, the Three Kings in Orion followed him; and as Taurus set, the Scorpion,
by whose sting it was said Orion died, rose in the East.
Orion rises at noon about the 9th of March. His rising was accompanied with great rains and storms, and it became very terrible to mariners.
In Bo�tes, called by the ancient Greeks Lycaon, from lukos, a wolf, and by the Hebrews, Caleb
Anubach, the Barking Dog, is the Great Star ARCTURUS, which, when Taurus opened the year, corresponded with a season remarkable for its great heat.
Next comes GEMINI, the Twins, two human figures, in the heads of which are the bright Stars
CASTOR and POLLUX, the Dioscuri, and the Cabiri of Samothrace, patrons of navigation; while South of Pollux are the brilliant Stars SIRIUS and PROCYON, the greater and lesser Dog and still
further South, Canopus, in the Ship Argo.
Sirius is apparently the largest and brightest Star in the Heavens. When the Vernal Equinox was in Taurus, he rose heliacally, that is, just before the Sun, when, at the Summer Solstice, the Sun entered
Leo, about the 21st of June, fifteen days previous to the swelling of the Nile. The heliacal rising of Canopus was also a precursor of the rising of the Nile. Procyon was the forerunner of Sirius, and rose
before him.

There are no important Stars in CANCER. In the Zodiacs of Esne and Dendera, and in most of the
astrological remains of Egypt, the sign of this constellation was a beetle (Scarab�us), which
thence became sacred, as an emblem of the gate through which souls descended from Heaven. In the
crest of Cancer is a cluster of Stars formerly called Pr�sepe, the Manger, on each side of which is a
small Star, the two of which were called Aselli little asses.
In Leo are the splendid Stars, REGULUS, directly on the ecliptic, and DENEBOLA in the Lion's tail.
Southeast of Regulus is the fine Star COR HYDR�.
The combat of Hercules with the Nem�an lion was his first labor. It was the first sign into which the
Sun passed, after falling below the Summer Solstice; from which time he struggled to reascend.
The Nile overflowed in this sign. It stands first in the Zodiac of Dendera, and is in all the Indian and Egyptian Zodiacs.
In the left hand of VIRGO (Isis or Ceres) is the beautiful Star SPICA Virginis, a little South of the
ecliptic. VINDEMIATRIX, of less magnitude, is in the right arm; and Northwest of Spica, in Bo�tes (the husbandman, Osiris), is the splendid star ARCTURUS.
The division of the first Decan of the Virgin, Aben Ezra says, represents a beautiful Virgin with
flowing hair, sitting in a chair, with two ears of corn in her hand, and suckling an infant. In an Arabian MS. in the Royal Library at Paris, is a picture of the Twelve Signs. That of Virgo is a young girl with an
infant by her side. Virgo was Isis and her representation carrying a child (Horus) in her arms, exhibited in her temple, was accompanied by this inscription: "I AM ALL THAT IS, THAT WAS, AND THAT
SHALL BE; and the fruit which I brought forth is the Sun."
Nine months after the Sun enters Virgo, he reaches the Twins. When Scorpio begins to rise, Orion sets: when Scorpio comes to the meridian, Leo begins to set, Typhon reigns, Osiris is slain, and Isis (the
Virgin) his sister and wife, follows him to the tomb, weeping.
The Virgin and Bo�tes, setting heliacally at the Autumnal Equinox, delivered the world to the wintry constellations, and introduced into it the genius of Evil, represented by Ophiucus, the Serpent.
At the moment of the Winter Solstice, the Virgin rose heliacally (with the Sun), having the Sun (Horus)
in her bosom.

In LIBRA are four Stars of the second and third magnitude, which we shall mention hereafter. They are
ZubenesChamali, ZubenelGemabi, Zubenhakrabi, and ZubenelGubi. Near the last of these is the brilliant and malign Star, ANTARES in Scorpio.
In SCORPIO, ANTARES, of the 1st magnitude, and remarkably red, was one of the four great Stars,
FOMALHAUT, in Cetus, ALDEBARAN in Taurus, REGULUS in Leo, and ANTARES, that formerly answered to the Solstitial and Equinoctial points, and were much noticed by astronomers.
This sign was sometimes represented by a Snake, and sometimes by a Crocodile, but generally by a
Scorpion, which last is found on the Mithriac Monuments, and on the Zodiac of Dendera. It was considered a sign accursed, and the entrance of the Sun into it commenced the reign of Typhon.
In Sagittarius, Capricornus, and Aquarius there are no Stars of importance.
Near Pisces is the brilliant Star FOMALHAUT. No sign in the Zodiac is considered of more malignant
influence than this. It was deemed indicative of Violence and Death. Both the Syrians and Egyptians abstained from eating fish, out of dread and abhorrence; and when the latter would represent anything
as odious, or express hatred by Hieroglyphics, they painted a fish.
In Auriga is the bright Star CAPELLA, which to the Egyptians never set. And, circling ever round the North Pole are Seven Stars, known as Ursa Major, or the Great Bear, which have been an object of
universal observation in all ages of the world. They were venerated alike by the Priests of Bel, the Magi
of Persia, the Shepherds of Chaldea, and the Ph�nician navigators, as well as by the astronomers of
Egypt. Two of them, MERAK and DUBHE, always point to the North Pole.
The Ph�nician and Egyptians, says Eusebius, were the first who ascribed divinity to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and regarded them as the sole causes of the production and destruction of all beings. From
them went abroad over all the world all known opinions as to the generation and descent of the Gods. Only the Hebrews looked beyond the visible world to an invisible Creator. All the rest of the world
regarded as Gods those luminous bodies that blaze in the firmament, offered them sacrifices, bowed down before them, and raised neither their souls nor their worship above the visible heavens.
The Chaldeans, Canaanites, and Syrians, among whom Abraham lived, did the same. The Canaanites
consecrated horses and chariots to the Sun. The inhabitants of Emesa in Ph�nician adored him under the name of Elagabalus; and the Sun, as Hercules, was the great Deity of the Tyrians. The Syrians

351/641
worshipped, with fear and dread, the Stars of the Constellation Pisces, and consecrated images of them in their temples.
The Sun as Adonis was worshipped in Byblos and about Mount Libanus. There was a magnificent
Temple of the Sun at Palmyra, which was pillaged by the soldiers of Aurelian, who rebuilt it and dedicated it anew. The Pleiades, under the name of SuccothBeneth, were worshipped by the
Babylonian colonists who settled in the country of the Samaritans. Saturn, under the name of Remphan, was worshipped among the Copts. The planet Jupiter was worshipped as Bel or Baal; Mars as Malec,
Melech, or Moloch; Venus as Ashtaroth or Astarte, and Mercury as Nebo, among the Syrians,
Assyrians, Ph�nicians, and Canaanites. Sanchoniathon says that the earliest Phoenicians adored the
Sun, whom they deemed sole Lord of the Heavens; and honored him under the name of BEELSAMIN, signifying King of Heaven. They raised columns to the elements, fire, and air or wind, and worshipped
them; and Sab�ism, or the worship of the Stars, flourished everywhere in Babylonia. The Arabs, under a sky always clear and serene, adored the Sun, Moon, and Stars.
Abulfaragius so informs us, and that each of the twelve Arab Tribes invoked a particular Star as its
Patron. The Tribe Hamyar was consecrated to the Sun, the Tribe Cennah to the Moon; the Tribe Misa
was under the protection of the beautiful Star in Taurus, Aldebar�n; the Tribe Tai under that of
Canopus; the Tribe Kais, of Sirius; the Tribes Lachamus and Idamus, of Jupiter; the Tribe Asad, of Mercury; and so on.
The Saracens, in the time of Heraclius, worshipped Venus, whom they called CABAR, or The Great;
and they swore by the Sun, Moon, and Stars. Shahristan, an Arabic author, says that the Arabs and Indians before his time had temples dedicated to the seven Planets. Abulfaragius says that the seven
great primitive nations, from whom all others descended, the Persians, Chald�ans, Greeks, Egyptians,
Turks, Indians, and Chinese, all originally were Sab�ists, and worshipped the Stars.
They all, he says, like the Chald�ans, prayed turning toward the North Pole three times a day, at
Sunrise, Noon, and Sunset, bowing themselves three times before the Sun. They invoked the Stars and the Intelligences which inhabited them, offered them sacrifices, and called the fixed stars and planets
gods. Philo says that the Chald�ans regarded the stars as sovereign arbiters of the order of the world, and did not look beyond the visible causes to any invisible and intellectual being. They regarded
NATURE as the great divinity, that exercised its powers through the action of its parts, the Sun, Moon, Planets, and Fixed Stars, the successive revolutions of the seasons, and the combined action of Heaven
and Earth. The great feast of the Sab�ans was when the Sun reached the Vernal Equinox: and they had five other feasts, at the times when the five minor planets entered the signs in which they had their
exaltation.

Diodorus Siculus informs us that the Egyptians recognized two great Divinities, primary and eternal, the Sun and Moon, which they thought governed the world, and from which everything receives its
nourishment and growth: that on them depended all and the great work of generation, and the perfection of all effects produced in nature. We know that the two great Divinities of Egypt were Osiris
and Isis, the greatest agents of nature; according to some, the Sun and Moon, and according to others, Heaven and Earth, or the active and passive principles of generation, And we learn from Porphyry that
Ch�remon, a learned priest of Egypt, and many other learned men of that nation, said that the Egyptians recognized as gods the stars composing the zodiac, and all those that by their rising or setting
marked its divisions; the subdivisions of the signs into decans, the horoscope and the stars that presided therein, and which were called Potent Chiefs Heaven: that considering the Sun as the Great God,
Architect, and Ruler of the World, they explained not only the fable of Osiris and Isis, but generally all their sacred legends, by the stars, by their appearance and disappearance, by their ascension, by the
phases of the moon, and the increase and diminution of her, light; by the march of the sun, the division of time and the heavens into two parts, one assigned to darkness and the other to light; by the Nile and,
in fine, by the whole round of physical causes.
Lucian tells us that the bull Apis, sacred to the Egyptians, was the image of the celestial Bull, or Taurus; and that Jupiter Ammon, horned like a ram, was an image of the constellation Aries. And
Clemens of Alexandria assures us that the four principal sacred animals, carried in their processions, were emblems of the four signs or cardinal points which fixed the seasons at the equinoxes and
solstices, and divided into four parts the yearly march of the sun.
They worshipped fire also, and water, and the Nile, which river they styled Father, Preserver of Egypt, sacred emanation from the Great God Osiris; and in their hymns in which they called it the god
crowned with millet (which grain, represented by the pschent, was part of the headdress of their kings), bringing with him abundance. The other elements were also revered by them: and the Great Gods,
whose names are found inscribed on an ancient column, are the Air, Heaven, the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, Night, and Day. And, in fine, as Eusebius says, they regarded the Universe as a great Deity,
composed of a great number of gods, the different parts of itself.
The same worship of the Heavenly Host extended into every part of Europe, into Asia Minor, and among the Turks, Scythians, and Tartars. The ancient Persians adored the Sun as Mithras, and also the
Moon, Venus, Fire, Earth, Air, and Water; and, having no statues or altars, they sacrificed on high places to the Heavens and to the Sun. On seven ancient pyrea they burned incense to the Seven Planets,
and considered the elements to be divinities. In the ZendAvesta we find invocations addressed to Mithras, the stars, the elements, trees, mountains, and every part of nature. The Celestial Bull is
invoked there, to which the Moon unites herself; and the four great stars, Taschter, Satevis, Haftorang, and Venant, the great Star Rapitan, and the other constellations which watch over the different portions
of the earth.

The Magi, like a multitude of ancient nations, worshipped fire, above all the other elements and powers of nature. In India, the Ganges and the Indus were worshipped, and the Sun was the Great Divinity.
They worshipped the Moon also, and kept up the sacred fire. In Ceylon, the Sun, Moon, and other planets were worshipped: in Sumatra, the Sun, called Iri, and the Moon, called Handa. And the Chinese
built Temples to Heaven, the Earth, and genii of the air, of the water, of the mountains, and of the stars, to the seadragon, and to the planet Mars.
The celebrated Labyrinth was built in honor of the Sun; and its twelve palaces, like the twelve superb
columns of the Temple is, at Hieropolis, covered with symbols relating to the twelve signs and the occult qualities of the elements, were consecrated to the twelve gods or tutelary genii of the signs of the
Zodiac. The figure of the pyramid and that of the obelisk, resembling the shape of a flame, caused
these monuments to be consecrated to the Sun and to Fire. And Tim�us of Locria says: "The
equilateral triangle enters into the composition of the pyramid, which has four equal faces and equal angles, and which in this is like fire, the most subtle and mobile of the elements." They and the obelisks
were erected in honor of the Sun, termed in an inscription upon one of the latter, translated by the Egyptian Hermapion, and to be found in Ammianus Marcellinus, "Apollo the strong, Son of God, he
who made the world, true Lord of the diadems, who possesses Egypt and fills it with His glory."
The two most famous divisions of the Heavens, by seven, which is that of the planets, and by twelve, which is that of the signs, are found on the religious monuments of all the people of the ancient world.
The twelve Great Gods of Egypt are met with everywhere. They were adopted by the Greeks and Romans; and the latter assigned one of them to each sign of the Zodiac. Their images were seen at
Athens, where an altar was erected to each; and they were painted on the porticos. The People of the North had their twelve Azes, or Senate of twelve great gods, of whom Odin was chief. The Japanese
had the same number, and like the Egyptians divided them into classes, seven, who were the most ancient, and five, afterward added both of which numbers are well known and consecrated in Masonry.
There is no more striking proof of the universal adoration paid the stars and constellations, than the
arrangement of the Hebrew camp in the Desert, and the allegory in regard to the twelve Tribes of Israel, ascribed in the Hebrew legends to Jacob. The Hebrew camp was a quadrilateral, in sixteen divisions, of
which the central four were occupied by images of the four elements. The four divisions at the four angles of the quadrilateral exhibited the four signs that the astrologers called fixed, and which they
regard as subject to the influence of the four great Royal Stars, Regulus in Leo, Aldebaran in Taurus, Antares in Scorpio, and Fomalhaut in the mouth of Pisces, on which falls the water poured out by
Aquarius; of which constellations the Scorpion was represented in the Hebrew blazonry by the Celestial Vulture or Eagle, that rises at the same time with it and is its paranatellon. The other signs were
arranged on the four faces of the quadilateral, and in the parallel and interior divisions.
There is an astonishing coincidence between the characteristics assigned by Jacob to his sons, and those

of the signs of the Zodiac, or the planets that have their domicile in those signs.
Reuben is compared to running water, unstable, and that cannot excel; and he answers to Aquarius, his ensign being a man. The water poured out by Aquarius flows toward the South Pole, and it is the first of
the four Royal Signs, ascending from the Winter Solstice.
The Lion (Leo) is the device of Judah; and Jacob compares him to that animal, whose constellation in the Heavens is the domicile of the Sun; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah; by whose grip, when that of

Equinox, had not succeeded in raising him, Kh�r�m was lifted out of the grave.
Ephraim, on whose ensign appears the Celestial Bull, Jacob compares to the ox. Dan, bearing as his
device a Scorpion, he compares to the Cerastes or horned Serpent, synonymous in astrological language with the vulture or pouncing eagle; and which bird was often substituted on the flag of Dan, in place of
the venomous scorpion, on account of the terror which that reptile inspired, as the symbol of Typhon and his malign influences; wherefore the Eagle, as its paranatellon, that is, rising and setting at the
same time with it, was naturally used in its stead. Hence the four famous figures in the sacred pictures of the Jews and Christians, and in Royal Arch Masonry, of the Lion, the Ox, the Man, and the Eagle,
the four creatures of the Apocalypse, copied there from Ezekiel, in whose reveries and rhapsodies they are seen revolving around blazing circles.
The Ram, domicile of Mars, chief of the Celestial Soldiery and of the twelve Signs, is the device of
Gad, whom Jacob characterizes as a warrior, chief of his army.
Cancer, in which are the stars termed Aselli, or little asses, is the device of the flag of Issachar, whom Jacob compares to an ass.
Capricorn, of old represented with the tail of a fish, and called by astronomers the Son of Neptune, is
the device of Zebulon, of whom Jacob says that he dwells on the shore of the sea.
Sagittarius, chasing the Celestial Wolf, is the emblem of Benjamin, whom Jacob compares to a hunter and in that constellation the Romans placed the domicile of Diana the huntress.
Virgo, the domicile of Mercury, is borne on the flag of Naphtali, whose eloquence and agility Jacob
magnifies, both of which are attributes of the Courier of the Gods. And of Simeon and Levi he speaks as united, as are the two fishes that make the Constellation Pisces, which is their armorial emblem.

Plato, in his Republic, followed the divisions of the Zodiac and the planets. So also did Lycurgus at
Sparta, and Cecrops in the Athenian Commonwealth. Chun, the Chinese legislator, divided China into twelve Tcheou, and specially designated twelve mountains. The Etruscans divided themselves into
twelve Cantons. Romulus appointed twelve Lictors. There were twelve tribes of Ishmael and twelve disciples of the Hebrew Reformer. The New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse has twelve gates.
The Souciet, a Chinese book, speaks of a palace composed of four buildings, whose gates looked
toward the four corners of the world. That on the East was dedicated to the new moons of the months of Spring; that on the West to those of Autumn; that on the South to those of Summer; and that on the
North to those of Winter and in this, palace the Emperor and his grandees sacrificed a lamb, the animal that represented the Sun at the Vernal Equinox.
Among the Greeks, the march of the Choruses in their theatres represented the movements of the
Heavens and the planets, and the Strophe and AntiStrophe imitated, Aristoxenes says, the movements of the Stars. The number five was sacred among the Chinese, as that of the planets other than the Sun
and Moon. Astrology consecrated the numbers twelve, seven, thirty, and three hundred and sixty; and everywhere seven, the number of the planets, was as sacred as twelve, that of the signs, the months, the
oriental cycles, and the sections of the horizon. We shall speak more at large hereafter, in another Degree, as to these and other numbers, to which the ancients ascribed mysterious powers.
The Signs of the Zodiac and the Stars appeared on many of the ancient coins and medals. On the public
seal of the Locrians, Ozoles was Hesperus, or the planet Venus. On the medals of Antioch on the Orontes was the ram and crescent; and the Ram was the special Deity of Syria, assigned to it in the
division of the earth among the twelve signs. On the Cretan coins was the Equinoctial Bull; and he also appeared on those of the Mamertins and of Athens. Sagittarius appeared on those of the Persians. In
India the twelve signs appeared upon the ancient coins. The Scorpion was engraved on the medals of the Kings of Comagena, and Capricorn on those of Zeugnia, Anazorba, and other cities. On the medals
of Antoninus are found nearly all the signs of the Zodiac.
Astrology was practised among all the ancient nations. In Egypt, the book of Astrology was borne reverentially in the religious processions; in which the few sacred animals were also carried, as
emblems of the equinoxes and solstices. The same science flourished among the Chaldeans, and over the whole of Asia and Africa. When Alexander invaded India, the astrologers of the Oxydraces came to
him to disclose the secrets of their science of Heaven and the Stars. The Brahimins whom Apollonius consulted, taught him the secrets of Astronomy, with the ceremonies and prayers whereby to appease
the gods and learn the future from the stars. In China, astrology taught the mode of governing the State and families. In Arabia it was deemed the mother of the sciences; and old libraries are full of Arabic
books on this pretended science. It flourished at Rome. Constantine had his horoscope drawn by the

astrologer Valens. It was a science in the middle ages, and even to this day is neither forgotten nor unpractised.
Catherine de Medici was fond of it. Louis XIV consulted his horoscope, and the learned Casini
commenced his career as an astrologer. The ancient Sab�ans established feasts in honor of each planet, on the day, for each, when it entered its place of exaltation, or reached the particular degree in the
particular sign of the zodiac in which astrology had fixed the place of its exaltation; that is, the place in the Heavens where its influence was supposed to be greatest, and where it acted on Nature with the
greatest energy. The place of exaltation of the Sun was in Aries, because, reaching that point, he awakens all Nature, and warms into life all the germs of vegetation; and therefore his most solemn feast
among all nations, for many years before our Era, was fixed at the time of his entrance into that sign. In Egypt, it was called the Feast of Fire and Light. It was the Passover, when the Paschal Lamb was slain
and eaten, among the Jews, and Neurouz among the Persians. The Romans preferred the place of domicile to that of exaltation; and celebrated the feasts of the planets under the signs that were their
houses. The Chaldeans, whom and not the Egyptians, the Sab�ans followed in this, preferred the places of exaltation.
Saturn, from the length of time required for his apparent revolution, was considered the most remote,
and the Moon the nearest planet. After the Moon came Mercury and Venus, then the Sun, and then Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
So the risings and settings of the Fixed Stars, and their conjunctions with the Sun, and their first
appearance as they emerged from his rays, fixed the epochs for the feasts instituted in their honor; and the Sacred Calendars of the ancients were regulated accordingly.
In the Roman games of the circus, celebrated in honor of the Sun and of entire Nature, the Sun, Moon,
Planets, Zodiac, Elements, and the most apparent parts and potent agents of Nature were personified and represented, and the courses of the Sun in the Heavens were imitated in the Hippodrome; his
chariot being drawn by four horses of different colors, representing the four elements and seasons. The courses were from East to West, like the circuits round the Lodge, and seven in number, to correspond
with the number of planets. The movements of the Seven Stars that revolve around the pole were also represented, as were those of Capella, which by its heliacal rising at the moment when the Sun reached
the Pleiades, in Taurus, announced the commencement of the annual revolution of the Sun.
The intersection of the Zodiac by the colures at the Equinoctial and Solstitial points, fixed four periods, each of which has, by one or more nations, and in some cases by the same nation at different periods,
been taken for the commencement of the year. Some adopted the Vernal Equinox, because then day began to prevail over night, and light gained a victory over darkness. Sometimes the Summer Solstice

357/641
was preferred; because then day attained its maximum of duration, and the acme of its glory and perfection. In Egypt, another reason was, that then the Nile began to overflow, at the heliacal rising of
Sirius. Some preferred the Autumnal Equinox, because then the harvests were gathered, and the hopes of a new crop were deposited in the bosom of the earth. And some preferred the Winter Solstice,
because then, the shortest day having arrived, their length commenced to increase, and Light began the career destined to end in victory at the Vernal Equinox.
The Sun was figuratively said to die and be born again at the Winter Solstice; the games of the Circus,
in honor of the invincible GodSun, were then celebrated, and the Roman year estab lished or reformed by Numa, commenced. Many peoples of Italy commenced their year, Macrobius says, at that time; and
represented by the four ages of man the gradual succession of periodical increase and diminution of day, and the light of the Sun; likening him to an infant born at the Winter Solstice, a young man at the
Vernal Equinox, a robust man at the Summer Solstice, and an old man at the Autumnal Equinox.
This idea was borrowed from the Egyptians, who adored the Sun at the Winter Solstice, under the figure of an infant. The image of the Sign in which each of the four seasons commenced, became the
form under which was figured the Sun of that particular season. The Lion's skin was worn by Hercules; the horns of the Bull adorned the forehead of Bacchus; and the autumnal serpent wound its long folds
round the Statue of Serapis, 2500 years before our era; when those Signs corresponded with the commencement of the Seasons.
When other constellations replaced them at those points, by means of the precession of the Equinoxes,
those attributes were changed. Then the Ram furnished the horns for the head of the Sun, under the name of Jupiter Ammon. He was no longer born exposed to the waters of Aquarius, like Bacchus, nor
enclosed in an urn like the God Canopus; but in the Stables of Augeas or the Celestial Goat. He then completed his triumph, mounted on an ass, in the constellation Cancer, which then occupied the
Solstitial point of Summer.
Other attributes the images of the Sun borrowed from the constellations which, by their rising and setting, fixed the points of departure of the year, and the commencements of its four principal divisions.
First the Bull and afterward the Ram (called by the Persians the Lamb), was regarded as the regenerator
of Nature, through his union with the Sun. Each, in his turn, was an emblem of the Sun overcoming the winter darkness, and repairing the disorders of Nature, which every year was regenerated under these
Signs, after the Scorpion and Serpent of Autumn had brought upon it barrenness, disaster, and darkness.
Mithras was represented sitting on a Bull and that animal was an image of Osiris while the Greek

Bacchus armed his front with its horns and was pictured with its tail and feet.
The Constellations also became noteworthy to the husbandman, which by their rising or setting, at morning or evening, indicated the coming of this period of renewed fruitfulness and new life. Capella,
or the kid Amalthea, whose horn is called that of abundance, all whose place is over the equinoctial point, or Taurus; and the Pleiades, that long indicated the Seasons, and gave rise to a multitude of
poetic fables, were the most observed and most celebrated in antiquity.
The original Roman year commenced at the Vernal Equinox. July was formerly called Quintilis, the 5th month, and August Sextilis, the 6th, as September is still the 7th month, October the 8th, and so on.
The Persians commenced their year at the same time, and celebrated their great feast of Neurouz when the Sun entered Aries and the Constellation Perseus rose, Perseus, who first brought down to earth the
heavenly fire consecrated in their temples and all the ceremonies then practised reminded men of the renovation of Nature and the triumph of Ormuzd, the LightGod, over the powers of Darkness and
Ahriman their Chief.
The Legislator of the Jews fixed the commencement of their year in the month Nisan, at the Vernal Equinox, at which season the Israelites marched out of Egypt and were relieved of their long bondage;
in commemoration of which Exodus, they ate the Paschal Lamb at that Equinox. And when Bacchus and his army had long marched in burning deserts, they were led by a Lamb or Ram into beautiful
meadows, and to the Springs that watered the Temple of Jupiter Ammon. For, to the Arabs and Ethiopians, whose great Divinity Bacchus was, nothing was so perfect a type of Elysium as a Country
abounding in springs and rivulets.
Orion, on the same meridian with the Stars of Taurus, died of the sting of the celestial Scorpion, that rises when he sets; as dies the Bull of Mithras in Autumn and in the Stars that correspond with the
Autumnal Equinox we find those malevolent genii that ever war against the Principle of good, and that take from the Sun and the Heavens the fruitproducing power that they communicate to the earth.
With the Vernal Equinox, dear to the sailor as to the husbandman, came the Stars that, with the Sun,
open navigation, and rule the stormy Seas. Then the Twins plunge into the solar fires, or disappear at setting, going down with the Sun into the bosom of the waters. And these tutelary
Divinities of mariners, the Dioscuri or Chief Cahiri of Samothrace, sailed with Jason to possess themselves of the goldenfleeced ram, or Aries, whose rising in the morning announced the Sun's entry
into Taurus, when the Serpentbearer Jason rose in the evening, and, in aspect with the Dioscuri, was deemed their brother. And Orion, son of Neptune, and most potent controller of the tempesttortured
ocean, announcing sometimes calm and sometimes tempest, rose after Taurus, rejoicing in the forehead of the new year.

The Summer Solstice was not less an important point in the Sun's march than the Vernal Equinox,
especially to the Egyptians, to whom it not only marked the end and term of the increasing length of the days and of the domination of light, and the maximum of the Sun's elevation; but also the annual
recurrence of that phenomenon peculiar to Egypt, the rising of the Nile, which, ever accompanying the Sun in his course, seemed to rise and fall as the days grew longer and shorter, being lowest at the
Winter Solstice, and highest at that of Summer. Thus the Sun seemed to regulate its swelling; and the time of his arrival at the solstitial point being that of the first rising of the Nile, was selected by the
Egyptians as the beginning of a year which they called the Year of God, and of the Sothiac Period, or the period of Sothis, the DogStar, who, rising in the morning, fixed that epoch, so important to the
people of Egypt. This year was also called the Heliac, that is the Solar year, and the Canicular year; and it consisted of three hundred and sixtyfive days, without intercalation; so that at the end of four years,
or of four times three hundred and sixtyfive days, making 1460 days, it needed to add a day, to make four complete revolutions of the Sun. To correct this, some Nations made every fourth year consist, as
we do now, of 366 days: but the Egyptians preferred to add nothing to the year of 365 days, which, at the end of 120 years, or of 30 times 4 years, was short 30 days or a month; that is to say, it required a
month more to complete the 120 revolutions of the Sun, though so many were counted, that is, so many years. Of course the commencement of the 121st year would not correspond with the Summer Solstice,
but would precede it by a month: so that, when the Sun arrived at the Solstitial point whence he at first set out, and whereto he must needs return, to make in reality 120 years, or 120 complete revolutions, the
first month of the 121st year would have ended.
Thus, if the commencement of the year went back 30 days every 120 years, this commencement of the year, continuing to recede, would, at the end of 12 times 120 years, or of 1460 years, get back to the
Solstitial point, or primitive point of departure of the period. The Sun would then have made but 1459 revolutions, though 1460 were counted; to make up which, a year more would need to be added.
So that the Sun would not have made his 1460 revolutions until the end of 1461 years of 365 days each,
each revolution being in reality not 365 days exactly, but 365 �.
This period of 1461 years, each of 365 days, bringing back the commencement of the Solar year to the Solstitial point, at the rising of Sirius, after 1460 complete Solar revolutions, was called in Egypt the
Sothiac period, the point of departure whereof was the Summer Solstice, first occupied by the Lion and afterward by Cancer, under which sign is Sirius, which opened the period. It was, says Porphyry, at this
Solstitial New Moon, accompanied by the rising of Seth or the Dog Star, that the beginning of the year was fixed, and that of the generation of all things, or, as it were, the natal hour of the world.
Not Sirius alone determined the period of the rising of the Nile, Aquarius, his urn, and the stream
flowing from it, in opposition to the sign of the Summer Solstice then occupied by the Sun, opened in

the evening the march of Night, and received the full Moon in his cup.
Above him and with him rose the feet of Pegasus, struck wherewith the waters flow forth that the Muses drink. The Lion and, the Dog, indicating, were supposed to cause the inundation, and so were
worshipped. While the Sun passed through Leo, the waters doubled their depth; and the sacred fountains poured their streams through the heads of lions. Hydra, rising between Sirius and Leo,
extended under three signs. Its 'head rose with Cancer, and its tail with the feet of the Virgin and the beginning of Libra; and the inundation continued while the Sun passed along its whole extent.
The successive contest of light and darkness for the possession of the lunar disk, each being by turns
victor and vanquished, exactly resembled what passed upon the earth by he action of the Sun and his journeys from one Solstice to the other. The lunary revolution presented the same periods of light and
darkness as the year, and was the object of the same religious fictions. Above the Moon, Pliny said, everything is pure, and filled with eternal light. There ends the cone of shadow which the earth
projects, and which produces night; there ends the sojourn of night and darkness; to it the air extends; but there we enter the pure substance.
The Egyptians assigned to the Moon the demiurgic or creative force of Osiris, who united himself to
her in the spring, when the Sun communicated to her the principles of generation which she afterward disseminated in the air and all the elements. The Persians considered the Moon to have been
impregnated by the Celestial Bull, first of the signs of spring. In all ages, the Moon has been supposed to have great influence upon vegetation, and the birth and growth of animals; and the belief is as widely
entertained now as ever, and that influence regarded as a mysterious and inexplicable one. Not the astrologers alone, but Naturalists like Pliny, Philosophers like Plutarch and Cicero, Theologians like the
Egyptian Priests, and Metaphysicians like Proclus, believed firmly in these lunar influences.
"The Egyptians," says Diodorus Siculus, "acknowledged two great gods, the Sun and Moon, or Osiris and Isis, who govern the world and regulate its administration by the dispensation of the seasons.
Such is the nature of these two great Divinities, that they impress an active and fecundating force, by
which the generation of beings in effected; the Sun, by heat and that spiritual principle that forms the breath of the winds; the Moon by humidity and dryness; and both by the forces of the air which they
share in common. By this beneficial influence everything is born, grows, and vegetates. Wherefore this whole huge body, in which nature resides, is maintained by the combined action of the Sun and Moon,
and their five qualities, the principles spiritual, fiery, dry, humid, and airy."
So five primitive powers, elements, or elementary qualities, are united with the Sun and Moon in the Indian theology, air, spirit, fire, water, and earth: and the same five elements are recognized by the

Chinese.
The Ph�nicians, like the Egyptians, regarded the Sun and Moon and Stars as sole causes of generation and destruction here below. The Moon, like the Sun, changed continually the track in which she crossed
the Heavens, moving ever to and fro between the upper and lower limits of the Zodiac; and her different places, phases, and aspects there, and her relations with the Sun and the constellations, have been a
fruitful source of mythological fables.
All the planets had what astrology termed their houses, in the Zodiac. The House of the Sun was in Leo, and that of the Moon in Cancer. Each other planet had two, signs; Mercury had Gemini and Virgo;
Venus, Taurus and Libra; Mars, Aries and Scorpio; Jupiter, Pisces and Sagittarius; and Saturn, Aquarius and Capricornus. From this distribution of the signs also came many mythological emblems
and fables; as also many came from the places of exaltation of the planets. Diana of Ephesus, the Moon, wore the image of a crab on her bosom, because in that sign was the Moon's domicile; and lions bore
up the throne of Horus, the Egyptian Apollo, the Sun personified, for a like reason: while the Egyptians
consecrated the tauriforn scarab�s to the Moon, because she had her place of exaltation in Taurus; and
for the same reason Mercury is said to have presented Isis with a helmet like a bull's head.
A further division of the Zodiac was of each sign into three parts of 10� each, called Decans, or, in the whole Zodiac, 36 parts, among which the seven planets were apportioned anew, each planet having an
equal number of Decans, except the first, which, opening and closing the series of planets five times repeated, necessarily had one Decan more than the others. This subdivision was not invented until after
Aries opened the Vernal Equinox; and accordingly Mars, having his house in Aries, opens the series of decans and closes it; the planets following each other, five times in succession, in the following order,
Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, etc; so that to each sign are assigned three planets, each occupying 10 degrees. To each Decan a God or Genius was assigned, making thirty
six in all, one of whom, the Chaldeans said, came down upon earth every ten days, remained so many days, and reascended to Heaven.
This division is found on the Indian sphere, the Persian, and that Barbaric one which Aben Ezra
describes. Each genius of the Decans had a name and special characteristics. They concur and aid in the effects produced by the Sun, Moon, and other planets charged with the administration of the world: and
the doctrine in regard to them, secret and august as it was held, was considered of the gravest importance; and its principles, Firmicus says, were not entrusted by the ancients, inspired as they were
by the Deity, to any but the Initiates, and to them only with great reserve, and a kind of fear, and when cautiously enveloped with an obscure veil, that they might not come to be known by the profane.
With these Decans were connected the paranatellons or those stars outside of the Zodiac, that rise and

362/641
set at the same moment with the several divisions of 10� of each sign. As there were anciently only fortyeight celestial figures or constellations, of which twelve were in the Zodiac, it follows that there
were, outside of the Zodiac, thirtysix other asterisms, paranatellons of the several thirtysix Decans. For example, as when Capricorn set, Sirius and Procyon, or Canis Major and Canis Minor, rose, they
were the Paranatellons of Capricorn, though at a great distance from it in the heavens. The rising of Cancer was known from the setting of Corona Borealis and the rising of the Great and Little Dog, its
three paranatellons.
The risings and settings of the Stars are always spoken of as connected with the Sun. In that connection there are three kinds of them, cosmical, achronical, and heliacal, important to be distinguished by all
who would understand this ancient learning.
When any Star rises or sets with the same degree of the same sign of the Zodiac that the Sun occupies at the time, it rises and sets simultaneously with the Sun, and this is termed rising or setting cosmically;
but a star that so rises and sets can never be seen, on account of the light that precedes, and is left behind by the Sun. It is therefore necessary, in order to know his place in the Zodiac, to observe stars
that rise just before or set just after him.
A Star that is in the Fast when night commences, and in the West when it ends, is said to rise and set achronically. A Star so rising or setting was in opposition to the Sun, rising at the end of evening
twilight, and setting at the beginning of morning twilight, and this happened to each Star but once a year, because the Sun moves from West to Fast, with reference to the Stars, one degree a day.
When a Star rises as night ends in the morning, or sets as night commences in the evening, it is said to
rise or set heliacally, because the Sun (Helios) seems to touch it with his luminous atmosphere. A Star thus reappears after a disappearance, often of several months, and thenceforward it rises an hour
earlier each day, gradually emerging from the Sun's rays, until at the end of three months it precedes the Sun six hours, and rises at midnight. A Star sets heliacally, when no longer remaining visible above the
western horizon after sunset, the day arrives when they cease to be seen setting in the West. They so remain invisible, until the Sun passes so far to the Eastward as not to eclipse them with his light; and
then they reappear, but in the East, about an hour and a half before sunrise: and this is their heliacal rising. In this interval, the cosmical rising and setting take place.
Besides the relations of the constellations and their paranatelIons with the houses and places of
exaltation of the Planets, and with their places in the respective Signs and Decans, the Stars were supposed to produce different effects according as they rose or set, and according as they did so either
cosmically, achronicany, or heliacally; and also according to the different seasons of the year in which these phenomena occurred; and these differences were carefully marked on the old Calendars; and

many things in the ancient allegories are referable to them.
Another and most important division of the Stars was into good and bad, beneficent and malevolent. With the Persians, the former, of the Zodiacal Constellations, were from Aries to Virgo, inclusive; and
the latter from Libra to Pisces, inclusive. Hence the good Angels and Genii, and the bad Angels, Devs, Evil Genii, Devils, Fallen Angels, Titans, and Giants of the Mythology. The other thirtysix
Constellations were equally divided, eighteen on each side, or, with those of the Zodiac, twentyfour.
Thus the symbolic Egg, that issued from the mouth of the invisible Egyptian God KNEPH; known in the Grecian Mysteries as the Orphic Egg; from which issued the God CHUMONG of the Coresians,
and the Egyptian OSIRISS, and PHANES, God and Principle of Light; from which, broken by the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, the world emerged; and which the Greeks placed at the feet of BACCHUS
TAURICORNUS; the Magian Egg of ORMUZD, from which came the Amshaspands and Devs; was divided into two halves, and equally apportioned between the Good and Evil Constellations and Angels.
Those of Spring, as for example Aries and Taurus, Auriga and Capella, were the beneficent stars; and those of Autumn, as the Balance, Scorpio, the Serpent of Ophiucus, and the Dragon of the Hesperides,
were types and subjects of the Evil Principle, and regarded as malevolent causes of the ill effects experienced in Autumn and Winter. Thus are explained the mysteries of the journeyings of the human
soul through the spheres, when it descends to the earth by the Sign of the Serpent, and returns to the Empire of light by that of the Lamb or Bull.
The creative action of Heaven was manifested, and all its demiurgic energy developed, most of all at the
Vernal Equinox, to which refer all the fables that typify the victory of Light over Darkness, by the triumphs of Jupiter, Osiris, Ormuzd, and Apollo. Always the triumphant god takes the form of the Bull,
the Ram, or the Lamb. Then Jupiter wrests from Typhon his thunderbolts, of which that malignant Deity had possessed himself during the Winter. Then the God of Light overwhelms his foe, pictured as
a huge Serpent. Then Winter ends; the Sun, seated on the Bull and accompanied by Orion, blazes in the Heavens. All nature rejoices at the victory; and Order and Harmony are everywhere reestablished, in
place of the dire confusion that reigned while gloomy Typhon domineered, and Ahriman prevailed against Ormuzd.
The universal Soul of the World, motive power of Heaven and of the Spheres, it was held, exercises its
creative energy chiefly through the medium of the Sun, during his revolution along the signs of the Zodiac, with which signs unite the paranatellons that modify their influence, and concur in furnishing
the symbolic attributes of the Great Luminary that regulates Nature and is the depository of her greatest powers. The action of this Universal Soul of the World is displayed in the movements of the Spheres,
and above all in that of the Sun, in the successions of the risings and settings of the Stars, and in their periodical returns. By these are explainable all the metamorphoses of that Soul, personified as Jupiter,
as Bacchus, as Vishnu, or as Buddha, and all the various attributes ascribed to it; and also the worship

of those animals that were consecrated in the ancient Temples, representatives on earth of the Celestial Signs, and supposed to receive by transmission from them the rays and emanations which in them flow
from the Universal Soul.
All the old Adorers of Nature, the Theologians, Astrologers, and Poets, as well as the most distinguished Philosophers, supposed that the Stars were so many animated and intelligent beings, or
eternal bodies, active causes of effect here below, animated by a living principle, and directed by an intelligence that was itself but an emanation from and a part of the life and universal intelligence of the
world and we find in the hierarchical order and distribution of their eternal and divine Intelligences, known by the names of Gods, Angels, and Genii, the same distributions and the same divisions as those
by which the ancients divided the visible Universe and distributed its parts. And the famous divisions by seven and by twelve, appertaining to the planets and the signs of the zodiac, is everywhere found in
the hierarchical order of the Gods, and Angels, and the other Ministers that are the depositaries of that Divine Force which moves and rules the world.
These, and the other Intelligences assigned to the other Stars, have absolute dominion over all parts of
Nature; over the elements, the animal and vegetable kingdoms, over man and all his actions, over his virtues and vices, and over good and evil, which divide between them his life. The passions of his soul
and the maladies of his body, these and the entire man are dependent on the heavens and the genii that there inhabit, who preside at his birth, control his fortunes during life, and receive his soul or active and
intelligent part when it is to be reunited to the pure life of the lofty Stars. And all through the great body of the world are disseminated portions of the universal Soul, impressing movement on everything
that seems to move of itself, giving life to the plants and trees, directing by a regular and settled plan the organization and development of their germs, imparting constant mobility to the running waters and
maintaining their eternal motion, impelling the winds and changing their direction or stilling them, calming and arousing the ocean, unchaining the storm pouring out the fires of volcanoes, or with
earthquakes shaking the roots of huge mountains and the foundations of vast continents; by means of a force that, belonging to Nature, is a mystery to man.
And these invisible Intelligences, like the stars, are marshalled in two great divisions, under the banners
of the two Principles of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness; under Ormuzd and Ahriman, Osiris and Typhon. The Evil Principle was the motive power of brute matter; and it, personified as Ahriman and
Typhon, had its hosts and armies of Devs and Genii, Fallen Angels and Malevolent Spirits, who waged continual wage with the Good Principle, the Principle of Empyreal Light and Splendor, Osiris,
Ormuzd, Jupiter or Dionusos, with his bright hosts of Amshaspands, Izeds, Angels, and Archangels; a warfare that goes on from birth until death, in the soul of every man that lives.

facts.
The Sun, at the Vernal Equinox, was the fruitcompelling star that by his warmth provoked generation and poured upon the sublunary world all the blessings of Heaven; the beneficent god, tutelary genius of
universal vegetation, that communicates to the dull earth new activity, and stirs her great heart, long chilled by Winter and his frosts, until from her bosom burst all the greenness and perfume of spring,
making her rejoice in leafy forests and grassy lawns and flowerenamelled meadows, and the promise of abundant crops of grain and fruits and purple grapes in their due season.
He was then called Osiris, Husband of Isis, God of Cultivation and Benefactor of Men, pouring on
them and on the earth the choicest blessings within the gift of the Divinity. Opposed to him was Typhon, his antagonist in the Egyptian mythology, as Ahriman was the foe of Ormuzd, the Good
Principle, in the theology of the Persians.
The first inhabitants of Egypt and Ethiopia, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, saw in the Heavens two first eternal causes of things, or great Divinities, one the Sun, whom they called Osiris, and the other
the Moon, whom they called Isis; and these they considered the causes of all the generations of earth.
This idea, we learn from Eusebius, was the same as that of the Ph�nicians. On these two great
Divinities the administration of the world depended. All sublunary bodies received from them their nourishment and increase, during the annual revolution which they controlled, and the different seasons
into which it was divided.
To Osiris and Isis, it was held, were owing civilization, the discovery of agriculture, laws, arts of all kinds, religious worship, temples, the invention of letters, astronomy, the gymnastic arts, and music;
and thus they were the universal benefactors. Osiris travelled to civilize the countries which he passed through, and communicate to them his valuable discoveries. He built cities, and taught men to cultivate
the earth. Wheat and wine were his first presents to men. Europe, Asia, and Africa partook of the blessings which he communicated, and the most remote regions of India remembered him, and claimed
him as one of their great gods.
You have learned how Typhon, his brother, slew him. His body was cut into pieces, all of which were collected by Isis, except his organs of generation, which had been thrown into and devoured in the
waters of the river that every year fertilized Egypt. The other portions were buried by Isis, and over them she erected a tomb. Thereafter she remained single, loading her subjects with blessings. She cured
the sick, restored sight to the blind, made the paralytic whole, and even raised the dead.
From her Horus or Apollo learned divination and the science of medicine. Thus the Egyptians pictured the beneficent action of the two luminaries that, from the bosom of the elements, produced all animals

and men, and all bodies that are born, grow, and die in the eternal circle of generation and destruction here below.
When the Celestial Bull opened the new year at the Vernal Equinox, Osiris, united with the Moon,
communicated to her the seeds of fruitfulness which she poured upon the air, and therewith impregnated the generative principles which gave activity to universal vegetation. Apis, represented by
a bull, was the living and sensible image of the Sun or Osiris, when in union with Isis or the Moon at the Vernal Equinox, concurring with her in provoking everything that lives to generation. This
conjunction of the Sun with the Moon at the Vernal Equinox, in the constellation Taurus, required the Bull Apis to have on his shoulder a mark resembling the Crescent Moon. And the fecundating influence
of these two luminaries was expressed by images that would now be deemed gross and indecent, but which then were not misunderstood.
Everything good in Nature comes from Osiris, order, harmony, and the favorable temperature of the
seasons and celestial periods. From Typhon come the stormy passions and irregular impulses that agitate the brute and material part of man; maladies of the body, and violent shocks that injure the
health and derange the system; inclement weather, derangement of the seasons, and eclipses. Osiris and Typhon were the Ormuzd and Ahriman of the Persians; principles of good and evil, of light and
darkness, ever at war in the administration of the Universe.
Osiris was the image of generative power. This was expressed by his symbolic statues, and by the sign into which he entered at the Vernal Equinox. He especially dispensed the humid principle of Nature,
generative element of all things; and the Nile and all moisture were regarded as emanations from him, without which there could be no vegetation.
That Osiris and Isis were the Sun and Moon, is attested by many ancient writers; by Diogenes Laertius,
Plutarch, Lucian, Suidas, Macrobius, Martianus Capella, and others. His power was symbolized by an Eye over a Sceptre. The Sun was termed by the Greeks the Eye of Jupiter, and the Eye of the World;
and his is the AllSeeing Eye in our Lodges. The oracle of Claros styled him King of the Stars and of the Eternal Fire, that engenders the year and the seasons, dispenses rain and winds, and brings about
daybreak and night. And Osiris was invoked as the God that resides in the Sun and is enveloped by his rays, the invisible and eternal force that modifies the sublunary world by means of the Sun.
Osiris was the same God known as Bacchus, Dionusos, and Serapis. Serapis is the author of the
regularity and harmony of the world. Bacchus, jointly with Ceres (identified by Herodotus with Isis) presides over the distribution of all our blessings; and from the two emanates everything beautiful and
good in Nature. One furnishes the germ and principle of every good; the other receives and preserves it as a deposit; and the latter is the function of the Moon in the theology of the Persians. In each theology,

Persian and Egyptian, the Moon acts directly on the earth; but she is fecundated, in one by the Celestial Bull and in the other by Osiris, with whom she is united at the Vernal Equinox, in the sign Taurus, the
place of her exaltation or greatest influence on the earth. The force of Osiris, says Plutarch, is exercised through the Moon. She is the passive cause relatively to him, and the active cause relatively to the earth,
to which she transmits the germs of fruitfulness received from him.
In Egypt the earliest movement in the waters of the Nile began to appear at the Vernal Equinox, when the new Moon occurred at the entrance of the Sun into the constellation Taurus; and thus the Nile was
held to receive its fertilizing power from the combined action of the equinoctial Sun and the new Moon, meeting in Taurus. Osiris was often confounded with the Nile, and Isis with the earth; and Osiris was
deemed to act on the earth, and to transmit to it his emanations, through both the Moon and the Nile; whence the fable that his generative organs were thrown into that river. Typhon, on the other hand, was
the principle of aridity and barrenness; and by his mutilation of Osiris was meant that drought which caused the Nile to retire within his bed and shrink up in Autumn.
Elsewhere than in Egypt, Osiris was the symbol of the refreshing rains that descend to fertilize the
earth; and Typhon the burning winds of Autumn; the stormy rains that rot the flowers, the plants, and leaves; the short, cold days; and everything injurious in Nature, and that produces corruption and
destruction.
In short, Typhon is the principle of corruption, of darkness, of the lower world from which come earthquakes, tumultuous commotions of the air, burning heat, lightning, and fiery meteors, and plague
and pestilence.
Such too was the Ahriman of the Persians; and this revolt of the Evil Principle against the Principle of Good and Light, has been represented in every cosmogony, under many varying forms. Osiris, on the
contrary, by the intermediation of Isis, fills the material world with happiness, purity, and order, by which the harmony of Nature is maintained. It was said that he died at the Autumnal Equinox, when
Taurus or the Pleiades rose in the evening, and that he rose to life again in "lie Spring, when vegetation was inspired with new activity.
Of course the two signs of Taurus and Scorpio will figure most largely in the mythological history of
Osiris, for they marked the two equinoxes, 2500 years before our Era; and next to them the other constellations, near the equinoxes, that fixed the limits of the duration of the fertilizing action of the
Sun; and it is also to be remarked that Venus, the Goddess of Generation, has her domicile in Taurus, as the Moon has there her place of exaltation.
When the Sun was in Scorpio, Osiris lost his life, and that fruitfulness which, under the form of the

368/641
Bull, he had communicated, through the Moon, to the Earth. Typhon, his hands and feet horrid with serpents, and whose habitat in the Egyptian planisphere was under Scorpio, confined him in a chest and
flung him into the Nile, under the 17th degree of Scorpio. Under that sign he lost his life and virility; and he recovered them in the Spring, when he had connection with the Moon. When he entered
Scorpio, his light diminished, Night reassumed her dominion, the Nile shrunk within its banks, and the earth lost her verdure and the trees their leaves. Therefore it is that on the Mithriac Monuments, the
Scorpion bites the testicles of the Equinoctial Bull, on which sits Mithras, the Sun of Spring and God of Generation; and that, on the same monuments, we see two trees, one covered with young leaves, and at
its foot a little bull and a torch burning; and the other loaded with fruit, and at its foot a Scorpion, and a torch reversed and extinguished.
Ormuzd or Osiris, the beneficent Principle that gives the world light, was personified by the Sun,
apparent source of light. Darkness, personified by Typhon or Ahriman, was his natural enemy. The Sages of Egypt described the necessary and eternal rivalry or opposition of these principles, ever
pursuing one the other, and one dethroning the other in every annual revolution, and at a particular period, one in the Spring under the Bull, and the other in Autumn under the Scorpion, by the legendary
history of Osiris and Typhon, detailed to us by Diodorus and Synesius; in which history were also personified the Stars and constellations Orion, Capella, the Twins, the Wolf, Sirius, and Hercules,
whose risings and settings noted the advent of one or the other equinox.
Plutarch gives us the positions in the Heavens of the Sun and Moon, at the moment when Osiris was murdered by Typhon. The Sun, he says, was in the Sign of the Scorpion, which he then entered at the
Autumnal Equinox. The Moon was full, he adds; and consequently, as it rose at sunset, it occupied Taurus, which, opposite to Scorpio, rose as it and the Sun sank together, so that she was then found
alone in the sign Taurus, where, six months before, she had been in union or conjunction with Osiris, the Sun, receiving from him those germs of universal fertilization which he communicated to her. It
was the sign through which Osiris first ascended into his empire of light and good. It rose with the Sun on the day of the Vernal Equinox; it remained six months in the luminous hemisphere, ever preceding
the Sun and above the horizon during the day; until in Autumn, the Sun arriving at Scorpio, Taurus was in complete opposition with him, rose when he set, and completed its entire course above the horizon
during the night; presiding, by rising in the evening, over the commencement of the long nights. Hence in the sad ceremonies commemorating the death of Osiris, there was borne in procession a golden bull
covered with black crape, image of the darkness into which the familiar sign of Osiris was entering, and which was to spread over the Northern regions, while the Sun, prolonging the nights, was to be absent,
and each to remain under the dominion of Typhon, Principle of Evil and Darkness.
Setting out from the sign Taurus, Isis, as the Moon, went seeking for Osiris through all the superior signs, in each of which she became full in the successive months from the Autumnal to the Vernal
Equinox, without finding him in either. Let us follow her in her allegorical wanderings.

Osiris was slain by Typhon his rival, with whom conspired a Queen of Ethiopia, by whom, says Plutarch, were designated the winds. The paranatellons of Scorpio, the sign occupied by the Sun when
Osiris was slain, were the Serpents, reptiles which supplied the attributes of the Evil Genii and of Typhon, who himself bore the form of a serpent in the Egyptian planisphere. And in the division of
Scorpio is also found Cassiopeia, Queen of Ethiopia, whose setting brings stormy winds.
Osiris descended to the shades or infernal regions. There he took the name of Serapis, identical with Pluto, and assumed his nature. He was then in conjunction with Serpentarius, identical with
�sculapius, whose form he took in his passage to the lower signs, where he takes the names of Pluto and Ades.
Then Isis wept for the death of Osiris, and the golden bull covered with crape was carried in procession.
Nature mourned the impending loss of her Summer glories, and the advent of the empire of night, the withdrawing of the waters, made fruitful by the Bull in Spring, the cessation of the winds that brought
rains to swell the Nile, the shortening of the days, and the despoiling of the earth. Then Taurus, directly opposite the Sun, entered into the cone of shadow which the earth projects, by which the Moon is
eclipsed at full, and with which, making night, the Bull rises and descends as if covered with a veil, while he remains above our horizon.
The body of Osiris, enclosed in a chest or coffin, was cast into the Nile. Pan and the Satyrs, near
Chemmis, first discovered his death, announced it by their cries, and everywhere created sorrow and alarm. Taurus, with the full Moon, then entered into the cone of shadow, and under him was the
Celestial River, most properly called the Nile, and below, Perseus, the God of Chemmis, and Auriga, leading a shegoat, himself identical with Pan, whose wife Aiga the shegoat was styled.
Then Isis went in search of the body. She first met certain children who had seen it, received from them
their information, and gave them in return the gift of divination. The second full Moon occurred in Gemini, the Twins, who presided over the oracles of Didymus, and one of whom was Apollo, the God
of Divination.
She learned that Osiris had, through mistake, had connection with her sister Nephte, which she discovered by a crown of leaves of the melilot, which he had left behind him. Of this connection a child
was born, whom Isis, aided by her dogs, sought for, found, reared, and attached to herself, by the name of Anubis, her faithful guardian. The third full Moon occurs in Cancer, domicile of the Moon. The
paranatellons of that sign are, the crown of Ariadne or Proserpine, made of leaves of the melilot, Procyon and Canis Major, one star of which was called the Star of Isis, while Sirius himself was
honored in Egypt under the name of Anubis.

Isis repaired to Byblos, and seated herself near a fountain, where she was found by the women of the Court of a King. She was induced to visit his Court, and became the nurse of his son. The fourth full
Moon was in Leo, domicile of the Sun, or of Adonis, King of Byblos. The paranatellons of this sign are the flowing water of Aquarius, and Cephens, King of Ethiopia, called Regulus, or simply The King.
Behind him rise Cassiopeia his wife, Queen of Ethiopia, Andromeda his daughter, and Perseus his son inlaw, all paranatellons in part of this sign, and in part of Virgo. Isis suckled the child, not at her
breast, but with the end of her finger, at night. She burned all the mortal parts of its body, and then, taking the shape of a swallow, she flew to the great column of the palace, made of the tamarisktree that
grew up round the coffin containing the body of Osiris, and within which it was still enclosed. The fifth full Moon occurred in Virgo, the true image of Isis, and which Eratosthenes calls by that name. It
pictured a woman suckling an infant, the son of Isis, born near the Winter Solstice. This sign has for paranatellons the mast of the Celestial Ship, and the swallowtailed fish or swallow above it, and a
portion of Perseus, soninlaw of the King of Ethiopia.
Isis, having recovered the sacred coffer, sailed from Byblos in a vessel with the eldest son of the King, toward Boutos, where Anubis was, having charge of her son Horus; and in the morning dried up a river,
whence arose a strong wind. Landing, she hid the coffer in a forest.
Typhon, hunting a wild boar by moonlight, discovered it, recognized the body of his rival, and cut it into fourteen pieces, the number of days between the full and new Moon, and in every one of which
days the Moon loses a portion of the light that at the commencement filled her whole disk. The sixth full Moon occurred in Libra over the divisions separating which from Virgo are the Celestial Ship,
Perseus, son of the King of Ethiopia and Bo�tes, said to have nursed Horus. The river of Orion that sets in the morning is also a paranatellon of Libra, as are Ursa Major, the Great Bear or Wild Boar of
Erymanthus, and the Dragon of the North Pole or the celebrated Python from which the attributes of Typhon were borrowed. All these surround the full Moon of Libra, last of the Superior Signs, and the
one that precedes the new Moon of Spring, about to be reproduced in Taurus, and there be once more in conjunction with the Sun.
Isis collects the scattered fragments of the body of Osiris, buries them, and consecrates the phallus,
carried in pomp at the Pamylia, or feasts of the Vernal Equinox, at which time the congress of Osiris and the Moon was celebrated. Then Osiris had returned from the shades, to aid Horus his son and Isis
his wife against the forces of Typhon. He thus reappeared, say some, under the form of a wolf, or, others say, under that of a horse. The Moon, fourteen days after she is full in Libra, arrives at Taurus
and unites herself to the Sun, whose fires she thereafter for fourteen days continues to accumulate on her disk from new Moon to full. Then she unites with herself all the months in that superior portion of
the world where light always reigns, with harmony and order, and she borrows from him the force which is to destroy the germs of evil that Typhon had, during the winter, planted everywhere in nature.
This passage of the Sun into Taurus, whose attributes he assumes on his return from the lower hemisphere or the shades, is marked by the rising in the evening of the Wolf and the Centaur, and by

the heliacal setting of Orion, called the Star of Horus, and which thenceforward is in conjunction with the Sun of Spring, in his triumph over the darkness or Typhon.
Isis, during the absence of Osiris, and after she had hidden the coffer in the place where Typhon found
it, had rejoined that malignant enemy; indignant at which, Horus her son deprived her of her ancient diadem when she rejoined Osiris as lie was about to attack Typhon but Mercury gave her in its place a
helmet shaped like the head of a bull.
Then Horus, as a mighty warrior, such as Orion was described, fought with and defeated Typhon; who, in the shape of the Serpent or Dragon of the Pole, had assailed his father. So, in Ovid, Apollo destroys
the same Python, when Io, fascinated by Jupiter, is metamorphosed into a cow, and placed in the sign of the Celestial Bull, where she becomes Isis. The equinoctial year ends at the moment when the Sun and
Moon, at the Vernal Equinox, are united with Orion, the Star of Horns, placed of in theHeavens under Taurus. The new Moon becomes young again in Taurus, and shows herself as a crescent, for the first
time, in the next sign, Gemini, the domicile of Mercury. Then Orion, in conjunction with the Sun, with whom he rises, precipitates the Scorpion, his rival, into the shades of night, causing him to set he
whenever he himself reappears on the eastern horizon, with the Sun. Day lengthens and the germs of evil are by degrees eradicated and Horus (from Aur, Light) reigns triumphant, symbolizing, by his
succession to the characteristics of Osiris, the eternal renewal of the Sun's youth and creative vigor at the Vernal of Equinox.
XXVI. PRINCE OF MERCY OR SCOTTISH TRINITARIAN
WHILE you were veiled in darkness, you heard repeated by the Voice of the Great Past its most ancient doctrines. None has the right to object, if the Christian Mason sees foreshadowed in Chrishna and
Sosiosch, in Mithras and Osiris, the Divine WORD that, as he believes, became Man, and died upon the cross to redeem a fallen race. Nor can he object if others see reproduced, in the WORD of the beloved
Disciple, that was in the beginning with God, and that was God, and by Whom everything was made, only the LOGOS of Plato, and the WORD or Uttered THOUGHT or first Emanation of LIGHT, or the
Perfect REASON of the Great, Silent, Supreme, Uncreated Deity, believed in and adored by all.
We do not undervalue the importance of any Truth. We utter no word that can be deemed irreverent by any one of any faith. We do not tell the Moslem that it is only important for him to believe that there is
but one God, and wholly unessential whether Mahomet was His prophet. We do not tell the Hebrew that the Messiah whom he expects was born in Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago; and that he is
a heretic because he will not so believe. And as little do we tell the sincere Christian that Jesus of Nazareth was but a man like us, or His history but the unreal revival of an older legend. To do either is

beyond our jurisdiction. Masonry, of no one age, belongs to all time; of no one religion, it finds its great truths in all.
To every Mason, there is a GOD; ONE, Supreme, Infinite in Goodness, Wisdom, Foresight, justice, and
Benevolence; Creator, Disposer, and Preserver of all things. How, or by what intermediates He creates and acts, and in what way He unfolds and manifests Himself, Masonry leaves to creeds and Religions to
inquire.
To every Mason, the soul of man is immortal. Whether it emanates from and will return to God, and what its continued mode of existence hereafter, each judges for himself. Masonry was not made to settle
that.
To every Mason, WISDOM or INTELLIGENCE, FORCE or STRENGTH, and HARMONY, or FITNESS and BEAUTY, are the Trinity of the attributes of God. With the subtleties of Philosophy
concerning them Masonry does not meddle, nor decide as to the reality of the supposed Existences which are their Personifications: nor whether the Christian Trinity be such a personification, or a
Reality of the gravest import and significance.
To every Mason, the Infinite justice and Benevolence of God give ample assurance that Evil will ultimately be dethroned, and the Good, the True, and the Beautiful reign triumphant and eternal. It
teaches, as it feels and knows, that Evil, and Pain, and Sorrow exist as part of a wise and beneficent plan, all the parts of which work together under God's eye to a result which shall be perfection. Whether
the existence of evil is rightly explained in this creed or in that, by Typhon the Great Serpent, by Ahriman and his Armies of Wicked Spirits, by the Giants and Titans that war against Heaven, by the
two coexistent Principles of Good and Evil, by Satan's temptation and the fall of Man, by Lok and the Serpent Fenris, it is beyond the domain of Masonry to decide, nor does it need to inquire.
Nor is it within its Province to determine how the ultimate triumph of Light and Truth and Good, over
Darkness and Error and Evil, is to be achieved; nor whether the Redeemer, looked and longed for by all nations, hath appeared in Judea, or is yet to come.
It reverences all the great reformers. It sees in Moses, the Lawgiver of the Jews, in Confucius and
Zoroaster, in Jesus of Nazareth, and in the Arabian Iconoclast, Great Teachers of Morality, and Eminent Reformers, if no more: and allows every brother of the Order to assign to each such higher and even
Divine Character as his Creed and Truth require.
Thus Masonry disbelieves no truth, and teaches unbelief in no creed, except so far as such creed may

lower its lofty estimate of the Deity, degrade Him to the level of the passions of humanity, deny the high destiny of man, impugn the goodness and benevolence of the Supreme God, strike at those great
columns of Masonry, Faith, Hope, and Charity, or inculcate immorality, and disregard of the active duties of the Order.
Masonry is a worship; but one in which all civilized men can unite; for it does not undertake to explain
or dogmatically to settle those great mysteries, that are above the feeble comprehension of our human intellect. It trusts in God, and HOPES; it BELIEVES, like a child, and is humble. It draws no sword to
compel others to adopt its belief, or to be happy with its hopes. Arid it WAITS with patience to understand the mysteries of Nature and Nature's God hereafter.
The greatest mysteries in the Universe are those which are ever going on around us; so trite and
common to us that we never note them nor reflect upon them. Wise men tell us of the laws that regulate the motions of the spheres, which, flashing in huge circles and spinning on their axes, are also ever
darting with inconceivable rapidity through the infinities of Space; while we atoms sit here, and dream that all was made for us. They tell us learnedly of centripetal and centrifugal forces, gravity and
attraction, and all the other sounding terms invented to hide a want of meaning. There are other forces in the Universe than those that are mechanical.
Here are two minute seeds, not much unlike in appearance, and two of larger size. Hand them to the
learned Pundit, Chemistry, who tells us how combustion goes on in the lungs, and plants are fed with phosphorus and carbon, and the alkalies and silex. Let her decompose them, analyze them, torture them
in all the ways she knows. The net result of each is a little sugar, a little fibrin, a little water carbon, potassium, sodium, and the like one cares not to know what.
We hide them in the ground and the slight rains moisten them, and the Sun shines upon them, and little
slender shoots spring up and grow; and what a miracle is the mere growth! The force, the power, the capacity by which the little feeble shoot, that a small worm can nip off with a single snap of its
mandibles, extracts from the earth and air and water the different elements, so learnedly catalogued, with which it increases in stature, and rises imperceptibly toward the sky.
One grows to be a slender, fragile, feeble stalk, soft of texture, like an ordinary weed; another a strong
bush, of woody fibre, armed with thorns, and sturdy enough to bid defiance to the winds : the third a tender tree, subject to be blighted by the frost, and looked down upon by all the forest; while another
spreads its rugged arms abroad, and cares for neither frost nor ice, nor the snows that for months lie around its roots.
But lo! out of the brown foul earth, and colorless invisible air, and limpid rainwater, the chemistry of

the seeds has extracted colors four different shades of green, that paint the leaves which put forth in the spring upon our plants, our shrubs, and our trees. Later still come the flowers the vivid colors of the
rose, the beautiful brilliance of the carnation, the modest blush of the apple, and the splendid white of the orange. Whence come the colors of the leaves and flowers? By what process of chemistry are they
extracted from the carbon, the phosphorus, and the lime? Is it any greater miracle to make something out of nothing?
Pluck the flowers. Inhale the delicious perfumes; each perfect, and all delicious. Whence have they
come? By what combination of acids and alkalies could the chemist's laboratory produce them? And now on two comes the fruit the ruddy apple and the golden orange.
Pluck them, open them! The texture and fabric how totally different! The taste how entirely dissimilar,
the perfume of each distinct from its flower and from the other. Whence the taste and this new perfume? The same earth and air and water have been made to furnish a different taste to each fruit, a
different perfume not only to each fruit, but to each fruit and its own
flower.
Is it any more a problem whence come thought and will and perception and all the phenomena of the
mind, than this, whence come the colors, the perfumes, the taste, of the fruit and flower?
And lo! in each fruit new seeds, each gifted with the same wondrous power of reproduction each with the same wondrous forces wrapped up in it to be again in turn evolved. Forces that had lived three
thousand years in the grain of wheat found in the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy; forces of which learning and science and wisdom know no more than they do of the nature and laws of action of God.
What can we know of the nature, and how can we understand the powers and mode of operation of the human soul, when the glossy leaves, the pearlwhite flower, and the golden fruit of the orange are
miracles wholly beyond our comprehension?
We but hide our ignorance in a cloud of words; and the words too often are mere combinations of sounds without any meaning. What is the centrifugal force? A tendency to go in a particular direction!
What external "force," then, produces that tendency?
What force draws the needle round to the north? What force moves the muscle that raises the arm, when the will determines it shall rise? Whence comes the will itself? Is it spontaneous a first cause, or an
effect? These too are miracles; inexplicable as the creation, or the existence and selfexistence of God.

Who will explain to us the passion, the peevishness, the anger, the memory, and affections of the small canarywren? the consciousness of identity and the dreams of the dog? the reasoning powers of the
elephant? the wondrous instincts, passions, government, and civil policy, and modes of communication of ideas of the ant and bee?
Who has yet made us to understand, with all his learned words, how heat comes to us from the Sun, and
light from the remote Stars, setting out upon its journey earthward from some, at the time the Chaldeans commenced to build the Tower of Babel? Or how the image of an external object comes to
and fixes itself upon the retina of the eye; and when there, how that mere empty, unsubstantial image becomes transmuted into the wondrous thing that we call SIGHT? Or how the waves of the atmosphere
striking upon the tympanum of the ear those thin, invisible waves produce the equally wondrous phenomenon of HEARING, and become the roar of the tornado, the crash of the thunder, the mighty
voice of the ocean, the chirping of the cricket, the delicate sweet notes and exquisite trills and variations of the wren and mockingbird, or the magic melody of the instrument of Paganini?
Our senses are mysteries to us, and we are mysteries to ourselves. Philosophy has taught us nothing as
to the nature of our sensations, our perceptions, our cognizances, the origin of our thoughts and ideas, but words. By no effort or degree of reflection, never so long continued, can man become conscious of
a personal identity in himself, separate and distinct from his body and his brain.
We torture ourselves in the effort to gain an idea of ourselves, and weary with the exertion. Who has yet made us understand how, from the contact with a foreign body, the image in the eye, the wave of air
impinging on the ear, particular particles entering the nostrils, and coming in contact with the palate, come sensations in the nerves, and from that, perception in the mind, of the animal or the man?
What do we know of Substance? Men even doubt yet whether it exists. Philosophers tell us that our
senses make known to us only the attributes of substance, extension, hardness, color, and the like; but not the thing itself that is extended, solid, black or white; as we know the attributes of the Soul, its
thoughts and its perceptions, and not the Soul itself which perceives and thinks.
What a wondrous mystery is there in heat and light, existing, we know not how, within certain limits, narrow in comparison with infinity, beyond which on every side stretch out infinite space and the
blackness of unimaginable darkness, and the intensity of inconceivable cold! Think only of the mighty Power required to maintain warmth and light in the central point of such an infinity, to whose darkness
that of Midnight, to whose cold that of the last Arctic Island is nothing. And yet GOD is everywhere.
And what a mystery are the effects of heat and cold upon the wondrous fluid that we call water! What a mystery lies hidden in every flake of snow and in every crystal of ice, and in their final transformation

into the invisible vapor that rises from the ocean or the land, and floats above the summits of the mountains! What a multitude of wonders, indeed, has chemistry unveiled to our eyes! Think only that if
some single law enacted by God were at once repealed, that of attraction or affinity or cohesion, for example, the whole material world, with its solid granite and adamant, its veins of gold and silver, its
trap and porphyry, its huge beds of coal, our own frames and the very ribs and bones of this apparently indestructible earth, would instantaneously dissolve, with all Suns and Stars and Worlds throughout all
the Universe of God, into a thin invisible vapor of infinitely minute particles or atoms, diffused throughout infinite space; and with them light and heat would disappear; unless the Deity Himself be,
as the Ancient Persians thought, the Eternal Light and the Immortal Fire.
The mysteries of the Great Universe of God! How can we with our limited mental vision expect to grasp and comprehend them! Infinite SPACE, stretching out from us every way, without limit: infinite
TIME, without beginning or end; and WE, HERE, and NOW, in the centre of each! An infinity of suns, the nearest of which only diminish in size, viewed with the most powerful telescope each with its
retinue of worlds; infinite numbers of such suns, so remote from us that their light would not reach us, journeying during an infinity of time, while the light that has reached us, from some that we seem to
see, has been upon its journey for fifty centuries; our world spinning upon its axis, and rushing ever in its circuit round the sun; and it, the sun, and all our system revolving round some great central point;
and that, and suns, stars, and worlds evermore flashing onward with incredible rapidity through illimitable space and then, in every drop of water that we drink, in every morsel of much of our food, in
the air, in the earth, in the sea, incredible multitudes of living creatures, invisible to the naked eye, of a minuteness beyond belief, yet organized, living, feeding, perhaps with consciousness of identity, and
memory and instinct.
Such are some of the mysteries of the great Universe of God. And yet we, whose life and that of the
world on which we live form but a point in the centre of infinite Time: we, who nourish animalcul�
within, and on whom vegetables grow without, would fain learn how God created this Universe, would understand His Powers, His Attributes, His Emanations, His Mode of Existence and of Action; would
fain know the plan according to which all events proceed, that plan profound as God Himself; would know the laws by which He controls His Universe; would fain see and talk to Him face to face, as man
talks to man: and we try not to believe, because we do not understand.
He commands us to love one another, to love our neighbor as ourself; and we dispute and wrangle, and hate and slay each other, because we cannot be of one opinion as to the Essence of His Nature, as to His
Attributes; whether He became man born of a woman, and was crucified; whether the Holy Ghost is of the same substance with the Father, or only of a similar substance; whether a feeble old man is God's
Vicegerent; whether some are elected from all eternity to be saved, and others to be condemned and punished; whether punishment of the wicked after death is to be eternal; whether this doctrine or the
other be heresy or truth; drenching the world with blood, depopulating realms, and turning fertile lands into deserts; until, for religious war, persecution, and bloodshed, the Earth for many a century has rolled

round the Sun, a charnelhouse, steaming and reeking with human gore, the blood of brother slain by brother for opinion's sake, that has soaked into and polluted all her veins, and made her a horror to her
sisters of the Universe.
And if men were all Masons, and obeyed with all their heart her mild and gentle, teachings, that world would be a paradise; while intolerance and persecution make of it a hell. For this is the Masonic Creed:
BELIEVE, in God's Infinite Benevolence, Wisdom, and Justice: HOPE, for the final triumph of Good over Evil, and for Perfect Harmony as the final result of all the concords and discords of the Universe:
and be CHARITABLE as God is, toward the unfaith, the errors, the follies, and the faults of men: for all make one great brotherhood.

Sen.�. W.�. Brother Junior Warden, are you a Prince of Mercy?
Jun.�. W.�. I have seen the Delta and the Holy NAMES upon it, and am an
AMETH like yourself, in the TRIPLE COVENANT, Of which we bear the mark.
Qu.�. What is the first Word upon the Delta?
Ans.�. The Ineffable Name of Deity, the true mystery of which is known to the Ameth alone.
Qu.�. What do the three sides of the Delta denote to us?
Ans.�. To us, and to all Masons, the three Great Attributes or Developments of the Essence of the
Deity; WISDOM, or the Reflective and Designing Power, in which, when there was naught but God, the Plan and Idea of the Universe was shaped and Formed: FORCE, or the Executing and Creating
Power, which instantaneously acting, realized the Type and Idea framed by Wisdom; and the Universe, and all Stars and Worlds, and Light and Life, and Men and Angels and all living creatures WERE; and
HARMONY, or the Preserving Power, Order, and Beauty, maintaining the Universe in its State, and constituting the law of Harmony, Motion, Proportion, and Progression: WISDOM, which thought the
plan; STRENGTH, which created: HARMONY, which upholds and preserves; the Masonic Trinity, three Powers and one Essence: the three columns which support the Universe, Physical, Intellectual,
and Spiritual, of which every Masonic Lodge is a type and symbol: while to the Christian Mason, they represent the Three that bear record in Heaven, the FATHER WORD, and the HOLY SPIRIT, which
three are ONE.
Qu.�. What do the three Greek letters upon the Delta, I.�.H.�. .�. [Iota, Eta, and Sigma] represent?
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



378/641
Ans.�. Three of the Names of the Supreme Deity among the Syrians. Ph�nicians and Hebrews IHUH [ ] SelfExistence AL the NatureGod, or Soul of the Universe SHADAI Supreme Power. Also three of
the Six Chief Attributes of God, among the Kabbalists: WISDOM [IEH], the Intellect, of the Egyptians, the Word of the Platonists, and the Wisdom of the Gnostics; MAGNIFICENCE [AL], the
Symbol of which was the Lion's Head; and VICTORY and GLORY [Tsabaoth], which are the two columns JACHIN and BOAZ, that stand in the Portico of the Temple of Masonry.
To the Christian Mason they are the first three letters of the name of the Son of God, Who died upon
the cross to redeem mankind.
Qu.�. What is the first of the THREE COVENANTS, of which we bear the mark?
Ans.�. That which God made with Noah; when He said, "I will not again curse the earth any more for man's sake, neither will I smite any more everything living as I have done. While the Earth remaineth,
seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and Winter and Summer, and day and night shall not cease. I will establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you, and with every living creature. All
mankind shall no more be cut off by the waters of a flood, nor shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. This is the token of My covenant: I do set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a
token of a covenant between Me and the earth an everlasting covenant between Me and every living creature on the earth."
Qu.�. What is the second of the Three Covenants?
Ans.�. That which God made with Abraham; when He said, "I am the Absolute Uncreated God. I will make My covenant between Me and thee, and thou shalt be the Father of Many Nations, and Kings
shall come from thy loins. I will establish My covenant between Me and thee, and thy descendants after thee, to the remotest generations, for an everlasting covenant; and I will be thy God and their God, and
will give thee the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession."
Qu.�. What is the third Covenant?
Ans.�. That which God made with all men by His prophets; when He said: "I will gather all nations
and tongues, and they shall come and see My Glory. I will create new Heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. The Sun shall no more shine by day, nor the
Moon by night; but the Lord shall be an everlasting light and splendor, His Spirit and His Word shall remain with men forever. The heavens shall vanish away like vapor, and the earth shall wax old like a
garment, and they that dwell therein shall die; but my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not end; and there shall be Light among the Gentiles, and salvation unto the ends of the earth. The
redeemed of the Lord shall return, and everlasting joy be on their heads, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away."
Qu.�. What is the symbol of the Triple Covenant?
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



379/641
Ans.�. The Triple Triangle.
Qu.�. Of what else is it the symbol to us?
Ans.�. Of the Trinity of Attributes of the Deity; and of the triple essence of Man, the Principle of Life,
the Intellectual Power, and the Soul or Immortal Emanation from the Deity.
Qu.�. What is the first great Truth of the Sacred Mysteries?
Ans.�. No man hath seen God at any time. He is One, Eternal, AllPowerful, AllWise, Infinitely just,
Merciful, Benevolent, and Compassionate, Creator and Preserver of all things, the Source of Light and Life, coextensive with Time and Space; Who thought, and with the Thought created the Universe and
all living things, and the souls of men: THAT IS: the PERMANENT; while everything beside is a perpetual genesis.
Qu.�. '"That is the second great Truth of the Sacred Mysteries?
Ans.�. The Soul of Man is Immortal; not the result of organization, nor an aggregate of modes of action of matter, nor a succession of phenomena and perceptions; but an EXISTENCE, one and
identical, a living spirit, a spark of the Great Central Light, that hath entered info and dwells in the body; to be separated therefrom at death, and return to God who gave it that doth not disperse nor
vanish at death, like breath or a smoke, nor can be annihilated; but still exists and possesses activity and intelligence, even as it existed in God, before it was enveloped in the body.
Qu.�. What is the third great Truth in Masonry?
Ans.�. The impulse which directs to right conduct, and deters from crime, is not only older than the ages of nations and cities, but coeval with that Divine Being Who sees and rules both Heaven and earth.
Nor did Tarquin less violate that Eternal Law, though in his reign there might have been no written law at Rome against such violence; for the principle that impels us to right conduct, and warns us against
guilt, springs out of the nature of things. It did not begin to be law when it was first written, nor was it originated; but it is coeval with the Divine Intelligence itself. The consequence of virtue is not to be
made the end thereof; and laudable performances must have deeper roots, motives, and instigations, to give them the stamp of virtues.
Qu.�. What is the fourth great Truth in Masonry?
Ans.�. The moral truths are as absolute as the metaphysical truths. Even the Deity cannot make it that there should be effects without a cause, or phenomena without substance. As little could he make it to
be sinful and evil to respect our pledged word, to love truth, to moderate our passions. The principles of Morality are axioms, like the principles of Geometry. The moral laws are the necessary relations that

380/641
flow from the nature of things, and they are not created by, but have existed eternally in God. Their continued existence does not depend upon the exercise of His WILL.
Truth and Justice are of His ESSENCE. Not because we are feeble and God omnipotent, is it our duty
to obey His law. We may be forced, but are not under obligation, to obey the stronger. God is the principle of Morality, but not by His mere will, which, abstracted from all other of His attributes, would
be neither just nor unjust. Good is the expression of His will, in so far as that will is itself the expression of eternal, absolute, uncreated justice, which is in God, which His will did not create; but
which it executes and promulgates, as our will proclaims and promulgates and executes the idea of the good which is in us. He has given us the law of Truth and justice; but He has not arbitrarily instituted
that law. justice is inherent in His will, because it is contained in His intelligence and wisdom, in His very nature and most intimate essence.
Qu.�. What is the fifth great Truth in Masonry?
Ans.�. There is an essential distinction between Good and Evil, what is just and what is unjust; and to this distinction is attached, for every intelligent and free creature, the absolute obligation of conforming
to what is good and just. Man is an intelligent and free being, free, because he is conscious that it is his duty, and because it is made his duty, to obey the dictates of truth and justice, and therefore he must
necessarily have the power of doing so, which involves the power of not doing so; capable of comprehending the distinction between good and evil, justice and injustice, and the obligation which
accompanies it, and of naturally adhering to that obligation, independently of any contract or positive law; capable also of resisting the temptations which urge him toward evil and injustice, and of
complying with the sacred law of eternal justice.
That man is not governed by a resistless Fate or inexorable Destiny; but is free to choose between the evil and the good: that justice and Right, the Good and Beautiful, are of the essence of the Divinity, like
His Infinitude; and therefore they are laws to man that we are conscious of our freedom to act, as we are conscious of our identity, and the continuance and connectedness of our existence; and have the same
evidence of one as of the other; and if we can put one in doubt, we have no certainty of either, and everything is unreal: that we can deny our free will and free agency, only upon the ground that they are
in the nature of things impossible; which would be to deny the Omnipotence of God.
Qu.�. What is the sixth great Truth of Masonry?
Ans.�. The necessity of practising the moral truths, is obligation. The moral truths, necessary in the
eye of reason, are obligatory on the will. The moral obligation, like the moral truth that is its foundation, is absolute. As the necessary truths are not more or less necessary, so the obligation is not
more or less obligatory. There are degrees of importance among different obligations; but none in the obligation itself. We are not nearly obliged, almost obliged. We are wholly so, or not at all. If there be

381/641
any place of refuge to which we can escape from the obligation, it ceases to exist. If the obligation is absolute, it is immutable and universal. For if that of today may not be that of tomorrow, if what is
obligatory on me may not be obligatory on you, the obligation would differ from itself, and be variable and contingent. This fact is the principle of all morality. That every act contrary to right and justice,
deserves to be repressed by force, and punished when committed, equally in the absence of any law or contract: that man naturally recognizes the distinction between the merit and demerit of actions, as he
does that between justice and injustice, honesty and dishonesty; and feels, without being taught, and in the absence of law or contract, that it is wrong for vice to be rewarded or go unpunished, and for virtue
to be punished or left unrewarded: and that, the Deity being infinitely just and good, it must follow as a necessary and inflexible law that punishment shall be the result of Sin, its inevitable and natural effect
and corollary, and not a mere arbitrary vengeance.
Qu.�. What is the seventh great Truth in Masonry?
Ans.�. The immutable law of God requires, that besides respecting the absolute rights of others, and
being merely just, we should do good, be charitable, and obey the dictates of the generous and noble sentiments of the soul. Charity is a law, because our conscience is not satisfied nor at ease if we have
not relieved the suffering, the distressed, and the destitute. It is to give that which he to whom you give has no right to take or demand. To be charitable is obligatory on us. We are the Almoners of God's
bounties. But the obligation is not so precise and inflexible as the obligation to be just. Charity knows neither rule nor limit. It goes beyond all obligation. Its beauty consists in its liberty. "He that loveth not,
knoweth not God; FOR GOD IS LOVE. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him." To be
kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; to relieve the necessities of the needy, and be generous, liberal, and hospitable; to return to no man evil for evil; to rejoice at the good fortune of
others, and sympathize with them in their sorrows and reverses; to live peaceably with all men, and repay injuries with benefits and kindness; these are the sublime dictates of the Moral Law, taught from
the infancy of the world, by Masonry.
Qu.�. What is the eighth great Truth in Masonry?
Ans.�. That the law which control and regulate the Universe of God, are those of motion and harmony.
We see only the isolated, incidents of things, and with our feeble and limited capacity and, vision cannot discern their connection, nor the mighty chords, that make the apparent discord perfect
harmony. Evil is merely apparent, and all is in reality good and perfect. For pain and sorrow, persecution and hardships, affliction and destitution, sickness and death are but the means, by which
alone the noblest, virtues could be developed. Without them, and without sin and error, and wrong and outrage, as there can be no effect without an adequate cause, there could be neither patience under
suffering and distress; nor prudence in difficulty; nor temperance to avoid excess; nor courage to meet danger; nor truth, when to speak the truth is hazardous; nor love, when it is met with ingratitude; nor
charity for the needy and destitute; nor forbearance and forgiveness of injuries; nor toleration of erroneous opinions; nor charitable judgment and construction of men's motives and actions; nor

382/641
patriotism, nor heroism, nor honor, nor selfdenial, nor generosity. These and most other virtues and excellencies would have no existence, and even their names be unknown; and the poor virtues that still
existed, would scarce deserve the name; for life would be one flat, dead, low level, above which none of the lofty elements of human nature would emerge; and man would lie lapped in contented indolence
and idleness, a mere worthless negative, instead of the brave, strong soldier against the grim legions of Evil and rude Difficulty.
Qu.�. What is the ninth great Truth in Masonry?
Ans.�. The great leading doctrine of this Degree; that the JUSTICE, the WISDOM, and the MERCY of God are alike infinite, alike perfect, and yet do not in the least jar nor conflict one with the other; but
form a Great Perfect Trinity of Attributes, three and yet one that, the principle of merit and demerit being absolute, and every good action deserving to be rewarded, and every bad one to be punished, and
God being as just as He is good; and yet the cases constantly recurring in this world, in which crime and cruelty, oppression, tyranny, and injustice are prosperous, happy, fortunate, and selfcontented, and
rule and reign, and enjoy all the blessings of God's beneficence, while the virtuous and good are unfortunate, miserable, destitute, pining away in dungeons, perishing with cold, and famishing with
hunger, slaves of oppression, and instruments and victims of the miscreants that govern; so that this world, if there were no existence beyond it, would be one great theatre of wrong and injustice, proving
God wholly disregardful of His own necessary law of merit and demerit; it follows that there must be another life in which these apparent wrongs shall be repaired: That all the powers of man's soul tend to
infinity; and his indomitable instinct of immortality, and the universal hope of another life, testified by all creeds, all poetry, all traditions, establish its certainty; for man is not an orphan; but hath a Father
near at hand: and the day must come when Light and Truth, and the just and Good shall be victorious, and Darkness, Error, Wrong, and Evil be annihilated, and known no more forever: That the Universe is
one great Harmony, in which, according to the faith of all nations, deeprooted in all hearts in the primitive ages, Light will ultimately prevail over Darkness, and the Good Principle over the Evil: and
the myriad souls that have emanated from the Divinity, purified and ennobled by the struggle here below, will again return to perfect bliss in the bosom of God, to offend against Whose laws will then be
no longer possible.
Qu.�. What, then, is the one great lesson taught to us, as Masons, in this Degree?
Ans.�. That to that state and realm of Light and Truth and Perfection, which is absolutely certain, all
the good men on earth are tending; and if there is a law from whose operation none are exempt, which inevitably conveys their bodies to darkness and to dust, there is another not less certain nor less
powerful, which conducts their spirits to that state of Happiness and Splendor and Perfection, the bosom of their Father and their God. The wheels of Nature are not made to roll backward. Everything
presses on to Eternity. From the birth of Time an impetuous current has set in, which bears all the sons of men toward that interminable ocean. Meanwhile, Heaven is attracting to itself whatever is cogenial to
its nature, is enriching itself by the spoils of the Earth, and collecting within its capacious bosom whatever is pure, permanent, and divine, leaving nothing for the last fire to consume but the gross

383/641
matter that creates concupiscence; while everything fit for that good fortune shall be gathered and selected from the ruins of the world, to adorn that Eternal City.
Let every Mason then obey the voice that calls him thither. Let us seek the things that are above, and be
not content with a world that must shortly perish, and which we must speedily quit, while we neglect to prepare for that in which we are invited to dwell forever. While everything within us and around us
reminds us of the approach of death, and concurs to teach us that this is., not our rest, let us hasten our preparations for another world, and earnestly implore that help and strength from our Father, which
alone can put an end to that fatal war which our desires have too long waged with our destiny. When these move in the same, direction, and that which God's will renders unavoidable shall become our
choice, all things will be ours; life will be divested of its vanity, and death disarmed of its terrors.
Qu.�. What are the symbols of the purification necessary to make us perfect Masons?
Ans.�. Lavation with pure water, or baptism; because to cleanse the body is emblematical of purifying
the soul; and because it conduces to the bodily health, and virtue is the health of the soul, as sin and vice are its malady and sickness: unction, or anointing with oil; because thereby we are set apart and
dedicated to the service and priesthood of the Beautiful, the True, and the Good: and robes of white, emblems of candor, purity, and truth.
Qu.�. What is to us the chief symbol of man's ultimate redemption and regeneration?
Ans.�. The fraternal supper, of bread which nourishes, and of wine which refreshes and exhilarates, symbolical of the time which is to come, when all mankind shall be one great harmonious brotherhood;
and teaching us these great lessons: that as matter changes ever, but no single atom is annihilated, it is not rational to suppose that the far nobler soul does not continue to exist beyond the grave: that many
thousands who have died before us might claim to be joint owners with ourselves of the particles that compose our mortal bodies; for matter ever forms new combinations; and the bodies of the ancient
dead, the patriarchs before and since the flood, the kings and common people of all ages, resolved into their constituent elements, are carried upon the wind over all continents, and continually enter into and
form part of the habitations of new souls, creating new bonds of sympathy and brotherhood between each man that lives and all his race. And thus, in the bread we eat, and in the wine we drink tonight may
enter into and form part of us the identical particles of matter that once formed parts of the material bodies called Moses, Confucius, Plato, Socrates, or Jesus of Nazareth. In the truest sense, we eat and
drink the bodies of the dead; and cannot say that there is a single atom of our blood or body, the ownership of which some other soul might not dispute with us. It teaches us also the infinite
beneficence of God who sends us seedtime and harvest each in its season, and makes His showers to fall and His sun to shine alike upon the evil and the good bestowing upon us unsolicited His
innumerable blessings, and asking no return. For there are no angels stationed upon the watchtowers of creation to call the world to prayer and sacrifice; but He bestows His benefits in silence, like a kind
friend who comes at night, and, leaving his gifts at the door, to be found by us in the morning, goes
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



384/641
quietly away and asks no thanks, nor ceases his kind offices for our ingratitude. And thus the bread and wine teach us that our Mortal Body is no more WE than the house in which we live, or the garments
that we wear; but the Soul is I, the ONE, identical, unchangeable, immortal emanation from the Diety, to return to God and be forever happy, in His good time; as our mortal bodies, dissolving, return to the
elements from which they came, their particles coining and going ever in perpetual genesis. To our Jewish Brethren, this supper is symbolical of the Passover: to the Christian Mason, of that eaten by
Christ and His Disciples, when, celebrating the Passover, He broke bread and gave it to them, saying, "Take! eat! this is My body:" and giving them the cup, He said, "Drink ye all of it! for this is My blood
of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins;" thus symbolizing the perfect harmony and union between Himself and the faithful; and His death upon the cross for the salvation of
man.
The history of Masonry is the history of Philosophy. Masons do not pretend to set themselves up for instructors of the human race but, though Asia produced and preserved the Mysteries, Masonry has, in
Europe and America, given regularity to their doctrines, spirit, and action, and developed the moral advantages which mankind may reap from them.
More consistent, and more simple in its mode of procedure, it has put an end to the vast allegorical
pantheon of ancient mythologies, and itself become a science.
None can deny that Christ taught a lofty morality. "Love one another forgive those that despitefully use you and persecute you: be pure of heart, meek, humble, contented: lay not up riches on earth, but in
Heaven submit to the powers lawfully over you become like these little children, or ye cannot be saved, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven forgive the repentant; and cast no stone at the sinner, if you too
have sinned: do unto others as ye would have others do unto you:" such, and not abstruse questions of theology, were His simple and sublime teachings.
The early Christians followed in His footsteps. The first preachers of the faith had no thought of
domination. Entirely animated by His saying, that he among them should be first, who should serve with the greatest devotion, they were humble, modest, and charitable, and they knew how to
communicate this spirit of the inner man to the churches under their direction. These churches were at first but spontaneous meetings of all Christians inhabiting the same locality. A pure and severe
morality, mingled with religious enthusiasm, was the characteristic of each, and excited the admiration even of their persecutors. Everything was in common among them; their property, their joys, and their
sorrows. In the silence of night they met for instruction and to pray together. Their lovefeasts, or fraternal repasts, ended these reunions, in which all differences in social position and rank were effaced
in the presence of a paternal Divinity. Their sole object was to make men better, by bringing them back to a simple worship, of which universal morality was the basis; and to end those numerous and cruel
sacrifices which everywhere inundated with blood the altars of the gods. Thus did Christianity reform

385/641
the world, and obey the teachings of its founder. It gave to woman her proper rank and influence; it regulated domestic life; and by admitting the slaves to the lovefeasts, it by degrees raised them above
that oppression under which half of mankind had groaned for ages.
This, in its purity, as taught by Christ Himself, was the true primitive religion, as communicated by God to the Patriarchs. It was no new religion, but the reproduction of the oldest of all; and its true and
perfect morality is the morality of Masonry, as is the morality of every creed of antiquity.
In the early days of Christianity, there was an initiation like those of the pagans. Persons were admitted on special conditions only. To arrive at a complete knowledge of the doctrine, they had to pass three
degrees of instruction. The initiates were consequently divided into three classes; the first, Auditors, the second, Catechumens, and the third, the Faithful. The Auditors were a sort of novices, who were
prepared by certain ceremonies and certain instruction to receive the dogmas of Christianity.
A portion of these dogmas was made known to the Catechumens; who, after particular purifications, received baptism, or the initiation of the theogenesis (divine generation); but in the grand mysteries of
that religion, the incarnation, nativity, passion, and resurrection of Christ, none were initiated but the Faithful. These doctrines, and the celebration of the Holy Sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, were
kept with profound secrecy. These Mysteries were divided into two parts; the first styled the Mass of the Catechumens; the second, the Mass of the Faithful. The celebration of the Mysteries of Mithras was
also styled a mass; and the ceremonies used were the same. There were found all the sacraments of the Catholic Church, even the breath of confirmation. The Priest of Mithras promised the Initiates
deliverance from sin, by means of confession and baptism, and a future life of happiness or misery. He celebrated the oblation of bread, image of the resurrection. The baptism of newlyborn children,
extreme unction, confession of sins, all belonged to the Mithriac rites. The candidate was purified by a species of baptism, a mark was impressed upon his forehead, he offered bread and water, pronouncing
certain mysterious words.
During the persecutions in the early ages of Christianity, the Christians took refuge in the vast catacombs which stretched for miles in every direction under the city of Rome, and are supposed to
have been of Etruscan origin. There, amid labyrinthine windings, deep caverns, hidden chambers, chapels, and tombs, the persecuted fugitives found refuge, and there they performed the ceremonies of
the Mysteries.
The Basilideans, a sect of Christians that arose soon after the time of the Apostles, practised the Mysteries, with the old Egyptian legend. They symbolized Osiris by the Sun, Isis by the Moon, and
Typhon by Scorpio; and wore crystals bearing these emblems, as amulets or talismans to protect them from danger; upon which were also a brilliant star and the serpent. They were copied from the

386/641
talismans of Persia and Arabia, and given to every candidate, at his initiation.
Iren�aus tells us that the Simonians, one of the earliest sects of the Gnostics, had a Priesthood of the Mysteries.
Tertullian tells us that the Valentinians, the most celebrated of all the Gnostic schools, imitated, or
rather perverted, the Mysteries of Eleusis. Iren�aus informs us, in several curious chapters, of the Mysteries practised by the Marcosians; and Origen gives, much information as to the Mysteries of the
Ophites; and there is no doubt that all the Gnostic sects had Mysteries and an initiation. They all claimed to possess a secret doctrine, coming to them directly from Jesus Christ, different from that of
the Gospels and Epistles, and superior to those communications, which in their eyes, were merely exoteric. This secret doctrine they did not communicate to every one; and among the extensive sect of
the Basilideans hardly one in a thousand knew it, as we learn from Iren�aus. We know the name of only the highest class of their Initiates. They were and Strangers to the World [styled Elect or Elus].
They had at lest three Degrees the Material, the Intellectual, and the Spiritual and the lesser and greater
Mysteries; and the number of those who attained the highest Degree was quite small. Baptism was one of their most important ceremonies; and the Basilideans celebrated the 10th of January, as the
anniversary of the day on which Christ was baptized in Jordan.
They had the ceremony of laying on of hands, by way of purification; and that of the mystic banquet, emblem of that to which they believed the Heavenly Wisdom would one day admit them, in the fullness
of things.
Their ceremonies were much more like those of the Christians than those of Greece; but they mingled with them much that was borrowed from the Orient and Egypt: and taught the primitive truths, mixed
with a multitude of fantastic errors and fictions. The discipline of the secret was the concealment (occultatio) of certain tenets and ceremonies. So says Clemens of Alexandria.
To avoid persecution, the early Christians were compelled to use great precaution, and to hold meetings
of the Faithful [of the Household of Faith] in private places, under concealment by darkness, They assembled in the night, and they guarded against the intrusion of false brethren and profane persons,
spies who might cause their arrest. They conversed together figuratively, and by the use of symbols, lest cowans and eavesdroppers might overhear: and there existed among them a favored class, or Order, who
were initiated into certain Mysteries which they were bound by solemn promise not to disclose, or even converse about, except with such as had received them under the same sanction. They were called
Brethren, the Faithful, Stewards of the Mysteries, Superintendents, Devotees of the Secret, and ARCHITECTS.

In the Hierarchi�, attributed to St. Dionysius the Areopagite, the first Bishop of Athens, the tradition
of the sacrament is said to have been divided into three Degrees, or grades, purification, initiation, and accomplishment or perfection; and it mentions also, as part of the ceremony, the bringing to sight.
The Apostolic Constitutions, attributed to Clemens, Bishop of Rome, describe the early church, and
say: "These regulations must on no account be communicated to all sorts of persons, because of the Mysteries contained in them." They speak of the Deacon's duty to keep the doors, that none uninitiated
should enter at the oblation.
Ostiarii, or doorkeepers, kept guard, and gave notice of the time of prayer and church assemblies; and also by private signal, in times of persecution, gave notice to those within, toe able them to avoid
danger. The Mysteries were open to the Fideles or Faithful only; and no spectators were allowed at the communion.
Tertullian, who died about A. D. 216, says in his Apology: "None are admitted to the religious
Mysteries without an oath of secrecy. We appeal to your Thracian and Eleusinian Mysteries; and we are especially bound to this caution, because if we prove faithless, we should not only provoke Heaven, but
draw upon our heads the utmost rigor of human displeasure. And should strangers betray us? They know nothing but by report and hearsay. Far hence, ye Profane! is the prohibition from all holy
Mysteries."
Clemens, Bishop of Alexandria, born about A.D. 191, says, in his Stromata, that he cannot explain the Mysteries, because he should thereby, according to the old proverb, put a sword into the hands of a
child. He frequently compares the Discipline of the Secret with the heathen Mysteries, as to their internal and recondite wisdom.
Whenever the early Christians happened to be in company with strangers, more properly termed the
Profane, they never spoke of their sacraments, but indicated to one another what they meant by means of symbols and secret watchwords, disguisedly, and as by direct communication of mind with mind,
and by enigmas.
Origen, born A.D. 134 or 135, answering Celsus, who had objected that the Christians had a concealed doctrine said: "Inasmuch as the essential and important doctrines and principles of Christianity are
openly taught, it is foolish to object that there are other things that are recondite; for this is common to Christian discipline with that of those philosophers in whose teaching some things were exoteric and
some esoteric: and it is enough to say that it was so with some of the disciples of Pythagoras."

The formula which the primitive church pronounced at the moment of celebrating its Mysteries, was
this: "Depart, ye Profane! Let the Catechumens, and those who have not been admitted or initiated, go forth."
Archelaus, Bishop of Cascara in Mesopotamia, who, in the year 278, conducted a controversy with the
Manichaeans, said: "These Mysteries the church now communicates to him who has passed through the introductory Degree. They are not explained to the Gentiles at all; nor are they taught openly in the
hearing of Catechumens: but much that is spoken is in disguised terms that theFaithful, who possess the knowledge, may be still more informed, and those who are not acquainted with it, may suffer no
disadvantage."
Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem, was born in the year 315, and died in 386. In his Catechesis he says: "The Lord spake in parables to His hearers in general; but to His disciples He explained in private the
parables and allegories which He spoke in public. The splendor of glory is for those who are early enlightened: obscurity and darkness are the portion of the unbelievers and ignorant. Just so the church
discovers its Mysteries to those who have advanced beyond the class of Catechumens: we employ obscure terms with others."
St. Basil, the Great Bishop of C�sarea, born in the year 326, and dying in the year 376, says: "We
receive the dogmas transmitted to us by writing, and those which have descended to us from the Apostles, beneath the mystery of oral tradition: for several things have been handed to us without
writing, lest the vulgar, too familiar with our dogmas, should lose a due respect for them. This is what the uninitiated are not permitted to contemplate; and how should it ever be proper to write and circulate
among the people an account of them?"
St. Gregory Nazianzen, Bishop of Constantinople, A.D. 379, says: "You have heard as much of the Mystery as we are allowed to speak openly in the ears of all; the rest will be communicated to you in
private; and that you must retain within yourself. Our Mysteries are not to be made
known to strangers."
St. Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, who was born in 340 and died in 393, says in his work De
Mysteriis: "All the Mystery should be kept concealed, guarded by faithful silence, lest it should be inconsiderately divulged to the ears of the Profane. It is not given to all to contemplate the depths of our
Mysteries that they may not be seen by those who ought not to behold them; nor received by those who cannot preserve them."

And in another work: "He sins against God, who divulges to the unworthy the Mysteries confided to him. The danger is not merely in violating truth, but in telling truth, if he allow himself to give hints of
them to those from whom they ought to be concealed Beware of casting pearls before swine!
Every Mystery ought to be kept secret; and, as it were, to be covered over by silence, lest it should rashly be divulged to the ears of the Profane. Take heed that you do not incautiously reveal the
Mysteries!"
St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, who was born in 347, and died in 430, says in one of his discourses: "Having dismissed the Catechumens, we have retained you only to be our hearers; because, besides
those things which belong to all Christians in common, we are now to discourse to you of sublime Mysteries, which none are qualified to hear, but those who, by the Master's favor, are made partakers of
them. To have taught them openly, would have been to betray them." And he refers to the Ark of the Covenant, and says that it signified a Mystery, or secret of God, shadowed over by the cherubim of
glory, and honored by being veiled.
St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine speak of initiation more than fifty times. St. Ambrose writes to those who are initiated; and initiation was not merely baptism, or admission into the church, but it referred to
initiation into the Mysteries. To the baptized and initiated the Mysteries of religion were unveiled; they were kept secret from the Catechumens; who were permitted to hear the Scriptures read and the
ordinary discourses delivered, in which the Mysteries, reserved for the Faithful, were never treated of. When the services and prayers were ended, the Catechumens and spectators all withdrew.
Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople, was born in 354, and died in 417. He says: "I wish to speak
openly: but I dare not, on account of those who are not initiated. I shall therefore avail myself of disguised terms, discoursing in a shadowy manner. Where the holy Mysteries are celebrated, we drive
away all uninitiated persons, and then close the doors." He mentions the acclamations of the initiated; "which," he says, "I here pass over in silence; for it is forbidden to disclose such things to the Profane."
Palladius, in his life of Chrysostom, records, as a great outrage, that, a tumult having been excited against him by his enemies, they forced their way into the penetralia, where the uninitiated beheld what
was not proper for them to see; and Chrysostom mentions the same circumstance in his epistle to Pope Innocent.
St. Cyril of Alexandria, who was made Bishop in 412, and died in 444, says in his 7th Book against
Julian: "These Mysteries are so profound and so exalted, that they can be comprehended by those only who are enlightened. I shall not, therefore, attempt to speak of what is so admirable in them, lest by
discovering them to the uninitiated, I should offend against the injunction not to give what is holy to the impure, nor cast pearls before such as cannot estimate their worth. I should say much more, if I were

not afraid of being heard by those who are uninitiated: because men are apt to deride what they do not understand. And the ignorant, not being aware of the weakness of their minds, condemn what they
ought most to venerate."
Theodoret, Bishop of Cyropolis in Syria, was born in 393, and made Bishop in 420. In one of his three Dialogues, called the Immutable, he introduces Orthodoxus, speaking thus: "Answer me, if you please,
in mystical or obscure terms for perhaps there are some persons present who are not initiated into the Mysteries." And in his preface to Ezekiel, tracing up the secret discipline to the commencement of the
Christian era, he says: "These Mysteries are so august, that we ought to keep them with the greatest caution."
Minucius Felix, an eminent lawyer of Rome, who lived in 212, and wrote a defence of Christianity,
says: "Many of them [the Christians] know each other by tokens and signs (notis et insignibus), and they form a friendship for each other, almost before they become acquainted." The Latin Word, tessera,
originally meant a square piece of wood or stone, used in making tesselated pavements; afterward a tablet on which anything was written, and then a cube or die. Its most general use was to designate a
piece of metal or wood, square in shape, on which the watchword of an Army was inscribed; whence tessera came to mean the watchword itself. There was also a tessera hospitalis, which was a piece of
wood cut into two parts, as a pledge of friendship. Each party kept one of the parts; and they swore mutual fidelity by Jupiter. To break the tessera was considered a dissolution of the friendship. The early
Christians used it as a Mark, the watchword of friendship. With them it was generally in the shape of a fish, and made of bone. On its face was inscribed the word , a fish, the initials of which represented the
Greek words Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour.
St. Augustine (de Fide et Svmbolis) says: "This is the faith which in a few words is given to the Novices to be kept by a symbol; these few words are known to all the Faithful; that by believing they may be
submissive to God; by being thus submissive, they may live rightly; by living rightly, they may purify their hearts and with a pure heart may understand what they believe."
Maximus Taurinus says: "The tessera is a symbol and sign by which to distinguish between the Faithful
and the Profane."
There are three Degrees in Blue Masonry; and in addition to the two words of two syllables each, embodying the binary, three, of three syllables each. There were three Grand Masters, the two Kings,

Hakamah, Binah, and Daath; Gedulah, Geburah, and Tepareth. The candidate makes three circuits of the Lodge there were three assassins of KhirOm, and he was slain by three blows while seeking to
escape by the three gates of the Temple. The ejaculation at his grave was repeated three times. There are three* divisions of the Temple, and three, five, and seven Steps. A Master works with Chalk, Charcoal,
and a vessel of Clay; there are three movable and three immovable jewels. The Triangle appears among the Symbols the two parallel lines enclosing the circle are connected at top, as are the Columns Jachin

This continual reproduction of the number three is not accidental, nor without a profound meaning: and we shall find the same repeated in all the Ancient philosophies.
The Egyptian Gods formed Triads, the third member in each proceeding from the other two. Thus we
have the Triad of Thebes, Amun, Maut, and Kharso; that of Philae, Osiris, Isis, and Horus; that of
Elephantin� and the Cataracts, Neph, Sate, and Anouk�.
Osiris, Isis, and Horus were the Father, Mother, and Son; the latter being Light, the Soul of the World,
the Son, the Protogonos or FirstBegotten. Sometimes this Triad was regarded as SPIRIT, or the active Principle or Generative Power; MATTER, or the PASSIVE Principle or Productive Capacity; and the
Universe, which proceeds from the two Principles.
We also find in Egypt this Triad or Trinity; AmmonRa, the Creator: OsirisRa the Giver of Fruitfulness: HorusRa the Queller of Light; symbolized by the Summer, Autumn, and Spring Sun. For
the Egyptians had but three Seasons, the three gates of the Temple; and on account of the different effects of the Sun on those three Seasons, the Deity appears in these three forms.
The Phoenician Trinity was Ulomos, Chusoros, and the Egg out of which the Universe proceeded. The
Chaldean Triad consisted of Bel, [the Persian Zervana Akherana], Oromasdes, and Ahriman; the Good and Evil Principle alike outflowing from the Father, by their equilibrium and alternating preponderance
to produce harmony. Each was to rule, in turn, for equal periods, until finally the Evil Principle should itself become good.
The Chaldean and Persian oracles of Zoroaster give us the Triad, Fire, Light, and Ether. Orpheus
celebrates the Triad of Phanes, Ouranos, and Kronos. Corry says the Orphic Trinity consisted of Metis, Phanes, and Ericapaeus; Will, Light or Love, and Life.
Acusilaus makes it consist of Metis, Eros, and �ther: Will, Love, and Ether. Phereycides of Syros, of
Fire, Water, and Air or Spirit. In the two former we readily recognize Osiris and Isis, the Sun and the

The first three of the Persian Amshaspands were BAHMAN, the Lord of LIGHT; Ardibehest, the Lord Of FIRE; and Shariver, the Lord of SPLENDOR. These at once lead us back to the Kabala. Plutarch
says: "The better and diviner nature consists of three; the Intelligible (i.e. that and which exists within the Intellect only as yet), and Matter; and that which proceeds from these, which the Greeks call
Kosmos: of which Plato calls the Intelligible, the Idea, the Exemplar, the Father: Matter, the Mother, the Nurse, and the receptacle and place of generation: and the issue of these two, the Offspring and
Genesis."
The Pythagorean fragments say: "Therefore, before the Heaven was made, there existed Idea and Matter, and God the Demiourgos [workman or active instrument], of the former. He made the world out
of matter, perfect, onlybegotten, with a soul and intellect and constituted it a divinity."
Plato gives us Thought, the Father; Primitive Matter, the Mother; and Kosmos, the Son, the issue of the two Principles. Kosmos is the ensouled Universe. With the later Platonists, the Triad was Potence,
Intellect, and Spirit, Philo represents Sanchoniathon's as Fire, Light, and Flame, the three Sons of
Genos; but this is the Alexandrian, not the Ph�nician idea.
Aurelius says the Demiourgos or Creator is triple, and the three Intellects are the three Kings: He who
exists; He who possesses; He who beholds. The first is that which exists by its essence; the second exists in the first, and contains or possesses in itself the Universal of things; all that afterward becomes
the third beholds this Universal, formed and fashioned intellectually, and so having a separate existence. The Third exists in the Second, and the Second in the First.
The most ancient Trinitarian doctrine on record is that of the Brahmins. The Eternal Supreme Essence,
called PARABRAHMA, BRAHM, PARATMA, produced the Universe by selfreflection, and first revealed himself as BRAHMA, the Creating Power, then as VISHNU, the Preserving Power, and lastly
as SIVA, the Destroying and Renovating Power; the three Modes in which the Supreme Essence reveals himself in the material Universe; but which soon to be regarded as three distinct Deities. These three
Deities came they styled the TRIMURTI, or TRIAD.
The Persians received from the Indians the doctrine of the three principles, and changed it to that of a principle of Life, which was individualized by the Sun, and a principle of Death, which was symbolized
by cold and darkness; parallel of the moral world; and in which the continual and alternating struggle between light and darkness, life and death, seemed but a phase of the great struggle between the good
and evil principles, embodied in the legend of ORMUZD and AHRIMAN.

MITHRAS, a Median reformer, was deified after his death, and invested with the attributes of the Sun;
the different astronomical phenomena being figuratively detailed as actual incidents of his life; in the
same manner as the history of BUDDHA was invented among the Hind�s. The Trinity of the Hind�s
became among the Ethiopians and Abyssinians NEPHAMON, PHTHA, and NEITH the God CREATOR, whose emblem was a ram MATTER, or the primitive mud, symbolized by a globe or an
egg, and THOUGHT, or the LIGHT which contains the germ of everything; triple manifestation of one and the same God (ATHOM), considered in three aspects, as the creative power, goodness, and
wisdom. Other Deities were speedily invented; and among them OSTRIS, represented by the Sun, ISIS, his wife, by the Moon or Earth, TYPHON, his Brother, the Principle of Evil and Darkness, who was the
son of Osiris and Isis. And the Trinity of OSIRIS, ISIS, and HORUS became subsequently the Chief Gods and objects of worship of the Egyptians.
The ancient Etruscans (a race that emigrated from the Rh�tian Alps into Italy, along whose route
evidences of their migration have been discovered, and whose language none have yet succeeded in reading) acknowledged only one Supreme God; but they had images for His different attributes, and
temples to these images. Each town had one National Temple, dedicated to the three great attributes of God, STRENGTH, RICHES, and WISDOM, or Tina, Talna, and Minerva. The National Deity was
always a Triad under one roof; and it was the same in Egypt, where one Supreme God alone was acknowledged, but was worshipped as a Triad, with different names in each different home. Each city in
Etruria might have as many gods and gates and temples as it pleased; but three sacred gates, and one Temple to three Divine Attributes were obligatory, wherever the laws of Tages (or Taunt or Thoth) were
received. The only gate that remains in Italy, of the olden time, undestroyed, is the Porta del Circo at Volterra; and it has upon it the three heads of the three National Divinities, one upon the keystone of its
magnificent arch, and one above each sidepillar.
The Buddhists hold that the God SAKYA of the Hind�s, called in Ceylon, GAUTAMA, in India beyond the Ganges, SOMONAKODOM, and in China, CHYKIA, or Fo, constituted a Trinity
[TRIRATNA], of BUDDHA, DHARMA, and SANGA, Intelligence, Law, and Union or Harmony. The
Chinese Sab�ans represented the Supreme Deity as composed of CHANGTI, the Supreme Sovereign;
TIEN, the Heavens; and TAO, the Universal Supreme Reason and Principle of Faith; and that from Chaos, an immense silence, an immeasurable void. without perceptible forms, alone, infinite,
immutable, moving in a circle in illimitable space, without change or alteration, when vivified by the Principle of Truth, issued all Beings, under the influence of TAO, Principle of Faith, who produced
one, one produced two, two produced three, and three produced all that is.
The SclavonoVendes typified the Trinity by the three heads of the God TRIGLAV; and the Pruczi or Prussians by the Triune God, PERKOUN, PIKOLLOS, and POTRIMPOS, the Deities of Light and
Thunder, of Hell and the Earth, its fruits and animals and the Scandinavians by ODIN, FREA, and THOR.

In the KABALAH, or the Hebrew traditional philosophy, the Infinite Deity, beyond the reach of the
Human Intellect, and without Name, Form, or Limitation, was represented as developing Himself, in order to create, and by selflimitation, in ten emanations or outflowings, called SEPHIROTH, or rays,
The first of these, in the world AZILUTH, that is, within the Deity, was KETHER, or the Crown, by which we understand the Divine Will or Potency. Next came, as a pair, HAI",MAH and BAINAH,
ordinarily translated "Wisdom" and "Intelligence," the former termed the FATHER, and the latter the MOTHER. HAKEMAH is the active Power or Energy of Deity, by which He produces within Himself
Intellection or Thinking and BAINAH, the passive Capacity, from which, acted on by the Power, the Intellection flows. This Intellection is called DAATH and it is the "WORD," of Plato and the Gnostics;
the unuttered word, within the Deity. Here is the origin of the Trinity of the Father, the Mother or Holy Spirit, and the Son or Word.
Another Trinity was composed of the fourth Sephirah, GEDULAH or KHASW, Benignity or Mercy,
also termed FATHER (Aba); the fifth, GEBURAH, Severity or Strict Justice, also termed the MOTHER (Imma); and the sixth, the SON or Issue of these, TIPHARETH, Beauty or Harmony.
"Everything," says the SOHAR, �proceeds according to the Mystery of the Balance" that is, by the equilibrium of Opposites and thus from the Infinite Mercy and the Infinite justice, in equilibrium, flows
the perfect Harmony of the Universe. Infinite POWER, which is Lawless, and Infinite WISDOM, in Equilibrium, also produce BEAUTY or HARMONY, as Son, Issue, or Result the Word, or utterance of
the Thought of God. Power and Justice or Severity are the same Wisdom and Mercy or Benignity are the same; in the Infinite Divine Nature.
According to Philo of Alexandria, the Supreme Being, Primitive Light or Archetype of Light, uniting
with WISDOM [ ], the mother of Creation, forms in Himself the types of all things, and acts upon the Universe through the WORD [Logos], who dwells in God, and in whom all His powers and attributes
develop themselves; a doctrine borrowed by him from Plato.
Simon Magus and his disciples taught that the Supreme Being or Centre of Light produced first of all, three couples of united Existences, of both sexes, [Suzugias], which were the origins of all things
REASON and INVENTIVENESS; SPEECH and THOUGHT; and CALCULATION and
REFLECTION and N�us and Epinoia, Ph�ne and Ennoia, Logismos and Enthum�sis]; of which
Ennoia or WISDOM was the first produced, and Mother of all that exists.
Other Disciples of Simon and with them most of the Gnostics, adopting and Pler�ma, or PLENITUDE of modifying the doctrine, taught that the Superior Intelligences, having the Supreme
Being at their head, was composed of eight Eons [Ai�nes] of different sexes; PROFUNDITY and
SILENCE; SPIRIT and TRUTH; the WORD and LIFE; MAN and the CHURCH [Buthos and Sig�;
Pneuma and Aletheia; Logos and and Z�e; Anthr�pos and Ekkl�sia].

Bardesanes, whose doctrines the Syrian Christians long embraced, taught that the unknown Father,
happy in the Plenitude of His Life and Perfections, first produced a Companion for Himself [Suzugos], whom He placed in the Celestial Paradise and who became, by Him, the Mother of CHRISTOS, Son of
the Living God i.e. (laying aside the allegory), that the Eternal conceived, in the silence of His decrees, the Thought of revealing Himself by a Being who should be His image or His Son that to the Son
succeeded his Sister and Spouse, the Holy Spirit, and they produced four Spirits of the elements, male and female, Maio and Jabseho, Nouro and Rucho; then Seven Mystic Couples of Spirits, and Heaven
and Earth, and all that is; then seven spirits governing the planets, twelve governing the Constellations of the Zodiac, and thirtysix Starry Intelligences whom he called Deacons while the Holy Spirit
[Sophia Achamoth], being both the Holy Intelligence and the Soul of the physical world, went from the
Pler�ma into that material world and there mourned her degradation, until CHRISTOS, her former
spouse, coming to her with his Divine Light and Love, guided her in the way to purification, and she again united herself with him as his primitive Companion.
Basilides, the Christian Gnostic, taught that there were seven emanations from the Supreme Being, The
Firstborn, Thought, the Word, Reflection, Wisdom, Power, and Righteousness [and Protogonos, Nous,
Logos, Phronesis, Sophia, Dunamis, and Dikarosun�]; from whom emanated other Intelligences in
succession, to the number, in all, of three hundred and sixtyfive; which were God manifested, and composed the Plenitude of the Divine Emanations, or the God Abraxas; of which the Thought [or
Intellect, Nous] united itself, by baptism in the river Jordan, with the man Jesus, servant [Diakonos] of the human race; but did not suffer with Him; and the disciples of Basilides taught that the put on the
appearance only of humanity, and that Simon of Cyrene was crucified in His stead and ascended into Heaven.
Basilides held that out of the unrevealed God, who is at the head, of the world of emanations, and
exalted above all conception or designation, were evolved seven living, selfsubsistent, everactive hyposatized powers:
1st. NOUS .................
2d. LOGOS ...............

These Seven Powers (Dunameis), with the Primal Ground out of which they were evolved, constituted in his scheme the [Prote Ogdoas], or First Octave, the root of all Existence. From this point, the
spiritual life proceeded to evolve out of itself continually many gradations of existence, each lower one being still the impression, the antetype, of the immediate higher one. He supposed there were 365 of
these regions or gradations, expressed by the mystical word
FIRST: THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS
The Mind
The Reason
The Thinking Power
Wisdom
Might, accomplishing the purposes of Wisdom
THIRD: THE MORAL ATTRIBUTES
Holiness or Moral Perfection
Inward Tranquility

�. a,1 �. x,60.. a,1 . . x 200 = 365 which is the whole EmanationWorld, as the development of the
Supreme Being.
In the system of Basilides, Light, Life, Soul, and Good were opposed to Darkness, Death, Matter, and Evil, throughout the whole course of the Universe.
According to the Gnostic view, God was represented as the immanent, incomprehensible and original
source of all perfection; the unfathomable ABYSS (buthos), according to Valentinus, exalted above all possibility of designation; of whom, properly speaking, nothing can be predicated; the of Basilides, the
of Philo. From this incomprehensible Essence of God, an immediate transition to finite things is inconceivable. Selflimitation is the first beginning of a communication of life on the part of God the
first passing of the hidden Deity into manifestation; and from this proceeds all further selfdeveloping manifestation of the Divine Essence. From this primal link in the chain of life there are evolved, in the

first place, the manifold powers or attributes inherent in the divine Essence, which, until that first self comprehension, were all hidden in the Abyss of His Essence. Each of these attributes presents the
whole divine Essence under one particular aspect; and to each, therefore, in this respect, the title of God may appropriately be applied. These Divine Powers evolving themselves to selfsubsistence, become
thereupon the germs and principles of all further developments of life.
The life contained in them unfolds and individualizes itself more and more, but in such a way that the successive grades of this evolution of life continually sink lower and lower; the spirits become feebler,
the further they are removed from the first link in the series.
The first manifestation they termed heautou] or was hypostatically represented in a or [prot�
katal�psis [proton katal�pton tou Theou]; which [Nous or Logos].
In the Alexandrian Gnosis, the Platonic notion of the [Hul�] predominates. This is the dead, the
unsubstantial the boundary that limits from without the evolution of life in its gradually advancing progression, whereby the Perfect is ever evolving itself into the less Perfect. This again, is represented
under various images; at one time as the darkness that exists alongside of the light; at another, as the
void [Kenoma, Kenon], in opposition to the Fullness, [Pl�roma] of the Divine Life; or as the shadow
that accompanies the light; or as the chaos, or the sluggish, stagnant, dark water. This matter, dead in itself, possesses by its own nature no inherent tendency; as life of every sort is foreign to it, itself makes
no encroachment on the Divine. As, however, the evolutions of the Divine Life (the essences developing themselves out of the progressive emanation) become feebler, the further they are removed
from the first link in the series; and as their connection with the first becomes looser at each successive step, there arises at the last step of the evolution, an imperfect, defective product, which, unable to
retain its connection with the chain of Divine Life, sinks from the World of Eons into the material chaos: or, according to the same notion, somewhat differently expressed [according to the Ophites and
to Bardesanes], a drop from the fullness of the Divine life bubbles over into the bordering void. Hereupon the dead matter, by commixture with the living principle, which it wanted, first of all
receives animation. But, at the same time, also, the divine, the living, becomes corrupted by mingling with the chaotic mass. Existence now multiplies itself. There arises a subordinate, defective life; there is
ground for a new world; a creation starts into being, beyond the confines of the world of emanation. But, on the other hand, since the chaotic principle of matter has acquired vitality, there now arises a
more distinct and more active opposition to the Godlike a barely negative, blind, ungodly nature power, which obstinately resists all influence of the Divine; hence, as products of the spirit of the (of
the Pneuma Hulikon), are Satan, malignant spirits, wicked men, in none of whom is there any reasonable or moral principle, or any principle of a rational will; but blind passions alone have the
ascendency. In them there is the same conflict, as the scheme of Platonism supposes, between the soul under the guidance of Divine reason [the Nous], and the soul blindly resisting reason between the
[pronoia] and the [anag�], the Divine Principle and the natural.

The Syrian Gnosis assumed the existence of an active, turbulent kingdom of evil, or of darkness, which, by its encroachments on the kingdom of light, brought about a commixture of the light with the
darkness, of the Godlike with the ungodlike.
Even among the Platonists, some thought that along with an organized, inert matter, the substratum of the corporeal world, there existed from the beginning a blind, lawless motive power, an ungodlike soul,
as its original motive and active principle. As the inorganic matter was organized into a corporeal world, by the plastic power of the Deity, so by the same power, law and reason were communicated to
that turbulent, irrational soul. Thus the chaos of the was transformed into an organized world, and that blind soul into a rational principle, a mundane soul, animating the Universe. As from the latter proceeds
all rational, spiritual life in humanity, so from the former proceeds all that is irrational, all that is under the blind sway of passion and appetite; and all malignant spirits are its progeny.
In one respect all the Gnostics agreed they all held, that there was a world purely emanating out of the
vital development of God, a creation evolved directly out of the Divine Essence, far exalted above any outward creation produced by God's plastic power, and conditioned by preexisting matter. They agreed
in holding that the framer of this lower world was not the Father of that higher world of emanation; but the Demiurge, a being of a kindred nature with the Universe framed and governed by him, and far
inferior to that higher system and the Father of it.
But some, setting out from ideas which had long prevailed among certain Jews of Alexandria, supposed that the Supreme God created and governed the world by His ministering spirits, by the angels. At the
head of these angels stood one who had the direction and control of all; therefore called the Artificer and Governor of the World. This Demiurge they compared with the plastic, animating, mundane spirit
of Plato and Deuteros Theos; the Platonists [the Theos Genetos], who, moreover, according to the
Tim�us of Plato, strives to represent the IDEA of the Divine Reason, in that which is becoming (as
contradistinguished from that which is) and temporal. This angel is a representative of the Supreme God, on the lower stage of existence: he does not act independently, but merely according to the ideas
inspired in him by the Supreme God; just as the plastic, mundane soul of the Platonists creates all
things after the pattern of the ideas communicated Nous the by the Supreme Reason [ho esti z�on the
paradeigma, of the Divine Reason hypostatized].
But these ideas transcend his limited essence; he cannot understand them; he is merely their unconscious organ; and therefore is unable himself to comprehend the whole scope and meaning of the
work which lie performs. As an organ under the guidance of a higher inspiration, he reveals higher truths than he himself can comprehend. The mass of the Jews, they held, recognized not the angel, by
whom, in all the Theophanies of the Old Testament, God revealed Himself; they knew not the Demiurge in his true relation to the hidden Supreme God, who never reveals Himself in the sensible
world. They confounded the type and the archetype, the symbol and the idea. They rose no higher than

the Demiurge; they took him to be the Supreme God Himself. But the spiritual men among them, on the contrary, clearly perceived, or at least divined, the ideas veiled under Judaism; they rose beyond the
Demiurge, to a knowledge of the Supreme God; and are therefore properly His Therapeutai worshippers [Other Gnostics, who had not been followers of the Mosaic religion, but who had, at an earlier period,
framed to themselves an oriental Gnosis, regarded the Demiurge as a being absolutely hostile to the Supreme God].
He and his angels, notwithstanding their finite nature, wish to establish their independence: they will
tolerate no foreign rule within their realm. Whatever of a higher nature descends into their kingdom, they seek to hold imprisoned there, lest it should raise itself above their narrow precincts. Probably, in
this system, the kingdom of the Demiurgic Angels corresponded, for the most part, with that of the deceitful StarSpirits, who seek to rob man of his freedom, to beguile him by various arts of deception,
and who exercise a tyrannical sway over the things of this world. Accordingly, in the system of these
Sab�ans, the seven Planet Spirits, and the twelve StarSpirits of the zodiac, who sprang from an
irregular connection between the cheated Fetahil and the Spirit of Darkness, play an important part in everything that is bad. The Demiurge is a limited and limiting being, proud, jealous, and revengeful;
and this his character betrays itself in the Old Testament, which, the Gnostics held, came from him. They transferred to the Demiurge himself, whatever in the idea of God, as presented by the Old
Testament, appeared to them defective. Against his will and rule the was continually rebelling, revolting without control against the dominion which he, the fashioner, would exercise over it, casting off the
yoke imposed on it, and destroying the work he had begun.
The same jealous being, limited in his power, ruling with despotic sway, they imagined they saw in nature. He strives to check the germination of the divine seeds of life which the Supreme God of
Holiness and Love, who has no connection whatever with the sensible world, has scattered among men. That perfect God was at most known and worshipped in Mysteries by a few spiritual men.
The Gospel of St. John is in great measure a polemic against the Gnostics, whose different sects, to
solve the great problems, the creation of a material world by an immaterial Being, the fall of man, the incarnation, the redemption and restoration of the spirits called men, admitted a long series of
intelligences, intervening in a series of spiritual operations; and which they designated by the names, The Beginning, the Word, the OnlyBegotten, Life, Light, and Spirit [Ghost]: in Greek, Mo and
[Arch�, Logos, Monogen�s, Z�e, Ph�s, and Pneuma]. St. John, at the beginning of his Gospel, avers that it was Jesus Christ who existed in the Beginning; that He was the WORD of God by which
everything was made; that He was the OnlyBegotten, the Life and the Light, and that He diffuses among men the Holy Spirit [or Ghost], the Divine Life and Light.
So the Pl�roma, Plenitude or Fullness, was a favorite term with the Gnostics, and Truth and Grace
were the Gnostic Eons; and the Simonians, Dok�t�s, and other Gnostics held that the Eon Christ

Jesus was never really, but only apparently clothed with a human body but St. John replies that the
Word did really become Flesh, and dwelt among us; and that in Him were the Pl�roma and Truth and
Grace.
In the doctrine of Valentinus, reared a Christian at Alexandria, God was a perfect Being, an Abyss [Buthos], which no intelligence could sound, because no eye could reach the invisible and ineffable
heights on which He dwelt, and no mind could comprehend the duration of His existence; He has
always been; He is the Primitive Father and Beginning and [the Propat�r and Proarch�] He will BE
always, and does not grow old. The development of His Perfections produced the intellectual world. After having passed infinite ages in repose and silence, He manifested Himself by His Thought, source
of all His manifestations, and which received from Him the germ of His Ennoia] is also creations.
Being of His Being, His Thought termed [Charis], Grace or Joy, and , or [Sig� or Arr�ton], Silence
or the Ineffable. Its first manifestation was [Nous], the Intelligence, first of the Eons, commencement of
all things, first revelation of the Divinity, the [Monogen�s], or OnlyBegotten next, Truth [Al �theia],
his companion. Their manifestations were the Word Zo� and theirs, Man and the Church and Logos
and Life [and Anthr�pos and Ekkl�sia] and from these, other twelve, six of whom were Hope, Faith,
Charity, Intelligence, Happiness, and Wisdom; or, in the Hebrew, Kesten, Kina, Amphe, Ouananim, Thaedes, and Oubina. The harmony of the Eons, struggling to know and be united to the Primitive God,
was disturbed, and to redeem and restore them, the Intelligence produced Christ and the Holy Spirit His companion; who restored them to their first estate of happiness and harmony; and thereupon they
formed the Eon Jesus, born of a Virgin, to whom the Christos united himself in baptism and who, with his Companion SophiaAchamoth, saved and redeemed the world.
The Marcosians taught that the Supreme Deity produced by His words the [Logos] or Plenitude of
Eons: His first utterance was a syllable of four letters, each of which became a being; His second of
four, His third of ten, and His fourth of twelve; thirty in all, which constituted the f [Pl�roma].
The Valentinians, and others of the Gnostics, distinguished three orders of existences: 1st. The divine
germs of life, exalted by their nature above matter, and akin to the (Sophia], to the mundane soul and to
the Pl�roma; the spiritual natures, [Phuseis Pneumatikai]: 2d. The natures originating in the life,
divided from the former by the mixture, the psychical natures, of the [Phuseis Psuchikai]; with which begins a perfectly new order of existence, an image of that higher mind and system, in a subordinate
grade; and finally, 3d. The Ungodlike or Hylic Nature, which resists all amelioration, and whose tendency is only to destroy the nature of blind lust and passion.
The nature of the relationship with God (the [pneumatikon], the spiritual, is essential (Homoousion t �
The�) hence the life of Unity, the undivided, the, absolutely simple (Ousia henike, monoeides).

[psuchikoi) is disruption into multiplicity, The essence of the manifoldness; which, however, is subordinate to a higher unity, by which it allows itself to be guided, first unconsciously, then
consciously. The essence of the [Hulikoi] (of whom Satan is the head), is the direct opposite to all unity; disruption and disunion in itself, without the least sympathy, without any point of coalescence
whatever for unity; together with an effort to destroy all unity, to extend its own inherent disunion to everything, and to rend everything asunder. This principle has no power to posit anything; but only to
negative it is unable to create, to produce, to form, but only to destroy, to decompose.
By Marcus, the disciple of Valentinus, the idea of a [Logos Tou Ontos], of a WORD, manifesting the hidden Divine Essence, in the Creation, was spun out into the most subtle details the entire creation
being, in his view, a continuous utterance of the Ineffable. The way in which the germs of divine life [the spermata pneumatika], which lie shut up in the Eons, continually unfold and individualize them
selves more and more, is represented as a spontaneous analysis of the several names of the Ineffable,
into their several sounds. An echo of the Pl�roma falls down into the [HuI�], and becomes the
forming of a new but lower creation.
One formula of the pneumatical baptism among the Gnostics ran thus: "In the NAME which is hidden from all the Divinities and Powers" [of the Demiurge], "The Name of Truth" [the [Aletheial, self
manifestation of the Buthos], which Jesus of Nazareth has put on in the lightzones of Christ, the living Christ, through the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the angels, the Name by which all things attain to
Perfection." The candidate then said: "I am established and redeemed; I am redeemed in my soul from this world, and from all that belongs to it, by the name of , who has redeemed the Soul of Jesus by the
living Christ." The assembly then said: "Peace (or Salvation) to all on whom this name rests!"
The boy Dionusos, torn in pieces, according to the Bacchic Mysteries, by the Titans, was considered by the Manicheans as simply representing the Soul, swallowed up by the powers of darkness, the divine
life rent into fragments by matter: that part of the luminous essence of the primitive man [the [Protos
Anthropos] of Mani, the [Pra�n Anthr�pos] of the Valentinians, the Adam Kadmon of the Kabalah;
and the Kalomorts of the Zendavesta], swallowed up by the powers of darkness; the Mundane Soul, mixed with matter the seed of divine life, which had fallen into matter, and had thence to undergo a
process of purification and development.
The [Gnosis] of Carpocrates and his son Epiphanes consisted in the knowledge of one Supreme Original being, the highest unity, from whom all existence has emanated, and to whom it strives to
return. The finite spirits that rule over the several portions of the Earth, seek to counteract this universal tendency to unity; and from their influence, their laws, and arrangements, proceeds all that checks,
disturbs, or limits the original communion, which is the basis of nature, as the outward manifestation of that highest Unity. These spirits, moreover, seek to retain
under their dominion the souls which, emanating from the highest Unity, and still partaking of its

nature, have lapsed into the corporeal world, and have there been imprisoned in bodies, in order, under their dominion, to be kept within the cycle of migration. From these finite spirits, the popular religions
of different nations derive their origin. But the souls which, from a reminiscence of their former condition, soar upward to the contemplation of that higher Unity, reach to such perfect freedom and
repose, as nothing afterward can disturb or limit, and rise superior to the popular deities and religions. As examples of this sort, they named Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and Christ. They made no distinction
between the latter and the wise and good men of every nation. They taught that any other soul which could soar to the same height of contemplation, might be regarded as equal with Him.
The Ophites commenced their system with a Supreme Being, long unknown to the Human race, and
still so the greater number of men; the [Buthos], or Profundity, Source of Light, and of AdamKadmon, the Primitive Man, made by the Demiourgos, but perfected by the Supreme God by the communication
to him of the Spirit [Pneuma]. The first emanation was the Thought of the Supreme Deity [the Ennoia],
the conception of the Universe in the Thought of God. This Thought, called also Silence (Sig�),
produced the Spirit [Pneuma], Mother of the Living, and Wisdom of God. Together with this Primitive Existence, Matter existed also (the Waters, Darkness, Abyss, and Chaos), eternal like the Spiritual
Principle. Buthos and His Thought, uniting with Wisdom, made her fruitful by the Divine Light, and she produced a perfect and an imperfect being, Christos, and a Second and inferior wisdom, Sophia
Achamoth, who falling into chaos remained entangled there, became enfeebled, and lost all knowledge of the Superior Wisdom that gave her birth. Communicating movement to Chaos, she produced
Ialdabaoth, the Demiourgos, Agent of Material Creation, and then ascended toward her first place in the scale of creation. laldabaoth produced an angel that was his image, and this a second, and so on in
succession to the sixth after the Demiourgos the seven being reflections one of the other, yet different and inhabiting seven distinct regions. The names of the six thus produced were IAO, SABAOTH,
ADONAI, ELOI, ORAI, and ASTAPHAL Ialdabaoth, to become independent of his mother, and to pass for the Supreme Being, made the world, and man, in his own image; and his mother caused the
Spiritual principle to pass from him into man so made; and henceforward the contest between the Demiourgos and his mother, between light and darkness, good and evil, was concentrated in man; and
the image of Ialdabaoth, reflected upon matter, became the SerpentSpirit, Satan, the Evil Intelligence. Eve, created by Ialdabaoth, had by Us Sons children that were angels like themselves. The Spiritual
light was withdrawn from man by Sophia, and the world surrendered to the influence of evil; until the Spirit, urged by the entreaties of Wisdom, induced the Supreme Being to send Christos to redeem it.
Compelled, despite himself, by his Mother, Ialdabaoth caused the man Jesus to be born of a Virgin, and the Celestial Saviour, uniting with his Sister, Wisdom, descended through the regions of the seven
angels, appeared in each under the form of its chief, concealed his own, and entered with his sister into the man Jesus at the baptism in Jordan. Ialdabaoth, finding that Jesus was destroying his empire and
abolishing his worship, caused the Jews to hate and crucify Him; before which happened, Christos and Wisdom had ascended to the celestial regions. They restored Jesus to life and gave Him an ethereal
body, in which He remained eighteen months on earth, and receiving from Wisdom the perfect knowledge [Gnosis], communicated it to a small number of His apostles, and then arose to the
intermediate region inhabited by laldabaoth, where, unknown to him, He sits at his right hand, taking from him the Souls of Light purified by Christos. When nothing of the Spiritual world shall remain

subject to laldabaoth, the redemption will be accomplished, and the end of the world, the completion of the return of Light into the Plenitude, will occur.
Tatian adopted the theory of Emanation, of Eons, of the existence of a God too sublime to allow
Himself to be known, but displaying Himself by Intelligences emanating from His bosom. The first of these was His spirit [Pneuma], God Himself, God thinking, God conceiving the Universe. The second
was the Word [Logos], no longer merely the Thought or Conception, but the Creative Utterance, manifestation of the Divinity, but emanating from the Thought or Spirit; the FirstBegotten, author of
the visible creation. This was the Trinity, composed of the Father, Spirit, and Word.
The Elxa�tes adopted the Seven Spirits of the Gnostics; but named them Heaven, Water, Spirit, The Holy Angels of Prayer, Oil, Salt, and the Earth. The opinion of the Doketes as to the human nature of
Jesus Christ, was that most generally received among the Gnostics. They deemed the intelligences of the Superior World too pure and too much the antagonists of matter, to be willing to unite with it: and
held that Christ, an Intelligence of the first rank, in appearing upon the earth, did not become confounded with matter, but took upon Himself only the appearance of a body, or at the most used it
only as an envelope.
No�tus termed the Son the first Utterance of the Father; the Word, not by Himself, as an Intelligence, and unconnected with the flesh, a real Son; but a Word, and a perfect OnlyBegotten; light emanated
from the Light; water flowing from its spring; a ray emanated from the Sun.
Paul of Samosata taught that Jesus Christ was the Son of Joseph and Mary; but that the Word, Wisdom, or Intelligence of God, the [Nous] of the Gnostics, had united itself with Him, so that He might be said
to be at once the Son of God, and God Himself.
Arius called the Saviour the first of creatures, nonemanated from God, but really created, by the direct will of God, before time and the ages. According to the Church, Christ was of the same nature as God;
according to some dissenters, of the same nature as man. Arius adopted the theory of a nature analogous to both. When God resolved to create the Human race, He made a Being which He called
THE WORD, THE SON, WISDOM [Logos, Uios, Sophia], to the end that He might give existence to men. This WORD is the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ensoph of the Kabalah, the of Platonism and
Philonism, and the or [Sophia or Demiourgos] of the Gnostics. He distinguished the Inferior Wisdom, or the daughter, from the Superior Wisdom; the latter being in God, inherent in His nature, and
incapable of communication to any creature; the second, by which the Son was made, communicated itself to Him, and therefore He Himself was entitled to be called the Word and the Son.

Persian Magi, profited by the doctrines of Scythianus, a Kabalist or Judaizing Gnostic of the times of the Apostles; and knowing those of Bardesanes and Harmonius, derived his doctrines from
Zoroasterism, Christianity, and Gnosticism. He claimed to be the [Parakl�tos] or Comforter, in the Sense of a Teacher, organ of the Deity, but not in that of the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost; and commenced
his Epistola Fundamenti in these words: "Manes, Apostle of Jesus Christ, elect of God the Father; Behold the Words of Salvation, emanating from the living and eternal fountain." The dominant idea of
his doctrine was Pantheism, derived by him from its source in the regions of India and on the confines of China: that the cause of all that exists is in God; and at last, God is all in all. All souls are equal God
is in all, in men, animals, and plants. There are two Gods, one of Good and the other of Evil, each independent, eternal, chief of a distinct Empire; necessarily, and of their very natures, hostile to one
another. The Evil God, Satan, is the Genius of matter alone. The God of Good is infinitely his Superior, the True God; while the other is but the chief of all that is the Enemy of God, and must in the end
succumb to His Power. The Empire of Light alone is eternal and true; and this Empire is a great chain of Emanations, all connected with the Supreme Being which they make manifest; all Him, under
different forms, chosen for one end, the triumph of the Good. In each of His members lie hidden thousands of ineffable treasures. Excellent in His Glory, incomprehensible in His Greatness, the Father
has joined to Himself those fortunate, and glorious Eons [Aion�s], whose Power and Number it is impossible to determine. This is Spinoza's Infinity of Infinite Attributes of God. Twelve Chief Eons, at
the head of all, were the Genii of the twelve Constellations of the Zodiac, and called by Manes, Olamin. Satan, also, Lord of the Empire of Darkness, had an Army of Eons or Demons, emanating from his
Essence, and reflecting more or less his image, but divided and inharmonious among themselves. A war among them brought them to the confines of the Realm of Light.
Delighted, they sought to conquer it. But the Chief of the Celestial Empire created a Power which he
placed on the frontiers of Heaven to protect his Eons, and destroy the Empire of Evil. This was the Mother of Life, the Soul of the World, an Emanation from the Supreme Being, too pure to come in
immediate contact with matter. It remained in the highest region; but produced a Son, the first Man [the Kaiomorts, AdamKadmon, [Protos Anthropos,] and HivilZivah; of the ZendAvesta, the Kabalah, the
Gnosis, and Sabeism]; who commenced the contest with the Powers of Evil, but, losing part of his panoply, of his Light, his Son and many souls born of the Light, who were devoured by the darkness,
God sent to his assistance the living Spirit, or the Son of the First Man [Uios Anthropou], or Jesus Christ. The Mother of Life, general Principle of Divine Life, and the first Man, Primitive being that
reveals the Divine Life, are too sublime to be connected with the Empire of Darkness.
The Son of Man or Soul of the World, enters into the Darkness, becomes its captive, to end by tempering and softening its savage nature. The Divine Spirit, after having brought back the Primitive
Man to the Empire of Light, raises above the world that part of the Celestial Soul that remained unaffected by being mingled with the Empire of Darkness. Placed in the region of the Sun and Moon,
this pure soul, the Son of Man, the Redeemer or Christ, labors to deliver and attract to Himself that part of the Light or of the Soul of the First Man diffused through matter; which done, the world will cease to
exist. To retain the rays of Light still remaining among his Eons, and ever tending to escape and return,

by concentrating them, the Prince of Darkness, with their consent, made Adam, whose soul was of the Divine Light, contributed by the Eons, and his body of matter, so that he belonged to both Empires, that
of Light and that of Darkness. To prevent the light from escaping at once, the Demons forbade Adam to eat the fruit of "knowledge of good and evil," by which he would have known the Empire of Light and
that of Darkness. He obeyed; an Angel of Light induced him to transgress, and gave him the means of victory; but the Demons created Eve, who seduced him into an act of Sensualism, that enfeebled him,
and bound him anew in the bonds of matter. This is repeated in the case of every man that lives.
To deliver the soul, captive in darkness, the Principle of Light, or Genius of the Sun, charged to redeem the Intellectual World, of which he is the type, came to manifest Himself among men. Light appeared in
the darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not; according to the words
of St. John. The Light could not unite with the darkness. It but put on the appearance of a human body,
and took the name of Christ in the Messiah, only to accommodate itself to the language of the Jews. The Light did its work, turning the Jews from the adoration of the Evil
Principle, and the Pagans from the worship of Demons. But the Chief of the Empire of Darkness caused Him to be crucified by the Jews. Still He suffered in appearance only, and His death gave to all souls
the symbol of their enfranchisement. The person of Jesus having disappeared, there
was seen in His place a cross of Light, over which a celestial voice pronounced these words: "The cross
of Light is called The Word, Christ, The Gate, Joy, The Bread, The Sun, The Resurrection, Jesus, The Father, The Spirit, Life, Truth, and Grace."
With the Priscillianists there were two principles, one the Divinity, the other, Primitive Matter and
Darkness; each eternal. Satan is the son and lord of matter; and the secondary angels and demons, children of matter. Satan created and governs the visible world. But the soul of man emanated from
God, and is of the same substance with God. Seduced by the evil spirits, it passes through various bodies, until, purified and reformed, it rises to God and is strengthened by His light. These powers of
evil hold mankind in ledge; and to redeem this pledge, the Saviour, Christ the Redeemer, came and died upon the cross of expiation, thus discharging the written obligation. He, like all souls, was of the same
substance with God, a manifestation of the Divinity, no forming a second person; unborn, like the Divinity, and nothing else than the Divinity under another form.
It is useless to trace these vagaries further; and we stop at the frontiers of the realm of the three hundred
and sixtyfive thousand emanations of the Manda �tes from the Primitive Light, Fira or Ferho and Yavar; and return contentedly to the simple and sublime creed of Masonry.

the creation of a material universe by an Immaterial Deity, have interposed between the two, and between God and man, divers manifestations of, or emanations from, or personified attributes or agents
of, the Great Supreme God, who is coexistent with Time and coextensive with Space.
The universal belief of the Orient was, that the Supreme Being did not Himself create either the earth or man. The fragment which commences the Book of Genesis, consisting of the first chapter and the
three first verses of the second, assigns the creation or rather the formation or modelling of the world from matter already existing in confusion, not to lHUH, but to the ALHIM, well known as Subordinate
Deities, Forces, or Manifestations, among the Ph�nicians. The second fragment imputes it to IHUH ALHIM,* and St. John assigns the creation to the or WORD; and asserts that CHRIST was that
WORD, as well as LIGHT and LIFE, other emanations from the Great Primeval Deity, to which other faiths had assigned the work of creation.
An absolute existence, wholly immaterial, in no way within the reach of our senses; a cause, but not an
effect that never was not, but existed during an infinity of eternities, before there was anything else except Time and Space, is wholly beyond the reach of our conceptions. The mind of man has wearied
itself in speculations as to His nature, His essence, His attributes; and ended in being no wiser than it began. In the impossibility of conceiving of immateriality, we feel at sea and lost whenever we go
beyond the domain of matter. And yet we know that there are Power* The Substance, or Very Self, of which the Alohayim are the manifestations.
Forces, Causes, that are themselves not matter. We give them names, but what they really are, and what
their essence, we are wholly ignorant. But, fortunately, it does not follow that we may not believe, or even know, that which we cannot explain to ourselves, or that which is beyond the reach of our
comprehension. If we believed only that which our intellect can grasp, measure, comprehend, and have distinct and clear ideas of, we should believe scarce anything. The senses are not the witnesses that bear
testimony to us of the loftiest truths.
Our greatest difficulty is, that language is not adequate to express our ideas; because our words refer to things, and are images of what is substantial and material. If we use the word "emanation", our mind
involuntarily recurs to something material, flowing out of some other thing that is material; and if we reject this idea of materiality, nothing is left of the emanation but an unreality. The word "thing" itself
suggests to us that which is material and within the cognizance and jurisdiction of the senses.
If we cut away from it the idea of materiality, it presents itself to us as no thing, but an intangible unreality, which the mind vainly endeavors to grasp. Existence and Being are terms that have the same
color of materiality; and when we speak of a Power or Force, the mind immediately images to itself one physical and material thing acting upon another. Eliminate that idea; and the Power or Force, devoid of

physical characteristics, seems as unreal as the shadow that dances on a wall, itself a mere absence of light; as spirit is to us merely that which is not matter.
Infinite space and infinite time are the two primary ideas. We formulize them thus: add body to body
and sphere to sphere, until the imagination wearies; and still there will remain beyond, avoid, empty, unoccupied SPACE, limitless, because it is void. Add event to event in continuous succession, forever
and forever, and there will still remain, before and after, a TIME in which there was and will be no event, and also endless because it too is void.
Thus these two ideas of the boundlessness of space and the endlessness of time seem to involve the
ideas that matter and events are limited and finite. We cannot conceive of an infinity of worlds or of events; but only of an indefinite number of each; for. as we struggle to conceive of their infinity, the
thought ever occurs in despite of all our efforts there must be space in which there are no worlds; there must have been time when there were no events.
We cannot conceive how, if this earth moves millions of millions of miles a million times repeated, it is
still in the centre of space; nor how, if we lived millions of millions of ages and centuries, we should still be in the centre of eternity with still as much space on one side as on the other; with still as much
time before us as behind; for that seems to say that the world has not moved nor we lived at all.
Nor can we comprehend how an infinite series of worlds, added together, is no larger than an infinite series of atoms; or an infinite series of centuries no longer than an infinite series of seconds; both being
alike infinite, and therefore one series containing no more nor fewer units than the other.
Nor have we the capacity to form in ourselves any idea of that which is immaterial. We use the word, but it conveys to us on1v the idea of the absence and negation of materiality; which vanishing, Space
and Time alone, infinite and boundless, seem to us to be left.
We cannot form any conception of an effect without a cause. We cannot but believe, indeed we know, that how far soever we may have to run back along the chain of effects and causes, it cannot be infinite;
but we must come at last to something which is not an effect, but the first cause: and vet the fact is literaltv beyond our comprehension. The mind refuses to grasp the idea of selfexistence, of existence
without a beginning. As well expect the hair that grows upon our head to understand the nature and immortality of the soul.
It does not need to go so far in search of mysteries; nor have we any right to disbelieve or doubt the
existence of a Great First Cause, itself no effect, because we cannot comprehend it; because the words

we use do not even express it to us adequately.
We rub a needle for a little while, on a dark, inert mass of iron ore, that had lain idle in the earth for many centuries. Something is thereby communicated to the steel we term it a virtue, a power, or a
quality and then we balance it upon a pivot; and, lo! drawn by some invisible, mysterious Power, one pole of the needle turns to the North, and there the same Power keeps the same pole for days and years;
will keep it there, perhaps, as long as the world lasts, carry the needle where you will, and no matter what seas or mountains intervene between it and the North Pole of the world. And this Power, thus
acting, and indicating to the mariner his course over the trackless ocean, when the stars shine not for many days, saves vessels from shipwreck, families from distress, and those from sudden death on
whose lives the fate of nations and the peace of the world depend. But for it, Napoleon might never have reached the ports of France on his return from Egypt, nor Nelson lived to fight and win at
Trafalgar. Men call this Power Magnetism, and then complacently think that they have explained it all; and yet they have but given a new name to an unknown thing, to hide their ignorance. What is this
wonderful Power? It is a real, actual, active Power that we know and see. But what its essence is, or how it acts, we do not know, any more than we know the essence or the mode of action of the Creative
Thought and Word of God.
And again, what is that which we term galvanism and electricity, which, evolved by the action of a little acid on two metals, aided by a magnet, circles the earth in a second, sending from land to land the
Thoughts that govern the transactions of individuals and nations? The mind has formed no notion of matter, that will include it; and no name that we can give it, helps us to understand its essence and its
being. It is a Power, like Thought and the Will. We know no more.
What is this power of gravitation that makes everything upon the earth tend to the centre? How does it reach out its invisible hands toward the erratic meteorstones, arrest them in their swift course, and draw
them down to the earth's bosom? It is a power. We know no more.
What is that heat which plays so wonderful a part in the world's economy, that caloric, latent everywhere, within us and without us, produced by combustion, by intense pressure, and by swift
motion? Is it substance, matter, spirit, or immaterial, a mere Force or State of Matter? And what is light? A substance, say the books, matter, that travels to us from the sun and stars, each ray separable
into seven, by the prism, of distinct colors, and with distinct peculiar qualities and actions. And if a substance, what is its essence, and what power is inherent in it, by which it journeys incalculable
myriads of miles, and reaches us ten thousand years or more after it leaves the stars?

which Enceladus or Typhon could not have risen asunder, and apply to it intense heat, and the vast power that couched latent in the water shivers the cylinder to atoms. A little shoot from a minute seed, a
shoot so soft and tender that the least bruise would kill it, forces its way downward into the hard, earth, to the depth of many feet, with an energy wholly incomprehensible. What are these mighty forces,
locked up in the small seed and the drop of water?
Nay, what is LIFE itself, with all its wondrous, mighty energies, that power which maintains the heat within us, and prevents our bodies, that decay so soon without it, from resolution into their original
elements Life, that constant miracle, the nature and essence whereof have eluded all the philosophers; and all their learned dissertations on it are a mere jargon of words?
No wonder the ancient Persians thought that Light and Life were one, both emanations from the
Supreme Deity, the archetype of light. No wonder that in their ignorance they worshipped the Sun. God breathed into man the spirit of life, not matter, but an emanation from Himself; not a creature made by
Him, nor a distinct existence, but a Power, like His own Thought; and light, to those greatsouled ancients, also seemed no creature, and no gross material substance, but a pure emanation from the
Deity, immortal and indestructible like Himself.
What, indeed, is REALITY? Our dreams are as real, while they last, as the occurrences of the daytime. We see, hear, feel, act, experience pleasure and suffer pain, as vividly and actually in a dream as when
awake. The occurrences and transactions of a year are crowded into the limits of a second: and the dream remembered is as real as the past occurrences of life.
The philosophers tell us that we have no cognizance of substance itself, but only of its attributes: that
when we see that which we call a block of marble, our perceptions give us information only of something extended, solid, colored, heavy, and the like; but not of the very thing itself, to which these
attributes belong. And yet the attributes do not exist without the substance.
They are not substances, but adjectives. There is no such thing or existence as hardness, weight or color, by itself, detached from any subject, moving first here, then there, and attaching itself to this and to the
other subject. And yet, they say, the attributes are not the subject.
So Thought, Volition, and Perception are not the soul, but its attributes; and we have no cognizance of the soul itself, but only of them, its manifestations. Nor of God; but only of His Wisdom, Power,
Magnificence, Truth, and other attributes.
And yet we know that there is matter, a soul within our body, a God that lives in the Universe. Take,

that I call ME, would still remain, complete, entire, identical as before. But I cannot ascertain, by the most intense and longcontinued reflection, what I am, nor where within my body I reside, nor whether
I am a point, or an expanded substance. I have no power to examine and inspect. I exist, will, think, perceive. That I know, and nothing more. I think a noble and sublime Thought. What is that Thought? It
is not Matter, nor Spirit. It is not a Thing; but a Power and Force. I make upon a paper certain conventional marks, that represent that Thought. There is no Power or Virtue in the marks I write, but
only in the Thought which they tell to others. I die, but the Thought still lives. It is a Power. It acts on men, excites them to enthusiasm, inspires patriotism, governs their conduct, controls their destinies,
disposes of life and death. The words I speak are but a certain succession of particular sounds, that by conventional arrangement communicate to others the Immaterial, Intangible, Eternal Thought. The fact
that Thought continues to exist an instant, after it makes its appearance in the soul, proves it immortal: for there is nothing conceivable that can destroy it. The spoken words, being mere sounds, may vanish
into thin air, and the written ones, mere marks, be burned, erased, destroyed but the THOUGHT itself lives still, and must live on forever.
A Human Thought, then, is an actual EXISTENCE, and a FORCE and POWER, capable of acting upon
and controlling matter as well as mind. Is not the existence of a God, who is the immaterial soul of the Universe, and whose THOUGHT, embodied or not embodied in His WORD, is an Infinite Power, of
Creation and production, destruction and preservation, quite as comprehensible as the existence of a Soul, of a Thought separated from the Soul, of the Power of that Thought to mould the fate and
influence the Destinies of Humanity?
And yet we know not when that Thought comes, nor what it is. It is not WE. We do not mould it, shape it, fashion it. It is neither our mechanism nor our invention. It appears spontaneously, flashing, as it
were, into the soul, making that soul the involuntary instrument of its utterance to the world. It comes to us, and seems a stranger to us, seeking a home.
As little can we explain the mighty power of the human WILL, Volition, like Thought, seems
spontaneous, an effect without a cause. Circumstances provoke it, and serve as its occasion, but do not produce it. It springs up in the soul, like Thought, as the waters gush upward in a spring. Is it the
manifestation of the soul, merely making apparent what passes within the soul, or an emanation from it, going abroad and acting outwardly, itself a real Existence, as it is an admitted Power? We can but own
our ignorance. It is certain that it acts on other souls, controls, directs them, shapes their action, legislates for men and nations and yet it is not material nor visible; and the laws it writes merely n one
soul of what has passed within another.
God, therefore, is a mystery, only as everything that surrounds us and as we ourselves, are mysteries.

We know that there is and must be a FIRST CAUSE. His attributes, severed from Himself, are unrealities. As color and extension, weight and hardness, do not exist apart from matter as separate
existences and substantives, spiritual or immaterial; so the Goodness, Wisdom, justice, Mercy, and Benevolence of God are not independent existences, personify them as men may, but attributes of the
Deity, the adjectives of One Great Substantive. But we know that He must be Good, True, Wise, Just, Benevolent, Merciful and in all these, and all His other attributes, Perfect and Infinite; because we are
conscious that these are laws imposed on us by the very nature of things, necessary, and without which the Universe would be confusion and the existence of a God incredible. They are of His essence, and
necessary, as His existence is.
[Estos], of Simon Magus, the He is the Living, Thinking, Intelligent SOUL of the Universe, the PERMANENT, the STATIONARY [ONE that always is [To To ON] of Plato, as contradistinguished
from the perpetual flux and reflux, or Genesis, of things.
And, as the Thought of the Soul, emanating from the Soul, becomes audible and visible in Words, so did THE THOUGHT OF GOD, springing up within Himself, immortal as Himself, when once
conceived, immortal before, because in Himself, utter Itself in THE WORD, its manifestation and mode of communication, and thus create the Material, Mental, Spiritual Universe, which, like Him, never
began to exist.
This is the real idea of the Ancient Nations GOD, the Almighty Father, and Source of All; His THOUGHT, conceiving the whole Universe, and willing its creation: His WORD, uttering that
THOUGHT, and thus becoming the Creator or Demiourgos, in the whom was Life and Light, and that Light the Life of the Universe.
Nor did that Word cease at the single act of Creation; and having set going the great machine, and
enacted the laws of its motion and progression, of birth and life, and change and death, cease to exist, or remain thereafter in inert idleness.
FOR THE THOUGHT OF GOD LIVES AND IS IMMORTAL. Embodied in the WORD, is not only
created, but it preserves. It conducts and controls the Universe, all spheres, all worlds, all actions of mankind, and of every animate and inanimate creature. It speaks in the soul of every man who lives.
The Stars, the Earth, the Trees, the Winds, the universal voice of Nature, tempest, and avalanche, the Sea's roar and the grave voice of the waterfall, the hoarse thunder and the low whisper of the brook, the
song of birds, the voice of love, the speech of men, all are the alphabet in which it communicates itself to men, and informs them of the will and law of God, the Soul of the Universe. And thus most truly did

[Ennoia], and the WORD [Logos], Manifestation and expression of the Thought. Behold THE TRUE MASONIC TRINITY; the UNIVERSAL SOUL, the THOUGHT in the Soul, the WORD, or Thought
expressed; the THREE TN ONE, of a Trinitarian Ecossais.
Here Masonry pauses, and leaves its Initiates to carry out and develop these great Truths in such manner as to each may seem most accordant with reason, philosophy, truth, and his religious faith. It
declines to act as Arbiter between them. It looks calmly on, while each multiplies the intermediates between the Deity and Matter, and the personifications of God's manifestations and attributes, to
whatever extent his reason, his conviction, or his fancy dictates.
While the Indian tells us that PARABRAHMA, BRAHM, and PARATMA were the first Triune God, revealing Himself as BRAHMA, VISHNU, and SIVA, Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer; The Egyptian,
of AMUNRE, NEITH, and PHTHA, Creator, Matter, Thought or Light; the Persian of his Trinity of Three Powers in ORMUZD, Sources of Light, Fire, and Water; the Buddhists of the God SAKYA, a
Trinity composed of BUDDHA, DHARM and SANGA, Intelligence, Law, and Union or Harmony; the Chinese Sabeans of their Trinity of Changti, the Supreme Sovereign; Tien, the Heavens; and Tao, the
Universal Supreme Reason and Principle of all things; who produced the Unit; that, two; two, three; and three, all that is. While the SclavonoVend typifies his Trinity by the three heads of the God
Triglav; the Ancient Prussian points to his Triune God, Perkoun, Pikollos, and Potrimpos, Deities of Light and Thunder, of Hell and of the Earth; the Ancient Scandinavian to Odin, Frea, and Thor; and the
old Etruscans to TINA, TALNA, and MINIMVA, Strength, Abundance, and Wisdom; While Plato tells us of the Supreme Good, the Reason or Intellect, and the], and the Soul or Spirit; and Philo of the
Archetype of Light, Wisdom [is the Kabalists, of the Triads of the Sephiroth Word] while the disciples of Simon Magus, and the many sects of the Gnostics, confuse us with their Eons, Emanations, Powers,
Wisdom Superior and Inferior, Ialdabaoth, AdamKadmon, even to the three hundred and sixtyfive thousand emanations of the Maldaites. And while the pious Christian believes that the WORD dwelt in
the Mortal Body of Jesus of Nazareth, and suffered upon the Cross; and that the HOLY GHOST was poured out upon the Apostles, and now inspires every truly Christian Soul.
While all these faiths assert their claims to the exclusive possession of the Truth, Masonry inculcates its
old doctrine, and no more. That God is ONE; that His THOUGHT uttered in His WORD, created the Universe, and preserves it by those Eternal Laws which are the expression of that Thought: that the
Soul of Man, breathed into him by God, is immortal as His Thoughts are; that he is free to do evil or to choose good, responsible for his acts and punishable for his sins: that all evil and wrong and suffering
are but temporary, the discords of one great Harmony, and that in His good time they will lead by infinite modulations to the great, harmonic final chord and cadence of Truth, Love, Peace, and
Happiness, that will ring forever and ever under the Arches of Heaven, among all the Stars and Worlds, and in all souls of men and Angels.

XXVII. KNIGHT COMMANDER OF THE EMPIRE
THIS is the first of the really Chivalric Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. It occupies
this place in the Calendar of the Degrees between the 26th and the last of the Philosophical Degrees, in order, by breaking the continuity of these, to relieve what might
otherwise become wearisome; and also to remind that, while engaged with the speculations and abstractions of philosophy and creeds, the Mason is also to continue engaged in active duties of this
great warfare of life.
He is not only a Moralist and Philosopher, but a Soldier, the Successor of those Knights of the Middle Age, who, while they wore the Cross, also wielded the Sword, and were the Soldiers of Honor, Loyalty,
and Duty.
Times change, and circumstances; but Virtue and Duty remain the same. The Evils to be warred against but take another shape and are developed in a different form.
There is the same need now of truth and loyalty as in the days of Frederic Barbarossa.
The characters, religious and military, attention to the sick and wounded in the Hospital, and war
against the Infidel in the field are no longer blended; but the same duties, to be performed in another shape, continue to exist and to environ us all.
The innocent virgin is no longer at the mercy of the brutal Baron or licentious manatarms; but purity
and innocence still need protectors.
War is no longer the apparently natural State of Society; and for most men it is an empty obligation to assume, that they will not recede before the enemy; but the same high duty and obligation still rest upon
all men.
Truth, in act, profession, and opinion, is rarer now than in days of chivalry. Falsehood has become a current coin, and circulates with a certain degree of respectability; because it has an actual value. It is
indeed the great Vice of the Age it, and its twinsister, Dishonesty.
Men, for political preferment, profess whatever principles are expedient and profitable. At the bar, in

the pulpit, and in the halls of legislation, men argue against their own convictions, and, with what they term logic, prove to the satisfaction of others that which they do not themselves believe. Insincerity and
duplicity are valuable to their possessors, like estates in stocks, that yield a certain revenue and it is no longer the truth of an opinion or a principle, but the net profit
that may be realized from it, which is the measure of its value.
The Press is the great sower of falsehood. To slander a political antagonist, to misrepresent all that he says, and, if that be impossible, to invent for him what he does not say; to put in circulation whatever
baseless calumnies against him are necessary to defeat him, these are habits so common as to have ceased to notice or comment, much less surprise or disgust.
There was a time when a Knight would die rather than utter a lie or break his Knightly word. The
Knight Commander of the Temple revives the old Knightly spirit; and devotes himself to the Knightly worship of Truth. No profession of an opinion not his own, for expediency's sake or profit, or through
fear of the world's disfavor; no slander of even an enemy; no coloring or perversion of the sayings or acts of other men; no insincere speech and argument for any purpose, or under any pretext, must soil his
fair escutcheon. Out of the Chapter, as well as in it, he must speak the Truth, and all the Truth, no more and no less; or else speak not at all.
To purity and innocence everywhere, the Knight Commander owes protection, as of old; against bold
violence, or those, more guilty than murderers, who by art and treachery seek to slay the soul; and against that want and destitution that drive too many to sell their honor and innocence for food.
In no age of the world has man had better opportunity than now to display those lofty virtues and that
noble heroism that so distinguished the three great military and religious Orders, in their youth, before they became corrupt and vitiated by prosperity and power.
When a fearful epidemic ravages a city, and death is inhaled with the air men breathe; when the living
scarcely suffice to bury the dead most men flee in abject terror, to return and live, respectable and influential, when the danger has passed away. But the old Knightly spirit of devotion and
disinterestedness and contempt of death still lives, and is not extinct in the human heart. Everywhere a few are found to stand firmly and unflinchingly at their posts, to front and defy the danger, not for
money, or to be honored for it, or to protect their own household; but from mere humanity, and to obey the unerring dictates of duty. They nurse the sick, breathing the pestilential atmosphere of the hospital.
They explore the abodes of want and misery. With the gentlenes of woman, they soften the pains of the dying, and feed the lamp of life in the convalescent. They perform the last sad offices the dead; and
they seek no other reward than the approval their own consciences.

These are the true Knights of the present age these, and captain who remains at his post on board his shattered ship un the last boat, loaded to the water's edge with passengers and crew, has parted from her
side; and then goes calmly down with her into the mysterious depths of the ocean; the pilot who stands at the wheel while the swift flames eddy round him and scorch away his life; the fireman who ascends
the blazing walls, and plunges amid the flames to save the property or lives of those who have upon him no claim by tie of blood, or friendship, or even of ordinary acquaintance; these, and others like
these; all men, who, set at the post of duty, stand there manfully; to die, if need be, but not to desert their post for these, too, are sworn not to recede before the enemy.
To the performance of duties and of acts of heroism like these, you have devoted yourself, my Brother,
by becoming a Knight Commander of the Temple. Soldier of the Truth and of Loyalty! Protector of Purity and Innocence! Defier of Plague and Pestilence! Nurser of the Sick and Burier of the Dead!
Knight, preferring Death to abandonment of the Post of Duty! Welcome the bosom of this Order!
XXVIII. KNIGHT OF THE SUN OR PRINCE ADEPT
GOD is the author of everything that existeth; the Eternal, the Supreme, the Living, and Awful Being;
from Whom nothing in he Universe is hidden.
Make of Him no idols and visible images; but rather worship Him in the deep solitudes of sequestered forests; for He is invisible, and fills the Universe as its soul, and liveth not in any Temple
Light and Darkness are the World's Eternal ways. God is the principle of everything that exists, and the
Father of all Beings. He is eternal, immovable, and SelfExistent. There are no bounds to His power. At one glance He sees the Past, the Present, and the Future; and the procession of the builders of the
Pyramids, with us and our remotest Descendants, is now passing before Him. He reads our thoughts before they are known to ourselves. He rules the movements of the Universe, and all events and
revolutions are the creatures of His will. For He is the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligence.
In the beginning Man had the WORD, and that WORD was from God and out of the living power which, in and by that WORD, as communicated to man, came the LIGHT of his existence. Let no man
speak the WORD, for by it THE FATHER made light and darkness, the world and living creatures!
The Chaldean upon his plains worshipped me, and the sealoving Phoenician. They builded me temples and towers, and burned sacrifices to me upon a thousand altars. Light was divine to them, and they

thought me a God. But I am nothingnothing and LIGHT is the creature of the unseen GOD that taught the true religion to the Ancient Patriarchs AWFUL, MYSTERIOUS, THE ABSOLUTE.
Man was created pure; and God gave him TRUTH, as He gave him LIGHT. He has lost the truth and
found error. He wandered far into darkness; and round him Sin and Shame hover evermore. The Soul that is impure, and sinful, and defiled with earthly stains, cannot again unite with God, until, by long
trials and many purifications, it is finally delivered from the old clamity; and Light overcomes Darkness and dethrones it, in the Soul.
God is the First; indestructible, eternal, UNCREATED, INVISIBLE. Wisdom, Justice, Truth, and
Mercy, with Harmony and a Love, are of His essence, and Eternity and Infinite of Extension. He is silent, and consents with MIND, and is known to Souls through MIND alone. In Him were all things
originally contained, and from Him all things were evolved. For out of His Divine SILENCE and REST, after an infinitude of time, was unfolded the WORD, or the Divine Power and then in turn the
Mighty, everacting, measureless INTELLECT; and from the WORD were evolved the myriads of suns and systems that make the Universe; and fire, and light, and the electric HARMONY, which is the
harmony of spheres and numbers and from the INTELLECT all Souls and intellects of men.
In the beginning, the Universe was but ONE SOUL. HE was THE ALL, alone with TIME and SPACE, and Infinite as they.
HE HAD THIS THOUGHT: "I Create Worlds:" and lo! the Universe, and the laws of harmony and
motion that rule it, the expression of a thought of God; and bird and beast, and every living thing but Man and light and air, and the mysterious currents, and the dominion of mysterious numbers!
HE HAD THIS THOUGHT: "I Create Man, whose Soul shall be my image, and he shall rule." And
lo! Man, with senses, instinct, and a reasoning mind!
And yet not MAN! but an animal that breathed, and saw, and thought until an immaterial spark from God's own Infinite Being penetrated the brain, and became the Soul and lo, MAN THE IMMORTAL!
Thus, threefold, fruit of God's thought, is Man; that sees and hears and feels; that thinks and reasons; that loves and is in harmony with the Universe.
Before the world grew old, the primitive truth faded out from men's Souls. Then man asked himself,
"What am I? and how and whence am I? and whither do I go?" And the Soul, looking inward upon itself, strove to learn whether that "I" were mere matter; its thought and reason and its passions and
affections mere results of material combination; or a material Being enveloping an immaterial Spirit

417/641
and further it strove, by selfexamination, to learn whether that Spirit were an individual essence, with a separate immortal existence, or an infinitesimal portion of a Great First Principle, interpenetrating the
Universe and the infinitude of space, and undulating like light and heat and so they wandered further amid the mazes of error; and imagined vain philosophies; wallowing in the sloughs of materialism and
sensualism, of beating their wings vainly in the vacuum of abstractions and idealities.
While yet the first oaks still put forth their leaves, man lost the perfect knowledge of the One True God, the Ancient Absolute Existence, the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligence; and floated helplessly out
upon the shoreless ocean of conjecture. Then the soul vexed itself with seeking to learn whether the material universe was a mere chance combination of atoms, or the work of Infinite, Uncreated Wisdom
whether the Deity was a concentrated, and the Universe an extended immateriality; or whether He was a personal existence, an Omnipotent, Eternal, Supreme Essence, regulating matter at will; or subjecting
it to unchangeable laws throughout eternity; and to Whom, Himself Infinite and Eternal, Space and Time are unknown. With their finite limited vision they sought to learn the source and explain the
existence of Evil, and Pain, and Sorrow; and so they wandered ever deeper into the darkness, and were lost; and there was for them no longer any God; but only a great, dumb, soulless Universe, full of mere
emblems and symbols.
You have heretofore, in some of the Degrees through which you have passed, heard much of the ancient worship of the Sun, the Moon, and the other bright luminaries of Heaven, and of the Elements and
Powers of Universal Nature. You have been made, to some extent, familiar with their personifications as Heroes suffering or triumphant, or as personal Gods or Goddesses, with human. characteristics and
passions, and with the multitude of legends, and fables that do but allegorically represent their risings and settings, their courses, their conjunctions and oppositions, their domiciles and places of exaltation.
Perhaps you have supposed that we, like many who have written on these subjects, have intended to
represent this worship to you as the most ancient and original worship of the first men that lived. To undeceive you, if such was your conclusion, we have caused the Personifications of the Great Luminary
of Heaven, under the names by which he was known to the most ancient nations, to proclaim the old primitive truths that were known to the Fathers of our race, before men came to worship the visible
manifestations of the Supreme Power and Magnificence and Supposed Attributes of the Universal Deity in the Elements and in the glittering armies that Night regularly marshals and arrays upon the blue field
of the firmament.
We ask now your attention to a still further development to these truths, after we shall have added something to what we have already said in regard to the Chief Luminary of Heaven, in explanation of
the names and characteristics of the several imaginary Deities that represented him among the ancient races men.

ATHOM or ATHOMRE, was the Chief and Oldest Supreme God of Upper Egypt, worshipped at Thebes; the same as the OM or AUM of the Hindus, whose name was unpronounceable, and who like
the BREHM of the latter People, was "The Being that was and is, and is to come; the Great God, the Great Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnipresent One, the Greatest in the Universe, the Lord;" whose
emblem was a perfect sphere, showing that He was first, last, midst, and without end; superior to all Natural Gods, and all personifications of Powers, Elements, and Luminaries; symbolized by Light, the
Principle of Life.
AMUN was the NatureGod, or Spirit of Nature, called by that name or AMUNRE, and worshipped at Memphis in Lower Egypt and in Libya, as well as in Upper Egypt. He was the Libyan Jupiter, and
represented the intelligent and organizing force that develops itself in Nature, when the intellectual types or forms of bodies are revealed to the senses in the world's order, by their union with matter,
whereby the generation of bodies is effected. He was the same with Knephl, from whose mouth issued the Orphic egg out of which came the Universe.
DIONUSOS was the NatureGod of the Greeks, as AMUN was of the Egyptians. In the popular legend,
Dionusos, as well as Hercules, was a Theban Hero, born of a mortal mother. Both were sons of Zeus, both persecuted by Here. But in Hercules the God is subordinate to the Hero; while Dionusos, even in
poetry, retains his divine character, and is identical with Iacchus, the presiding genius of the Mysteries. Personification of the Sun in Taurus, as his oxhoofs showed, he delivered earth from the harsh
dominion of winter, conducted the mighty chorus of the Stars, and the celestial revolution of the year, changed with the seasons, and underwent their periodical decay. He was the Sun as invoked by the
Eleans, ushered into the world amidst lightning and thunder, the Mighty Hunter of the Zodiac, Zagreus the Golden or ruddyfaced. The Mysteries taught the doctrine of Divine Unity; and that Power whose
Oneness is a seeming mystery, but really a truism, was Dionusos, the God of Nature, or of that moisture, which is the life of Nature, who prepares in darkness, in Hades or Iasion, the return of life and
vegetation, or is himself the light and change evolving their varieties. In the Egean Islands he was Butes, Dardanus, Himeros or Imbros; in Crete he appears as or even Zeus, whose orgiastic worship,
remaining unveiled by the usual forms of mystery, betrayed to profane curiosity the symbols which, if irreverently contemplated, were sure to be misunderstood.
He was the same with the dismembered Zagreus, the son of Persephone, an Ancient Subterranean
Dionusos, the horned progeny of Zeus in the Constellation of the Serpent, entrusted by his father with the thunderbolt, and encircled with the protecting dance of Curetes. Through the envious artifices of
Here, the Titans eluded the vigilance of his guardians and tore him to pieces; but Pallas restored the still palpitating heart to his father, who commanded Apollo to bury the dismembered remains upon
Parnassus.
Dionusos, as well as Apollo, was leader of the Muses; the tomb of one accompanied the worship of the

419/641
other; they were the same, yet different, contrasted, yet only as filling separate parts in the same drama; and the mystic and heroic personifications, the God of nature and of Art, seem, at some remote period,
to have proceeded from a common source. Their separation was one of form rather than of substance: and from the time when Hercules obtained initiation from Triptolemus, or Pythagoras received Orphic
tenets, the two conceptions were tending to recombine. It was said that Dionusos or Poseidon had preceded Apollo in the Oracular office; and Dionusos continued to be esteemed in Greek Theology as
Healer and Saviour, Author of Life and Immortality. The dispersed Pythagoreans, "Sons of Apollo," immediately betook themselves to the Orphic Service of Dionusos, and there are indications that there
was always something Dionysiac in the worship of Apollo.
Dionusos is the Sun, that liberator of the elements; and his spiritual meditation was suggested by the same imagery which made the Zodiac the supposed path of the Spirits in their descent and their return.
His second birth, as offspring of the highest, is a type of the spiritual regeneration of man. He, as well as Apollo was precentor of the Muses and source of inspiration. His rule prescribed no unnatural
mortification; its yoke was easy, and its mirthful choruses, combining the gay with the severe, did but commemorate that golden age when earth enjoyed eternal spring, and when fountains of honey, milk,
and wine burst forth out of its bosom at the touch of the thyrsus. He is the "Liberator." Like Osiris, he frees the soul, and guides it in its migrations beyond the grave, preserving it from the risk of again
falling under the slavery of matter or of some inferior animal form. All soul part of the Universal Soul, whose totality is Dionusos; and he leads back the vagrant spirit to its home, and accompanies it through
the purifying processes, both real and symbolical of earthly transit. He died and descended to the Shades; and his suffering was the great secret of the Mysteries, as death is grand mystery of existence.
He is the immortal suitor of Psyche (the Soul), the Divine influence which physically called the world into being, and which, awakening the soul from its Stygian trance, restores it from earth to Heaven.
Of HERMES, the Mercury of the Greeks, the Thoth of Egyptians, and the Taaut of the Phoenicians, we
have heretofore spoken sufficiently at length. He was the inventor of letters and of Oratory, the winged messenger of the Gods, bearing the Caduceus wreathed with serpents; and in our Council he is
represented by the ORATOR.
The Hindus called the Sun SURYA; the Persians, MITHRAS; the Egyptians, OSIRIS; the Assyrians and Chaldaeans, BEL; the Scythians and Etruscans and the ancient Pelasgi, ARKALEUS or
HERCULES; the Phoenicians, ADONAI or ADON; and the Scandinavians, ODIN.
From the name SURYA, given by the Hindus to the Sun, the Sect who paid him particular adoration were called Souras. Their painters describe his car as drawn by seven green horses. In the Temple of
Visweswara, at Benares, there is an ancient piece of sculpture, well executed in stone, representing him sitting in a car drawn by a horse with twelve heads. His charioteer, by whom he is preceded, is ARUN
[from AUR the Crepusculum?], or the Dawn; and among his many titles are twelve that denote his

distinct powers in each of the twelve months. Those powers are called Adityas, each of whom has a particular name. Surya is supposed frequently to have descended upon earth, in a human shape, and to
have left a race on earth, equally renowned in Indian story with the Heliades of Greece. He is often styled King of the Stars and Planets, and thus reminds us of the AdonTsbauth (Lord of the Starry
Hosts) of the Hebrew writings.
MITHRAS was the SunGod of the Persians; and was fabled to have been born in a grotto or cave, at the Winter Solstice. His feasts were celebrated at that period, at the moment when the sun commenced
to return Northward, and to increase the length of the days. This was the great Feast of the Magian religion. The Roman Calendar, published in the time of Constantine, at which period his worship began
to gain ground in the Occident, fixed his feastday on the 25th of December. His statues and images were inscribed, DeoSoli invicto Mithrae to the invincible SunGod Mithras. Nomen invictum Sol
Mithra. Soli Omnipotenti Mithrae. To him, gold, incense, and myrrh were consecrated. "Thee," says Martianus Capella, in his hymn to the Sun, "the dwellers on the Nile adore as Serapis, and Memphis
worships as Osiris; in the sacred rites of Persia thou art Mithras, in Phrygia, Atys, and Libya bows down to thee as Ammon, and Phoenician Byblos as Adonis; and thus the whole world adores thee under
different names."
OSIRIS was the son of Helios (Phra), the "divine offspring congenerate with the dawn," and at the same time an incarnation of Kneph or Agathodaemon, the Good Spirit, including all his possible
manifestations, either physical or moral. He represented in a familiar form the beneficent aspect of all higher emanations and in him was developed the conception of a Being purely good, so that it became
necessary to set up another power as his adversary called Seth, Babys or Typhon, to account for the injurious influences of Nature.
With the phenomena of agriculture, supposed to be the invention of Osiris, the Egyptians connected the
highest truths of the religion. The soul of man was as the seed hidden in the ground and the mortal framework, similarly consigned to its dark resting place, awaited its restoration to life's unfailing source.
Osiris was not only benefactor of the living; he was also Hades, Serapis, and Rhadamanthus, the monarch of the dead. Death, therefore, in Egyptian opinion, was only another name for renovation,
since its God is the same power who incessantly renews vitality in Nature.
Every corpse duly embalmed was called "Osiris," and in the grave was supposed to be united, or at least brought into approximation to the Divinity. For when God became incarnate for man's benefit, it was
implied that, in analogy with His assumed character He should submit to all the conditions of visible existence. In death, as in life, Isis and Osiris were patterns and precursors of mankind; their sepulchres
stood within the temples of the Superior Gods; yet though their remains might be entombed at Memphis or Abydus, their divinity was unimpeached, and they either shone as luminaries in the
heavens, or in the unseen world presided over the futurity of the disembodied spirits whom death had

brought nearer to them.
The notion of a dying God, so frequent in Oriental legend, and of which we have already said much in former Degrees, was the natural inference from a literal interpretation of nature worship; since nature,
which in the vicissitudes of the seasons seems to undergo a dissolution, was to the earliest religionists the express image of the Deity, and at a remote period one and the same with the "varied God," whose
attributes were seen not only in its vitality, but in its changes. The unseen Mover of the Universe was rashly identified with its obvious fluctuations. The speculative Deity suggested by the drama of nature,
was worshipped with imitative and sympathetic rites. A period of mourning about the Autumnal Equinox, and of joy at the return of Spring, was almost universal.
Phrygians and Paphlagonians, Boeotians, and even Athenians, were all more or less attached to such
observances; the Syrian damsels sat weeping for Thammuz or Adoni, mortally wounded by the tooth of Winter, symbolized by the boar, its very general emblem: and these rites, and those of Atys and Osiris,
were evidently suggested by the arrest of vegetation, when the Sun, descending from his altitude, seems deprived of his generating power.
Osiris is a being analogous to the Syrian ADONI; and the fable of his history, which we need not here
repeat, is a narrative form of the popular religion of Egypt, of which the Sun is the Hero, and the agricultural calendar the moral. The moist valley of the Nile, owing its fertility to the annual
inundation, appeared, in contrast with the surrounding desert, like life in the midst of death. The inundation was in evident dependence on the Sun, and Egypt, environed with arid deserts, like a heart
within a burning censer, was the female power, dependent on the influences personified in its God. Typhon his brother, the type of darkness, drought, and sterility, threw his body into the Nile; and thus
Osiris, the "good," the "Saviour," perished, in the 28th year of his life or reign, and on the 17th day of the month Athor, or the 13th of November. He is also made to die during the heats of the early Summer,
when, from March to July, the earth was parched with intolerable heat, vegetation was scorched, and the languid Nile exhausted. From that death he rises when the Solstitial Sun brings the inundation, and
Egypt is filled with mirth and acclamation anticipatory of the second harvest. From his Wintry death he rises with the early flowers of Spring, and then the joyful festival of Osiris found was celebrated.
So the pride of Jemsheed, one of the Persian Sunheroes, or the solar year personified, was abruptly cut
off by Zohak, the tyrant of the West. He was sawn asunder by a fishbone, and immediately the brightness of Iran changed to gloom. Ganymede and Adonis, like Osiris, were hurried off in all their
strength and beauty; the premature death of Linus, the burthen of the ancient lament of Greece, was like that of the Persian Siamek, the Bithynian Hylas, and the Egyptian Maneros, Son of Menes or the
Eternal.

The elegy called Maneros was sung at Egyptian banquets, and an effigy enclosed within a diminutive Sarcophagus was handed round to remind the guests of their brief tenure of existence. The beautiful
Memnon, also, perished in his prime; and Enoch, whose early death was lamented at Iconium, lived 365 years, the number of days of the solar year; a brief space when compared with the longevity of his
patriarchal kindred.
The story of Osiris is reflected in those of Orpheus and Dionusos Zagreus, and perhaps in the legends of Absyrtus and Pelias of AEson, Thyestes, Melicertes, Itys, and Pelops. Io is the disconsolate Isis or
Niobe: and Rhea mourns her dismembered Lord, Hyperion, and the death of her son Helios, drowned in the Eridanus; and if Apollo and Dionusos are immortal, they had died under other names, as
Orpheus, Linus, or Hyacinthus. The sepulchre of Zeus was shown in Crete. Hippolytus was associated in divine honours with Apollo, and after he had been torn to piece like Osiris, was restored to life by the
Paeonian herbs of Diana, and kept darkling in the secret grove of Egeria. Zeus deserted Olympus to visit the Ethiopians; Apollo underwent servitude to Admetus; Theseus, Peirithous, Hercules, and other
heroes, descended for a time to Hades; a dying NatureGod was exhibited in the Mysteries, the Attic women fasted, sitting on the ground, during the Thesmophoria, and the Boeotians lamented the descent
of CoraProserpine to the Shades.
But the death of the Deity, as understood by the Orientals, was not inconsistent with His immortality. The temporary decline of the Sons of Light is but an episode in their endless continuity and as the day
and year are more convenient subdivisions of the Infinite, so the fiery deaths of Phaethon or Hercules are but breaks in the same Phoenix process of perpetual regeneration, by which the spirit of Osiris lives
forever in the succession of the Memphia Apis. Every year witnesses the revival of Adonis; and the amber tears shed by the Heliades for the premature death of their brother, are the golden shower full of
prolific hope, in which Zeus descends from the brazen vault of Heaven into the bosom of the parched ground.
BAL, representative or personification of the sun, was one of the Great Gods of Syria, Assyria, and
Chaldea, and his name is found upon the monuments of Nimroud, and frequently occurs in the Hebrew writings. He was the Great NatureGod of Babylonia, the Power of heat, life, and generation. His
symbol was the Sun, and he was figured seated on a bull.
All the accessories of his great temple at Babylon, described by Herodotus, are repeated with singular fidelity, but on a smaller scale, in the Hebrew tabernacle and temple. The golden statue alone is wanted
to complete the resemblance. The word Bal or Baal, like the word Adon, signifies Lord and Master. He was also the Supreme Deity of the Moabites, Amonites, and Carthaginians, and of the Sabeans in
general; the Gauls worshipped the Sun under the name of Belin or Belinus: and Bela is found among the Celtic Deities upon the ancient monuments.

The Northern ancestors of the Greeks maintained with hardier habits a more manly style of religious symbolism than the effeminate enthusiasts of the South, and had embodied in their Perseus,
HERCULES and MITHRAS, the consummation of the qualities they esteemed and exercised.
Almost every nation will be found to have had a mythical being, whose strength or weakness, virtues or defects, more or less nearly describe the Sun's career through the seasons. There was a Celtic, a
Teutonic, a Scythian, an Etruscan, a Lydian Hercules, all whose legends became tributary to those of the Greek hero. The name of Hercules was found by Herodotus to have been long familiar in Egypt and
the East, and to have originally belonged to a much higher personage than the comparatively modern hero known in Greece as the Son of Alcmena. The temple of the Hercules of Tye was reported to have
been built 2300 years before the time of Herodotus; and Hercules, whose Greek name has been sometimes supposed to be of Phoenician origin, in the sense of Circuitor i.e. "rover" and
"perambulator" of earth, as well as "Hyperion of the sky, was the patron and model of those famous navigators who spread his altars from coast to coast through the Mediterranean, to the extremities of the
West, where "ARKALEUS" built the City of Gades, and where a perpetual fire burned in his service. He was the lineal descendant of Perseus, the luminous child of darkness, conceived within a
subterranean vault of brass; and he a representation of the Persian Mithras, rearing his emblematic lions above the gates of Mycenae, and bringing the sword of Jemsheed to battle against the Gorgons of the
West. Mithras is similarly described in the ZendAvesta as the "mighty hero, the rapid runner, whose piercing eye embraces all, whose arm bears the club for the destruction of the Darood."
Hercules Ingeniculus, who, bending on one knee, uplifts his club and tramples on the Serpent's head,
was, like Prometheus and Tantalus, one of the varying aspects of the struggling and declining Sun. The victories of Hercules are but exhibitions of Solar power which have ever to be repeated. It was in the
fial North, among the Hyperboreans, that, divested of his Lion's skin, he lay down to sleep, and for a time lost the horses of his chariot. Henceforth that Northern region of gloom, called the "place of the
death and revival of Adonis," that Caucasus whose summit was so lofty, that, like the Indian Meru, it seemed to be both the goal and commencement of the Sun's career, became to Greek imaginations the
final bourne of all things, the abode of Winter and desolation, the pinnacle of the arch connecting the upper and lower world, and consequently the appropriate place for the banishment of Prometheus. The
daughters of Israel, weeping for Thammuz, mentioned by Ezekiel, sat looking to the North, waiting for his return from that region. It was while Cybele with the SunGod was absent among the Hyperboreans,
that Phrygia, abandoned by her, suffered the horrors of famine. Delos and Delphi awaited the return of Apollo from the Hyperboreans, and Hercules brought thence to Olympia the olive. To all Masons the
North has immemorially been the place of darkness; and of the great lights of the Lodge, none is in the North.
Mithras, the rockborn hero heralded the Sun's return in Spring, as Prometheus, chained in his cavern.
betokened the continuance of Winter. The Persian beacon on the mountaintop represented the Rock born Divinity enshrined in his worthiest temple; and the funeral conflagration of Hercules was the sun

dying in glory behind the Western hills. But though the transitory manifestation suffers or dies, the abiding and eternal power liberates and saves. It was an essential attribute of a Titan, that he should
arise again after his fall; for the revival of Nature is as certain as its decline, and its alternations are subject to the appointment of a power which controls them both.
"God," says Maximus Tyrius, "did not spare His own Son [Hercules], or exempt Him from the
calamities incidental to humanity. The Theban progeny of Jove had his share of pain and trial. By vanquishing earthly difficulties he proved his affinity with Heaven. His life was a continuous struggle.
He fainted before Typhon in the desert; and in the commencement of the Autumnal season (cum longae redit hora noctis), descended under the guidance of Minerva to Hades. He died; but first applied for
initiation to Eumolpus, in order to foreshadow that state of religious preparation which should precede the momentous change. Even in Hades he rescued Theseus and removed the stone of Ascalapllus,
reanimated the bloodless spirits, and dragged into the light of clay the monster Cerberus, justly reputed invincible because an emblem of Time itself; he burst the chains of the grave (for Busiris is the grave
personified), and triumphant at the close as in the dawn of his career, was received after his labours into the repose of the heavenly mansions, living forever with Zeus in the arms of Eternal Youth.
ODIN is said to have borne twelve names among the old Germans, and to have had 114 names besides.
He was the Apollo of the Scandinavians, and is represented in the Voluspa as destined to slay the monstrous snake. Then the Sun will be extinguished, the earth be dissolved in the ocean, the stars lose
their brightness, and all Nature be destroyed in order that it may be renewed again. From the bosom of the waters a new world will emerge clad in verdure; harvests will be seen to ripen where no seed was
sown, and evil will disappear.
The free fancy of the ancients, which wove the web of their myths and legends, was consecrated by faith. It had not, like the modern mind, set apart a petty sanctuary of borrowed beliefs, beyond which all
the rest was common and unclean. Imagination, reason, and religion circled round the same symbol; and in all their symbols there was serious meaning, if we could but find it out. They did not devise
fictions in the same vapid spirit in which we, cramped by conventionalities, read them. In endeavouring to interpret creations of fancy, fancy as well as reason must guide and much of modern controversy
arises out of heavy misapprehensions of ancient symbolism.
To those ancient peoples, this earth was the centre of the Universe. To them there were no other worlds, peopled with living beings, to divide the care and attention of the Deity. To them the world was a great
plain, of unknown, perhaps inconceivable limits, and the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars journeyed above it, to give them light. The worship of the Sun became the basis of all the religions of antiquity. To them
light and heat were mysteries; as indeed they still are to us. As the Sun caused the day, and his absence the night; as, when he journeyed Northward, Spring and Summer followed him; and when he again
turned to the South, Autumn and inclement Winter, and cold and long dark nights ruled the earth; as his

influence produced the leaves and flowers, and ripened the harvests, and brought regular inundation, he necessarily became to them the most interesting object of the material Universe. To them he was the
innate fire of Holies, the fire of nature. Author of Life, heat, and ignition, he was to them, the efficient cause of all generation, for without him there was no movement, no existence, no form. He was to them
immense, indivisible, imperishable, and everywhere present. It was their need of light, and of his creative energy, that was felt by all men; and nothing was more fearful to them than his absence. His
beneficent influences caused his identification with the Principle of Good; and the BRAHMA of the Hindus, the MITHRAS of the Persians, and ATHOM, AMUN, PHTHA, and OSIRIS, of the Egyptians,
the BEL, of the Chaldeans, the ADONAI of the Phoenicians, the ADONIS and APOLLO of the Greeks became but personifications of the Sun, the regenerating Principle, image of that fecundity which
perpetuates and rejuvenates the world's existence.
So too the struggle between the Good and Evil Principles was personified, as was that between life and death, destruction and recreation; in allegories and fables which poetically represented the apparent
course of the Sun; who, descending toward the Southern Hemisphere, was figuratively said to be conquered and put to death by darkness, or the genius of Evil; but returning again toward the Northern
Hemisphere, he seemed to be victorious, and to arise from the tomb. This death and resurrection were also figurative of the succession of day and night, of death, which is a necessity of life, and of life
which is born of and everywhere the ancients still saw the combat between the two Principles that ruled the world. Everywhere this contest was embodied in allegories and fictitious histories into which were
ingeniously woven all the astronomical phenomena that accompanied, preceded, or followed the different movements of the Sun, and the changes of Seasons, the approach or withdrawal of inundation.
And thus grew into stature and strange proportions the histories of the contests between Typhon and Osiris, Hercules and Juno, the Titans and Jupiter, Ormuzd and Ahriman, the rebellious Angels and the
Deity, the Evil Genii and the Good; and the other like fables, found not only in Asia, but in the North of Europe, and even among the Mexicans and Peruvians of the New World; carried thither, in all
probability, by those Phoenician voyagers who bore thither civilization and the arts. The Scythians lamented the death of Acmon, the Persians that of Zohak conquered by Pheridoun, the Hindus that of
SouraParama slain by SoupraMuni, as the Scandinavians did that of Balder, torn to pieces by the blind Hother.
The primitive idea of infinite space existed in the first men, as it exists in us. It and the idea of infinite
time are the first two innate ideas. Man cannot conceive how thing can be added to thing, or event follow event, forever. The idea will ever return, that no matter how long bulk is added to bulk, there
must be, still beyond, an empty void without limit; in which is nothing. In the same way the idea of time without beginning or end forces itself on him. Time, without events, is also a void, and nothing.
In that empty void space the primitive men knew there was no light nor warmth. They felt, what we
know scientifically, that there must be a thick darkness there, and an intensity of cold of which we have no conception. Into that void they thought the Sun, the Planets, and the Stars went down when they set

under the Western Horizon. Darkness was to them an enemy, a harm, a vague dread and terror. It was the very embodiment of the evil principle; and out of it they said that he was formed. As the Sun bent
Southward toward that void, they shuddered with dread and when, at the Winter Solstice, he again commenced his Northward march, they rejoiced and feasted; as they did at the summer Solstice, when
most he appeared to smile upon them in his pride of place. These days have been celebrated by all civilized nations ever since. The, Christian has made them feastdays of the church, and appropriated
them to the two Saints John and Masonry has done the same.
We, to whom the vast Universe has become but a great machine, not instinct with a great SOUL, but a clockwork of proportions unimaginable, but still infinitely less than infinite; and part at least of which
we with our orreries can imitate; we, who have measured the distances and dimensions, and learned the specific gravity and determined the orbits of the moon and the planets; we, who know the distance to
the sun, and his size; have measured the orbits of the flashing comets, and the distances of the fixed stars; and know the latter to be suns like our sun, each with its retinue of worlds, and all governed by
the same unerring mechanical laws and outwardly imposed forces centripetal and centrifugal we, who with our telescopes have separated the galaxy and the nebulae into other stars and groups of stars;
discovered new planets, by first discovering their disturbing force upon those already known; and learned that they all, Jupiter, Venus, and the fiery Mars, and Saturn and the others, as well the bright,
mild, and everchanging Moon, are mere dark, dull opaque clods like our earth, and not living orbs of brilliant fire and heavenly light; we, who have counted the mountains and chasms in the moon, with
glasses that could distinctly reveal to us the temple of Solomon, if it stood there in its old original glory; we, who no longer imagine that the stars control our destinies, and who can calculate the eclipses of the
sun and moon backward and forward, for ten thousand years; we, with our vastly increased conceptions of the powers of the Grand Architect of the Universe, but our wholly material and mechanical view of
that Universe itself; we cannot, even in the remotest degree, feel, though we may partially and imperfectly imagine, how those great primitive, simplehearted children of Nature felt in regard to the
Starry Hosts, there upon the slopes of the Himalayas, on the Chaldean plains, in the Persian and Median deserts, and upon the banks of that great, strange River, the Nile. To them the Universe was
alive instinct with forces and powers, mysterious and beyond their comprehension. To them it was no machine, no great system of clockwork; but a great live creature, an army of creatures, in sympathy
with or inimical to man. To them, all was a mystery and a miracle, and the stars flashing overhead spoke to their hearts almost in an audible language. Jupiter, with his kingly splendors, was the Emperor
of the starry legions. Venus looked lovingly on the earth and blessed it; Mars, with his crimson fires, threatened war and misfortune; and Saturn, cold; and grave, chilled and repelled them. The ever
changing Moon, faithful companion of the Sun, was a constant miracle and wonder the Sun himself the visible emblem of the creative and generative power. To them the earth was a great plain, over which
the Sun, the moon, and the planets revolved, its servants, framed to give it light.
Of the stars, some were beneficent existences that brought with them Springtime and fruits and flowers, some, faint sentinels, advising them of coming inundation, of the season storm and of deadly
winds; some heralds of evil, which, steadily foretelling, they seemed to cause. To them the eclipses

were portents of evil, and their causes hidden in mystery, and supernatural. The regular returns of the stars, the comings of Arcturus, Orion, Sirius, tbe Pleiades, and Aldebaran, and the journeyings of the
Sun, were voluntary and not mechanical to them. What wonder that astronomy became to them the most important of sciences; that those who learned it became rulers; and that vast edifices, the
Pyramids, the tower or temple of Bel, and other like erections everywhere in the East, were built for astronomical purposes and what wonder that, in their great childlike simplicity, they worshipped Light,
the Sun, the Planets, and the stars, and personified them, and eagerly believed in the histories invented for them; in that age when the capacity for belief was infinite; as indeed, if we but reflect, it still is and
ever will be?
If we adhered to the literally historic sense, antiquity would be a mere inexplicable, hideous chaos, and all the Sages deranged and so it would be with Masonry and those who instituted it. But when these
allegories are explained, they cease to be absurd fables, or facts purely local; and become lessons of wisdom for entire humanity. No one can doubt, who studies them, that they all came from a common
source.
All he greatly errs who imagines that, because the mythological legends and fables of antiquity are referable to and have their foundation in the phenomena of the Heavens, and all the Heathen Gods are
but mere names given to the Sun, the stars, the Planets, the Zodiacal signs, the Elements, the Powers of Nature, and Universal Nature herself, therefore the first men worshipped the Stars, and whatever things,
animate and inanimate, seemed to them to possess and exercise a power or influence, evident or imagined, over human fortunes and human destiny.
For ever, in all the nations, ascending to the remotest antiquity to which the light of History or the
glimmerings of tradition reach, we find, seated above all the gods which represent the luminaries and the elements, and those which personify the innate Powers of universal nature, a still higher Deity,
silent, undefined, incomprehensible, the Supreme, one God, from Whom all the rest flow or emanate, or by Him are created. Above the TimeGod Horus, the MoonGoddess or EarthGoddess Isis, and the
SunGod Osiris of the Egyptians, was Amun, the NatureGod; and above him, again, the Infinite, Incomprehensible Deity, ATHOM. BREHM, the silent, selfcontemplative, one original God, was the
source, to the Hindus of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. Above Zeus, or before him, were Kronos and Ouranos. Over the Alohayim was the great NatureGod AL, and still beyond him, Abstract Existence,
IHUH He that IS, WAS, and SHALL BE. Above all the Persian Deities was the Unlimited Time, ZERUANEAKHERENE; and Odin and Thor was the Great Scandinavian Deity ALFADIR.
The worship of Universal Nature as a God was too near akin to the worship of a Universal Soul, to have
been the instinctive creed of any savage people or rude race of men. To imagine all nature, with all its apparently independent parts, as forming one consistent whole, and as itself a unit, required an amount
of experience and a faculty of generalization not possessed by the rude uncivilized mind, and is but a

step below the idea of a universal Soul.
In the beginning man had the WORD; and that WORD was from God; and out of the living POWER communicated to man in and by that WORD came THE LIGHT of His Existence.
God made man in His own likeness. When, by a long succession of geological changes, He had
prepared the earth to be his habitation, He created him, and placed him in that part of Asia which the old nations agreed in calling the cradle of the human race, whence afterward the stream of human life
flowed forth to India, China, Egypt, Persia, Arabia, and Phoenicia. He communicated to him a knowledge of the nature of his Creator, and of the pure, primitive, undefiled religion. The peculiar and
distinctive excelence and real essence of the primitive man, and his true nature and destiny, consisted in his likeness to God. He stamped His own image upon man's soul. That image has been, in the breast of
every individual man and of mankind in general, greatly altered, impaired, and defaced; but its old, halfobliterated characters are still to be found on all the pages of primitive history and the impress, not
entirely effaced, every reflecting mind may discover in its own interior.
Of the original revelation to mankind, of the primitive WORD of Divine TRUTH, we find clear indications and scattered traces in the sacred traditions of all the primitive Nations; traces which, when
separately examined, appear like the broken remnants, the mysterious and hieroglyphic characters, of a mighty edifice that has been destroyed; and its fragments, like those of the old Temples and Palaces of
Nimroud, wrought incongruously into edifices many centuries younger. And, although amid the ever growing degeneracy of mankind, this primeval word of revelation falsified by the admixture of various
errors, and overlaid and obscured by numberless and manifold fictions, inextricably confused, and disfigured almost beyond the power of recognition, still a profound inquiry will discover in heathenism
many luminous vestiges of primitive Truth.
For the old Heathenism had everywhere a foundation in Truth; and if we could separate that pure intuition into nature and into the simple symbols of nature, that constituted the basis of all Heathenism,
from the alloy of error and the additions of fiction, those first hieroglyphic traits of the instinctive science of the first men, would be found to agree with truth and a true knowledge of nature, and to
afford an image of a free, pure, comprehensive, and finished philosophy of life.
The struggle, thenceforward to be eternal, between the Divine will and the natural will in the souls of men, commenced immediately after the creation. Cain slew his brother Abel, and went forth to people
parts of the earth with an impious race, forgetters and defiers of the true God.
The other Descendants of the Common Father of the race intermarried with the daughters of Cain's Descendants: and all nations preserved the remembrance of that division of the human family into the

righteous and impious, in their distorted legends of the wars between the Gods, and the Giants and Titans. When, afterward, another similar division occurred, the Descendants of Seth alone preserved
the true primitive religion and science, and transmitted them to posterity in the ancient symbolical character, on monuments of stone: and many nations preserved in their legendary traditions the memory
of the columns of Enoch and Seth.
Then the world declined from its original happy condition and fortunate estate, into idolatry and barbarism: but all nations retained the memory of that old estate; and the poets, in those early days the
only historians, commemorated the succession of the ages of gold, silver, brass, and iron.
In the lapse of those ages, the sacred tradition followed various courses among each of the most ancient nations; and from its original source, as from a common centre, its various streams flowed downward;
some diffusing through favored regions of the world fertility and life; but others soon losing themselves, and heing dried up in the sterile sands of human error.
After the internal and Divine WORD originally communicated by God to man, had become obscured;
after man's connect with his Creator had been broken, even outward language necessarily fell into disorder and confusion. The simple and Divine Truth was overlaid with various and sensual fictions,
buried under illusive symbols, and at last perverted into horrible phantoms.
For in the progress of idolatry it needs came to pass, that what was originally revered as the symbol of a higher principle, became gradually confounded or identified with the object itself, and was worshipped;
until this error led to a more degraded form of idolatry. The early nations received much from the primeval source of sacred tradition; but that haughty pride which seems inherent part of human nature
led each to represent these fragmentary relics of original truth as a possession peculiar to themselves; thus exaggerating their value, and their own importance, as peculiar favorites of the Deity, who had
chosen then the favored people to whom to commit these truths. To make these fragments, as far as possible, their private property, they reproduced them under peculiar forms, wrapped them up in
symbols, concealed them in allegories, and invented fables to account for their own special possession of them. So that, instead of preserving in their primitive simplicity and purity these blessings of
original revelation, they overlaid them with poetical ornament; and the whole wears a fabulous aspect, until by close and severe examination we discover the truth which the apparent fable contains.
These being the conflicting elements in the breast of man; the old inheritance or original dowry of
truth, imparted to him by God in the primitive revelation; and error, or the foundation for error, in his degraded sense and spirit now turned from God to nature, false faiths easily sprung up and grew rank
and luxuriant when the Divine Truth was no longer guarded with jealous care, nor preserved in its pristine purity.

This soon happened among most Eastern nations, and especially the Indians, the Chaldeans, the
Arabians, the Persians, and the Egyptians; with whom imagination, and a very deep but still sensual feeling for nature, were very predominant. The Northern firmament, visible to their eyes, possesses by
far the largest and most brilliant constellations; they were more alive to the impressions made by such objects, than are the men of the present day.
With the Chinese, a patriarchal, simple, and secluded people, idolatry long made but little progress.
They invented writing within three or four generations after the flood; and they long preserved the memory of much of the primitive revelation; less overlaid with fiction than those fragments which other
nations have remembered. They were among those who stood nearest to the source of sacred tradition; and many passages in their old writings contain remarkable vestiges of eternal truth, and of the WORD
of primitive revelation, the heritage of old thought, which attest to us their original eminence.
But among the other early nations, a wild enthusiasm and a sensual idolatry of nature soon superseded the simple worship of the Almighty God, and set aside or disfigured the pure belief in the Eternal
Uncreated Spirit. The great powers and elements of nature, and the vital principle of production and procreation through all generations; then the celestial spirits or heavenly Host, the luminous armies of
the Stars, and the great Sun, and mysterious, everchanging Moon (all of which the whole ancient world regarded not as mere globes of light or bodies of fire, but as animated living substances, potent over
man's fate and destinies); next the genii and tutelar spirits, and even the souls of the dead, received divine worship. The animals, representing the starry constellations, first reverenced as symbols merely,
came to be worshipped as gods; the heavens, earth, and the operations of nature were personified; and fictitious personages invented to account for the introduction of science and arts, and the fragments of
the old religious truths; and the good and bad principles personified, became also objects of worship; while, through all, still shone the silver threads of the old primitive revelation.
Increasing familiarity with early oriental records seems more and more to confirm the probability that
they all originally emanated from one source. The eastern and southern slopes of the Paropismus, or Hindukusch, appear to have been inhabited by kindred Iranian races, similar in habits, language, and
religion. The earliest Indian and Persian Deities are for the most part symbols of celestial light, their agency being regarded as an eternal warfare with the powers of Winter, stonn, and darkness. The
religion of both was originally a worship of outward nature, especially the manifestations of fire and light; the coincidences being too marked to be merely accidental. Deva, God, is derived from the root
div to shine.
Indra, like Ormuzd or AhuraMazda, is the bright firmament; Sura or Surya, the Heavenly, a name the Sun, recurs in the Zend word Huare, the Sun, whence Khur and Khorshid or Corasch. Uschas and Mitra
are Medic as well Zend Deities and the Amschaspands or "immortal Holy Ones" the ZendAvesta may

be compared with the seven Rishis or Vedic StarGod, of the constellation of the Bear. Zoroastrianism, like Buddhism, was an innovation in regard to an older religion; between the Parsee and Brahmin may
be found traces of disruption as well as of coincidence. The original Natureworship in which were combined the conceptions both of a Universal Presence and perpetuity of action, took different
directions of development, according to the difference between the Indian and Persian mind.
The early shepherds of the Punjaub, then called the country of the Seven Rivers, to whose intuitional or inspired wisdom (Veda) we owe what are perhaps the most ancient religious effusions extant in any
language, apostrophized as living beings the physical objects of their worship.
First in this order of Deities stands Indra, the God of the "blue" or "glittering" firmament, called Devaspiti, Father of the Devas or Elemental Powers, who measured out the circle of the sky, and made
fast the foundations of the Earth; the ideal domain of Varouna, "the Allencompasser" is almost equally extensive, including air, water, night, the expanse between Heaven and Earth; Agni, who lives on the
fire of sacrifice, on the domestic hearth, and in the lightnings of the sky, is the great Mediator between God and Man; Uschas, or Dawn, leads forth the Gods in the morning to make their daily repast in the
intoxicating Soma of Nature's offertory, of which the Priest could only compound from simples a symbolical imitation. Then came the various SunGods, Adityas or Solar Attributes, Surya the
Heavenly, Savitri the Progenitor, Pashan the Nourisher, Bagha the Felicitous, and Mitra the Friend.
The coming forth of the Eternal Being to the work of creation was represented as a marriage, his first emanation being a universal mother, supposed to have potentially existed with him from Eternity, or in
metaphorical language, to have been "his sister, his spouse." She became eventually promoted to be the Mother of the Indian Trinity, of the Deity under His three Attribute Creation, Preservation, and Change
or Regeneration.
The most popular forms or manifestations of Vishnu the Preserver, were his successive avataras or historic impersonations, which represented the Deity coming forth out of the incomprehsive mystery of
his nature, and revealing Himself at those critical epochs which either in the physical or moral world seemed to mark a new commencement of prosperity and order.
Combating the power of Evil in the various departments of Nature, and in successive periods of time,
the Divinity, though varying in form, is ever in reality the same, whether seen in useful agricultural or social inventions, in traditional victories over rival creeds, or in physical changes faintly discovered
through tradition, or suggested by cosmogonical theory. As Rama, the Epic hero armed with sword, club, and arrows, the prototype of Hercules and Mithras, he wrestles like the Hebrew Patriarch with the
Powers of Darkness; ChrishnaGovinda, the Divine Shepherd, he is the Messenger of Peace, overmastering the world by music and love. Under the human form he never ceases to be the Supreme

Being. "The foolish" (he says, in Bhagavad Ghita), "unacquainted with my Supreme Nature, despise me in this human form, while men of great minds, enlightened by the Divine principle within them,
acknowledge me as incorruptible and before all things, and serve me with undivided hearts." "I am not recognized by all," he says again, "because concealed by the supernatural power which is in me; yet to
me are known all things past, present, and to come; I existed before Vaivaswata and Menou. I am the Most High God, the Creator of the World, the Eternal Poorooscha (ManWorld or Genius of the World).

become manifest and am revealed from age to age, to save the just, to destroy the guilty, and to reassure the faltering steps of virtue. He who acknowledgeth me as even so, doth not on quitting this mortal
frame enter into another, for he entereth into me; and many who have trusted in me have already entered into me, being purified by the power of wisdom. I help those who walk in my path, even as they serve
me."
Brahma, the creating agent, sacrified himself, when, by descending into material forms, he became incorporated with his work; and his mythological history was interwoven with that of the Universe.
Thus, although spiritually allied to the Supreme, and Lord of all creatures (Prajapati), he shared the imperfection and corruption of an inferior nature, and, steeped in manifold ar perishable forms, might
be said, like the Greek Uranus, to be mutilated and fallen. He thus combined two characters, formless form, immortal and mortal, being and nonbeing, motion and rest. As Incarnate Intelligence, or THE
WORD, he communicated to man what had been revealed to himself by the Eternal, since he is creation's Soul as well as Body, within which the Divine Word is written in those living letters which it
is the prerogative of the selfconscious spirit to interpret.
The fundamental principles of the religion of the Hindus consisted in the belief in the existence of One Being only, of the immortality of the soul, and of a future state of rewards and punishments. Their
precepts of morality inculcate the practice of virtue as necessary for procuring happiness even in this transient life; and their religious doctrines make their felicity in a future state to depend upon it.
Besides their doctrine of the transmigration of souls, their dogmas may be epitomized under the
following heads: 1st The existence of one God, from Whom all things proceed, and to Whom all must return. To him they constantly apply these expressions. The Universal and Eternal Essence; that which
has ever been and will ever continue; that which vivifies and pervades all things; He who is everywhere present, and causes the celestial bodies to revolve in the course He has prescribed to them. 2d A
tripartite division of the Good Principle, for the purposes of Creation, Preservation, and Renovation by change and death. 3d. The necessary existence of an Evil Principle, occupied in counteracting the
benevolent purposes of the first, in their execution by the Devata or Subordinate Genii, to whom is entrusted the control over the various operations of nature.

And this was part of their doctrine: "One great and incomprehensible Being has alone existed from all Eternity. Everything we behold and we ourselves are portions of Him. The soul, mind or intellect, of
gods and men, and of all sentient creatures, are detached portions of the Universal Soul, to which at stated periods they are destined to return. But the mind of finite beings is impressed by one
uninterrupted series of illusions, which they consider as real, until again united to the great fountain of truth. Of these illusions, the first and most essential is individuality. By its influence, when detached
from its source, the soul becomes ignorant of its own nature, origin, and destiny. It considers itself as a separate existence, and no longer a spark of the Divinity, a link of one immeasurable chain, an infinitely
small but indispensable portion of one great whole."
Their love of imagery caused them to personify what they conceived to be some of the attributes of God, perhaps in order to present things in a way better adapted to the comprehensions of the vulgar,
than the abstruse idea of an indescribable, invisible God; and hence the invention of a Brahma, a Vishnu, and a Siva or Iswara. These were represented under various forms; but no emblem or visible
sign of Brihm or Brehm, the Omnipotent, is to be found. They considered the great mystery of the existence of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, as beyond human comprehension. Every creature
endowed with the faculty of thinking, they held, must be conscious of the existence of a God, a first cause; but the attempt to explain the nature of that Being, or in any way to assimilate it with our own,
they considered not only a proof of folly, but of extreme impiety.
The following extracts from their books will serve to show what were the real tenets of their creed:
"By one Supreme Ruler is this Universe pervaded; even every world in the whole circle of nature. There is one Supreme Spirit, which nothing can shake, more swift than the thought of man. That Supreme
Spirit moves at pleasure, but in itself is immovable; it is distant from us, yet near us; it pervades this whole system of worlds; yet it is infinitely beyond it. That man who considers all beings as existing
even in the Supreme Spirit, and the Supreme Spirit as pervading all beings, henceforth views no creature with contempt. All spiritual beings are the same in kind with the Supreme Spirit. The pure
enlightened soul assumes a luminous form, with no gross body, with no perforation, with no veins or tendons, unblemished, untainted by sin; itself being a ray from the Infinite Spirit, which knows the Past
and the Future, which pervades all, which existed with no cause but itself, which created all things as they are, in ages most remote. That allpervading Spirit which gives light to the visible Sun, even the
same in kind am I, though infinitely distant in degree. Let my soul return to the immortal Spirit of God, and then let my body, which ends in ashes, return to dust! O Spirit, who pervadest fire, lead us in a
straight path to the riches of beatitude".
"Thou, O God, possessesth all the treasures of knowledge! Remove each foul taint from our souls!"

"From what root springs mortal man, when felled by the hand of death? Who can make him spring again to birth? God, who is perfect wisdom, perfect happiness. He is the final refuge of tht man who
has liberally bestowed his wealth, who has been firm in virtue, who knows and adores that Great One. Let us adore the supremacy of that Divine Sun, the Godhead who illuminates all, who recreates all,
from whom all proceed, to whom all must return, whom we invoke to direct our understandings aright, in our progress toward his holy seat. What the Sun and Light are to this visible world, such is truth to
the intellectual and visible Universe.
Our souls acquire certain knowledge, by meditating on the light of Truth, which emanates from the Being of Beings. That Being, without eyes sees, without ears hears all; he knows whatever can be
known, but there is none who knows him; him the wise call the Great, Supreme, Pervading Spirit.
Perfect Truth, Perfect Happiness, without equal, immortal; absolute unity, whom neither speech can describe, nor mind comprehend: allpervading, alltranscending, delighted with his own boundless
intelligence, nor limited by space or time; without feet, running swiftly; without hands, grasping all worlds; without eyes, allsurveying; without ears, allhearing; without; an intelligent guide,
understanding all; without cause,the first of all causes; allruling, allpowerful, the Creator, Preserver, Transformer of all things: such is the Great One; this the Vedas declare".
"May that soul of mine, which mounts aloft in my waking hours as an ethereal spark, and which, even
in my slumber, has a like ascent, soaring to a great distance, as an emanation from the Light of Lights, be united by devout meditation with the Spirit supremely blest, and supremely intelligent! May that soul
of mine, which was itself the primeval oblation placed within all creatures which is a ray of perfect wisdom, which is the inextinguishable light fixed within created bodies, without which no good act is
performed in which as an immortal essence may be comprised whatever has passed, is present, or will be hereafter be united by devout meditation with the Spirit supremely blest and supremely intelligent"!
"The Being of Beings is the Only God, eternal and everywhere present, Who comprises everything.
There is no God but He. The supreme Being is invisible, incomprehensible, immovable, without figure or shape. No one has ever seen Him; time never comprised Him; His essence pervades everything; all
was derived from Him".
"The duty of a good man, even in the moment of his destruction, consists not only in forgiving, but even in a desire of benefiting his destroyer; as the sandaltree, in the instant of its overthrow, sheds perfume
on the axe which fells it."
The Vedanta and Nyaya philosophers acknowledge a Supreme Eternal Being, and the immortality of the soul: though, like the Greeks, they differ in their ideas of those subjects. They speak of the Supreme

435/641
Being as an eternal essence that pervades space, and gives life or existence. Of that universal and eternal pervading spirit, the Vedanti suppose four modifications; but as these do not change its nature,
and as it would be erroneous to ascribe to each of them a distinct essence, so it is equally erroneous, they say, to imagine that the various modifications by which the All pervading Being exists, or displays
His power, are individual existences. Creation is not considered as the instant production of things, but only as the manifestation of that which exists eternally in the one Universal Being. The Nyaya
philosophers believe that spirit and matter are eternal; but they do not suppose that the world in its present form has existed from eternity, but only the primary matter from which it sprang when operated
on by the almighty Word of God, the Intelligent Cause and Supreme Being, Who produced the combinations or aggregations which compose the material universe. Though they believe that soul is an
emanation from the Supreme Being, they distinguish it from that Being, in its individual existence. Truth and Intelligence are the eternal attributes of God, not, they say, of the individual soul, which is
susceptible both of knowledge and ignorance, of pleasure and pain; and therefore God and it are distinct. Even when it returns to the Eternal, and attains supreme bliss, it undoubtedly does not cease.
Though united to the Supreme Being, it is not absorbed in it, but still retains the abstract nature of definite or visible existence.
"The dissolution of the world," they say, "consists in the destruction of the visible forms and qualities of
things; but their material essence remains, and from it new worlds are formed by the creative energy of God; and thus the universe is dissolved and renewed in endless succession."
The Jainas, a sect at Mysore and elsewhere, say that the ancient religion of India and of the whole
world consisted in the belief in one God, a pure Spirit, indivisible, omniscient and allpowerful; that God, having given to all things their appointed order and course of action, and to man a sufficient
portion of reason or understanding, to guide him in his conduct, leaves him the operation of free will, without the entire exercise of which he could not be held answerable for his conduct.
Menou, the Hindu lawgiver, adored, not the visible, material Sun, but "that divine and incomparably
greater light," to use the words of the most venerable text in the Indian scripture, "which illumines all, delights all, from which all proceed, to which all must return, and which alone can irradiate our
intellects." He thus commences his Institutes:
"Be it heard"!
"This Universe existed only in the first divine idea yet unexpanded, as if involved in darkness, imperceptible, undefinable, undiscoverable by reason, and undiscovered by revelation, as if it were
wholly immersed in sleep".

"Then the Sole Selfexisting Power, Himself undiscovered, but making this world discernible, with five elements, and other principles of nature, appeared with undiminished glory, expanding His idea, or
dispelling the gloom".
"He Whom the mind alone can perceive, whose esscence eludes the eternal organs, who has no visible parts, who exists from Eternity, even He, the soul of all beings, Whom no being can comprehend, shone
forth".
"He, having willed to produce various beings from His own divine Substance, first with a thought created the waters. From that which is [precisely the Hebrew], the first cause, not the object of sense,
existing everywhere in substance, not existing to our perception, without beginning or end" [the A.'. Omega .'., the I.'. A.'. Omega .'.], "was produced the divine male famed in all worlds under the
appellation of Brahma".
Then recapitulating the different things created by Brahma adds: "He," meaning Brahma [the Aoyos, the Word] "whose powers are incomprehensible, having thus created this Universe, was again absorbed
in the Supreme Spirit, changing the time of energy for the time of repose".
The Antareya A'ran'ya, one of the Vedas, gives this primitive idea of the creation: "In the beginning, the Universe was but a Soul, nothing else, active or inactive, existed. Then He had this thought, I will create
worlds; and thus He created these different worlds; air, the light, mortal beings, and the waters.
"He had this thought: "Behold the worlds; I will create guardians for the worlds". So He took of the water and fashioned a being clothed with the human form. He looked upon him and of that being so
contemplated, the mouth opened like all egg, and speech came forth, and from the speech fire. The nostrils opened, and through them went the breath of respiration, and by it the air was propagated. The
eyes opened; from them came a luminous ray, and from it was produced the sun. The ears dilated; from them came hearing, and from hearing space: " and, after the body of man, with the senses, was formed;
He, the universal Soul, thus reflected: How can this body exist without Me"? He examined through what extremity He could penetrate it. He said to Himself: "If, without Me, the World is articulated,
breath exhales, and sight sees; if hearing hears, the skin feels, and the mind reflects, deglutition swallows, and the genarative organ fulfills its functions, what then am I"? And separating the suture of
the cranium, He penetrated into man."
Behold the great fundamental primitive truths! God, an infinite Eternal Soul or Spirit. Matter, not eternal nor selfexistent, but created created by a thought of God. After matter, and worlds, then man,
by a like thought and finally, after endowing him with the senses and a thinking mind, a portion, a spark, of God Himself penetrates the man, and becomes a living spirit within him.

The Vedas thus detail the creation of the world:
"In the beginning there was a single God, existing of Himself; Who, after having passed an eternity
absorbed in the contemplation of His own being, desired to manifest His perfections outwardly of Himself; and created the matter of the world. The four elements being thus produced, but still mingled
in confusion, He breathed upon the waters, which swelled up into
an immense ball in the shape of an egg, and, developing themselves, became the vault and orb of
Heaven which encircles the earth. Having made the earth and the bodies of animal beings, this God, the essence of movement, gave to them, to animate them, a portion of His own being. Thus, the soul of
everything that breathes being a fraction of the universal soul, none
perishes; but each soul merely changes its mould and form, by passing succcessively into different
bodies. Of all forms, that which most pleases the Divine Being is Man, as nearest approaching His own perfections. When a man, absolutely disengaging himself from his senses, absorbs himself in self
contemplation, he comes to discern the Divinity, and becomes part of
Him."
The Ancient Persians in many respects resembled the Hindus, in their language, their poetry, and their
poetic legends. Their conquests brought them in contact with China; and they subdued Egypt and Judea. Their views of God and religion more resembled those of the Hebrews than those of any other
nation, and indeed the latter people borrowed from them some prominent doctrines, that we are in the habit of regarding as an essential part of the original Hebrew creed.
Of the King of Heaven and Father of Eternal Light, of the pure World of Light, of the Eternal Word by
which all things were created, of the Seven Mighty Spirits that stand next to the Throne of Light and Omnipotence, and of the glory of those Heavenly Hosts that encompass that Throne, of the Origin of
Evil, and the Prince of Darkness, Monarch of the rebellious spirits, enemies of all good, they entertainecl tenets very similar to those of the Hebrews. Toward Egyptian idolatry they felt the strongest
abhorrence, and under Cambyses pursued a regular plan for its utter extirpation. Xerxes, when he invaded Greece, destroyed the Temples and erected firechapels along the whole course of his march.
Their religion was eminently spiritual, and the earthly fire and earthly sacrifice were but the signs and emblems of another devotion and a higher power.
Thus the fundamental doctrine of the ancient religion of India and Persia was at first nothing more than
a simple veneration of nature, its pure elements and its primary energies, the sacred fire, and above all, Light, the air, not the lower atmospheric air the purer and brighter air of Heaven, the breath that
animates and pervades the breath of mortal life.

438/641
This pure and simple veneration of nature is perhaps the most ancient, and was by far the most
generally prevalent in the primitive and patriarchal world. It was not originally a deification of nature, or a denial of the sovereignty of God. Those pure elements and primitive essences of created nature
offered to the first men, still in a close communication with the Deity, not a likeness of resemblance, nor a mere fanciful image or a poetical figure, but a natural and true symbol of Divine power.
Everywhere in the Hebrew writings the pure light or sacred fire is employed as an image of the all pervading and allconsuming power and omnipresence of the
Divinity. His breath was the first source of life; and the faint whisper of the breeze announced to the prophet His immediate presence.
"All things are the progeny of one fire. The Father perfected all things, and delivered them over to the
Second Mind, whom all nations of men call the First. Natural works coexist with the intellectual light of the Father; for it is the Soul which adorns the great Heaven, and which adorns it after the Father. The
Soul, being a bright fire, by the power of the Father, remains immortal, and is mistress of life, and fills up the recesses of the world. For the fire which is first beyond, did not shut up his power in matter by
works, but by mind, for the framer of the fiery world is the mind of mind, who first sprang from mind, clothing fire with fire. Fatherbegotten Light ! for He alone, having from the Father's power received the
essence of intellect, is enabled to understand the mind of the Father; and to instill into all sources and principles tlle capacity of understanding, and of ever continuing in ceaseless revolving motion." Such
was the language of Zoroaster, embodying the old Persian ideas.
And the same ancient sage thus spoke of the Sun and Stars: "The Father made the whole Universe of fire and water and earth, and allnourishing ether. He fixed a great multitude of moveless stars, that
stand still forever, not by compulsion and unwillingly, but without desire to wander, fire acting upon fire. He congregated the seven firmaments of the world, and so surrounded the earth with the convexity
of the Heavens; and therein set seven living existences, arranging their apparent disorder in regular orbits, six of them planets, and the Sun, placed in the centre, the seventh; in that centre from which all
lines, diverging which way soever, are equal; and the swift sun himself, revolving around a principal centre, and ever striving to reach the central and allpervading light, bearing with him the bright
Moon."
And yet Zoroaster added: "Measure not the journeyings of the sun, nor attempt to reduce them to rule; for he is carried by the eternal will of the Father, not for your sake. Do not endeavor to understand the
impetuous course of the Moon; for she runs evermore under the impulse of necessity; and the progression of the Stars was not generated to serve any purpose of yours."
Ormuzd says to Zoroaster, in the Boundehesch: "I am he who holds the StarSpangled Heaven in

ethereal space; who makes, this sphere, which once was buried in darkness, a flood of light. Through me the Earth became a world firm and lasting the earth on which walks the Lord of the world. I am he
who makes the light of Sun, Moon, and Stars pierce the clouds. I make the corn seed, which perishing in the ground sprouts anew. I created man, whose eye is light, whose life is the breath of his nostrils. I
placed within him life's unextinguishable power."
Ormuzd or AhuraMazda himself represented the primal light, distinct from the heavenly bodies, yet necessary to their existence, and the source of their splendor. The Amschaspands (Ameschaspenta,
"immortal Holy Ones"), each presided over a special department of nature. Earth and Heaven, fire and water, the Sun and Moon, the rivers, trees, and mountains, even the artificial divisions of the day and
year were addressed in prayer as tenanted by Divine beings, each separately ruling within his several sphere. Fire, in particular, that "most energetic of immortal powers," the visible representative of the
primal light, was invoked as "son of Ormuzd. " The Sun, the Archimagus, that noblest and most powerful agent of divine power, who "steps forth as a Conqueror from the top of the terrible Alborj to
rule over the world which he enlightens from the throne of Ormuzd," was worshipped among other symbols by the name of MITHRAS, a beneficent and friendly genius, who, in the hymn addressed to
him in the ZendAvesta, bears the names given him by the Greeks, as the "Invincible" and the "Mediator"; the former, because in his daily strife with darkness he is the most active confederate of
Ormuzd; the latter, as being the medium through which Heaven's choicest blessings are communicated to men. He is called "the eye of Ormuzd, the effulgent Hero, pursuing his course triumphantly, fertilizer
of deserts, most exalted of the Izeds or Yezatas, the neversleeping the protector of the land." "When the dragon foe devastates my provinces," says Ormuzd, "and afflicts them with famine, then is he struck
down by the strong arm of Mithras, together with the Devs of Mazanderan. With his lance and his immortal club, the Sleepless Chief hurls down the Devs into the dust, when as Mediator he interposes
to guard the city from evil."
Ahriman was by some Parsee sects considered older than Ormuzd, as darkness is older than light; he is imagined to have been unknown as a Malevolent Being in the early ages of the world, and the fall of
man is attributed in the Boundehescll to an apostate worship of him, from which men were converted by a succession of prophets terminating with Zoroaster.
Mithras is not only light, but intelligence; that luminary which, though born in obscurity, will not only
dispel darkness but conquer death. The warfare through which this consummation is to be reached, is mainly carried on through the instrumentality of the "Word," that "everliving emanation of the Deity,
by virtue of which the world exists," and of which the revealed formulas incessantly repeated in the liturgies of the Magi are but the expression. "What shall I do," cried Zoroaster, "O Ormuzd, steeped in
brightness, in order to battle with DaroodjAhriman, father of the Evil Law; how shall I make men pure and holy?" Ormuzd answered and said: "Invoke, O Zoroaster, the pure law of the Servants of Ormuzd;
invoke the Amschaspands who shed abundance throughout the seven Keshwars; invoke the Heaven, ZeruanaAkarana, the birds travailing on high, the swift wind, the Earth; invoke my Spirit, me who am

AhuraMazda, the purest, strongest, wisest, best of beings; me who have the most majestic body, who through purity am Supreme, whose Soul is the Excellent Word; and ye, all people, invoke me as I have
commanded Zoroaster."
AhuraMazda himself is the living WORD; he is called "Firstborn of all things, express image of the Eternal, very light of very light, the Creator, who by power of the Word which he never ceases to
pronounce, made in 365 days the Heaven and the Earth." The Word is said in the Yashna to have existed before all, and to be itself a Yazata, a personified object of prayer. It was revealed in Serosch, in Homa,
and again, under Gushtasp, was manifested in Zoroaster.
Between life and death, between sunshine and shade, Mithras is the present exemplification of the Primal Unity from which all things arose, and into which, through his mediation, all contrarietics will
ultimately be absorbed. His annual sacrifice is the pasover of the Magi, a symbolical atonement or pledge of moral and physical regeneration. He created the world in the beginning; and as at the close of
each successive year he sets free the current of life to invigorate a fresh circle of being, so in the end of all things he will bring the weary sum of ages as a hecatomb before God, releasing by a final sacrifice
the Soul of Nature from her perishable frame, to commence a brighter and purer existence.
Iamblichus (De Mys. viii. 4) says: "The Egyptians are far from ascribing all things to physical causes; life and intellect they distinguish from physical being, both in man and in the Universe. They place
intellect and reason first as selfexistent, and from these they derive the created world. As Parent of generated things they constitute a Demiurge, and acknowledge a vital force both the Heavens and before
the Heavens. They place Pure Intellect above and beyond the Universe, and another (that is, Mind vealed in the Material World), consisting of one continuous mind pervading the Universe, and
apportioned to all its parts a spheres." The Egyptian idea, then, was that of all transcendental philosophy that of a Deity both immanent and transcendent spirit passing into its manifestations, but
not exhausted by so doing.
The wisdom recorded in the canonical rolls of Hermes quickly attained in this transcendental lore, all that human curiosity can ever discover. Thebes especially is said to have acknowledged a being without
beginning or end, called Amun or AmunKneph, the allprevading Spirit or Breath of Nature, or perhaps even some still more lofty object of reverential reflection, whom it was forbidden even to name.
Such a being would in theory stand the head of the three orders of Gods mentioned by Herodotus, these being regarded as arbitrary classifications of similar or equal beings, arranged in successive
emanations, according to an estimate of their comparative dignity. The Eight Great Gods, or primary class, were probably manifestations of the emanated God in the several parts and powers of the
Universe, each potentially comprising the whole Godhead.

In the ancient Hermetic books, as quoted by Iamblichus, occurred the following passage in regard to the Supreme Being:
"Before all the things that actually exist, and before all beginnings, there is one God, prior even to the
first God and King, remaining unmoved in the singleness of his own Unity: for neither is anything conceived by intellect inwoven with him, nor anything else, but he is established as the exemplar of the
God who is good, who is his own father, selfbegotten, and has only one Parent. For he is something greater and prior to, and the fountain of all things, and the foundation of things conceived by the
intellect, which are the first species. And from this ONE, the selforiginated God caused himself to shine forth; for which reason he is his own father, and selforiginated. For he is both a beginning and
God of Gods, a Monad from the One, prior to substance and the beginning of substance; for from him is substantiality and substance, whence also he is called the beginning of things conceived by the
intellect. These then are the most ancient beginnings of all things, which Hermes places before the ethereal and empyrean and celestial Gods."
"CHANGTI, Or the Supreme Lord or Being," said the old Chinese creed, "is the principle of
everything that exists, and Father of all living. He is eternal, immovable, and independent. His power knows no bounds, His sight equally comprehends the Past, the Present, and the Future, and penetrates
even to the inmost recesses of the heart. Heaven and earth are under his government; all events, all revolutions, are the consequences of his dispensation and will. He is pure, holy, and impartial;
wickedness offends his sight; but he beholds with an eye of complacency the virtuous actions of men. Severe, yet just, he punishes vice in an exemplary manner, even in Princes and Rulers; and often casts
down the guilty, to crown with honor the man who walks after his own heart, and whom he raises from obscurity.
Good, merciful, and full of pity, he forgives the wicked upon their repentance and public calamities and
the irregularity of the seasons are but salutary warnings, which his fatherly goodness gives to men, to induce them to reform and amend."
Controlled by reason infinitely more than by the imagination, that people, occupying the extreme East
of Asia, did not fall into idolatry until after the time of Confucius, and within two centuries of the birth of Christ; when the religion of BUDDHA or FO was carried thither from India.
Their system was long regulated by the pure worship of God, and the foundation of their moral and
political existence laid in a sound, upright reason, conformable to true ideas of the Deity. They had no false gods or images, and their third Emperor Hoamti erected a Temple, the first probably ever erected,
to the Great Architect of the Universe. And though they offered sacrifices to divers tutelary angels, yet they honored them infinitely less than XAMTI or CHANGTI, the Sovereign Lord of the World.

Confucius forbade making images or representations of Deity. He attached no idea of personality to
Him; but considered Him as a Power or Principle, pervading all Nature. And the Chinese designated the Divinity by the name of THE DIVINE REASON.
The Japanese believe in a Supreme Invisible Being, not to represented by images or worshipped in
Temples. They styled him AMIDA or OMITH; and say that he is without beginning end; that he came on earth, where he remained a thousand years, and became the Redeemer of our fallen race, that he is to
judge all men; and the good are to live forever, while the bad are to condemned to Hell.
"The Changti is represented," said Confucius, "under the general emblem of the visible firmament, as well as under the particular symbols of the sun, the Moon, and the Earth, because by their means we
enjoy the gifts of the Changti. The Sun is the source of life and light: the Moon illuminates the world by night. By observing the course of these luminaries, mankind are enabled to distinguish times and
seasons. The Ancients, with the view of connecting the act with its object, when they established the practice of sacrificing to the Changti, fixed the day the Winter Solstice, because the Sun, after having
passed through the twelve places assigned apparently by the Changti as its annual residence, began its career anew, to distribute blessings throughout the Earth."
He said: "The TEEN is the universal principle and prolific source of all things. The Changti is the
universal principle of existence."
The Arabians never possessed a poetical, highwrought, and scientifically arranged system of Polytheism. Their historical traditions had much analogy with those of the Hebrews, coincided with
them in a variety of points. The tradition of a purer faith and the simple Patriarchal worship of the Deity appear never to have been totally extinguished among them; nor did idolatry gain much foothold until
near the time of Mahomet; who adopting the old primeval faith, taught again doctrine of one God, adding to it that he was His Prophet.
To the mass of Hebrews, as well as to other nations, seem to have come fragments only of the primitive
revelation: nor do they seem, until after their captivity among the Persians, to have concerned themselves about metaphysical speculations in regard to the Divine Nature and essence; although it is
evident, from the Psalms of David, that a select body among them preserved a knowledge, in regard to the Deity, which was wholly unknown to the mass of the people; and those chosen few were made the
medium of transition for certain truths, to later ages.
Among the Greeks, the scholars of the Egyptians, all the higher ideas and severer doctrines on the

Divinity, his Sovereign Nature and Infinite Might, the Eternal Wisdom and Providence that conducts and directs all things to their proper end, the Infinite Mind and Supreme Intelligence that created all
things, and is raised far above external nature, all these loftier ideas and nobler doctrines were expounded more or less perfectly by Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Socrates, and developed in the most
beautiful and luminous manner by Plato, and the philosophers that succeeded him. And even in the popular religion of the Greeks are many things capable of a deeper import and more spiritual
signification; though they seem only rare vestiges of ancient truth, vague presentiments, fugitive tones, and momentary flashes, revealing a belief in a Supreme Being, Almighty Creator of the Universe, and
Common Father of Mankind.
Much of the primitive Truth was taught to Pythagoras by Zoroaster, who himself received it from the Indians. His disciples rejected the use of Temples, of Altars, and of Statues; and smiled at the folly of
those nations who imagined that the Deity sprang from or had any affinity with human nature. The tops of the highest mountains were the places chosen for sacrifices. Hymns and prayers were their principal
worship. The supreme God, who fills the wide circle of Heaven, was the object to Whom they were addressed. Such is the testimony of Herodotus. Light they considered not so much as an object of
worship, as rather the most pure and lively emblem of, and first emanation from, the Eternal God; and thought that man required something visible or tangible to exalt his mind to that degree of adoration
which is due to the Divine Being.
There was a surprising similarity between the Temples, Priests, doctrines, and worship of the Persian Magi and the British Druids. The latter did not worship idols in the human shape, because they held
that the Divinity, being invisible, ought to adored without being seen. They asserted the Unity of the Godhead. Their invocations were made to the One Allpreserving Power; and they argued that, as this
power was not matter must necessarily be the Deity; and the secret symbol used express his name was O.I.W. They believed that the earth had sustained one general destruction by water; and would again be
destroyed by fire. They admitted the doctrines of the immortality of the soul, a future state, and a day of judgment, which would be conducted on the principle of man's responsibility. They even retained some
idea of the redemption of mankind through the death of a Mediator. They retained a tradition the Deluge, perverted and localized. But, around these fragments of primitive truth they wove a web of
idolatry, worshipped two Subordinate Deities under the names of HU and CERIDWEN, male and female (doubtless the same as Osiris and Isis), and held doctrine of transmigration.
The early inhabitants of Scandinavia believed in a God who was "the Author of everything that existeth;
the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and Awful Being, the Searcher into concealed things, the Being that never changeth." Idols, visible representations of the Deity were originally forbidden, and He was
directed to be worshipped in the lonely solitude sequestered forests, where He was said to dwell, invisible, an perfect silence.

The Druids, like their Eastern ancestors, paid the most sacred regard to the odd numbers, which; traced backward, ended in Unity or Deity, while the even numbers ended in nothing. 3 was particularly
reverenced. 19 (7+3+3^2): 30 (7 X 3 + 3 X 3); and 21 (7 X 3) were numbers observed in the erection of their temples, constantly appearing in their dimensions, and the number and distances of the huge
stones.
They were the sole interpreters of religion. They superintended all sacrifices; for no private person could offer one with their permission. They exercised the power of excommunication; and without their
concurrence war could not be declared nor peace made and they even had the power of inflicting the punishment of death. They professed to possess a knowledge magic, and practised augury for the public
service.
They cultivated many of the liberal sciences, and particuly astronomy, the favorite science of the Orient; in which they attained considerable proficiency. They considered day as the offspring of night,
and therefore made their computations by nights instead of days and we, from them, still use the words fortnight and sen'night. They knew the division of the heavens into constellations; and finally, they
practised the strictest morality, having particularly the most sacred regard for that peculiarly Masonic virtue, Truth.
In the Icelandic Prose Edda is the following dialogue:
"Who is the first or eldest of the Gods?"
"In our language he is called, ALFADIR (AllFather, or the Father of All); but in the old Asgard he had
twelve names".
"Where is this God? What is his power? and what hath he done to display his glory?"
"He liveth from all ages, he governeth all realms, and swayeth all things both great and small".
"He hath formed Heaven and earth, and the air, and all things thereunto belonging".
"He hath made man and given him a soul which shall live and never perish, though the body shall have mouldered away or have been burnt to ashes. And all that are righteous shall dwell with him in the
place called Gimli or Vingolf; but the wicked shall go to Hel and thence to Niflhel which is below, in

the ninth world."
Almost every heathen nation, so far as we have any knowledge of their mythology, believed in one Supreme Overruling God, whose name it was not lawful to utter.
"When we ascend," says Muller, to the most distant heights of Greek history, the idea of God as the
Supreme Being stands before us as a simple fact. Next to this adoration of One God, the Father of Heaven, the Father of men, we find in Greece a Worship of Nature." The original was the God or Gods,
called by the Greeks the Son of Time, meaning that there was no God before Him, but He was Eternal. "Zeus," says the Orphic line, "is the Beginning, Zeus the Middle; out of Zeus all things have been
made." And the Peleides of Dodona said, "Zeus was, Zeus is, Zeus will be; O great Zeus!" and he was Zeus Best and Greatest.
The Parsees, retaining the old religion taught by Zaradisht, say in their catechism: "We believe in only
one God, and do not believe in any beside Him; Who created the Heavens, the Earth, the Angels. Our God has neither face nor form, colour nor shape, nor fixed place. There is no other like Him, nor can
our mind comprehend Him."
The Tetragrammaton, or some other word covered by it, was forbidden to be pronounced. But that its pronunciation might not be lost among the Levites, the HighPriest uttered it in the Temple once a year,
on the 10th day of the Month Tisri, the day of the great feast of expiation. During this ceremony, the people were directed to make a great noise, that the Sacred Word might not be heard by any who had
not a right to it; for every other, said the Jews, would be incontinently stricken dead.
The Great Egyptian Initiates, before the time of the Jews, did the same thing in regard to the word Isis; which they regarded as sacred and incommunicable.
Origen says: "There are names which have a natural potency. Such as those which the Sages used
among the Egyptians, the Magi in Persia, the Brahmins in India. What is called Magic is not a vain and chimerical act, as the Stoics and Epicureans pretend. The names SABAOTII and ADONAI were not
made for created beings; but they belong to a mysterious theology, which goes back to the Creator. From Him comes the virtue of these names, when they are arranged and pronounced according to the
rules."
The Hindu word AUM represented the three Powers combined in their Deity; Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva; or the Creating, Preserving, and Destroying Powers: A, the first; U or OO, the, second; and M,
the third. This word could not be pronounced except by the letters, for its pronunciation as one word

was said to make Earth tremble, and even the Angels of Heaven to quake for fear.
The word AUM, says the Ramayan, represents "The Being of Beings, One Substance in three forms; without mode, without quality without passion, Immense, Incomprehensible, Infinite, Indivisible,
Immutable, Incorporeal, Irresistible."
An old passage in the Purana says: "All the rites ordained in the Vedas, the sacrifices to the fire. and all other solemn purifications, shall pass away; but that which shall never pass away is the word A.'.OO.'.
M.'. for it is the symbol of the Lord of all things."
Herodotus says that the Ancient Pelasgi built no temples and worshipped no idols, and had a sacred name of Deity, which it was not permissible to pronounce.
The Clarian Oracle, which was of unknown antiquity, being asked which of the Deities was named
IAQ, answered in these remarkable words: "The Initiated are bound to conceal the mysterious secrets. Learn, then, that IAQ is the Great God Supreme, that ruleth over all."
The Jews consider the True Name of God to be irrecoverably lost by disuse, and regard its
pronunciation as one of the Mysteries that will be revealed at the coming of their Messiah. And they attribute its loss to the illegality of applying the Masoretic points to so sacred a Name, by which a
knowledge of the proper vowels is forgotten. It is even said, in the Gemara of Abodah Zara, that God permitted a celebrated Hebrew Scholar to be burned by a Roman Emperor, because he had been heard
to pronounce the Sacred Name with points.
The Jews feared that the Heathen would get possession of the Name and therefore, in their copies of the Scriptures, they wrote it in the Samaritan character, instead of the Hebrew or Chaldaeic, that the
adversary might not make an improper use of it for they believed it capable of working miracles; and held that the wonders in Egypt were performed by Moses, in virtue of this name being engraved on his
rod and that any person who knew the true pronunciation would be able to do as much as he did.
Josephus says it was unknown until God communicated it to Moses in the wilderness: and that it was lost through the wickedness of man.
The followers of Mahomet have a tradition that there is a secret name of the Deity which possesses
wonderful properties; and that the only method of becoming acquainted with it, is by being initiated into the Mysteries of the Ism Abla.

H.'.O.'.M.'. was the first framer of the new religion among the Persians, and His Name was Ineffable.
AMUN, among the Egyptians, was a name pronounceable by none save the Priests.
The old Germans adored God with profound reverence, without during to name Him, or to worship
Him in Temples.
The Druids expressed the name of Deity by the letters O.'.I.'.W.'.
Among all the nations of primitive antiquity, the doctrine of the immortality of the soul was not a mere probable hypothesis, needing laborious researches and diffuse argumentation to produce conviction of
its truth. Nor can we hardly give it the name of Faith; for it was a lively certainty, like the feeling of one's own existence and identity, and of what is actually present; exerting its influence on all sublunary
affairs, and the motive of mightier deeds and enterprises than any mere earthly interest could inspire
Even the doctrine of transmigration of souls, universal among the Ancient Hindus and Egyptians, rested on a basis of the old primitive religion, and was connected with a sentiment purely religious. It
involved this noble element of truth: That since man had gone astray, and wandered far from God, he must needs make many efforts, and undergo a long and painful pilgrimage, before he could rejoin the
Source of all Perfection and the firm conviction and positive certainty, that nothing defective, impure, or defiled with earthy stains, could enter the pure region of perfect spirits, or be eternally united to
God; wherefore the soul had to pass through long trials and many purifications before it could attain that blissful end. And the end and aim of all these systems of philosophy was the final deliverance of
the soul from the old calamity, the dreaded fate and frightful lot of being compelled to wander through the dark regions of nature and the various forms of the brute creation, ever changing its terrestrial
shape, and its union with God, which they held to be the lofty destiny of the wise and virtuous soul.
Pythagoras gave to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls that meaning which the wise Egyptians gave to it in their mysteries. He never taught the doctrine in that literal sense in which it was understood
by the people. Of that literal doctrine not the least vestige is to be found in such of his symbols as remain, nor in his precepts collected by his disciple Lysias. He held that men always remain, in their
essence, such as they were created; and can degrade themselves only by vice, and ennoble themselves only by virtue.
Hierocles, one of his most zealous and celebrated disciples, expressly says that he who believes that the

soul of man, after his death, will enter the body of a beast, for his vices, or become a plant for his stupidity, is deceived; and is absolutely ignorant of the eternal form of the soul, which can never
change; for, always remaining man, it is said to become God or beast, through virtue or vice, though it can become neither one nor the other by nature, but solely by resemblance of its inclinations to theirs.
And Timaeus of Locria, another disciple, says that to alarm men and prevent them from committing
crimes, they menaced them with strange humiliations and punishments; even declaring that their souls would pass into new bodies, that of a coward into the body of a deer; that of a ravisher into the body of
a wolf; that of a murderer into the body of some still more ferocious animal; and that of an impure sensualist into the body of a hog.
So, too, the doctrine is explained in the Phaedo. And Lysias says, that after the soul, purified of its
crimes, has left the body and returned to Heaven, it is no longer subject to change or death, but enjoys an eternal felicity. According to the Indians, it returned to, and became a part of, the universal soul
which animates everything. The Hindus held that Buddha descended on earth to raise all human beings up to the perfect state. He will ultimately succeed, and all, himself included, be merged in Unity.
Vishnu is to judge the world at the last day. It is to be consumed by fire. The Sun and Moon are to lose
their light; the Stars to fall; and a New Heaven and Earth to be created.
The legend of the fall of the Spirits, obscured and distorted, is preserved in the Hindu Mythology. And their traditions acknowledged, and they revered, the succession of the first ancestors of mankind, or the
Holy Patriarchs of the primitive world, under the name of the Seven Great RISHIS, or Sages of hoary antiquity; though they invested their history with a cloud of fictions.
The Egyptians held that the soul was immortal; and that Osiris was to judge the world.
And thus reads the Persian legend:
"After Ahriman shall have ruled the world until the end of time, SOSIOSCH, the promised Redeemer,
will come and annihilate the power of the DEVS (or Evil Spirits), awaken the dead, and sit in final judgment upon spirits and men. After that the comet Gurzsher will he thrown down, and a general
conflagration take place, which will consume the whole world. The remains of the earth will then sink down into Duzakh, and become for three periods a place of punishment for the wicked. Then, by
degrees all will be pardoned, even Ahriman and the Devs, and admitted the regions of bliss, and thus there will be a new Heaven an new earth."

In the doctrines of Lamaism also, we find, obscured, and partly concealed in fiction, fragments of the
primitive truth. For, according to that faith, "There is to be a final judgment before ESLIK KHAN: The good are to be admitted to Paradise, the bad to be banished to hell, where there are eight regions
burning hot and eight freezing cold. "In the Mysteries, wherever they were practised, was taught that truth of the primitive revelation, the existence of One Great Being, Infinite and pervading the Universe,
Who was there worshipped without superstition; and His marvellous nature, essence and attributes taught to the Initiates; while the vulgar attributed His works to Secondary Gods, personified, and
isolated from Him in fabulous independence.
These truths were covered from the common people as with a veil; and the Mysteries were carried into every country, that, without disturbing the popular beliefs, truth, the arts, and the sciences might be
known to those who were capable of understanding them, and maintaining the true doctrine incorrupt; which the people, prone to superstition and idolatry, have in no age been able to do; nor, as many
strange aberrations and superstitions of the present day prove, any more now than heretofore. For we need but point to the doctrines of so many sects that degrade the Creator to the rank, and assign to Him
the passions of humanity, to prove that now, as always, the old truths must be committed to a few, or they will be overlaid with fiction and error, and irretrievably lost.
Though Masonry is identical with the Ancient Mysteries, it is so in this qualified sense; that it presents
but an imperfect image of their brilliancy; the ruins only of their grandeur, and a system that has experienced progressive alterations, the limits of social events and political circumstances. Upon
leaving Egypt, the Mysteries were modified by the habits of the different nations among whom they were introduced.
Though originally more moral and political than religious, they soon became the heritage, as it were of
the priests, and essentially religious, though in reality limiting the sacerdotal power, by teaching the intelligent laity the folly and absurdity of the creeds of the populace.
They were therefore necessarily changed by the religious systems of the countries into which they were
transplanted. In Greece, they were the Mysteries of Ceres; in Rome, of Bona Dea, the Good Goddess; in Gaul, the School of Mars; in Sicily, the Academy of the Sciences; among the Hebrews, they partook
of the rites and ceremonies of a religion which placed all the powers of government, and all the knowledge, in the hands of the Priests and Levites. The pagodas of India, the retreats of the Magi of
Persia and Chaldea, and the pyramids of Egypt, were no longer the sources at which men drank in knowledge. Each people, at all informed, had its Mysteries. After a time the Temples of Greece and the
School of Pythagoras lost their reputation, and Freemasonry took their place Masonry, when properly expounded, is at once the interpretation of the great book of nature, the recital of physical and
astronomical phenomena, the purest philosophy, and the place of deposit, where, as in a Treasury, are

kept in safety all the great truths of the primitive revelation, that form the basis of all religions. In the modern Degrees three things are to he recognized: The image of primeval times, the tableau of the
efficient causes of the Universe, and the book in which are written the morality of all peoples, and the code by which they must govern themselves if they would be prosperous.
The Kabalistic doctrine was long the religion of the Sage and the Savant; because, like Freemasonry, it
incessantly tends toward spiritual perfection, and the fusion of the creeds and Nationalities of Mankind. In the eyes of the Kabalist, all men are his brothers; and their relative ignorance is, to him, but a reason
for instructing them. There were illustrious Kabalists among the Egyptians and Greeks, whose doctrines the Orthodox Church has accepted; and among the Arabs were many, whose wisdom was not
slighted by the Mediaeval Church.
The Sages proudly wore the name of Kabalists. The Kabalah embodied a noble philosophy, pure, not mysterious, but symbolic. It taught the doctrine of the Unity of God, the art of knowing and explaining
the essence and operations of the Supreme Being, of spiritual powers and natural forces, and of determining their action by symbolic figures; by the arrangement of the alphabet, the combinations of
numbers, the inversion of letters in writing and the concealed meanings which they claimed to discover therein. The Kabalah is the key of the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists.
The science of numbers represented not only arithmetical qualities, but also all grandeur, all proportion.
By it we necessarily arrive at the discovery of the Principle or First Cause of things, called at the present day THE ABSOLUTE.
Or UNITY, that loftiest term to which all philosophy directs itself; that imperious necessity of the
human mind, that pivot round which it is compelled to group the aggregate of its ideas, Unity, this source, this centre of all systematic order, this principle of existence, this central point, unknown in its
essence, but manifest in its effects; Unity, that sublime centre to which the chain of causes necessarily ascends, was the august Idea toward which all the ideas of Pythagoras converged. He refused the title of
Sage, which means one who knows. He invented, and applied to himself that of Philosopher, signifying one who is fond of or studies things secret and occult. The astronomy which he mysteriously taught,
was astrology: his science of numbers was based on Kabalistical principles.
The Ancients, and Pythagoras himself, whose real principles have not been always understood, never meant to ascribe to numbers, that is to say, to abstract signs, any special virtue. But the Sages of
Antiquity concurred in recognizing a ONE FIRST CAUSE (material or spiritual) of the existence of the Universe. Thence, UNITY became the symbol of the Supreme Deity. It was made to express, to
represent God; but without attributing to the mere number ONE any divine or supernatural virtue.

[The Rabbi (President of the Sanhedrim) adds: "From all that you have said, it results that the unit
develops itself in 2, is completed in three internally, and so produces 4 externally; whence, through 6, 7, 8, 9, it arrives at 5, half of the spherical number 10, to ascend, passing through 11, to 12, and to raise

Ans.'. Zero, the emblem of chaos, formless mixture of the elements.
Qu.'. What do the four devices of the Degree signify?
Ans.'. That we are to hear, see, be silent, and enjoy our happiness.
The unit is the symbol of identity, equality, existence, conservation and general harmony; the Central
Fire, the Point within the Circle.
Two, or the duad, is the symbol of diversity, inequality, division, separation, and vicissitudes.
The figure 1 signifies the living man [a body standing upright] man being the only living being possessed of this faculty. Adding to it a head, we have the letter P, the sign of Paternity, Creative Power;
and with a further addition, R, signifying man in motion, going, Iens, Iturus.
The Duad is the origin of contrasts. It is the imperfect condition into which, according to the Pythagoreans, a being falls, when he detaches himself from the Monad, or God. Spiritual beings,
emanating from God, are enveloped in the duad, and therefore receive only illusory impressions.
As formerly the number ONE designated harmony, order, or the Good Principle (the ONE and ONLY GOD, expressed in Latin Solus, whence the words Sol, Soleil, symbol of this God), the number Two
expressed the contrary idea. There commenced the fatal knowledge of good and evil.
Everything double, false opposed to the single and sole reality, was expressed by the Binary number. It expressed also that state of contrariety in which nature exists, where everything is double; night and
day, light and darkness, cold and heat, wet and dry, health and sickness, error and truth, one and the other sex, etc. Hence the Romans dedicated the second month in the year to Pluto, the God of Hell, and
the second day of that month to the manes of the dead.
The number One, with the Chinese, signified unity, harmony order, the Good Principle, or God; Two, disorder, duplicity, falsehood. That people, in the earliest ages, based their whole philosophical system
on the two primary figures or lines, one straight and unbroken, and the other broken or divided into two; doubling which, by placing one under the other, and trebling by placing three under each other,
they made the four symbols and eight Koua; which referred to the natural elements, and the primary
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



455/641
principles of all things, and served symbolically or scientifically to express them. Plato terms unity and duality the original elements of nature, and first principles of all existence: and the oldest sacred book
of the Chinese says: "The Great First Principle has produced two equations and differences, or primary rules of existence; but the two primary rules or two oppositions, namely YN and YANG, or repose and
motion, have produced four signs symbols, and the four symbols have produced the eight KOUA or further combinations."
The interpretation of the Hermetic fables shows, among every ancient people, in their principal gods,
first, 1, the Creating Monad, then 3, then 3 times 3, 3 times 9, and 3 times 27. This triple progression has for its foundation the three ages of Nature, the Past, the Present, and the Future; or the three degrees
of universal generation Birth, Life, Death, Beginning, middle, end.
The Monad was male, because its action produces no change in itself, but only out of itself. It represented the creative principle.
The Duad, for a contrary reason, was female, ever changing by addition, subtraction, or multiplication.
It represents matter capable of form.
The union of the Monad and Duad produces the Triad, signifying the world formed by the creative principle out of matter. Pythagoras represented the world by the rightangled triangle, in which the
squares of the two shortest sides are equal, added together, to the square of the longest one; as the world, as formed, is equal to the cleative cause, and matter clothed with form.
The ternary is the first of the unequal numbers. The Triad, mysterious number, which plays so great a
part in the traditions of Asia and the philosophy of Plato, image of the Supreme Being, includes in itself the properties of the first two numbers. It was, to the Philosophers, the most excellent and favorite
number; a mysterious type, revered by all antiquity, and consecrated in the Mysteries; wherefore there are but three essential Degrees among Masons; who venerate, in the triangle, the most august mystery,
that of the Sacred Triad, object of their homage and study.
In geometry, a line cannot represent a body absolutely perfect. As little do two lines constitute a figure demonstratively perfect. But three lines form, by their junction, the TRIANGLE, or the first figure
regularly perfect; and this is why it has served and still serves to characterize The Eternal; Who, infinitely perfect in His nature, is, as Universal Creator, the first Being, and consequently the first
Perfection.
The Quadrangle or Square, perfect as it appears, being but the second perfection, can in no wise

456/641
represent God; Who is the first. It is to be noted that the name of God in Latin and French (Deus, Dieu), has for its initial the Delta or Greek Triangle. Such is the reason, among ancients and moderns, for the
consecration of tne Triangle, whose three sides are emblems of the three Kingdoms, or Nature, or God. In the centre is the Hebrew JOD, the Animating Spirit of Fire, the generative principle, represented by
the letter G., initial of the name of Deity in the languages of the North, and the meaning whereof is Generation.
The first side of the Triangle, offered to the study of the Apprentice, is the mineral kingdom,
symbolized by Tub.
The second side, the subject of the meditations of the Fellow Craft, is the vegetable kingdom, symbolized by Schib.'. (an ear of corn). In this reign begins the Generation of bodies; and this is why
the letter G, in its radiance, is presented to the eyes of the adept.
The third side, the study whereof is devoted to the animal kingdom, and completes the instruction of the Master, is symbolized by Mach (Son of putrefaction).
The figure 3 symbolizes the Earth. It is a figure of the terrestrial bodies. The 2, upper half of 3,
symbolizes the vegetable world, the lower half being hidden from our sight.
Three also referred to harmony, friendship, peace, concord, and temperance; and was so highly esteemed among the Pythagoreans that they called it perfect harmony.
Three, four, ten, and twelve were sacred numbers among the Etrurians, as they were among the Jews,
Egyptians, and Hindus.
The name of Deity, in many Nations, consisted of three letters among the Greeks,I.'.A.'. Q.'.; among the Persians, H.'.O.'.M.'. among the Hindus, AUM; among the Scandinavians, I.'.O.'.W.'. On the upright
Tablet of the King, discovered at Nimroud, no less than five of the thirteen names of the Great Gods consist of three letters each, ANU, SAN, YAV, BAR, and BEI,.
The quaternary is the most perfect number, and the root of other numbers, and of all things. The tetrad
expresses the first mathematical power. Four represents also the generative power, from which all combinations are derived. The Initiates considered it the emblem of Movement and the Infinite,
representing everything that is neither corporeal nor sensible.

Pythagoras communicated it to his disciples as a symbol of the Eternal and Creative Principle, under
the name of Quaternary, the Ineffable Name of God, which signifies Source of everything that has received existence; and which, in Hebrew, is composed of four letters.
In the Quaternary we find the first solid figure, the universal symbol of immortality, the pyramid. The
Gnostics claimed that the whole edifice of their science rested on a square whose angles were. Silence, Profundity, Intelligence, and Truth. For if the Triangle, figured by the number 3, forms the triangular
base of the pyramid, it is unity which forms its point or summit.
Lysias and Timaeus of Locria said that not a single thing could be named, which did not depend on the quaternary as its root.
There is, according to the Pythagoreans, a connection between the gods and numbers, which constitutes
the kind of Divination called Arithmomancy. The soul is a number, it is moved of itself, it contains in itself the quaternary number.
Matter being represented by the number 9, or 3 times 3, and the Immortal Spirit having for its essential
hieroglyphic the quaternary or the number 4, the Sages said that Man, having gone astray and become entangled in an inextricable labyrinth, in going from four to nine, the only way which he could take to
emerge from these deceitful paths, these disastrous detours, and the abyss of evil into which he had plunged, was to retrace his steps, and go from nine to four.
The ingenious and mystical idea which caused the Triangle to be venerated, was applied to the figure 4
(4). It was said that it expressed a living being, I, bearer of the Triangle, the emblem of God; i. e., man bearing with himself a Divine principle.
Four was a divine number; it referred to the Deity, and many Ancient Nations gave God a name of four
letters; as the Hebrews, the Egyptians AMUN, the Persians SURA, the Greeks, and the Latins DEUS. This was the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrews, and the Pythagoreans called it Tetractys, and swore their
most solemn oath by it. So too ODIN among the Scandinavians, ZEYS among the Greeks, PHTA among the Egyptians, THOTH among the Phoenicians, and ASUR and NEBO among the Assyrians.
The list might be indefinitely extended.
The number 5 was considered as mysterious, because it was compounded of the Binary, Symbol of the False and Double, and the Ternary, so interesting in its results. It thus energetically expresses the state

458/641
of imperfection, of order and disorder of happiness and misfortune, of life and death, which we see upon the earth. To the Mysterious Societies it offered the fearful image of the Bad Principle, bringing
trouble into the inferior order, in a word, the Binary acting in the Ternary.
Under another aspect it was the emblem of marriage; because it is composed of 2, the first equal number, and of 3, the first unequal number. Wherefore Juno, the Goddess of Marriage, had for her
hieroglyphic the nwnber 5.
Moreover, it has one of the properties of the number 9, that of reproducing itself, when multiplied by itself: there being always a 5 on the right hand of the product; a result which led to its use as a symbol
of material changes.
The ancients represented the world by the number 5. A reason for it, given by Diodorus, is, that it represents earth, water, a fire, and ether or spirit. Thence the origin of (5) and the Universe, as the
whole.
The number 5 designated the universal quintessence, and Symbolized, by its form the vital essence, the animating spirit which flows [serpentat] through all nature. In fact, this ingenious figure is the union of
the two Greek accents'', placed over those vowels which ought to be or ought not to be aspirated. The first sign bears the name of potent spirit; and signifies the Superior Spirit, the Spirit of God aspirated
(spiratus), respired by man. The second sign is styled mild spirit, and represents the secondary spirit, the spirit purely human.
The triple triangle, a figure of five lines uniting in five points, was among the Pythagoreans an emblem
of Health.
It is the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, or Pentangle of Solomon; has five lines and five angles; and is, among Masons, the outline or origin of the fivepointed Star, and an emblem of Fellowship.
The number 6 was, in the Ancient Mysteries, a striking emblem of nature; as presenting the six
dimensions of all bodies: the six lines which make up their form, viz, the four lines of direction, toward the North, South, East, and West; with the two lines of height and depth, responding to the zenith and
nadir. The sages applied the senary to the physical man; while the septenary was, for them, the symbol of his immortal spirit.
The hieroglyphical senary (the double equilateral triangle) the symbol of Deity.

459/641
Six is also an emblem of health, and the symbol of justic; because it is the first perfect number; that is,
the first whose aliquot parts (1/2, 1/3, 1/6, or 3, 2, and 1), added together, make itself.
Ormuzd created six good spirits, and Ahriman six evil ones. These typify the six Summer and the six Winter months.
No number has ever been so universally in repute as the septenary. Its celebrity is due, no doubt, to the
planets being seven in number. It belongs also to sacred things. The Pythagoreans regarded it as formed of the numbers 3 and 4; the first whereof was, in their eyes, the image of the three material elements,
and the second the principle of everything that is neither corporeal nor sensible. It presented them, from that point of view, the emblem of everything that is perfect.
Considered as composed of 6 and unity, it serves to designate the invisible centre or soul of everything;
because no body exists, of which six lines do not constitute the form, nor without a seventh interior point, as the centre and reality of the body, whereof the external dimensions give only the appearance.
The numerous applications of the septenary confirmed the ancient sages in the use of this symbol.
Moreover, they exalted the properties of the number 7, as having, in a subordinate manner, the perfection of the unit; for if the unit is uncreated, if no number produces it, the seven is also not
engendered by any number contained in the interval between 1 and 10. The number 4 occupies an arithmetical middleground between the unit and 7, inasmuch as it is as much over 1, as it is under 7, the
difference each way being 3.
The number 7, among the Egyptians, symbolized life; and this is why the letter Z of the Greeks was the initial of the verb I live; and Jupiter, Father of Life.
The number 8, or the octary, is composed of the sacred numbers 3 and 5. Of the heavens, of the seven
planets, and of the sphere of the fixed stars, or of the eternal unity and the mysterious number 7, is composed the ogdoade, the number 8, the first cube of equal numbers, regarded as sacred in the
arithmetical philosophy.
The Gnostic ogdoade had eight stars, which represented the eight Cabiri of Samothrace, the eight Egyptian and Phoenician principles, the eight gods of Xenocrates, the eight angles of the cubic stone.

The number eight symbolizes perfection and its figure, 8 or (infinity) indicates the perpetual and regular course of the Universe.
It is the first cube (2 X 2 X 2), and signifies friendship prudence, counsel, and justice. It was a symbol
of the primeval law which regarded all men as equal.
The novary, or triple ternary. If the number three was celebrated among the ancient sages, that of three times three had no less celebrity; because, according to them, each of the three elements which
constitute our bodies is ternary, the water containing earth and fire; the earth containing igneous and aqueous particles; and the fire being tempered by globules of water terrestrial corpuscles which serve to
feed it. No one of the three elements being entirely separated from the others, all material beings composed of these three elements, whereof each is triple, may be designated by the figurative number
of three times three, which has become the symbol of all formations of bodies. Hence the name of ninth envelope, given to matter. Every material extension, every circular line, has for representative sign the
number nine, among the Pythagoreans; who had observed the property which this number possesses, of reproducing itself incessantly and entire, in every multiplication; thus offering to the mind a very
striking emblem of matter which is incessantly composed before our eyes, after having undergone a thousand decompositions.
The number nine was consecrated to the Spheres and the Muses. It is the sign of every circumference;
because a circle of 360 degrees is equal to 9, that is to say, 3 + 6 + 0 = 9. Nevertheless, the ancients regarded this number with a sort of terror: they considered it a bad presage; as the symbol of versatility,
of change and the emblem of the frailty of human affairs. Wherefore they avoided all numbers where nine appears, and chiefly 81, the product of 9 multiplied by itself, and the addition whereof, 8 + 1, again
presents the number 9.
As the figure of the number 6 was the symbol of the terrestrial globe, animated by a divine spirit, the figure of the number 9 symbolized the earth, under the influence of the Evil Principle thence the terror
it inspired. Nevertheless, according to Kabalists, the figure 9 symbolizes the generative egg, or the image of a little globular being, from whose lower side seems to flow its spirit of life.
The Ennead, signifying an aggregate of 9 things or persons, is the first square of unequal numbers.
Every one is aware of the singular properties of the number 9, which, multiplied by itself or any other
number whatever, gives a result whose final sum is always 9, or always divisible by 9.
Nine, multiplied by each of the ordinary numbers, produces an arithmetical progression, each member

whereof, composed of two figures, presents a remarkable fact; for example:
1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9..10
9..18..27..36..45..54..63..72..81..90
The first line of figures gives the regular series, from 1 to 10.
The second reproduces this line doubly; first ascending, from the first figure of 18, and then returning
from the second figure of 81.
It follows, from the curious fact, that the half of the numbers which compose this progression represents, in inverse order, the figures of the second half:
9...18..27..36..45 = 135 = 9 and 1 + 3 + 5 = 45 =9
90..81..72..63..54 = 360 = 9 99 99 99 99 99 495 = 18 = 9.
So 9^2 = 81
81^2 = 6561 = 18 = 9
9 X 2 = 18
18^2 = 324 = 9
9 X 3 = 27
27^2 = 729 = 18 = .9 9 X 4 = 36
36^2=1296 = 18 = 9
And so with every multiple of 9 say 45, 54, 63, 72, etc.
Thus 9 X 8 = 72. . .72^2 = 5184 = 18 = 9.
And further:

The number 10, or the Denary, is the measure of eveything and reduces multiplied numbers to unity.
Containing all the numerical and harmonic relations, and all the properties of numbers which precede it, it concludes the Abacus or Table Pythagoras. To the Mysterious Societies, this number typified the
assemblage of all the wonders of the Universe. They wrote it thus (theta), that is to say, Unity in the middle of Zero, as the centre of a circle, or symbol of Deity. They saw in this figure everything that
should lead to reflection; the centre, the ray, and the circumference, represented to them God, Man, and the Universe.
This number was, among the Sages, a sign of concord, love, and peace. To Masons it is a sign of union
and good faith; because it is expressed by joining two hands, or the Master's grip, when the number of fingers gives 10 and it was represented by the Tetractys of Pythagoras.
The number 12, like the number 7, is celebrated in the worship of nature. The two most famous
divisions of the heavens, that by 7, which is that of the planets, and that by 12, which is that of the Signs of the Zodiac, are found upon the religious monuments of all the peoples of the Ancient World, even to
the remote extremes of the East. Although Pythagoras does not speak the number 12, it is none the less a sacred number. It is image of the Zodiac; and consequently that of the Sun, which rules over it.
Such are the ancient ideas in regard to those numbers which so often appear in Masonry; and rightly
understood, as the old Sages understood them, they contain many a pregnant lesson.

464/641
Before we enter upon the final lesson of Masonic Philosophy, we will delay a few moments to repeat to you the Christian interpretations of the Blue Degrees.
In the First Degree, they said, there are three symbols to be applied.
1st. Man, after the fall, was left naked and defenceless against the just anger of the Deity. Prone to evil,
the human race staggered blindly onward into the thick darkness of unbelief, bound fast by the strong cabletow of the natural and sinful will. Moral corruption was followed by physical misery. Want and
destitution invaded the earth. War and Famine and Pestilence filled up the measure of evil, and over the sharp flints of misfortune and wretchedness man toiled with naked and bleeding feet. This condition of
blindness, destitution, misery, and bondage, from which to save the world the Redeemer came, is symbolized by the condition of the candidate, when he is brought up for the first time to the door of the
Lodge.
2nd. Notwithstanding the death of the Redeemer, man can be saved only by faith, repentance, and reformation. To repent, he must feel the sharp sting of conscience and remorse, like a sword piercing his
bosom. His confidence in his guide, whom he is told to follow and fear no danger; his trust in God, which he is caused to profess; and the point of the sword that is pressed against his naked left breast
over the heart, are symbolical of the faith, repentance and reformation necessary to bring him to the light of a life in Christ the Crucified.
3rd. Having repented and reformed, and bound himself to the service of God by a firm promise and
obligation, the light of Christian hope shines down into the darkness of the heart of the humble penitent, and blazes upon his pathway to Heaven. And this is symbolized by the candidate's being
brought to light, after he is obligated, by the Worshipful Master, who in that is a symbol of the Redeemer, and so brings him to light, with the help of the brethren, as He taught the Word with the aid
of the Apostles.
In the Second Degree there are two symbols:
4th. The Christian assumes new duties toward God and his fellows. Toward God, of love, gratitude, and veneration, and an anxious desire to serve and glorify Him; toward his fellows, of kindness, sympathy,
and justice. And this assumption of duty this entering upon good works, is symbolized by the Fellow Craft's obligation; by which, bound as an apprentice to secrecy merely, and set in the Northeast corner
of the Lodge, he descends as a FellowCraft into the body of the brethren, and assumes the active duties of a good Mason.

465/641
5th. The Christian, reconciled to God, sees the world in a new light. This great Universe is no longer a mere machine, wound up and set going six thousand or sixty millions years ago, and left to run on
afterward forever, by virtue of a law of mechanics created at the beginning, without further care or consideration on the part of the Deity; but it has now become to him a great emanation from God, the
product of His thought, not a mere dead machine, but a thing of life, over which God watches continually, and every movement of which is immediately produced by His present action, the law of
harmony being the essence of the Deity, reenacted every instant. And this is symbolized by the imperfect instruction given in the FellowCraft's Degree, in the sciences, and particularly geometry,
connected as the latter is with God Himself in the mind of a Mason, because the same letter, suspended in the East, represents both; and astronomy, or the knowledge of the laws of motion and harmony that
govern the spheres, is but a portion of the wider science of geometry. It is so symbolized, because it is here, in the Second Degree, that the candidate first receives an other than moral instruction.
There are also two symbols in the Third Degree, which with the 3 in the first, and 2 in the second, make
the 7.
6th. The candidate, after passing through the first part of the ceremony, imagines himself a Master; and is surprised to be informed that as yet he is not, and that it is uncertain whether he ever will be. He is
told of a difficult and dangerous path yet to be travelled, and is advised that upon that journey it depends whether he will become a Master. This is symbolical of that which our Saviour said to
Nicodemus, that notwithstanding his morals might be beyond reproach, he could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he were born again; symbolically dying, and again entering the world regenerate, like
a spotless infant.
7th. The murder of Hiram, his burial, and his being raised again by the Master, are symbols, both of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Redeemer; and of the death and burial in sins of the natural man,
and his being raised again to a new life, or born again, by the direct action of the Redeemer; after Morality (symbolized by the Entered Apprentice's grip), and Philosophy (symbolized by the grip of the
FellowCraft), had failed to raise him. That of the Lion of the House of Judah is the strong grip, never to be broken, with which Christ, of the royal line of that House, has clasped to Himself the whole
human race, and embraces them in His wide arms as closely and affectionately as brethren embrace each other on the five points of fellowship.
As Entered Apprentices and FellowCrafts, Masons are taught to imitate the laudable example of those
Masons who labored at the building of King Solomon's Temple; and to plant firmly and deep in their hearts those foundationstones of principle, truth, justice, temperance, fortitude, prudence, and charity,
on which to erect that Christian character which all the storms of misfortune and all the powers and temptations of Hell shall not prevail against; those feelings and noble affections which are the most
proper homage that can be paid to the Grand Architect and Great Father of the Universe, and which

make the heart a living temple builded to Him; when the unruly passions are made to submit to rule and measurement, and their excesses are struck off with the gavel of selfrestraint; and when every action
and every principle is accurately corrected and adjusted by the square of wisdom, the level of humility, and the plumb of justice.
The two columns, Jachin and Boaz, are the symbols of that profound faith and implicit trust in God and
the Redeemer that are the Christian's strength; and of those good works by which alone that faith can be established and made operative and effectual to salvation.
The three pillars that support the Lodge are symbols of a Christian's HOPE in a future state of
happiness; FAITH in the promises and the divine character and mission of the Redeemer; and CHARITABLE JUDGMENT of other men.
The three murderers of KhirOm symbolize Pontius Pilate, Caiaphas the HighPriest, and Judas
Iscariot: and the three blows given him are the betrayal by the last, the refusal of Roman protection by Pilate, and the condemnation by the HighPriest. They also symbolize the blow on the ear, the
scourging, and the crown of thorns. The twelve fellowcrafts sent in search of the body are the twelve disciples, in doubt whether to believe that the Redeemer would rise from the dead.
The Master's word, supposed to be lost, symbolizes the Christian faith and religion, supposed to have
been crushed and destroyed when the Saviour was crucified, after Iscariot had betrayed Him, and Peter deserted Him, and when the other disciples doubted whether He would arise from the dead; but which
rose from His tomb and flowed rapidly over the civilized world; and so that which was supposed to be lost was found. It symbolizes also the Saviour Himself; the WORD that was in the beginning that was
with God, and that was God; the Word of life, that was made flesh and dwelt among us, and was supposed to be lost, while He lay in the tomb, for three days, and His disciples "as yet knew not the
scripture that He must rise again from the dead," and doubted when they heard of it, and were amazed and frightened and still doubted when He appeared among them.
The bush of acacia placed at the head of the grave of KhirOm is an emblem of resurrection and
immortality.
Such are the explanations of our Christian brethren; entitled, like those of all other Masons, to a respectful consideration.
CLOSING INSTRUCTION
Ebook brought to you by League of Extraordinary Gentlemen



467/641
There is no pretence to infallibility in Masonry. It is not for us to dictate to any man what he shall
believe. We have hitherto, in the instruction of the several Degrees, confined ourselves to aying before you the great thoughts that have found expression in the different ages of the world, leaving you to
decide for yourself as to the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of each, and what proportion of truth, if any, each contained.
We shall pursue no other course in this closing Philosophical instruction; in which we propose to deal
with the highest questions that have ever exercised the human mind, with the existence and the nature of a God, with the existence and the natnre of the human soul, and with the relations of the divine and
human spirit with the merely material Universe. There can be no questions more important to an intelligent being, none that have for him a more direct and personal interest; and to this last word of
Scottish Masonry we invite your serious and attentive consideration. And, as what we shall now say will be but the completion and roundingoff of what we have already said in several of the preceding
Degrees, in regard to the Old Thought and the Ancient Philosophies, we hope that you have noted and not forgotten our previous lessons, without which this would seem imperfect and fragmentary.
In its idea of rewarding a faithful and intelligent workman by conferring upon him a knowledge of the
True Word, Masonry has perpetuated a very great truth, because it involves the proposition that the idea which a man forms of God is always the most important element in his speculative theory of the
Universe, and in his particular practical plan of action for the Church, the State, the community, the Family, and his own individual life. It will ever make a vast difference in the conduct of a people in war
or peace, whether they believe the Supreme God to be a cruel Deity, delighting in sacrifice and blood, or a God of Love; and an individual's speculative theory as to the mode and extent of God's
government, and as to the nature and reality of his own freewill and consequent responsibility, will needs; have great influence in shaping the course of his life and conversation.
We see every day the vast influence of the popular idea of God. All the great historical civilizations of
the race have grown out of the national ideas which were formed of God; or have been intimately connected with those ideas. The popular Theology, which at first is only an abstract idea in the heads of
philosophers, by and by shows itself in the laws, and in the punishments for crime, in the churches, the ceremonies and the sacraments, the festivals and the fasts, the weddings, the baptisms and the funerals,
in the hospitals, the colleges, the schools, and all the social charities, in the relations of husband and wife, parent and child, in the daily work and the daily prayer of every man.
As the world grows in its development, it necessarily outgrows its ancient ideas of God, which were
only temporary and provisional. A man who has a higher conception of God than those about him, and who denies that their conception is God, is very likely to be called an Atheist by men who are really far
less believers in a God than he. Thus the Christians, who said the Heathen idols were no Gods, were

468/641
accounted Atheists by the People, and accordingly put to death; and Jesus of Nazareth was crucified as an unbelieving blasphemer, by the Jews.
There is a mere formal Atheism, which is a denial of God in terms, but not in reality. A man says, There
is no God; that is, no God that is selforiginated, or that never originated, but always WAS and HAD BEEN, who is the cause of existence, who is the Mind and the Providence of the Universe; and so the
order, beauty, and harmony of the world of matter and mind do not indicate any plan or purpose of Deity. But, he says, NATURE, meaning by that the whole sumtotal of existence, that is powerful,
active, wise, and good; Nature is selforiginated, or always was and had been, the cause of its own existence, the mind of the Universe and the Providence of itself. There is obviously a plan and purpose
whereby order, beauty, and harmony are brought about; but all that is the plan and purpose of nature.
In such cases, the absolute denial of God is only formal and not real. The qualities of God are admitted, and claimed to be real and it is a mere change of name to call the possessor of those qualities, Nature,
and not God. The real question is, whether such Qualities exist, as we call God; and not, by what particular name we shall designate the Qualities. One man may call the sum total of these Qualities,
Nature; another, Heaven; a third, Universe, a fourth, Matter; a fifth, Spirit; a sixth, God, Theos, Zeus, Alfadir, Allah, or what he pleases. All admit the existence of the Being, Power, or ENS, thus diversely
named. The name is of the smallest consequence.
Real Atheism is the denial of the existence of any God, of the actuality of all possible ideas of God. It denies that there any Mind, Intelligence, or ENS, that is the Cause and Providence of the Universe, and
of any Thing or any Existence, Soul, Spirit, or Being, that intentionally or intelligently produces the Order, Beauty, and Harmony thereof, and the constant and regular modes of operation therein. It must
necessarily deny that there is any law, order, or harmony in existence, or any constant mode of operation in the world; for it is utterly impossible for any human creature to conceive, however much he
may pretend to do so, of either of these, except as a consequence of the action of Intelligence; which is, indeed, that otherwise unknown thing, the existence of which these alone prove; otherwise than as the
cause of these, not a thing at all; a mere name for the wholly uncognizable cause of these.
The real atheist must deny the existence of the Qualities of God, deny that there is any mind of or in the Universe, any selfconscious Providence, any Providence at all. He must deny that there is any Being or
Cause of Finite things, that is selfconsciously powerful, wise, just, loving, and faithful to itself and its own nature. He must deny that there is any plan in the Universe or any part of it. He must hold, either
that matter is eternal, or that it originated itself, which is absurd, or that it was originated by an Intelligence, or at least by a Cause; and then he admits a God. No doubt it is beyond the reach of our
faculties to imagine how matter originated, how it began to be, in space where before was nothing, or God only. But it is equally beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine it eternal and unoriginated. To
hold it to be eternal, without thought or will; that the specific forms of it, the seed, the rock, the tree,

the man, the solar system, all came with no forethought planning or producing them, by "chance" or "the fortuitous concourse of atoms" of matter that has no thought or will; and that they indicate no
mind, no plan, no purpose, no providence, is absurd. It is not to deny the existence of what we understand by mind, plan, purpose, Providence; but to insist that these words shall have some other
meaning than that which the human race has ever attached to them shall mean some unknown thing, for which the human race has no name, because it has of such a thing nopossible idea. Either there never
was any such thing as a "plan," and the word is nonsense, or the Universe exists in conformity to a plan. The word never meant, and never can mean, any other thing than that which the Universe exhibits. So
with the word "purpose;" so with the word "Providence." They mean nothing, or else only what the Universe proves.
It was soon found that the denial of a Conscious Power, the cause of man and of his life, of a
Providence, or a Mind and Intelligence arranging man in reference to the world, and the world in reference to man, would not satisfy the instinctive desires of human nature, or account for the facts of
material nature. It did not long answer to say, if it ever was said, that the Universe was drifting in the void inane, and neither it, nor any mind within or without it, knew of its whence, its whither, or its
whereabouts; that man was drifting in the Universe, knowing little of his whereabouts, nothing of his whence or whither; that there was no Mind, no Providence, no Power, that knew any better; nothing that
guided and directed man in his drifting, or the Universe in the weltering waste of Time. To say to man and woman, "your heroism, your bravery, your selfdenial all comes to nothing; your nobleness will do
you no good you will die, and your nobleness will do mankind no service; for there is no plan or order in all these things; everything comes and goes by the fortuitous concourse of atoms; "did not, nor ever
will, long satisfy the human mind.
True, the theory of Atheism has been uttered. It has been said: "Death is the end; this is a world without a God; you are a body without a soul; there is a Here, but no Hereafter for you; a Earth, but no Heaven.
Die, and return to your dust. Man is bones, blood, bowels, and brain; mind is matter; there is no soul in the brain, nothing but nerves. We can see all the way to a little star in the nebula of Orion's belt; so
distant that it will take light a thousand millions of years to come from it to the earth, journeying at the rate of twelve millions of miles a minute. There is no Heaven this side of that; you see all the way
through; there is not a speck of Heaven; and do you think there is any beyond it; and if so, when would you reach it? There is no Providence. Nature is a forfuitous concourse of atoms; though is a fortuitous
function of matter, a fortuitous result of a for tuitous result, a chanceshot from the great windgun of the Universe, accidentally loaded, pointed at random, and fired off by chance. Things happen; they are
not arranged. There is luck, and there is illluck; but there is no Providence. Die you into dust!"
Does all this satisfy the human instinct of immortality, that makes us ever long, with unutterable longing, to join our selves again to our dear ones who have gone away before us, an to mankind, for
eternal life? Does it satisfy our mighty hungering and thirst for immortality, our anxious longing to come nearer to, and to know more of, the Eternal Cause of all things?

Men never could be content to believe that there was no mind that thought for man, no conscience to
enact eternal laws, no hear to love those whom nothing of earth loves or cares for, no will of the Universe to marshal the nations in the way of wisdom, justic and lowe. History is not thank God, we
know it is not the fortuitous concourse of events, or Nature that of atoms. We can not believe that there is no plan nor purpose in Nature, to guid our going out and coming in: that there is a mighty going, but
goes nowhere; that all beauty, wisdom, affection, justice, morality in the world, is an accident, and may end tomorrow.
All over the world there is heroism unrequited, or paid with misery; vice on thrones, corruption in high
places, nobleness in poverty or even in chains, the gentle devotion of woman rewarded by brutal neglect or more brutal abuse and violence; everywhere want, misery, overwork, and underwages. Add to these
the Atheist's creed, a body without a soul, an earth without Heaven, a world without a God; and what a Pandemonium would we make of this world!
The intellect of the Atheist would find matter everywhere; but no Causing and Providing Mind: his
moral sense would find no Equitable Will, no Beauty of Moral Excellence, no Conscience enacting justice into the unchanging law of right, no spiritual Order or spiritual Providence, but only material
Fate and Chance. His affections would find only finite things to love; and to them the dead who were loved and who died yesterday, are like the rainbow that yesterday evening lived a moment and then
passed away. His soul, flying through the vast Inane, and feeling the darkness with its wings, seeking the Soul of all, which at once is Reason, Conscience, and the Heart of all that is, would find no God,
but a universe all disorder; no Infinite, no Reason, no Conscience, no Heart, no Soul of things; nothing to reverence, to esteem, to love, to worship, to trust in; but only an Ugly Force, alien and foreign to us,
that strikes down those we love, and makes us mere worms on the hot sand of the world.
No voice would speak from the Earth to comfort him. It is a cruel mother, that great Earth, that devours her young, a Force and nothing more. Out of the sky would smile no kind Providence, in all its
thousand starry eyes; and in storms a malignant violence, with its lightningsword, would stab into the darkness, seeking for men to murder.
No man ever was or ever can be content with that. The evidence of God has been ploughed into Nature
so deeply, and so deeply woven into the texture of the human soul, that Atheism has never become a faith, though it has sometimes assumed the shape of theory. Religion is natural to man.

the evidences of a Design, a Will, an Intelligence, and a God, of a God beneficent and loving as well as wise, and merciful and indulgent as well as powerful.
To man, surrounded by the material Universe, and conscious of the influence that his material
environments exercised upon his fortunes and his present destiny; to man, ever confronted with the splendors of the starry heavens, the regular march of the seasons, the phenomena of sunrise and
moonrise, and all evidences of intelligence and design that everywhere presse upon and overwhelmed him, all imaginable questions as to the nature and cause of these phenomena constantly recurred,
demanding to be solved, and refusing to be sent away unanswered. And still, after the lapse of ages, press upon the human min and demand solution, the same great questions perhaps still demanding it in
vain.
Advancing to the period when man had ceased to look upon the separate parts and individual forces of the Universe as gods; when he had come to look upon it as a whole, this question, among the earliest,
occurred to him, and insisted on being answered: "Is this material Universe selfexistent, or was it created? Is it eternal, or did it originate?"
And then in succession came crowding on the human mind these other questions:
"Is this material Universe a mere aggregate of fortuitous combinations of matter, or is it the result and
work of intelligen acting upon a plan?
"If there be such an Intelligence, what and where is it? Is material Universe itself an Intelligent being? Is it like man, body and a soul? Does Nature act upon itself, or is there a Cause beyond it that acts upon
it?
"If there is a personal God, separate from the material Universe, that created all things, Himself uncreated, is He corporeal or incorporeal, material or spiritual, the soul of the Universe or wholly apart
from it and if He be Spirit, what then is spirit?
"Was that Supreme Deity active or quiescent before the creation; and if quiescent during a previous eternity, what necess of His nature moved Him at last to create a world; or was it a mere whim that had
no motive?
"Was matter coexistent with Him, or absolutely created him out of nothing? Did He create it, or only mould and shape and fashion a chaos already existing, coexistent with Himself?

472/641
"Did the Deity directly create matter, or was creation the work of inferior deities, emanations from
Himself?
"If He be good and just, whence comes it that, foreknowing everything, He has allowed sorrow and evil to exist; and how to reconcile with His benevolence and wisdom the prosperity of vice and the
misfortunes of virtue in this world?"
And then, as to man himself, recurred these other questions, as they continue to recur to all of us:
"What is it in us that thinks? Is Thought the mere result of material organization; or is there in us a soul that thinks, separate from and resident in the body? If the latter, is it eternal and uncreated; and if not,
how created? Is it distinct from God, or an emanation from Him? Is it inherently immortal, or only so by destination, because God has willed it? Is it to return to and be merged in Him, or ever to exist,
separately from Him, with its present identity?
"If God has foreseen and forearranged all that occurs, how has man any real freewill, or the least control over circumstances? How can anything be done against the will of Infinite Omnipotence and if
all is done according to that will, how is there any wrong or evil, in what Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Power does not choose to prevent?
"What is the foundation of the moral law? Did God enact it of His own mere pleasure; and if so, can He
not, when He pleases, repeal it? Who shall assure us He will not repeal it, and make right wrong, and virtue vice? Or is the moral law a necessity of His nature and if so, who enacted it and does not that
assert a power, like the old Necessity, superior to Deity?"
And, close following after these, came the great question of HEREAFTER, of another Life, of the soul's Destiny; and the thousand other collateral and subordinate questions, as to matter, spirit, futurity,
and God, that have produced all the systems of philosophy, all metaphysics, and all theology, since the world began.
What the old philosophic mind thought upon these great questions, we have already, to some extent,
developed. With the Emanationdoctrine of the Gnostics and the Orient, we have endeavored to make you familiar. We have brought you face to face with the Kabalists, the Essenes, and Philo the Jew. We
have shown that, and how, much of the old mythology was derived from the daily and yearly recurring phenomena of the heavens. We have exhibited to you the ancient notions by which they endeavored to

473/641
explain to themselves the existence and prevalence of evil; and we have in some degree made known to you their metaphysical ideas as to the nature of the Deity. Much more remains to be done than it is
within our power to do. We stand upon the sounding shore of the great ocean of Time. In front of us stretches out the heaving waste of the illimitable Past; and its waves, as they roll up to our feet along the
sparking slope of the yellow sands, bring to us, nw and then, from the depths of that boundless ocean, a shell, a few specimens of algae torn rudely from their stems, a rounded pebble; and that is all; of all the
vast treasures of ancient thought that lie buried there, with the mighty anthem of the boundless ocean thundering over them forever and forever.
Let us once more, and for the last time, along the shore of that great ocean, gather a few more relics of
the Past, and listen to its mighty voices, as they come, in fragmentary music, in broken and interrupted rhythm, whispering to us from the great bosom of the Past.
Rites, creeds and legends express directly or symbolically, some leading idea, according to which the
Mysteries of Being are supposed to be explained in Deity. The intricacies of mythical genealogies are a practical acknowledgment of the mysterious nature of the Omnipotent Deity; displaying in their
beautiful but ineffectual imagery the first efforts of the mind to communicate with nature; the flowers which fancy strewed before the youthful steps of Psyche, when she first set out in pursuit of the
immortal object of her love. Theories and notions, in all their varieties of truth and falsehood, are a machinery more or less efficacious, directed to the same end. Every religion was, in its origin, an
embryo philosophy, or an attempt to interpret the unknown by mind and it was only when philosophy, which is essentially progress, outgrew its first acquisitions, that religion became a thing apart,
cherishing as unalterable dogmas the notions which philosophy had abandoned. Separated from philosophy, it became arrogant and fantastical, professing to have already attained what its more
authentic representative was ever pursuing in vain and discovering, through its initiations and Mysteries, all that to its contracted view seemed wanting to restore the wellbeing of mankind, the
means of purification and expiation, remedies for disease, expedients to cure the disorders of the soul, and to propitiate the gods.
Why should we attempt to confine the idea of the Supreme Mind within an arbitrary barrier, or exclude
from the limits of veracity any conception of the Deity, which, if imperfect and inadequate, may be only a little more so than our own? "The name of God," says Hobbes, "is used not to make us conceive Him,
or He is inconceivable, but that we may honor Him." "Believe in God, and adore Him," said the Greek Poet, "but investigate Him not; the inquiry is fruitless, seek not to discover who God is; for, by the
desire to know, you offend Him who chooses to remain unknown." "When we attempt," says Philo, "to investigate the essence of the Absolute Being, we fall into an abyss of perplexity; and the only benefit to
be derived from such researches is the conviction of their absurdity."
Yet man, though ignorant of the constitution of the dust on which he treads, has ventured, and still

474/641
ventures, to speculate on the nature of God, and to define dogmatically in creeds the subject least within the compass of his faculties; and even to hate and persecute those who will not accept his views
as true.
But though a knowledge of the Divine Essence is impossible, the conceptions formed respecting it are interesting, as indications of intellectual development. The history of religion is the history of the
human mind; and the conception formed by it of Deity is always in exact relation to its moral and intellectual attainments. The one is the index and the measure of the other.
The negative notion of God, which consists in abstracting the inferior and finite, is, according to Philo,
the only way in which it is possible for man worthily to apprehend the nature of God. After exhausting the varieties of symbolism, we contrast the Divine Greatness with human littleness, and employ
expressions apparently affirmative, such as "Infinite," "Almighty," "Allwise," "Omnipotent," "Eternal," and the like; which in reality amount only to denying, in regard to God, those limits which confine the
faculties of man; and thus we remain content with a name which is a mere conventional sign and confession of our ignorance.
The Hebrew and the Greek of GOD expressed abstract existence, without outward manifestation or
development. Of the same nature are the definitions, "God is a sphere whose centre is everywhere, and whose circumference nowhere"; "God is He who sees all, Himself unseen" and finally, that of Proclus
and Hegel; the "To that which has no outward and positive existence." Most of the so called ideas or definitions of the "Absoute" are only a collection of negations; from which, as they affirm nothing,
nothing is learned.
God was first recognized in the heavenly bodies and in the elements. When man's consciousness of his own intellectuality was matured, and he became convinced that the internal faculty of thought was
something more subtle than even the most subtle elements, he transferred that new conception to the object of his worship, and deified a mental principle instead of a physical one. He in every case makes
God after his own image; for do what we will, the highest efforts of human thought can conceive nothing higher than the supremacy of intellect; and so he ever comes back to some familiar type of
exalted humanity. He at first deifies nature, and afterward himself.
The eternal aspiration of the religious sentiment in man is to become united with God. In his earliest development, the wish and its fulfillment were simultaneous, through unquestioning belief. In
proportion as the conception of Deity was exalted, the notion of His terrestrial presence or proximity was abandoned and the difficulty of comprehending the Divine Government, together with the glaring
superstitious evils arising out of its misinterpretation, endangered the belief in it altogether.

Even the lights of Heaven, which, as "bright potentates of the sky," were formerly the vigilant directors of the economy of earth now shine dim and distant, and Uriel no more descends upon a sunbeam. But
the real change has been in the progressive ascent of man's own faculties, and not in the Divine Nature; as the Stars are no more distant now than when they were supposed to rest on the shoulders of Atlas.
And yet a little sense of disappointment and humiliation attended the first awakening of the soul, when reason, looking upward toward the Deity, was impressed with a dizzy sense of having fallen.
But hope revives in despondency; and every nation that ever advanced beyond the most elementary
conceptions, felt the necessity of an attempt to fill the chasm, real or imaginary, separating man from God. To do this was the great task of poetry, philosophy, and religion. Hence the personifications of
God's attributes, developments, and manifestations as "Powers", "Intelligences", "Angels", "Emanations" through which and the oracular faculty in himself, man could place himself in
communion with God.
The various ranks and orders of mythical beings imagined by Persians, Indians, Egyptians, or Etrurians, to preside over the various departments of nature, had each his share in a scheme to bring man into
closer approximation to the Deity; they eventually gave way only before an analogous though less picturesque symbolism and the Deities and Demons of Greece and Rome were perpetuated with only a
change of names, when their offices were transferred to Saints and Martyrs. The attempts by which reason had sometimes endeavored to span the unknown by a bridge of metaphysics, such as the
idealistic systems of Zoroaster, Pythagoras, or Plato, were only a more refined form of the poetical illusions which satisfied the vulgar and man still looked back with longing to the lost golden age, when
his ancestors communed face to face with the Gods and hoped that, by propitiating Heaven, he might accelerate the renewal of it in the islands of the Far West, under the sceptre of Kronos, or in a
centralization of political power at Jerusalem. His eager hope overcame even the terrors of the grave for the Divine power was as infinite as human expectation, and the Egyptian, duly ensepulchred in the
Lybian Catacombs, was supposed to be already on his way to the Fortunate Abodes under the guidance of Hermes, there to obtain a perfect association and reunion with his God.
Remembering what we have already said elsewhere in regard to the old ideas concerning the Deity, and
repeating it as little as possible, let us once more put ourselves in communion with the Ancient poetic and philosophic mind, and endeavor to learn of it what it thought, and how it solved the great problems
that have ever tortured the human intellect.
The division of the First and Supreme Cause into two parts, one Active and the other Passive, the Universe Agent and Patient, or the hermaphroditic GodWorld, is one of the most ancient and
widespread dogmas of philosophy or natural theology. Almost every ancient people gave it a place in their worship, their mysteries, and their ceremonies.

Ocellus Lucanus, who seems to have lived shortly after Pythagoras opened his School in Italy, five or six hundred years before our era, and in the time of Solon, Thales, and the other Sages who had studied
in the Schools of Egypt, not only recognizes the eternity of the Universe, and its divine character as an unproduced and indestructible being, but also the distinction of Active and Passive causes in what he
terms the Grand Whole, or the single hermaphroditic Being that comprehends all existences, as well causes as effects and which is a system regularly ordered, perfect and complete, of all Natures. He well
apprehended the dividing line that separates existence eternally the same, from that which eternally changes; the nature of celestial from that of terrestrial bodies, that of causes from that of effects, that
which is from that which only BECOMES, a distinction that naturally struck every thinking man.
We shall not quote his language at full length. The heavenly bodies, he thought, are first and most noble; they move of themselves, and ever revolve, without change of form or essence. Fire, water, earth,
and air change incessantly and continually, not place, but form. Then, as in the Universe there are generation and cause of generation, as generation is where there are change and displacement of parts,
and cause where there is stability of nature, evidently it belongs to what is the cause of generation, to move and to act and to the recipient, to be made and moved. In his view, everything above the Moon
was the habitation of the gods; all below, that of Nature and discord; this operates dissolution of things made; that, production of those that are being made. As the world is unproduced and indestnlctible, as it
had no beginning, and will have no end, necessarily the principle that operates generation in another than itself, and that which operates it in itself, have coexisted.
The former is all above the moon, and especially the sun; the latter is the sublunary world. Of these two
parts, one active, the other passive; one divine and always the same, the other mortal and ever changing, all that we call the "world" or "universe" is composed.
These accorded with the principles of the Egyptian philosophy, which held that man and the animals
had always existed together with the world; that they were its effects, eternal like itself. The chief divisions of nature into active and passive causes, its system of generation and destruction, and the
concurrence of the two great principles, Heaven and earth, uniting to form all things, will, according to Ocellus, always continue to exist.
"Enough" he concludes, "as to the Universe, the generations and destructions effected in it, the mode in
which it now exists, the mode in which it will ever exist, by the eternal qualities of the two principles, one always moving, the other always moved; one always governing, the other always governed."
Such is a brief summary of the doctrine of this philosopher, whose work is one of the most ancient that
has survived to us. The subject on which he treated occupied in his time all men's minds; the poets sang of cosmogonies and theogonies, and the philosophers wrote treatises on the birth of the world and the

elements of its composition. The cosmogony of the Hebrews, attributed to Moses; that of the Phoenicians, ascribed to Sanchoniathon; that of the Greeks, composed by Hesiod; that of the Egyptians,
the Atlantes, and the Cretans, preserved by Diodorus Siculus; the fragments of the theology of Orpheus, divided among different writers; the books of the Persians, or their Boundehesh; those of the
Hindus; the traditions of the Chinese and the people of Macassar; the cosmogonic chants which Virgil puts in the mouth of Iopas at Carthage and those of the old Silenus, the first book of the
Metamorphoses of Ovid; all testify to the aniquity and universality of these fictions as to the origin of the world and its causes.
At the head of the causes of nature, Heaven and earth were laced and the most apparent parts of each,
the sun, the moon, the fixed stars and planets, and, above all, the zodiac, among the active causes of generation; and among the passive, the several elements. These causes were not only classed in the
progressive order of their energy, Heaven and earth heading the respective lists, but distinct sexes were in some sort assigned to them, and characteristics analogous to the mode in which they concur in
universal generation.
The doctrine of Ocellus was the general doctrine everywhere, it naturally occurring to all to make the same distinction. The Egyptians did so, in selecting those animals in which they recogized these
emblematic qualities, in order to symbolize the double sex of the Universe. Their God KNEPH, out of whose mouth issued the Orphic egg, whence the author of the Clementine Recognitions makes a
hermaphroditic figure to emerge, uniting in itself the two principles whereof Heaven and the earth are forms, and which enter into the organization of all beings which the heavens and the earth engender by
their concourse, furnishes another emblem of the double power, active and passive, which the ancients saw in the Universe and which they symbolized by the egg. Orpheus, who studied in Egypt, borrowed
from the theologians of that country the mysterious forms under which the science of nature was veiled, and carried into Greece the symbolic egg, with its division into two parts or causes figured by the
hermaphroditic being that issued from it and whereof Heaven and earth are composed.
The Brahmins of India expressed the same cosmogonic idea by a statue, representative of the Universe, uniting in itself both sexes. The male sex offered an image of the sun, centre of the active principle, and
the female sex that of the moon, at the sphere whereof, proceeding downward, the passive portion of nature begins. The Lingam, unto the present day revered in the Indian temples, being but the
conjunction of the organs of generation of the two sexes, was an emblem of the same. The Hindus have ever had the greatest veneration for this symbol of everreproductive nature. The Greeks consecrated the
same symbols of universal fruitfulness in their Mysteries and they were exhibited in the sanctuaries of Eleusis.
They appear among the sculptured ornaments of all the Indian temples. Tertullian accuses the
Valentinians of having adopted the custom of venerating them; a custom, he says, introduced by

Melampus from Egypt into Greece. The Egyptians consecrated the Phallus in the Mysteries of Osiris and Isis, as we learn from Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus and the latter assures us that these emblems
were not consecrated by the Egyptians alone, but by every people. They certainly were so among the Persians and Assyrians; and they were regarded everywhere as symbolic of the generative and
productive powers of all animated beings. In those early ages, the works of Nature and all her agents were sacred like herself.
For the union of Nature with herself is a chaste marriage, of which the union of man and woman was a
natural image, all their organs were an expressive emblem of the double energy which manifests itself in Heaven and Earth uniting together to produce all beings. "The Heavens," says Plutarch, "seemed to
men to fulfill the functions of father, and the Earth of mother. The former impregnated the earth with its fertilizing rains, and the earth, receiving them, became fruitful and brought forth". Heaven, which
covers and embraces the earth everywhere, is her potent spouse, uniting himself to her to make her fruitful, without which she would languish in everlasting sterility, buried in the shades of chaos and of
night. Their union is their marriage their productions or parts are their children. The skies are our Father, and Nature the great Mother of us all.
This idea was not the dogma of a single sect, but the general opinion of all the Sages. "Nature was
divided," says Cicero, "into two parts, one active, and the other that submitted itself to this action, which it received, and which modified it. The former was deemed to be a Force, and the latter the
material on which that Force exerted itself". Macrobius repeated almost literally the doctrine of Ocellus. Aristotle termed the earth the fruitful mother, environed on all sides by the air. Above it was
Heaven, the dwellingplace of the gods and the divine stars, its substance ether, or a fire incessantly moving in circles, divine and incorruptible, and subject to no change. Below it, nature, and the
elements, nutable and acted on, corruptible and mortal.
Synesius said that generations were effected in the portions of the Universe which we inhabit; while the cause of generations resided in the portions above us, whence descend to us the germs of the effects
produced here below. Proclus and Simplicius deemed Heaven the Active Cause and Father, relatively to the earth. The former says that the World or the Whole is a single Animal; what is done in it, is done by
it; the same World acts, and acts upon itself. He divides it into "Heaven" and "Generation". In the former, he says, are placed and arranged the conservative causes of generation, superintended by the
Genii and Gods.
The Earth, or Rhea, associated ever with saturn in production, is mother of the effects of which Heaven is Father; the womb or bosom that receives the fertilizing energy of the God that engenders ages. The
great work of generation is operated, he says, primarily by the action of the Sun, and secondarily by that of the Moon, so that the Sun is the primitive source of this energy, as father and chief of the male gods
that form his court.

He follows the action of the male and female principles through all the portions and divisions of nature,
attributing to the former the origin of stability and identity, to the latter, that of diversity and mobility. Heaven is to the earth, he says, as the male to the female. It is the movement of the heavens that, by
their revolutions, furnished the seminal incitements and forces, whose emanations received by the earth, make it fruitful, and cause it to produce animals and plants of every kind.
Philo says that Moses recognized this doctrine of two causes, active and passive; but made the former
to reside in the Mind or Intelligence external to matter.
The ancient astrologers divided the twelve signs of the Zodiac into six male and six female, and assigned them to six male a six female Gods. Heaven and Earth, or Ouranos and Ghe, were among the
most ancient nations, the first and most ancient Divinities. We find them in the Phoenician history of Sanchoniathon, and in the Grecian Genealogy of the Gods given by Hesiod. Everywhere they marry,
and by their union produce the later Gods. "In the beginning." says Apollodorus, "Ouranos or the Heavens was Lord of all the Universe; he took to wife Ghe or the earth, and had by her many children".
They were the first Gods of the Cretans, and under other names, of the Armenians, as we learn from Berosus, and of Panchaia, an island South of Arabia, as we learn from Euhemerus. Orpheus made the
Divinity or the "Great Whole," male and female, because, he said, it could produce nothing, unless it united in itself the productive force of both sexes. He called Heaven PANGENETOR, the Father of all
things, most ancient of Beings, beginning and end of all, containing in Himself the incorruptible and unwearying force of Necessity.
The same idea obtained in the rude North of Europe. The Scythians made the earth to be the wife of
Jupiter; and the Germans adored her under the name of HERTA. The Celts worshipped the Heavens and the Earth, and said that without the former the latter would be sterile, and that their marriage
produced all things. The Scandinavians acknowledged BOR or the Heavens, and gave FURTUR, his son, the Earth as his wife. Olaus Rudbeck adds, that their ancestors were persuaded that Heaven
intermarried with the Earth, and thus uniting his forces with hers, produced animals and plants. This marriage of Heaven and Earth produced the Azes, Genii famous in the theology of the North. In the
theology of the Phrygians and Lydians, the ASII were born of the marriage of the Supreme God with the Earth, and Firmicus informs us that the Phrygians attrihuted to the Earth supremacy over the other
elements, and considered her the Great Mother of all things.
Virgil sings the impregnation of the joyous earth, by the Ether, its spouse, that descends upon its bosom, fertilizing it with rains. Columella sings the loves of Nature and her marriage with Heaven
annually consummated at the sweet Springtime. He describes the Spirit of Life, the soul that animates the world, fired with passion of Love, uniting with Nature and itself, itself a part of Nature, and filling
its own bosom with new productions. This union of the universe with itself, this mutual action of two

sexes, he terms "the great Secrets of Nature," "the Mysteries of the Union of Heaven with Earth, imaged in the Sacred Mysteries of Atys and Bacchus."
Varro tells us that the great Divinities adored at Samothrace were the Heavens and the Earth,
considered as First Causes or Primal Gods, and as male and female agents, one bearing to the other the relations that the Soul and Principle of Movement bear to the body or the matter that receives them.
These were the gods revered in the Mysteries of that Island, as they were in the orgies of Phoenicia.
Everywhere the sacred body of Nature was covered with the veil of allegory, which concealed it from the profane, and allowed it to be seen only by the sage who thought it worthy to be the object of his
study and investigation. She showed herself to those only who loved her in spirit and in truth, and she abandoned the indifferent and careless to error and to ignorance. "The Sages of Greece," says
Pausanias, "never wrote otherwise than in an enigmatical manner, never naturally and directly".
"Nature," says Sallust the Philosopher, "should be sung only in a language that imitates the secrecy of her processes and operations. She is herself an enigma. We see only bodies in movement; the forces and
springs that move them are hidden from us." The poets inspired by the Divinity, the wisest philosophers, all the theologians, the chiefs of the initiations and Mysteries, even the gods uttering their
oracles, have borrowed the figurative language of allegory. "The Egyptians," says Proclus, "preferred that mode of teaching, and spoke of the great secrets of Nature, only in mythological enigmas". The
Gymnosophists of India and the Druids of Gaul lent to science the same enigmatic language and in the same style wrote the Hierophants of Phoenicia.
The division of things into the active and the passive cause leads to that of the two Principles of Light
and Darkness, connected with and corresponding with it. For Light comes from the ethereal substance that composes the active cause, and darkness from earth or the gross matter which composes the
passive cause. In Hesiod, the Earth, by its union with Tartarus, engenders Typhon. Chief of the Powers or Genii of Darkness. Put it unites itself with the Ether or Ouranos, when it engenders the Gods of
Olympus, or the Stars, children of Starry Ouranos.
Light was the first Divinity worshipped by men. To it they owed the brilliant spectacle of Nature. It seems an emanation from the Creator of all things, making known to our senses the Universe which
darkness hides from our eyes, and, as it were giving it existence. Darkness, as it were, reduces all nature again to nothingness, and almost entirely annihilates man.
Naturally, therefore, two substances of opposite natures were imagined, to each of which the world was
in turn subjected, one contributing to its felicity and the other to its misfortune. Light multiplied its enjoyments; Darkness despoiled it of them; the former was its friend, the latter its enemy. To one all

good was attributed; to the other all evil and thus the words "Light" and "Good" became synonymous, and the words "Darkness" and "Evil." It seeming that Good and Evil could not flow from one and the
same source, any more than could Light and Darkness, men naturally imagined two Causes or Principles, of different natures and opposite in their effects, one of which shed Light and Good, and the
other Darkness and Evil, on the Universe.
This distinction of the two Principles was admitted in all the Theologies, and formed one of the principal bases of all religions. It entered as a primary element into the sacred fables, the cosmogonies
and the Mysteries of antiquity. "We are not to suppose," says Plutarch, "that the Principles of the Universe are inanimate bodies, as Democritus and Epicurus thought; nor that a matter devoid of
qualities is organized and arranged by a single Reason or Providence, Sovereign over all things, as the Stoics held; for it is not possible that a single Being, good or evil, is the cause of all inasmuch as God
can in nowise be the cause of any evil. The harmony of the Universe is a combination of contraries, like the strings of a lyre, or that of a bow, which alternately is stretched and relaxed." "The good," says
Euripides, "is never separated from the Evil.
The two must mingle, that all may go well." And this opinion as to the two principles, continues Plutarch, "is that of all antiquity. From the Theologians and Legislators it passed to the Poets and
Philosophers. Its author is unknown; but the opinion itself is established by the traditions of the whole human race, and consecrated in the mysteries and sacrifices both of the Greeks and Barbarians, wherein
was recognized the dogma of opposing principles in nature, which, by their contrariety, produce the mixture of good and evil. We must admit two contrary causes, two opposing powers, which lead, one to
the right and the other to the left and thus control our life, as they do the sublunary world, which is therefore subject to so many changes and irregularities of every kind. For if there can be no effect
without a cause, and if the Good cannot be the cause of the Evil, it is absolutely necessary that there should be a cause for the Evil, as there is one for the Good." This doctrine, he adds, has been generally
received among most nations, and especially by those who have had the greatest reputation for wisdom. All have admitted two gods, with different occupations, one making the good and the other the evil
found in nature. The former has been styled "God," the latter "Demon." The Persians, or Zoroaster, named the former Ormuzd and the latter Ahriman; of whom they said one was of the nature of Light,
the other of that of Darkness. The Egyptians called the former Osiris, and the latter Typhon, his eternal enemy.
The Hebrews, at least after their return from the Persian captivity, had their good Deity, and the Devil, a
bad and malicious Spirit, ever opposing God, and Chief of the Angels of Darkness, as God was of those of Light. The word "Satan" means, in Hebrew, simply, "The Adversary."
The Chaldeans, Plutarch says, had their good and evil stars. The Greeks had their Jupiter and Pluto, and
their Giants and Titans, to whom were assigned the attributes of the Serpent with which Pluto or

Serapis was encircled, and the shape whereof was assumed by Typhon, Ahriman, and the Satan of the Hebrews. Every people had something equivalent to this.
The People of Pegu believe in two Principles, one author of Good and the other of Evil, and strive to
propitiate the latter, while they think it needless to worship the former, as he is incapable of doing evil. The people of Java, of the Moluccas, of the Gold Coast, the Hottentots, the people of Teneriffe and
Madagascar, and the Savage Tribes of America, all worship and strive to avert the anger and propitiate the goodwill of the Evil Spirit.
But among the Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, and Assyrians, the doctrine of the two
Principles formed a complete and regularly arranged theological system. It was the basis of the religion of the Magi and of Egypt. The author of an ancient work, attributed to Origen, says that Pythagoras
learned from Zarastha, a Magus at Babylon (the same, perhaps, as Zerdusht or Zoroaster), that there are two principles of all things, whereof one is the father and the other the mother; the former, Light, and
the latter, Darkness. Pythagoras thought that the Dependencies on Light were warmth, dryness, lightness, swiftness and those on Darkness, cold, wet, weight, and slowness; and that the world derived
its existence from these two principles, as from the male and the female. According to Porphyry, he conceived two opposing powers, one good, which he termed Unity, the Light, Right, the Equal, the
Stable, the Straight; the other evil, which he termed Binary, Darkness, the Left, the Unequal, the Crooked.
These ideas he received from the Orientals, for he dwelt twelve years at Babylon, studying with the
Magi. Varro says he recognized two Principles of all things, the Finite and the Infinite, Good and Evil, Life and Death, Day a Night. White he thought was of the nature of the Good Principle, and Black of
that of the Evil; that Light and Darkness, Heat and Cold, the Dry and the Wet, mingled in equal proportions; that Summer was the triumph of heat, and Winter of cold; that their equal combination
produced Spring and Autumn, the former producing verdure and favorable to health, and the latter, deteriorating everything, giving birth to maladies. He applied the same idea to the rising and setting of
the sun and, like the Magi, held that God or Ormuzd in the body resembled light, and in the soul, truth.
Aristotle, like Plato, admitted a principle of Evil, resident in matter and in its eternal imperfection.
The Persians said that Ormuzd, born of the pure Light, and Ahriman, born of darkness, were ever at war. Ormuzd produced six Gods, Beneficence, Truth, Good Order, Wisdom, Riches, and Virtuous Joy.
These were so many emanations from the Good Principle, so many blessings bestowed by it on men. Ahriman, in his turn, produced six Devs, opponents of the six emanations from Ormuzd. Then Ormuzd
made himself three times as great as before, ascended as far above the sun as the sun is above the earth, and adorned the heavens with stars, of which he made Sirius the sentinel or advanceguard: that he then

created twentyfour other Deities, and placed them in an egg, where Ahriman also placed twentyfour others, created by him, who broke the egg, and so intermingled Good and Evil. Theopompus adds that,
according to the Magi, for two terms of three thousand years, each of the two Principles is to be by turns victor and the other vanquished; then for three thousand more for each they are to contend with
each other, each destroying reciprocally the works of the other; after which Ahriman is to perish, and men, wearing transparent bodies, to enjoy unutterable happiness.
The twelve great Deities of the Persians, the six Amshaspands and six Devs, marshalled, the former
under the banner of Light, and the latter under that of Darkness, are the twelve Zodiacal Signs or Months; the six supreme signs, or those of Light, or of Spring and Summer, commencing with Aries,
and the six inferior, of Darkness, or of Autumn and Winter, commencing with Libra. Limited Time, as contradistinguished from Time without limits, or Eternity, is Time created and measured by the
celestial revolutions. It is comprehended in a period divided into twelve parts, each subdivided into a thousand parts, which the Persians termed years.
Thus the circle annually traversed by the Sun was divided into 12,000 parts, or each sign into 3,000:
and thus, each year, the Principle of Light and Good triumphed for 3,000 years, that of Evil and Darkness for 3, 000, and they mutually destroyed each other's labors for 6,000, or 3,000 for each: so that
the Zodiac was equally divided between them. And accordingly Ocellus Lucanus, the Disciple of Pythagoras, held that the principal cause of all sublunary effects resided in the Zodiac, and that from it
flowed the good or bad influences of the planets that revolved therein.
The twentyfour good and twentyfour evil Deities, enclosed in the Egg, are the fortyeight constellations of the ancient sphere, equally divided between the realms of Light and Darkness, on the
concavity of the celestial sphere which was apportioned among them and which, enclosing the world and planets, was the mystic and sacred egg of the Magi, the Indians, and the Egyptians, the egg that
issued from the mouth of the God Kneph, that figured as the Orphic Egg in the Mysteries of Greece, that issued from the God Chumong of the Coresians, and from the Egyptian Osiris and the God Phanes
of the Modern Orphics, Principle of Light, the egg crushed by the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, and from which the world emerged; that placed by the Greeks at the feet of Bacchus the bullhorned God,
and from which Aristophanes makes Love emerge, who with Night organizes Chaos.
Thus the Balance, the Scorpion, the Serpent of Ophiucus, are the Dragon of the Hesperides became malevolent Signs and Evil Genii and entire nature was divided between the two principles, and between
the agents or partial causes subordinate to them. Hence Michael and his Archangels, and Satan and his fallen compeers. Hence the wars of Jupiter and the Giants, in which the Gods of Olympus fought on the
side of the Light God, agains the dark progeny of earth and Chaos; a war which Proclus regarded as symbolizing the resistance opposed by dark and chaotic matter to the active and beneficent force which
gives it organization; an idea which in part appears in the old theory of two Principles, one innate in the

active and luminous substance of Heaven, and the other in the inert and dark substance of matter that resists the order and the good that Heaven communicates to it.
Osiris conquers Typhon, and Ormuzd, Ahriman, when, at the Vernal Equinox, the creative action of
Heaven and its demiourgic energy is most strongly manifested. Then the principle of Light and Good overcomes that of Darkness and Evil, and the world rejoices, redeemed from cold and wintry darkness
by the beneficent Sign into which the Sun then enters triumphant and rejoicing, after his resurrection.
From the doctrine of the two Principles, Active and Passive grew that of the Universe, animated by a Principle of Eternal Life, and by a Universal Soul, from which every isolated and temporary being
received at its birth an emanation, which, at the death of such being, returned to its source.
The life of matter as much belonged to nature as did matter itself and as life is manifested by movement, the sources of life must needs seem to be placed in those luminous and eternal bodies, and above all in
the Heaven in which they revolve, and which whirls them along with itself in that rapid course that is swifter than all other movement. And fire and heat have so great an analogy with life, that cold like
absence of movement, seemed the distinctive characteristic of death. Accordingly, the vital fire that blazes in the Sun and produces the heat that vivifies everything, was regarded as the principle of
organization and life of all sublunary beings.
According to this doctrine, the Universe is not to be regarded in its creative and eternal action, merely as an immense machine moved by powerful springs and forced into a continual movement which,
emanating from the circumference, extends to the centre acts and reacts in every possible direction, and reproduces in succession all the varied forms which matter receives. So to regard it would be to
recognize a cold and purely mechanical action, the energy of which could never produce life.
On the contrary, it was thought, the Universe should be deemed an immense Being, always living, always moved and always moving in an eternal activity inherent in itself, and which, subordinate to no
foreign cause, is communicated to all its parts, connects them together, and makes of the world of things a complete and perfect whole. The order and harmony which reign therein seem to belong to and
be a part of it, and the design of the various plans of construction of organized beings would seem to be graven in its Supreme Intelligence, source of all the other Intelligences which it communicates together
with life to man. Nothing existing out of it, it must be regarded as the principle and term of all things.
Chaeremon had no reason for saying that the Ancient Egyptians, inventors of the sacred fables, and adorers of the Sun and the other luminaries, saw in the Universe only a machine, without life and
without intelligence, either in its whole or in its parts and that their cosmogony was a pure Epicureanism, which required only matter and movement to organize its world and govern it. Such an

opinion would necessarily exclude all religious worship. Wherever we suppose a worship, there we must suppose intelligent Deities who receive it, and are sensible to the homage of their adorers and no
other people were so religious as the Egyptians.
On the contrary, with them the immense, immutable and Eternal Being, termed "God" or "the Universe," had eminently and in all their plenitude, that life and intelligence which sublunary beings,
each an infinitely small and temporary portion of itself, possess in a far inferior degree and infinitely less quantity. It was to them, in some sort, like the Ocean, whence the springs, brooks and rivers have
risen by evaporation and to the bosom whereof they return by a longer or shorter course and after a longer or shorter separation from the immense mass of its waters.
The machine of the Universe was, in their view, like that of man, moved by a Principle of Life which
kept it in eternal activity, and circulated in all its parts. The Universe was a living and animated being, like man and the other animals; or rather they were so only because the Universe was essentially so, and
for a few moments communicated to each an infinitely minute portion of its eternal life, breathed by it into the inert and gross matter of sublunary bodies. That withdrawn, man or the animal died; and the
Universe alone, living and circulating around the wrecks of their bodies, by its eternal movement, organized and animated new bodies, returning to them the eternal fire and subtle substance which
vivifies itself, and which, incorporated in its immense mass, was its universal soul.
These were the ancient ideas as to this Great GOD, Father of all the gods, or of the World; of this BEING, Principle of all things, and of which nothing other than itself is Principle, the Universal cause
that was termed God. Soul of the Universe, eternal like it, immense like it, supremely active and potent in its varied operations, penetrating all parts of this vast body, impressing a regular and symmetrical
movement on the spheres, making the elements instinct with activity and order, mingling with everything, organizing everything, vivifying and preserving everything, this was the UNIVERSE GOD
which the ancients adored as Supreme Cause and God of Gods.
Anchises, in the AEneid, taught AEneas this doctrine of Pythagoras, learned by him from his Masters, the Egyptians, in regard to the Soul and Intelligence of the Universe, from which our souls and
intelligences, as well as our life and that of the animals, emanate, Heaven, Earth, the Sea, the Moon and the Stars, he said, are moved by a principle of internal life which perpetuates their existence; a great
intelligent soul, that penetrates every part of the vast body of the Universe, and, mingling with everything, agitates it by an eternal movement. It is the source of life in all living things. The force
which animates all, emanates from the eternal fire that burns in Heaven. In the Georgics, Virgil repeats the same doctrine; and that, at the death of every animal, the life that animated it, part of the universal
life, returns to its Principle and to the source of life that circulates in the sphere of the Stars.

Servius makes God the active Cause that organizes the elements into bodies, the vivifying breath or spirit, that, spreading through matter or the elements, produces and engenders all things. The elements
compose the substance of our bodies. God composes the souls that vivify these bodies. From it come the instincts of animals, from it their life, he says and when they die, that life returns to and reenters
into the Universal Soul, and their bodies into Universal Matter.
Timceus of Locria and Plato his Commentator wrote of the Soul of the World, devoloping the doctrine of Pythagoras, who thought, says Cicero, that God is the Universal Soul, resident everywhere in nature
and of which our Souls are but emanations. '"God is one," says Pythagoras, as cited by Justin Martyr: "He is not, as some think, without the world, but within it, and entire in its entirety. He sees all that
becomes, forms all immortal beings, is the author of their powers and performances, the origin of all things, the Light of Heaven, the Father, the Intelligence, the Soul of all beings, the Mover of all
spheres".
God, in the view of Pythagoras, was ONE, a single substance, whose continuous parts extended through all the Universe, without separation, difference, or inequality, like the soul in the human body.
He denied the doctrine of the spiritualists, who had severed the Divinity from the Universe, making Him exist apart from the Universe, which thus became no more than a material work, on which acted
the Abstract Cause, a God, isolated from it. The Ancient Theology did not so separate God from the Universe. This Eusebius attests, in saying that but a small number of wise men, like Moses, had sought
for God or the Cause of all. Outside of that, aIl the while Philosophers of Egypt and Phoenicia, real authors of all the old Cosmogonies, had placed the Supreme Cause in the Universe itself and in its
parts, so that, in their view, the world and all its parts are in God.
The World or Universe was thus compared to man; the Principle of Life that moves it, to that which moves man; the Soul of the World to that of man. Therefore Pythagoras called man a microcosm, or
little world, as possessing in miniature all the qualities found on a great scale in the Universe; by his reason and intelligence partaking of the Divine Nature and by his faculty of changing aliments into
other substances, of growing, and reproducing himself, partaking of elementary Nature. Thus he made the Universe a great intelligent Being, like man an immense Deity, having in itself, what man has in
himself, movement, life, and intelligence, and besides, a perpetuity of existence, which man has not; and, as having in itself perpetuity of movement and life, therefore the Supreme Cause of all.
Everywhere extended, this Universal Soul does not, in the view of Pythagoras, act everywhere equally
nor in the same manner. The highest portion of the Universe, being as it were its head, seemed to him its principal seat, and there was the guiding power of the rest of the world.

that moves, by a constant and regular progression, the immortal bodies that form the harmonious system of the heavens.
Manilius says: "I sing the invisible and potent Soul of Nature; that Divine Substance which, everywhere
inherent in Heaven Earth, and the Waters of the Ocean, forms the bond that holds together and makes one all the parts of the vast body of the Universe. It, balancing all Forces, and harmoniously arranging
varied relations of the many members of the world, maintains it the life and regular movement that agitate it, as a result of action of the living breath or single spirit that dwells in all parts, circulates in all
the channels of universal nature, flashes with rapidity to all its points, and gives to animated bodies configurations appropriate to the organization of each. This eternal Law, this Divine Force, that
maintains the harmony the world, makes use of the Celestial Signs to organize and guide the animated creatures that breathe upon the earth and gives each of them the character and habits most appropriate.
By action of this Force, Heaven rules the condition of the Earth and of its fields cultivated by the husbandman; it gives us or takes from us vegetation and harvests; it makes the great ocean overpass its
limits at the flow, and retire within them again at ebbing, of the tide."
Thus it is no longer by means of a poetic fiction only that heavens and the earth become animated and personified, and a deemed living existences, from which other existences proceed. For now they live,
with their own life, a life eternal like th bodies, each gifted with a life and perhaps a soul, like those man, a portion of the universal life and universal soul; and the other bodies that they form, and which
they contain in the bosoms, live only through them and with their life, as the embry lives in the bosom of its mother, in consequence and by means a the life communicated to it, and which the mother ever
maintains by the active power of her own life. Such is the universal life the world, reproduced in all the beings which its superior portion creates in its inferior portion, that is as it were the mnatrix of the
world, or of the beings that the heavens engender in its bosom.
"The soul of the world," says Macrobius, "is nature itself" [as the soul of man is man himself], "always acting through the celestial spheres which it moves, and which but follow the irresistible impulse it
impresses on them.
The heavens, the sun, great seat of generative power, the signs, the stars and the planets act only with the activity of the soul of the Universe. From that soul, through them, come all the variations and
challges of sublunary nature, of which the heavens and celestial bodies are but the secondary causes. The zodiac, with its signs, is an existence, immortal and divine, organized by the universal soul, and
producing, or gathering in itself, all the varied emanations of the different powers that make up the nature of the Divinity".
This doctrine, that gave to the heavens and the spheres living souls, each a portion of the universal soul,

was of extreme antiquity. It was held by the old Sabaeans. It was taught by Timaeus, P]ato, Speusippus, Iamblichus, Macrobius, Marcus Aurelius, and Pythagoras. When once men had assigned a soul to the
Universe, containing in itself the plenitude of the animal life of particular beings and even of the stars, they soon supposed that soul to be essentially intelligent and the source of intelligence of all intelligent
beings. Then the Universe became to them not only animated but intelligent, and of that intelligence the different parts of nature partook. Each soul was the vehicle and as it were the envelope of the
intelligence that attached itself to it and could repose nowhere else. Without a soul there could be no intelligence and as there was a universal soul, source of all souls, the universal soul was gifted with a
universal intelligence, source of all particular intelligences. So the soul of the world contained in itself the intelligence of the world.
All the agents of nature into which the universal soul entered, received also a portion of its intelligence,
and the Universe, in its totality and in its parts, was filled with intelligences, that might be regarded as so many emanations from the sovereign and universal intelligence. Wherever the divine soul acted as a
cause, there also was intelligence and thus Heaven, the stars, the elements and all parts of the Universe, became the seats of so many divine intelligences. Every minutest portion of the great soul became a
partial intelligence, and the more it was disengaged from gross matter, the more active and intelligent it was. And all the old adorers of nature, the theologians, astrologers, poets and the most distinguished
philosophers, supposed that the stars were so many animated and intelligent beings, or eternal bodies, active causes of effects here below, whom a principle of life animated, and whom an intelligence
directed, which was but an emanation from, and a portion of, the universal life and intelligence of the world.
The Universe itself was regarded as a supremely intelligent being. Such was the doctrine of Timaeus of
Locria. The soul of man was part of the intelligent soul of the Universe, and therefore itself intelligent. His opinion was that of many other philosophers Cleanthes, a disciple of ZENO, regarded the Universe
as God, or a the unproduced and universal cause of all effects produced. He ascribed a soul and intelligence to universal nature, and to this intelligent soul, in his view, divinity belonged. From it the
intelligence of man was an emanation, and shared its divinity.
Chrysippus, the most subtle of the Stoics, placed in the universal reason that forms the soul and intelligence of nature, that divine force or essence of the Divinity which he assigned to the world moved
by the universal soul that pervades its every part.
An interlocutor in Cicero's work, De Natura Deorum, formally argues that the Universe is necessarily intelligent and wise, because man, an infinitely small portion of it, is so. Cicero makes the same
argument in his oration for Milo. The physicists came to the same conclusion as the pllilosophers. They supposed that movement essentially belonged to the soul, and the direction of regular and ordered
movements to the intelligence. And, as both movement and order exist in the Universe, therefore, they

489/641
held, there must be in it a soul and an intelligence that rule it and are not to be distinguished from itself; because the idea of the Universe is but the aggregate of all the particular ideas of all things that exist.
The argument was, that the Heavens and the Stars which make part of them, are animated, because they
possess a portion of the Universal Soul; they are intelligent beings, because that Universal Soul, part whereof they possess, is supremely intelligent and they share Divinity with Universal Nature, because
Divinity resides in the Universal Soul and Intelligence which move an rule the world, and of each of which they hold a share. By this process of logic, the interlocutor in Cicero assigned Divinity to the
Stars, as animated beings gifted with sensibility and intelligence, and composed of the noblest and purest portions of the ethereal substance, unmixed with matter of an alien nature, an essentially
containing light and heat. Hence he concluded them to be so many gods, of an intelligence superior to that of other existences, corresponding to the lofty height in which they moved with such perfect
regularity and admirable harmony, with a movement spontaneous and free. Hence he made them "Gods," active, eternal, and intelligent "Causes"; and peopled the realm of Heaven with a host of
Eternal Intelligences, celestial Genii or Angels, sharing the universal Divinity, and associated with it in the administration of the Universe, and the dominion exercised over sublunary nature and man.
We make the motive force of the planets to be a mechanical law, which we explain by the combination
of two forces, the centripetal and centrifugal, whose origin we cannot demonstrate, but whose force we can calculate. The ancients regarded them as moved by an intelligent force that had its origin in the first
and universal Intelligence. Is it so certain, after
all, that we are any nearer the truth than they were; or that we know what our "centripetal and
centrifugal forces" mean; for what is a force? With us, the entire Deity acts upon and moves each planet, as He does the sap that circulates in the little blade of grass and in the particles of blood in the
tiny veins of the invisible rotifer. With the Ancients, the Deity of each Star was but a portion of the Universal God, the Soul of Nature. Each Star and Planet with them was moved of itself, and directed by
its own special intelligence. And this opinion of Achilles Tatius, Diodorus, Chrysippus, Aristotlc, Plato, Heraclides of Pontus, Theophrastus, Simplicius, Macrobius, and Proclus, that in each Star there is an
immortal Soul and Intelligence, part of the Universal Soul and Intelligence of the Whole, this opinion of Orpheus, Plotinus, and the Stoics, was in reality, that of many Christian philosophers. For Origen
held the same opinion; and Augustin held that every visible thing in the world was superintended by an Aneglic Power and Cosma, the Monk, believed that every Star was under the guidance of an Angel; and
the author of the Octateuch, written in the time of the Emperor Justin, says that they are moved by the impulse communicated to them by Angels stationed above the firmament. Whether the stars were
animated beings, was a question that Christian antiquity did not decide. Many of the Christian doctors believed they were. Saint Augustin hesitates, Saint Jerome doubts, if Solomon did not assign souls to
the Stars. Saint Ambrose does not doubt they have souls; and Pamphilus says that many of the Church believe they are reasonable beings, while many think otherwise, but that neither one nor the other
opinion is heretical.

Thus the Ancient Thought, earnest and sincere, wrought out the idea of a Soul inherent in the Universe and in its several parts. The next step was to separate that Soul from the Universe, and give to it an
external and independent existence an personality; still omnipresent, in every inch of space and in every particle of matter, and yet not a part of Nature, but its Cause and its Creator. This is the middle ground
between the two doctrine of Pantheism (or that all is God, and God is in all and is all), on the one side, and Atheism (or that all is nature, and there is no other God), on the other; which doctrines, after all,
when reduced to their simplest terms, seem to be the same.
We complacently congratulate ourselves on our recognition of personal God, as being the conception most suited to human sympathies, and exempt from the mystifications of Pantheism. But the Divinity
remains still a mystery, notwithstanding all the devices which symbolism, either from the organic or inorganic creation, can supply; and personification is itself a symbol, liable misapprehension as much
as, if not more so than, any other, since it is apt to degenerate into a mere reflection of our own infirmities and hence any affirmative idea or conception that we can, our own minds, picture of the
Deity, must needs be infinitely inadequate.
The spirit of the Vedas (or sacred Indian Books, of great antiquity), as understood by their earliest as well as most recent expositors, is decidedly a pantheistic monotheism one God, a He all in all; the many
divinities, numerous as the prayers a dressed to them, being resolvable into the titles and attributes of a few, and ultimately into THE ONE. The machinery of personification was understood to have been
unconsciously assumed as mere expedient to supply the deficiencies of language and the Mimansa justly considered itself as only interpreting the true meaning of the Mantras, when it proclaimed that, in
the beginning, "Nothing was but Mind, the Creative Thought of Him which existed alone from the beginning, and breathed without afflation." The idea suggested in the Mantras is dogmatically asserted
and developed in the Upanischadas. The Vedanta philosophy, assuming the mystery of the "ONE IN MANY" as the fundamental article of faith, maintained not only the Divine Unity, but the identity of
matter and spirit. The unity which it advocates is that of mind. Mind is the Universal Element, the One God, the Great Soul, Mahaatma. He is the material as well as efficient cause, and the world is a texture
of which he is both the web and the weaver. He is the Macrocosmos, the universal organism called Pooroosha, of which Fire, Air, and Sun are only the chief members. His head is light, his eyes the sun
and moon, his breath the wind, his voice the opened Vedas. All proceeds from Brahm, like the web from the spider and the grass from the earth.
Yet it is only the impossibility of expressing in language the origination of matter from spirit, which
gives to Hindu philosophy the appearance of materialisrm. Formless Himself, the Deity is present in all forms. His glory is displayed in the Universe as the image of the sun in water, which is, yet is not, the
luminary itself. All maternal agency and appearance, the subjective world, are to a great extent phantasms, the notional representations of ignorance. They occupy, however, a middle ground between
reality and nonreality; they are unreal, because nothing exists but Brahm; yet in some degree real, inasmuch as they constitute an outward manifestation of him. They are a selfinduced hypostasis of the

Deity, under which He presents to Himself the whole of animate and inanimate Nature, the actuality of the moment, the diversified appearances which successively invest the one Pantheistic Spirit.
The great aim of reason is to generalize; to discover unity in multiplicity, order in apparent confusion;
to separate from the accidental and the transitory, the stable and universal. In the contemplation of Nature, and the vague, but almost intuitive perception of a general uniformity of plan among endless
varieties of operation and form, arise those solemn and reverential feelings, which, if accompanied by intellectual activity, may eventually ripen into philosophy.
Consciousness of self and of personal identity is coexistent with our existence. We cannot conceive of
mental existence without it. It is not the work of reflection nor of logic, nor the result of observation, experiment, and experience. It is a gift from God, like instinct and that consciousness of a thinking soul
which is really the person that we are, and other than our body, is the best and most solid proof of the soul's existence. We have the same consciousness of a Power on which we are dependent; which we can
define and form an idea or picture of, as little as we can of the soul, and yet which we feel, and therefore know, exists.
True at correct ideas of that Power, of the Absolute Existence from which all procceds, we cannot trace;
if by true and correct we mean equate ideas; for of such we are not, with our limited faculties, capable. And ideas of His nature, so far correct as we are capable of entertaining, can only be attained either by
direct inspiration or by the investigations of philosophy.
The idea of the universal preceded the recognition of any system for its explanation. It was felt rather than understood; and it was long before the grand conception on which all philosophy rests received
through deliberate investigation that analytical development which might properly entitle it to the name. The sentiment, when first observed by the selfconscious mind, was, says Plato, "a Divine gift,
communicated to mankind by some Prometheus, or by those ancients who lived nearer to the gods than our degenerate selves". The mind deduced from its first experiences the notion of a general Cause or
Antecedent, to which it shortly gave a name and personified it. This was the statement of a theorem, obscure in proportion to its generality. It explained all things but itself. It was a true cause, but an
incomprehensible one. Ages had to pass before the nature of the theorem could rightly appreciated, and before men, acknowledging the First Cause to be an object of faith rather than science, were contented
to confine their researches to those nearer relations of existence and succession, which are really within the reach of their faculties. At first, and for a long time, the intellect deserted the real for a hastily
formed ideal world, and the imagination usurped the place of reason, in attempting to put a construction on the most general and inadequate of conceptions, by transmuting its symbols into realities, and by
substantializing it under a thousand arbitrary forms.

In poetry, the idea of Divine unity became, as in Nature, obscured by a multifarious symbolism; and the notionalities of transcendental philosophy reposed on views of nature scarcely more profound than
those of the earliest symbolists. Yet the idea of unity was rather obscured than extinguished and Xenophanes appeared as an enemy of Homer, only because he more emphatically insisted on the
monotheistic element, which in poetry, has been comparatively overlooked. The first philosophy reasserted the unity which poetry had lost; but being unequal to investigate its nature, it again resigned
it to the world of approximate sensations, and became bewildered in materialism, considering the conceptional whole or First Element as some refinement of matter, unchangeable in its essence, though
subject to mutations of quality form in an eternal succession of seeming decay and regeneration; comparing it to water, air, or fire, as each endeavored to refine on the doctrine of his predecessor, or
was influenced by a different class of theological traditions.
In the philosophical systems, the Divine Activity, divided by the poets and by popular belief among a race of personifications, in whom the idea of descent replaced that of cause, or of pantheistic evolution,
was restored, without subdivision or reservation, to nature as a whole; at first as a mechanical force or life; afterward as an allpervading soul or inherent thought and lastly as an external directing
Intelligence.
The Ionian revival of pantheism was materialistic. The Moving Force was inseparable from a material element, a subtle yet visible ingredient. Under the form of air or fire, the principle of life was associated
with the most obvious material machinery of nature. Everything, it was said, is alive and full of gods. The wonders of the volcano, the magnet, the ebb and flow of the tide, were vital indications, the
breathing or moving of the Great WorldAnimal. The imperceptible ether of Anaximenes had no positive quality beyond the atmospheric air with which it was easily confused: and even the "Infinite"
of Anaximander, though free of the conditions of quality or quantity, was only an ideal chaos, relieved of its coarseness by negations. It was the illimitable storehouse or Pleroma, out of which is evolved the
endless circle of phenomenal change. A moving Force was recognized in, but not clearly distinguished from, the material.
Space, Time, Figure, and Number, and other common forms or properties, which exist only as
attributes, were treated as substances, or at least as making a substantial connection between the objects to which they belong and all the conditions of material existence were supposed to have been evolved
out of the Pythagorean Monad.
The Eleatic philosophers treated conceptions not only as entities, but as the only entities, alone possessing the stability an certainty and reality vainly sought among phenomena. The only reality was
Thought. "All real existence," they said, "is mental existence; nonexistence, being inconceivable, is therefore impossble; existence fills up the whole range of thought, and is inseparable from its exercise;
thought and its object are one."

Xenophanes used ambiguous language, applicable to the material as well as to the mental, and
exclusively appropriate neither. In other words, he availed himself of material imagery to illustrate an indefinite meaning.
In announcing the universal being, he appealed to the heavens as the visible manifestation, calling it
spherical, a term borrowed from the material world. He said that God was neither moved nor unmoved, limited nor unlimited. He did not even attempt to express clearly what cannot be conceived clearly;
admitting, says Simplicius, that such speculations were above physics. Parmenides employed similar expedients, comparing his metaphysical Deity to a sphere, or to heat an aggregate or a continuity, and
so involuntarily withdrawing its nominal attributes.
The Atomic school, dividing the All into Matter and Force deemed matter unchangeable in its ultimate constitution, though infinitely variable in its resultant forms. They made all variety proceed from the
varied combinations of atoms; but they required no mover nor director of the atoms external to themselves; universal Reason; but a Mechanical Eternal Necessity, like that of the Poets. Still it is
doubtful whether there ever was a time when reason could be said to be entirely asleep, a stranger to its own existence, notwithstanding this apparent materialism. The earliest contemplation of the external
world, which brings it into an imagined association with ourselves, assigns, either to its whole or its parts, the sensation and volition which belong to our own souls.
Anaxagoras admitted the existence of ultimate elementary particles, as Empedocles did, from the
combinations whereof material phenomena resulted. But he asserted the Moving Force to be Mind; and yet, though he clearly saw the impossibility of advancing by illustration or definition beyond a
reasonable faith, or a simple negation of materiality, yet he could not wholly desist from the endeavor to illustrate the nature of this nonmatter or mind, by symbols drawn from those physical considerations
which decided him in placing it in a separate category. Whether as human reason, or as the regulating Principle in nature, he held it different from all other things in character and effect, and that therefore it
must necessarily differ in its essential constitution. It was neither Matter, nor a Force conjoined with matter, or homogeneous with it, but independent and generically distinct, especially in that, being the
source of all motion, separation, and cognintion it is something entirely unique, pure, and unmixed and so, being unhindered by any interfering influence limiting its independence of individual action, it has
Supreme Empire over all things, over the vortex of worlds as well as over all that live in them. It is most penetrating and powerful, mixing with other things, though no other thing mixes with it; exercises
universal control and cognition, and includes the Necessity of the Poets, as well as the independent power of thought which we exercise within ourselves. In short, it is the selfconscious power of thought
extended to the Universe, and exalted into the Supreme External Mind which sees, knows, and directs all things.

Thus Pantheism and Materialism were both avoided and matter, though as infinitely varied as the senses represent it, was held in a bond of unity transferred to a ruling power apart from it. That Power
could not be Prime Mover, if it were itself moved; nor AllGoverning, if not apart from the things it governs. If the arranging Principle were inherent in matter, it would have been impossible to account for
the existence of a chaos. If something external, then the old Ionian doctrine of a "beginning" became more easily conceivable, as being the epoch at which the Arranging Intelligence commenced its
operations.
But this grand idea of an allgoverning independent mind involved difficulties which proved insuperable; because it gave to matter, in the form of chaos, an independent and eternal selfexistence,
and so introduced a dualism of mind and matter. In the Mind or Intelligence, Anaxagoras included not only life and motion, but the moral principles of the noble and good; and probably used the term on
account of the popular misapplication of the word "God," and as being less liable to misconstruction, and more specifically marking his idea. His "Intelligence" principle remained practically liable to many
of the same defects as the "Necessity" of the poets. It was the presentiment of a great idea, which it was for the time impossible to explain or follow out. It was not yet intelligible, nor was even the road
operled throu which it might be approached.
Mind cannot advance in metaphysics beyond selfdeification. In attempting to go further, it only enacts the apotheosis of own subtle conceptions, and so sinks below the simpler ground already taken. The
realities which Plato could not recognize in phenomena, he discovered within his own mind, and as unhesitatingly as the old Theosophists installed its creations among the gods. He, like most
philosophers after Anaxagoras, made the Supreme Being to be Intelligence; but in other respects left His nature undefined, or rather indefinite through the variety of definitions, a conception vaguely
floating between Theism and Pantheism. Though deprecating the demoralizing tendencies of poetry, he was too wise to attempt to replace them by other representations of a positive kind. He justly says, that
spirit things can be made intelligible only through figures; and the forms of allegorical expression which, in a rude age, had been adopted unconsciously, were designedly chosen by the philosopher as
the most appropriate vehicles for theological ideas.
As the devices of symbolism were gradually stripped away, in order, if possible, to reach the fundamental conception, the religious feeling habitually connected with it seemed to evaporate under
the process. And yet the advocates of Monotheism, Xenophanes and Heraclitus, declaimed only against the making of gods in human form. They did not attempt to strip nature of its divinity, but rather to
recall religious contemplation from an exploded symbolism to a purer one. They continued the veneration which, in the background of poetry, has been maintained for Sun and Stars, the Fire or Ether.
Socrates prostrated himself before the rising luminary; and the eternal spheres, which seem to have shared the religious homage of Xenophanes, retained a secondary and qualified Divinity in the Schools
of the Peripatetics and Stoics.

The unseen being or beings revealed only to the Intellect became the theme of philosophy; and their more ancient symbols, if not openly discredited, were passed over with evasive generality, as beings
respecting whose problematical existence we must be "content with what has been reported by those ancients, who, assuming to be their descendants, must therefore be supposed to have been well
acquainted with their own ancestors and family connections." And the Theism of Anaxagoras was still more decidedly subversive, not only of Mythology, but of the whole religion of outward nature; it being
an appeal from the world without, to the consciousness of spiritual dignity within man.
In the doctrines of Aristotle, the world moves on uninterruptedly, always changing, yet ever the same, like Time, the Eternal Now, knowing neither repose nor death. There is a principle which makes good
the failure of identity, by multiplying resemblances; the destruction of the individual by an eternal renewal of the form in which matter is manifested. This regular eternal movement implies an Eternal
Mover; not an inert Eternity, such as the Platonic Eidos, but one always acting, His essence being to act, for otherwise he might never have acted, and the existence of the world would be an accident; for what
should have, in that case, decided Him to act, after long inactivity? Nor can He be partly in act and partly potential, that is, quiescent and undetermined to act or not to act, for even in that case motion
would not be eternal, but contingent and precarious. He is therefore wholly in act, a pure, untiring activity, and for the same reasons wholly immaterial. Thus Aristotle avoided the idea that God was
inactive and selfcontemplative for an eternity, and then for some unknown reason, or by some unknown motive, commenced to act outwardly and produce; but he incurred the opposite hazard, of
making the result of His action, matter and the Universe, be coexistent with Himself; or in
other words, of denying that there was any time when His outward action commenced.
The First Cause, he said, unmoved, moves all. Act was first, and the Universe has existed forever; one
persistent cause directing its continuity. The unity of the First Mover follows from His immateriality. If He were not Himself unmoved, the series of motions and causes of motion would be infinite. Unmoved,
therefore, and unchangeable Himself, all movement, even that in space is caused by Him. He is necessary; He cannot be otherwise than as He is and it is only through the necessity of His being that
we can account for those necessary eternal relations which make a science of Being possible. Thus Aristotle leaned to a seemingly personal God; not a Being of parts and passions, like the God of the
Hebrews, or that of the mass even of educated men in our own day, but a Substantial Head of all the categories of being, an Individuality of Intelligence, the dogma of Anaxagoras revived out of a more
elaborate and profound analysis of Nature; something like that living unambiguous Principle which the old poets in advance of the materialistic cosmogonists from Night a Chaos, had discovered in Ouranos
or Zeus. Soon, however, the vision of personality is withdrawn, and we reach that culminating point of thought where the real blends with the ideal; where moral action and objective thought (that is, thought
exercised to anything outside of itself), as well as the material body, a excluded; and where the divine action in the world retains veil of impenetrable mystery, and to the utmost ingenuity research presents
but a contradiction. At this extreme, the series of efficient causes resolves itself into the Final Cause. That which moves, itself unmoved, can only be the immobility Thought or Form. God is both formal,

496/641
efficient, and final cause; the One Form comprising all forms, the one good including good, the goal of the longing of the University, moving the world as the object of love or rational desire moves the
individual. He is the internal or selfrealized Final Cause, having no end beyond Himself. He is no moral agent; for if He were, He would be but an instrument for producing something still higher and
greater. One sort of act only, activity of mind or thought, can be assigned to Him who is at once all act yet all repose.
What we call our highest pleasure, which distinguishes wakefulness and sensation and which gives a
reflected charm to hope and memory, is with Him perpetual. His existence is unbroken enjoyment of that which is most excellent but only temporary with us. The divine quality of active and yet tranquil
selfcontemplation characterizing intelligence, is preeminently possessed by the divine mind; His thought, which is His existence, being unlike ours, unconditional and wholly act. If He can receive any
gratification or enjoyment from that which exists beyond Himself, He can also be displeased and pained with it, and then He would be an imperfect being. To suppose pleasure experienced by Him from
anything outward, supposes insufficient prior enjoyment and happiness, and a sort of dependency. Man's Good is beyond himself; not so God's. The eternal act which produces the world's life is the
eternal desire of good. The object of the Absolute Thought is the Absolute Good. Nature is all movement, and Thought all repose. In contemplating that absolute good, the Finality can contemplate
only itself; and thus, all material interference being excluded, the distinction of subject and object vanishes in complete identification, and the Divine Thought is "the thinking of thought." The energy of
mind is life, and God is that energy in its purity and perfection. He is therefore life itself, eternal and perfect and this sums up all that is meant by the term "God". And yet, after all this transcendentalism,
the very essence of thought consists in its mobility and power of transference from object to object; and we can conceive of no thought, without an object beyond itself, about which to think, or of any activity
in mere selfcontemplation, without outward act, movement, or manifestation.
Plato endeavors to show how the Divine Principle of Good becomes realized in Nature. Aristotle's system is a vast analogical induction to prove how all Nature tends toward a final good. Plato
considered Soul as a principle of movement, and made his Deity realize, that is, turn into realities, his ideas as a free, intelligent Force. Aristotle, for whom Soul is the motionless centre from which motion
radiates, and to which it converges, conceives a correspondingly unmoved God. The Deity of Plato creates, superintends, and rejoices in the universal joy of, His creatures. That of Aristotle is the
perfection of man's intellectual activity extended to the Universe. When he makes the Deity to be an eternal act of selfcontemplation, the world is not excluded from His cognizance, for He contemplates it
within Himself. Apart from and beyond the world, He yet mysteriously intermingles with it. He is universal as well as individual; His agency is necessary and general, yet also makes the real and the
good of the particular.
When Plato had given to the unformed world the animal life of the Ionians, and added to that the Anaxagorean Intelligence, overruling the wild principle of Necessity and when to Intelligence was

added Beneficence and the dread Wardours, Force and Strength, were made subordinate to Mildness and Goodness, it seemed as if a further advance were impossible, and that the Deity could not be more
than The Wise and The Good.
But the contemplation of the Good implies that of its opposite, Evil. When God is held to be "The Good," it is not because Evil is unknown, but because it is designedly excluded from His attributes. But
if Evil be a separate and independent existence, how would it fare with His prerogative of Unity and Supremacy? To meet this dilemma, it remained only to fall back on something more or less akin to the
vagueness of antiquity; to make a virtual confession of ignorance, to deny the ultimate reality of evil, like Plato and Aristotle, or with Speusippus, the eternity of its antithetical existence, to surmise that it is
only one of those notions which are indeed provisionally indispensable in a condition of finite knowledge, but of which so many have been already discredited by the advance of philosophy; to revert
in short, to the original conception of "The Absolute," or of a single Being, in whom all mysteries are explained, and before whom the disturbing principle is reduced to a mere turbid spot on the ocean of
Eternity, which to the eye of faith may be said no longer to exist.
But the absolute is nearly allied to the nonexistent. Matter and evil obtruded themselves too constantly and convincingly to be confuted or cancelled by subtleties of Logic. It is in vain to attempt to merge the
world in God, while the world of experience exhibits contrariety, imperfection, and mutability, instead of the immutability of its source.
Philosophy was but another name for uncertainty and after the mind had successively deified Nature
and its own conceptions, without any practical result but toilsome occupation; when the reality it sought, without or within, seemed ever to elude its grasp, the intellect, baffled in its higher flights,
sought advantage and repose in aiming at truth of a lower but more applicable kind.
The Deity of Plato is a Being proportioned to human sympathies; the Father of the World, as well as its Creator; the author of good only, not of evil. "Envy" he says, "is far removed from celestial beings, and
man, if willing, and braced for the effort, is permitted to aspire to a communion with the solemn troops and sweet societies of Heaven. God is the Idea or Essence of Goodness, the Good itself: in goodness,
He created the World, and gave to it the greatest perfection of which it was susceptible; making it, as far as possible, an image of Himself. The sublime type of all excellence is an object not only of veneration
but love". The Sages of old had already intimated in enigmas that God is the Author of Good; that like the Sun in Heaven, or AEsculapius on earth, He is "Healer," "Saviour" and "Redeemer," the destroyer
and averter of Evil, ever healing the mischiefs inflicted by Here, the wanton or irrational power of nature.
Plato only asserts with more distinctness the dogma of antiquity when he recognizes Love as the

498/641
highest and most beneficent of gods, who gives to nature the invigorating energy restored by the art of medicine to the body; since Love is emphatically the physician of the Universe, the AEsculapius to
whom Socrates wished to sacrifice in the hour of his death.
A figurative idea, adopted from familiar imagery, gave that endearing aspect to the divine connection with the Universe which had commanded the earliest assent of the sentiments, until, rising in
refinement with the progress of mental cultivation, it ultimately established itself as firmly in the deliberate approbation of the understanding, as it had ever responded to the sympathies. Even the rude
Scythians, Bithynians and Scandinavians, called God their "Father"; all nations traced their ancestry more or less directly to Heaven. The Hyperborean Olen, one of the oldest symbols of the religious
antiquity of Greece, made Love the First born of Nature. Who will venture to pronounce at what time God was first worthily and truly honored, or when man first began to feel aright the mute eloquence of
nature? In the obscure physics of the mystical Theologers who preceded Greek philosophy, Love was the Great First Cause and Parent of the Universe. "Zeus," says Proclus, "when entering upon the work
of creation, changed Himself into the form of Love and He brought forward Aphrodite, the principle of Unity and Universal Harmony, to display her light to all. In the depths of His mysterious being, He
contains the principle of love within Himself; in Him creative wisdom and blessed love are united".
"From the first of Days on these his love divine be fixed, His admiration; till in time complete What he admired and loved, his vital smile Unfolded into being".
The speculators of the venerable East, who had conceived the idea of an Eternal Being superior to all
affection and change, in his own sufficiency enjoying a plenitude of serene and independent bliss, were led to inquire into the apparently inconsistent fact of the creation of the world. Why, they asked, did He,
who required nothing external to Himself to complete His already existing Perfection, come forth out of His unrevealed and perfect existence, and become incorporated in the vicissitudes of nature? The
solution of the difficulty was Love. The Great Being beheld the beauty of His own conception, which dwelt with Him alone from the beginning, Maia, or Nature's loveliness, at once the germ of passion and
the source of worlds. Love became the universal parent, when the Deity, before remote and inscrutable, became ideally separated into the loving and the beloved.
And here again recurs the ancient difficulty; that, at whatever early period this creation occurred, an
eternity had previously elapsed, during which God, dwelling alone in His unimpeached unity, had no object for His love; and that the very word implies to us an existing object toward which the love is
directed; so that we cannot conceive of love in the absence of any object to be loved; and therefore we again return to this point, that if love is of God's essence, and He is unchangeable, the same necessity of
His nature, supposed to have caused creation, must ever have made His existence without an object to love impossible: and so that the Universe must have been coexistent with Himself.

The questions how and why evil exists in the Universe; how its existence is to be reconciled with the admitted wisdom and goodness and omnipotence of God; and how far man is a free agent, or controlled
by an inexorable necessity or destiny, have two sides. On one, they are questions as to the qualities and attributes of God; for we must infer His moral nature from His mode of governing the Universe, and
they ever enter into any consideration His intellectual nature: and on the other, they directly concern the moral responsibility, and therefore the destiny, of man. All important, therefore, in both points of view,
they have been much discussed in all ages of the world, and have no doubt urged men, more than all other questions have, to endeavor to fathom the profound mysteries of the Nature and the mode of
Existence and action of an incomprehensible God.
And, with these, still another question also presents itself; whether the Deity governs the Universe by fixed and unalterable laws, or by special Providences and interferences, so that He may be induced to
change His course and the results of human or material action, by prayer and supplication.
God alone is allpowerful; but the human soul has in all ages asserted its claim to be considered as part of the Divine. "The purity of the spirit", says Van Helmont, "is shown through energy and
efficaciousness of will. God, by the agency of an infinite will, created the Universe, and the same sort of power in an inferior degree, limited more or less by external hindrances, exists in all spiritual
beings". The higher we ascend in antiquity, the more does prayer take the form of incantation; and that form it still in a great degree retains, since the rites of public worship are generally considered not
merely as an expression of trust or reverence, as real spiritual acts, the effect of which is looked for only within the mind of the worshipper, but as acts from which some direct outward result is anticipated, the
attainment of some desired object, of health or wealth, of supernatural gifts for body or soul, of exemption from danger, or vengeance upon enemies. Prayer was able to change the purposes of Heaven,
and to make the Devs tremble under the abyss. It exercised a compulsory influence over the gods. It promoted the magnetic sympathy of spirit with spirit and the Hindu and Persian liturgies, addressed not
only to the Deity Himself, but to His diversified manifestations, were considered wholesome and necessary iterations of the living or creative Word which at first effectuated the divine will, and which
from instant to instant supports the universal frame by its eternal repetition.
In the narrative of the Fall, we have the Hebrew mode of explaining the great moral mystery, the origin of evil and the apparent estrangement from Heaven; and a similar idea, variously modified, obtained in
all the ancient creeds. Everywhere, man had at the beginning been innocent and happy, and had lapsed, by temptation and his own weakness, from his first estate. Thus was accounted for the presumed
connection of increase of knowledge with increase of misery, and, in particular, the great penalty of death was reconciled with Divine Justice. Subordinate to these greater points were the questions, Why
is the earth covered with thorns and weeds? Whence the origin of clothing, of sexual shame and passion? Whence the infliction of labor, and how to justify the degraded condition of woman in the
East, or account for the loathing so generally felt toward the Serpent Tribe?

The hypothesis of a fall, required under some of its modifications in all systems, to account for the apparent imperfection in the work of a Perfect Being, was, in Eastern philosophy, the unavoidable
accompaniment and condition of limited or individual existence; since the Soul, considered as a fragment of the Universal Mind, might be said to have lapsed from its preeminence when parted from
its source, and ceasing to form part of integral perfection. The theory of its reunion was correspondent to the assumed cause of its degradation. To reach its prior condition its individuality must cease; it must
be emancipated by reabsorption into the Infinite, the consummation of all things in God, to bepromoted by human effort in spiritual meditation or selfmortification, and completed in the magical
transformation of death.
And as man had fallen, so it was held that the Angels of Evil had, from their first estate, to which, like men, they were, in God's good time, to be restored and the reign of evil was then to cease forever. To
this great result all the Ancient Theologies point and thus they all endeavored to reconcile the existence of Sin and Evil with the perfect and undeniable wisdom and beneficence of God.
With man's exercise of thought are inseparably connected freedom and responsibility. Man assumes his
proper rank as a moral agent, when with a sense of the limitations of his nature arise the consciousness of freedom, and of the obligations accompanying its exercise, the sense of duty and of the capacity to
perform it. To suppose that man ever imagined himself not to be a free agent until he had argued himself into that belief, would be to suppose that he was in that below the brutes; for he, like them, is
conscious of his freedom to act. Experience alone teaches him that this freedom of action is limited and controlled and when what is outward to him restrains and limits this freedom of action, he instinctively
rebels against it as a wrong. The rule of duty and the materials of experience are derived from an acquaintance with the conditions of the external world, in which the faculties are exerted and thus the
problem of man involves those of Nature and God. Our freedom, we learn by experience, is determined by an agency external to us; our happiness is intimately dependent on the relations of the outward
World, and on the moral character of its Ruler.
Then at once arises this problem: The God of Nature must be One and His character cannot be suspected to be other than good. Whence, then, came the evil, the consciousness of which must in
variably have preceded or accompanied man's moral development? On this subject human opinion has ebbed and flowed between two contradictory extremes, one of which seems inconsistent with God's
Omnipotence, and the other with His beneficence.
If God it was said, is perfectly wise and good, evil must arise from some independent and hostile principle: if, on the other hand, all agencies are subordinate to One, it is difficult, if evil does indeed
exist, if there is any such thing as Evil, to avoid the impiety of making God the Author of it.

The recognition of a moral and physical dualism in nature was adverse to the doctrine of Divine Unity. Many of the Ancients thought it absurd to imagine one Supreme Being, like Homer's Jove, distributing
good and evil out of two urns. They therefore substituted, as we have seen, the doctrine of two distinct and eternal principles; some making the cause of evil to be the inherent imperfection of matter and the
flesh, without explaining how God was not the cause of that; while others personified the required agency, and fancifully invented an Evil Principle, the question of whose origin indeed involved all the
difficulty of the original problem, but whose existence, if once taken for granted, was sufficient as a popular solution of the mystery; the difficulty being supposed no longer to exist when pushed a step
further off, as the difficulty of conceiving the world upheld by an elephant was supposed to be got rid of when it was said that the elephant was supported by a tortoise.
The simpler and probably the older notion, treated the one only God as the Author of all things. "I form
the light,"says Jehovah", and create darkness; I cause prosperity and create evil; I, the Lord, do all these things". "All mankind," says Maximus Tyrius, "are agreed that there exists one only Universal King and
Father, and that the many gods are His Children". There is nothing improbable in the supposition that the primitive idea was that there was but one God. A vague sense of Nature's Unity, blended with a dim
perception of an allpervading Spiritual Essence, has been remarked among the earliest manifestations of the Human Mind. Everywhere it was the dim remembrance, uncertain and indefinite, of the original
truth taught by God to the first men.
The Deity of the Old Testament is everywhere represented as the direct author of Evil, commissioning evil and lying spirits to men, hardening the heart of Pharaoh, and visiting the iniquity of the individual
sinner on the whole people. The rude conception of sternness predominating over mercy in the Deity, can alone account for the human sacrifices, purposed, if not executed, by Abraham and Jephthah. It has
not been uncommon, in any age or country of the world, for men to recognize the existence of one God, without forming any becoming estimate of His dignity. The causes of both good and ill are referred to a
mysterious centre, to which each assigns such attributes as correspond with his own intellect and advance in civilization. Hence the assignment to the Deity of the feelings of envy and jealousy. Hence
the provocation given by the healing skill of AEsculapius and the humane theft of fire by Prometheus. The very spirit of Nature, personified in Orpheus, Tantalus, or Phineus was supposed to have been
killed, confined, or blinded, for having too freely divulged the Divine Mysteries to mankind. This Divine Envy still exists in a modified form, and varies according to circumstances. In Hesiod it appears
in the lowest type of human malignity. In the God of Moses, it is jealousy of the infringement of the autocratic power, the check to political treason; and even the penalties denounced for worshipping other
gods often seem dictated rather by a jealous regard for His own greatness in Deity, than by the immorality and degraded nature of the worship itself. In Herodotus and other writers it assumes a more
philosophical shape, as a strict adherence to a moral equilibrium in the government of the world, in the punishment of pride, arrogance and insolent pretension.
God acts providentially in Nature by regular and universal laws, by constant modes of operation; and so

takes care of material things without violating their constitution, acting always according to the nature of the things which He has made. It is a fact of observation that, in the material and unconscious world,
He works by its materiality and unconsciousness, not against them; in the animal world, by its animality and partial consciousness, not against them. So in the providential government of the world, He acts by
regular and universal laws, and constant modes of operation and so takes care of human things without violating their constitution, acting always according to the human nature of man, not against it, working
in the human world by means of man's consciousness and partial freedom, not against them.
God acts by general laws for general purposes. The attraction of gravitation is a good thing, for it keeps the world together and if the tower of Siloam, thereby falling to the ground slays eighteen men of
Jerusalem, that number is too small to think of, considering the myriad millions who are upheld by the same law. It could not well be repealed for their sake, and to hold up that tower; nor could it remain in
force, and the tower stand.
It is difficult to conceive of a Perfect Will without confounding it with something like mechanism; since language has no name for that combination of the Inexorable with the Moral, which the old poets
personified separately in Ananke or Eimarmene and Zeus. How combine understandingly the Perfect Freedom of the Supreme and AllSovereign Will of God with the inflexible necessity, as part of His
Essence, that He should and must continue to be, in all His great attributes, of justice and mercy for example, what He is now and always has been, and with the impossibility of His changing His nature
and becoming unjust, merciless, cruel, fickle, or of His repealing the great moral laws which make crime wrong and the practice of virtue right?
For all that we familiarly know of FreeWill is that capricious exercise of it which we experience in
ourselves and other men; and therefore the notion of Supreme Will, still guided by Infallible Law, even if that law be selfimposed, is always in danger of being either stripped of the essential quality of
Freedom, or degraded under the illname of Necessity to something of even less moral and intellectual dignity than the fluctuating course of human operations.
It is not until we elevate the idea of law above that of partiality or tyranny, that we discover that the self
imposed limitations of the Supreme Cause, constituting an array of certain alternatives, regulating moral choice, are the very sources and safeguards of human freedom; and the doubt recurs, whether we
do not set a law above God Himself; or whether laws selfimposed may not be selfrepealed: and if not, what power prevents it.
The Zeus of Homer, like that of Hesiod, is an array of antitheses, combining strength with weakness,
wisdom with folly, universal parentage with narrow family limitation, omnipotent control over events with submission to a superior destiny, DESTINY, a name by means of which the theological problem

was cast back into the original obscurity out of which the powers of the human mind have proved themselves as incapable of rescuing it, as the efforts of a fly caught in a spider's web to do more than
increase its entanglement.
The oldest notion of Deity was rather indefinite than repulsive. The positive degradation was of later growth. The God of nature reflects the changeful character of the seasons, varying from dark to bright.
Alternately angry and serene, and lavishing abundance which she again withdraws, nature seems inexplicably capricious, and though capable of responding to the highest requirements of the moral
sentiment through a general comprehension of her mysteries, more liable by a partial or hasty view to become darkened into a Siva, a Saturn, or a Mexitli, a patron of fierce orgies or bloodstained altars. All
the older poetical personifications exhibit traces of this ambiguity. They are neither wholly immoral nor purely beneficent.
No people have ever deliberately made their Deity a malevolent or guilty Being. The simple piety which
ascribed the origin of all things to God, took all in good part, trusting and hoping all things. The Supreme Ruler was at first looked up to with unquestioning reverence. No startling discords or
contradictions had yet raised a doubt as to His beneficence, or made men dissatisfied with His government. Fear might cause anxiety, but could not banish hope, still less inspire aversion. It was only
later, when abstract notions began to assume the semblance of realities, and when new or more distinct ideas suggested new words for their expression, that it became necessary to fix a definite barrier
between Evil and Good.
To account for moral evil, it became necessary to devise some new expedient suited both to the piety and selfcomplacency of the inventor, such as the perversity of woman, or an agent distinct from God, a
Typhon or Ahriman, obtained either by dividing the Gods into two classes, or by dethroning the Ancient Divinity, and changing him into a Dev or Daemon.
Through a similar want, the Orientals devised the inherent corruption of the fleshy and material; the
Hebrew transferred to Satan everything illegal and immoral; and the Greek reflection, occasionally adopting the older and truer view, retorted upon man the obloquy cast on these creatures of his
imagination, and showed how he has to thank himself alone for his calamities, while his good things are the voluntary gifts, not the plunder of Heaven. Homer had already made Zeus exclaim, in the Assembly
of Olympus, "Grievous it is to hear these mortals accuse the Gods; they pretend that evils come from us; but they themselves occasion them gratuitously by their own wanton folly". "It is the fault of man",
said Solon; in reference to the social evils of his day, "not of God, that destruction comes" and Euripides, after a formal discussion of the origin of evil, comes to the conclusion that men act wrongly,
not from want of natural good sense and feeling, but because knowing what is good, they yet for various reasons neglect to practice it.

And at last reaching the highest truth, Pindar, Hesiod, AEschylus, AEsop and Horace said, "All virtue is a struggle; life is not a scene of repose, but of energetic action. Suffering is but another name for the
teaching of experience, appointed by Zeus himself, the giver of all understanding, to be the parent of instruction, the schoolmaster of life. He indeed put an end to the golden age; he gave venom to serpents
and predacity to wolves; he shook the honey from the leaf, and stopped the flow of wine in the rivulets; he concealed the element of fire, and made the means of life scanty and precarious. But in all this his
object was beneficent; it was not to destroy life, but to improve it. It was a blessing to man, not a curse, to be sentenced to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow; for nothing great or excellent is attainable
without exertion; safe and easy virtues are prized neither by gods nor men and the parsimoniousness of nature is justified by its powerful effect in rousing the dormant faculties and forcing on mankind the
invention of useful arts by means of meditation and thought".
Ancient religious reformers pronounced the worship of "idols" to be the root of all evil and there have been many iconoclasts in different ages of the world. The maxim still holds good; for the worship of
idols, that is, of fanciful conceits, if not the source of all evil, is still the cause of much; and it prevails as extensively now as it ever did. Men are ever engaged in worshipping the picturesque fancies of their
own imaginations.
Human wisdom must always be limited and incorrect and even right opinion is only a something intermediate between ignorance and knowledge. The normal condition of man is that of progress.
Philosophy is a kind of journey, ever learning, yet never arriving at the ideal perfection of truth. A Mason should, like the wise Socrates, assume the modest title of a "lover of wisdom" for he must ever
long after something more excellent than he possesses, something still beyond his reach, which he desires to make eternally his own.
Thus the philosophic sentiment came to be associated with the poetical and the religious, under the
comprehensive name of Love. Before the birth of Philosophy, Love had received but scanty and inadequate homage. This mightiest and most ancient of gods, coeval with the existence of religion and
of the world, had been indeed unconsciously felt, but had neither been worthily honored nor directly celebrated in hymn or paean. In the old days of ignorance it could scarcely have been recognized. In
order that it might exercise its proper influence over religion and philosophy, it was necessary that the God of Nature should cease to be a God of terrors, a personification of mere Power or arbitrary Will, a
pure and stern Intelligence, an inflictor of evil, and an unrelenting Judge. The philosophy of Plato, in which this charge became forever established, was emphatically a mediation of Love. With him, the
inspiration of Love first kindled the light of arts and imparted them to mankind and not only the arts of mere existence, but the heavenly art of wisdom, which supports the Universe. It inspires high and
generous deeds and noble self devotion.
Without it, neither State nor individual could do anything beautiful or great. Love is our best pilot,

confederate, supporter and saviour; the ornament and governor of all things human and divine; and he with divine harmony forever soothes the minds of men and gods.
Man is capable of a higher Love, which, marrying mind with mind and with the Universe, brings forth
all that is noblest in his faculties and lifts him beyond himself. This higher love is neither mortal nor immortal, but a power intermediate between the human and the Divine, filling up the mighty interval,
an binding the Universe together. He is chief of those celestial emissaries who carry to the gods the prayers of men and bring down to men the gifts of the gods. "He is forever poor, and far from being
beautiful as mankind imagine, for he is squalid and withered; he flies low along the ground, is homeless and unsandalled; sleeping without covering before the doors and in the unsheltered streets, and
possessing so far his mother's nature as being ever the companion of want. Yet, sharing also that of his father, he is forever scheming to obtain things good and beautiful; he is fearless, vehement and strong;
always devising some new contrivance strictly cautious and full of inventive resource; a philosopher through his whole existence, a powerful enchanter, and a subtle sophist."
The ideal consummation of Platonic science is the arrival at the contemplation of that of which earth
exhibits no express image or adequate similitude, the Supreme Prototype of all beauty, pure and uncontaminated with human intermixture of flesh or colour, the Divine Original itself. To one so
qualified is given the prerogative of bringing forth not mere images and shadows of virtue, but virtue itself, as having been conversant not with shadows, but with the truth and having so brought forth and
nurtured a progeny of virtue, he becomes the friend of God, and, so far as such a privilege can belong to any human being, immortal.
Socrates believed, like Heraclitus, in a Universal Reason pervading all things and all minds, and
consequently revealing itself in ideas. He therefore sought truth in general opinion, and perceived in the communication of mind with mind one of the greatest prerogatives of wisdom and the most powerful
means of advancement. He believed true wisdom to be an attainable idea, and that the moral convictions of the mind, those eternal instincts of temperance, conscientiousness, and justice, implanted
in it by the gods, could not deceive, if rightly interpreted.
This metaphysical direction given to philosophy ended in visionary extravagance. Having assumed truth to be discoverable in thought, it proceeded to treat thoughts as truths. It thus became an idolatry of
notions, which it considered either as phantoms exhaled from objects, or as portions of the divine preexistent thought; this creating a mythology of its own, and escaping from one thraldom only to
enslave itself afresh.
Theories and notions indiscriminately formed and defended are the false gods or "idols" of philosophy. For the word idolon means image, and a false mindpicture of God is as much an idol as a false wooden

506/641
image of Him. Fearlessly launching into the problem of universal being, the first philosophy attempted to supply a compendious and decisive solution of every doubt. To do this, it was obliged to make the
most sweeping assumptions; and as poetry had already filled the vast void between the human and the divine, by personifying its Deity as man, so philosophy bowed down before the supposed reflection of
the divine image in the mind of the inquirer, who, in worshipping his own notions, had unconsciously deified himself. Nature thus was enslaved to common notions, and notions very often to words.
By the clashing of incompatible opinions, philosophy was gradually reduced to the ignominious
confession of utter incapacity, and found its check or intellectual fall in skepticism. Xenophanes and Heraclitus mournfully acknowledged the unsatisfactory result of all the struggles of philosophy, in the
admission of a universality of doubt and the memorable effort of Socrates to rally the discomfited champions of truth, ended in a similar confession.
The worship of abstractions continued the error which personified Evil or deified Fortune; and when
mystical philosophy resigned its place to mystical religion, it changed not its nature, but only its name. The great task remained unperformed, of reducing the outward world and its principles to the dominion
of the intellect, and of reconciling the conception of the supreme unalterable power asserted by reason, with the requisitions of human sympathies.
A general idea of purpose and regularity in nature had been suggested by common appearances to the
earliest reflection. The ancients perceived a natural order, a divine legislation, from which human institutions were supposed to be derived, laws emblazoned in Heaven and thence revealed to earth. But
the divine law was little more than an analogical inference from human law, taken in the vulgar sense of arbitrary will or partial covenant. It was surmised rather than discovered, and remained unmoral
because unintelligible. It mattered little, under the circumstances, whether the Universe were said to be governed by chance or by reason, since the latter, if misunderstood, was virtually one with the former.
"Better far" said Epicurus, "acquiesce in the fables of tradition, than acknowledge the oppressive
necessity of the physicists" and Menander speaks of God, Chance, and Intelligence as undistinguishable. Law unacknowledged goes under the name of Chance; perceived, but not
understood, it becomes Necessity. The wisdom of the Stoic was a dogged submission to the arbitrary behests of one; that of the Epicurean an advantage snatched by more or less dexterous management
from the equal tyranny of the other.
Ignorance sees nothing necessary and is self abandoned to a power tyrannical because defined by no rule, and paradoxical because permitting evil, while itself assumed to be unlimited, all powerful, and
perfectly good. A little knowledge, presuming the identification of the Supreme Cause with the inevitable certainty of perfect reason, but omitting the analysis or interpretation of it, leaves the mind

chainbound in the ascetic fatalism of the Stoic. Freewill, coupled with the universal rule of Chance; or Fatalism and Necessity, coupled with Omniscience and fixed and unalterable Law, these are the
alternatives, between which the human mind has eternally vacillated. The Supernaturalists, contemplating a Being acting through impulse, though with superhuman wisdom, and considering the
best courtier to be the most favored subject, combines contradictory expedients, inconsistently mixing tlle assertion of free action with the enervating service of petition; while he admits, in the words of a
learned archbishop, that "if the production of the things we ask for depend on antecedent, natural, and necessary causes, our desires will be answered no less by the omission than the offering of prayers,
which, therefore, are a vain thing."
The last stage is that in which the religion of action is made legitimate through comprehension of its proper objects and contiditions. Man becomes morally free only when both notions, that of Chance and
that of incomprehensible Necessity, are displaced by that of Law. Law, as applied to the Universe, means that universal, providential prearrangement, whose conditions can be discerned and
discretionally acted on by human intelligence. The sense of freedom arises when the individual independence develops itself according to its own laws, without external collisions or hindrance; that of
constraint, where it is thwarted or confined by other Natures, or where, by combination of external forces, the individual force is compelled into a new direction. Moral choice would not exist safely, or
even at all, unless it were bounded by conditions determining its preferences. Duty supposes a rule both intelligible and certain, since an uncertain rule would be unintelligible, and if unintelligible, there could
be no responsibility. No law that is unknown can be obligatory and that Roman Emperor was justly execrated, who pretended to promulgate his penal laws, by putting them up at such a height that none
could read them.
Man commands results, only by selecting among the contingent the preordained results most suited to his purposes. In regard to absolute or divine morality, meaning the final cause or purpose of those
comprehensive laws which often seem harsh to the individual, because inflexibly just and impartial to the universal, speculation must take refuge in faith; the immediate and obvious purpose often bearing
so small a proportion to a wider and unknown one, as to be relatively absorbed or lost. The rain that, unseasonable to me, ruins my hopes of an abundant crop, does so because it could not otherwise have
blessed and prospered the crops of another kind of a whole neighboring district of country. The obvious purpose of a sudden storm of snow, or an unexpected change of wind, exposed to which I lose my life,
bears small proportion to the great results which are to flow from that storm or wind over a whole continent.
So always, of the good all ill which at first seemed irreconcilable and capriciously distributed, the one
holds its ground, the other diminishes by being explained. In a world of a multitude of individuals, a world of action and exertion, a world affording, by the conflict of interests and the clashing of passions,
any scope for the exercise of the manly and generous virtues, even Omnipotence cannot make it, that the comfort and convenience of one man alone shall always be consulted.

Thus the educated mind soon begins to appreciate the moral superiority of a system of law over one of
capricious interference and as the jumble of means and ends is brought into more intelligible perspective, partial or seeming good is cheerfully resigned for the disinterested and universal.
Selfrestraint is found not to imply selfsacrifice. The true meaning of what appeared to be Necessity is
found to be, not arbitrary Power, but Strength and Force enlisted in the service of Intelligence. God having made us men, and placed us in a world of change and eternal renovation, with ample capacity
and abundant means for rational enjoyment, we learn that it is folly to repine because we are not angels, inhabiting a world in which change and the clashing of interest and the conflicts of passion are
unknown.
The mystery of the world remains, but is sufficiently cleared up to inspire confidence. We are constrained to admit that if every man would but do the best in his power to do and that which he knows
he ought to do, we should need no better world than this. Man surrounded by necessity, is free, not in a dogged determination of isolated will, because though inevitably complying with nature's laws, he is
able, proportionately to his knowledge, to modify, in regard to himself, the conditions of their action, and so to preserve an average uniformity between their forces and his own.
Such are some of the conflicting opinions of antiquity and we have to some extent presented to you a
picture of the Ancient Thought. Faithful, as far as it goes, it exhibits to us Man's Intellect ever struggling to pass beyond the narrow bounds of the circle in which its limited powers and its short
vision confine it, and ever we find it travelling round the circle. like one lost in a wood, to meet the same unavoidable and insoluble ditfficulties. Science with her many instruments, Astronomy,
particularly, with her telescope, Physics with the microscope, and Chemistry with its analyses and combinations, have greatly enlarged our ideas of the Deity, by discovering to us the vast extent of the
Universe in both directions, its starsystems and its invisible swarms of minutest animal life; by acquainting us with the new and wonderful Force or Substance we call Electricity, apparently a link
between Matter and Spirit and still the Deity only becomes more incomprehensible to us than ever, and we find that in our speculations we but reproduce over and over again the Ancient Thought.
Where, then, amid all these conflicting opinions, is the True Word of a Mason?
My Brother, most of the questions which have thus tortured men's minds, it is not within the reach and
grasp of the Human Intellect to understand; but without understanding, as we have explained to you heretofore, we may and must believe.

The True Word of a Mason is to be found in the concealed and profound meaning of the Ineffable Name of Deity, communicated by God to Moses and which meaning was long lost by the very
precautions taken to conceal it. The true pronunciation of that was in truth a secret, in which, however, was involved the far more profound secret of its meaning. In that meaning is included all the truth than
can be known by us, in regard to the nature of God.
Long known as AL, AL SCHADAI, ALOHAYIM, and ADONAI; as the Chief or Commander of the Heavenly Armies; as the aggregate of the Forces [ALOHAYIM] of Nature; as the Mighty, the
Victorious, the Rival of Bal and Osiris; as the Soul of Nature, Nature itself, a God that was but Man personified, a God with human passions, the God of the Heathen with but a mere change of name, He
assumes, in His communications to Moses, the name IHUH, and says to Him, AHIH ASHR AHIH, I AM WHAT I AM. Let us examine the esoteric or inner, meaning of this Ineffable Name.
HIH is the imperfect tense of the verb TO BE, of which IHIH is the present; AHI being the personal
pronoun "I" affixed the first person by apocope; and IHI the third. The verb has the following forms: Preterite, 3rd person, masculine, singular, HIH did exist, was 3rd person com. plural, HIU Present, 3rd
person, masculine, singular. IHIH, once IHUA, by apocope AHI, IHI Infinitive, HIH, HIU Imperative, 2nd person, masculine, singular. HIH, feminine, HUI Participle, masculine, singular;
HUH, ENS EXISTING, EXISTENCE.
The verb is never used, as the mere logical copula or connecting word, is, was, etc., is used with the Greeks, Latins, and ourselves. It always implies existence, actuality. The present form also includes the
future sense, shall or may be or exist. And HUH and HUA Chaldaic forms of the imperfect tense of the verb are the same as the Hebrew HUH and HIH and means was, existed, became.
Now HUA and HIA are the Personal Pronoun [Masculine and Feminine], HE, SHE. Thus in Gen. iv. 20
we have the phrase, HUA HIH, HE WAS: and in Lev. xxi. 9, ATH ABIH HIA, HER Father. This feminine pronoun, however, is often written HUA, and HIA occurs only eleven times in the Pentateuch.
Sometimes the feminine form means IT; but that pronoun is generally in the masculine form.
When either Yod, Vav, He, or Aleph terminates a word and has no vowel either immediately preceding or following it, it is often rejected; as in GI, for GIA, a valley.
So HUAHIA, HeShe, could properly be written HUHI; or by transposition of the letters, common
with the Talmudists, IHUH, which is the Tetragrammaton or Ineffable Name.
In Gen. i. 27, it is said, "So the ALHIM created man in His image; in the image of ALHIM created He

510/641
him: MALE and FEMALE created He them."
Sometimes the word was thus expressed triangularly:
And we learn that this designation of the Ineffable Name was, among the Hebrews, a symbol of Creation. The mysterious union of God with His creatures was in the letter , which they considered to
be the Agent of Almighty Power; and to enable the possessor of the Name to work miracles.
The Personal Pronoun HUA, HE, is often used by itself, to express the Deity. Lee says that in such cases, IHUH, IH, or ALHIM, or some other name of God, is understood; but there is no necessity for
that. It means in such cases the Male, Generative, or Creative Principle or Power.
It was a common practice with the Talmudists to conceal secret meanings and sounds of words by transposing the letters.
The reversal of the letters of words was, indeed, anciently common everywhere. Thus from Neitha, the
name of an Egyptian Goddess, the Greeks, writing backward, formed Athene, the name of Minerva. In Arabic we have Nahid, a name of the planet Venus, which, reversed, gives Dihan, Greek, in Persian,
Nihad, Nature; which Sir William Jones writes also Nahid. Strabo informs us that the Armenian name of Venus was Anaitis.
Tien, Heaven, in Chinese; reversed is Neit or Neith, worshipped at Sais in Egypt. Reverse Neitha, drop
the i, and add an e, and we, as before said, Athene. Mitra was the name of Venus among the ancient Persians. Herodotus, who tells us this, also informs us that her name, among the Scythians, was Artim
pasa. Artim is Mitra, reversed. So, by reversing it, the Greeks formed Artemis, Diana.
One of the meanings of Rama, in Sanscrit, is Kama, the Deity of Love. Reverse this, and we have Amar, and by changing a into o, Amor, the Latin word for Love. Probably, as the verb is Amare, the
oldest reading was Amar and not Amor. So Dipaka, in Sanscrit, one of the meanings whereof is love, is often written Dipuc. Reverse this, and we have, adding "o", the Latin word Cupido.
In Arabic, the radical letters rhm, pronounced rahm, signify the trunk, compassion, mercy; this
reversed, we have mhr, in Persic, love and the Sun. In Hebrew we have Lab, the heart and in Chaldee, Bal, the heart; the radical letters of both being "b" and "l".

511/641
The Persic word for head is Sar. Reversed, this becomes Ras in Arabic and Hebrew, Raish in Chaldee, Rash in Samaritan, and Ryas in Ethiopic; all meaning head, chief, etc. In Arahic we have Kid, in the
sense of rule, regulation, article of agreement, obligation; which, reversed, becomes, adding "e", the Greek dike justice. In Coptic we have Chlom, a crown. Reversed, we have in Hebrew, Moloch or Malec,
a King or he who wears a crown.
In the Kouonen or oldest Chinese writing, by Hieroglyphics, Ge [Hi or Khi, with the initial letter modified], was the Sun; in Persic, Gaw: and in Turkish Giun. Yue was the Moon; in Sanscrit Uh, and in
Turkish Ai. It will be remembered in Egypt and elsewhere, the Sun was originally feminine, and the Moon masculine. In Egypt, Ioh was the moon: and in the feasl of Bacchus they cried incessantly, Euoi
Sabvi! Euoi Bakhe! Io Bakhe! Io Bakhe!
Bunsen gives the following personal pronouns for he and she:
He, She Christian Aramaic Hu Hi. Jewish Aramaic Hu Hi. Hebrew Hu' Hi'.
Arabic Huwa Hiya
Thus the Ineffable Name not only embodies the Great Philosophical Idea, that the Deity is the ENS, the
To ON, the Absolute Existence, that of which the Essence is To Exist, the only Substance of Spinoza, the BEING, that never could not have existed, as contradistinguished from that which only becomes,
not Nature or the Soul of Nature, but that which created Nature; but also the idea of the Male and Female Principles, in its highest a most profound sense; to wit, that God originally comprehended in
Himself all that is: that matter was not coexistent with Him, or independent of Him; that He did not merely fashion a shape a preexisting chaos into a Universe; but that His Thought manifested itself
outwardly in that Universe, which so became, and before was not, except as comprehended in Him: that the Generative Power or Spirit, and Productive Matter, ever among the ancients deemed the Female,
originally were in God; and that He WAS and IS all that Was, that IS, and that Shall be; in Whom all else lives, moves, and has its being.
This was the great Mystery of the Ineffable Name and this true arrangement of its letters, and of course
its true pronunciation and its meaning, soon became lost to all except select few to whom it was confided; it being concealed from common people, because the Deity thus metaphysically named was
not that personal and capricious, and as it were tangible God in whom they believed, and who alone was within the reach of their rude capacities.
Diodorus says that the name given by Moses to God was IAQ, Theodorus says that the Samaritans
termed God IABE, but the Jews IAQ. Philo Byblius gives the form IEYQ and Clemens of Alexandria

IAOY. Macrobius says that it was an admitted axiom among the Heathen, that the triliteral IAQ was the sacred name of the Supreme God. And the Clarian oracle said: "Learn thou that IAQ is the great God
Supreme, that ruleth over all". The letter "I" signified Unity. "A" and "Q" are the first and last letters of the Greek Alphabet.
Hence the frequent expression: "I am the First, and I am the Last and besides Me there is no other God.
I am A and Q, the First and the Last. I am "A" and "Q", the Beginning and the Ending, which IS, and Was, and IS to come; the Omnipotent". For in this we see shadowed forth the same great truth; that God
is all in all the Cause and the Effect the beginning, or Impulse, or Generative Power: and the Ending, or Result, or that which is produced: that He is in reality all that is, all that ever was, and all that ever will
be; in this sense, that nothing besides Himself has existed eternally, and coeternally with Him, independent of Him, and selfexistent, or selforiginated.
And thus the meaning of the expression, ALOHAYIM, a plural noun used in the account of the
Creation With which Genesis commences, with a singular verb, and of the name or title IHUH ALHIM, used for the first time in the 4th verse of the 2d chapter of the same book, becomes clear. The ALHIM
is the aggregate unity of the manifested Creative Forces or Powers of Deity, His Emanations; and IHUHALHIM is the ABSOLUTE Existence, or Essence of these Powers and Forces, of which they are
Active Manifestations and Emanations.
This was the profound truth hidden in the ancient allegory and covered from the general view with a double veil. This was the esoteric meaning of the generation and production of the Indian, Chaldean,
and Phoenician cosmognies and the Active and Passive Powers, of the Male and Female Principles; of Heaven and its Luminaries generating, and the Earth producing; all hiding from vulgar view, as above
its comprehension, the doctrine that matter is not eternal, but that God was the only original Existence, the ABSOLUTE, from Whom everything has proceeded, and to Whom all returns and that all moral
law springs not from the relation of things, but from His Wisdom and Essential Justice, as the Omnipotent Legislator. And this TRUE WORD is with entire accuracy said to have been lost; because
its meaning was lost even among the Hebrews, although we still find the name (its real meaning unsuspected), in the Hu of the Druids and the Fo HI of the Chinese.
When we conceive of the Absolute Truth, Beauty, or Good, cannot stop short at the abstraction of
either. We are forced to refer each to some living and substantial Being, in which they have their foundations, some being that is the first and last priciple of each.
Moral Truth, like every other universal and necessary truth, cannot remain a mere abstraction.
Abstractions are unrealities. In ourselves, moral truth is merely conceived of. There must be somewhere a Being that not only conceives of, but constitutes it. It has this characteristic; that it is not only, to the

eyes of our intelligence, an universal and necessary truth, but one obligatory on our will. It is A LAW. We do not establish that law ourselves. It is imposed on us despite ourselves: its principle must be
without us. It supposes a legislator. He cannot be the being to whom the law applies; but must be one that possesses in the highest degree all the characteristics of moral truth. The moral law, universal and
necessary, necessarily has as its author a necessary being; composed of justice and charity, its author must be a being possessing the plenitude of both.
As all beautiful and all true things refer themselves, these a Unity which is absolute TRUTH, and those
to a Unity which absolute BEAUTY, so all the moral principles centre in a single principle, which is THE GOOD. Thus we arrive at the conception of THE GOOD in itself, the ABSOLUTE Good,
superior to all particular duties, and determinate in those duties. This Absolute Good must necessarily be an attribute of the Absolute Being.
There cannot be several Absolute Beings; the one in whom is realized Absolute Truth and Absolute
Beauty being different from the one in whom is realized Absolute Good. The Absolute necessarily implies absolute Unity. The True, the Beautiful, and Good are not three distinct essences: but they are
one and same essence, considered in its fundamental attributes; the different phases which in our eyes, the Absolute and Infinite Perfection assumes.
Manifested in the World of the Finite and Relative, these three attributes separate from each other, and
are distinguished by our minds, which can comprehend nothing except by division. But in the Being from Whom they emanate, they are indivisibly united; and this Being, at once triple and one, Who
sums up in Himself perfect Beauty) perfect Truth, and the perfect Good, is GOD.
God is necessarily the principle of Moral Truth, and of personal morality. Man is a moral person, that is to say, one endowed with reason and liberty. He is capable of virtue and virtue has with him two
principal forms, respect for others and love of others, justice and charity.
The creature can possess no real and essential attribute which the Creator does not possess. The effect can draw its reality and existence only from its cause. The cause contains in itself, at least, what is
essential in the effect. The characteristic of the effect is inferiority, shortcoming, imperfection. Dependent and derivate, it bears in itself the marks and conditions of dependence; and its imperfection
proves the perfection of the cause; or else there would be in the effect something immanent, without a cause.
God is not a logical Being, whose Nature may be explained by deduction, and by means of algebraic
equations. When, setting out with a primary attribute, the attributes of God are deduced one from the other, after the manner of the Geometricians and Scholastics, we have nothing but abstractions. We

must emerge from this empty dialetic, to arrive at a true and living God. The first notion which we have of God, that of an Infinite Being, is not given us a priori, independently of all experience. It is our
consciousness of ourself, as at once a Being and a limited Being, that immediately raises us to the conception of a Being, the principle of our being, and Himself without limits. If the existence that we
possess forces us to recur to a cause possessing the same existence in an infinite degree, all the substantial attributes of existence that we possess equally require each an infinite cause. God, then, is
no longer the Infinite, Abstract, Indeterminate Being, of which reason and the heart cannot lay hold, but a real Being, determinate like ourselves, a moral person like ourself; and the study of our own souls will
conduct us, without resort to hypothesis, to a conception of God, both sublime and having a connection with ourselves.
If man be free, God must be so. It would be strange if, while the creature has that marvellous power of
disposing of himself, of choosing and willing freely, the Being that has made him should he subject to a necessary development, the cause of which, though in Himself, is a sort of abstract, mechanical, or
metaphysical power, inferior to the personal, voluntary cause which we are, and of which we have the clearest consciousness. God is free because we are; but he is not free as we are.
He is at once everything that we are and nothing that we are. He possesses the same attributes as we,
but extended to infinity. He possesses, then, an infinite liberty, united to an infinite intelligence; and as His intelligence is infallible, exempt from the uncertainty of deliberation, and perceiving at a glance
where the Good is, so His liberty accomplishes it spontaneously and without effort.
As we assign to God that liberty which is the basis of our existence, so also we transfer to His character from our own, justice and charity. In man they are virtues in God, His attributes. What is in us the
laborious conquest of liberty, is in Him His very nature. The idea of the right, and the respect paid to the right, are signs of the dignity of our existence.
If respect of rights is the very essence of justice, the Perfect Being must know and respect the rights of
the lowest of His creatures; for He assigned them those rights. In God resides a sovereign justice, that renders to every one what is due him, not according to deceitful appearances, but according to the truth
of things. And if man, a limited being, has the power to go out of himself, to forget his own person, to love another like himself, and devote himself to his happiness, dignity, and perfection, the Perfect Being
must have, in an infinite degree, that disinterested tenderness, that Charity, the Supreme virtue of the human person. There is in God an infinite tenderness for His creatures, manifested in His giving us
existence, which He might have withheld and every day it appears in innumerable marks of His Divine Providence.
Plato well understood that love of God and expresses it in these great words: "Let us speak of the cause

515/641
which led the Supreme Arranger of the Universe to produce and regulate that Universe. He was good and he who is good has no kind of ill will. Exempt from that, He willed that created things should be,
as far as possible, like Himself". And Christianity in its turn said, "God has so loved men that He has given them His only Son".
It is not correct to affirm, as is often done, that Christianity has in some sort discovered this noble
sentiment. We must not lower human nature, to raise Christianity. Antiquity knew, described, and practised charity; the first feature of which, so touching, and thank God! so common, is goodness, as its
loftiest one is heroism. Charity is devotion to another; and it is ridiculously senseless to pretend that there ever was an age of the world, when the human soul was deprived of that part of its heritage, the
power of devotion. But it is certain that Christianity has diffused and popularized this virtue and that before Christ, these words were never spoken: LOVE ONE ANOTHER; FOR THAT IS THE WHOLE
LAW. Charity presupposes Justice. He who truly loves his brother respects the rights of his brother; but he does more, he forgets his own. Egoism sells or takes. Love delights in giving. In God, love is what it
is in us; but in an infinite degree. God is inexhaustible in His charity, as He is inexhaustible in His essence. That Infinite Omnipotence and Infinite Charity, which, by an admirable goodwill, draws from
the bosom of its immense love the favors which it incessantly bestows on the world and on humanity, teaches us that the more we give, the more we possess.
God being all just and all good, He can will nothing but what is good and just. Being Omnipotent,
whatever He wills He can do, and consequently does. The world is the work of God; it is therefore perfectly made.
Yet there is disorder in the world, that seems to impugn the justice and goodness of God.
A principle indissolubly connected with the very idea of good, tells us that every moral agent deserves
reward when he does well, and punishment when he does ill. This principle is universal and necessary. It is absolute. If it does not apply in this world, it is false, or the world is badly ordered.
But good actions are not always followed by happiness, nor evil ones by misery. Though often this fact
is more apparent than real; though virtue, a war against the passions, full of dignity but full of sorrow and pain, has the latter as its condition, yet the pains that follow vice are greater; and virtue conduces
most to health, strength, and long life; though the peaceful conscience that accompanies virtue creates internal happiness; though public opinion generally decides correctly on men's characters, and rewards
virtue with esteem and consideration, and vice with contempt and infamy; and though, after all, justice reigns in the world, and the surest road to happiness is still that of virtue, yet there are exceptions.
Virtue is not always rewarded, nor vice punished, in this life.

The data of this problem are these: 1st. The principle of merit and demerit within us is absolute; every good action ought to rewarded, every bad one punished; 2nd. God is just as He is al powerful; 3rd.
There are in this world particular cases, contradicting the necessary and universal law of merit and demerit. What is the result?
To reject the two principles, that God is just, and the law merit and demerit absolute, is to raze to the
foundations the whole edifice of human faith.
To maintain them, is to admit that the present life is to terminated or continued elsewhere. The moral person who acts well or ill, and awaits reward or punishment, is connected with a body, lives with it,
makes use of it, depends upon it in a meas but is not it. The body is composed of parts. It diminishes or increases, it is divisible even to infinity. But this something which has a consciousness of itself, and
says "I, ME"; that feels itself free and responsible, feels too that it is incapable of division, that it is a being one and simple; that the ME cannot be halved, that if a limb is cut off and thrown away, no part
of the ME, goes with it; that it remains identical with itself under the variety phenomena which successively manifest it. This identity, indivisibility, and absolute unity of the person, are its spirituality,
the very essence of the person.
It is not in the least an hypothesis to affirm that the soul differs essentially from the body. By the soul we mean the person, not separated from the consciousnes of the attributes which constitute it, thought
and will. The Existence without consciousness is an abstract being, and not a person. It is the person, that is identical, one, simple. Its attributes, developing it, do not divide it. Indivisible, it is indissoluble,
and may be immortal. If absolute justice requires this immortality, it does not require what is impossible. The spirituality of the soul is the condition and necessary foundation of immortality; the
law of merit and demerit the direct demonstration of it. The first is the metaphysical, the second the moral proof. Add to these the tendency of all the powers of the soul toward the Infinite, and the
principle of final causes, and the proof of the immortality of the soul is complete.
God, therefore, in the Masonic creed, is INFINITE TRUTH, INFINITE BEAUTY, INFINITE GOODNESS. He is the Holy of Holies, as Author of the Moral Law, as the PRINCIPLE of Liberty, of
Justice, and of Charity, Dispenser of Reward and Punishment. Such a God is not an abstract God; but an intelligent and free person, Who has made us in His image, from Whom we receive the law that
presides over our destiny, and Whose judgment we await. It is His love that inspires us in our acts of charity. It is His justice that governs our justice, and that of society and the laws. We continually remind
ourselves that He is infinite; because otherwise we should degrade His nature; but He would be for us as if He were not, if His infinite nature had not forms inherent in ourselves, the forms of our own reason
and soul.

When we love Truth, Justice, and Nobility of Soul, we should know that it is God we love underneath these special forms, and should unite them all into one great act of total piety. We should feel that we go
in and out continually in the midst of the vast forces of the Universe, which are only the Forces of God; that in our studies, when we attain a truth, we confront the thought of God; when we learn the right, we
learn the will of God laid down as a rule of conduct for the Universe; and when we feel disinterested love, we should know that we partake the feeling of the Infinite God. Then, when we reverence the
mighty cosmic force, it will not be a blind Fate in an Atheistic or Pantheistic world, but the Infinite God, that we shall confront and feel and know. Then we shall be mindflll of the mind of God, conscious
of God's conscience, sensible of His sentiments, and our own existence will be in the infinite being of God.
The world is a whole, which has its harmony; for a God who is One, could make none but a complete
and harmonious work. The harmony of the Universe responds to the unity of God, as the indefinite quantity is the definite sign of the infinitude of God. To say that the Universe is God, is to admit the
world only, and On the other hand, to suppose that the Universe is void of God, and that He is wholly apart from it, is an insupportable and almost impossible abstraction. To distinguish is not to separate. I
distinguish, but do not separate myself from my qualities and effects. So God is not the Universe, although He is everywhere present in spirit and in truth.
To us, as to Plato, absolute truth is in God. It is God Himself under one of His phases. In God, as their
original, are the immutable principles of reality and cognizance. In Him things receive at once their existence and their intelligibility. It is by participating in the Divine reason that our own reason
possesses something of the Absolute. Every judgment of reason envelopes a necessary truth, and every necessary truth supposes the necessary Existence.
Thus, from every direction, from metaphysics, aesthetics, an morality above all, we rise to the same
Principle, the common centre, and ultimate foundation of all truth, all beauty, all good. The True, the Beautiful, the Good, are but diverse revelations of one and the same Being. Thus we reach the threshold
of religion and are in communion with the great philosophies which all proclaim a God; and at the same time with the religions which cove the earth, and all repose on the sacred foundation of natural
religion; of that religion which reveals to us the natural light give to all men, without the aid of a particular revelation. So long a philosophy does not arrive at religion, it is below all worships even the
most imperfect; for they at least give man a Father, a Witness, a Consoler, a Judge. By religion, philosophy connects itself with humanity, which, from one end of the world to the other, aspires to God,
believes in God, hopes in God. Philosophy contains in itself the common basis of all religious beliefs; it, as it were, borrows from them their principle, and returns it to them surrounded with light, elevated
above uncertainty, secure against all attack.
From the necessity of His Nature, the Infinite Being must create and preserve the Finite, and to the

Finite must, in its forms, give and communicate of His own kind. We cannot conceive of any finite thing existing without God, the Infinite basis and ground thereof; nor of God existing without
something. God is the necessary logical condition of a world, its necessitating cause; a world, the necessary logical condition of God, His necessitated consequence. It is according to His Infinite
Perfection to create, and then to preserve and bless whatever He creates.
That is the conclusion of modern metaphysical science. The stream of philosophy runs down from Aristotle to Hegel, and breaks off with this conclusion and then again recurs the ancient difficulty. If it
be of His nature to create, if we cannot conceive of His existing alone, without creating, without having created, then what He created was coexistent with Himself. If He could exist an instant without
creating, He could as well do, so for a myriad of eternities. And so again conles round to us the old doctrine of a God, the Soul of the Universe, and coexistent with it.
For what He created had a beginning and however long since that creation occurred, an eternity had
before elapsed. The difference between a beginning and no beginning is infinite.
But of some things we can be certain. We are conscious of ourselves of ourselves if not as substances, at least as Powers to be, to do, to suffer. We are conscious of ourselves not as self originated at all or as
selfsustained alone; but only as dependent, first for existence, ever since for support.
Among the primary ideas of consciousness, that are inseparable from it, the atoms of self consciousness, we find the idea of God. Carefully examined by the scrutizing intellect, it is the idea of
God as infinite, perfectly powerful, wise, just, loving, holy; absolute being with no limitation. This made us, made all, sustains us, sustains all; made our body, not by a single act, but by a series of acts
extending over a vast succession of years, for man's body is the resultant of all created things, made our spirit, our mind, conscience, affections, soul, will, appointed for each its natural mode of action, set
each at its several aim. Thus selfconsciousness leads us to consciousness of God, and at last to consciousness of an infinite God. That is the highest evidence of our own existence, and it is the highest
evidence of His.
If there is a God at all, He must be omnipresent in space. Beyond the last Stars He must be, as He is here. There can be no mote that peoples the sunbeams, no little cell of life that the microscope
discovers in the seedsporule of a moss, but He is there.
He must also be omnipresent in time. There was no second of time before the Stars began to burn, but God was in that second. In the most distant nebulous spot in Orion's belt, and in every one of the
millions that people a square inch of limestone, God is alike present. He is in the smallest imaginable or even unimaginable portion of time and in every second of its most vast and unimaginable volume; His

519/641
Here conterminous with the All of Space, His Now coeval with the All of Time.
Through all this space, in all this Time, His Being extends, spreads undivided, operates unspent; God in all His infinity, perfectly powerful, wise, just, loving, and holy. His being is an infinite activity, a
creating and so a giving of Himself to the World. The World's being is a becoming, a being created and continued. It is so now, and was so, incalculable and unimaginable millions of ages ago.
All this is philosophy, the unavoidable conclusion of the human mind. It is not the opinion of Coleridge
and Kant, but their science; not what they guess, but what they know.
In virtue of this indwelling of God in matter, we say that the world is a revelation of Him, its existence a show of His. He is in His work. The manifold action of the Universe is only His mode of operation,
and all material things are in communion with Him. All grow and move and live in Him, and by means of Him, and only so. Let Him withdraw from the space occupied by anything, and it ceases to be. Let
Him withdraw any quality of His nature from anything, and it ceases to be. All must partake of Him, He dwelling in each, and yet transcending all.
The failure of fanciful religion to become philosophy, does not preclude philosophy from coinciding
with true religion. Philosophy, or rather its object, the divine order of the Universe, is the intellectual guide which the religious sentiment needs; while exploring the real relations of the finite, it obtains a
constantly improving and selfcorrecting measure of the perfect law of the Gospel of Love and Liberty, and a means of carrying into effect the spiritualism of revealed religion. It establishes law, by
ascertaining its terms; it guides the spirit to see its way to the amelioration of life and the increase of happiness. While religion was stationary, science could not walk alone; when both are admitted to be
progressive, their interests and aims become identified. Aristotle began to show how religion may be founded on an intellectual basis; but the basis he laid was too narrow. Bacon, by giving to philosophy a
definite aim and method, gave it at the same time a safer and selfenlarging basis.
Our position is that of intellectual beings surrounded by limitations and the latter being constant, have to intelligence the practical value of laws, in whose investigation and application consists that
seemingly endless career of intellectual and moral progress which the sentiment of religion inspires and ennobles. The title of Saint has commonly been claimed for those whose boast it has been to despise
philosophy; yet faith will stumble and sentiment mislead, unless knowledge be present, in amount and quality sufficient to purify the one and to give beneficial direction to the other.
Science consists of those matured inferences from experice which all other experience confirms. It is no
fixed system perior to revision, but that progressive mediation between ignorance and wisdom in part conceived by Plato, whose immediate object is happiness, and its impulse the highest kind of love.

Science realizes and unites all that was truly valuable in both the old schemes of mediation; the heroic, or system of action and effort and the mystical theory of spiritual, contemplative contemplative
communion. "Listen to me", says Galen "as to the voice of the Eleusinian Hierophant, and believe that the study of nature is a mystery no less important than theirs, nor less adapted to display the wisdom
and power of the Great Creator. Their lessons and demonstrations were obscure, but ours are clear and unmistakable".
To science we owe it that no man is any longer entitled to consider himself the central point around
which the whole Universe of life and motion revolves the immensely important individual or whose convenience and even luxurious ease and indulgence the whole Universe was made. On one side it has
shown us an infinite Universe of stars and suns and worlds at incalculable distances from each other, in whose majestic and awful presence we sink and even our world sinks into insignificance; while, on the
other side, the microscope has placed us in communication with new worlds of organized livings beings, gifted with senses, nerves, appetites, and instincts, in every tear and in every drop of putrid
water.
Thus science teaches us that we are but an infinitesimal portion of a great whole, that stretches out on every side of us, and above and below us, infinite in its complications, and which infinite wisdom alone
can comprehend. Infinite wisdom has arranged the infinite succession of beings, involving the necessity of birth, decay, and death, and made the loftiest virtues possible by providing those conflicts, reverses,
trials, and hardships, without which even their names could never have been invented.
Knowledge is convertible into power and axioms into rules of utility and duty. Modern science is social and communicative. It is moral as well as intellectual; powerful, yet pacific and disinterested; binding
man to man as well as to the Universe; filling up the details of olbligation, and cherishing impulses of virtue, and, by affording clear proof of the consistency and identity of all interests, substituting co
operation for rivalry, liberality for jealousy, and tending far more powerfully than any other means to realize the spirit of religion, by healing those inveterate disorders which, traced to their real origin, will
be found rooted in an ignorant assumption as to the penurious severity of Providence, and the consequent greed of selfish men to confine what seemed as if extorted from it to themselves, or to steal
from each other rather than quietly to enjoy their own.
We shall probably never reach those higher forms containing the true differences of things, involving the full discovery and correct expression of their very self or essence. We shall ever fall short of the
most general and most simple nature, the ultimate or most comprehensive law. Our widest axioms explain many phenomena, but so too in a degree did the principles or elements of the old philosophers,
and the cycles and epicycles of ancient astronomy. We cannot in any case of causation assign the whole of the conditions, nor though we may reproduce them in practice, can we mentally distinguish them all,
without knowing the essences of the things including them; and we therefore must not unconsciously

ascribe that absolute certainty to axioms, which the ancient religionists did to creeds, nor allow the mind, which ever strives to insulate itself and its acquisitions, to forget the nature of the process by
which it substituted scientific for common notions, and so with one as with the other lay the basis of selfdeception by a pedantic and superstitious employment of them.
Doubt, the essential preliminary of all improvement and discovery, must accompany all the stages of
man's onward progress. His intellectual life is a perpetual beginning, a prepetual beginning, a preparation for a birth. The faculty of doubting and questioning, without which those of comparison
and judgment would be useless, is itself a divine prerogative of the reason. Knowledge is always imperfect, or complete only in a prospectively boundless career, in which discovery multiplies doubt
and doubt leads on to new discovery. The boast of science is not so much its manifested results, as its admitted imperfection and capacity of unlimited progress. The true religious philosophy of an imperfect
being is not a system of creed, but, as Socrates thought, an infinite search or approximation. Finality is but another name for bewilderment or defeat. Science gratifies the religious feeling without arresting it
and opens out the unfathomable mystery of the One Supreme into more explicit and manageable Forms, which express not indeed His Essence, which is wholly beyond our reach and higher than our faculties
can climb, but His Will, and so feeds an endless enthusiasm by accumulating forever new objects of pursuit. We have long experienced that knowledge is profitable, we are beginning to find out that it is
moral, and we shall at last discover it to be religious.
God and truth are inseparable; a knowledge of God is possession of the saving oracles of truth. In proportion as the thought and purpose of the individual are trained to conformity with the rule of right
prescribed by supreme Intelligence, so far is his happiness promoted, and the purpose of his existence fulfilled. In this way a new life arises in him; he is no longer isolated, but is a part of the eternal
harmonies around him. His erring will is directed by the influence of a higher will, informing and moulding it in the path of his true happiness.
Man's power of apprehending outward truth is a qualified privilege; the mental like the physical
inspiration passing through a diluted medium and yet, even when truth, imparted, as it were, by intuition, has been specious, or at least imperfect, the intoxication of sudden discovery has ever claimed
it as full, infallible, and divine. And while human weakness needed ever to recur to the pure and perfect source, the revelations once popularly accepted and valued assumed an independent substantiality,
perpetuating not themselves only, but the whole mass of derivitive forms accidentally connected with them, and legalized in their names. The mists of error thickened under the shadows of prescription,
until the free light again broke in upon the night ot ages, redeeming the genuine treasure from the superstition which obstinately doted on its accessories.
Even to the Barbarian, Nature reveals a mighty power and a wondrous wisdom, and continually points

revelation of fear to the savage in Northern climes; he trembles at his deity throned in ice and snow. The lightning, the storm, the earthquake startle the rude man and he sees the divine in the extraordinary.
The grand objects of Nature perpetually constrain men to think of their Author. The Alps are the great
altar of Europe; the nocturnal sky has been to mankind the dome of a temple, starred all over with admonitions to reverence, trust, and love. The Scriptures for the human race are writ in earth and
Heaven. No organ or miserere touches the heart like the sonorous swell of the sea or the oceanwave's immeasurable laugh. Every year the old world puts on new bridal beauty, and celebrates its Whit
Sunday, when in the sweet Spring each bush and tree dons reverently its new glories.
Autumn is a long AllSaints' day and the harvest is Hallowmass to Mankind. Before the human race marched down from the slopes of the Himalayas to take possession of Asia, Chaldea, and Egypt, men
marked each annual crisis, the solstices and the equinoxes, and celebrated religious
festivals therein; even then, and ever since, the material was and has been the element of communion
between man and God.
Nature is full of religious lessons to a thoughtful man. He dissolves the matter of the Universe, leaving only its forces; he solves away the phenomena of human history, leaving only immortal spirit; he
studies the law, the mode of action of the forces and this spirit, which make up the material and the human world, and cannot fail to be filled with reverence, with trust, with boundless love of the Infinite
God, who devised these laws of matter and of mind, and thereby bears up this marvellous Universe of things and men. Science has its New Testament and beatitudes of Philosophy are profoundly touching.
An undevour astronomer is mad.
Familiarity with the grass and the trees teaches us deeper lessons of love and trust than we can glean from the writings of Fenelon and Augustine. The great Bible of God is ever open before mankind. The
eternal flowers of Heaven seem to shed sweet influence on the perishable blossoms of the earth. The great sermon of Jesus was preached on a mountain, which preached to Him as He did to the people, and
His figures of speech were first natural figures of fact.
If tomorrow I am to perish utterly, then I shall only take counsel for today, and ask for qualities which last no longer. My fathers will be to me only as the ground out of which my breadcorn is grown; dead
they are but the rotten mould of earth, their memory of small concern to me. Posterity! I shall care nothing for the future generations of mankind! I am one atom in the trunk of a tree, and care nothing for
the roots below, or the branch above. I shall sow such seed only as will bear harvest today. Passion may enact my statutes today, and ambition repeal them tomorrow. I will know no other legislators. Morality
will vanish, and expediency take its place. Heroism will be gone and instead of it there will be the savage ferocity of the hewolf, the brute cunning of the shefox, the rapacity of the vulture, and the

headlong daring of the wild bull; but no longer the cool, calm courage that, for truth's sake, and for love's sake, looks death firmly in the face, and then wheels into line ready to be slain. Affection,
friendship, philanthropy, will be but the wild fancies of the monomaniac, fit subjects for smiles or laughter or for pity.
But knowing that we shall live forever, and that the Infinite God loves all of us, we can look on all the
evils of the world, and see that it is only the hour before sunrise, and that the light is coming; and so we also, even we, may light a little taper, to illuminate the darkness while it lasts, and help until the day
spring come. Eternal morning follows the night; a rainbow scarfs the shoulders of every cloud that weeps its rain away to be flowers on land and pearls at sea. Life rises out of the grave, the soul cannot
be held by fettering flesh. No dawn is hopeless and disaster is only the threshold of delight.
Beautifully, above the great wide chaos of human errors, shines the calm, clear light of natural human religion, revealing to us God as the Infinite Parent of all, perfectly powerful, wise, just, loving, and
perfectly holy too. Beautiful around stretches off every way the Universe, the Great Bible of God. Material nature is its Old Testament, millions of years old, thick with eternal truths under our feet,
glittering with everlasting glories over our heads and Human Nature is the New Testament from the Infinite God, every day revealing a new page as Time turns over the leaves. Immortality stands waiting
to give a recompense for every virtue not rewarded, for every tear not wiped away, for every sorrow undeserved, for every prayer, for every pure intention and emotion of the heart. And over the whole,
over Nature, Material and Human, over this Mortal Life and over the eternal Past and Future, the infinite Lovingkindness of God the Father comes enfolding all and blessing everything that ever was,
that is, that ever shall be.
Everything is a thought of the Infinite God. Nature is His prose, and man His Poetry. There is no Chance, no Fate; but God's Great Providence, enfolding the whole Universe in its bosom, and feeding it
with everlasting life. In times past there has been evil which we cannot understand; now there are evils which we cannot solve, nor make square with God's perfect goodness by any theory our feeble intellect
enables us to frame. There are sufferings, follies, and sins for all mankind, for every nation, for every man and every woman. They were all foreseen by the infinite wisdom of God, all provided for by His
infinite power and justice, and all are consistent with His infinite love. To believe otherwise would be to believe that He made the world, to amuse His idle hours with the follies and agonies of mankind, as
Domitian was wont to do with the wrigglings and contortions of insect agonies. Then indeed we might despairingly unite in that horrible utterance of Heine: "Alas, God's Satire weighs heavily on me! The
Great Author of the Universe, the Aristophanes of Heaven, is bent on demonstrating, with crushing force, to me, the little, earthly, German Aristophanes, how my wittiest sarcasms are only pitiful
attempts at jesting, in comparison with His, and how miserably I am beneath Him, in humor, in colossal mockery".

No, no! God is not thus amused with and prodigal of human suffering. The world is neither a Here without a Hereafter, a body without a soul, a chaos with no God; nor a body blasted by a soul, a Here
with a worse Hereafter, a world with a God that hates more than half the creatures He has made. There is no Savage, Revengeful, and Evil God; but there is an Infinite God, seen everywhere as Perfect Cause,
everywhere as Perfect Providence, transcending all, yet indwelling everywhere, with perfect power, wisdom, justice, holiness, and love, providing for the future welfare of each and all, foreseeing and
forecaring for every bubble that breaks on the great stream of human life and human history.
The end of man and the object of existence in this world, being not only happiness, but happiness in virtue and through virtue, virtue in this world is the condition of happiness in another life, and the
condition of virtue in this world is suffering, more or less frequent, briefer or longer continued, more or less intense. Take away suffering and there is no longer any resignation or humanity, no more self
sacrifice, no more devotedness, no more heroic virtues, no more sublime morality. We are subjected to suffering, both because we are sensible, and because we ought to be virtuous. If there were no physical
evil, there would be no possible virtue, and the world would be badly adapted to the destiny of man. The apparent disorders of the physical world, and the evils that result from them, are not disorders and
evils that occur despite the power and goodness of God. God not only allows, but wills them. It is His will that there shall be in the physical world causes enough of pain for man, to afford him occasions for
resignation and courage.
Whatever is favorable to virtue, whatever gives the moral liberty more energy, whatever can serve the greater moral development of the human race, is good. Suffering is not the worst condition of man on
earth. The worst condition is the moral brutalization which the absence of physical evil would engender.
External or internal physical evil connects itself with the object of existence, which is to accomplish the
moral law here below, whatever the consequences, with the firm hope that virtue unfortunate will not fail to be rewarded in another life. The moral law has its sanction and its reason in itself. It owes
nothing to that law of merit and demerit that accompanies it, but is not its basis. But, though the principle of merit and demerit ought not to be the determining principle of virtuous action, it
powerfully concurs with the moral law, because it offers virtue a legitimate ground of consolation and hope.
Morality is the recognition of duty, as duty, and its accomplishment, whatever the consequences.
Religion is the recognition of duty in its necessary harmony with goodness; a harmony that must have
its realization in another life, through the justice and omnipotence of God.

Religion is as true as morality; for once morality is admitted, its consequences must be admitted.
The whole moral existence is included in these two words, harmonious with each other: DUTY and HOPE.
Masonry teaches that God is infinitely good. What motive, what reason and morally speaking, what
possibility can there be to Infinite Power and Infinite Wisdom, to be anything but good? Our very sorrows, proclaiming the loss of objects inexpressibly dear to us, demonstrate His Goodness. The Being
that made us intelligent cannot Himself be without intelligence; and He Who has made us so to love and to sorrow for what we love, must number love for the creatures He has made, among His infinite
attributes.
Amid all our sorrows, we take refuge in the assurance that He loves us; that He does not capriciously, or through indifference and still less in mere anger, grieve and afflict us; that He chastens us, in order that
by His chastisements, which are by His universal law only the consequences of our acts, we may be profited and that He could not show so much love for His creatures, by leaving them unchastened,
untried, undisciplined. We have faith in the Infinite; faith in God's Infinite Love and it is that faith that must save us.
No dispensations of God's Providence, no suffering or bereavement is a messenger of wrath: none of its
circumstances are indications of God's Anger. He is incapable of Anger; higher above any such feelings than the distant stars are above the earth. Bad men do not die because God hates them. They die
because it is best for them that they should do so and bad as they are, it is better for them to be in the hands of the infinitely good God, than anywhere else.
Darkness and gloom lie upon the paths of men. They stumble at difficulties, are ensnared by
temptations and perplexed by trouble. They are anxious and troubled, and fearful. Pain and affliction and sorrow often gather around the steps of their earthly pilgrimage. All this is written indelibly upon
the tablets of the human heart. It is not to be erased; but Masonry sees and reads it in a new light. It does not expect these ills and trials and sufferings to be removed from life; but that the great truth will
at some time be believed by all men, that they are the means selected by infinite wisdom, to purify the heart and to invigorate the soul whose inheritance is immortality, and the world its school.
Masonry propagates no creed except its own most simple and Sublime One; that universal religion,
taught by Nature and by Reason. Its Lodges are neither Jewish, Moslem, nor Christian Temples. It reiterates the precepts of morality of all religions. It venerates the character and commends the
teachings of the great and good of all ages and of all countries. It extracts the good and not the evil, the truth, and not the error, from all creeds and acknowledges that there is much which is good and true in

all.
Above all the other great teachers of morality and virtue, it reveres the character of the Great Master Who, submissive to the will of His and our Father, died upon the Cross. All must admit, that if the
world were filled with beings like Him, the great ills of society would be at once relieved. For all coercion, injury, selfishness, and revenge, and all the wrongs and the greatest sufferings of life, would
disappear at once. These human years would be happy; and the eternal ages would roll on in brightness and beauty and the still, sad music of Humanity, that sounds through the world, now in the accents of
grief, and now in pensive melancholy, would change to anthems, sounding to the March of Time, and bursting out from the heart of the world.
If every man were a perfect imitator of that Great, wise, Good Teacher, clothed with all His faith and all
His virtues, how the circle of Life's ills and trials would be narrowed! The sensual passions would assail the heart in vain. Want would no longer successfully tempt men to act wrongly, nor curiosity to do
rashly. Ambition, spreading before men its Kingdoms and its Thrones, and offices and honors, would cause none to swerve from their great allegiance. Injury and insult would be shamed by forgiveness
"Father," men would say, "forgive them; for they know not what they do".
None would seek to be enriched at another's loss or expense. Every man would feel that the whole human race were his brothers. All sorrow and pain and anguish would be soothed by a perfect faith and
an entire trust in the Infinite Goodness of God. The world around us would be new and the Heavens above us; for here, and there and everywhere, through all the ample glories and splendors of the
Universe, all men would recognize and feel the presence and the beneficent care of a loving Father.
However, the Mason may believe as to creeds, and churches and miracles and missions from Heaven, he must admit that the Life and character of Him who taught in Galilee, and fragments of Whose teachings
have come down to us, are worthy of all imitation. That Life is an undenied and undeniable Gospel. Its teachings cannot be passed by and discarded. All must admit that it would be happiness to follow and
perfection to imitate Him. None ever felt for Him a sincere emotion of contempt, nor in anger accused Him of sophistry, nor saw immorality lurking in His doctrines; however they may judge of those who
succeeded Him and claimed to be His apostles. Divine or human, inspired or only a reforming Essene, it must be agreed that His teachings are far nobler, far purer, far less alloyed with error and
imperfection, far less of the earth earthly, than those of Socrates, Plato, Seneca, or Mahomet or any other of the great moralists and Reformers of the world.
If our aims went as completely as His beyond personal care and selfish gratification; if our thoughts and
words and actions were as entirely employed upon the great work of benefiting our kind the true work which we have been placed here to do as His were; if our nature were as gentle and as tender as His;

and if society, country, kindred, friendship and home were as dear to us as they were to Him, we should be at once relieved of more than half the difficulties and the diseased and painful affections of our lives.
Simple obedience to rectitude, instead of selfinterest; simple selfculture and selfimprovement, instead of constant cultivation of the good opinion of others; singlehearted aims and purposes, instead of
improper objects, sought and approached by devious and crooked ways, would free our meditations of many disturbing and irritating questions.
Not to renounce the nobler and better affections of our natures, nor happiness, nor our just dues of love
and honor from men; not to vilify ourselves, nor to renounce our selfrespect, nor a just and reasonable sense of our merits and deserts, nor our own righteousness of virtue, does Masonry require, nor would
our imitation of Him require; but to renounce our vices, our faults, our passions, our selfflattering delusions; to forego all outward advantages, which are to be gained only through a sacrifice of our
inward integrity, or by anxious and petty contrivances and appliances; to choose and keep the better part; to secure that and let the worst take care of itself; to keep a good conscience and let opinion come
and go as it will; to retain a lofty selfrespect, and let low selfindulgence go; to keep inward happiness and let outward advantages hold a subordinate place; to renoune our selfishness, and that eternal
anxiety as to what we are to have, and what men think of us and be content with the plenitude of God's great mercies, and so to be happy.
For it is the inordinate devotion to self and consideration of self, that is ever a a stumbling block in the
way; that spreads questions, snares, and difficulties around us, darkens the way of Providence, and makes the world a far less happy one to us than it might be.
As He taught, so Masonry teaches, affection to our kindred, tenderness to our friends, gentleness and
forbearance toward our inferiors, pity for the suffering, forgiveness of our enemies; and to wear an affectionate nature and gentle disposition as the garment of our life, investing pain and toil, and agony,
and even death, with a serene and holy beauty. It does not teach us to wrap ourselves in the garments of reserve and pride, to care nothing for the world because it cares nothing for us, to withdraw our
thoughts from society because it does us not justice, and see how patiently we can live within the confines of our own bosoms, or in quiet communion, through books, with the mighty dead. No man
ever found peace or light in that way. Every relation, of hate, scorn, or neglect, to mankind, is full of vexation and torment. There is nothing to do with men but to love them, to admire their virtues, pity
and bear with their faults and forgive their injuries. To hate your adversary will not help you; to kill him will help you still less; nothing within the compass of the Universe will help you, but to pity, forgive
and love him.
If we possessed His gentle and affectionate disposition, His love and compassion for all that err and all that offend, how many difficulties, both within and without us, would they relieve! How many
depressed minds should we console! How many troubles in society should we compose! How many

enmities soften! How many a knot of mystery and misunderstanding would be untied by a single word, spoken in simple and confiding truth! How many a rough path would be made smooth, and how many a
crooked path be made straight! Very many places, now solitary, would be made glad; very many dark places be filled with light.
Morality has its axioms, like the other sciences and these axioms are, in all languages, justly termed
moral truths. Moral truths, considered in themselves, are equally as certain as mathematical truths. Given the idea of a deposit, the idea of keeping it faithfully is attached to it as necessarily, as to the idea
of a triangle is attached the idea that its three angles are equal to two right angles. You may violate a deposit; but in doing so, do not imagine that you change the nature of things, or make what is in itself a
deposit become your own property. The two ideas exclude each other. You have but a false semblance of property and all the efforts of the passions, all the sophisms of interest, will not overturn essential
differences. Therefore it is that a moral truth is so imperious; because, like all truth, it is what it is and shapes itself to please no caprice. Always the same, and always present, little as we may like it, it
inexorably condemns, with a voice always heard, but not always regarded, the insensate and guilty will which thinks to prevent its existing, by denying, or rather by pretending to deny, its existence.
The moral truths are distinguished from other truths by this singular characteristic so soon as we
perceive them, they appear to us as the rule of our conduct. If it is true that a deposit is made in order to be returned to its legitimate possessor, it must be returned. To the necessity of believing the truth, the
necessity practising it is added.
The necessity of practising the moral truths is obligation. The moral truths, necessary to the eye of reason, are obligatory on the will. The moral obligation, like the moral truth which is its basis, is
absolute. As necessary truths are not more or less necessary, so obligation is not more or less obligatory. There are degrees of importance among different obligations; but there are no degrees in the
obligation itself. One is not nearly obliged, almost obliged; but wholly so, or not at all. If there be any place of refuge against the obligation, it ceases to exist.
If the obligation is absolute, it is immutable and universal. For if what is obligation today may not be
so tomorrow, if what is obligatory for me may not be so for you, the obligation differing from itself, it would be relative and contingent. This fact of absolute, immutable, universal obligation is certain and
manifest. The good is the foundation of obligation. If it be not, obligation has no foundation; and that is impossible. If one act ought to be done, and another ought not, it must be because evidently there is an
essential difference between the two acts. If one be not good and the other bad, the obligation imposed on us is arbitrary.
To make the Good a consequence, of anything whatever, is to annihilate it. It is the first, or it is nothing.

When we ask an honest man why, despite his urgent necessities, he has respected the sanctity of a deposit, he answers, because it was his duty. Asked why it was his duty, he answers, because it was
right, was just, was good. Beyond that there is no answer to be made, but there is also no question to be asked. No one permits a duty to be imposed on him without giving himself a reason for it. But when it
is admitted that the duty is commanded by justice, the mind is satisfied; for it has arrived at a principle beyond which there is nothing to seek, justice being its own principle. The primary truths include their
own reason: and justice, the essential distinction between good and evil, is the first truth of morality.
Justice is not a consequence; because we cannot ascend to any principle above it. Moral truth forces itself on man, and does not emanate from him. It no more becomes subjective, by appearing to us
obligatory, than truth does by appearing to us necessary. It is in the very nature of the true and the good that we must seek for the reason of necessity and obligation.
Obligation is founded on the necessary distinction between the good and the evil; and it is itself the
foundation of liberty. If man has his duties to perform, he must have the faculty of accomplishing them, of resisting desire, passion, and interest, in order to obey the law. He must be free; therefore he is so, or
human nature is in contradiction with itself. The certainty of the obligation involves the corresponding certainty of free will.
It is the will that is free; though sometimes that will may be ineffectual. The power to do must not be
confounded with the power to will. The former may be limited; the latter is sovereign. The external effects may be prevented: the resolution itself cannot. Of this sovereign power of the will we are
conscious. We feel in ourselves, before it becomes determinate, the force which can determine itself in one way or another. At the same time when I will this or that, I am equally conscious that I can will the
contrary. I am conscious that I am the master of my resolution: that I may check it, continue it, retake it. When the act has ceased, the consciousness of the power which produced it has not. That consciousness
and the power remain, superior to all the manifestations of the power. Wherefore freewill is the essential and eversubsisting attribute of the will itself.
At the same time that we judge that a free agent has done a good or a bad act, we form another
judgment, as necessary as the first; that if he has done well, he deserves compensation; if ill, punishment. That judgment may be expressed in a manner more or less vivid, according as it is mingled
with sentiments more or less ardent. Sometimes it will be a merely kind feeling toward a virtuous agent and moderately hostile to a guilty one; sometimes enthusiasm or indignation. The judgment of merit
and demerit is intimately connected with the judgment of good and evil. Merit is the natural right which we have to be rewarded; demerit the natural right which others have to punish us. But whether
the reward is received or the punishment undergone, or not, the merit or demerit equally subsists.

Punishment and reward are the satisfaction of merit and demerit, but do not constitute them. Take away the former, and the latter continue. Take away the latter, and there are no longer real rewards or
punishments. When a base man encompasses our merited honors, he has obtained the mere appearance of a reward; a mere material advantage. The reward is essentially moral; and its value is independent of
its form. One of those simple crowns of oak with which the early Romans rewarded heroism, was of more real value than the wealth of the world, when it was the sign of the gratitude and admiration of a
people. Reward accorded to merit is a debt; without merit it is an alms or a theft.
The Good is good in itself and to be accomplished, whatever the consequences. The results of the Good cannot but be fortunate. Happiness, separated from the Good, is but a fact to which no moral idea is
attached. As an effect of the Good, it enters into the moral order, completes and crowns it.
Virtue without happiness and crime without misery, is a contradiction and disorder. If virtue suppose sacrifice (that is, suffering), eternal justice requires that sacrifice generously accepted and courageously
borne, shall have for its reward the same happiness that was sacrificed and it also requires that crime shall be punished with unhappiness, for the guilty happiness which it attempted to procure.
This law that attaches pleasure and sorrow to the good and the evil is, in general, accomplished even
here below. For order rules in the world; because the world lasts. Is that order sometimes disturbed? Are happiness and sorrow not always distributed in legitimate proportion to crime and virtue? The absolute
judgment of the Good, the absolute judgment of obligation, the absolute judgment of merit and demerit, continue to subsist, inviolable and imprescriptible and we cannot help but believe that He Who
has implanted in us the sentiment and idea of order, cannot therein Himself be wanting and that He will, sooner or later, reestablish the holy harmony of virtue and happiness, by means belonging to
Himself.
The Judgment of the Good, the decision that such a thing is good and that such another is not, this is the primitive fact, and reposes on itself. By its intimate resemblances to the judgment of the true and
the beautiful, it shows us the secret affinities of morality, metaphysics and aesthetics. The good, so especilly united to the true, is distinguished from it, only because it is truth put in practice. The good is
obligatory. These are two indivisible but not identical ideas. The idea of obligation reposes on the idea of the Good. In this intimate alliance, the former borrows from the latter its universal and absolute
character.
The obligatory good is the moral law. That is the foundation of all morality. By it we separate ourselves from the morality of interest and the morality of sentiment. We admit the existence of those facts and
their influence; but we do not assign them the same rank.

531/641
To the moral law, in the reason of man, corresponds liberty in action. Liberty is deduced from obligation, and is a fact irresistibly evident. Man, as free, and subject to obligation, is a moral person
and that involves the idea of rights. To these ideas is added that of merit and demerit; which supposes the distinction between good and evil, obligation and liberty and creates the idea of reward and
punishment.
The sentiments play no unimportant part in morality. All the moral judgments are accompanied by sentiments that respond to them. From the secret sources of enthusiasm the human will draws the
mysterious virtue that makes heroes. Truth enlightens and illumines. Sentiment warms and inclines to action. Interest also bears its part and the hope of happiness is the work of God, and one of the motive
powers of human action.
Such is the admirable economy of the moral constitution of man. His Supreme Object, the Good; his law, virtue, which often imposes upon him suffering, thus making him to excel all other created beings
known to us. But this law is harsh, and in contradiction with the instinctive desire for happiness. Wherefore the Beneficent Author of his being has placed in his soul, by the side of the severe law of
duty, the sweet, delightful force of sentiment. Generally he attaches happiness to virtue; and for the exceptions, for such there are, he has placed Hope at the end of the journey to be travelled.
Thus there is a side on which morality touches religion. It is a sublime necessity of Humanity to see in
God the Legislator suremely wise, the witness always present, the infallible Judge of virtue. The human mind, ever climbing up to God, would deem the foundations of morality too unstable, if it did not place
in God the first principle of the moral law.
Wishing to give to the moral law a religious character, we run the risk of taking from it its moral character. We may refer it so entirely to God as to make His will an arbitrary degree. But the will of
God, whence we deduce morality, in order to give it authority, itself has no moral authority, exccpt as it is just. The Good comes from the will of God alone; but from His will, in so far as it is the expression
of His wisdom and justice. The Eternal Justice of God is the sole foundation of Justice, such as Humanity perceives and practises it. The Good, duty, merit and demerit, are referred to God, as
everything is referred to Him; but they have none the less a proper evidence and authority. Religion is the crown of Morality, not its base. The base of Morality is in itself.
The Moral Code of Masonry is still more extensive than that developed by philosophy. To the
requisitions of the law of Nature and the law of God, it adds the imperative obligation of a contract. Upon entering the Order, the Initiate binds to himself every Mason in the world. Once enrolled among
the children of light, every Mason on earth becomes his brother and owes him the duties, the kindnesses, and the sympathies of a brother. On every one he may call for assistance in need, protection

against danger, sympathy in sorrow, attention in sickness, and decent burial after death.
There is not a Mason in the world who is not bound to go to his relief, when he is in danger, if there be greater probability of saving his life than of losing his own. No Mason can wrong him to the value of
anything, knowingly, himself, nor suffer it to be done by others, if it be in his power to prevent it. No Mason can speak evil of him, to his face or behind his back. Every Mason must keep his lawful secrets,
and aid him in his business, defend his character when unjustly assailed, and protect, counsel, and assist his widow and his orphans. What so many thousands owe to him, he owes to each of them. He has
solemnly bound himself to be ever ready to discharge this sacred debt. If he fails to do it he is dishonest and forsworn; and it is an unparalleled meanness in him to obtain good offices by false pretences, to
receive kindness and service, rendered him under the confident expectation that he will in his turn render the same, and then to disappoint, without ample reason, that just expectation.
Masonry holds him also, by his solemn promise, to a purer life a nobler generosity, a more perfect
charity of opinion and action. To be tolerant, catholic in his love for his race, ardent in his zeal for the interest of mankind, the advancement and progress of humanity.
Such are, we think, the Philosophy and the Morality, such the TRUE WORD of a Master Mason.
The world, the ancients believed, was governed by Seven Secondary Causes; and these were the
universal forces, known to the Hebrews by the plural name ELOHIM. These forces, analogous and contrary one to the other, produce equilibrium by their contrasts, and regulate the movements of the
spheres. The Hebrews called them the Seven great Archangels and gave them names, each of which, being a combination of another word with AL, the first Phoenician NatureGod, considered as the
Principle of Light, represented them as His manifestations. Other peoples assigned to these Spirits the government of the Seven Planets then known, and gave them the names of their great divinities.
So, in the Kabala, the last Seven Sephiroth constituted ATIK YOMIN, the Ancient of Days; and these,
as well as the Seven planets, correspond with the Seven colors separated by the prism, and the Seven notes of the musical octave.
Seven is the sacred number in all theogonies and all symbols, because it is composed of 3 and 4. It
represents the magical power in its full force. It is the Spirit assisted by all the Elementary Powers, the Soul served by Nature, the Holy Empire spoken of in the clavicules of Solomon, symbolized by a
warrior, crowned, bearing a triangle on his cuirass, and standing on a cube, to which are harnessed two Sphinxes, one white and the other black, pulling contrary ways, and turning the head to look backward.

The vices are Seven, like the virtues and the latter were anciently symbolized by the Seven Celestial bodies then known as planets. FAITH, as the converse of arrogant Confidence, was represented by the
Sun; HOPE, enemy of Avarice, by the Moon; CHARITY, opposed to Luxury, by Venus; FORCE, stronger than Rage, by Mars; PRUDENCE, the opposite of Indolence, by Mercury; TEMPERANCE,
the antipodes of Gluttony, by Saturn; and JUSTICE, the opposite of Envy, by Jupiter.
The Kabalistic book of the Apocalypse is represented as closed with Seven Seals. In it we find the Seven genii of the Ancient Mythologies and the doctrine concealed under its emblems is the pure
Kabala, already lost by the Pharisees at the advent of the Saviour. The pictures that follow in this wondrous epic are so many pantacles, of which the numbers 3, 4, 7 and 12 are keys.
The Cherub, or symbolic bull, which Moses places at the gate of the Edenic world, holding a blazing
sword, is a Sphinx, with the body of a bull and a human head; the old Assyrian Sphinx whereof the combat and victory of Mithras were the hieroglyph analysis. This armed Sphinx represents the law of
the Mystery, which keeps watch at the door of initiation, to repulse the Profane. It also represents the grand Magical Mystery, all the elements whereof the number 7 expresses, still without giving it last
word. This "unspeakable word" of the Sages of the school of Alexandria, this word, which the Hebrew Kabalists wrote; IHUH and translated by ARARITA, so expressing the threefoldness of the Secondary
Principle, the dualism of the middle ones, and the Unity as well of the first Principle as of the end and also the junction of the number 3 with the number 4 in a word composed of four letters, but formed of
seven by one triplicate and two repeated, this word is pronounced Ararita.
The vowels in the Greek language are also Seven in number and were used to designate the Seven planets.
Tsadok or Sydyc was the Supreme God in Phoenicia. His Seven Sons were probably the Seven Cabiri;
and he was the Heptaktis, the God of Seven Rays.
Kronos, the Greek saturn, Philo makes Sanchoniathon say, had six sons, and by Astarte Seven daughters, the Titanides. The Persians adored Ahura Masda or Ormuzd and the Six Amshaspands the
first three of whom were Lords of the Empires of Light, Fire and Splendor; the Babylonians, Bal and the Gods; the Chinese Shangti and the Six Chief Spirits and the Greeks, Kronos and the Six great Male
Gods, his progeny, Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Ares, Hephaistos and Hermes; while the female deities were also Seven: Rhea, wife of Kronos, Here, Athene, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hestia and Demetei. In the
Orphic Theogony, Gaia produced the fourteen Titans, Seven male and Seven female, Kronos being the most potent of the males and as the number Seven appears in these, nine by threes or the triple triangle,
is found in the three Moerae or Fates, the three Centimanes, and the three Cyclopes, offspring of Ouranos and Gaia, or Heaven and Earth.

The metals, like the colors, were deemed to be Seven in number, and a metal and color were assigned to
each planet. Of the metals, gold was assigned to the Sun and silver to the Moon.
The palace of Deioces in Ecbatana had Seven circular walls of different colors, the two innermost having their battlements covered respectively with silvering and gilding.
And the Seven Spheres of Borsippa were represented by the Stories, each of a different color, of the
tower or truncated pyramid of Bel at Babylon.
Pharaoh saw in his dream, which Joseph interpreted, Seven ears of wheat on one stalk, full and good, and after them Seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the East Wind; and the Seven thin ears
devoured the Seven good ears; and Joseph interpreted these to mean Seven years of plenty succeeded by Seven years of famine.
Connected with this Ebn Hesham relates that a flood of rain laid bare to view a sepulchre in Yemen, in
which lay a woman having on her neck Seven collars of pearls, and on her hands and feet bracelets and anklerings and armlets, Seven on each, with an inscription on a tablet showing that, after attempting in
vain to purchase grain of Joseph, she, Tajah, daughter of Dzu Shefar, and her people, died of famine.
Hear again the words of an adept, who had profoundly studied the mysteries of science, and wrote, as the Ancient Oracles spoke, in enigmas; but who knew that the theory of mechanical forces and of the
materiality of the most potent agents of Divinity, explains nothing, and ought to satisfy no one!
Through the veil of all the hieratic and mystic allegories of the ancient dogmas, under the seal of all the sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the worn stones of the ancient temples, and on
the blackened face of the sphinx of Assyria or Egypt, in the monstrous or marvellous pictures which the sacred pages of the Vedas translate for the believers of India, in the strange emblems of our old books
of alchemy, in the ceremonies of reception practised by all the mysterious Societies, we find the traces of a doctrine, everywhere the same, and everywhere carefully concealed. The occult philosophy seems
to have been the nurse or the godmother of all religions, the secret lever of all the intellectual forces, the key of all divine obscurities, and the absolute Queen of Society, in the ages when it was exclusively
reserved for the education of the Priests and Kings.

incredible luxury of poetry, grace, and terror in its emblems; it had civilized Greece by the sounds of the lyre of Orpheus; it hid the principles of all the sciences, and of the whole progression of the human
spirit, in the audacious calculations of Pythagoras: fable teemed with its miracles and history, when it undertook to judge of this unknown power, confounded itself with fable; it shook or enfeebled empires
by its oracles; made tyrants turn pale on their thrones and ruled over all minds by means of curiosity or fear. To this science, said the crowd, nothing is impossible. It commands the elements, knows the
language of the planets and controls the movements of the stars. The moon, as its voice falls, reeking with blood, from Heaven; the dead rise upright on their graves and shape into fatal words the wind that
breathes through their skulls. Controller of Love or Hate, this science can at pleasure confer on human hearts Paradise or Hell. It disposes at will of all forms and distributes beauty or deformity as it pleases;
it changes in turn, with the rod of Circe, men into brutes and animals into men. It even disposes of Life or of Death and can bestow on its adepts riches by the transmutation of metals and immortality by its
quintessence and elixir, compounded of gold and light.
This is what magic had been, from Zoroaster to Manes, from Orpheus to Apollonius Thyaneus; when positive Christianity, triumphing over the splendid dreams and gigantic aspirations of the school of
Alexandria, publicly crushed this philosophy with its anathemas and compelled it to become more occult and more mysterious than ever.
At the bottom of magic, nevertheless, was science as at the bottom of Christianity there was love; and in
the Evangelic Symbols we see the incarnate WORD adored in its infancy by three magi whom a star guides (the ternary and the sign of the microcosm), and receiving from them gold, frankincense, and
myrrh; another mysterious ternary, under the emblem whereof are allegorically contained the highest secrets of the Kabala.
Christianity should not have hated Magic; but human ignorance always fears the unknown. Science was
obliged to conceal itself, to avoid the impassioned aggressions of a blind love. It enveloped itself in new hieroglyphs, concealed its efforts, disguised its hopes. Then was created the jargon of alchemy, a
continual deception for the vulgar herd, greedy of gold and a living language for the true disciples of Hermes alone.
Resorting to Masonry, the alchemists there invented Degrees and partly unveiled their doctrine to their
Initiates; not by the language of their receptions, but by oral instruction afterward; for their rituals, to one who has not the key, are but inconprehensible and absurd jargon.
Among the sacred books of the Christians are two works which the infallible church does not pretend to

seals for all faithful believers and perfectly clear to the unbeliever initiated in the occult sciences.
For Christians and in their opinion, the scientific and magical clavicules of Solomon are lost. Nevertheless, it is certain that, in the domain of intelligence governed by the WORD, nothing that is
written is lost. Only those things which men cease to understand no longer exist for them, at least as WORD; then they enter into the domain of enigmas and mystery.
The mysterious founder of the Christian Church was saluted in His cradle by the three Magi, that is to
say by the hieratic ambassadors from the three parts of the known world, and from the three analogical worlds of the occult philosophy.
In the school of Alexandria, Magic and Christianity almost take each other by the hand under the
auspices of Ammonius Saccos and Plato. The dogma of Hermes is found almost entire in the writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite. Synesius traces the plan of a treatise on dreams, which was
subsequently to be commented on by Cardan, and composes hymns which might serve for the liturgy of the Church of Swedenborg, if a church of illuminati could have a liturgy.
To this epoch of ardent abstractions and impassioned logomachies belongs the philosophical reign of
Julian, an illuminatus and Initiate of the first order, who believed in the unity of God and the universal Dogma of the Trinity, and regretted the loss of nothing of the old world but its magnificent symbols and
too graceful images. He was no Pagan, but a Gnostic, infected with the allegories of Grecian polytheism, and whose misfortune it was to find the name of Jesus Christ less sonorous than that of
Orpheus.
We may be sure that so soon as Religion and Philosophy become distinct departments, the mental activity of the age is in advance of its Faith; and that, though habit may sustain the latter for a time, its
vitality is gone.
The dunces who led primitive Christianity astray, by substituting faith for science, reverie for experience, the fantastic for the reality and the inquisitors who for so many ages waged agains Magism
a war of extermination, have succeeded in shrouding in darkness the ancient discoveries of the human mind; so that we now grope in the dark to find again the key of the phenomena of nature. But all natural
phenomena depend on a single al immutable law, represented by the philosophal stone and its symbolic form, which is that of a cube. This law, expressed in the Kabala by the number 4, furnished the
Hebrews with all the mysteries of their divine Tetragram.

Bohemians, the Taro of the Kabalists. It supplies to the Adept the last word of the human Sciences and the Key of the Divine Power: but he alone understands how to avail himself of it who comprehends the
necessity of never revealing it. If Oedipus, in place of slaying the Sphynx, had conquered it, and driven it into Thebes harnessed to his chariot, he would have been King, without incest, calamities, or exile. If
Psyche, by submission and caresses, had persuaded Love to reveal himself, she would never have lost him. Love is one of the mythological images of the grand secret and the grand agent, because it
expresses at once an action and a passion, a void and plenitude, an arrow and a wound. The Initiates ought to understand this, and, lest the profane should overhear, Masonry never says too much.
When Science had been overcome in Alexandria by the fanaticism of the murderers of Hypatia, it
became Christian, or, rather it concealed itself under Christian disguises, with Ammonius Synosius, and the author of the books of Dionysius the Areopagite. Then it was necessary to win the pardon of
miracles by the appearances of superstition and of science by a language unintelligible. Hieroglyphic writing was revived, and pantacles and characters were invented, that summed up a whole doctrine in a
sign, a whole series of tendencies and revelations in a word. What as the object of the aspirants to knowledge? They sought for the secret of the great work, or the Philosophal Stone, or the perpetual
motion, or the squaring of the circle, or the universal medicine; formulas which often saved them from persecution and general illwill, by exposing them to the charge of folly; and each of which expressed
one of the forces of the grand magical secret. This lasted until the time of the Roman de la Rose, which also expresses the mysterious and magical meaning of the poem of Dante, borrowed from the High
Kabalah, that immense and conealed source of the universal philosophy.
It is not strange that man knows but little of the powers of the human will, and imperfectly appreciates them; since he knows nothing as to the nature of the will and its mode of operation. That his own will
can move his arm, or compel another to obey him; that his thoughts, symbolically expressed by the signs of writing, can influence and lead other men, are mysteries as incomrehensible to him, as that the
will of Deity could effect the creaion of a Universe.
The powers of the will are as yet chiefly indefinite and unknown. Whether a multitude of well established phenomena are to be ascribed to the power of the will alone, or to magnetism or some other
natural agent, is a point as yet unsettled; but it is agreed by all that a concentrated effort of the will is in every case necessary to success.
That the phenomena are real is not to be doubted, unless credit is no longer to be given to human
testimony and if they are real, there is no reason for doubting the exercise heretofore, by many adepts, of the powers that were then termed magical. Nothing is better vouched for than the extraordinary
performances of the Brahmins. No religion is supported by stronger testimony; nor as any one ever even attempted to explain what may well be termed their miracles.

How far, in this life, the mind and soul can act without and independently of the body, no one as yet knows. That the will can act at all without bodily contact, and the phenomena of dreams, are mysteries
that confound the wisest and most learned, whose explanations are but a Babel of words.
Man as yet knows little of the forces of nature. Surrounded, controlled, and governed by them, while he vainly thinks himself independent, not only of his race, but the universal nature and her infinite
manifold forces, he is the slave of these forces, unless he becomes their master. He can neither ignore their existen nor be simply their neighbor.
There is in nature one most potent force, by means whereof single man, who could possess himself of
it, and should know how to direct it, could revolutionize and change the face of the world.
This force was known to the ancients. It is a universal age whose supreme law is equilibrium; and whereby, if science can but learn how to control it, it will be possible to change the order of the
Seasons, to produce in night the phenomena of day, to send a thought in an instant round the world, to heal or slay at a distance, to give our words universal success, a make them reverberate everywhere.
This agent, partially revealed by the blind guesses of the disciples of Mesmer, is precisely what the
Adepts of the middle ages called the elementary matter of the great work. The Gnostics held that it composed the igneous body of the Holy Spirit; a it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the
Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphrodic goat of Mendes.
There is a LifePrinciple of the world, a universal agent, wherein are two natures and a double current, of love and wrath. This ambient fluid penetrates everything. It is a ray detached from the glory of the
Sun and fixed by the weight of the atmosphere and the central attraction. It is the body of the Holy Spirit, the universal Agent, the Serpent devouring his own tail. With this electromagnetic ether, this
vital and luminous caloric, the ancients and the alchemists were familiar. Of this agent, that phase of modern ignorance termed physical science talks incoherently, knowing naught of it save its effects and
theology might apply to it all its pretended definitions of spirit. Quiescent, it is appreciable by no human sense; disturbed or in movement, none can explain its mode of action and to term it a "fluid"
and speak of its "currents", is but to veil a profound ignorance under a cloud of words.

In schools, some pupils absorb the intellect of the others, and in every circle of men some one
individual is soon found, who possesses himself of the wills of the others.
Enthralments by currents is very common and one is carried away by the crowd, in morals as in physics. The human will has an almost absolute power in determining one's acts and every external
demonstration of a will has an influence on external things.
Tissot ascribed most maladies to disorders of the will, or the perverse influences of the wills of others. We become subject to the wills of others by the analogies of our inclinations, and still more by those of
our defects. To caress the weaknesses of an individual, is to possess ourself of him, and make of him an instrument in the order of the same errors or depravations. But when two natures, analogical in defects,
are subordinated one to the other, there is effected a kind of substitution of the stronger instead of the weaker, and a genuine imprisonment of one mind by the other. Often the weaker struggles and would
fain revolt and then falls lower than ever in servitude.
We each have some dominant defect, by which the enemy can grasp us. In some it is vanity, in others indolence, in most egotism. Let a cunning and evil spirit possess himself of this and you are lost. Then
you become, not foolish, nor an idiot, but positively a lunatic, the slave of an impulse from without. You have an instinctive horror for everything that could restore you to reason and will not even listen to
representations that contravene your insanity.
Miracles are the natural effects of exceptional causes.
The immediate action of the human will on bodies, or at least this action exercised without visible means, constitutes a miracle in the physical order.
The influence exercised on wills or intellects, suddenly or within a given time, and capable of taking
captive the thoughts, changing the firmest resolutions, paralyzing the most violent passions, constiuttes a miracle in the moral order.
The common error in relation to miracles is, to regard them as effects without causes; as contradictions
of nature; as sudden fictions of the Divine imagination; and men do not reflect that a single miracle of this sort would break the universal harmony and replunge the universe into Chaos.

There are miracles impossible to God Himself; absurd miracles are so. If God could be absurd for a single instant, neither He nor the Universe would exist an instant afterward. To expect of the Divine
FreeWill an effect whose cause is unacknowledged or does not exist, is what is termed tempting God. It is to precipitate one's self into the void.
God acts by His works in Heaven, by angels; on earth, by men.
In the heaven of human conceptions, it is humanity that creates God and men think that God has made
them in His image, because they make Him in theirs.
The domain of man is all corporeal nature, visible on earth and if he does not rule the planets or the stars, he can at least calculate their movement, measure their distances, and identify his will with their
influence; he can modify the atmosphere, act to a certain point on the seasons, cure and afflict with sickness other men, preserve life and cause death.
The absolute in reason and will is the greatest power which it is given to men to attain and it is by
means of this power that what the multitude admires under the name of miracles, are effected.
POWER is the wise use of the will, which makes Fatality itself serve to accomplish the purposes of Sages.
Omnipotence is the most absolute Liberty and absolute Liberty cannot exist without a perfect
equilibrium; and the columns JACHIN and BOAZ are also the unlimited POWER and SPLENDOR OF PERFECTION of the Deity, the seventh and eighth SEPHIROTH of the Kabalah, from whose
equilibrium result the eternal permanence and Stability of His plans and works, and of that perfect Success and undivided, unlimited Dominion, which are the ninth and tenth SEPHIROTH, and of which
the Temple of Solomon, in its stately symmetry, erected without the sound of any tool of metal being heard, is to us a symbol. "For Thine", says the Most Perfect of Prayers, "is the DOMINION, the
POWER and the GLORY, during all the ages, Amen!"
The ABSOLUTE is the very necessity of BEING, the immutable law of Reason and of Truth. It is THAT WHICH IS. BUT THAT WHICH IS is in some sort before HE WHO IS. God Himself is not
without a reason of existence. He does not exist accidentally He could not not have been. His Existence, then, is necessitated is necessary. He can exist only in virtue of a supreme and inevitable REASON.
That REASON, then, is THE ABSOLUTE; for it is in IT we must believe, if we would that our faith should have a reasonable and solid basis. It has been said in our times, that God is a Hypothesis; but
Absolute Reason is not one; it is essential to Existence.

Saint Thomas said, "A thing is not just because God wills it, BUT GOD WILLS IT BECAUSE IT IS
JUST". If he had deduced all the consequences of this fine thought, he would have discovered the true Philosopher's Stone; the magical elixir, to convert all the trials of the world into golden mercies.
Precisely as it is a necessity for God to BE, so it is a necessity for Him to be just, loving, and merciful. He cannot be unjust, cruel, merciless. He cannot repeal the law of right and wrong, of merit and
demerit; for the moral laws are as absolute as the physical laws.
There are impossible things. As it is impossible to make two and two be five and not four; as it is impossible to make a thing be and not be at the same time; so it is impossible for the Deity to make
crime a merit, and love and gratitude crimes. So, too, it was impossible to make Man perfect, with his bodily senses and appetites, as it was to make his nerves susceptible of pleasure and not also of pain.
Therefore, according to the idea of Saint Thomas, the moral laws are the enactments of the Divine
WILL, only because they are the decisions of the Absolute WISDOM and REASON, and the Revelations of the Divine NATURE. In this alone consists the right of Deity to enact them; and thus
only do we attain the certainty in Faith that the Universe is one Harmony.
To believe in the Reason of God, and in the God of Reason, is to make Atheism impossible. It is the Idolaters who have made the Atheists.
Analogy gives the Sage all the forces of Nature. It is the key of the Grand Arcanum, the root of the Tree
of Life, the science of Good and Evil.
The Absolute, is REASON. Reason IS, by means of Itself. It IS BECAUSE IT IS, and not because we suppose it. IT IS, where nothing exists but nothing could possibly exist without IT. Reason is Necessity,
Law, the Rule of all Liberty, and the direction of every Initiative. If God IS, HE IS by Reason. The conception of an Absolute Deity, outside of, or independent of, Reason, is the IDOL of Black Magic,
the PHANTOM of the Demon.
The Supreme Intelligence is necessarily rational. God, in philosophy, can be no more than a Hypothesis; but a Hypothesis imposed by good sense on Human Reason. To personify the Absolute
Reason, is to determine the Divine Ideal.
NECESSITY, LIBERTY and REASON! Behold the great and supreme Triangle of the Kabalists!

FATALITY, WILL and POWER! Such is the magical ternary which, in human things, corresponds with the Divine Triangle.
FATALITY is the inevitable linking together, in succession, of effects and causes, in a given order.
WILL is the faculty that directs the forces of the Intellect, so as to reconcile the liberty of persons with
the necessity of things,
The argument from these premises must be made by yourself. Each one of us does that. "Seek" say the Holy Writings, "and ye shall find". Yet discussion is not forbidden; and without doubt the subject will
be fully treated of in your hearing here after. Affirmation, negation, discussion, it is by these the truth is attained.
To explore the great Mysteries of the universe and seek to solve its manifold enigmas, is the chief use of
Thought, and constitutes the principal distinction between Man and the animals. Accordingly, in all ages the Intellect has labored to understand and explain to itself the Nature of the supreme Deity.
That one Reason and one Will created and governed the Universe was too evident not to be at once
admitted by the philosophers of all ages. It was the ancient religions that sought to multiply gods. The Nature of the One Deity, and the mode in which the Universe had its beginning, are questions that have
always been the racks in which the human intellect has been tortured and is chiefly with these that the Kabalists have dealt.
It is true that, in one sense, we can have no actual knowledge of the Absolute Itself, the very Deity. Our
means of obtaining what is commonly termed actual knowledge, are our senses only. If to see and feel be knowledge, we have none of our own Soul of electricity, of magnetism. We see and feel and taste an
acid or an alkali, and know something of the qualities of each; but it is only when we use them in combination with other substances, and learn their effects, that we really begin to know their nature. It
is the combination and experiments of Chemistry that give us a knowledge of the nature and powers of most animal and vegetable substances. As these are cognizable by inspection by our senses, we may
partially know them by that alone but the Soul, either of ourself or of another, being beyond that cognizance, can only be known by the acts and words which are its effects. Magnetism and electricity,
when at rest, are equally beyond the jurisdiction of the senses and when they are in action, we see, feel, hear, taste and smell only their effects. We do not know what they are, but only what they do. We can
know the attributes of Deity only through His manifestations. To ask anything more, is to ask, not knowledge, but something else, for which we have no name. God is a Power and we know nothing of
any Power itself, but only its effects, results, and action, and what Reason teaches us by analogy.

In these later days, in laboring to escape from all material ideas in regard to Deity, we have so refined
away our notions of GOD, as to have no idea of Him at all. In struggling to regard Him as a pure immaterial Spirit, we have made the word Spirit synonymous with nothing, and can only say that He is
a Somewhat, with certain attributes, such as Power, Wisdom, and Intelligence. To compare Him to LIGHT, would now be deemed not only unphilosophical, but the equivalent of Atheism; and we find it
necessary to excuse and pity the ancients for their inadequate and gross ideas of Deity, expressed in considering Him as the LightPrinciple, the invisible essence or substance from which visible Light
flows.
Yet our own holy writings continually speak of Him as Light and therefore the Tsabeans and the Kabala may well be pardoned for doing the same; especially since they did not regard Him as the visible Light
known to us, but as the Primordial EtherOcean from which light flows.
Before the creation, did the Deity dwell alone in the Darkness, or in the Light ? Did the Light coexist with Him, or was it created, after an eternity of darkness? If it coexisted, was it an effluence from
Him, filling all space as He also filled it, He and the Light at the same time filling the same place and every place?
MILTON says, expressing the Hebraic doctrine:
"Hail, Holy Light, offspring of Heaven firstborn, Or of th' Eternal, coeternal beam! May I express
thee unblamed, since God is Light. And never but in unapproached Light Dwelt from Eternity; dwelt then in Thee, Bright effluence of bright Essence uncreate".
"The LIGHT" says the Book Omschim, or Introduction to the Kabala, "supremest of all things, and
most Lofty, and Limitless, and styled INFINITE, can be attained unto by no cogitation or speculation and its VERY SELF is evidently withdrawn and removed beyond all intellection. It WAS, before all
things whatever, produced, created, formed, and made by Emanation and in it was neither Time, Head, or Beginning; since it always existed, and remains forever, without commencement or end".
"Before the Emanations flowed forth, and created things were created, the Supreme Light was infinitely
extended, and filled the whole WHERE; so that with reference to Light no vacuum could be affirmed, nor any unoccupied space; but the ALL was filled with that Light of the Infinite, thus extended,
whereto in every regard was no end, inasmuch as nothing was, except that extended Light, which with a certain single and simple equality, was everywhere like unto itself".

AINSOPH is called Light, says the Introduction to the Sohar because it is impossible to express it by any other word.
To conceive of God as an actuality and not as a mere nonsubstance or name, which involved non
existence, the Kabala, like the Egyptians, imagined Him to be "a most occult Light," AUR: not our material and visible Light, but the Substance out of which Light flows, the fire, as relative to its heat
and flame. Of this Light or Ether, the Sun was to the Tsabeans the only manifestation or outshining, and as such it was worshipped, and not as the type of dominion and power. God was the Phos Noeton,
the Light cognizable only by the Intellect, the LightPrinciple, the Light Ether, from which souls emanate, and to which they return.
Light, Fire and Flame, with the Phoenicians, were the sons of Kronos. They are the Trinity in the
Chaldaean Oracles, the AOR of the Deity, manifested in flame, that issues out of the invisible Fire.
In the first three Persian Amshaspands, Lords of LIGHT, FIRE and SPLENDOR, we recognize the AOR, ZOHAR and ZAYO, Light, Splendor and Brightness, of the Kabalah. The first of these is termed
AOR MUPALA, Wonderful or Hidden Light, unrevealed, undisplayed which is KETHER the first Emanation or Sephirah, the Will of Deity: the second is NESTAR, Concealed which is HAKEMAH,
the second Sephirah, or the Intellectual Potence of the Deity: and the third is METANOTSATS, coruscating which is BINAH, the third Sephirah, or the intellectual producing capacity. In other words,
they are THE VERY SUBSTANCE of light, in the Deity. Fire, which is that light, limited and furnished with attributes, so that it can be revealed, but yet remains unrevealed and its splendor or outshining, or
the light that goes out from the fire.
Masonry is a search after Light. That search leads us directly back, as you see, to the Kabalah. In that ancient and little understood medley of absurdity and philosophy, the Initiate will find the source of
many doctrines and may in time come to understand the Hermetic philosophers, the Alchemists, all the Antipapal Thinkers of the Middle Ages, and Emanuel Swedenborg.
The Hansavati Rich, a celebrated Sanscrit Stanza, says: "He is Hansa (the Sun), dwelling in light; Vasu,
the atmosphere dwelling in the firmament; the invoker of the gods (Agni), dwelling on the altar (i.e., the altar fire); the guest (of the worshipper). Dwelling in the house (the domestic fire); the dweller
amongst men (as consciousness); the dweller in the most excellent orb, (the Sun); the dweller in truth; the dweller in the sky (the air); born in the waters, in the rays of light, in the verity (of manifestation),
in the Eastern mountains; the Truth (itself)".
"In the beginning," says a Sanskrit hymn, "arose the Source of golden light. He was the only born Lord of all that is. He established the earth and the sky. Who is the God to Whom we shall offer our

sacrifice?"
"He who gives life, He who gives strength; Whose blessing all the bright gods desire; Whose shadow is immortality; Whose shadow is death; Who is the God, etc?"
"He through Whom the sky is bright and the earth for us; He through Whom the Heaven was
established, nay, the highest Heaven; He who measured out the light in the air; Who is the God, etc?"
"He to Whom the Heaven and earth, standing firm by His will, look up trembling inwardly; He over Whom the rising sun shines forth; Who is the God, etc?"
"Whenever the mighty waterclouds went, where they placed the seed and lit the fire, thence arose He
Who is the only life of the bright gods; Who is the God! etc?"
The WORD of God, said the Indian philosophy, is the universal and invisible Light, cognizable by the senses, that emits its blaze in the Sun, Moon, Planets, and other Stars. Philo calls it the "Universal
Light," which loses a portion of its purity and splendor in descending from the intellectual to the sensible world, manifesting itself outwardly from the Deity; and the Kabalah represents that only so
much of the Infinite Light flowed into the circular void prepared for creation within the Infinite Light and Wisdom, as could pass by a canal like a line or thread. The Sephiroth, emanating from the Deity,
were the rays of His splendor.
The Chaldean Oracles said: "The intellect of the Generator, stirred to action, outspoke, forming within itself, by intellection universals of every possible form and fashion, which issued out, flowing forth
from the One Source. For Deity, impersonated as Donlinion, before fabricating the manifold Universe, posited an intellected and unchangeable universal, the impression of the form whereof goes forth
through the Universe and that Universe formed and fashioned accordingly, becomes visibly beautified in infinitely varying types and forms, the Source and fountain whereof is one. Intellectual conceptions
and forms from the Generative source, succeeding each other, considered in relation to everprogressing Time, and intimately partaking of THE PRIMAL ETHER or FIRE; but yet all these Universals and
Primal Types and Ideas flowed forth from, and are part of, the first Source of the Generative Power, perfect in itself."
The Chaldeans termed the Supreme Deity ARAOR, Father of Light. From Him was supposed to flow
the light above the world, which illuminates the heavenly regions. This Light or Fire was considered as the Symbol of the Divine Essence, extending itself to inferior spiritual natures. Hence the Chaldean
oracles say: "The Father took from Himself and did not confine His proper fire within His intellectual

546/641
potency", "All things are begotten from one Fire."
The Tsabeans held that all inferior spiritual beings were emanations from the supreme Deity and therefore Proclus says: "The progression of the gods is one and continuous, proceeding downward from
the intelligible and latent unities and terminating in the last partition of the Divine cause".
It is impossible to speak clearly of the Divinity. Whosoever attempts to express His attributes by the help of abstractions, confines himself to negatives, and at once loses sight of his ideas, in wandering
through a wilderness of words. To heap Superlatives on Superlatives and call Him best, wisest, greatest, is but to exaggerate qualities which are found in man. That there exists one only God, and that He is a
Perfect and Beneficent Being, Reason legitimately teaches us; but of the Divine Nature, of the Substance of the Deity, of the manner of His Existence, or of the mode of creation of His Universe, the
human mind is inadequate to form any just conception. We can affix no clear ideas to Omnipotence, Omniscience, Infinity or Eternity and we have no more right to attribute intelligence to Him, than any
other mental quality of ourselves, extended indefinitely; or than we have to attribute our senses to Him and our bodily organs, as the Hebrew writings do.
We satisfy ourselves with negativing in the Deity everything that constitutes existence, so far as we are
capable of conceiving of existence. Thus He becomes to us logically nothing, NonEns. The Ancients saw no difference between that and Atheism and sought to conceive of Him as something real. It is a
necessity of Human Nature. The theological idea, or rather nonidea, of the Deity, is not shared or appreciated by the unlearned. To them, God will always be The Father Who is in Heaven, a Monarch on
His Throne, a Being with human feelings and human sympathies, angry at their misdeeds, lenient if they repent, accessible to their supplications. It is the Humanity, far more than the Divinity, of Christ,
that makes the mass of Christians worship Him, far more than they do the Father.
"The Light of the Substance of The Infinite," is the Kabalistic expression. Christ was, according to Saint John, "the Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" and "that Light was the life
of men." "The Light shone in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not."
The ancient ideas in respect to Light were perhaps quite as correct as our own. It does not appear that they ascribed to Light any of the qualities of matter. But modern Science defines it to be a flood of
particles of matter, flowing or shot out from the Sun and Stars and moving through space to come to us. On the theories of mechanism and force, what force of attraction here or repulsion at the Sun or at the
most distant Star could draw drive these impalpable, weightless, infinitely minute particles, appreciably by the Sense of sight alone, so far through space? What has become of the immense aggregate of
particles that have reached the earth since the creation? Have they increased its bulk? Why cannot chemistry detect and analyze them? If matter, why can they travel only in right lines?

No characteristic of matter belongs to Light, or Heat, or flame or to Galvanism, Electricity, and
Magnetism. The electric spark is light and so is that produced by the flint, when it cuts off particles of steel. Iron, melted or heated, radiates light; and insects, infusoria and decayed wood emit it. Heat is
produced by friction and by pressure; to explain which, Science tells us of latent Caloric, thus representing it to us as existing without its only known distinctive quality. What quality of matter
enables lightning blazing from the Heavens, to rend the oak? What quality of matter enables it to make the circuit of the earth in a score of seconds?
Profoundly ignorant of the nature of these mighty agents of Divine Power, we conceal our ignorance by
words that have no meaning; and we might well be asked why Light may not be an effluence from the Deity, as has been agreed by all the religions of all the Ages of the World.
All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return to it. Everything scientific and
grand in the religious dreams of all the illuminati, Jacob Boehme, Swedenborg, Saint Martin and others, is borrowed from the Kabalah; all the Masonic associations owe to it their Secrets and their
Symbols.
The Kabalah alone consecrates the alliance of the Universal Reason and the Divine Word; it establishes, by the counterpoises of two forces apparently opposite, the eternal balance of being; it
alone reconciles Reason with Faith, Power with Liberty, Science with Mystery; it has the keys of the Present, the Past and Future.
The Bible, with all the allegories it contains, expresses, in an incomplete and veiled manner only, the
religious science of the Hebrews. The doctrine of Moses and the Prophets, identical at bottom with that of the ancient Egyptians, also had its outward meaning and its veils. The Hebrew books were written
only to recall to memory the traditions and they were written in Symbols unintelligible to the Profane. The Pentateuch and the prophetic poems were merely elementary books of doctrine, morals, or liturgy;
and the true secret and traditional philosophy was written afterward, under veils still less transparent. Thus was a second Bible born, unknown to, or rather uncomprehended by, the Christians; a collection,
they say, of monstrous absurdities; a monument, the adept says, wherein is everything that the genius of philosophy and that of religion have ever formed or imagined of the sublime; a treasure surrounded by
thorns; a diamond concealed in a rough dark stone.
One is filled with admiration, on penetrating into the Sanctuary of the Kabalah, at seeing a doctrine so logical, so simple, and at the same time so absolute. The necessary union of ideas and signs, the
consecration of the most fundamental realities by the primitive characters; the Trinity of Words, Letters, and Numbers; a philosophy simple as the alphabet, profound and infinite as the Word; theorems more

complete and luminous than those of Pythagoras; a theology summed up by counting on one's fingers; an Infinite which can be held in the hollow of an infant's hand; ten ciphers, and twentytwo letters, a
triangle, a square, and a circle, these are all the elements of the Kabalah. These are the elementary principles of the written Word, reflection of that spoken Word that created the world!
This is the doctrine of the Kabalah, with which you will no doubt seek to make yourself acquainted, as
to the Creation.
The Absolute Deity, with the Kabalists, has no name. The terms applied to Him are AOR PASOT, the Most Simple [or Pure] Light, "called AYEN SOPHI, or INFINITE, before any Emanation. For then
there was no space or vacant place, but all was infinite Light."
Before the Deity created any Ideal, any limited and intelligible Nature, or any form whatever, He was alone, and without form or similitude, and there could be no cognition or comprehension of Him in any
wise. He was without Idea or Figure and it is forbidden to form any Idea or Figure of Him, neither by the letter He nor by the letter Yod though these are contained in the Holy Name; nor by any other letter
or point in the World.
But after He created this Idea [this limited and existinginintellection Nature, which the ten Numerations, SEPHIROTH or Rays are], of the Medium, the First Man ADAM KADMON, He
descended therein, that, by means of this Idea, He might be called by the name TETRAGRAMMATON; that created things might have cognition of Him, in His own likeness.
When the Infinite God willed to emit what were to flow forth, He contracted Himself in the centre of
His light, in such manner that most intense light should recede to a certain circumference, and on all sides upon itself. And this is the first contraction, and termed Tsemsum.
ADAM KADMON, the Primal or First Man, is the first Aziluthic emanant from the Infinite Light,
immitted into the evacuated Space, and from which, afterward, all the other degrees and systems had their beginnings. It is called the Adam prior to all the first. In it are imparted ten spherical numerations;
and thereafter issued forth the rectilinear figure of a man in his sephirothic decade, as it were the diameter of the said circles; as it were the axis of these spheres, reaching from their highest point to
their lowest and from it depend all the systems.
But now, as the Infinite Light would be too excellent and great to be borne and endured, except through the medium of this Adam Kadmon, its most Secret Nature preventing this, its illuminating light had
again to emanate in streams out of itself, by certain apertures, as it were, like windows, and which are

549/641
termed the ears, eyes, nostrils and mouth.
The light proceeding from this Adam Kadmon is indeed but one; but in proportion to its remoteness from the place of outflowing and to the grades of its descent, it is more dense.
From the word ATSIL, to emanate or flow forth, comes the word ATSILOTH or Aziluth, Emanation, or
the system of Emanants. When the primal space was evacuated, the surrounding Light of the Infinite and the Light immitted into the void, did not touch each other; but the Light of the Infinite flowed into
that void through a line or certain slender canal and that Light is the Emanative and emitting Principle, or the outflow and origin of Emanation: but the Light within the void is the emanant subordinate and
the two cohere only by means of the aforesaid line.
Aziluth means specifically and principally the first system of the four Olamoth, worlds or systems; which is thence called the Aziluthic World
The ten Sephiroth of the general Aziluthic system are ten Nekudoth or Points.
AINSOPH, AENSOPH, or AYENSOPH, is the title of the Cause of Causes, its meaning being
"endless," because there is no limit to Its loftiness and nothing can comprehend it. Sometimes, also, the name is applied to KETHER, or the CROWN, the first emanation, because that is the Throne of the
Infinite, that is, its first and highest Seat, than which none is higher, and because Ainsoph resides and is concealed therein: hence it rejoices in the same name.
Before anything was, says the Emech Hammelech, He, of His mere will, proposed to Himself to make
worlds. But at that time there was no vacant space for worlds; but all space was filled with the light of His Substance, which He had with fixed limits placed in the centre of Himself and of the parts whereof
and wherein, He was thereafter to effect a folding together.
What then did the Lord of the Will, that most perfectly free Agent, do? By His own estimation, He measured off within His own Substance the width and length of a circular space to be made vacant and
wherein might be posited the worlds aforesaid; and of that Light which was included within the circle so measured, He compressed and folded over a certain portion and that Light He lifted higher up, and
so a place was left unoccupied by the Primal Light.
But yet was not this space left altogether empty of that Light; for the vestiges of the Primal Light still remained in the place where Itself had been and they did not recede therefrom.

Before the Emanations outflowed and things were created, the supreme Light was infinitely extended
and filled the whole where nothing was, except that extended light called AOR H'AINSOPH, the Light of the nonfinite.
When it came into the mind of the Extended to will to make worlds and by forthflowing to utter
Emanations, and to emit as Light the perfection of His active powers, and of His aspects and attributes, which was the impelling cause of the creation of worlds; then that Light, in some measure compressed,
receded in every direction from a particular central point and on all sides of it drew back and so a certain vacuum was left, called void space, its circumference everywhere equidistant from that point
which was exactly in the centre of the space; a certain void place and space left in MidInfinite a certain Where was thereby constituted wherein Emanations might BE and the Created, the Fashioned and the
Fabricated.
This world of the garmenting, this circular vacant space, with the vestiges of the withdrawn light of the Infinite yet remaining, is the inmost garment, nearest to His substance and to it belongs the name AOR
PENAIAL, Light of the Countenance of God.
An interspace surrounds this great circle, established between the light of the very substance, surrounding the circle on its outside, and the substance contained within the circle. This is called
SPLENDOR EXCELSUS, in contradistinction to Simple Splendor.
This light "of the vestige of the garment," is said to be relatively to that of the vestige of the substance, like a point in the centre of a circle. This light, a point in the centre of the Great Light, is called Auir,
Ether, or Space.
This Ether is somewhat more gross than the Light not so Subtle though not perceptible by the Senses is termed the Primal Ether extends everywhere; Philosophers call it the Soul of the World.
The Light so forthshown from the Deity, cannot be said to be severed or diverse from Him. "It is
flashed forth from yet all continues to be perfect unity. The Sephiroth, sometimes called the Persons of the Deity, are His rays, by which He is enabled most perfectly to manifest Himself.
The Introduction to the Book SOHAR says:

The first compression was effected, in order that the Primal Light might be upraised, and a space become vacant. The second compression occurred when the vestiges of the removed Light remaining
were compressed into points; and that compression was effected by means of the emotion of joy; the Deity rejoicing, it had already been said, on account of His Holy People, thereafter to come into being;
and that joy being vehement and a commotion and exhilaration in the Deity being caused by it, so that He flowed forth in His delight and of this commotion an abstract power of judgment being generated,
which is a collection of the letters generated by the points of the vestiges of Light left within the circle. For He writes the finite expressions, or limited manifestations of Himself upon the Book, in single
letters.
Like as when water or fire, it had been said, is blown upon by the wind, it is wont to be greatly moved, and with flashes like lightning to smite the eyes and gleam and coruscate hither and thither, even so The
Infinite was moved within Himself and shone and coruscated in that circle, from the centre outward and again to the centre and that commotion we term exhilaration; and from that exhilaration, variously
divided within Himself, was generated the potency of determining the fashioning of the letters.
Of that exhilaration, it had also been said, was generated the determination of forms, by which determination the Infinite determined them within Himself, as if by saying: "Let this Sphere be the
appointed place, wherein let all worlds be created!"
He, by radiating and coruscating, effected the points, so that their sparkling should smite the eyes like lightning. Then He combined diversely the single points, until letters were fashioned thereof, in the
similitude and image of those wherewith THE BLESSED had set forth the decrees of His Wisdom.
It is not possible to attain to an understanding of the creation of man, except by the mystery of letters and in these worlds of The Infinite is nothing, except the letters of the Alpllabet and their combinations.
All the worlds are Letters and Names; but He Who is the Author of all, has no name.
This world of the covering [or garment vestimenti], [that is, the circular vacant space, with the vestiges of the removed Light of The Infinite still remaining after the first contraction and compression], is the
inmost covering, nearest to His substance and to this covering belongs the general name AUR PENIAL, Light of the Countenance of God; by which we are to understand the Light of The Substance.
And after this covering was effected, He contracted it, so as to lift up the lower moiety and this is the
third contraction and in this manner He made vacant a space for the worlds, which had not the capacity to use the great Light of the covering, the end whereof was lucid and excellent as its beginning. And so
[by drawing up the lower half and half the letters], are made the Male and Female, that is the anterior and posterior adhering mutually to one another.

The vacant space effected by this retraction is called AUIR KADMON, the PRIMAL SPACE; for it was
the first of all Spaces; nor was it allowable to call it covering, which is AUR PENIBAL, the Light of the Countenance of God.
The vestiges of the Light of the Garment still remained there. And this world of the garment has a name
that includes all things, which is the name IHUH. Before the world of the vacant space was created, HE was and His Name and they alone; that is, AINSOPH and His garmenting.
The EMECH HAMMELECH says again:
The lower half of the garment [by the third retraction], was left empty of the light of the garment. Rut
the veitiges of that light remained in the place so vacated and this garment is called SHEKINAH, God indwelling; that is, the place where Yod He, of the anterior [or male], and Vav He, of the posterior [or
female], combinations of letters dwelt.
This vacant space was square and is called the Primal Space and in Kabalah it is called Auira Kadmah, or Rasimu Ailah, The Primal Space, or The Sublime Vestige. It is the vestige of the Light of the
Garment, with which is intermingled somewhat of the vestige of the Very Substance. It is called Primal Ether, but not void Space. The Light of the Vestige still remains in the place it occupied, and adheres
there, like somewhat spiritual, of extreme tenuity.
In this Ether are two Lights; that is, the Light of the SUBSTANCE, which was taken away, and that of the Garment. There is a vast difference between the two; for that of the Vestige of the Garment is,
relatively to that of the Vestige of the Substance, like a point in the centre of a circle. And as the only appropriate name for the Light of the Vestige of Ainsoph is AUR, Light, therefore the Light of the
Vestige of the Garment could not be called by that name; and so we term it a point, that is, Yod, which is that point in the centre of Light and Light, a point in the centre of the Great Light, is called Auir,
Ether or Space.
This Ether is somewhat more gross than The Light not so subtle, though not perceptible by the senses is termed the Primal Ether extends everywhere; whence the Philosophers call it The Soul of the World
Light is visible, though not perceptible. This Ether is neither perceptible nor visible.

Worlds could not be framed in this Primal Ether, on account of its extreme tenuity and the excess of Light and also because in it remained the vital Spirit of the Vestige of the Light Ainsoph and that of the
Vestige of the Light of the Garment; whereby such manifestation was prevented.
Wherefore HE directed the letter Yod, since it was not so brilliant as the Primal Ether, to descend, and take to itself the light remaining in the Primal Ether, and return above, With that Vestige which so
impeded the manifestation; which Yod did.
It descended below five times, to remove the vital Spirit of the Vestige of the Light Ainsoph; and the Vestige of the Light and vital Spirit of the Garment from the Sphere of Splendor, so as to make of it
ADAM, called KADMON. And by its return, manifestation is effected in the space below and a Vestige of the Sublime Brilliance yet remains there, existing as a Spherical Shape, and termed in the Sohar
simply Tehiru, that is Splendor and it is styled The First Matter.... it being, as it were, vapor and as it were, smoke. And as smoke is formless, not comprehended under any fixed definite form, so this
Sphere is a formless somewhat, since it seems to be somewhat that is spherical, and yet is not limited.
The letter Yod, while adhering to the Shekinah, had adhering to himself the Light of the Shekinah, though his light was not so great as that of the Shekinah. But when he descended, he left that light of
his own below and the Splendor consisted of it. After which there was left in Yod only a vestige of that light, inasmuch as he could not reascend to the Shekinah and adhere to it. Wherefore The Holy and
Blessed directed the letter He [the female letter], to communicate to Yod of her Light; and sent him forth, to descend and share with that light in the Splendor aforesaid and when he redescended into the
Sphere of Splendor, he diffused abroad in it the Light communicated to him by the letter He.
And when he again ascended he left behind him the productive light of the letter He, and thereof was constituted another Sphere, within the Sphere of Splendor; which lesser Sphere is termed in Sohar
KETHER AILAH, CORONA SUMMA, The Supreme Crown, and also ATIKA DE ATIKIM, Antiquus Antiquum, The Ancient of Ancients, and even AILIT H' AILIT, Causa Causarum, the Cause of Causes.
But the Crown is very far smaller than the Sphere of Splendor, so that within the latter an immense unoccupied place and space is still left.
The BETH ALOHIM says:
Before the Infinite God, the Supreme and First Good, formed objectively within Himself a particular
conception, definite, limited and the object of intellection, and gave form and shape to an intellectual conception and image. HE was alone, companionless, without form or similitude, utterly without Ideal
or Figure. It is forbidden to make of Him any figure whatever, by any image in the world, neither by the letter He nor by the letter Yod, nor by any other letter or point in the world.

554/641
But after He had formed this Idea, the particular conception limited and intelligible, which the Ten
Numerations are, of the medium of transmission, Adam Kadmon, the Primal or Supreme Man, He by that medium descended, and may, through that Idea, be called by the name IHUH, and so created things
have cognizance of Him, by means of His proper likeness.
Woe unto him who makes God to be like unto any mode or attribute whatever, even were it to one of His own and still more if he make Him like unto the Sons of Men, whose elements are earthly, and so
are consumed and perish!
There can be no conception had of Him, except in so far as He manifests Himself, in exercising dominion by and through some attribute. Abstracted from this, there can be no attribute, conception, or
ideal of Him. He is comparable only to the Sea, filling some great reservoir, its
bed in the earth, for example; wherein it fashions for itself a certain concavity, so that thereby we may
begin to compute the dimensions of the Sea itself.
For example, the Spring and Source of the Ocean is a somewhat, which is one. If from this Source or spring there issues forth a certain fountain, proportioned to the space occupied by the Sea in that
hemispherical reservoir, such as is the letter Yod, there the Source of Spring is the first somewhat, and the fountain that flows forth from it is the second.
Then let there be made a great reservoir, as by excavation and let this be called the Ocean, and we have
the third thing, a vessel [Vas]. Now let this great reservoir be divided into seven beds of rivers, that is, into seven oblong reservoirs, so that from this ocean the waters may flow forth in seven rivers and the
Source, Fountain and Ocean thus make ten in all.
The Cause of Causes made ten Numerations and called the Source of Spring KETHER, Corona, the Crown, in which the idea of circularity is involved, for there is no end to the outflow of Light; and
therefore He called this, like Himself, endless; for this also, like Him, has no similitude or configuration, nor hath it any vessel or receptacle wherein it may be contained, or by means whereof
any possible cognizance can be had of it.
After thus forming the Crown, He constituted a certain smaller receptacle, the letter Yod, and filled it from that source and this is called "The Fountain gushing with Wisdom" and manifested in this, He
called Himself WISE and the vessel He called HAKEMAH, Wisdom, Sapientia.

555/641
Then He also constituted a great reservoir, which He called the Ocean and to it He gave the name of BINAH, Understanding, Intelligentia. In this He characterized Himself as Intelligent or Conceiver. HE
is indeed the Absolutely wise and Intelligent, but Hakemah is not Absolute Wisdom of itself, but is wise by means of Binah, who fills Himself from it and if this supply were taken from it, would be dry
and unintelligent.
And thereupon seven precious vessels become, to which are given the following names: GEDULAH, Magnificence or Benignity [or KHASED, Mercy]; GEBURAH, Austerity, Rigor or Severity;
TEPHARETH, Beauty; METSAKH, Victory; HOD, Glory; YESOD, Foundation or Basis; and MALAKOTH, Rule, Reign, Royalty, Dominion or Power. And in GEDULAH He took the character of
Great and Benignant; in GEBURAH, of Severe; in TEPHARETH, of Beautiful; in NETSAKH, of Overcoming; in HOD, of Our Glorious Author; in YESOD, of Just, by Yesod all vessels and worlds
being upheld and in MALAKOTH He applied to Himself the title of King.
These numerations or Sephiroths are held in the Kabala to have been originally contained in each other; that is, Kether contained the nine others, Hakemah contained Binah and Binah contained the last seven.
For all things, says the commentary of Rabbi Jizchak Lorja, in a certain most ahstruse manner, consist
or reside and are contained in Binah and it projects them and sends them downward, species by species, into the several worlds of Emanation, Creation, Formation and Fabrication: all whereof are derived
from what are above them and are termed their outflowings; for from the potency which was their state there, they descend into actuality.
The INTRODUCTION says:
It is said in many places in the Sohar, that all things that emanate or are created have their root above.
Hence also the Ten Sephiroth have their root above, in the world of the garment, with the very Substance of HIM. And AINSOPH had full consciousness and appreciation, prior to their actual
existence, of all the Grades and Impersonations contained unmanifested within Himself, with regard to the essence of each and its domination then in potency. When He came to the Sephirah of the
Impersonation Malakoth, which He then contained hidden within Himself, He concluded within himself that therein worlds should be framed; since the scale of the first nine Sephiroths was so
ccnstituted, that it was neither fit nor necessary for worlds to be framed from them; for all the attributes of these nine Superior Sephiroth could be assigned to Himself, even if He should never operate
outwardly; but Malakoth, which is Empire or Dominion, could not be attributed to Him, unless He ruled over other Existences; whence from the point Malakoth He produced all the worlds into actuality.
These circles are ten in number. Originated by points, they expanded in circular shape. Ten Circles,

556/641
under the mystery of the ten Sephiroth, and between them ten Spaces; whence it appears that the sphere of Splendor is in the centre of the space Malakoth of the First Occult Adam.
The First Adam, in the ten circles above the Splendor, is called the First occult Adam; and in each of
these spaces are formed many thousand worlds. The first Adam is involved in the Primal Ether and is the analogue of the world Binah.
Again the Introduction repeats the first and second descent of Yod into the vacated space, to make the
light there less great and subtle; the constitution of the Tehiru, Splendor, from the light left behind there by him; the communication of Light to him by the female letter He; the emission by him of that Light,
within the sphere of Splendor and the formation thereof, within the sphere, "of a certain sphere called the Supreme crown," Corona Summa, KETHER, "wherein were contained, in potence, all the
remaining Numerations, so that they were not distinguishable from it. Precisely as in man exist the four elements, in potence specifically undistinguishable, so in this Corona were in potence all the ten
Numerations, specifically undistinguishable." This Crown, it is added, was called, after the restoration, The Cause of Causes, and the Ancient of the Ancients.
The point, Kether, adds the Introduction, was the aggregate of all the Ten when it first emanated, it
consisted of all the Ten and the Light which extended from the Emanative Principle simultaneously flowed into it and beheld the two Universals [that is, the Unities out of which manifoldness flows; as for
example, the idea within the Deity, of Humanity as a Unit, out of which the individuals were to flow], the Vessel or Receptacle containing this immitted Light, and the Light Itself within it. And this Light is
the Substance of the point Kether; for the WILL of God is the Soul of all things that are.
The Ainsophic Light, it had said, was infinite in every direction and without end or limit. To prevent it from flowing into and refilling the quasivacant space, occupied by an infinitely less Splendor, a
partition between the greater and lesser Splendor was necessary and this partition, the boundary of the sphere of Splendor, and a like one bounding the sphere Kether, were called Vessels or Receptacles,
containing, including and enclosing within themselves the light of the sphere. Imagine a sea of pellucid water, and in the centre of it a spherical mass of denser and darker water. The outer surface of this
sphere, or its limits every way, is the vessel containing it. The Kabalah regards the vessels "as by their nature somewhat opaque, and not so splendid as the light they enclose."
The contained Light is the Soul of the vessels and is active in them, like the Human Soul in the human
body. The Light of the Emanative Principle [Ainsoph] inheres in the vessels, as their Life, internal Light, and Soul. Kether emanated, with its Very Substance, at the same time as Substance and Vessel,
in like manner as the flame is annexed to the live coal and as the Soul pervades and is within, the body. All the Numerations were potentially contained in it.

And this potentiality is thus explained: When a woman conceives, a Soul is immediately sent into the
embryo which is to become the infant, in which Soul are then, potentially, all the members and veins of the body, which afterward, from that potency of the Soul, become in the human body of the child to be
born.
Then the wisdom of God commanded that these Numerations potentially in Kether, should be produced from potentiality into actuality, in order that worlds might consist and HE directed Yod again to
descend, and to enter into and shine within Kether, and then to reascend; which was so done. From which illumination and reascension, all the other numerations, potentially in Kether, were manifested
and disclosed; but they continued still compacted together, remaining within Kether in a circle.
When God willed to produce the other emanations or numerations from Kether, it is added, HE sent Yod down again, to the upper part of Kether, onehalf of him to remain without and one half to
penetrate within the sphere of Kether. Then HE sent the letter Vav into the Splendor, to pour out its light on Yod and thus, Yod received light from Vav, and thereby so directed his countenance that it
should illuminate and confer exceeding great energy on Hakemah, which yet remained in Kether; so giving it the faculty to proceed forth therefrom; and that it might collect and contain within itself and
there reveal, all the other eight numerations, until that time in Kether.
The sphere of Kether opened, and thereout issued Hakemah, to remain below Kether, containing in itself all the other numerations.
By a similar process, Binah, illuminated within Hakemah by a second Yod, "issued forth out of
Hakemah, having within itself the Seven lower Numerations."
And since the vessel of Binah was excellent and coruscated with rays of the color of sapphire, and was so nearly of the same color as the vessel of Hakemah that there was scarcely any difference between
them, hence it would not quietly remain below Hakemah, but rose, and placed itself on his left side.
And because the light from above profusely flowed into and accumulated in the vessel of Hakemah, to so great an extent that it overflowed and escaped, coruscating, outside of that vessel and flowing off to
the left, communicated potency and increase to the vessel of Binah; for Binah is female. Binah, therefore, by means of this energy that flowed into it from the left side of Hakemah, by virtue of the
second Yod, came to possess such virtue and potency, as to project beyond itself the Seven remaining vessels contained within itself and so emitted them all, continuously, one after the other all connected
and linked one with the other, like the links of a chain.

Three points first emanated, one under the other; Kether, Hakemah and Binah and so far, there was no
copulation. But afterward the positions of Hakemah and Binah changed, so that they were side by side, Kether remaining above theml; and then conjunction of the Male and Female, ABA and IMMA, Father
and Mother, as points.
He, from Whom all emanated, created Adam Kadmon, consisting of all the worlds, so that in him should be somewhat from those above and somewhat from those below. Hence in Him was
NEPHESCH [PSYCHE, anima infima, the lowest spiritual part of man, Soul], from the world ASIAH, which is one letter He of the Tetragrammaton; RUACH [SPIRITUS, anima media, the next higher
spiritual part, or Spirit], from the world YEZIRAH, which is the Vav of the Tetragrammaton; NESCHAMAH [the highest spiritual part, mens or anima superior], from the world BRIAH, which is
the other letter He and NESCHAMAH LENESCHAMAH, from the world ATSILUTH, which is the YOD of the Tetragrammaton.
And these letters [the Sephiroth] were changed from the spherical form into the form of a person, the
symbol of which person is the BALANCE, it being Male and Female; Hakemah on one side, Binah on the other and Kether over them and so Gedulah on one side, Geburah on the other, and Tephareth under
them.
The Book Omschim says: some hold that the ten Sephiroth succeeded one another in ten degrees, one above the other, in regular gradation, one connected with the other in a direct line, from the highest to
the lowest.
Others hold that they issued forth in three lines, parallel with each other, one on the right and, one on the left, and one in the middle; so that, beginning with the highest and going down to the lowest,
Hakemah, Khased [or Gedulah] and Netsach are one over the other, in a perpendicular line, on the right hand; Binah, Geburah and Hod on the left and Kether, Tephareth, Yesod and Malakoth in the middle
and many hold that all the ten subsist in circles, one within the other and all homocentric.
It is also to be noted, that the Sephirothic tables contain still another numeration, sometimes called also a Sephirah, which is called Daath, cognition. It is in the middle, below Hakemah and Binah and is the
result of the conjunction of these two.
To Adam Kadmon, the Idea of the Universe, the Kabalah assigns a human form. In this, Kether is the cranium, Hakemah and Binah the two lobes of the brain, Gedulah and Geburah the two arms, Tephareth
the trunk, Netsach and Hod the thighs, Yesod the male organ, and Malkuth the female organ, of

generation.
Yod is Hakemah and He Binah; Vav is Tephareth and the last He, Malkuth.
The whole, say the Books Mysterii or of Occultation, is thus summed up: The intention of God The Blessed was to form Impersonations, in order to diminish the Light. Wherefore HE constituted, in
Macroprosopos, Adam Kadmon, or Arik Anpin; three Heads. The first is called, "The Head whereof is no cognition"; the second, "The Head of that which is nonexistent" and the third, "The Very Head of
Macroprosopos"; and these three are Corona, Sapientia, and Informatio, Kether, Hakemah, and Binall, existent in the Corona of the World of Emanation, or in Macroprosopos; and these three are called in
the Sohar ATIKA KADISCHA, Senex Sanctissimus, The Most Holy Ancient. But the Seven inferior Royalties of the first Adam are called "The Ancient of Days" and this Ancient of Days is the internal
part, or Soul, of Macroprosopos.
The human mind has never struggled harder to understand and explain to itself the process of creation, and of Divine manifestation and at the same time to conceal its thoughts from all but the initiated, than
in the Kabalah. Hence, much of it seems at first like jargon. Macroprosopos or Adam Kadmon is, we have said, the idea or intellectual aggregate of the whole Universe, include and contained unevolved in
the manifested Deity, Himself ye contained unmanifested in the Absolute. The Head, Kether "whereof is no cognition," is the Will of the Deity, or the Deity as Will. Hakemah, the head "of that which is non
existent," the Generative Power of begetting or producing Thought; yet in the Deity, not in action and therefore nonexistent. Bina "the very or actual head" of Macroprosopos, is the productive intellectual
capacity, which, impregnated by Hakemah, is to produce the Thought. This Thought is Daath; or rather, the result is Intellection, Thinking; the Unity, of which Thoughts are the manifold outflowings.
This may be illustrated by a comparison. Pain, in the human being, is a feeling or sensation. It must be
produced. To produce it, there must be, not only the capacity to produce it, in the nerves, but also the power of generating it by means of that capacity. This generative Power, the Passive Capacity which
produces, and the pain produced, are like Hakemah, Binah, and Daath.
The four Worlds or Universals, Aziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Asiah, of Emanation, creation, Formation, and Fabrication, are another enigma of the Kabalah. The first three are wholly within the Deity. The
first is the Universe, as it exists potentially in the Deity, determined and imagined, but as yet wholly formless and undeveloped, except so far as it is contained in His Emanations. The second is the
universe in idea, distinct within the Deity, but not invested with forms; a simple unity. The third is the same Universe in potence in the Deity, unmanifested, but invested with forms; the idea developed into
manifoldness and individuality, and succession of species and individuals; and the fourth is the potentiality become the Actuality, the Universe fabricated, and existing as it exists for us.

The Sephiroth, says the Porta Coelorum, by the virtue of their Infinite Emanator, who uses them as a
workman uses his tools, and who operates with and through them, are the cause of existence of everything created, formed, and fashioned, employing in their production certain media. But these same
Sephiroth, Persons and Lights, are not creatures per se, but ideas, and Rays of THE INFINITE, which, by different gradations, so descended from the supreme Source as still not to be severed from It; but It
through them, is extended to the production and government of all Entities and is the Single and Perfect Universal Cause of All, though becoming determinate for this or the other operation, through this or
that Sephiroth or MODE.
God produced all things by His Intellect and Will and free Determination. He willed to produce them by the mediation of His Sephiroth, and Persons by which He is enabled most perfectly to manifest
Himself and that the more perfectly, by producing the causes themselves, and the Causes of Causes, and not merely the viler effects.
God produced, in the first Originate, all the remaining causates. For, as He Himself is most simply One
and from One Simple Being One only can immediately proceed, hence it results that from the First Supreme Infinite Unity flowed forth at the same time All and One. One, that is in so far as flowing
from the Most Simple Unity, and being like unto It; but also All, in so far as, departing from that perfect Singleness which can be measured by no other Singleness, it became, to a certain extent, manifold,
thougll still Absolute and Perfect.
Emanation, says the same, is the Resulting displayed from the Unresulting, the Finite from the Infinite, the Manifold and Composite from the Perfect Single and Simple, Potentiality from that which is Infinite
Power and Act, the mobile from that which is perennially permanent and therefore in a more imperfect and diminished mode than His Infinite Perfection is. As the First Cause is all things, in an unresulting
and Infinite mode, so the Entities that flow from Him are the First Causes, in a resulting and finite mode.
THE NECESSARY ENTITY, subsisting of Itself, as It cannot be dissevered into the manifold, yet
becomes, as it were, multiplied in the Causates, in respect of their Nature, or of the Subsistences, Vessels and openings assigned to them; whereby the Single and Infinite Essence, being inclosed or
comprehended in these limits, bounds, or externalnesses, takes on Itself Definiteness of dimension and becomes Itself manifold, by the manifoldness of these envelopes.
As man [the unit of Humanity] is a microcosm, so Adam Kadmon is a macrocosm, containing all the
Causates of the First Cause as the Material Man is the end and completion of all creation, so in the Divine Man is the beginning thereof. As the inferior Adam receives all things from all, so the superior

561/641
Adam supplies all things to all. As the former is the principle of reflected light, so the latter is of Direct Light. The former is the terminus of the Light, descending; the latter its terminus, ascending. As the
Inferior man ascends from the lowest matter even to the First Cause, so the Superior Adam descends from the Simple and Infinite Act, even to the lowest and most attenuated Potence.
The Ternary is the bringing back of duality to unity.
The Ternary is the Principle of Number, because bringing back the binary to unity, it restores to it the
same quantity whereby it had departed from unity. It is the first odd number, containing in itself the first even number and the unit, which are the Father and Mother of all Numbers; and it has in itself the
beginning, middle and end.
Now, Adam Kadmon emanated from the Absolute Unity and so is himself a unit. But he also descends and flows downward into his own Nature and so is duality. Again, he returns to the Unity, which he hath
in himself, and to The Highest, and so is the Ternary and Quaternary.
And this is why the Essential Name has four letters, three different ones, and one of them once repeated; since the first He is the wife of the Yod, and the second He is the wife of the Vav.
Those media which manifest the First Cause, in Himself profoundly hidden, are the Sephiroth, which
emanate immediately from that First cause and by Its Nature have produced and do control all the rest.
These Sephiroth were put forth from the One First and Simple, manifesting His Infinite Goodness. They are the mirrors of His Truth and the analogues of His Supremest Essence, the Ideas of His Wisdom and
the representations of His will; the receptacles of His Potency, and the
instruments with which He operates; the Treasury of His Felicity, the dispensers of His Benignity, the
Judges of His Kingdom and reveal His Law and finally, the Denominations, Attributes, and Names of Him Who is above all and the Cause of all the ten categories, wherein all things are contained; the
universal genera, which in themselves include all things and utter them outwardly the Second Causes, whereby the First Cause effects, preserves and governs all things; the rays of the Divinity, whereby all
things are illumined and manifested; the Forms and Ideas and species, out whereof all things issue forth; the Souls and Potencies, whereby essence, life, and movement are given to all things; the
Standard of times, whereby all things are measured; the incorporeal Spaces which, in themselves, hold and inclose the Universe; the Supernal Monads to which all manifolds are referred, and through them to
The One and Simple and finally the Formal Perfections, flowing, forth from and still connected with the One Eminent Limitless Perfection, are the Causes of all dependent Perfections, and so illuminate
the elementary Intelligences, not adjoined to matter, and the intellectual Souls, and the Celestial,

Elemental and Elementproduced bodies.
The IDRA SUTA says:
He the Most Holy Hidden Eldest, separates Himself and is ever more and more separated from all that are; nor yet does He in very deed separate Himself; because all things cohere with Him and HE with
All. HE is All that is, the Most Holy Eldest of All, the Occult by all possible occultations.
When HE takes shape, HE produces nine Lights, which shine forth from Him, from His outforming. And those Lights outshine from Him and emit flames, and go forth and spread out on every side; as
from one elevated Lamp the Rays are poured forth in every direction and these Rays thus diverging, are found to be, when one approaching has cognizance of them, but a single Lamp.
The Space in which to create is fixed by THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT and illuminated by His
inflowing, which is the Light of Wisdom and the Beginning from which manifestation flows.
And HE is conformed in three Heads, which are but one Head and these three are extended into Microprosopos and from them shines out all that is.
Then this Wisdom instituted investiture with form, whereby the unmanifested and informous became
manifested, putting on form and produced a certain outflow.
When this Wisdom is thus expanded by flowing forth, then it is called "Father of Fathers" the whole Universe of Things being contained and comprehended in it. This Wisdom is the principle of all things
and in it beginning and end are found.
The Book of the Abstruse, says the Siphra de Zeniutha, is that which describes the equilibrium of the Balance. Before the Balance was, face did not look toward face.
And the Commentary on it says: The Scales of the Balance are designated as Male and Female. In the
Spiritual world Evil and Good are in equilibrio, and it will be restored, when of the Evil Good becomes, until all is Good. Also this other world is called the World of the Balance. For, as in the Balance are two
scales, one on either side and the beam and needle between them, so too in this world of restoration, the Numerations are arranged as distinct persons. For Hakemah is on the right hand, on the side of
Gedulah, and Binah on the left, on the side of Geburah and Kether is the beam of the Balance above

them in the middle. So Gedulah or Khased is on one hand, and Geburah on the other, and under these Tephareth and Netsach is on one side and Hod on the other and under these Yesod.
The Supreme Crown, which is the Ancient Most Holy, the most Hidden of the Hidden, is fashioned,
within the occult Wisdom, of both sexes, Male and Female.
Bakemah and Binah, the Mother, whom it impregnates, are quantitatively equal. Wisdom and the Mother of Intellection go forth at once and dwell together; for when the Intellectual Power emanates,
the productive Source of intellection is included in Him.
Before Adam Kadmon was fashioned into Male and Female and the state of equilibrium introduced, the Father and Mother did not look each other in the face; for the Father denotes most perfect Love and the
Mother most perfect Rigor and she averted her face.
There is no left [female], says the Idra Rabba, in the Ancient and Hidden One; but His totality is Right [male]. The totality of things is HUA, HE and HE is hidden on every side.
Macroprosopos [Adam Kadmon] is not so near unto us as to speak to us in the first person; but is
designated in the third person, HUA, HE.
Of the letters it says:
Yod is male, He is female, Vav is both.
In Yod are three Yods, the upper and the lower apex and Vav in the middle. By the upper apex is denoted the Supreme Kether; by Vav in the middle, Hakemah and by the lower apex, Binah.
The IDRA SUTA says:
The Universe was outformed in the form of Male and Female. Wisdom, pregnant with all that is, when
it flowed and shone forth, shone altogether under the form of male and female. Hakemah is the Father and Binah is the Mother and so the two are in equilibrium as male and female and for this reason, all
things whatsoever are constituted in the form of
male and female and if it were not so they would not exist.

This Principle, Hakemah, is the Generator of all things and He and Binah conjoin and she shines within
Him. When they thus conjoin, she conceives and the outflow is Truth.
Yod impregnates the letter He and begets a son and she, thus pregnant, brings forth. The Principle called Father [the Male or Generative Principle] is comprehended in Yod, which itself flows downward
from the energy of the Absolute Holy One.
Yod is the beginning and the end of all things that are. The stream that flows forth is the Universe of things, which always becomes having no cessation. And this becoming world is created by Yod; for Yod
includes two letters. All things are included in Yod wherefore it is called the Father of all.
All Categories whatever go forth from Hakemah and in it are contained all things, unmanifested; and the aggregate of all things, or the Unity in which the many are, and out of which all flow, is the Sacred
Name IHUH.
In the view of the Kabalists, all individuals are contained in species, and all species in genera, and all particulars in a Universal, which is an idea, abstracted from all consideration of individuals; not an
aggregate of individuals; but, as it were, an Ens, Entity or Being, ideal or
intellectual, but none the less real; prior to any individual, containing them all, and out of which they
are all in succession evolved.
If this discontents you, reflect that, supposing the theory correct, that all was originally in the Deity, and that the Universe has proceeded forth from Him, and not been created by Him out of nothing, the
idea of the Universe, existing in the Deity before its outflow, must have been as
real as the Deity Himself. The whole Human race, or Humanity, for example, then existed in the Deity,
not distinguished into individuals, but as a Unit, out of which the Manifold was to flow.
Everything actual must also first have been possible, before having actual existence; and this possibility or potentiality was to the Kabalists a real Ens. Before the evolvement of the Universe, it had to exist
potentially, the whole of it, with all its individuals, included in a
single Unity. This was the Idea or Plan of the Universe and this had to be formed. It had to emanate
from the Infinite Deity, and be of Himself, though not His Very Self.

Tephareth, Harmony and Beauty, is also called in the Kabalah "Judgment," in which term are included the ideas of limitation and conditioning, which often seems, indeed, to be its principal sense; while
Benignity is as often styled Infinite. Thus it is obscurely taught that in everything that is, not only the Finite but also the Infinite is present and that the rigor of the stern law of limitation, by which
everything below or beside the Infinite Absolute is limited, bounded, and
conditioned, is tempered and modified by the grace, which so relaxes it that the Infinite, Unlimited,
Unconditioned, is also everywhere present and that it is thus the Spiritual and Material Natures are in equilibrio, Good everywhere counterbalancing Evil, Light everywhere in equilibrium with Darkness;
from which again results the Universal Harmony of things.
In the vacant space effected for creation, there at last remained a faint vestige or trace of Ainsophic Light, of the Light of the Substance of the Infinite. Man is thus both human and divine: and the
apparent antagonisms in his Nature are a real equilibrium, if he wills it shall be so; from which results the Harmony, not only of Life and Action, but of Virtue and Perfection.
To understand the Kabalistic idea of the Sephiroth, it must be borne in mind that they were assigned,
not only to the world of Emanation, Aziluth, but also to each of the other worlds, Briah, Jezirah, and Asiah. They were not only attributes of the Unmanifested Deity, not only Himself in limitation, but His
actual manifestations, or His qualities made apparent as modes; and they were also qualities of the Universal Nature Spiritual, Mental, and Material, produced and made existent by the outflow of
Himself.
In the view of the Kabalah, God and the Universe were One and in the One General, as the type or source, were included and involved and from it have been evolved and issued forth, the manifold and all
particulars. Where, indeed, does individuality begin? Is it the Hidden Source and Spring alone that is the individual, the Unit, or is it the flowing fountain that fills the ocean, or the ocean itself, or its waves,
or the drops, or the vaporous particles, that are the individuals? The Sea and the River these are each One; but the drops of each are many. The tree is one; but its leaves are a multitude: they drop with the
frosts, and fall upon his roots; but the tree still continues to grow and new leaves come again in the Spring. Is the Human Race not the Tree, and are not individual men the leaves? How else explain the
force of will and sympathy, and the dependence of one man at every instant of his life on others, except by the oneness of the race? The links that bind all created things together are the links of a single Unity,
and the whole Universe is One, developing itself into the manifold.
Obtuse commentators have said that the Kabalah assigns sexual characteristics to the very Deity. There is no warrant for such an assertion, anywhere in the Sohar or in any commentary upon it. On the
contrary, the whole doctrine of the Kabalah is based on the fundamental proposition, that the Very Deity is Infinite, everywhere extended, without limitation or determination, and therefore without any
conformation whatever. In order to commence the process of creation, it was necessary for Him, first of

all, to effect a vacant space within Himself. To this end the Deity, whose Nature is approximately expressed by describing Him as Light filling all space, formless, limitless, contracts Himself on all
sides from a point within Himself and thus effects a quasivacant space, in which only a vestige of His Light remains and into this circular or spherical space He immits His Emanations, portions of His Light
or Nature; and to some of these, sexual characteristics are symbolically assigned.
The Infinite first limits Himself by flowing forth in the shape of Will, of determination to act. This Will of the Deity, or the Deity as will, is Kether, or the Crown, the first Sephirah. In it are included all other
Emanations. This is a philosophical necessity. The Infinite does not first will, and then, as a sequence to, or consequence of, that determination, subsequently perform. To will and to act must be with Him,
not only simultaneous, but in reality the same. Nor does He, by His Omniscience, learn that a particular action will be wise and then, in consequence of being so convinced, first determine to do the act, and
then do it. His Wisdom and His Will, also, act simultaneously and with Him, to decide that it was wise to create, was to create. Thus His will contains in itself all the Sephiroth. This will, determining Him to
the exercise of intellection, to thought, to frame the Idea of the Universe, caused the Power in Him to excite the intellectual Faculty to exercise, and was that Power. Its SELF, which had flowed forth from
Ainsoph as Will, now flows forth as the Generative Power to beget intellectual action in the Intellectual Faculty, or Intelligence, Binah. The Act itself, the Thought, the Intellection, producing the Idea, is
Daath; and as the text of the Siphra de Zeniutha says, The Power and Faculty, the Generative and Productive, the Active and Passive, the Will and Capacity, which unite to produce that Act of reflection
or Thought or Intellection, are always in conjunction. As is elsewhere said in the Kabalah, both of them are contained and essentially involved in the result. And the Will, as Wisdom or Intellectual Power and
the Capacity or Faculty are really the Father and Mother of all that is. For to the creation of anything, it was absolutely necessary that The Infinite should form for Himself and in Himself, an idea of what HE
willed to produce or create. As there is no Time with Him, to will was to create, to plan was to Will and to create; and in the Idea, the Universe in potence, the universal succession of things was included.
Thenceforward all was merely evolution and development.
Netsach and Hod, the Seventh and Eighth Sephiroth, are usually called in the Kabalah, Victory and Glory. Netsach is the perfect Success, which with the Deity to Whom the Future is present, attends, and
to His creatures is to result, from the plan of Equilibrium everywhere adopted by Him. It is the reconciliation of Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, Freewill and Necessity, God's omnipotence and
Man's liberty and the harmonious issue and result of all, without which the Universe would be a failure. It is the inherent Perfection of the Deity, manifested in His Idea of the Universe, and in all the
departments or worlds, spiritual, mental, or material, of that Universe; but it is that Perfection regarded as the successful result, which it both causes or produces and is, the perfection of the plan being its
success. It is the prevailing of Wisdom over Accident; and it, in turn, both produces and is the Glory and Laudation of the Great Infinite Contriver, whose plan is thus Successful and Victorious.
From these two, which are one, from the excellence and perfection of the Divine Nature and Wisdom,

considered as Success and Glory, as the opposites of Failure and Mortification, results what the Kabalah, styling it Yesod, Foundation or Basis, characterizes as the Generative member of the
Symbolical human figure by which the ten Sephiroth are represented and from this flows Malakoth, Empire, Dominion, or Rule. Yesod is the Stability and Permanence, which would, in ordinary language,
be said to result from the perfection of the Idea or Intellectual Universal, out of which all particulars are evolved; from the success of that scheme and the consequent Glory or SelfSatisfaction of the Deity;
but which Stability and Permanence that Perfection, Success and Glory really Is; since the Deity, infinitely Wise, and to Whom the Past, Present and Future were and always will be one Now, and all
space one HERE, had not to await the operation and evolution of His plan, as men do the result of an experiment, in order to see if it would succeed, and so to determine whether it should stand and be
stable and permanent, or fall and be temporary. Its Perfection was its Success; His Glory, its permanence and stability and the Attributes of Permanence and Stability belong, like the others, to the
Universe, material, mental, spiritual,and real, becalise and as they belong to the Infinite Himself.
This Stability and Permanence causes continuance and generates succession. It is Perpetuity, and continuity without solution and by this continuous succession, whereby out of Death comes new Life,
out of dissolution and resolution comes reconstruction. Necessity and Fatality result as a consequence; that is to say, the absolute control and dominion (Malakoth) of The Infinite Deity over all that He
produces and over chance and accident and the absolute nonexistence in the Universe, in Time and in Space, of any other powers or influences than those which, proceeding from Him, are and cannot not be
perfectly submissive to His will. This results, humanly speaking; but in reality, the Perfection of the plan, which is its success, His glory, and its stability, is also His Absolute Autocracy, and the utter
absence of Chance, Accident, or Antagonism. And, as the Infinite Wisdom or Absolute Reason rules in the Divine Nature itself, so also it does in its Emanations and in the worlds or systems of Spirit, Soul,
and Matter; in each of which there is as little Chance or Accident or Unreasoning Fate, as in the Divine Nature unmanifested.
This is the Kabalistic theory as to each of the four worlds; 1st of the Divine Nature, or Divinity itself,
quantitatively limited and determined, but not manifested into Entities, which is the world of Emanation, 2nd of the first Entities, that is of Spirits and Angels, which is the world of creation; 3rd of
the first forms, souls, or psychical natures, which is the world of Formation or Fashioning and 4th of Matter and Bodies, which is the world of Fabrication, or as it were, of manufacture. In each of these the
Deity is present, as in and through the Ten Sephiroth. First of these, in each, is Kether, the Crown, ring, or circlet, the HEAD. Next, in that Head, as the two Hemispheres of the Brain, are Hakemah and Binah
and their result and progeny, Daath.
These three are found also in the Spiritual world and are universals in the psychical and material world, producing the lower Sephiroth. Then follow, in perfect Equilibrium, Law and Equity, Justice and Mercy,
the Divine Infinite Nature and the Human Finite Nature, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, Benignity and Severity, the Male and the Female again, as Hakemah and Binah are, mutually tempering each

other, and by their intimate union producing the other Sephiroth.
The whole Universe, and all the succession of entities and events were present to The Infinite, before any act of creation and His Benignity and Leniency, tempering and qualifying the law of rigorous
Justice and inflexible Retribution, enabled Him to create. Because but for it and if He could not but have administered the strict and stern law of justice, that would have compelled Him to destroy,
immediately after its inception, the Universe He purposed to create, and so would have prevented its creation. This Leniency, therefore was as it were, the very essence and quintessence of the Permanence
and Stability of the plan of Creation and part of the Very Nature of the Deity. The Kabalah, therefore, designates it as Light and Whiteness, by which the Very Substance of Deity is symbolized. With this
agree Paul's ideas as to Law and Grace; for Paul had studied the Kabalah at the feet of Gamaliel the Rabbi.
With this Benignity, the Autocracy of the dominion and control of the Deity is imbued and
interpenetrated. The former, poured, as it were, into the latter, is an integral and essential part of it and causes it to give birth to the succession and continuance of the Universe. For Malakoth, in the Kabalah,
is female and the matrix or womb out of which all creation is born.
The Sephiroth may be arranged as on page 770.
The Kabalah is the primitive tradition and its entirety rests on the single dogma of Magism, "the visible is for us the proportional measure of the invisible". The Ancients, observing that equilibrium is in
physics the universal law, and that it results from the apparent opposition of two forces, concluded from the physical to the metaphysical equilibrium and thought that in God, that is to say, in the first living
and active cause, two properties necessary to each other, should be recognized; stability and movement, necessity and liberty, order dictated by reason and the selfrule of Supreme Will, Justice, and Love and
consequently Severity and Grace, Mercy or Benignity.
The idea of equilibrium among all the impersonations; of the male on one side and the female on the other, with the Supreme Will, which is also the Absolute Reason, above each two, holding the balance,
is, according to the Kabalah, the foundation of all religions and all sciences, the primary and immutable idea of things. The Sephiroth are a triple triangle and a circle, the idea of the Ternary explained by the
balance and multiplied by itself in the Supremacy and absolute control of the Divine Will in all things, domain of the Ideal; then the realization of this Idea in forms.
Unity can only be manifested by the Binary. Unity itself and the idea of Unity are already two.

The human unity is made complete by the right and left. The primitive man was of both sexes.
The Divinity, one in its essence, has two essential conditions as fundanlental bases of its existence Necessity and Liberty.
The laws of the Supreme Reason necessitate and regulate liberty in God, Who is necessarily reasonable
and wise.
Knowledge supposes the binary. An object known is indispensable to the being that knows.
The binary is the generator of Society and the law. It is also the number of the gnosis, a word adopted in lieu of Science, and expressing only the idea of cognizance by intuition. It is Unity, multiplying itself
by itself to create and therefore it is that the Sacred Symbols make Eve issue from the very chest of Adam.
Adam is the human Tetragram, which is summed up in the mysterious Yod of the Kabalah, image of the
Kabalistic Phallus. Add to this Yod, the ternary name of Eve, and you form the name of Jehova, the Divine Tetragram, the transcendent Kabalistic and magical word.
Thus it is that Unity, complete in the fecundity of the Ternary forms with it the Quaternary, which is the
key of all numbers, movements and forms.
The Square, turning upon itself produces the circle equal to itself and the circular movement of four equal angles turning around one point, is the quadrature of the circle.
The Binary serves as a measure for Unity and the relation of equality between the Above and the
Below, forms with them the Ternary.
To us, Creation is Mechanism to the Ancients it was Generation. The worldproducing egg figures in all cosmogonies and modern science has discovered that all animal production is oviparous. From this idea
of generation came the reverence everywhere paid the image of generative power, which formed the Stauros of the Gnostics, and the philosophical Cross of the Masons.

Passive. Unity is Boaz and the Binary is Jachin.
The two columns, Boaz and Jachin, explain in the Kabalah all the mysteries of natural, political, and religious antagonism.
Woman is man's creation and universal creation is the female of the First Principle. When the Principle
of Existence made Himself Creator, He produced by emanation an ideal Yod and to make room for it in the plenitude of the uncreated Light, He had to hollow out a pit of shadow, equal to the dimension
determined by His creative desire and attributed by Him to the ideal Yod of radiating Light.
The nature of the Active Principle is to diffuse of the Passive Principle, to collect and make fruitful.
Creation is the habitation of the CreatorWord. To create, the Generative Power and Productive Capacity must unite, the Binary become Unity again by the conjunction. The WORD is the First
BEGOTTEN, not the first created Son of God.
SANCTA SANCTIS, we repeat again; the Holy things to the Holy and to him who is so, the mysteries of the Kabalah will be holy. Seek and ye shall find, say the Scriptures; knock and it shall be opened
unto you. If you desire to find and to gain admission to the Sanctuary, we have said enough to show you the way. If you do not, it is useless for us to say more, as it has been useless to say so much.
The Hermetic philosophers also drew their doctrines from the Kabalah and more particularly from the
Treatise Beth Alohim or Domus Dei, known as the Pneumatica Kabalistica, of Rabbi Abraham Cohen Irira, and the Treatise De Revolutionibus Animarum of Rabbi Jitzchak Lorja.
This philosophy was concealed by the Alchemists under their Symbols and in the jargon of a rude
Chemistry, a jargon incomprehensible and absurd except to the Initiates; but the key to which is within your reach and the philosophy, it may be, worth studying. The labors of the human
intellect are always interesting and instructive.
To be always rich, always young and never to die; such has been in all times the dream of the Alchemists.
To change into gold, lead, mercury and all the other metals; to possess the universal medicine and elixir
of life; such is the problem to be resolved, in order to accomplish this desire and realize this dream.

Like all the Mysteries of Magism, the Secrets of "the Great Work" have a threefold signification: they
are religious, philosophical and natural.
The philosophal gold in religion is the Absolute and Supreme Reason in philosophy. It is the Truth; in visible nature, the Sun; in the subterranean and mineral world, the most perfect and pure gold.
It is for this that the pursuit of the Great Work is called the Search for the Absolute and the work itself,
the work of the Sun.
All the masters of the Science admit that it is impossible to attain the material results, unless there are found in the two higher Degrees all the analogies of the universal medicine and of the philosophal
stone.
Then, they say, the work is simple, easy and inexpensive; otherwise it consumes fruitlessly the fortune and lives of the seekers.
The universal medicine for the Soul is the Supreme Reason and Absolute Justice; for the mind,
mathematical and practical Truth; for the body, the Quintessence, a combination of light and gold.
The prima materia of the Great Work in the Superior World is enthusiasm and activity; in the intermediate world, intelligence and industry; in the lower world, labor and in Science; it is the Sulphur,
Mercury and Salt, which by turns volatilized and fixed, compose the AZOTH of the Sages.
The Sulphur corresponds with the elementary form of the Fire Mercury with the Air and Water and Salt with the Earth.
The Great Work is, above all things, the creation of man by himself; that is to say, the full and entire
conquest which he effects of his faculties and his future. It is, above all, the perfect emancipation of his will, which assures him the universal empire of Azoth, and the domain of magnetism, that is complete
power over the universal Magical agent.
This Magical agent which the Ancient Hermetic philosophers disguised under the name of "Prima Materia," determines the forms of the modifiable Substance; and the Alchemists said that by means of
it they could attain the transmutation of metals and the universal medicine.

There are two Hermetic operations, one spiritual and the other material; dependent the one on the other.
The whole Hermetic Science is contained in the dogma of Hermes, engraven originally, it is said, on a
tablet of emerald. Its sentences that relate to operating the Great Work are as follows:
"Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross gently with much industry.
"It ascends from earth to Heaven and again descends to earth and receives the force of things above and below.
"Thou shalt by this means possess the glory of the whole world and therefore all obscurity shall flee
away from thee.
"This is the potent force of all force, for it will overcome everything subtile and penetrate everything solid.
"So the world was created."
All the Masters in Alchemy who have written of the Great Work, have employed symbolic and
figurative expressions; being constrained to do so, as well to repel the profane from a work that would be dangerous for them, as to be well understood by Adepts, in revealing to them the whole world of
analogies governed by the single and sovereigr dogma of Hermes.
So in their language, gold and silver are the King and Queen, or the Sun and Moon; Sulphur, the flying Eagle; Mercury, the Manwoman winged, bearded, mounted on a cube, and crowned with flames;
Matter or Salt, the winged Dragon; the Metals in ebullition, Lions of different colors and, finally, the entire work has for its symbols the Pelican and the Phoenix.
The Hermetic Art is therefore, at the same time a religion, a philosophy, and a natural science. As a
religion, it is that of the Ancient Magi and the Initiates of all ages; as a philosophy, we may find its principles in the school of Alexandria and the theories of Pythagoras; as a science, we must inquire for
its processes of Paracelsus, Nicholas Flamel, and Raymond Lulle.

The Science is a real one only for those who admit and understand the philosophy and the religion. Its process will succeed only for the Adept who has attained the sovereignty of will and so become the
King of the elementary world. For the grand agent of the operation of the Sun, is that force described in the Symbol of Hermes, of the table of emerald; it is the universal magical power; the spiritual, fiery,
motive power; it is the Od, according to the Hebrews, and the Astral light, according to others.
Therein is the secret fire; living and philosophical, of which all the Hermetic philosophers speak with the most mysterious reserve. The Universal Seed; the secret whereof they kept and which they
represented only under the figure of the Caduceus of Hermes.
This is the grand Hermetic arcanum. What the Adepts call dead matter are bodies as found in nature; living matters are substances assimilated and magnetized by the science and will of the operator.
So that the Great Work is more than a chemical operation; it is a real creation of the human word
initiated into the power of the Word of God.
The creation of gold in the Great Work is effected by transmutation and multiplication.
Raymond Lulle says, that to make gold, one must have gold and mercury; and to make silver, silver and mercury. And he adds: "I mean by mercury, that mineral spirit so fine and pure that it gilds even the
seed of gold, and silvers that of silver." He meant by this, either electricity, or Od, the astral light.
The Salt and Sulphur serve in the work only to prepare the mercury and it is to the mercury especially that we must assimilate and as it were, incorporate with it the magnetic agent. Paracelsus, Lulle, and
Flamel alone seem to have perfectly known this mystery.
The Great Work of Hermes is therefore, an operation essentially magical, and the highest of all, for it supposes the Absolute in Science and in Will. There is light in gold, gold in light, and light in all
things.
The disciples of Hermes, before promising their adepts the elixir of long life or the powder of projection, advised them to seek for the Philosophal Stone.
The Ancients adored the Sun, under the form of a black Stone, called Elagabalus, or Heliogabalus. The
faithful are promised, in the Apocalypse, a white Stone.

This Stone, says the Masters in Alchemy, is the true Salt of the philosophers, which enters as onethird
into the composition of Azoth. But Azoth is, as we know, the name of the grand Hermetic Agent and the true philosophical Agent; wherefore they represent their Salt under the form of a cubical Stone.
The Philosophical Stone is the foundation of the Absolute philosophy, the Supreme and unalterable
Reason. Before thinking of the Metallic work, we must be firmly fixed on the Absolute principles of Wisdom; we must be in possession of this Reason, which is the touchstone of Truth. A man who is the
slave of preiudices will never become the King of Nature and the Master of transmutations. The Philosophal Stone, therefore, is necessary above all things. How shall it be found? Hermes tells us, in
his "Table of Emerald," we must separate the subtile from the fixed, with great care and extreme attention. So we ought to separate our certainties from our beliefs, and make perfectly distinct the
respective domains of science and faith and to comprehend that we do not know the things we believe, nor believe anything that we come to know and that thus the essence of the things of Faith are the
unknown and indefinite, while it is precisely the contrary with the things of Science. Whence we shall conclude, that Science rests on reason and experience and Faith has for its bases sentiment and reason.
The Sun and Moon of the Alchemists concur in perfecting and giving stability to the Philosophal Stone.
They correspond to the two columns of the Temple, Jachin and Boaz. The Sun is the hieroglyphical sign of Truth, because it is the source of Light; and the rough Stone is the symbol of Stability. Hence
the Mediaeval Alchemists indicated the Philosophal Stone as the first means of making the philosophical gold, that is to say, of transforming all the vital powers figured by the six metals into Sun,
that is, into Truth and Light; which is the first and indispensable operation of the Great Work, which leads to the secondary adaptation, and enables the creators of the spiritual and living gold, the
possessors of the true philosophical Salt, Mercury, and Sulphur, to discover, by the analogies of Nature, the natural and palpable gold.
To find the Philosophical Stone, is to have discovered the Absolute, as all the Masters say. But the
Absolute is that which admits of no errors, is the Fixed from the Volatile, is the Law of the Imagination, is the very necessity of Being, is the immutable Law of Reason and Truth. The Absolute is that which
IS.
To find the Absolute in the Infinite, in the Indefinite and in the Finite, this is the Magnum Opus, the Great Work of the Sages, which Hermes called the Work of the Sun.
To find the immovable bases of true religious Faith, of Philosophical Truth, and of Metallic
transmutation, this is the secret of Hermes in its entirety, the Philosophal Stone.

This stone is one and manifold; it is decomposed by Analysis and recompounded by Synthesis. In Analysis, it is a powder, the powder of projection of the Alchemists; before Analysis, and in Synthesis,
it is a stone.
The Philosophal Stone, say the Masters, must not be exposed to the atmosphere, nor to the gaze of the Profane; but it must be kept concealed and carefully preserved in the most secret place of the laboratory
and the possessor must always carry on his person the key of the place where it is kept.
He who possesses the Grand Arcanum is a genuine King and more than a king, for he is inaccessible to all fear and all empty hopes. In all maladies of soul and body, a single particle from the precious stone,
a single grain of the divine powder, is more than sufficient to cure him. "Let him hear, who hath ears to hear!" the Master said.
The Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury are but the accessorial elements and passive instruments of the Great
Work. All depends, as we have said, on the internal Magnet of Paracelsus. The entire work consists in projection and the projection is perfectly accomplished by the effective and realizable understanding of
a single word.
There is but a single important operation in the work; this consists in Sublimation, which is nothing else, according to Geber than the elevation of dry matter, by means of fire, with adhesion to its proper
vessel.
He who desires to attain to the understanding of the Grand Word and the possession of the Great Secret, ought carefully to read the Hermetic philosophers and will undoubtedly attain initiation, as others have
done; but he must take, for the key of their allegories, the single dogma of Hermes, contained in his table of Emerald, and follow, to class his acquisitions of knowledge and direct the operation, the order
indicated in the Kabalistic alphabet of the Tarot.
Raymond Lulle has said that to make gold, we must first have gold. Nothing is made out of nothing; we do not absolutely create wealth; we increase and multiply it. Let aspirants to science well understand
then, that neither the juggler's tricks nor miracles are to be asked of the adept. The Hermetic science, like all the real sciences, is mathematically demonstrable. Its results, even material, are as rigorous as
that of a correct equation.
The Hermetic Gold is not only a true dogma, a light without Shadow, a Truth without alloy of falsehood. It is also a material; gold, real, pure, the most precious that can be found in the mines of the
earth.

But the living gold, the living sulphur, or the true fire of the philosophers, is to be sought for in the
house of Mercury. This fire is fed by the air: to express its attractive and expansive power, no better comparison can be used than that of the lightning, which is at first only a dry and earthly exhalation,
united to the moist vapor, but which, by selfexhalation, takes a fiery nature, acts on the humidity inherent in it, which it attracts to itself and transmutes in its nature; after which it precipitates itself
rapidly toward the earth, whither it is attracted by a fixed nature like unto its own.
These words, in form enigmatic, but clear at bottom, distinctly express what the philosophers mean by their Mercury, fecundated by Sulphur and which becomes the Master and regenerator of the Salt. It is
the AZORTH, the universal magnetic force, the grand magical agent, the Astral light, the light of life, fecundated by the mental force, the intellectual energy, which they compare to sulphur, on account of its
amnities with the Divine fire.
As to the Salt, it is Absolute Matter. Whatever is matter contains salt and all salt [nitre] may be converted into pure gold by the combined action of Sulphur and Mercury, which sometimes act so
rapidly, that the transmutation may be effected in an instant, in an hour, without fatigue to the operator, and almost without expense. At other times, and according to the more refractory temper of the
atmospheric media, the operation requires several days, several months, and sometimes even several years.
Two primary laws exist in nature; two essential laws which produce by counterbalancing each other, the
universal equilibrium of things. These are fixedness and movement, analogous, in philosophy, to Truth and Fiction and in Absolute Conception, to Necessity and Liberty, which are the very essence of Deity.
The Hermetic philosophers gave the name fixed to everything ponderable, to everything that tends by its natural to central repose and immobility; they term volatile everything that more naturally and more
readily obeys the law of movement and they form their stone by analysis, that is to say by the volatilization of the Fixed and then by synthesis, that is by fixing the volatile, which they effect by
applying to the fixed, which they call their salt, the sulphurated Mercury, or the light of life directed and made omnipotent by a Sovereign Will. Thus they master entire Nature and their stone is found wherever
there is salt, which is the reason for saying that no substance is foreign to the Great Work, and that even the most despicable and apparently vile matters may be changed into gold, which is true in this sense,
that they all contain the original saltprinciple, represented in our emblems by the cubical stone.
To know how to extract from all matter the pure salt concealed in it, is to have the Secret of the Stone. Wherefore this is a Saline stone, which the Od or universal astral light decomposes or recompounds: it
is single and manifold; for it may be dissolved like ordinary salt and incorporated with other substances. Obtained by analysis, we might term it the Universal Sublimate: found by way of synthesis, it is the true
panacea of the ancients, for it cures all maladies of soul and body, and has been styled, parexcellence,

the medicine of all nature. When one, by absolute initiation, comes to control the forces of the universal agent, he always has this stone at his disposal, for its extraction is then a simple and easy operation,
very distinct from the metallic projection or realization. This stone, when in a state of sublimation, must not be exposed to contact with the atmospheric air, which might partially dissolve it and deprive it of its
virtue; nor could its emanations be inhaled without danger. The Sage prefers to preserve it in its natural envelopes, assured as he is of extracting it by a single effort of his will, and a single application of the
Universal Agent to the envelopes, which the Kabalists call cortices, the shells, bark or integuments.
Hieroglyphically to express this law of prudence, they gave their Mercury, personified in Egypt as Hermanubis, a dog's head and to their Sulphur, represented by the Baphomet of the Temp!e, that goat's
head which brought into such disrepute the occult Mediaeval associations.
Let us listen for a few moments to the Alchemists themselves and endeavor to learn the hidden meaning of their mysterious words.
The RITUAL of the Degree of Scottish Elder MASTER and Knight of Saint Andrew, being the fourth
Degree of Ramsay, it is said upon the titlepage, or of the Reformed or Rectified Rite of Dresden, has these passages:
"O how great and glorious is the presence of the Almighty God which gloriously shines from between
the Cherubim!
"How adorable and astonishing are the rays of that glorious Light, that sends forth its bright and brilliant beams from the Holy Ark of Alliance and Covenant!
"Let us with the deepest veneration and devotion adore the great Source of Life, that Glorious Spirit
Who is the Most Merciful and Beneficent Ruler of the Universe and of all the creatures it contains"!

know that all matter and all material substances are composed of combinations of three several substances, extracted from the four elements, which three substances in combination are, Salt, Sulphur
and Spirit. The first of these produces Solidity, the second Softness, and the third the Spiritual, vaporous particles. These three compound substances work potently together and therein consists the
true process for the transmutation of metals".

"To these three substances allude the three golden basins, in the first of which was engraved the letter M.'., in the second, the letter G.'., and in the third nothing. The first, M.'., is the initial letter of the
Hebrew word Malakh, which signifies Salt and the second, G.'., of the Hebrew word Geparaith, which signifies Sulphur; and as there is no word in Hebrew to express the vaporous and intangible Spirit, there
is no letter in the third basin".
"With these three principal substances you may effect the transmutation of metals, which must be done by means of the five points or rules of the Scottish Mastership".
"The first Master's point shows us the Brazen Sea, wherein must always be rainwater and out of this
rainwater the Scottish Masters extract the first substance, which is Salt; which salt must afterward undergo a sevenfold manipulation and purification, before it will be properly prepared. This sevenfold
purification is symbolized by the Seven Steps of Solomon's Temple, which symbol is furnished us by the first point or rule of the Scottish Masters".
"After preparing the first substance, you are to extract the second, Sulphur, out of the purest gold, to
which must then be added the purified or celestial Salt. They are to be mixed as the Art directs and then placed in a vessel in the form of a SHIP, in which it is to remain, as the Ark of Noah was afloat, one
hundred and fifty days, being brought to the first damp, warm degree of fire, that it may putrefy and produce the mineral fermentation This is the second point or rule of the Scottish Masters."
If you reflect my Brother, that it was impossible for any one to imagine that either common salt or nitre
could be extracted from rainwater, or sulphur from pure gold, you will no doubt suspect that some secret meaning was concealed in these words.
The Kabalah considers the immaterial part of man as threefold, consisting of NEPHESCH, RUACH,
and NESCHAMAH, Psyche, Spiritus, and Mens, or Soul, Spirit, and Intellect. There are Seven Holy Palaces, Seven Heavens and Seven Thrones; and Souls are purified by ascending through Seven
Spheres. A Ship, in Hebrew, is Ani; and the same word means I, Me, or Myself.
The RITUAL, continues:
"Multiplying the substance thus obtained, is the third operation, which is done by adding to them the animate, volatile Spirit which is done by means of the water of the Celestial Salt, as well as by the Salt,
which must daily be added to it very carefully and strictly observing to put neither too much nor too little; inasmuch as, if you add too much, you will destroy that growing and multiplying substance and if
too little, it will be selfconsumed and destroyed and shrink away, not having sumcient substantiality for

its preservation. This third point or rule of the Scottish Masters gives us the emblem of the building of the Tower of Babel, used by our Scottish Masters, because by irregularity and want of due proportion
and harmony that work was stopped and the workmen could proceed no further.
"Next comes the fourth operation, represented by the Cubical Stone, whose faces and angles are all equal. As soon as the work is brought to the necessary point of multiplication, it is to be submitted to
the third Degree of Fire, wherein it will receive the due proportion of the strength and substance of the metallic particles of the Cubical Stone and this is the fourth point or rule of the Scottish Masters.
"Finally, we come to the fifth and last operation, indicated to us by the Flaming Star. After the work has
become a dulyproportioned substance, it is to be subjected to the fourth and strongest Degree of fire, wherein it must remain three times twentyseven hours; until it is thoroughly glowing, by which means
it becomes a bright and shining tincture, wherewith the lighter metals may be changed, by the use of one part to a thousand of the metal. Wherefore this Flaming Star shows us the fifth and last point of the
Scottish Masters".
"You should pass practically through the five points or rules of the Master, and by the use of one part to a thousand, transmute and ennoble metals. You may then in reality say that your age is a thousand
years."
In the oration of the Degree, the following hints are given as to its true meaning:
"The three divisions of the Temple, the Outer Court, Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, signify the three Principles of our Holy Order, which direct to the knowledge of morality, and teach those most practical
virtues that ought to be practised by mankind. Therefore the Seven Steps which lead up to the Outer Court of the Temple, are the emblem of the Sevenfold Light which we need to possess, before we can
arrive at the height of knowledge, in which consist the ultimate limits of our order".
"In the Brazen Sea we are symbolically to purify ourselves from all pollutions, all faults and wrongful actions, as well those committed through error of judgment and mistaken opinion, as those intentionally
done; inasmuch as they equally prevent us from arriving at the knowledge of True Wisdom. We must thoroughly cleanse and purify our hearts to their inmost recesses, before we can of right contemplate
that Flaming Star, which is the emblem of the Divine and Glorious Shekinah, or presence of God; before we may dare approach the Throne of Supreme Wisdom."
In the Degree of The True Mason [Le Vrai Macon], styled in the titlepage of its Ritual the 23d Degree
of Masonry, or the 12th of the 5th class, the Tracingboard displays a luminous Triangle, with a great

580/641
Yod in the centre.
"The Triangle," says the Ritual, "represents one God in three Persons and the great Yod is the initial letter of the last word".
"The Dark Circle represents the Chaos, which in the beginning God created".
"The Cross within the Circle, the Light by means whereof He developed the Chaos".
"The Square, the four Elements into which it was resolved".
"The Triangle, again, the three Principles [Salt, Sulphur and Mercury], which the intermingling of the
elements produced".
"God creates; Nature produces; Art multiplies. God created Chaos; Nature produced it; God, Nature and Art, have perfected it".
"The Altar of Perfumes indicates the Fire that is to be applied to Nature. The two towers are the two
furnaces, moist and dry, in which it is to be worked. The bowl is the mould of oak that is to inclose the philosophal egg".
"The two figures surmounted by a Cross are the two vases, Nature and Art, in which is to be
consummated the double marriage of the white woman with the red Servitor, from which marriage will spring a most Potent King".
"Chaos means universal matter, formless, but susceptible of all forms. Form is the Light inclosed in the
seeds of all species and its home is in the Universal Spirit".
"To work on universal matter, use the internal and external fire; the four elements result, the Principia Principiorum and Inmediata; Fire, Air, Water, Earth. There are four qualities of these elements: the
warm and dry, the cold and moist. Two appertain to each element: The dry and cold, to the Earth; the cold and moist, to Water; the moist and warm, to the Air; and the warm and dry, to Fire; whereby the
Fire connects with the Earth; all the elements, as Hermes said, moving in circles".

"From the mixture of the four Elements and of their four qualities, result the three Principles, Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt. These are the philosophical, not the vulgar".
"The philosophical Mercury is a Water and SPIRIT, which dissolves and sublimates the Sun; the
philosophical Sulphur, a fire and a SOUL, which mollifies and colors it; the philosophical Salt, an Earth and a BODY, which coagulates and fixes it and the whole is done in the bosom of the Air".
"From these three Principles result the four Elements duplicated, or the Grand Elements, Mercury,
Sulphur, Salt, and Glass; two of which are volatile, the Water [Mercury] and the Air [Sulphur], which is oil; for all substances liquid in their nature avoid fire, which takes from the one [water] and burns the
other [oil]; but the other two are dry and solid, to wit, the Salt, wherein Fire is contained, and the pure Earth, which is the Glass; on both of which the Fire has no other action than to melt and refine them,
unless one makes use of the liquid alkali. For, just as each element consists of two qualities, so these great duplicated Elements partake, each of two of the simple elements, or, more properly speaking, of
all the four, according to the greater or less degree of each, the Mercury partaking more of the Water, to which it is assigned; the Oil or Sulphur, more of the Air; the Salt, of the Fire and the Glass, of the
Earth; which is found, pure and clear, in the centre of all the elementary composites, and is the last to disengage itself from the others".
"The four Elements and three Principles reside in all the Compounds, Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral;
but more potently in some than in others".
"The Fire gives them Movement; the Air, Sensation; the Water, Nutriment; and the Earth, Subsistence".
"The four duplicated Elements engender THE STONE, if one is careful enough to supply them with the proper quantity of fire and to combine them according to their natural weight. Ten parts of Air make
one of Water; ten of Water, one of Earth and ten of Earth, one of Fire; the whole by the Active Symbol of the one, and the Passive Symbol of the other, whereby the conversion of the Elements is effected".
The Allusion of the Ritual, here, is obviously to the four Worlds of the Kabalah. The ten Sephiroth of
the world Briah proceed from Malakoth, the last of the ten Emanations of the world Aziquth; the ten Sephiroth of the world Yezirah, from Malakoth of Briah and the ten of the world Asiah, from Malakoth
of Yezirah. The Password of the Degree is given as Metralon, which is a corruption of METATRON, the Cherub, who and Sandalphon are in the Kabalah the Chief of the Angels. The Active and Passive
Symbols are the Male and Female.

"It is thereby evident that, in the Great Work, we rnust employ ten parts of philosophical Mercury to
one of Sun or Moon".
"This is attained by Solution and Coagulation. These words mean that we must dissolve the body and coagulate the spirit; which operations are effected by the moist and dry bath".
"Of colors, black is the Earth; white, the Water; blue, the Air and red, the Fire; wherein also are
involved very great secrets and mysteries".
"The apparatus employed in 'The Great Work' consists of the Moist bath, the Dry bath, the Vases of Nature and Art, the bowl of oak, lutum sapientiae, the Seal of Hermes, the tube, the physical lamp, and
the iron rod".
"The work is perfected in seventeen philosophical months, according to the mixture of ingredients. The benefits reaped from it are of two kinds one affecting the soul and the other the body. The former
consist in knowing God, Nature, and ourself and those to the body are wealth and health".
"The Initiate traverses Heaven and Earth. Heaven is the World manifest to the Intelligence, subdivided into Paradise and Hell; Earth is the World manifest to the Senses, also subdivided into the Celestial and
that of the Elements".
"There are Sciences specially connected with each of these. The one is ordinary and common; the other, mystic and secret. The World cognizable by the Intellect has the Hermetic Theology and the
Kabalah; the Celestial Astrology; and that of the Elements, Chemistry, which by its decompositions and separations, effected by fire, reveals all the most hidden secrets of Nature, in the three kinds of
Compound Substances. This last science is styled 'Hermetic,' or 'The operating of the Great Work.'"
The Ritual of the Degree of Kabalistic and Hermetic Rose has these passages:
"The true Philosophy, known and practised by Solomon, is the basis on which Masonry is founded".
"Our Ancient Masons have concealed from us the most important point of this Divine Art, under hieroglyphical characters, which are but enigmas and parables, to all the Senseless. the Wicked, and the
Ambitious".

"He will be supremely fortunate, who shall, by arduous labor, discover this sacred place of deposite,
wherein all naked the sublime Truth is hidden; for he may be assured that he has found the True Light, the True Felicity, the True Heavenly Good. Then may it truly be said that he is one of the True Elect; for
it is the only real and most Sublime Science of all those to which a mortal can aspire: his days will be prolonged and his soul freed of all vices and corruption; into which" (it is added, to mislead, as if from
fear too much would be disclosed), "the human race is often led by indigence".
As the symbolism of the Hall and the language of the ritual mutually explain each other, it should be noted here, that in this Degree the columns of the hall, 12 in number, are white variegated with black
and red. The hangings are black, and over that crimson.
Over the throne is a great Eagle, in gold, on a black ground. In the centre of the Canopy the Blazing Star in gold, with the letter Yod in its centre. On the right and left of the throne are the Sun in gold and
the Moon in silver. The throne is ascended to by three Steps. The hall and anteroom are each lighted by ten lights, and a single one at the entrance. The colors, black, white, and crimson appear in the clothing
and the Key and Balance are among the symbols.
The duty of the Second Grand Prior says the Ritual is "to see if the Chapter is hermetically sealed; whether the materials are ready, and the elements; whether the Black gives place to the White and the
White to the Red."
"Be laborious," it says, "like the Star and procure the light of the Sages and hide yourself from the Stupid Profane and the Ambitious and be like the Owl, which sees only by night and hides itself from
treacherous curiosity."
"The Sun, on entering each of his houses, should be received there by the four elements, which you must be careful to invite to accompany you, that they may aid you in your undertaking; for without
them the House would be melancholy; wherefore you will give him to feast upon the four elements".
"When he shall have visited his twelve houses and seen you attentive there to receive him, you will become one of his chiefest favorites and he will allow you to share all his gifts. Matter will then no
longer have power over you; you will, so to say be no longer a dweller on the earth; but after certain periods you will give back to it a body which is its own, to take in its stead one altogether Spiritual.
Matter is then deemed to be dead to the world".

"Therefore it must be revivified and made to be born again from its ashes, which you will effect by virtue of the vegetation of the Tree of Life, represented to us by the branch of acacia. Whoever shall
learn to comprehend and execute this great work, will know great things, say the Sages of the work; but whenever you depart from the centre of the Square and the Compass you will no longer be able to work
with success.
"Another Jewel is necessary for you and in certain undertakings cannot be dispensed with. It is what is titled the Kabalistic pantacle. This carries with it the power of commanding the spirits of the elements.
It is necessary for you to know how to use it and that you will learn by perseverance if you are a lover of the science of our predecessors the Sages".
"A great Black Eagle, the King of Birds. He alone it is that can fire the Sun, material in its nature, that
has no form, and yet by its form develops color. The black is a complete harbinger of the work. It changes color and assumes a natural form, out whereof will emerge a brilliant Sun".
"The birth of the Sun is always announced by its Star, represented by the Blazing Star, which you will
know by its fiery color and it is followed in its course by the silvery lustre of the Moon".
"A rough Ashlar is the shapeless stone which is to be prepared in order to commence the philosophical work and to be developed, in order to change its form from triangular to cubic, after the separation from
it of its Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, by the aid of the Square, Level, Plumb and Balance and all the other Masonic implements which we use symbolically".
"Here me put them to philosophical use, to constitute a well proportioned edifice, through which you
are to make pass the crude material, analogous to a candidate commencing his initiation into our Mysteries. When we build we must observe all the rules and proportions; for otherwise the Spirit of
Life cannot lodge therein. So you will build the great tower, in which is to burn the fire of the Sages, or in other words, the fire of Heaven. As also the Sea of the Sages, in which the Sun and Moon are to
bathe. That is the basin of Purification, in which will be the water of Celestial Grace, water that doth not soil the hands, but purifies all leprous bodies".
"Let us labor to instruct our Brother, to the end that by his toils he may succeed in discovering the
principle of life contained in the profundity of matter and known by the name of Alkahest".
"The most potent of the names of Deity is ADONAI. Its power is to put the Universe in movement; and the Knights who shall be fortunate enough to possess it, with weight and measure, shall have at their

sciences that man is capable of knowing. By its power they would succeed in discovering the primary metal of the Sun, which holds within itself the Principle of the germ, and wherewith we can put in
alliance and six other metals, each of which contains the principles and primitive seed of the grand philosophical work".
"The six other metals are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury and Luna; vulgarly known as Lead,
Tin, Iron, Copper, Quicksilver, and Silver. Gold is not included; because it is not in its nature a metal. It is all Spirit and incorruptible; wherefore it is the emblem of the Sun, which presides over the Light".
"The vivifying Spirit, called Alkahest, has in itself the generative virtue of producing the triangular
Cubical Stone, and contains in itself all the virtues to render men happy in this world and in that to come. To arrive at the eomposition of that Alkahest, we begin by laboring at the science of the union of
the four Elements which are to be educed from the three Kingdoms of Nature, Mineral, Vegetable and Animal; the rule, measure, weight and equipoise whereof have each their key. We then employ in one
work the animals, vegetables, and minerals, each in his season, which make the space of the Houses of the Sun, where they have all the virtues required".
"Something from each of the three Kingdoms of Nature is assigned to each Celestial House, to the end
that everything may be done in accordance with sound philosophical rules and the everything may be thoroughly purified in its proper time and place in order to be presented at the weddingtable of the
Spouse and the six virgins who hold the mystic shovel, without a common fire, but with an elementary fire, that comes primarily by attraction and by digestion in the philosophical bed lighted by the four
elements".
"At the banquet of the Spouses, the viands, being thoroughly, purified, are served in Salt, Sulphur, Spirit and Oil; a sufficient quantity thereof is taken every month, and therewith is compounded, by
means of the Balance of Solomon, the Alkahest, to serve the Spouses, when they are laid on the nuptial bed, there to engender their embryo, producing for the human race immense treasures, that will last as
long as the world endures.
"Few are capable of engaging in this great work. Only the true FreeMasons may of right aspire to it and even of them, very few are worthy to attain it, bccause most of them are ignorant of the Clavicules and
their contents, and of the Pantacle of Solomon, which teaches how to labor at the great work".
"The weight raised by Solomon with his balance was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; which contains 25 times unity, 2 multiplied by 2; 3 multiplied by 3; 4 multiplied by 4; 5 multiplied by 5, and once 9; these numbers thus
involving the squares of 5 and 2, the cube of 2, the square of the square of 2, and the square of 3".

Thus far the Ritual, in the numbers mentioned by it, is an allusion to the 47th problem of Euclid, a
symbol of Blue Masonry, entirely out of place there and its meaning unknown. The base of the right angled triangle being 3 and the perpendicular 4, the hypothenuse is 5, by the rule that the sum of the
squares of the two former equals the square of the latter, 3 X 3 being 9; and 4 X 4, 16, and 9 + 16 being 25, the square of 5. The triangle contains in its sides the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The Perpendicular is the
Male; the Base, the Female; the Hypothenuse, the product of the two.
To fix the volatile, in the Hermetic language, means to materialize the spirit; to volatilize the fixed is to spiritualize matter.
To separate the subtile from the gross, in the first operation, which is wholly internal, is to free our soul
from all prejudice and all vice. This is effected by the use of the philosophical SALT, that is to say, of WISDOM; of MERCURY, that is to say, of personal aptitude and labor and of SULPHUR, which
represents the vital energy and the ardor of the will. Thus we succeed in changing into spiritual gold such things even as are of least value and even the foul things of the earth.
It is in this sense we are to understand the parables of the Hermetic philosophers and the prophets of
Alchemy; but in their works, as in the Great Work, we must skillfully separate the subtile from the gross, the mystic from the positive, allegory from theory. If you would read them with pleasure and
understandingly, you must first understand them allegorically in their entirety and then descend from allegories to realities by way of the correspondences or analogies indicated in the single dogma:
"What is above is like what is below and what is below is like what is above."
The treatise "Minerva Mundi," attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, contains, under the most poetical
and profound allegories, the dogma of the selfcreation of beings, or of the law of creation that results from the accord of two forces, these which the Alchemists called the Fixed and the Volatile and which
are, in the Absolute, Necessity and Liberty.
When the Masters in Alchemy say that it needs but little time and expense to accomplish the works of Science, when they affirm, above all, that but a single vessel is necessary, when they speak of the Great
and Single furnace, which all can use, which is within the reach of all the world and which men possess without knowing it, they allude to the philosophical and moral Alchemy. In fact, a strong and
determined will can, in a little while, attain complete independence and we all possess that chemical instrument, the great and single athanor or furnace, which serves to separate the subtile from the gross
and the fixed from the volatile. This instrument, complete as the world, and accurate as the mathematics

themselves, is designated by the Sages under the emblem of the Pentagram or Star with five points, the absolute sign of human intelligence.
The end and perfection of the Great Work is expressed, in alchemy, by a triangle surmounted by a cross:
and the letter Tau, the last of the Sacred alphabet, has the same meaning.
The "elementary fire" that comes primarily by attraction, is evidently Electricity or the Electric Force, primarily developed as magnetism and in which is perhaps the secret of life or the vital force.
Paracelsus, the great Reformer in medicine, discovered magnetism long before Mesmer, and pushed to
its last consequences this luminous discovery, or rather this initiation into the magic of the ancients, who understood the grand magical agent better than we do and did not regard the Astral Light, Azoth,
the universal magnetism of the Sages, as an animal and particular fluid, emanating only from certain special beings.
The four Elements, the four symbolic animals and the reduplicated Principles correspond with each
other and are thus arranged by the Hermetic Masons.
The Air and Earth represent the Male Principle and the Fire and Water belong to the Female Principle.
To these four forms correspond the four following philosophical ideas:
Spirit, Matter, Movement, Repose
Alchemy reduces these four things to three:
The Absolute, the Fixed, the Volatile
Reason, Necessity, Liberty are the synonyms of these three words.
As all the great Mysteries of God and the Universe are thus hidden in the Ternary, it everywhere appears in Masonry and in the Hermetic Philosophy under its mask of Alchemy. It even appears where
Masons do not suspect it; to teach the doctrine of the equilibrium of Contraries, and the resultant

Harmony.
The double triangle of Solomon is explained by Saint John in a remarkable manner: There are, he says, three witnesses in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit and three witnesses on earth, the
breath, water, and blood. He thus agrees with the Masters of the Hermetic Philosophy, who give to their Sulphur the name of Ether, to their Mercury the name of philosophical water, to their Salt that of blood
of the dragon, or menstruum of the earth. The blood, or Salt, corresponds by opposition with the Father; the Azothic, or Mercurial water, with the Word, or Logos and the breath, with the Holy Spirit.
But the things of High Symbolism can be well understood only by the true children of Science.
Alchemy has its Symbolic Triad of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, man consisting, according to the Hermetic philosophers, of Body, Soul and Spirit. The Dove, the Raven, and the Phoenix are striking
Symbols of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, and the Beauty resulting from the equilibrium of the two.
If you would understand the true secrets of Alchemy, you must study the works of the Masters with
patience and assiduity. Every word is often an enigma and to him who reads in haste, the whole will seem absurd. Even when they seem to teach that the Great Work is the purification of the Soul and so to
deal only with morals, they most conceal their meaning, and deceive all but the Initiates.
Yod is termed in the Kabalah the opifex, workman of the Deity. It is, says the Porta Coelorum, single and primal, like one, which is the first among numbers and like a point, the first before all bodies.
Moved lengthwise, it produces a line, which is Vau and this moved sidewise produces a superficies, which is Daleth. Thus Vau becomes Daleth; for movement tends from right to left and all
communication is from above to below. The plenitude of Yod, that is, the name of this letter, spelled, is YOD. Vau [which represents 6] and Daleth [4] are 10; like Yod, their principle.
Yod, says the Siphra de Zeniutha, is the Symbol of Wisdom and of the Father.
The Principle called Father, says the Idra Suta, is comprehended in Yod, which flows downward from
the Holy influence, wherefore Yod is the most occult of all the letters; for he is the beginning and end of all things. The Supernal Wisdom is Yod and all things are included in Yod, who is therefore called
Father of Fathers,or the Generator of the Universal. The Principle of all things is called the House of all things: wherefore Yod is the beginning and end of all things; as it is written: "Thou hast made all things
in Wisdom". For The All is termed Wisdom and in it The All is contained and the summary of all things is the Holy Name.

Yod, says the Siphra de Zeniutha, signifying the Father, approaches the letter He, which is the Mother and by the combination of these two is denoted that luminous infiuence wherewith Binah is imbued by
the Supernal Wisdom.
In the name, says the same, are included the Father, Mother and Microprosopos, their issue. He, impregnated by Vau, produced Microprosopos, or Seir Anpin.
Wisdom, Hakemah, is the Principle of all things. It is the Father of Fathers and in it are the beginning
and end of all things. Microprosopos, the second Universal, is the issue of Wisdom, the Father and Binah, the Mother, and is composed of the six Numerations, Geburah, Gedulah and Tephareth, Netsach
Hod, and Yesod; is represented under the form of a man, and said to have at first occupied the place afterward filled by the world Briah [of Creation], but afterward to have been raised to the Aziluthic
sphere and received Wisdom, Intelligence and Cognition [Daath] from the Supernal Wisdom and Intellectuality.
Vau, in the triliteral word, denotes these six members of Microprosopos. For this latter is formed after
the fashion of Macroprosopos, but without Kether, the will, which remains in the first prototype or Universal; though invested with a portion of the Divine Intellectual Power and Capacity. The first
Universal does not use the first person, and is called in the third person, HUA, HE: but the second Universal speaks in the first person, using the word ANI, I.
The IDRA RABBA, or Synodus Magna, one of the books of the Sohar, says:
The Eldest of the Eldest [the Absolute Deity] is in Microprosopos. All things are one: all was, all is, all
will be: there neither will be, nor is, nor has been, mutation.
But He confirmed Himself, by the formings, into a form that contains all forms. in a form which comprehends all genera. This form is in the likeness of His form and is not that form but its analogue;
wherefore the human form is the form of all above and below, which are included in it because it embraces all above and below. The Most Holy so took form, and so Microprosopos was configured. All
things are equally one, in each of the two Universals; but in the second His ways are divided and judgment is on our side and on the side that looks toward us, also, they differ.
These Secrets are made known only to the reapers in the Holy Field.
The Most Holy Ancient is not called ATHAU, Thou, but HUA, He; but in Microprosopos, where is the

beginning of things, He has the name ATHAH, and also AB, Father. From Him is the beginning, and He is called Thou, and is the Father of Fathers. He issues from the NonEns; and therefore is beyond
cognition.
Wisdom is the Principle of the Universe and from it thirtytwo ways diverge: and in them the law is contained, in twentytwo letters and ten words. Wisdom is the Father of Fathers and in this Wisdom is
found the Beginning and the End: wherefore there is a wisdom in each Universal, one above, the other below.
The Commentary of Rabbi Chajun Vital, on the Siphra de Zeniutha, says: At the beginning of
emanation, Microprosopos issued from the Father, and was intermingled with the Mother, under the mysteries of the letter [He], resolved that is, Daleth and Vau; by which Vau is denoted Microprosopos;
because Vau is six, and he is constituted of the six parts that follow Hakemah and Binah. And, according to this conception, the Father is called Father of Fathers, because from Him these Fathers
proceed, Benignity, Severity, and Beauty. Microprosopos was then like the letter Vau in the letter He, because He had no head; but when He was now born, three brains were constituted for Him, by the flow
of Divine Light from above.
And as the world of restitution [after the vessels of the Sephiroth below Binah had been broken, that from the fragments evil might be created] is instituted after the fashion of the Balance, so also is it
formed throughout in the human form. But Malakoth, Regnum, is a complete and separate person, behind Microprosopos, and in conjunction with him and the two are called man.
The first world [of Inanity] could not continue and did not subsist, because it had no human
conformation nor the system of the Balance, the Sephiroth being points, one below the other. The first Adam [Microprosopos, as distinguished from Macroprosopos, the first Occult Adam] was the
beginning, wherein the ten Numerations proceeded forth from potence into act.
Microprosopos is the second garment or interposed medium, with respect to the Elder Most Holy, who is the name Tetragrammaton and he is called Alohim; because the former is Absolute Commiseration;
while in Macroprosopos his lights have the nature of Severities, with respect to the elder Universal; though they are Commiseration, with respect to the lights of Malakoth and the three lower worlds.
All the conformations of Macroprosopos come from the first Adam; who to interpose a second
covering, caused a single spark to issue from the sphere of Severity, of whose five letters is generated the name Alohim. With this issued from the brain a most subtle air, which takes its place on the right
hand, while the spark of fire is on the left. Thus the white and red do not intermix, that is, the Air and Fire, which are Mercy and Judgment.

Microprosopos is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, his Severities being the Evil.
REGNUM, to which is given the name of Word of The Lord, superinvests Heaven, as the six members
of the Degree Tephareth are called and these become and are constituted by that superior vestiture. For every conformation and constitution is effected by means of veiling, because occultation here is the
same as manifestation, the excess of light being veiled, so that, diminished in intensity and degree, it may be received by those below. Those six members conceived of as contained in Binah, are said to be
in the World of Creation; as in Tephareth, in that of Formation and as in Malakoth, in that of Fabrication.
Before the institution of equilibrium, face was not toward face; Microprosopos and his wife issuing
forth back to back, and yet cohering. So above; before the prior Adam was conformed into male and female, and the state of equilibrium established, the Father and Mother were not face to face. For the
Father denotes the most perfect Love and the Mother the most perfect Rigor. And the seven supernal sons who proceeded from her, from Binah, who brought forth seven, were all most perfect rigors,
having no connection with a root in the Most Holy Ancient; that is, they were all dead, destroyed, shattered; but they were plaeed in equilibrium, in the equipoise of the Occult Wisdom, when it was
conformed into male and female, Rigor and Love, and they were then restored, and there was given them a root above.
The Father is Love and Mercy and with a pure and subtle Aur or Benignity impregnates the Mother,
who is Rigor and Severity of Judgments and the product is the brain of Microprosopos.
It was determined, says the Introduction to the Book Sohar, by the Deity, to create Good and Evil in the world, according to what is said in Isaiah, "who makes the Light and creates the Evil." But the Evil was
at first occult, and could not be generated and brought forth, except by the sinning of the First Adam. Wherefore He determined that the numerations first emanated, from Benignity downward, should be
destroyed and shattered by the excessive influx of His Light; His intention being to create of them the worlds of Evils. But the first three were to remain and subsist, that among the fragments should be
neither Will, Intellectual Power, nor the Capacity of Intellection of the Divinity. The last seven numerations were points, like the first three, each subsisting independently, unsustained by
companionship; which was the cause of their dying and being shattered.
There was then no Love between them, but only a twofold Fear; Wisdom, for example, fearing lest it should ascend again to its Source in Kether; and also lest it should descend into Binah. Hence there was
no union between any two, except Hakemah and Binah, and this imperfect, with averted faces. This is the meaning of the saying, that the world was created by Judgment, which is fear. And so that world

592/641
could not subsist and the Seven Kings were dethroned, until the attribute of Compassion was adjoined to it and then restoration took place. Thence came Love and Union and six of the parts were united into
one person; for Love is the attribute of Compassion or Mercy.
Binah produced the Seven Kings, not successively, but all together. The Seventh is Regnum, called a stone, the cornerstone, because on it are builded the palaces of the three lower worlds.
The first six were shattered into fragments; but Regnum was crushed into a formless mass, lest the
malignant demons created from the fragments of the others should receive bodies from it, since from it came bodies and vitality [Nephesch].
From the fragments of the vessels came all Evils; judgments, turbid waters, impurities, the Serpent, and
Adam Belial [Baal]. But their internal light reascended to Binah and then flowed down again into the worlds Briah and Yezirah, there to form vestiges of the Seven Numerations. The Sparks of the great
Influence of the shattered vases descending into the four spiritual elements, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth and thence into the inanimate, vegetable, living and speaking kingdoms, became Souls.
Selecting the suitable from the unsuitable lights and separating the good from the evil, the Deity first
restored the universality of the Seven Kings of the World Aziluth, and afterward the three other Worlds.
And though in them were both good and evil, still this evil did not develop itself in act, since the Severities remained, though mitigated; some portion of them being necessary to prevent the fragments
of the integuments from ascending. These were also left, because connection of two is necessary to generation. And this necessity for the existence of Severity is the mystery of the pleasure and warmth of
the generative appetite; and thence Love between husband and wife.
If the Deity, says the Introduction, had not created worlds and then destroyed them, there could have been no evil in the world, but all things must have been good. There would have been neither reward
nor punishment in the world. There would have been no merit in righteousness, for the Good is known by the evil, nor would there have been fruitfulness or multiplication in the world. If all carnal
concupiscence were enchained for three days in the mouth of the great abyss, the egg of one of the days would be wanting to the sick man. In time to come it will be called Laban, because it will be whitened
of its impurity, and will return to the realm Israel, and they will pray the Lord to give them the appetite of carnal concupiscence, for the begetting of children.
The intention of God was, when He created the world, that His creatures should recognize His
existence. Therefore He created evils, to afflict them withal when they should sin and Light and

Blessing to reward the just. And therefore man necessarily has freewill and election, since Good and Evil are in the World.
And these kings died, says the Commentary, because the condition of equilibrium did not yet exist, nor
was Adam Kadmon formed male and female. They were not in contact with what was alive: nor had any root in Adam Kadmon; nor was Wisdom which outflowed from Him, their root, nor did they
connect with it. For all these were pure mercies and most simple Love; but those were rigorous judgments. Whence face looked not toward face; nor the Father toward the Mother, because from her
proceeded judgments. Nor Macroprosopos toward Microprosopos. And Regnum, the last numeration, was empty and inane. It has nothing of itself and as it were, was nothing, receiving nothing from them.
Its need was, to receive Love from the Male; for it is mere rigor and judgment; and the Love and Rigor must temper each other, to produce creation, and its multitudes above and below. For it was made to be
inhabited and when rigorous judgments rule in it, it is inane because its processes cannot be carried on.
Wherefore the Balance must needs be instituted, that there might be a root above, so that judgments might be restored and tempered and live and not again die. And Seven Conformations descend and all
things become in equilibrium, and the needle of the Balance is the root above.
In the world Yezirah, says the Pneumatica Kabalistica, denotes Kether; Hakemah and Binah; and Gedulah, Geburah, and Tephareth and thus Vau is Beauty and Harmony. The Man is Hakemah; the
Eagle, Binah; the Lion, Gedulah and the Ox, Geburah. And the mysterious circle is thus formed by the Sohar and all the Kabalists. Michael and the face of the Lion are on the South, and the right hand, with
the letter Yod, and Water; Gabriel and the face of the Ox, on the North, and left hand, with the first of the Tetragrammaton and Fire; Uriel and the face of the Eagle, on the East and forward, with and Air;
and Raphael and the face of the Man, on the West, and backward with the last Earth. In the same order, the four letters represent the four worlds.
Rabbi Schimeon Ben Jochai says that the four animals of the Mysterious Chariot, whose wheels are
Netsach and Hod, are Gedulah, whose face is the Lion's; Geburah, with that of the Ox; Tephareth, with that of the Eagle and Malakoth, with that of the Man.
The Seven lower Sephiroth, says the AEsch Mezareph, will represent Seven Metals; Gedulah and
Geburah, Silver and Gold: Tephareth, Iron; Netsach and Hod, Tin and Copper; Yesod, Lead and Malakoth will be the metallic Woman and Morn of the Sages, the field wherein are to be sowed the
Seeds of the Secret Minerals, to wit the Water of Gold; but in these such mysteries are concealed as no tongue can utter.
The word Amas, is composed of the initials of the three Hebrew words that signify Air, Water, and Fire;

by which, say the Kabalists, are denoted Benignity, Judicial Rigor, and Mercy or Compassion mediating between them.
Malakoth, says the Apparatus, is called Haikal, Temple or Palace, because it is the Palace of the Degree
Tephareth, which is concealed and contained in it, and Haikal denotes the place in which all things are contained.
For the better understanding of the Kabalah, remember that Kether or the Crown, is treated of as a
person, composed of the ten Numerations and as such termed Arik Anpin, or Macroprosopos:
That Hakemah is a person, and termed Abba, or Father:
That Binah is a person and termed Mother, Imma:
That Tephareth, including all the Numerations from Khased or Gedulah to Yesod, is a person, called Seir Anpin, or Microprosopos. These Numerations are six in number and are represented by the
interlaced triangle, or the Seal of Solomon.
And Malakoth is a person and called the wife of Microprosopos. Vau represents the Beauty or Harmony, consisting of the six parts which constitute Seir Anpin.
The wife Malakoth, is said to be behind the husband, Seir and to have no other cognition of him. And
this is thus explained: That every cognizable object is to be known in two ways; a priori, which is when it is known by means of its cause, or of itself; or a posteriori when it is known by its effects. The most
nearly perfect mode of cognition is, when the intellect knows the thing itself, in itself and through itself. But if it knows the thingby its similitude or idea, or species separate from it, or by its effects and
operations, the cognition is much feebler and more imperfect. And it is thus only that Regnum, the wife of Seir, knows her husband, until face is turned to face, when they unite and she has the more nearly
perfect knowledge. For then the Deity, as limited and manifested in Seir and the Universe are one.
Vau is Tephareth, considered as the Unity in which are the six members, of which itself is one. Tephareth, Beauty, is the column which supports the world, symbolized by the colum of the junior
Warden in the Blue Lodges. The world was first created by Judgment and as it could not so subsist, Mercy was conjoined with Judgment, and the Divine Mercies sustain the Universe.

God, says the Idra Suta, formed all things in the form of male and female, since otherwise the continuance of things was im possible. The Allembracing Wisdom, issuing and shining from the Most
Holy Ancient, shines not otherwise than as male an female. Wisdom as the Father, Intelligence the Mother, are in equilibrium as male and female, and they are conjoined, an one shines in the other. Then
they generate and are expanded in the Truth. Then the two are the Perfection of all things, when they are coupled; and when the Son is in them, the summary of all things is in one.
These things are intrusted only to the Holy Superiors, who have entered and gone out and known the
ways of the Most Holy God, so as not to err in them, to the right hand or to the lef For these things are hidden and the lofty Holinesses shine in them, as light flows from the splendor of a lamp.
These things are committed only to those who have entered and not withdrawn; for he who has not done
so had better never have been born.
All things are comprehended in the letters Vau and He; an all are one system and these are the letters, Tabunah Intelligence.
XXIX. GRAND SCOTTISH KNIGHT OF ST. ANDREW
A MIRACULOUS tradition, something like that connected with the labarum of Constantine, hallows
the Ancient Cross of St. Andrew. Hungus, who in the ninth century reigned over the Picts in Scotland, is said to have seen in a vision, on the night before a battle, the Apostle Saint Andrew, who promised
him the victory; and for an assured token thereof, he told him that there should appear over the Pictish host, in the air, such a fashioned cross as he had suffered upon. Hungus, awakened, looking up at the
sky, saw the promised cross, as did all of both armies; and Hungus and the Picts, after rendering thanks to the Apostle for their victory, and making their offerings with humble devotion, vowed that from
thenceforth, as well they as their posterity, in time of war, would wear a cross of St Andrew for their badge and cognizance.
John Leslie, Bishop of Ross, says that this cross appeared to Achaius, King of the Scots, and Hungus,
King of the Picts, the night before the battle was fought betwixt them and Athelstane, King of England, as they were on their knees at prayer.
Every cross of Knighthood is a symbol of the nine qualities of a Knight of St. Andrew of Scotland; for
every order of chivalry required of its votaries the same virtues and the same excellencies.

596/641
Humility, Patience, and Selfdenial are the three essential qualities of a Knight of St. Andrew of
Scotland. The Cross, sanctified by the blood of the holy ones who have died upon it; the Cross, which Jesus of Nazareth bore, fainting, along the streets of Jerusalem and up to Calvary, upon which He cried,
"Not My will, O Father! but Thine be done," is an unmistakable and eloquent symbol of these three virtues. He suffered upon it, because He consorted with and taught the poor and lowly, and found His
disciples among the fishermen of Galilee and the despised publicans. His life was one of Humility, Patience, and Selfdenial.
The Hospitallers and Templars took upon themselves vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. The
Lamb, which became the device of the Seal of the Order of the Poor Fellow Soldiery oi the Temple of Solomon, conveyed the same lessons of humility and selfdenial as the original device of two Knights
riding a single horse. The Grand Commander warned every candidate not to be induced to enter the Order by a vain hope of enjoying earthly pomp and splendor. He told him that he would have to endure
many things, sorely against his inclinations; and that he would be compelled to give up his own will, and submit entirely to that of his superiors.
The religious Houses of the Hospitallers, despoiled by Henry the Eighth's worthy daughter, Elizabeth,
because they would not take the oath to maintain her supremacy, had been Almshouses, and Dispensaries, and Foundlingasyla, relieving the State of many orphan and outcast children, and
ministering to their necessities, God's ravens in the wilderness, bread and flesh in the morning, bread and flesh in the evening. They had been Inns to the wayfaring man, who heard from afar the sound of
the Vesperbell, inviting him to repose and devotion at once, and who might sing his matins with the Morning Star, and go on his way rejoicing. And the Knights were no less distinguished by bravery in
battle, than by tenderness and zeal in their ministrations to the sick and dying.
The Knights of St. Andrew vowed to defend all orphans, maidens, and widows of good family, and wherever they heard of murderers, robbers, or masterful thieves who oppressed the people, to bring
them to the laws, to the best of their power.
"If fortune fail you," so ran the vows of RougeCroix, "in divers lands or countries wherever you go or ride that you find any gentleman of name and arms, which hath lost goods, in worship and Knighthood,
in the King's service, or in any other place of worship, and is fallen into poverty, you shall aid, and support, and succor him, in that you may; and he ask of you your goods to his sustenance, you shall
give him part of such goods as God hath sent you to your power, and as you may bear."
Thus CHARITY and GENEROSITY are even more essential qualities of a true and gentle Knight, and have been so in all ages; and so also hath CLEMENCY. It is a mark of a noble nature to spare the

conquered. Valor is then best tempered, when it can turn out a stern fortitude into the mild strains of pity, which never shines more brightly than when she is clad in steel. A martial man, compassionate,
shall conquer both in peace and war; and by a twofold way, get victory with honor. The most famed men in the world have had in them both courage and compassion. An enemy reconciled hath a greater
value than the long train of captives of a Roman triumph.
VIRTUE, TRUTH, and HONOR are the three MOST essential qualities of a Knight of St. Andrew. "Ye shall love God above all things, and be steadfast in the Faith," it was said to the Knights, in their charge,
"and ye shall be true unto your Sovereign Lord, and true to your word and promise. Also, ye shall sit in no place where that any judgment should be given wrongfully against any body, to your knowledge."
The law hath not power to strike the virtuous, nor can fortune subvert the wise. Virtue and Wisdom,
only, perfect and defend man. Virtue's garment is a sanctuary so sacred, that even Princes dare not strike the man that is thus robed. It is the livery of the King of Heaven. It protects us when we are
unarmed; and is an armor that we cannot lose, unless we be false to ourselves. It is the tenure by which we hold of Heaven, without which we are but outlaws, that cannot claim protection. Nor is there
wisdom without virtue, but only a cunning way of procuring our own undoing.
Peace is nigh Where Wisdom's voice has found a listening heart. Amid the howl of more than winter storms, The halcyon hears the voice of vernal hours, Already on the wing.
Sir Launcelot thought no chivalry equal to that of Virtue. This word means not continence only, but
chiefly manliness, and so includes what in the old English was called souffrance, that patient endurance which is like the emerald, ever green and flowering; and also that other virtue, droicture, uprightness, a
virtueso strong and so puissant, that by means of it all earthly things almost attain to be unchangeable. Even our swords are formed to remind us of the Cross, and you and any other of us may live to show
how much men bear and do not die; for this world is a place of sorrow and tears, of great evils and a constant calamity, and if we would win true honor in it, we must permit no virtue of a Knight to
become unfamiliar to us, as men's friends, coldly entreated and not greatly valued, become mere ordinary acquaintances.
We must not view with impatience or anger those who injure us; for it is very inconsistent with
philosophy, and particularly with the Divine Wisdom that should govern every Prince Adept, to betray any great concern about the evils which the world, which the vulgar, whether in robes or tatters, can
inflict upon the brave. The favor of God and the love of our Brethren rest upon a basis which the strength of malice cannot overthrow; and with these and a generous temper and noble equanimity, we
have everything. To be consistent with our professions as Masons, to retain the dignity of our nature, the consciousness of our own honor, the spirit of the high chivalry that is our boast, we must disdain the

598/641
evils that are only material and bodily, and therefore can be no bigger than a blow or a cozenage, than a wound or a dream.
Look to the ancient days, Sir E, for excellent examples of VIRTUE, TRUTH, and HONOR, and imitate
with a noble emulation the Ancient Knights, the first Hospitallers and Templars, and Bayard, and Sydney, and Saint Louis; in the words of Pliny to his friend Maximus, Revere the ancient glory, and that
old age which in man is venerable, in cities sacred. Honor antiquity and great deeds, and detract nothing from the dignity and liberty of any one. If those who now pretend to be the great and mighty,
the learned and wise of the world, shall agree in condemning the memory of the heroic Knights of former ages, and in charging with folly us who think that they should be held in eternal remembrance,
and that we should defend them from an evil hearing, do you remember that if these who now claim to rule and teach the world should condemn or scorn your poor tribute of fidelity, still it is for you to bear
therewith modestly, and yet not to be ashamed, since a day will come when these who now scorn those who were of infinitely higher and finer natures than they are, will be pronounced to have lived poor and
pitiful lives, and the world will make haste to forget them.
But neither must you believe that, even in this very different age, of commerce and trade, of the vast riches of many, and the poverty of thousands, of thriving towns and tenement houses swarming with
paupers, of churches with rented pews, and theatres, operahouses, customhouses, and banks, of steam and telegraph, of shops and commercial palaces, of manufactories and tradesunions, the Goldroom
and the Stock Exchange, of newspapers, elections, Congresses, and Legislatures, of the frightful struggle for wealth and the constant wrangle for place and power, of the worship paid to the children of
mammon, and covetousness of official station, there are no men of the antique stamp for you to revere, no heroic and knightly souls, that preserve their nobleness and equanimity in the chaos of conflicting
passions, of ambition and baseness that welters around them.
It is quite true that Government tends always to become a conspiracy against liberty; or, where votes give place, to fall habitually into such hands that little which is noble or chivalric is found among those
who rule and lead the people. It is true that men, in this present age, become distinguished for other things, and may have name and fame, and flatterers and lacqueys, and the oblation of flattery, who
would, in a knightly age, have been despised for the want in them of all true gentility and courage; and that such men are as likely as any to be voted for by the multitude, who rarely love or discern or receive
truth; who run after fortune, hating what is oppressed, and ready to worship the prosperous; who love accusation and hate apologies; and who are always glad to hear and ready to believe evil of those who
care not for their favor and seek not their applause.
But no country can ever be wholly without men of the old heroic strain and stamp, whose word no man will dare to doubt, whose virtue shines resplendent in all calamities and reverses and amid all
temptations, and whose honor scintillates and glitters as purely and perfectly as the diamond men who

are not wholly, he slaves of the material occupations and pleasures of life, wholly engrossed in trade, in the breeding of cattle, in the framing and enforcing of revenue regulations, in the chicanery of the law,
the objects of political envy, in the base trade of the lower literature, or in the heartless, hollow vanities of an eternal dissipation. Every generation, in every country, will bequeath to those who succeed it
splendid examples and great images of the dead, to be admired and imitated; there were such among the Romans, under the basest Emperors; such in England when the Long Parliament ruled; such in France
during its Saturnalia of irreligion and murder, and some such have made the annals of America illustrious.
When things tend to that state and condition in which, in any country under the sun, the management of
its affairs and the customs of its people shall require men to entertain a disbelief in the virtue and honor of those who make and those who are charged to execute the laws; when there shall be everywhere a
spirit of suspicion and scorn of all who hold or seek office, or have amassed wealth; when falsehood shall no longer dishonor a man, and oaths give no assurance of true testimony, and one man hardly
expect another to keep faith with him, or to utter his real sentiments, or to be true to any party or to any cause when another approaches him with a bribe; when no one shall expect what he says to be printed
without additions, perversions, and misrepresentations; when public misfortunes shall be turned to private profit, the press pander to licentiousness, the pulpit ring with political harangues, long prayers
to God, eloquently delivered to admiring auditors, be written out for publication, like poems and political speeches; when the uprightness of judges shall be doubted, and the honesty of legislators be a
standing jest; then men may come to doubt whether the old days were not better than the new, the Monastery than the Opera Bouffe, the little chapel than the drinkingsaloon, the Convents than the
buildings as large as they, without their antiquity, without their beauty, without their holiness, true Acherusian Temples, where the passerby hears from within the neverceasing din and clang and
clashing of machinery, and where, when the bell rings, it is to call wretches to their work and not to their prayers; where, says an animated writer, they keep up a perennial laudation of the Devil, before
furnaces which are never suffered to cool.
It has been well said, that whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses, whatever makes the Past, the Distant, or the Future, predominate over the Present, advances us in the dignity of thinking
beings. The modern rivals of the German Spa, with their flaunting pretences and cheap finery, their follies and frivolities, their chronicles of dances and inelegant feasts, and their bulletins of women's
names and dresses, are poor substitutes for the Monastery and Church which our ancestors would have built in the deep sequestered valleys, shut up between rugged mountains and forests of sombre pine; and
a man of meditative temper, learned, and of poetic feeling, would be glad if he could exchange the showy hotel, amid the roar and tumult of the city, or the pretentious tavern of the countrytown, for one
old humble Monastery by the wayside, where he could refresh himself and his horse without having to fear either pride, impertinence, or knavery to pay for pomp, glitter, and gaudy ornamentation; then
where he could make his orisons in a church which resounded with divine harmony, and there were no pews for wealth to isolate itself within; where he could behold the poor happy and edified and
strengthened with the thoughts of Heaven; where he could then converse with learned and holy and

gentle men, and before he took his departure could exalt and calm his spirits by hearing the evening song.
Even FreeMasonry has so multiplied its members that its obligations are less regarded than the simple
promises which men make to one another upon the streets and in the markets. It clamors for public notice and courts notoriety by scores of injudicious journals; it wrangles in these, or, incorporated by
law, carries its controversies into the Courts. Its elections are, in some Orients, conducted with all the heat and eagerness, the officeseeking and management of political struggles for place. And an empty
pomp, with semimilitary dress and drill, of peaceful citizens, glittering with painted banners, plumes, and jewels, gaudy and ostentatious, commends to the public favor and female admiration an Order that
challenges comparison with the noble Knights, the heroic soldiery encased in steel and mail, stern despisers of danger and death, who made themselves immortal memories, and won Jerusalem from the
infidels and fought at Acre and Ascalon, and were the bulwark of Christendom against the Saracenic legions that swarmed after the green banner of the Prophet Mohammed.
If you, Sir E, would be respectable as a Knight, and not a mere tinselled pretender and Knight of straw,
you must practise, and be diligent and ardent in the practice of, the virtues you have professed in this Degree. How can a Mason vow to be tolerant, and straightway denounce another for his political
opinions? How vow to be zealous and constant in the service of the Order and be as useless to it as if he were dead and buried? What does the symbolism of the Compass and Square profit him, if his sensual
appetites and baser passions are not governed by, but domineer over his moral sense and reason, the animal over the divine, the earthly over the spiritual, both points of the compass remaining below the
Square? What a hideous mockery to call one "Brother," whom he maligns to the Profane, lends money unto at usury, defrauds in trade, or plunders at law by chicanery?
VIRTUE, TRUTH, HONOR! possessing these and never proving false to your vows, you will be worthy
to call yourself a Knight, to whom Sir John Chandos might, if living, give his hand, and whom St. Louis and Falkland, Tancred and Baldassar Castiglione would recognize as worthy of their friendship.
Chivalry, a noble Spaniard said, is a religious Order, and there are Knights in the fraternity of Saints in
Heaven. Therefore do you here, and for all time to come, lay aside all uncharitable and repining feeling; be proof henceforward against the suggestions of undisciplined passion and inhuman zeal; learn to hate
the vices and not the vicious; be content with the discharge of the duties which your Masonic and Knightly professions require; be governed by the old principles of honor and chivalry, and reverence
with constancy that Truth which is as sacred and immutable as God Himself. And above all, remember always, that jealousy is not our life, nor disputation our end, nor disunion our health, nor revenge our
happiness; but lovingkindness is all these, greater than Hope, greater than Faith, which can remove mountains, properly the only thing which God requires of us, and in the possession of which lies the
fulfillment of all our duties.

[By Ill .'. Bro .'. Rev .'. W.W. Lord, 32d.]
We are constrained to confess it to be true, that men, in this Age of Iron, worship gods of wood and iron
and brass, the work of their own hands. The SteamEngine is the preeminent god of the nineteenth century, whose idolaters are everywhere, and those, who wield its tremendous power securely account
themselves gods, everywhere in the civilized world.
Others confess it everywhere, and we must confess here, how reluctantly soever, that the age which we represent is narrowed and not enlarged by its discoveries, and has lost a larger world than it has gained.
If we cannot go as far as the satirist who says that our selfadored century its broad clown's back turns broadly on the glory of the stars, we can go with him when he adds,
We are gods by our own reckoning, and may as well shut up our temples And wield on amidst the
incensesteam, the thunder of our cars. For we throw out acclamations of selfthanking, selfadmiring With, at every step, "Run faster, O the wondrous, wondrous age!" Little heeding if our souls are
wrought as nobly as our iron, Or if angels will commend us at the goal of pilgrimage.
Deceived by their increased but still very imperfect knowledge and limited mastery of the brute forces of nature, men imagine that they have discovered the secrets of Divine Wisdom, and do not hesitate, in
their own thoughts, to put human prudence in the place of the Divine. Destruction was denounced by the Prophets against Tyre and Sidon, Babylon, and Damascus, and Jerusalem, as a consequence of the
sins of their people; but if fire now consumes or earthquake shatters or the tornado crushes a great city, those are scoffed at as fanatics and sneered at for indulging in cant, or rebuked for Pharisaic
uncharitableness, who venture to believe and say that there are divine retributions and God's judgment in the ruin wrought by His mighty agencies.
Science, wandering in error, struggles to remove God's Providence to a distance from us and the
material Universe, and to substitute for its supervision and care and constant overseeing, what it calls Forces Forces of Nature Forces of Matter. It will not see that the Forces of Nature are the varied actions
of God. Hence it becomes antagonistic to all Religion, and to all the old Faith that has from the beginning illuminated human souls and constituted their consciousness of their own dignity, their
divine origin, and their immortality; that Faith which is the Light by which the human soul is enabled, as it were, to see itself.
It is not one religion only, but the basis of all religions, the Truth that is in all religions, even the
religious creed of Masonry, that is in danger. For all religions have owed all of life that they have had,

and their very being, to the foundation on which they were reared; the proposition, deemed undeniable and an axiom, that the Providence of God rules directly in all the affairs and changes of material things.
The Science of the age has its hands upon the pillars of the Temple, and rocks it to its foundation. As yet its destructive efforts have but torn from the ancient structure the wormeaten fretwork of
superstition, and shaken down some incoherent additionsowlinhabited turrets of ignorance, and massive props that supported nothing. The structure itself will be overthrown, when, in the vivid
language of a living writer, "Human reason leaps into the throne of God and waves her torch over the ruins of the Universe."
Science deals only with phenomena, and is but charlatanism when it babbles about the powers or causes
that produce these, or what the things are, in essence, of which it gives us merely the names. It no more knows what Light or Sound or Perfume is, than the Aryan cattleherders did, when they counted the
Dawn and Fire, Flame and Light and Heat as gods. And that Atheistic Science is not even halfscience, which ascribes the Universe and its powers and forces to a system of natural laws or to an inherent
energy of Nature, or to causes unknown, existing and operating independently of a Divine and Supra natural power.
That theory would be greatly fortified, if science were always capable of protecting life and property,
and, with anything like the certainty of which it boasts, securing human interests even against the destructive agencies that man himself develops in his endeavors to subserve them. Fire, the fourth
element, as the old philosophers deemed it, is his most useful and abject servant. Why cannot man prevent his ever breaking that ancient indenture, old as Prometheus, old as Adam? Why can he not be
certain that at any moment his terrible subject may not break forth and tower up into his master, tyrant, destroyer? It is because it also is a power of nature; which, in ultimate trial of forces, is always superior
to man. It is also because, in a different sense from that in which it is the servant of man, it is the servant of Him Who makes His ministers a flame of fire, and Who is over nature, as nature is over man.
There are powers of nature which man does not even attempt to check or control. Naples does nothing
against Vesuvius. Valparaiso only trembles with the trembling earth before the coming earthquake. The sixty thousand people who went down alive into the grave when Lisbon buried her population under
both earth and sea had no knowledge of the causes, and no possible contro1 over the power, that effected their destruction.
But here the servant, and, in a sense, the creature of man, the drudge of kitchen and factory, the humble
slave of the lamp, engaged in his most servile employment, appearing as a little point of flame, or perhaps a feeble spark, suddenly snaps his brittle chain, breaks from his prison, and leaps with
destructive fury, as if from the very bosom of Hell, upon the doomed dwellings of fifty thousand human beings, each of whom, but a moment before, conceived himself his master. And those daring
firebrigades, with their waterartillery, his conquerors, it seemed, upon so many midnight fields, stand

paralyzed in the presence of their conqueror.
In other matters relative to human safety and interests we have observed how confident science becomes upon the strength of some slight success in the war of man with nature, and how much
inclined to put itself in the place of Providence, which, by the very force of the tern, is the only absolute science. Near the beginning of this century, for instance, medical and sanitary science had made, in the
course of a few years, great and wonderful progress. The great plague which wasted Europe in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and reappeared in the seventeenth, had been identified with a disease
which yields to enlightened treatment, and its ancient virulence was attributed to ignorance of hygiene, and the filthy habits of a former age. Another fatal and disfiguring scourge had to a great extent been
checked by the discovery of vaccination. From Sangrado to Sydenham, from Paracelsus to Jenner, the healing art had indeed taken a long stride. The Faculty might be excused had it then said, "Man is
mortal, disease will be often fatal; but there shall be no more unresisted and unnecessary slaughter by infectious disease, no more general carnage, no more carnivals of terror and high festivals of death".
The conceited boast would hardly have died upon the lip, when, from the mysterious depths of remotest
India a spectre stalked forth, or rather a monster crept, more fearful than human eye had ever yet beheld. And not with surer instinct does the tiger of the jungles, where this terrible pestilence was born,
catch the scent of blood upon the air, than did this invisible Destroyer, this fearful agent of Almighty Power, this tremendous Consequence of some Sufficient Cause, scent the tainted atmosphere of Europe
and turn Westward his devastating march. The millions of dead left in his path through Asia proved nothing. They were unarmed, ignorant, defenceless, unaided by science, undefended by art. The cholera
was to them inscrutable and irresistible as Azrael, the Angel of Death.
But it came to Europe and swept the halls of science as it had swept the Indian village and the Persian khan. It leaped as noise lessly and descended as destructively upon the population of many a high
towered, widepaved, purified, and disinfected city of the West as upon the Pariahs
of Tanjore and the filthy streets of Stamboul. In Vienna, Paris, London, the scenes of the great plague
were reenacted.
The sick man started in his bed The watcher leaped upon the floor At the cry, Bring out your dead, The cart is at the!door!
Was this the judgment of Almighty God? He would be bold who should say that it was; he would be
bolder who should say it was not. To Paris, at least, that European Babylon, how often have the further words of the prophet to the daughter of the Chaldaeans, the lady of kingdoms, been fulfilled? "Thy
wisdom and thy knowledge have perverted thee, and thou hast said in thy heart I am and none else beside me. Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know whence it riseth; and mischief

604/641
shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off; desolation shall come upon thee suddenly."
And as to London it looked like judgment, if it be true that the Asiatic cholera had its origin in English avarice and cruelty, as they suppose who trace it to the tax which Warren Hastings, when Governor
General of India, imposed on salt, thus cutting off its use from millions of the vegetableeating races of the East just as that disease whose spectral shadow lies always upon America's threshold, originated in
the avarice and cruelty of the slavetrade, translating the African coast fever to the congenial climate of the West Indies and Southern America the yellow fever of the former, and the vomito negro of the
latter.
But we should be slow to make inferences from our petty human logic to the ethics of the Almighty. Whatever the cruelty of the slavetrade, or the severity of slavery on the continents or islands of
America, we should still, in regard to its supposed consequences, be wiser, perhaps, to say with that great and simple Casuist Who gave the world the Christian religion: "Suppose ye that these Galileans
were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things or those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all the men that dwelt in
Jerusalem?"
Retribution bars retaliation, even in words. A city shattered, burned, destroyed, desolate, a land wasted, humiliated, made a desert and a wilderness, or wearing the thorny crown of humiliation and
subjugation, is invested with the sacred prerogatives and immunities of the dead. The base
human revenge of exultation at its fall and ruin should shrink back abashed in the presence of the
infinite Divine chastisement. "Forgiveness is wiser than revenge," our Freemasonry teaches us, "and it is better to love than to hate." Let him who sees in great calamities the hand of God, be silent, and fear
His judgments.
Men are great or small in stature as it pleases God. But their nature is great or small as it pleases themselves. Men are not born, some with great souls and some with little souls. One by taking thought
cannot add to his stature, but he can enlarge his soul. By an act of the will he can make himself a moral giant, or dwarf himself to a pigmy.
There are two natures in man, the higher and the lower, the great and the mean, the noble and the
ignoble; and he can and must, by his own voluntary act, identify himself with the one or with the other. Freemasonry is continual effort to exalt the nobler nature over the ignoble, the spiritual over the
material, the divine in man over the human. In this great effort and purpose the chivalric Degrees concur and cooperate with those that teach the magnificent lessons of morality and philosophy.

Magnanimity, mercy, clemency, a forgiving temper, are virtues indispensable to the character of a perfect Knight. When the low and evil principle in our nature says, "Do not give; reserve your
beneficence for impoverished friends, or at least unobjectionable strangers, Do not bestow it on successful enemies, friends only in virtue, of our misfortunes," the diviner principle whose voice spake
by the despised Galilean says, "Do good to them that hate you, for if ye love them (only) who love you, what reward have you? Do not publicans and sinners the same" that is, the taxgathers and wicked
oppressors, armed Romans and renegade Jews, whom ye count your enemies?
XXX. KNIGHT KADOSH
We often profit more by our enemies than by our friends. "We support ourselves only on that which resists, "and owe our success to opposition". The best friends of Masonry in America were the Anti
Masons of 1826, and at the same time they were its worst enemies. Men are but the automata of Providence, and it uses the demagogue, the fanatic, and the knave, a common trinity in Republics, as its
tools and instruments to effect that of which they do not dream, and which they imagine themselves commissioned to prevent.
The AntiMasons, traitors and perjurors some, and some mere political knaves, purified Masonry by
persecution, and so proved to be its benefactors; for that which is persecuted, grows. To them its present popularity is due, the cheapening of its Degrees, the invasion of its Lodges, that are no longer
Sanctuaries, but the multitude; its pomp and pageantry and overdone display.
An hundred years ago it had become known that the Kadosh were the Templars under a veil, and therefore the Degree was proscribed, and, ceasing to be worked, became a mere brief and formal
ceremony, under another name. Now, from the tomb in which after his murders he rotted, Clement the Fifth howls against the successors of his victims, in the Allocution of Pio Nono against the Free
Masons. The ghosts of the dead Templars haunt the Vatican and disturb the slumbers of the paralyzed Papacy, which, dreading the dead, shrieks out its excommunications and impotent anathemas against
the living. It is a declaration of war, and was needed to arouse apathy an inertness to action.
An enemy of the Templars shall tell us the secret of this Papal hostility against an Order that has existed for centuries in despite of its anathemas, and has its Sanctuaries and Asyla even in Rome.
It will be easy, as we read, to separate the false from the true, the audacious conjectures from the simple
facts.

"A power that ruled without antagonism and without concurrence, and consequently without control, proved fatal to the Sacerdotal Royalties; while the Republics, on the other hand, had perished by the
conflict of liberties and franchises, which, in the absence of all duty hierarchically sanctioned and enforced, had soon become mere tyrannies, rivals one of the other. To find a stable medium between
these two abysses, the idea of the Christian Hierophants was to create a society devoted to abnegation by solemn vows, protected by severe regulations; which should be recruited by initiation, and which,
sole depositary of the great religious and social secrets, should make Kings and Pontiffs, without exposing it to the corruptions of Power. In that was the secret of that kingdom of Jesus Christ, which,
without being of this world, would govern all its grandeurs.
"This idea presided at the foundation of the great religious orders, so often at war with the secular authorities, ecclesiastical or civil. Its realization was also the dream of the dissident sects of Gnostics
or Illuminati who pretended to connect their faith with the primitive tradition of the Christianity of Saint John. It at length became a menace for the Church and Society, when a rich and dissolute Order,
initiated in the mysterious doctrines of the Kabalah, seemed disposed to turn against legitimate authority the conservative principle of Hierarchy, and threatened the entire world with an immense
revolution.
"The Templars, whose history is so imperfectly known, were those terrible conspirators. In 1118, nine Knights Crusaders in the East, among whom were Geoffroi de SaintOmer and Hugues de Payens,
consecrated themselves to religion, and took an oath between the hands of the Patriarch of Constantinople, a See always secretly or openly hostile to that of Rome from the time of Photius. The
avowed object of the Templars was to protect the Christians who came to visit the Holy Places: their secret object was the rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon on the model prophesied by Ezekiel.
"This rebuilding, formally predicted by the Judaizing Mystics of the earlier ages, had become the
secret dream of the Patriarchs of the Orient. The Temple of Solomon, rebuilt and consecrated to the Catholic worship would become, in effect, the Metropolis of the Universe; the East would prevail over
the West, and the Patriarchs of Constantinople would possess themselves of the Papal Power.
"The Templars, or Poor FellowSoldiery of the Holy House of the Temple intended to be rebuilt, took as their models, in the Bible, the WarriorMasons of Zorobabel, who worked, holding the sword in one
hand and the trowel in the other. Therefore it was that the Sword and the Trowel were the insignia of the Templars, who subsequently, as will be seen, concealed themselves under the name of Brethren
Masons. [This name, Freres Macons in the French, adopted by way of secret reference to the Builders of the Second Temple, was corrupted in English into FreeMasons, as Pythagore de Crotone was into
Peter Gower of Groton in England. Kairum or Khurum (a name misrendered into Hiram) from an artificer in brass and other metals, became the Chief Builder of the Haikal Kadosh, the Holy House, of
the Temple, the 'Ieros Domos; and the words Bonai and Banaim yet appear in the Masonic Degrees,

meaning Builder and Builders.]
"The trowel of the Templars is quadruple, and the triangular plates of it are arranged in the form of a cross, making the Kabalistic pantacle known by the name of the Cross of the East. The Knight of the
East, and the Knight of the East and West, have in their titles secret allusions to the Templars of whom they were at first the successors.
"The secret thought of Hugues de Payens, in founding his Order, was not exactly to serve the ambition
of the Patriarchs of Constantinople. There existed at that period in the East a Sect of Johannite Christians, who claims to be the only true Initiates into the real mysteries of the religion of the Saviour.
The pretended to know the real history of Yesus the Anointed, and, adopting in part the Jewish traditions and the tales of the Talmud, they held that the facts recounted in the Evangels are but
allegories, the key of which Saint John gives, in saying that the world might be filled with the books that could be written upon the words and deeds of Jesus Christ; words which, they thought, would be
only a ridiculous exaggeration, if he were not speaking of an allegory and a legend, that might be varied and prolonged to infinity.
"The Johannites ascribed to Saint John the foundation of their Secret Church, and the Grand Pontiffs of
the Sect assumed the title of Christos, Anointed, or Consecrated, and claimed to have succeeded one another from Saint John by an uninterrupted succession of pontifical powers. He who, at the period of
the foundation of the Order of the Temple, claimed these imaginary prerogatives, was named Theoclet; he knew Hugues de Payens, he initiated him into the Mysteries and hopes of his pretended church, he
seduced him by the notions of Sovereign Priesthood and Supreme royalty, and finally designated him as his successor.
"Thus the Order of Knights of the Temple was at its very origin devoted to the cause of opposition to
the tiara of Rome and the crowns of Kings, and the Apostolate of Kabalistic Gnosticism was vested in its chiefs. For Saint John himself was the Father of the Gnostics, and the current translation of his
polemic against the heretical of his Sect and the pagans who denied that Christ was the Word, is throughout a misrepresentation, or misunderstanding at least, of the whole Spirit of that Evangel.
"The tendencies and tenets of the Order were enveloped in profound mystery, and it externally professed
the most perfect orthodoxy. The Chiefs alone knew the aim of the Order the Subalterns followed them without distrust.
"To acquire influence and wealth, then to intrigue, and at need to fight, to establish the Johannite or
Gnostic and Kabalistic dogma, were the object and means proposed to the initiated Bretheren. The Papacy and the rival monarchies, they said to them, are sold and bought in these days, become corrupt,

and tomorrow, perhaps, will destroy each other. All that will become the heritage of the Temple the World will soon come to us for its Sovereigns and Pontiffs. We shall constitute the equilibrium of the
Universe, and be rulers over the Masters of the World.
"The Templars, like all other Secret Orders and Associations, had two doctrines, one concealed and reserved for the Masters, which was Johannism; the other public, which was the Roman Catholic. Thus
they deceived the adversaries whom they sought to supplant. Hence FreeMasonry, vulgarly imagined to have begun with the Dionysian Architects or the German Stoneworkers, adopted Saint John the
Evangelist as one of its patrons, associating with him, in order not to arouse the suspicions of Rome, Saint John the Baptist, and thus covertly proclaiming itself the child of the Kabalah and Essenism
together."
[For the Johannism of the Adepts was the Kabalah of the earlier Gnostics, degenerating afterward into those heretical forms which Gnosticism developed, so that even Manes had his followers among them.
Many adopted his doctrines of the two Principles, the recollection of which is perpetuated by the handle of the dagger and the tesselated pavement or floor of the Lodge, stupidly called "the Indented Tessel,"
and represented by great hanging tassels, when it really means a tesserated floor (from the Latin "tessera") of white and black lozenges, with a necessarily denticulated or indented border or edging.
And wherever, in the higher Degrees, the two colors white and black, are in juxtaposition, the two Principles of Zoroaster and Manes are alluded to. With others the doctrine became a mystic Pantheism,
descended from that of the Brahmins, and even pushed to an idolatry of Nature and hatred of every revealed dogma.
[To all this the absurd reading of the established Church, taking literally the figurative, allegorical, and
mythical language of a collection of Oriental books of different ages, directly and inevitably led. The same result long after followed the folly of regarding the Hebrew books as if they had been written by
the unimaginative, hard, practical intellect of the England of James the First and the bigoted stolidity of Scottish Presbyterianism.]
"The better to succeed and win partisans, the Templars sympathized with regrets for dethroned creeds
and encouraged the hopes of new worships, promising to all liberty of conscience and a new orthodoxy that should be the synthesis of all the persecuted creeds."
[It is absurd to suppose that men of intellect adored a monstrous idol called Baphomet, or recognized
Mahomet as an inspired prophet. Their symbolism, invented ages before, to conceal what it was dangerous to avow, was of course misunderstood by those who were not adepts, and to their enemies
seemed to be pantheistic. The calf of gold, made by Aaron for the Israelites, was but one of the oxen under the laver of bronze, and the Karobim on the Propitiatory, misunderstood. The symbols of the

609/641
wise always become the idols of the ignorant multitude. What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indicated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high Degrees of FreeMasonry, and
by the symbols which only the Adepts understand.
[The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he
shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry. The whole body of the Royal and
Sacerdotal Art was hidden so carefully, centuries since, in the High Degrees, as that it is even yet impossible to solve many of the enigmas which they contain. It is well enough for the mass of those
called Masons, to imagine that all is contained in the Blue Degrees; and whoso attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain, and without any true reward violate his obligations as an Adept. Masonry is the
veritable Sphynx, buried to the head in the sands heaped round it by the ages.]
"The seeds of decay were sown in the Order of the Temple at its origin. Hypocrisy is a mortal disease. It had conceived a great work which it was incapable of executing, because it knew neither humility nor
personal abnegation, because Rome was then invincible, and because the later Chiefs of the Order did not comprehend its mission. Moreover, the Templars were in general uneducated, and capable only of
wielding the sword, with no qualifications for governing, and at need enchaining, that queen of the world called Opinion." [The doctrines of the Chiefs would, if expounded to the masses, have seemed to
them the babblings of folly. The symbols of the wise are the idols of the vulgar, or else as meaningless as the hieroglyphics of Egypt to the nomadic Arabs. There must always be a commonplace
interpretation for the mass of Initiates, of the symbols that are eloquent to the Adepts.]
"Hugues de Payens himself had not that keen and farsighted intellect nor that grandeur of purpose which afterward distinguished the military founder of another soldiery that became formidable to kings.
The Templars were unintelligent and therefore unsuccessful Jesuits.
"Their watchword was, to become wealthy, in order to buy the world. They became so, and in 1312 they possessed in Europe alone more than nine thousand seignories. Riches were the shoal on which they
were wrecked. They became insolent, and unwisely showed their contempt for the religious and social institutions which they aimed to overthrow. Their ambition was fatal to them. Their projects were
divined and prevented. [Rome, more intolerant of heresy than of vice and crime, came to fear the Order, and fear is always cruel. It has always deemed philososophical truth the most dangerous of
heresies, and has never been at a loss for a false accusation, by means of which to crush free thought.] Pope Clement V. and King Philip le Bel gave the signal to Europe, and the Templars, taken as it were in
an immense net, were arrested, disarmed, and cast into prison. Never was a Coup d' Etat accomplished with a more formidable concert of action. The whole world was struck with stupor, and eagerly waited
for the strange revelations of a process that was to echo through so many ages.

"It was impossible to unfold to the people the conspiracy of the Templars against the Thrones and the
Tiara. It was impossible to expose to them the doctrines of the Chiefs of the Order. [This would have been to initiate the multitude into the secrets of the Masters, and to have uplifted the veil of Isis.
Recourse was therefore had to the charge of magic, and denouncers and false witnesses were easily found. When the temporal and spiritual tyrannies unite to crush a victim they never want for
serviceable instruments.] The Templars were gravely accused of spitting upon Christ and denying God at their receptions, or gross obscenities, conversations with female devils, and the worship of a
monstrous idol.
"The end of the drama is well known, and how Jacques de Molai and his fellows perished in the flames. But before his execution, the Chief of the doomed Order organized and instituted what afterward came
to be called the Occult, Hermetic, or Scottish Masonry. In the gloom of his prison, the Grand Master created four Metropolitan Lodges, at Naples for the East, at Edinburg for the West, at Stockholm for the
North, and at Paris for the South." [The initials of his name, J..B.'.M.'. found in the same order in the first three Degrees, are but one of the many internal and cogent proofs that such was the origin of
modern FreeMasonry. The legend of Osiris was revived and adopted, to symbolize the destruction of the Order, and the resurrection of Khurum, slain in the body of the Temple, of Khurum Abai, the
Master as the martyr of fidelity to obligation, of Truth and Conscience, prophesied the restoration to life of the buried association.]
"The Pope and the King soon after perished in a strange and sudden manner. Squin de Florian, the
chief denouncer of the Order, died assassinated. In breaking the sword of the Templars, they made of it a poniard; and their proscribed trowels thenceforward built only tombs."
[The Order disappeared at once. Its estates and wealth were confiscated, and it seemed to have ceased
to exist. Nevertheless it lived, under other names and governed by unknown Chiefs, revealing itself only to those who, in passing through a series of Degrees, had proven themselves worthy to be
entrusted with the dangerous Secret. The modern Orders that style themselves Templars have assumed a name to which they have not the shadow of a title.]
"The Successors of the Ancient Adepts RoseCroix, abandoning by degrees the austere and hierarchial
Science of their Ancestors by initiation, became a Mystic Sect, uniting with many of the Templars, the dogmas of the two intermingling, and believed themselves to be the sole depositaries of the secrets of
the Gospel of St. John, seeing in its recitals an allegorical series of rites proper to complete the initiation.
"The Initiates, in fact, thought in the eighteenth century that their time had arrived, some to found a

new Hierarchy, others to overturn all authority, and to press down all summits of the Social Order under the level of Equality."
The mystical meanings of the Rose as a Symbol are to be looked for in the Kabalistic Commentaries on
the Canticles.
The Rose was for the Initiates the living and blooming symbol of the revelation of the harmonies of being. It was the emblem of beauty, life, love, and pleasure. Flamel, or the Book of the Jew Abraham,
made it the hieroglyphical sign of the accomplishment of the great Work. Such is the key of the Roman de la Rose. The Conquest of the Rose was the problem propounded to Science by Initiation, while
Religion was laboring to prepare and establish the universal triumph, exclusive and definitive, of the Cross.
To unite the Rose to the Cross, was the problem proposed by the High Initiation; and in fact the Occult
philosophy being the Universal Synthesis, ought to explain all the phenomena of Being. Religion, considered solely as a physiological fact, is the revelation and satisfaction of a necessity of souls. Its
existence is a scientific fact; to deny it, would be to deny humanity itself.
The RoseCroix Adepts respected the dominant, hierarchical, and revealed religion. Consequently they could no more be the enemies of the Papacy than of legitimate Monarchy; and if they conspired against
the Popes and Kings, it was because they considered them personally as apostates from duty and supreme favorers of anarchy.
What, in fact, is a despot, spiritual or temporal, but a crowned anarchist? One of the magnificent
pantacles that express the esoteric and unutterable part of Science, is a Rose of Light, in the centre of which a human form extends its arms in the form of a cross.
Commentaries and studies have been multiplied upon the Divine Comedy, the work of Dante, and yet
no one, so far as we know, has pointed out its especial character. The work of the great Ghibellin is a declaration of war against the Papacy, by bold revelations of the Mysteries. The Epic of Dante is
Johannite and Gnostic, an audacious application, like that of the Apocalypse, of the figures and numbers of the Kabalah to the Christian dogmas, and a secret negation of every thing absolute in these
dogmas. His journey through the supernatural worlds is accomplished like the initiation into the Mysteries of Eleusis and Thebes. He escapes from that gulf of Hell over the gate of which the sentence
of despair was written, by reversing the positions of his head and feet, that is to say, by accepting the direct opposite of the Catholic dogma: and then he reascends to the light, by using the Devil himself as
a monstrous ladder. Faust ascends to Heaven, by stepping on the head of the vanquished Mephistopheles. Hell is impassable for those only who know not how to turn back from it. We free

ourselves from its bondage by audacity.
His Hell is but a negative Purgatory. His Heaven is composed of a series of Kabalistic circles, divided by a cross, like the Pantacle of Ezekiel. In the centre of this cross blooms a rose, and we see the symbol
of the Adepts of the RoseCroix for the first time publicly expounded and almost categorically explained.
For the first time, because Guillaume de Lorris, who died in 1260, five years before the birth of
Alighieri, had not completed his "Roman de la Rose," which was continued by Chopinel, a half century afterward. One is astonished to discover that the Roman de la Rose and the Divina Commedia are two
opposite forms of one and the same work, initiation into independence of spirit, a satire on all contemporary institutions, and the allegorical formula of the great Secrets of the Society of the Roses
Croix.
The important manifestations of Occultism coincide with the period of the fall of the Templars; since Jean de Meung or Chopines, contemporary of the old age of Dante, flourished during the best years of
his life at the Court of Philippe le Bel. The Roman del la Rose is the Epic of old France. It is a profound book, under the form of levity, a revelation as learned as that of Apuleius, of the Mysteries of
Occultism. The Rose of Flamel, that of Jean de Meung, and that of Dante, grew on the same stem.
Swedenborg's system was nothing else than the Kabalah, minus the principle of the Hierarchy. It is the Temple, without the keystone and the foundation.
Cagliostro was the Agent of the Templars, and therefore wrote to the FreeMasons of London that the
time had come to begin the work of rebuilding the Temple of the Eternal. He had introduced into Masonry a new Rite called the Egyptian, and endeavored to resuscitate the mysterious worship of Isis.
The three letters L.'.P.'D.'. on his seal, were the initials of the words "Lilia pedibus destrue;" tread under the foot the Lilies [of France], and a Masonic medal of the sixteenth or seventeenth century has upon it
a sword cutting off the stalk of a lily, and the words "talem dabit ultio messem," such harvest revenge will give.
A Lodge inaugurated under the auspices of Rousseau, the fanatic of Geneva, became the centre of the
revolutionary movement in France, and a Prince of the bloodroyal went thither to swear the destruction of the successors of Philippe le Bel on the tomb of Jacques de Molai. The registers of the Order of
Templars attest that the Regent, the Duc d' Orleans, was Grand Master of that formidable Secret Society, and that his successors were the Duc de Maine, the Prince of BourbonConde, and the Duc de
CosseBrissac.

The Templars compromitted the King; they saved him from the rage of the People, to exasperate that
rage and bring on the catastrophe prepared for centuries; it was a scaffold that the vengeance of the Templars demanded. The secret movers of the French Revolution had sworn to overturn the Throne and
the Altar upon the Tomb of Jacques de Molai. When Louis XVI. was executed, half the work was done; and thenceforward the Army of the Temple was to direct all its efforts against the Pope.
Jacques de Molai and his companions were perhaps martyrs, but their avengers dishonored their
memory. Royalty was regenerated on the scaffold of Louis XVI, the Church triumphed in the captivity of Pius VI., carried a prisoner to Valence, and dying of fatigue and sorrow, but the successors of the
Ancient Knights of the Temple perished, overwhelmed in their fatal victory.

To hear patiently, to weigh deliberately and dispassionately, and to decide impartially; these are the chief duties of a Judge. After the lessons you have received, I need not further enlarge
upon them. You will be ever eloquently reminded of them by the furniture upon our Altar, and the decorations of the Tribunal.
The Holy Bible will remind you of your obligation; and that as you judge here below, so you will be
yourself judged hereafter, by One who has not to submit, like an earthly judge, to the sad necessity of inferring the motives, intentions, and purposes of men [of which all crime essentially consists] from the
uncertain and often unsafe testimony of their acts and words; as men in thick darkness grope their way, with hands outstretched before them; but before Whom
every thought, feeling, impulse, and intention of every soul that now is, or ever was, or ever will be on earth, is and ever will be through the whole infinite duration of eternity, present and
visible.
The Square and Compass, the Plumb and Level, are well known to you as a Mason. Upon you as a Judge, they peculiarly inculcate uprightness, impartiality, careful consideration of facts and

The peculiar and principal symbol of this Degree is the Tetractys of Pythagoras, suspended in the East, where ordinarily the sacred word or letter glitters, like it, representing the Deity. Its nine external points
form the triangle, the chief symbol in Masonry, with many of the meanings of which you are familiar.
To us, its three sides represent the three principal attributes of the Deity, which created, and now, as ever, support, uphold, and guide the Universe in its eternal movement; the three supports of the
Masonic Temple, itself an emblem of the Universe; Wisdom, or the Infinite Divine Intelligence; Strength, or Power, the Infinite Divine Will; and Beauty, or the Infinite Divine Harmony, the Eternal
Law, by virtue of which the infinite myriads of suns and worlds flash ever onward in their ceaseless revolutions, without clash or conflict, in the Infinite of space, and change and movement are the law of
all created existences.
To us, as Masonic Judges, the triangle figures forth the Pyramids, which, planted firmly as the everlasting hills, and accurately adjusted to the four cardinal points, defiant of all assaults of men and
time, teach us to stand firm and unshaken as they, when our feet are planted upon the solid truth.
It includes a multitude of geometrical figures, all having a deep significance to Masons. The triple triangle is peculiarly sacred, having ever been among all nations a symbol of the Deity. Prolonging all
the external lines of the Hexagon, which also it includes, we have six smaller triangles, whose bases cut each other in the central point of the Tetractys, itself always the symbol of the generative power of the
Universe, the Sun, Brahma, Osiris, Apollo, Bel, and the Deity Himself. Thus, too, we form twelve still smaller triangles, three times three of which compose the Tetractys itself.
I refrain from enumerating all the figures that you may trace within it, but one may not be passed
unnoticed. The Hexagon itself faintly images to us a cube, not visible at the first glance, and therefore the fit emblem of that faith in things invisible, most essential to salvation. The first perfect solid, and
reminding you of the cubical stone that sweated blood, and of that deposited by Enoch, it teaches justice, accuracy, and consistency.
The infinite divisibility of the triangle teaches the infinity of the Universe, of time, of space, and of the
Deity, as do the lines that, diverging from the common centre, ever increase their distance from each other as they are infinitely prolonged. As they may be infinite in number, so are the attributes of Deity

infinite; and as they emanate from onecentre and are projected into space, so the whole Universe has emanated from God.
Remember also, my Brother, that you have other duties to perform than those of a judge. You are to
inquire into and scrutinize carefully the work of the subordinate Bodies in Masonry. You are to see that recipients of the higher Degrees are not unnecessarily multiplied; that improper persons are carefully
excluded from membership, and that in their life and conversation Masons bear testimony to the excellence of our doctrines and the incalculable value of the institution itself. You are to inquire also
into your own heart and conduct, and keep careful watch over yourself, that you go not astray. If you harbour illwill and jealousy, if you are hospitable to intolerance and bigotry, and churlish to gentleness
and kind affections, opening wide your heart to one and closing its portals to the other, it is time for you to set in order your own temple, or else you wear in vain the name and insignia of a Mason, while yet
uninvested with the Masonic nature.
Everywhere in the world there is a natural law, that is, a constant mode of action, which seems to belong to the nature of things, to the constitution of the Universe. This fact is universal. In different
departments we call this mode of action by different names, as the law of Matter, the law of Mind, the law of Morals, and the like. We mean by this, a certain mode of action which belongs to the material,
mental, or moral forces, the mode in which commonly they are found to act, and in which it is their ideal to act always. The ideal laws of matter we know only from the fact that they are always obeyed. To
us the actual obedience is the only evidence of the ideal rule; for in respect to the conduct of the material world, the ideal and the actual are the same.
The laws of matter we learn only by observation and experience. Before experience of the fact, no man
could foretell that a body, falling toward the earth, would descend sixteen feet the first second, twice that the next, four times the third, and sixteen times the fourth. No mode of action in our consciousness
anticipates this rule of action in the outer world. The same is true of all the laws of matter. The ideal law is known because it is a fact. The law is imperative. It must be obeyed without hesitation. Laws of
crystallization, laws of proportion in chemical combination, neither in these nor in any other law of Nature is there any margin left for oscillation of disobedience. Only the primal will of God works in the
material world, and no secondary finite will.
There are no exceptions to the great general law of Attraction, which binds atom to atom in the body of a rotifier visible only by aid of a microscope, orb to orb, system to system; gives unity to the world of
things, and rounds these worlds of systems to a Universe. At first there seem to be exceptions to this law, as in growth and decomposition, in the repulsions of electricity; but at length all these are found to
be special cases of the one great law of attraction acting in various modes.

The variety of effect of this law at first surprises the senses; but in the end the unity of cause astonishes the cultivated mind. Looked at in reference to this globe, an earthquake is no more than a chink that
opens in a gardenwalk of a dry day in Summer. A sponge is porous, having small spaces between the solid parts; the solar system is only more porous, having larger room between the several orbs; the
Universe yet more so, with spaces between the systems, as small, compared with infinite space, as those between the atoms that compose the bulk of the smallest invisible animalcule, of which millions swim
in a drop of saltwater. The same attraction holds together the animalcule, the sponge, the system, and the Universe. Every particle of matter in that Universe is related to each and all the other particles; and
attraction is their common bond.
In the spiritual world, the world of human consciousness, there is also a law, an ideal mode of action for the spiritual forces of man. The law of Justice is as universal an one as the law of Attraction; though we
are very far from being able to reconcile all the phenomena of Nature with it. The lark has the same right in our view, to live, to sing, to dart at pleasure through the ambient atmosphere, as the hawk has to
ply his strong wings in the Summer sunshine and yet the hawk pounces on and devours the harmless lark, as it devours the worm, and as the worm devours the animalcule; and, so far as we know, there is
nowhere, in any future state of animal existence, any compensation for this apparent injustice. Among the bees, one rules, while the others obey some work, while others are idle. With the small ants, the
soldiers feed on the proceeds of the workmen's labour. The lion lies in wait for and devours the antelope that has apparently as good a right to life as he. Among men, some govern and others serve, capital
commands and labour obeys, and one race, superior in intellect, avails itself of the strong muscles of another that is inferior; and yet, for all this, no one impeaches the justice of God.
No doubt all these varied phenomena are consistent with one great law of justice; and the only
difficulty is that we do not, and no doubt we cannot, understand that law. It is very easy for some dreaming and visionary theorist to say that it is most evidently unjust for the lion to devour the deer,
and for the eagle to tear and eat the wren; but the trouble is, that we know of no other way, according to the frame, the constitution, and the organs which God has given them, in which the lion and the eagle
could manage to live at all. Our little measure of justice is not God's measure.
His justice does not require us to relieve the hard working millions of all labour, to emancipate the serf or slave, unfitted to be free, from all control.
No doubt, underneath all the little bubbles, which are the lives, the wishes, the wills, and the plans of
the two thousand millions or more of human beings on this earth (for bubbles they are, judging by the space and time they occupy in this great and ageoutlasting sea of humankind), no doubt, underneath
them all resides one and the same eternal force, which they shape into this or the other special form; and over all the same paternal Providence presides, keeping eternal watch over the little and the great,
and producing variety of effect from Unity of Force.

It is entirely true to say that justice is the constitution or fundamental law of the moral Universe, the law
of right, a rule of conduct for man (as it is for every other living creature), in all his moral relations. No doubt all human affairs (like all other affairs), must be subject to that as the law paramount; and what is
right agrees therewith and stands, while what is wrong conflicts with it and falls. The difficulty is that we ever erect our notions of what is right and just into the law of justice, and insist that God shall adopt
that as His law; instead of striving to learn by observation and reflection what His law is, and then believing that law to be consistent with His infinite justice, whether it corresponds with our limited
notion of justice, or does not so correspond. We are too wise in our own conceit, and ever strive to enact our own little notions into the Universal Laws of God.
It might be difficult for man to prove, even to his own satisfaction, how it is right or just for him to
subjugate the horse and ox to his service, giving them in return only their daily food, which God has spread out for them on all the green meadows and savannas of the world: or how it is just that we
should slay and eat the harmless deer that only crops the green herbage, the buds, and the young leaves, and drinks the freerunning water that God made common to all; or the gentle dove, the innocent kid,
the many other living things that so confidently trust to our protection; quite as difficult, perhaps, as to prove it just for one man's intellect or even his wealth to make another's strong arms his servants, for
daily wages or for a bare subsistence.
To find out this universal law of justice is one thing to undertake to measure off something with our own little tapeline, and call that God's law of justice, is another. The great general plan and system, and
the great general laws enacted by God, continually produce what to our limited notions is wrong and injustice, which hitherto men have been able to explain to their own satisfaction only by the hypothesis
of another existence in which all inequalities and injustices in this life will be remedied and compensated for. To our ideas of justice, it is very unjust that the child is made miserable for life by
deformity or organic disease, in consequence of the vices of its father; and yet that is part of the universal law. The ancients said that the child was punished for the sins of its father. We say that this its
deformity or disease is the consequence of its father's vices; but so far as concerns the question of justice or injustice, that is merely the change of a word.
It is very easy to lay down a broad, general principle, embodying our own idea of what is absolute
justice, and to insist that everything shall conform to that to say, "all human affairs must be subject to that as the law paramount; what is right agrees therewith and stands, what is wrong conflicts and falls.
Private cohesions of selflove, of friendship, or of patriotism, must all be subordinate to this universal gravitation toward the eternal right." The difficulty is that this Universe of necessities Godcreated, of
sequences of cause and effect, and of life evolved from death, this interminable succession and aggregate of cruelties, will not conform to any such absolute principle or arbitrary theory, no matter in
what sounding words and glittering phrases it may be embodied.

Impracticable rules in morals are always injurious; for as all men fall short of compliance with them,
they turn real virtues into imaginary offenses against a forged law. Justice as between man and man and as between man and the animals below him, is that which, under and according to the Godcreated
relations existing between them, and the whole aggregate of circumstances surrounding them, is fit and right and proper to be done, with a view to the general as well as to the individual interest. It is not a
theoretical principle by which the very relations that God has created and imposed on us are to be tried, and approved or condemned.
God has made this great system of the Universe, and enacted general laws for its government. Those
laws environ everything that lives with a mighty network of necessity. He chose to create the tiger with such organs that he cannot crop the grass, but must eat other flesh or starve. He has made man
carnivorous also; and some of the smallest birds are as much so as the tiger. In every step we take, in every breath we draw, is involved the destruction of a multitude of animate existences, each, no matter
how minute, as much a living creature as ourself. He has made necessary among mankind a division of labour, intellectual and moral. He has made necessary the varied relations of society and dependence,
of obedience and control.
What is thus made necessary cannot be unjust; for if it be, then God the great Lawgiver is Himself unjust. The evil to be avoided is, the legalization of injustice and wrong under the false plea of
necessity. Out of all the relations of life grow duties, as naturally grow and as undeniably, as the leaves grow upon the trees. If we have the right, created by God's law of necessity, to slay the lamb that we
may eat and live, we have no right to torture it in doing so, because that is in no wise necessary. We have the right to live, if we fairly can, by the legitimate exercise of our intellect, and hire or buy the
labour of the strong arms of others, to till our grounds, to dig in our mines, to toil in our manufactories; but we have no right to overwork or underpay them.
It is not only true that we may learn the moral law of justice, the law of right, by experience and
observation; but that God has given us a moral faculty, our conscience, which is able to perceive this law directly and immediately, by intuitive perception of it; and it is true that man has in his nature a rule
of conduct higher than what he has ever yet come up to, an ideal of nature that shames his actual of history; because man has ever been prone to make necessity, his own necessity, the necessities of
society, a plea for injustice. But this notion must not be pushed too far for if we substitute this ideality for actuality, then it is equally true that we have within us an ideal rule of right and wrong, to which
God Himself in His government of the world has never come, and against which He (we say it reverentially) every day offends. We detest the tiger and the wolf for the rapacity and love of blood
which are their nature; we revolt against the law by which the crooked limbs and diseased organism of the child are the fruits of the father's vices; we even think that a God Omnipotent and Omniscient ought
to have permitted no pain, no poverty, no servitude; our ideal of justice is more lofty than the actualities of God. It is well, as all else is well. He has given us that moral sense for wise and beneficent purposes.

We accept it as a significant proof of the inherent loftiness of human nature, that it can entertain an ideal so exalted; and should strive to attain it, as far as we can do so consistently with the relations
which He has created, and the circum.stances which surround us and hold us captive.
If we faithfully use this faculty of conscience; if, applying it to the existing relations and circumstances, we develop it and all its kindred powers, and so deduce the duties that out of these relations and those
circumstances, and limited and qualified by them, arise and become obligatory upon us, then we learn justice, the law of right, the divine rule of conduct for human life. But if we undertake to define and
settle "the mode of action that belongs to the infinitely perfect nature of God," and so set up any ideal rule, beyond all human reach, we soon come to judge and condemn His work and the relations which it
has pleased Him in His infinite wisdom to create.
A sense of justice belongs to human nature, and is a part of it. Men find a deep, permanent, and instinctive delight in justice, not only in the outward effects, but in the inward cause, and by their nature
love this law of right, this reasonable rule of conduct, this justice, with a deep and abiding love. Justice is the object of the conscience, and fits it as light fits the eye and truth the mind.
Justice keeps just relations between men. It holds the balance between nation and nation, between a
man and his family, tribe, nation, and race, so that his absolute rights and theirs do not interfere, nor their ultimate interests ever clash, nor the eternal interests of the one prove antagonistic to those of all
or of any other one. This we must believe, if we believe that God is just. We must do justice to all, and demand it of all; it is a universal human debt, a universal human claim. But we may err greatly in
defining what that justice is. The temporary interests, and what to human view are the rights, of men, do often interfere and clash.
The lifeinterests of the individual often conflict with the permanent interests and welfare of society;
and what may seem to be the natural rights of one class or race, with those of another.
It is not true to say that "one man, however little, must not be sacrificed to another, however great, to a majority, or to all men." That is not only a fallacy, but a most dangerous one. Often one man and many
men must be sacrificed, in the ordinary sense of the term, to the interest of the many. It is a comfortable fallacy to the selfish; for if they cannot, by the law of justice, be sacrificed for the common good, then
their country has no right to demand of them selfsacrifice; and he is a fool who lays down his life, or sacrifices his estate, or even his luxuries, to insure the safety or prosperity of his country. According to
that doctrine, Curtius was a fool, and Leonidas an idiot; and to die for one's country is no longer beautiful and glorious, but a mere absurdity.
Then it is no longer to be asked that the common soldier shall receive in his bosom the sword or

bayonetthrust which otherwise would let out the life of the great commander on whose fate hang the liberties of his country, and the welfare of millions yet unborn.
On the contrary, it is certain that necessity rules in all the affairs of men, and that the interest and even
the life of one man must often be sacrificed to the interest and welfare of his country. Some must ever lead the forlorn hope: the missionary must go among savages, bearing his life in his hand; the physician
must expose himself to pestilence for the sake of others; the sailor, in the frail boat upon the wide ocean, escaped from the foundering or burning ship, must step calmly into the hungry waters, if the
lives of the passengers can be saved only by the sacrifice of his own; the pilot must stand firm at the wheel, and let the flames scorch away his own life to insure the common safety of those whom the
doomed vessel bears.
The mass of men are always looking for what is just. All the vast machinery which makes up a State, a world of States, is, on the part of the people, an attempt to organize, not that ideal justice which finds
fault with God's ordinances, but that practical justice which may be attained in the actual organization of the world. The minute and wideextending civil machinery which makes up the law and the courts,
with all their officers and implements, on the part of mankind, is chiefly an effort to reduce to practice the theory of right. Constitutions are made to establish justice; the decisions of courts are reported to
help us judge more wisely in time to come. The nation aims to get together the most nearly just men in the State, that they may incorporate into statutes their aggregate sense of what is right. The people wish
law to be embodied justice, administered without passion. Even in the wildest ages there has been a wild popular justice, but always mixed with passion and administered in hate; for justice takes a rude
form with rude men, and becomes less mixed with hate and passion in more civilized communities. Every progressive State revises its statutes and revolutionizes its constitution from time to time, seeking
to come closer to the utmost possible practical justice and right; and sometimes, following theorists and dreamers in their adoration for the ideal, by erecting into law positive principle of theoretical right,
works practical injustice, and then has to retrace its steps.
In literature men always look for practical justice, and desire that virtue should have its own reward, and vice its appropriate punishment. They are ever on the side of justice and humanity; and the majority of
them have an ideal justice, better than the things about them, juster than the law; for the law is ever imperfect, not attaining even to the utmost practicable degree of perfection; and no man is as just as his
own idea of possible and practicable justice. His passions and his necessities ever cause him to sink below his own ideal. The ideal justice which men ever look up to and strive to rise toward, is true; but it
will not be realized in this world. Yet we must approach as near to it as practicable, as we should do toward that ideal democracy that "now floats before the eyes of earnest and religious men, fairer than
the Republic of Plato, or More's Utopia, or the Golden Age of fabled memory," only taking care that we do not, in striving to reach and ascend to the impossible ideal, neglect to seize upon and hold fast to the
possible actual. To aim at the best, but be content with the best possible, is the only true wisdom. To insist on the absolute right, and throw out of the calculation the important and all controlling

621/641
element of necessity, is the folly of a mere dreamer.
In a world inhabited by men with bodies, and necessarily with bodily wants and animal passions, the time will never come when there will be no want, no oppression, nor servitude, no fear of man no fear
of God, but only Love. That can never be while there are inferior intellect, indulgence in low vice, improvidence, indolence, awful visitations of pestilence and war and famine, earthquake and volcano,
that must of necessity cause men to want, and serve, and suffer and fear.
But still the ploughshare of justice is ever drawn through and through the field of the world, uprooting the savage plants. Ever we see a continual and progressive triumph of the right. The injustice of
England lost her America, the fairest jewel of her crown. The injustice of Napoleon bore him to the ground more than the snows of Russia did, and exiled him to a barren rock there to pine away and die,
his life a warning to bid mankind be just.
We intuitively understand what justice is, better than we can depict it. What it is in a given case depends so much on circumstances, that definitions of it are wholly deceitful. Often it would be unjust to society
to do what would, in the absence of that consideration, be pronounced just to the individual. General propositions of man's right to this or that are ever fallacious and not infrequently it would be most
unjust to the individual himself to do for him what the theorist, as a general proposition, would say was right and his due.
We should ever do unto others what, under the same circumstances, we ought to wish, and should have
the right to wish they should do unto us. There are many cases, cases constantly occurring, where one man must take care of himself, in preference to another, as where two struggle for the possession of a
plank that will save one, but cannot uphold both; or where, assailed, he can save his own life only by slaying his adversary. So one must prefer the safety of his country to the lives of her enemies; and
sometimes, to insure it, to those of her own innocent citizens. The retreating general may cut away a bridge behind him, to delay pursuit and save the main body of his army, though he thereby surrenders a
detachment, a battalion, or even a corps of his own force to certain destruction.
These are not departures from justice; though, like other instances where the injury or death of the individual is the safety of the many, where the interest of one individual, class, or race is
postponed to that of the public, or of the superior race, they may infringe some dreamer's ideal rule of justice. But every departure from real, practical justice is no doubt attended with loss to the unjust man,
though the loss is not reported to the public.
Injustice, public or private, like every other sin and wrong, is inevitably followed by its consequences.

The selfish, the grasping, the inhuman, the fraudulently unjust, the ungenerous employer, and the cruel master, are detested by the great popular heart; while the kind master, the liberal employer, the
generous, the humane, and the just have the good opinion of all men, and even envy is a tribute to their virtues. Men honour all who stand up for truth and right, and never shrink. The world builds
monuments to its patriots. Four great statesmen, organizers of the right, embalmed in stone, look down upon the lawgivers of France as they pass to their hall of legislation, silent orators to tell how nations
love the just. How we revere the marble lineaments of those just judges, Jay and Marshall, that look so calmly toward the living Bench of the Supreme Court of the United States! What a monument
Washington has built in the heart of America and all the world, not because he dreamed of an impracticable ideal justice, but by his constant effort to be practically just !
But necessity alone, and the greatest good of the greatest number, can legitimately interfere with the
dominion of absolute and ideal justice. Government should not foster the strong at the expense of the weak, nor protect the capitalist and tax the labourer. The powerful should not seek a monopoly of
development and enjoyment; not prudence only and the expedient for today should be appealed to by statesmen, but conscience and the right; justice should not be forgotten in looking at interest, nor
political morality neglected for political economy, we should not have national housekeeping instead of national organization on the basis of right.
We may well differ as to the abstract right of many things; for every such question has many sides, and
few men look at all of them, many only at one. But we all readily recognize cruelty, unfairness, inhumanity, partiality, overreaching, harddealing, by their ugly and familiar lineaments, and in order
to know and to hate and despise them, we do not need to sit as a Court of Errors and Appeals to revise and reverse God's Providences.
There are certainly great evils of civilization at this day, and many questions of humanity long
adjourned and put off. The hideous aspect of pauperism, the debasement and vice in our cities, tell us by their eloquent silence or in inarticulate mutterings, that the rich and the powerful and the intellectual
do not do their duty by the poor, the feeble, and the ignorant; and every wretched woman who lives, Heaven scarce knows how, by making shirts at sixpence each, attests the injustice and inhumanity of
man. There are cruelties to slaves, and worse cruelties to animals, each disgraceful to their perpetrators, and equally unwarranted by the lawful relation of control and dependence which it has pleased God to
create.
A sentence is written against all that is unjust, written by God in the nature of man and in the nature of the Universe, because it is in the nature of the Infinite God. Fidelity to your faculties, trust in their
convictions, that is justice to yourself; a life in obedience thereto, that is justice toward men. No wrong is really successful. The gain of injustice is a loss, its pleasure suffering. Iniquity often seems to
prosper, but its success is its defeat and shame. After a long while, the day of reckoning ever comes, to

nation as to individual. The knave deceives himself. The miser, starving his brother's body, starves also his own soul, and at death shall creep out of his great estate of injustice, poor and naked and miserable.
Whoso escapes a duty avoids a gain. Outward judgment often fails, inward justice never. Let a man try to love the wrong and to do the wrong, it is eating stones and not bread, the swift feet of justice are
upon him, following with woolen tread, and her iron hands are round his neck. No man can escape from this, any more than from himself. Justice is the angel of God that flies from East to West; and where she
stoops her broad wings, it is to bring the counsel of God, and feed mankind with angel's bread.
We cannot understand the moral Universe. The arc is a long one, and our eyes reach but a little way; we cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; but we can divine it by
conscience, and we surely know that it bends toward justice.
Justice will not fail, though wickedness appears strong, and has on its side the armies and thrones of power, the riches and the glory of the world, and though poor men crouch down in despair. Justice will
not fail and perish out from the world of men nor will what is really wrong and contrary to God's real law of justice continually endure. The Power, the Wisdom, and the Justice of God are on the side of
every just thought, and it cannot fail, any more than God Himself can perish.
In human affairs, the justice of God must work by human means. Men are the instruments of God's principles; our morality is the instrument of His justice, which, incomprehensible to us, seems to our
short vision often to work injustice. But will at some time still the oppressor's brutal laugh. Justice is the rule of conduct written in the nature of mankind. We may, in our daily life, in house or field or
shop, in the office or in the court, help to prepare the way for the commonwealth of justice which is slowly, but, we would fain hope, surely approaching. All the justice we mature will bless us here and
hereafter, and at our death we shall leave it added to the common store of humankind. And every Mason who, content to do that which is possible and practicable, does and enforces justice, may help
deepen the channel of human morality in which God's justice runs; and so the wrecks of evil that now check and obstruct the stream may the sooner be swept out and borne away by the resistless tide of
Omnipotent Right. Let us, my Brother, in this as in all else, endeavour always to perform the duties of a good Mason and a good man.
XXXII. SUBLIME PRINCE OF THE ROYAL SECRET
[Master of Royal Secret]
The Occult Science of the Ancient Magi was concealed under the shadows of the Ancient Mysteries. It was imperfectly revealed or rather disfigured by the Gnostics. It is guessed at under the obscurities that
cover the pretended crimes of the Templars and it is found enveloped in enigmas that seem

624/641
impenetrable, in the Rites of the Highest Masonry.
Magism was the Science of Abraham and Orpheus, of Confucius and Zoroaster. It was the dogmas of this Science that were engraven on the tables of stone by Hanoch and Trismegistus. Moses purified and
reveiled them, for that is the meaning of the word reveal. He covered them with a new veil, when he made of the Holy Kabalah the exclusive heritage of the people of Israel and the inviolable Secret of its
priests. The Mysteries of Thebes and Eleusis preserved among the nations some symbols of it, already altered and the mysterious key whereof was lost among the instruments of an evergrowing superstition.
Jerusalem, the murderess of her prophets and so often prostituted to the false gods of the Syrians and Babylonians, had at length in its turn lost the Holy Word, when a Prophet announced to the Magi by the
consecrated Star of Initiation, came to rend asunder the worn veil of the old Temple, in order to give the Church a new tissue of legends and symbols, that still and ever conceals from the Profane and ever
preserves to the Elect the same truths.
It was the remembrance of this scientific and religious Absolute, of this doctrine that is summed up in a word, of this Word, in fine, alternately lost and found again, that was transmitted to the Elect of all the
Ancient Initiations. It was this same remembrance, preserved, or perhaps profaned in the celebrated Order of the Templars, that became for all the secret associations, of the RoseCroix, of the Illuminati
and of the Hermetic Freemasons, the reason of their strange rites, of their signs more or less conventional and above all, of their mutual devotedness and of their power.
The Gnostics caused the Gnosis to be proscribed by the Christians, and the official Sanctuary was
closed against the high initiation. Thus the Hierarchy of Knowledge was compromitted by the violences of usurping ignorance and the disorders of the Sanctuary are reproduced in the State; for always,
willingly or unwillingly, the King is sustained by the Priest and it is from the eternal Sanctuary of the Divine instruction that the Powers of the Earth, to insure themselves durability, must receive their
consecration and their force.
The Hermetic Science of the early Christian ages, cultivated also by Geber, Alfarabius and others of the Arabs, studied by the Chiefs of the Templars and embodied in certain symbols of the higher Degrees of
Freemasonry, may be accurately defined as the Kabalah in active realization or the Magic of Works. It has three analogous Degrees, religious, philosophical and
physical realization.
Its religious realization is the durable foundation of the true Empire and the true Priesthood that rule in the realm of human intellect. Its philosophical realization is the establishment of absolute Doctrine,
known in all times as the "Holy Doctrine" and of which PLUTARCH, in the Treatise "de Iside et Osiride," speaks at large but mysteriously and of a Hierarchical instruction to secure the uninterrupted

succession of Adepts among the Initiates. Its physical realization is the discovery and application, in the Microcosm, or Little World of the creative law that incessantly peoples the great Universe.
Measure a corner of the Creation and multiply that space in proportional progression and the entire
Infinite will multiply its circles filled with universes, which will pass in proportional segments between the ideal and elongating branches of your Compass. Now suppose that from any point whatever of the
Infinite above you a hand holds another Compass or a Square, the lines of the Celestial triangle will necessarily meet those of the Compass of Science, to form the Mysterious Star of Solomon.
All hypotheses scientifically probable are the last gleams of the twilight of knowledge, or its last
shadows. Faith begins where Reason sinks exhausted. Beyond the human Reason is the Divine Reason, to our feebleness the great Absurdity, the Infinite Absurd, which confounds us and which we believe.
For the Master, the Compass of Faith is above the Square of Reason; but both rest upon the Holy Scriptures and combine to form the Blazing Star of Truth.
All eyes do not see alike. Even the visible creation is not, for all who look upon it, of one form and one
color. Our brain is a book printed within and without, and the two writings are, with all men, more or less confused.
The primary tradition of the single revelation has been preserved under the name of the "Kabalah," by
the Priesthood of Israel. The Kabalistic doctrine, which was also the dogma of the Magi and of Hermes, is contained in the Sepher Yetsairah, the Sohar and the Talmud. According to that doctrine, the
Absolute is the Being, in which The Word Is, the Word that is the utterance and expression of being and life.
Magic is that which it is; it is by itself, like the mathematics; for it is the exact and absolute science of
Nature and its laws.
Magic is the science of the Ancient Magi and the Christian religion, which has imposed silence on the lying oracles, and put an end to the prestiges of the false Gods, itself reveres those Magi who came
from the East, guided by a Star, to adore the Saviour of the world in His cradle.
Tradition also gives these Magi the title of "Kings" because initiation into Magism constitutes a genuine royalty and because the grand art of the Magi is styled by all the Adepts, "The Royal Art" or
the Holy Realm or Empire, Sanctum Regnum.

The Star which guided them is that same Blazing Star, the image whereof we find in all initiations. To the Alchemists it is the sign of the Quintessence; to the Magists, the Grand Arcanum; to the Kabalists,
the Sacred Pentagram. The study of this Pentagram could not but lead the Magi to the knowledge of the New Name which was about to raise itself above all names and cause all creatures capable of adoration
to bend the knee.
Magic unites in one and the same science, whatsoever Philosophy can possess that is most certain and Religion of the Infallible and the Eternal. It perfectly and incontestably reconciles these two terms that
at first blush seem so opposed to each other; faith and reason, science and creed, authority and liberty.
It supplies the human mind with an instrument of philosophical and religious certainty, exact as the mathematics, and accounting for the infallibility of the mathematics themselves.
Thus there is an Absolute, in the matters of the Intelligence and of Faith. The Supreme Reason has not
left the gleams of the human understanding to vacillate at hazard. There is an incontestable verity, there is an infallible method of knowing this verity and by the knowledge of it, those who accept it as a rule
may give their will a sovereign power that will make them the masters of all inferior things and of all errant spirits; that is to say, will make them the Arbiters and Kings of the World.
Science has its nights and its dawns, because it gives the intellectual world a life which has its regulated
movements and its progressive phases. It is with Truths, as with the luminous rays: nothing of what is concealed is lost; but also, nothing of what is discovered is absolutely new. God has been pleased to
give to Science, which is the reflection of His Glory, the Seal of His Eternity.
It is not in the books of the Philosophers, but in the religious symbolism of the Ancients, that we must look for the footprints of Science and rediscover the Mysteries of Knowledge. The Priests of Egypt
knew, better than we do, the laws of movement and of life. They knew how to temper or intensify action by reaction and readily foresaw the realization of these effects, the causes of which they had
determined. The Columns of Seth, Enoch, Solomon and Hercules have symbolized in the Magian traditions this universal law of the Equilibrium; and the Science of the Equilibrium or balancing of
Forces had led the Initiates to that of the universal gravitation around the centres of Life, Heat and Light.
Thales and Pythagoras learned in the Sanctuaries of Egypt that the Earth revolved around the Sun; but
they did not attempt to make this generally known, because to do so it would have been necessary to reveal one of the great Secrets of the Temple, that double law of attraction and radiation or of sympathy
and antipathy, of fixedness and movement, which is the principle of Creation, and the perpetual cause of life. This Truth was ridiculed by the Christian Lactantius, as it was long after sought to be proven a

falsehood by persecution, by Papal Rome.
So the philosophers reasoned while the Priests, without replying to them or even smiling at their errors, wrote, in those Hieroglyphics that created all dogmas and all poetry, the Secrets of the Truth.
When Truth comes into the world, the Star of Knowledge advises the Magi of it and they hasten to
adore the Infant who creates the Future. It is by means of the Intelligence of the Hierarchy and the practice of obedience, that one obtains Initiation. If the Rulers have the Divine Right to govern, the true
Initiate will cheerfully obey.
The orthodox traditions were carried from Chaldea by Abraham. They reigned in Egypt in the time of Joseph, together with the knowledge of the True God. Moses carried Orthodoxy out of Egypt, and in
the Secret Traditions of the Kabalah we find a Theology entire, perfect, unique, like that which in Christianity is most grand and best explained by the Fathers and the Doctors, the whole with a
consistency and a harmoniousness which it is not as yet given to the world to comprehend. The Sohar, which is the Key of the Holy Books, opens also all the depths and lights, all the obscurities of the
Ancient Mythologies and of the Sciences originally concealed in the Sanctuaries. It is true that the Secret of this Key must be known, to enable one to make use of it and that for even the most penetrating
intellects, not initiated in this Secret, the Sohar is absolutely incomprehensible and almost illegible.
The Secret of the Occult Sciences is that of Nature itself, the Secret of the generation of the Angels and Worlds, that of the Omnipotence of God.
"Ye shall be like the Elohim, knowing good and evil" had the Serpent of Genesis said; and the Tree of
Knowledge became the Tree of Death.
For six thousand years the Martyrs of Knowledge toil and die at the foot of this tree, that it may again become the Tree of Life.
The Absolute sought for unsuccessfully by the insensate and found by the Sages, is the TRUTH, the
REALITY and the REASON of the universal equilibrium!
Equilibrium is the Harmony that results from the analogy of Contraries.
Until now, Humanity has been endeavoring to stand on one foot; sometimes on one, sometimes on the

other.
Civilizations have risen and perished, either by the anarchical insanity of Despotism, or by the despotic anarchy of Revolt.
To organize Anarchy, is the problem which the revolutionists have and will eternally have to resolve. It
is the rock of Sisyphus that will always fall back upon them. To exist a single instant, they are and always will be by fatality reduced to improvise a despotism without other reason of existence than
necessity, and which, consequently, is violent and blind as Necessity. We escape from the harmonious monarchy of Reason, only to fall under the irregular dictatorship of Folly.
Sometimes superstitious enthusiasms, sometimes the miserable calculations of the materialist instinct
have led astray the nations and God at last urges the world on toward believing Reason and reasonable Beliefs.
We have had prophets enough without philosophy and philosophers without religion; the blind believers
and the sceptics resemble each other and are as far the one as the other from the eternal salvation.
In the chaos of universal doubt and of the conflicts of Reason and Faith, the great men and Seers have been but infirm and morbid artists, seeking the beauideal at the risk and peril of their reason and life.
Living only in the hope to be crowned, they are the first to do what Pythagoras in so touching a manner
prohibits in his admirable Symbols; they rend crowns, and tread them under foot.
Light is the equilibrium of Shadow and Lucidity. Movement is the equilibrium of Inertia and Activity. Authority is the equilibrium of Liberty and Power. Wisdom is equilibrium in the Thoughts, which are
the scintillations and rays of the Intellect. Virtue is equilibrium in the Affections. Beauty is harmonious proportion in Forms. The beautiful lives are the accurate ones, and the magnificences of Nature are an
algebra of graces and splendors. Everything just is beautiful; everything beautiful ought to be just.
There is, in fact, no Nothing, no void Emptiness, in the Universe. From the upper or outer surface of our atmosphere to that of the Sun and to those of the Planets and remote Stars, in different directions,
Science has for hundreds of centuries imagined that there was simple, void, empty Space. Comparing finite knowledge with the Infinite, the Philosophers know little more than the apes! In all that "void"
space are the Infinite Forces of God, acting in an infinite variety of directions, back and forth and never for an instant inactive. In all of it, active through the whole of its Infinity, is the Light that is the Visible

Manifestation of God. The earth and every other planet and sphere that is not a Centre of Light, carries its cone of shadow with it as it flies and flashes round in its orbit; but the darkness has no home in the
Universe. To illuminate the sphere on one side, is to project a cone of darkness on the other and Error also is the Shadow of the Truth with which God illuminates the Soul.
In all that "Void" also is the Mysterious and ever Active Electricity and Heat and the Omnipresent
Ether. At the will of God the Invisible becomes Visible. Two invisible gases, combined by the action of a Force of God, and compressed, become and remain the water that fills the great basins of the seas,
flows in the rivers and rivulets, leaps forth from the rocks or springs, drops upon the earth in rains, or whitens it with snows and bridges the Danubes with ice, or gathers in vast reservoirs in the earth's
bosom. God manifested fills all the extension that we foolishly call Empty Space and the Void.
And everywhere in the Universe, what we call life and Movement results from a continual conflict of Forces or Impulses. Whenever that active antagonism ceases, the immobility and inertia, which are
Death, result.
If, says the Kabalah, the Justice of God, which is Severity or the Female, alone reigned, creation of imperfect beings such as man would from the beginning have been impossible, because Sin being
congenital with Humanity, the Infinite Justice, measuring the Sin by the Infinity of the God offended against, must have annihilated Humanity at the instant of its creation and not only Humanity but the
Angels, since these also, like all created by God and less than perfect, are sinful. Nothing imperfect would have been possible. If, on the other hand, the Mercy or Benignity of God, the Male, were in no
wise counteracted, Sin would go unpunished, and the Universe fall into a chaos of corruption.
Let God but repeal a single principle or law of chemical attraction or sympathy and the antagonistic forces equilibrated in matter, released from constraint, would instantaneously expand all that we term
matter into impalpable and invisible gases, such as water or steam is, when, confined in a cylinder and subjected to an immense degree of that mysterious force of the Deity which we call "heat" it is by its
expansion released.
Incessantly the great currents and rivers of air flow and rush and roll from the equator to the frozen polar regions and back from these to the torrid equatorial realms. Necessarily incident to these great,
immense, equilibrated and beneficent movements, caused by the antagonism of equatorial heat and polar cold, are the typhoons, tornadoes, and cyclones that result from conflicts between the rushing
currents. These and the benign tradewinds result from the same great law. God is omnipotent; but effects without causes are impossible and these effects cannot but sometimes be evil. The fire would
not warm, if it could not also burn, the human flesh. The most virulent poisons are the most sovereign remedies, when given in due proportion. The Evil is the shadow of the Good, and inseparable from it.

The Divine Wisdom limits by equipoise the Omnipotence of the Divine Will or Power, and the result is
Beauty or Harmony. The arch rests not on a single column, but springs from one on either side. So is it also with the Divine Justice and Mercy, and with the Human Reason and Human Faith.
That purely scholastic Theology, issue of the Categories of Aristotle and of the Sentences of Peter
Lombard, that logic of the syllogism which argues instead of reasoning, and finds a response to every thing by subtilizing on terms, wholly ignored the Kabalastic dogma and wandered off into the drear
vacuity of darkness. It was less a philosophy or a wisdom than a philosophical automaton, replying by means of springs, and uncoiling its theses like a wheeled movement. It was not the human verb but the
monotonous cry of a machine, the inanimate speech of an Android. It was the fatal precision of mechanism, instead of a free application of rational necessities. ST THOMAS AQUINAS crushed with
a single blow all this scaffolding of words built one upon the other, by proclaiming the eternal Empire of Reason, in that magnificent sentence, "A thing is not just because GOD wills it, but GOD wills it
because it is just". The proximate consequence of this proposition, arguing from the greater to the less, was this: "A thing is not true because ARISTOTLE has said it; but ARISTOTLE could not reasonably
say it unless it was true. Seek then, first of, all, the TRUTH and JUSTICE, and the Science of ARISTOTLE will be given you in addition".
It is the fine dream of the greatest of the Poets, that Hell, become useless, is to be closed at length, by
the aggrandizement of Heaven; that the problem of Evil is to receive its final solution, and Good alone, necessary and triumphant, is to reign in Eternity. So the Persian dogma taught that AHRIMAN and his
subordinate ministers of Evil were at last, by means of a Redeemer and Mediator, to be reconciled with Deity and all Evil to end. But unfortunately, the philosopher forgets all the laws of equilibrium and
seeks to absorb the Light in a splendor without shadow, and movement in an absolute repose that would be the cessation of life. So long as there shall be a visible light, there will be a shadow proportional to
this Light and whatever is illuminated will cast its cone of shadow. Repose will never be happiness, if it is not balanced by an analogous and contrary movement. This is the immutable law of Nature, the
Eternal Will of the JUSTICE which is GOD.
The same reason necessitates Evil and Sorrow in Humanity which renders indispensable the bitterness of the waters of the seas. Here also, Harmony can result only from the analogy of contraries, and what
is above exists by reason of what is below. It is the depth that determines the height; and if the valleys are filled up, the mountains disappear. So, if the shadows are effaced, the Light is annulled, which is
only visible by the graduated contrast of gloom and splendor and universal obscurity will be produced by an immense dazzling. Even the colors in the Light only exists by the presence of the shadow. It is the
threefold alliance of the day and night, the luminous image of the dogma, the Light made Shadow, as the Saviour is the Logos made man and all this reposes on the same law, the primary law of creation,
the single and absolute law of Nature, that of the distinction and harmonious ponderation of the contrary forces in the universal equipoise.

The two great columns of the Temple that symbolizes the Universe are Necessity, or the omnipotent
Will of God, which nothing can disobey and Liberty, or the freewill of His creatures. Apparently and to our human reason antagonistic, the same Reason is not incapable of comprehending how they can be
in equipoise. The Infinite Power and Wisdom could so plan the Universe and the Infinite Succession of things as to leave man free to act and foreseeing what each would at every instant think and do, to make
of the free will and free action of each an instrument to aid in effecting its general purpose. For even a man, foreseeing that another will do a certain act, and in no wise controlling or even influencing him
may use that action as an instrument to effect his own purposes.
The Infinite Wisdom of God foresees what each will do and uses it as an instrument, by the exertion of His Infinite Power, which yet does not control the Human action so as to annihilate its freedom The
result is Harmony, the third column that upholds the Lodge. The same Harmony results from the equipoise of Necessity and Liberty. The will of God is not for an instant defeated nor thwarted, and this
is the Divine Victory and yet He does not tempt nor constrain men to do Evil and thus His Infinite Glory is unimpaired. The result is Stability, Cohesion, and Permanence in the Universe, and undivided
Dominion and Autocracy in the Deity. And these, Victory, Glory, Stability, and Dominion, are the last four Sephiroth of the Kabalah.
I AM, God said to Moses, that which Is, Was and Shall forever Be. But the Very God, in His
unmanifested Essence, conceived of as not yet having created and as Alone, has no Name. Such was the doctrine of all the ancient Sages and it is so expressly declared in the Kabalah. is the Name of the
Deity manifested in a single act, that of Creation and containing within Himself, in idea and actuality, the whole Universe, to be invested with form and be materially developed during the eternal succession
of ages. As God never WAS NOT, so He never THOUGHT not, and the Universe has no more had a beginning than the Divine Thought of which it is the utterance, no more than the Deity Himself. The
duration of the Universe is but a point halfway upon the infinite line of eternity; and God was not inert and uncreative during the eternity that stretches behind that point. The Archetype of the Universe did
never not exist in the Divine Mind. The Word was in the BEGINNING with God, and WAS God. And the Ineffable NAME is that, not of the Very Essence but of the Absolute, manifested as Being or
Existence. For Existence or Being, said the Philosophers, is limitation and the Very Deity is not limited nor defined, but is all that may possibly be, besides all that is, was, and shall be.
Reversing the letters of the Ineffable Name and dividing it, becomes bisexual, as the word YudHe or
JAH is and discloses the meaning of much of the obscure language of the Kabalah, and is The Highest of which the Columns Jachin and Boaz are the symbol. "In the image of Deity" we are told, "God
created the Man; Male and Female created He them" and the writer, symbolizing the Divine by the Human, then tells us that the woman, at first contained in the man, was taken from his side. So
Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom, was born, a woman and in armor, of the brain of Jove; Isis was the sister before she was the wife of Osiris and within BRAHM, the Source of all, the Very God, without sex or

name, was developed MAYA, the Mother of all that is. The WORD is the First and Onlybegotten of the Father and the awe with which the Highest Mysteries were regarded has imposed silence in respect
to the Nature of the Holy Spirit. The Word is Light, and the Life of Humanity.
It is for the Adepts to understand the meaning of the Symbols.
Return now, with us, to the Degrees of the Blue Masonry, and for your last lesson, receive the explanation of one of their Symbols.
You see upon the altar of those Degrees the SQUARE and the COMPASS, and you remember how they
lay upon the altar in each Degree.
The SQUARE is an instrument adapted for plane surfaces only, and therefore appropriate to Geometry, or measurement of the Earth, which appears to be and was by the Ancients supposed to be, a plane. The
COMPASS is an instrument that has relation to spheres and spherical surfaces and is adapted to spherical trigonometry, or that branch of mathematics which deals with the Heavens and the orbits of
the planetary bodies.
The SQUARE, therefore, is a natural and appropriate Symbol of this Earth and the things that belong to it, are of it, or concern it. The Compass is an equally natural and appropriate Symbol of the Heavens
and of all celestial things and celestial natures.
You see at the beginning of this reading, an old Hermetic Symbol, copied from the MATERIA PRIMA of Valentinus, printed at Frankfurt, in 1613, with a treatise entitled "AZOTEI". Upon it you see a
Triangle upon a Square, both of these contained in a circle and above this, standing upon a dragon, a human body, with two arms only, but two heads, one male and the other female. By the side of the male
head is the Sun and by that of the female head, the Moon, the crescent within the circle of the full moon. And the hand on the male side holds a Compass and that on the female side, a Square.
The Heavens and the Earth were personified as Deities, even among the Aryan Ancestors of the
European nations of the Hindus, Zends, Bactrians and Persians and the Rig Veda Sanhita contains hymns addressed to them as gods. They were deified also among the Phoenicians and among the
Greeks OURANOS and GEA, Heaven and Earth, were sung as the most ancient of the Deities, by Hesiod.
It is the great, fertile, beautiful MOTHER Earth that produces, with limitless profusion of beneficence,

633/641
everything that ministers to the needs, to the comfort and to the luxury of man. From her teeming and inexhaustible bosom come the fruits, the grain, the flowers, in their season. From it comes all that feeds
the animals which serve man as labourers and for food. She, in the fair Springtime, is green with abundant grass and the trees spring from her soil and from her teeming vitality take their wealth of
green leaves. In her womb are found the useful and valuable minerals; hers are the seas the swarm with life; hers the rivers that furnish food and irrigation and the mountains that send down the streams which
swell into these rivers; hers the forests that feed the sacred fires for the sacrifices and blaze upon the domestic hearths. The EARTH, therefore, the great PRODUCER, was always represented as a female,
as the MOTHER, Great, Bounteous, Beneficent Mother Earth.
On the other hand, it is the light and heat of the Sun in the Heavens and the rains that seem to come from them, that in the Springtime make fruitful this bountifullyproducing Earth, that restore life and
warmth to her veins, chilled by Winter, set running free her streams and beget, as it were, that greenness and that abundance of which she is so prolific. As the procreative and generative agents, the Heavens
and the Sun have always been regarded as male; as the generators that fructify the Earth and cause it to produce.
The Hermaphroditic figure is the Symbol of the double nature anciently assigned to the Deity, as
Generator and Producer, as BRAHM and MAYA among the Aryans, Osiris and Isis among the Egyptians. As the Sun was male, so the Moon was female and Isis was both the sister and the wife of
Osiris. The Compass, therefore, is the Hermetic Symbol of the Creative Deity and the Square of the productive Earth or Universe.
From the Heavens come the spiritual and immortal portion of man; from the Earth his material and
mortal portion. The Hebrew Genesis says that YEHOUAH formed man of the dust of the Earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. Through the seven planetary spheres, represented by the
Mystic Ladder of the Mithriac Initiations and it by that which Jacob saw in his dream (not with three, but with seven steps), the Souls, emanating from the Deity, descended, to be united to their human
bodies; and through those seven spheres they must reascend, to return to their origin and home in the bosom of the Deity.
The COMPASS therefore, as the Symbol of the Heavens, represents the spiritual, intellectual, and
moral portion of this double nature of humanity and the SQUARE, as the Symbol of the Earth, its material, sensual and baser portion. "Truth and Intelligence", said one of the Ancient Indian Sects of
Philosophers, "are the Eternal attributes of God, not of the individual Soul, which is susceptible both of knowledge and ignorance, of pleasure and pain; therefore God and the individual Soul are distinct" and
this expression of the ancient Nyaya Philosophers, in regard to Truth, has been handed down to us through the long succession of ages, in the lessons of Freemasonry, wherein we read, that "Truth is a
Divine Attribute and the foundation of every virtue."

634/641
"While embodied in matter" they said, "the Soul is in a state of imprisonment and is under the
influence of evil passions; but having, by intense study, arrived at the knowledge of the elements and principles of Nature, it attains unto the place of THE ETERNAL; in which state of happiness, its
individuality does not cease".
The vitality which animates the mortal frame, the Breath of Life of the Hebrew Genesis, the Hindu Philosophers in general held, perishes with it; but the Soul is divine, all emanation of the Spirit of God,
but not a portion of that Spirit. For they compared it to the heat and light sent forth from the Sun, or to a ray of that light, which neither lessens nor divides its own essence.
However created, or invested with separate existence, the Soul, which is but the creature of the Deity,
cannot know the mode of its creation, nor comprehend its own individuality. It cannot even comprehend how the being which it and the body constitute; can feel pain or see or hear. It has pleased the Universal
Creator to set bounds to the scope of our human and finite reason, beyond which it cannot reach and if we are capable of comprehending the mode and manner of the creation or generation of the Universe of
things, He has been pleased to conceal it from us by an impenetrable veil, while the words used to express the act have no other definite meaning than that He caused that Universe to commence to exist.
It is enough for us to know, what Masonry teaches, that we are not all mortal; that the Soul or Spirit, the
intellectual and reasoning portion of ourself, is our Very Self, is not subject to decay and dissolution, but is simple and immaterial, survives the death of the body, and is capable of immortality; that it is
also capable of improvement and advancement, of increase of knowledge of the things that are divine, of becoming wiser and better and more and more worthy of immortality and that to become so, and to
help to improve and benefit others and all our race, is the noblest ambition and highest glory that we can entertain and attain unto, in this momentary and imperfect life.
In every human being the Divine and the Human are intermingled. In every one there are the Reason
and the Moral sense, the passions that prompt to evil and the sensual appetites. "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die," said Paul, writing to the Christians at Rome, "but if ye through the spirit do mortify
the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God". "The flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh" he said, writing to the
Christians of Galatia, "and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would". "That which I do, I do not willingly do" he wrote to the Romans, "for what I wish to do, that I
do not do, but that which I hate I do. It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. To will, is present with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For, I do not do the good that I
desire to do and the evil that I do not wish to do, that I do do. I find then a law, that when I desire to do good, evil is present with me; for I delight in the law of God after the inward man, but I see another law
in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin

635/641
which is in my members. So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin".
Life is a battle and to fight that battle heroically and well is the great purpose of every man's existence,
who is worthy and fit to live at all. To stem the strong currents of adversity, to advance in despite of all obstacles, to snatch victory from the jealous grasp of fortune, to become a chief and a leader among
men, to rise to rank and power by eloquence, courage, perseverance, study, energy, activity, discouraged by no reverses, impatient of no delays, deterred by no hazards; to win wealth, to subjugate men by our
intellect, the very elements by our audacity, to succeed, to prosper, to thrive. Thus it is, according to the general understanding, that one fights well the battle of life. Even to succeed in business by that
boldness which halts for no risks, that audacity which stakes all upon hazardous chances; by the shrewdness of the close dealer, the boldness of the unscrupulous operator, ever by the knaveries of the
stockboard and the goldroom; to crawl up into place by disreputable means or the votes of brutal ignorance, these also are deemed to be among the great successes of life.
But that which is the greatest battle and in which the truest honour and most real success are to be won,
is that which our intellect and reason and moral sense, our spiritual natures, fight against our sensual appetites and evil passions, our earthly and material or animal nature. Therein only are the true glories
of heroism to be won, there only the successes that entitle us to triumphs.
In every human life that battle is fought and those who win elsewhere, often suffer ignominious defeat and disastrous rout and discomfiture and shameful downfall in this encounter.
You have heard more than one definition of Freemasonry. The truest and the most significant you have
yet to hear. It is taught to the entered Apprentice, the FellowCraft and the Master, and it is taught in every Degree through which you have advanced to this. It is a definition of what Freemasonry is, of
what its purposes and its very essence and spirit are and it has for every one of us the force and sanctity of a divine law and imposes on every one of us a solemn obligation.
It is symbolized and taught, to the Apprentice as well as to you, by the COMPASS and the SQUARE;
upon which, as well as upon the Book of your Religion and the Book of the law of the Scottish Freemasonry, you have taken so many obligations. As a Knight, you have been taught it by the Swords,
the symbols of HONOUR and DUTY, on which you have taken your vows: it was taught you by the BALANCE, the symbol of all Equilibrium and by the CROSS, the symbol of devotedness and self
sacrifice; but all that these teach and contain is taught and contained, for Entered Apprentice, Knight and Prince alike, by the Compass and the Square.
For the Apprentice, the points of the Compass are beneath the Square. For the FellowCraft, one is

636/641
above and one beneath. For the Master, both are dominant and have rule, control and empire over the symbol of the earthly and the material.
FREEMASONRY is the subjugation of the Human that is in man by the Divine; the Conquest of the
Appetites and Passions by the Moral Sense and the Reason; a continual effort, struggle and warfare of the Spiritual against the Material and Sensual. That victory, when it has been achieved and secured, and
the conqueror may rest upon his shield and wear the wellearned laurels, is the true HOLY EMPIRE.
To achieve it, the Mason must first attain a solid conviction, founded upon reason, that he hath within him a spiritual nature, a soul that is not to die when the body is dissolved, but is to continue to exist and
to advance toward perfection through all the ages of eternity, and to see more and more clearly, as it draws nearer unto God, the Light of the Divine Presence. This the Philosophy of the Ancient and
Accepted Rite teaches him and it encourages him to persevere by helping him to believe that his free will is entirely consistent with God's Omnipotence and Omniscience; that He is not only infinite in
power and of infinite wisdom, but of infinite mercy, and an infinitely tender pity and love for the frail and imperfect creatures that He has made. Every Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite,
from the first to the thirtysecond, teaches by its ceremonial as well as by its instruction, that the noblest purpose of life and the highest duty of a man are to strive incessantly and vigorously to win the mastery
of everything, of that which in him is spiritual and divine, over that which is material and sensual; so that in him also, as in the Universe which God governs, Harmony and Beauty may be the result of a just
equilibrium.
You have been taught this in those Degrees, conferred in the Lodge of Perfection, which inculcate particularly the practical morality of Freemasonry. To be true, under whatever temptation to be false; to
be honest in all your dealings, even if great losses should be the consequence; to be charitable, when selfishness would prompt you to close your hand, and deprivation of luxury or comfort must follow the
charitable act; to judge justly and impartially, even in your own case, when baser impulses prompt you to do an injustice in order that you may be benefited or justified; to be tolerant, when passion prompts
to intolerance and persecution; to do that which is right, when the wrong seems to promise larger profit and to wrong no man of anything that is his, however easy it may seem so to enrich yourself; in all
these things and others which you promised in those Degrees, your spiritual nature is taught and encouraged to assert its rightful dominion over your appetites and passions.
The philosophical Degrees have taught you the value of knowledge, the excellence of truth, the
superiority of intellectual labour, the dignity and value of your soul, the worth of great and noble thoughts and thus endeavoured to assist you to rise above the level of the animal appetites and passions,
the pursuits of greed and the miserable struggles of ambition and to find purer pleasure and nobler prizes and rewards in the acquisition of knowledge, the enlargement of the intellect, the interpretation
of the sacred writing of God upon the great pages of the Book of Nature.

637/641
And the Chivalric Degrees have led you on the same path, by showing you the excellence of generosity,
clemency, forgiveness of injuries, magnanimity, contempt of danger and the paramount obligations of Duty and Honour. They have taught you to overcome the fear of death, to devote yourself to the great
cause of civil and religious Liberty, to be the Soldier of all that is just right and true; in the midst of pestilence to deserve your title of Knight Commander of the Temple and neither there nor elsewhere to
desert your post and flee dastardlike from the foe. In all this, you assert the superiority and right to dominion of that in you which is spiritual and divine. No base fear of danger or death, no sordid
ambitions or pitiful greeds or base considerations can tempt a true Scottish Knight to dishonour and so make his intellect, his reason, his soul, the bondslave of his appetites, of his passions, of that which is
material and animal, selfish and brutish in his nature.
It is not possible to create a true and genuine Brotherhood upon any theory of the baseness of human nature; nor by a community of belief in abstract propositions as to the nature of the Deity, the number
of His persons, or other theorems of religious faith; nor by the establishment of a system of association simply for mutual relief and by which, in consideration of certain payments regularly made, each
becomes entitled to a certain stipend in case of sickness, to attention then, and to the ceremonies of burial after death.
There can be no genuine Brotherhood without mutual regard good opinion and esteem, mutual charity,
and mutual allowance for faults and failings. It is those only who learn habitually to think better of each other, to look habitually for the good that is in each other, and expect, allow for, and overlook, the evil,
who can be Brethren one of the other, in any truse sense of the word. Those who gloat over the failings of one another, who think each other to be naturally base and low, of a nature in which the Evil
predominates and excellence is not to be looked for, cannot be even friends, and much less Brethren.
No one can have a right to think meanly of his race, unless he also thinks meanly of himself. If, from a single fault or error, he judges of the character of another, and takes the single act as evidence of the
whole nature of the man and of the whole course of his life, he ought to consent to be judged by the same rule and to admit it to be right that others should thus uncharitably condemn himself. But such
judgments will become impossible when he incessantly reminds himself that in every man who lives there is an immortal Soul endeavouring to do that which is right and just; a Ray, however small, and
almost inappreciable, from the Great Source of Light and Intelligence, which ever struggles upward amid all the impediments of sense and the obstructions of the passions and that in every man this ray
continually wages war against his evil passions and his unruly appetites or if it has succumbed, is never wholly extinguished and annihilated. For he will then see that it is not victory, but the struggle that
deserves honour; since in this as in all else no man can always command success. Amid a cloud of errors, of failure and shortcomings, he will look for the struggling Soul, for that which is good in every
one amid the evil and believing that each is better than from his acts and omissions he seems to be, and that God cares for him still, and pities him and loves him, he will feel that even the erring sinner is still

his brother, still entitled to his sympathy and bound to him by the indissoluble ties of fellowship.
If there be nothing of the divine in man, what is he, after all, but a more intelligent animal? He hath no fault nor vice which some beast hath not and therefore in his vices he is but a beast of a higher order
and he hath hardly any moral excellence, perhaps none, which some animal hath not in as great a degree, even the more excellent of these, such as generosity, fidelity and magnanimity.
Bardesan, the Syrian Christian, in his Book of the Laws of Countries, says, of men, that "in the things
belonging to their bodies, they maintain their nature like animals, and in the things which belong to their minds, they do that which they wish, as being free and with power and as the likeness of God" and
Meliton, Bishop of Sardis, in his Oration to Antoninus Caesar, says, "Let Him, the everliving God, be always present in thy, mind; for thy mind itself is His likeness, for it, too, is invisible and impalpable,
and without form. As He exists forever, so thou also, when thou shalt have put off this which is visible and corruptible, shalt stand before Him forever, living and endowed with knowledge."
As a matter far above our comprehension and in the Hebrew Genesis the words that are used to express
the origin of things are of uncertain meaning and with equal propriety may be translated by the word "generated", "produced," "made" or "created" we need not dispute nor debate whether the Soul or Spirit
of man be a ray that has emanated or flowed forth from the Supreme Intelligence, or whether the Infinite Power hath called each into existence from nothing, by a mere exertion of Its will, and endowed
it with immortality and with intelligence like unto the Divine Intelligence for in either case it may be said that in man the Divine is united to the Human. Of this union the equilateral Triangle inscribed
within the Square is a Symbol.
We see the Soul, Plato said, as men see the statue of Glaucus, recovered from the sea wherein it had lain many years which viewing, it was not easy, if possible, to discern what was its original nature, its
limbs having been partly broken and partly worn and by defacement changed, by the action of the waves and shells, weeds and pebbles adhering to it, so that it more resembled some strange monster
than that which it was when it left its Divine Source. Even so, he said, we see the Soul, deformed by innumerable things that have done it harm, have mutilated and defaced it. But the Mason who hath the
ROYAL SECRET can also with him argue, from beholding its love of wisdom, its tendency toward association with what is divine and immortal, its larger aspirations, its struggles, though they may have
ended in defeat, with the impediments and enthralments of the senses and the passions, that when it shall have been rescued from the material environments that now prove too strong for it and be freed
from the deforming and disfiguring accretions that here adhere to it, it will again be seen in its true nature, and by degrees ascend by the mystic ladder of the Spheres, to its first home and place of origin.

advisable and Philosophy is for you, radiant with a divine beauty, is that which the Sohar terms The Mystery of the BALANCE. It is the Secret of the UNIVERSAL EQUILIBRIUM.
Of that Equilibrium in the Deity, between the Infinite Divine WISDOM and the Infinite Divine
POWER, from which result the Stability of the Universe, the unchangeableness of the Divine Law, and the Principles of Truth, Justice, and Right which are a part of it and the Supreme Obligation of the
Divine Law upon all men, as superior to all other law and forming a part of all the laws of men and nations.
Of that Equilibrium also, between the Infinite Divine JUSTICE and the Infinite Divine MERCY, the
result of which is the Infinite Divine EQUITY and the Moral Harmony or Beauty of the Universe. By it the endurance of created and imperfect natures in the presence of a Perfect Deity is made possible and
for Him, also as for us, to love is better than to hate and Forgiveness is wiser than Revenge or Punishment.
Of that Equilibrium between NECESSITY and LIBERTY, between the action of the DIVINE
Omnipotence and the Free will of man, by which vices and base actions and ungenerous thoughts and words are crimes and wrongs, justly punished by the law of cause and consequence, though nothing in
the Universe can happen or be done contrary to the will of God and without which coexistence of Liberty and Necessity, of Free will in the creature and Omnipotence in the Creator, there could be no
religion, nor any law of right and wrong, or merit and demerit, nor any justice in human punishments or penal laws.
Of that Equilibrium between Good and Evil and Light and Darkness in the world, which assures us that
all is the work of the Infinite Wisdom and of an Infinite Love and that there is no rebellious demon of Evil, or Principle of Darkness coexistent and in eternal controversy with God or the Principle of Light
and of Good by attaining to the knowledge of which equilibrium we can, through Faith, see that the existence of Evil, Sin, Suffering and Sorrow in the world, is consistent with the Infinite Goodness as
well as with the Infinite Wisdom of the Almighty.
Sympathy and Antipathy, Attraction and Repulsion, each a Force of nature, are contraries, in the souls of men and in the Universe of spheres and worlds and from the action and opposition of each against
the other, result Harmony and that movement which is the Life of the Universe and the Soul alike. They are not antagonists of each other. The force that repels a planet from the Sun is no more an evil force,
than that which attracts the Planet toward the central Luminary; for each is created and exerted by the Deity and the result is the harmonious movement of the obedient Planets in their elliptic orbits, and the
mathematical accuracy and unvarying regularity of their movements.

Of that Equilibrium between Authority and Individual Action which constitutes Free Government, by settling on immutable foundations Liberty with Obedience to Law, Equality with Subjection to
Authority, and Fraternity with Subordination to the Wisest and the Best and of that Equilibrium between the Active Energy of the Will of the Present, expressed by the Vote of the People, and the
Passive Stability and Permanence of the Will of the Past, expressed in constitutions of government, written or unwritten, and in the laws and customs, gray with age and sanctified by time, as precedents
and authority; which is represented by the arch resting on the two columns, Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the portals of the Temple builded by Wisdom, on one of which Masonry sets the celestial Globe,
symbol of the spiritual part of our composite nature and on the other the terrestrial Globe, symbol of the material part.
And, finally, of that Equilibrium, possible in ourselves and which Masonry incessantly labours to
accomplish in its Initiates, and demands of its Adepts and Princes (else unworthy of their titles), between the Spiritual and Divine and the Material and Human in man; between the Intellect, Reason,
and Moral Sense on one side, and the Appetites and Passions on the other, from which result the Harmony and Beauty of a wellregulated life.
Which possible Equilibrium proves to us that our Appetites and Senses also are Forces given unto us by
God, for purposes of good, and not the fruits of the malignancy of a Devil, to be detested, mortified and if possible, rendered inert and dead that they are given us to be the means by which we shall be
strengthened and incited to great and good deeds and are to be wisely used, and not abused; to be controlled and kept within due bounds by the Reason and the Moral Sense; to be made useful
instruments and servants and not permitted to become the managers and masters, using our intellect and reason as base instrument for their gratification.
And this Equilibrium teaches us, above all, to reverence ourselves as immortal souls and to have respect
and charity for others, who are even such as we are, partakers with us of the Divine Nature, lighted by a ray of the Divine Intelligence, struggling like us toward the light; capable, like us, of progress upward
toward perfection and deserving to be loved and pitied, but never to be hated nor despised; to be aided and encouraged in this lifestruggle and not to be abandoned nor left to wander in the darkness alone,
still less to be trampled upon in our own efforts to ascend.
From the mutual action and reaction of each of these pairs of opposites and contraries results that which with them forms the Triangle, to all the Ancient Sages the expressive symbol of the Deity; as
from Osiris and Isis, Haroeri, the Master of Light and Life and the Creative Word. At the angles of one stand, symbolically, the three columns that support the Lodge, itself a symbol of the Universe, Wisdom,
Power and Harmony or Beauty. One of these symbols, found on the TracingBoard of the Apprentice's Degree, teaches this last lesson of Freemasonry. It is the rightangled Triangle, representing man, as a
union of the spiritual and material, of the divine arid human. The base, measured by the number 3, the

number of the Triangle, represents the Deity and the Divine; the perpendicular, measured by the number 4, the number of the Square, represents the Earth, the Material, and the Human and the
hypothenuse, measured by 5, represents that nature which is produced by the union of the Divine and Human, the Soul and the Body; the squares, 9 and 16, of the base and perpendicular, added together,
producing 25, the square root whereof is 5, the measure of the hypothenuse.
And as in each Triangle of Perfection, one is three and three are one, so man is one, though of a double nature and he attains the purposes of his being only when the two natures that are in him are in just
equilibrium and his life is a success only when it too is a harmony, and beautiful, like the great Harmonies of God and the Universe.
Such, my Brother, is the TRUE WORD of a Master Mason; such the true ROYAL SECRET, which
makes possible and shall at length make real, the HOLY EMPIRE of true Masonic Brotherhood.
