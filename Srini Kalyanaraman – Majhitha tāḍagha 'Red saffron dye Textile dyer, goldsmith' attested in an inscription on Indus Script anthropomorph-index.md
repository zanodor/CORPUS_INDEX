Majhitha tāḍagha 'Red saffron dye Textile dyer, goldsmith' attested in an inscription on Indus Script anthropomorph
--validates JM Kenoyer's thesis of textile dyeing at Harappa on circular worker platforms;
--mañjiṣṭhā 'Indian madder, saffron/red dye for garments' is 1) archaeologically attested from Mohenjo-daro and 2) on an Indus Script inscription on an Anthromorph;
--reaffirms the possibility of vats used on circular worker platforms of Harappa to dye textiles with red/saffron madder dye and also possibly, indigo dye; the 'granary' or 'warehouse' may have been used to dry and store the dyed textiles.
The 'warehouse' compares with a hieroglyh used on a Dholavira two-sided tablet.
See Annex for decipherment of Indus Script hieroglyphs on this tablet. dhokra ‘decrepit woman with breasts hanging down’. Rebus: dhokra kamar 'artisan metalcaster using lost-wax technique'. The first hieroglyph on the text message on
Side A is a 'warehouse' descriptor.
kāruvu ‘crocodile’ Rebus: khār ‘blacksmith’ (Kashmiri) is shown on Side B.
The decrepit woman is ligatured to the thigh of a bovine. ख ोंड khōṇḍa 'young bull' rebus: kundar 'turner, lathe-worker'.
I suggest that this Sign 244 is descriptive orthograph of a warehouse or granary of the type seen in Harappa archaeological site. This is signified by the Meluhha rebus rendering of the the hieroglyph by the wordkoṭṭha:

This is an addendum to:
1. Brāhmī inscription on Indus Script anthropomorph reads: symbol of माोंझीथा Majhīthā sadya 'member of mã̄ jhī boat people assembly (community)' https://tinyurl.com/y85lflto
2. Indus Script solves the mysteries of stupa, circular platforms, archaeology identifies in Mohenjo-daro karaṇaśāle 'office of writers' https://tinyurl.com/s6qq46m 3. Dholavira tablet text message: koṭṭhāra 'warehouse' (of) kuṭila sal 'bronze workshop' PLUS dul khaṇḍa 'cast metal implements' https://tinyurl.com/ydhrb74c
The professional calling card used by metal merchants of Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization is overlayed with Brāhmī inscription (at a later date) by a goldsmith guild (mã̄ jhī) working with madder, red saffron dye source for textiles. The reference to माोंझीथा Majhīthā is significant and indicates the continuing tradition of dyeing textiles, from the days of Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization.
samjñā 'symbol, sign'
kī ma jhi tha 'of Majhitha'
Sha (ta?) Da Ya (Gha?) Line 3 is read as taDagha. The word attested by Pāṇini is tāḍagha m. a kind of artificer (blacksmith?), Pāṇ. 3-2, 55. Thus, the later-day holder of the professional calling card (a possible descendant from the days of Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization) proclaims himself as Majhitha tāḍagha 'Textile dyer, goldsmith'
I submit that this decipherment of the anthropomorph mentioning माोंझीथा Majhīthā ‘madder or red/saffron dye for textiles’ validates – in a later-day Brāhmī inscription, 1) the discovery by HARP team of possible indigo vats in the central pits of circular working platforms and 2) the hypothesis that the ‘granary’ of Harappa was indeed a “building for dyeing and drying fabrics” (JM Kenoyer).

Madder. Rubia tinctorum, the rose madder or common madder or dyer's madder, is a herbaceous perennial plant species belonging to the bedstraw and coffee family Rubiaceae...
The roots can be over a metre long, up to 12 mm thick and the source of red dyes known as rose madder and Turkey red... It has been used since ancient times as a vegetable red dye for leather, wool, cotton and silk. For dye production, the roots are harvested after two years. The outer red layer gives the common variety of the dye, the inner yellow layer the refined variety. The dye is fixed to the cloth with help of a mordant, most commonly alum. Madder can be fermented for dyeing as well (Fleurs de garance)... The pulverised roots can be dissolved in sulfuric acid, which leaves a dye called garance (the French name for madder) after drying... Early evidence of dyeing comes from India where a piece of cotton dyed with madder has been recovered from the archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro (3rd millennium BCE). H. C. Bhardwaj & K. K. Jain (1982). "Indian dyes and dyeing industry during 18th–19th century" (PDF). Indian Journal of History of Science. New Delhi: Indian National Science Academy. 17 (11): 70–81. ()

“In India the earliest evidence of dyeing comes from Indus civilization (2300-1750 BCE) from where a piece of cotton at Mohenjo-daro, dyed with madder – a vegetable dye has been found. (Marshall, John, ed., Mohenjodaro and the Indus Civilization, Indological Book House, Delhi, 1973, p.32-33; reprint of 1931 edition. ” https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.722

Marshall reports that Messrs. Gulati and Turner opined that the purple dye on a scrap of cotton material found in Mohenjo-daro could be of the madder class.
This is further evaluated in an article by HC Bhardwaj and Kamal K. Jain in Indian Journal of History of Science, 17(1): 70-81. Bhardwaj and Kamal Jain note: "In fact, some of the dyes namely Indigo, Madder and Kermes were introduced all over the world by the Indians during very early periods. A red dye obtained either from Madder or Kermes was tactfully used by Alexander the Great, as probably the first important use of camouflage in war to win the battle against Persians. Similarly, Indigo was the dye selected for colouring the uniforms of British navy." (p. 70 ibid.)
This is the context in which the hypothesis of James Kenoyer becomes validated. Kenoyer found

Mystery platforms
https://www.harappa.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Kenoyer2004%20IndusTextilesfinal.pdf
Circular platforms in the southwestern part of Mound F excavated by M.S. Vats in the 1920s and 1930s, as conserved by the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan.
"What about the platforms? Another perplexing Indus mystery concerns the so-called workingmen's platforms at Harappa, next to the "granary" whose purpose also eludes us. Photographs from the excavations by the Harappa Archaeological Research Project following M.S. Vats work in the 1920's and 1930's led to at least one interesting clue. Additionally, the direction of the bricks suggests water was used here. "

At Harappa a series of circular brick platform was possibly utilized in the preparation of indigo dye or dyeing (Kenoyer, J. M. 1998. Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilizatiion. Oxford American Institute of Pakistan Studies.)
“What was going on atop these baked-brick, circular platforms inside enclosed structures? At Harappan sites, platforms of closely fitted bricks laid on edge are usually associated with the use of water. Perhaps these circular platform installations were used to prepare indigo dye, which in South Asia traditionally involved fermentation in a darkened room. Sediment taken from between the bricks and in the center cavity of the HARP platform is being analyzed to test this hypothesis.” (Richard H. Meadow and Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, 2000, The Indus Valley Mystery, One of the world’s first great civilizations is still a puzzle, in: Scientific American, March/April 2000, pp.42-43; discoveringarchaeology.com)

"What was the so-called granary used for? There are twelve rooms in this 50 by 40 meter building. It was built on a giant mud-brick platform between 2200 and 2300 BCE, but there is an earlier building under at least one section. Between the rooms are sleeper walls. Excavations in 1998-2000 of this area led to no discovery of grain or pots. At Harappa this structure is next to the equally mysterious "workingmen's platforms" where we think some sort of labor involving water took place (but no traces of indigo dye are found). At Mohenjodaro, this structure is next to the Great Bath. What purpose do you think it could have served?"

VS Area, Section A. Block I, House II: Room 23, showing brick floor with dyeing troughs 15
[Original 1931 caption] "House II. - Rooms 1 to 26, covering a rectangular area of 86 ft. 10 in. by 64 ft. 5 in. to the north of the building just described, appear originally to have belonged to one and the same house, which had two entrances opening into the main street on the east and another into Lane I on the north. At a subsequent date the building appears to have been divided into four separate dwellings. . .. Noteworthy features of this room are five conical pits or holes dug into the floor and lined with wedge-shaped bricks, apparently meant to hold the pointed bases of large storage jars, and what seems to have been a very narrow well in the S.E. corner. Room 2 has a small chamber screened off in its N.W. corner and a paved bath or floor for cleaning utensils in the other corner, with a covered drain to carry of waste water into the cesspit in front of Room I." [Marshall, Vol. I. p. 216]

[quote] "This room in VS area was made with bricks set on edge to create a watertight floor. A small well was located in the southeast corner (top right) and circular brick depressions were set into the floor, presumably to hold pottery vessels. The early excavators suggested that the room might have been a dyer's workshop" (Mark Kenoyer).
Sir Mortimer Wheeler, the early excavator, wrote: "Of another kind is a building fronting upon one of the main streets, 'First Street', in VR Area (Mohenjo-daro). Its outside dimensions are 87 by 64.5 feet, but within that considerable framework are included not only residential quarters around the courtyard but also, towards the street, industrial or commercial

premises of some note: in particular, three rooms neatly paved with bricks on edge, one room with five conical pits or holes sunk in the floor and lined with wedge-shaped bricks, apparently to hold the pointed bases of large jars. In a corner of the room is a well, and nearby is the usual brick staircase. The premises may have been a public restaurant, but it is alternatively possible that the implied jars were, rather, dyeing vats." (The Indus Civilization, p. 51)[unquote]
https://www.harappa.com/blog/dyers-workshop
In an article (2004) ‘Ancient Textiles of the Indus Valley Region, in Tana Bana: The woven soul of Pakistan, edited by Noorjehan Bilgrami, pp.18-31, Koel Publications, Karachi, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer notes: “The most common fibres used in the Indua Valley appear to have been cotton, but various types of wool and possibly jute or hemp fibres were also used. Most recently, the discovery of silk thread inside copper beads from the site of Harappa indicates that wild silk was also known to the ancient inhabitants of the region, though there is no evidence to suggest that it was woven into fabric...One of the most famous examples of a textile from the site of Mohenjo-Daro is seen on a small stone sculpture with a cloak thrown over the left shoulder. Often referred to as the ‘Priest-King’ this sculpture shows the use of circular designs comprised of circles, double circles and trefoils. When the sculpture was first discovered, the trefoils and circles were filled with red pigment and the background was filled with a dark pigment that may have originally been green or blue. The white color of the original stone would hve been visible in the form of the circle, resulting in a striking pattern made of green or blue with red and white designs. This type of patterning, using indigo, madder and bleached cotton, is still commonly used in the priting of ajrak block prints in modern Sindh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Due to the lack of repetition in the design, the cloak worn by the ‘priest-king’ probably is not a block printed textile, but may have been made with large embroidered designs or by tie dyeing... ”

[quote] There is no hard and fast proof yet that indigo was an important dye during Indus times, but it is quite possible. Hobson-Jobson (1903) defines indigo as: "The plant Indigofera tinctoria, L. (N.O. Leguminosao), and the dark blue dye made from it. Greek [xxxx]. This word appears from Hippocrates to have been applied in his time to Pepper. It is also applied by Dioscorides to the mineral substance (a variety of the red oxide of iron) called Indian red (F. Adams, Appendix to Dunbar's LexiconLiddell & Scott call it "a dark blue dye, indigo." The dye was used in Egyptian mummy cloths (Wilkinson, Ancient Egypt, ed. 1878, ii. 163).]
The earliest reference Hobson-Jobson gives is "a.D. c. 60.–"Of that which is called [xxxx] one kind is produced spontaneously, being as it were a scum thrown out by the Indian reeds; but that used for dyeing is purple efflorescence which flots on the brazen cauldrons, which the craftsmen skim off and dry. That is deemed best which is blue in colour, succulent, and smooth to the touch. Dioscorides, v. cap. 107. (Henry Yule and A.C. Burnell, HobsonJobson, John Murray, 1903 [1994], p. 437).
Wikipedia defines indigo asa "Species of Indigofera were cultivated in India, East Asia and Egypt in antiquity. Pliny mentions India as the source of the dye, imported in small quantities via the Silk Road. The Greek term for the dye was Ἰνδικὸν φάρμακον ("Indian dye"), which, adopted to Latin as indicum and via Portuguese gave rise to the modern word indigo."
Gregory Possehl writes in one of the few references by an Indus scholar, "Indigo and Lathyrus odoratus, both legumes, the root nodules of which help in the natural fertilization of the soil, were once widely cultivated in the western region of the subcontinent. Their cultiuvation was stopped by the British and this adversely affected soil fertility (Harappan Civilization, p. 35).[unquote]https://www.harappa.com/blog/night-indigo

Annex Decipherment of two-sided Dholavira tablet
This text message on Dholavira tablet includes a hieroglyph which compares with Sign 244 (Mahadevan Concordance, ASI 1987):
I suggest that this Sign 244 is descriptive orthograph of a warehouse or granary of the type seen in Harappa archaeological site.
"The so-called "granary" of Harappa is found on Mound F. It is a brick structure that was built on a massive brick foundation over 45 meters north south and 45 meters eastwest. Two rows of six rooms that appear to be foundations are arranged along a central passageway that is about 7 meters wide and partly paved with baked bricks. Each room measures 15.2 by 6.1 meters and has three sleeper walls with air space between them. A wooden superstructure supported in some places by large columns would have been built on top of the brick foundations, with stairs leading up from the central passage area. Small triangular opening may have served as air ducts to allow the flow of fresh air beneath the hollow floors.
No special concentrations of burned grain or storage containers were discovered by the earlier excavators and the interpretation of these structures as granaries is based on comparisons with Roman buildings and has no parallels with any building tradition in South Asia. Most scholars agree that there is little evidence for the construction of massive granaries at either Mohenjo-daro or Harappa and that these structures should only be seen as evidence for large public buildings. Rulers and state officials probably did meet in such large public buildings and many of them may have been used for specific religious functions, but their specific function will always remain a mystery." https://www.harappa.com/slide/granary-harappa
