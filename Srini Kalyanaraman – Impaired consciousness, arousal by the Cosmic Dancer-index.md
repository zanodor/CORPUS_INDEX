Abstract
When drug-resistant epilepsy is poorly localized or surgical resection is contraindicated, current neurostimulation strategies
such as deep brain stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation can palliate the frequency or severity of seizures. However,
despite medical and neuromodulatory therapy, a signifcant proportion of patients continue to experience disabling seizures
that impair awareness, causing disability and risking injury or sudden unexplained death. We propose a novel strategy in
which neuromodulation is used not only to reduce seizures but also to ameliorate impaired consciousness when the patient
is in the ictal and postictal states. Improving or preventing alterations in level of consciousness may have an effect on
morbidity (e.g., accidents, drownings, falls), risk for death, and quality of life. Recent studies may have elucidated
underlying networks and mechanisms of impaired consciousness and yield potential novel targets for neuromodulation.
The feasibility, benefts, and pitfalls of potential deep brain stimulation targets are illustrated in human and animal studies
involving minimally conscious/vegetative states, movement disorders, depth of anesthesia, sleep-wake regulation, and
epilepsy. We review evidence that viable therapeutic targets for impaired consciousness associated with seizures may be
provided by key nodes of the consciousness system in the brainstem reticular activating system, hypothalamus, basal
ganglia, thalamus, and basal forebrain. http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2015.3.FOCUS1535

Epilepsy and Circadian rhythm

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7225332/
Bidirectional interactions between sleep and epilepsy have been recognized
for centuries. Patients with epilepsy often have associated co-morbid major
sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (1). On the other hand, sleep
disruption is one of the major risk factors for the likelihood of recurrent
seizures (2). In addition, the circadian rhythm itself seems to influence the
timing and the severity of epileptic seizures (3). Unraveling the underlying
mechanism of these interactions may lead to new treatment strategies for
epilepsy. Here we comprehensively review the recent advances in the
relationship between circadian rhythms, sleep, and epilepsy.

Circadian rhythms, sleep, and epilepsy



Excerpts: A Brief Introduction to Circadian Rhythm
The circadian rhythm refers to the 24-h cycle of behavioral and physiological activity. The circadian
rhythmicity of mammals is a hierarchically organized multi-oscillator system, coordinated by a central
pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (4, 5). The molecular mechanism
underlying circadian rhythm are cell-autonomous transcription–translation feedback loops comprising a set of
core-clock genes: brain muscle aryl nuclear translocase like-1 (BMAL1), circadian locomotor output cycles
kaput (CLOCK), Period (PER1, PER2, and PER3), and cryptochrome (CRY1 and CRY2) (6). The BMAL1
and CLOCK heterodimerize during the early circadian day and activate the transcription of PER and CRY
with promoters containing circadian E-box elements. During the early circadian night, complexes containing
PER and CRY repress BMAL1–CLOCK-mediated transcription. During the later circadian night, the PER
CRY complexes degrade, and the cycle starts again (5, 7). In addition, BMAL1–CLOCK complexes activate
the expression of nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and ROR, which ultimately compete to repress or activate
BMAL1 transcription, respectively (8, 9). Complementary to these feedback loops, the circadian rhythm is
modulated by various regulations at the post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels to fine
tune the circadian system (10–12). The details of their exact role and function are beyond the scope of this
review, but they can be found in previously published articles (13).

Circadian rhythms, epilepsy-1



Excerpts: Core-Clock Gene and Epilepsy
The core-clock genes not only regulate the circadian rhythms (14, 15) but also contribute to epileptic
susceptibility. The core-clock genes can disrupt the neuronal inhibitory and the excitatory balance
rhythmically, leading to seizure periodicity (16–18). In a post-status epilepticus animal model of mesial
temporal lobe epilepsy, the expression of core-clock genes is found to be dysregulated during epileptogenesis:
the expression of PER1 and CRY1 increases in the early post-status epilepticus condition compared to the
control condition and decreases to the baseline level in epileptic condition; the expression of BMAL1,
CLOCK, and CRY2 gradually decreases during epileptogenesis (17). However, the exact role of the core
clock genes in the process of epileptogenesis remains unknown. Future studies with functional assays may
give us more insight. Besides that, in the animal model of generalized seizure induced by electrical
stimulation, the circadian profile of seizure threshold is absent in BMAL1 knock-out mice and its seizure
threshold is significantly lower compared to that of the wild-type mice (19). Interestingly, the expression of
the CLOCK gene in epileptic brain specimens, obtained from focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), and tuberous
sclerosis complex (TSC) cases, is found to be reduced in epileptogenic tissue when compared to control
tissue. In addition, Emx- Cre, Clockflox/flox mice with conditional deletion of CLOCK in the excitatory
neurons, exhibits sleep-related seizures (20). Those results suggest that the disruption of the function of the
core-clock genes may play an important role in the generation of focal epilepsy. However, most experiments
are conducted on temporal lobe epilepsy; further studies on extratemporal lobe epilepsy are warranted.

Circadian rhythms, epilepsy-2



Excerpts
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of
protein and lipid synthesis, growth, and proliferation of cells (21). A series of recent
publications have shown that the mTOR pathway is overactivated in the epileptic tissue
obtained from temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and FCD (22, 23).
Interestingly, several results have shown that there is a close interaction between core-clock
genes and the mTOR signaling pathway. Circadian rhythmicity can be observed in the mTOR
signaling pathway (24, 25). Furthermore, BMAL1, which is activated by the mTOR complex
1 kinase pathway via phosphorylation, regulates protein synthesis (26). The circadian rhythm
abnormalities of TSC mouse and cellular models are controlled by increased translation and
decreased degradation of BMAL1 (27). Additionally, BMAL1 negatively regulates mTOR
complex 1, and this regulation is essential for aging (25). Taking these findings together, we
speculate that core-clock genes might play an essential role in the type of epilepsy associated
with mTORopathies. Thus, core-clock genes may be considered as the potential innovative
targets for epilepsy treatment.

Circadian rhythms, epilepsy-3



Excerpts.Seizure Forecasting
Seizure prediction can prevent or reduce the risk of a seizure and its complication, and it has been explored
for decades. Karoly et al. analyzed nine patients' chronic intracranial EEG data and illustrated that the
incorporation of the individual circadian patterns of seizures into EEG signals could greatly improve the
accuracy of the seizure prediction algorithms (69). Baud et al. reported that seizures occurred preferentially
during the rising phase of multi-day IED rhythms (3). Thus, adding patient-specific multi-day IED rhythms
may further enhance the accuracy of seizure prediction algorithms. However, only a small portion of patients
with epilepsy have these intracranial devices, and it may be impossible to generalize these aspects of
seizures to all patients with epilepsy. Further investigations are crucial to find a better way to predict seizure
occurrence using non-invasive devices, including the factors which have a close relationship to the timing of
seizure occurrence such as seizure-onset zone and seizure types.

Excerpts.Conclusions
Long-term EEG video monitoring and the clinical application of closed-loop
implantable brain stimulators have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the interaction
between circadian rhythms, sleep, and epilepsy. Clock genes such as CLOCK may play
an essential role in the generation of focal epilepsy, such as FCD type II, which is
paradigmatic mTOR-opathy. These disorders can be considered as human models
which may help us to better understand the reciprocal relationship between the clock
genes and the mTOR signaling pathway. Although chronotherapy can reduce seizure
frequency and the side effects of AEDs, further clinical trials with bigger sample sizes
are necessary. Before this treatment strategy can be utilized in the clinical setting,
multi-center studies, or randomized controlled trials are warranted. Adding individual
circadian rhythms in seizure prediction algorithms is promising. If these algorithms
were readily available from the non-invasive EEG data, a significant number of
patients would benefit from it.
