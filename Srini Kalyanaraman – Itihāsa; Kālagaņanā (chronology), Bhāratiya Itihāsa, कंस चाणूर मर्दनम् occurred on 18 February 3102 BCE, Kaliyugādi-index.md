Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī discusses this verse as follows: “One may object that at this point Lord Kṛṣṇa had not actually passed the kaiśora stage [age ten to fifteen], since the women of Mathurā had stated, kva cāti
sukumārāṅgau kiśorau nāpta-yauvanau: ‘Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma have very tender limbs, being still at the kiśora stage, not having reached adolescence.’ (Bhāg. 10.44.8) The definition of the different stages of growing up is given as follows:
kaumāraṁ pañcamābdāntaṁ paugaṇḍaṁ daśamāvadhi kaiśoram ā-pañcadaśād
yauvanaṁ tu tataḥ param

‘The kaumāra stage lasts until the age of five, paugaṇḍa up to age ten and kaiśora to age fifteen. From then on, one is known as yauvana.’ According to this statement, the kaiśora period ends at the age of fifteen. Kṛṣṇa was only eleven years old when He killed Kaṁsa, according to
Uddhava’s words: ekādaśa-samās tatra gūḍhārciḥ sa-balo ’vasat. ‘Like a covered flame, Lord Kṛṣṇa remained there incognito with Balarāma for eleven years.’ (Bhāg. 3.2.26) And since Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma never took brahminical initiation in Vraja-bhūmi, it was at the time [of Their going to Mathurā] that Their kaiśora stage began rather than ended.

The presentation is premised on the fact that ALL events of MBh war occurred AFTER the dawn of Kaliyuga. Some astronomers counter this view considering 18 Feb 3102 to signify the end of Krishna avatāra; hopefully there will be a consensus so that Veda stellarium can be presented on all Planetaria based on Kālagaņanā of BhāratiyaItihāsa.

presented in Jayasree Saranathan: Mathematical proof for why the Julian date of the astronomy software can never corroborate the Vedic date of Mahabharata (Supplement to Mahabharata date series -3).

Birth date of Sri कृ ष्ण kṛṣṇa: 27 July 3112 BCE Friday. He was 11 years' old on 18 Feb. 3102, the start date of Kaliyuga Era. This is recognised as the start date because of the divine event narrated of कं स चाणूर मदर्नम्‌ ।
What is the textual pramāna that Sri कृ ष्ण kṛṣṇa was 11 years old when divine event occurred?

The clue is provided by Bhāgavata Purāna 3.2.26 which indicates that the two brothers resided11 years in the Gurukula of Sāndīpani (सान्दीिनन ) before returning to Mathura:

ŚB 3.2.26 (vedabase.io)
Kṛṣṇa encourages his parents; places Ugrasena on the throne; becomes the pupil of Sāndīpani...(Horace Hayman Wilson, 1840, Vishnu Purana, Chapter XXI, Book V). Sāndīpani (सान्दीिनन ) is preceptor of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra Rāma from whom they learned all the Vedas, art of drawing, astronomy, gāndharva Veda, medicine, training elephants and horses and archery.

At the yajna that Kamsa had arranged, a bow was to be worshipped. Krishna and Balarama asked various guards where this bow was being kept. They arrived at that room and Krishna proceeded to tie a string to the bow. But the bow snapped and the sound of the bow snapping was heard throughout the palace. The guards came and attacked Krishna and Balarama, but the two brothers killed all the guards.
By then, Kamsa had got to know that Krishna and Balarama had come to Mathura. So he called Chanura and Mushtika and told them to go and wrestle with the two brothers and kill them. He also called the servant who was in charge of his elephant known as Kubalayapida at the main gate to the palace. It was night. After issuing these instructions, Kamsa waited for morning.

When it was morning, arrangements were made for the wrestling match. There were ordinary seats for ordinary citizens around the arena where the match was to take palace. Kings and special guests had special seats reserved for them. Kamsa sat on the highest seat of all. The women sat behind a partition. Amongst the spectators were Nanda and the cowherds, Vasudeva, Akrura and Devaki.
Marital music started to be played. Chanura and Mushtika stood in the middle of the arena, exhibiting their strength. Krishna and Balarama entered the arena. At the main gate they had killed the elephant Kubalayuapida and they carried the bloody tusks in their hands.
The schedule was that Krishna would fight with Chanura and Balarama would fight with Mushtika. The first wrestling match between Krishna and Chanura began. It was a terrible bout to behold. Both were strong fighters. But eventually, Krishna raised Chanura’s body aloft and whirled it around a hundred times before throwing Chandura down on the ground. Chanura died. Meanwhile Balarama had started to fight with Mushtika. He hit Mushtika’s head and chest with his fists and thighs. And he grasped Mushtika so hard that the breath of life went out of Mushtika’s body. Krishna also killed another wrestler whose name was Toshalaka.
Kamsa was very angry. He instructed his guards to capture Krishna and Balarama and tie them up in iron chains. The guards were also to chain up Vasudeva and the cowherds.
But Krishna merely laughed. He jumped up on the stage where Kamsa was sitting and caught hold of Kamsa’s hair. He threw Kamsa down on the ground and Kamsa, the son of Ugrasena, died. Krishna pulled the dead body down to the arena. Kamsa’s body was so heavy that a huge pit was created where the dead body was placed.
Kamsa had a brother called Sumali and Sumali attacked Krishna and Balarama. But Balarama killed Sumali very easily. Krishna and Balarama then ent and met Vasudeva and Devaki.
Kamsa had imprisoned his own father Ugrasena. Krishna released Ugrasena from the prison and made him king. Krishna also obtained a beautiful assembly hall named Sudharma from Indra. This he repesented to King Ugrasena.
Since Kamsa was now dead, it was time for Krishna and Balarama to go to their guru’s house for studying. Their guru was a sage named Sandipani, who lived in Kashi. There Krishna and Balarama went to learn amongst other things, the art of fighting. It took them only sixty-four days to learn all this. After the shishya’s studies are completed he has to give a dakshina to his guru. Sandipani’s son had died and as a guru dakshina, Sandipani desired that his dead son might be brought back to life.
After death, the sage Sandipani’s son had gone to the great ocean. Krishna and Balarma took up their weapons and went to the ocean to demand the son. The ocean told them that the son was actually with a daitya named Panchajana who had the form of a conch-shell. Krishna entered the ocean and killed it. From the skeleton of the daitya was made the conch-shell Panchajanya that Krishna blows. To get back

the dead son, Krishna and Balarama also had to go to Yama’s world and defeat Yama. They did that and returned the son to the sage Sandipani.

Thereafter, a series of events unfolded, narrated in the Great Epic, the Mahābhārata.
The challenge faced by astronomers is to firmly anchor the kālagaņanā (chronology) of events of the Great War of ca. 4th m. BCE.
Kali Yuga Timeline [quote]...Hindu kālagaņanā (chronology) does not depend on any mundane event like the birth of a person, coronation of a king or the military success of an emperor. But it depends only on the movements of various heavenly bodies in the cosmos, or in other words, on astronomical science. Since a year of the devas equals 360 years of men, the extent of Kali Yuga is 432,000 years; According to the Surya Siddhanta, an astronomical treatise that forms the basis of all Hindu and Buddhist calendars, Kali Yuga began at midnight (00:00) on 18 February 3102 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar or 23 January 3102 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
In The Aihole Inscription 3735 years after the Bharata war is equated with 556 years of the Saka Era, in the Kali Yuga. This would mean 3179 years after the Bharata war, the Saka Era started. Whitaker’s alamanac says that Year 1922 in the Saka calendar is 2000 AD/CE. So the Saka year started in 78 BCE. That would imply that the Kaliyuga started in 3179-78= 3101 B
