Significance
This paper illustrates the potential of machine learning-based classification of multisensor, Multitemporal satellite data for the remote detection and mapping of archaeological mounded s e t t l e m e n t s i n a r i d e n v i r o n m e n t s . Our research integrates multitemporal synthetic a p e r t u r e r a d a r a n d m u l t i s p e c t r a l bands to produce a highly accurate probability field of mound signatures.The results largely expand the known concentra-tion of Indus settlements in the Cholistan Desert in Pakistan(ca. 3300 to 1500 BC), with the detection of hundreds of new sites deeper in the desert than previously suspected including several large-sized (>30 ha) urban centers.These distribution patterns have major implications regarding the influence of climate change and desertification in the collapse of the largest of the Old-World Bronze Age civilizations. Abstract
This paper presents an innovative multisensor, multitemporalmachinelearning approach using remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Cholistan (Pakistan).The Cholistan Desert presents

one of the largest concentrations of Indus Civilization sites (from ca 3 3 0 0 t o 1 5 0 0 B C ) . C h o l i s t a n has figured prominently in theories about changes in water availability, the rise and decline of the Indus Civilization, and the trans-formation of fertile monsoonal alluvial plains into an extremelyarid margin. This paper implements a multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach for the remote detection of archaeological mounds. A classifier algorithm that employs a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral images hasbeen implemented in Google Earth Engine, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures across an area that covers ca. 36,000 km2 . The results show that the area presents many more archaeological mounds than previously recorded, extending south and east into the desert, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. The detection of small (<5 ha) to large mounds (>30 ha) suggests that there were continuous shifts in settlement location. These shifts arelikely to reflect responses to a dynamic and changing hydrological network and the influence of the progressive northward advance of the desert in a long-term process that culminated in the abandonment of much of the settled area during the Late Harappan period.
