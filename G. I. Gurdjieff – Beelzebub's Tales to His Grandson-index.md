G.I.GURDJIEFF
Beelzebub's
Tales to His
Grandson
An Objectively Impartial
Criticism of the Life of Man
ALL AND EVERYTHING / FIRST SERIES



Ten Books in Three Series
FIRST SERIES Three books under the title of Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson. An Objectively Impartial Criticism of the Life of Man.
SECOND SERIES Two books under the common title of Meetings with Remarkable Men.
THIRD SERIES Five books under the title of Life Is Real Only Then, When "I Am. "
All written according to entirely new principles of logical reasoning and directed toward the accomplishment of the following three fundamental tasks:
FIRST SERIES To destroy, mercilessly and without any compromise whatever, in the mentation and feelings of the reader, the beliefs and views, by centuries rooted in him, about everything existing in the world.
SECOND SERIES To acquaint the reader with the material required for a new creation and to prove the soundness and good quality of it.
THIRD SERIES To assist the arising, in the mentation and in the feelings of the reader, of a veritable, nonfantastic representation not of that illusory world which he now perceives, but of the world existing in reality.



FRIENDLY ADVICE
(Written impromptu by the author on delivering this
book, already prepared for publication, to the
printer)
According to the numerous deductions and conclusions resulting from my
research concerning the profit contemporary people can obtain from new
impressions coming from what they read or hear, and also according to the
thought of one of the sayings of popular wisdom I have just remembered,
handed down to our days from very ancient times,
"Any prayer may be heard and granted by the Higher Powers only if it is
uttered thrice:
First—for the welfare or the peace of the souls of one's parents,
Second—for the welfare of one's neighbor, And only third—for oneself
personally," I find it necessary on the first page of this book, now ready for
publication, to give the following advice "Read each of my written
expositions thrice First—at least as you have already become mechanized to
read all your contemporary books and newspapers,
Second—as if you were reading aloud to another person, And only third—try
to fathom the gist of my writings Only then will you be able to count upon
forming your own impartial judgment, proper to yourself alone, on my
writings And only then can my hope be actualized that according to your
understanding you will obtain the specific benefit for yourself which I
anticipate, and which I wish for you with all my being.



FIRST BOOK



CHAPTER 1
The arousing of thought
AMONG ALL the convictions formed in my "common presence" during my
responsible, peculiarly composed life, there is one unshakable conviction that
people—whatever the degree of development of their understanding and
whatever the form taken by the factors present in their individuality for
engendering all kinds of ideals—always and everywhere on the Earth feel the
imperative need, on beginning anything new, to pronounce aloud, or if not
aloud at least mentally, that particular invocation understandable to even the
most ignorant person, which has been formulated in different ways in different
epochs, and in our day is expressed in the following words "In the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Amen."
That is why I now also, in setting forth on this venture quite new for me,
namely authorship, begin by pronouncing this invocation, and pronounce it
not only aloud but even very distinctly and, as the ancient Toulousites used to
say, with a "fully manifested intonation"—of course only to the extent
permitted by data already formed in my whole presence and thoroughly rooted
in it for such a manifestation, data, by the way, which are generally formed in
man's nature during his preparatory years, and which later, during his
responsible life, determine the character and vivifyingness of such an
intonation.
Having begun thus, I can now be quite at ease and should even, according
to contemporary notions of "religious morality," be completely assured that
from now on everything in this new venture of mine will proceed, as is said,
"like a pianola."



In any case, this is the way I have begun, and how the rest will go I can
only say, as the blind man put it, "we shall see."
First and foremost, I shall place my hand, moreover the right one, which
although at the moment it is slightly injured due to an accident that recently
befell me—is nevertheless really my own, and has never once failed me in all
my life, on my heart, of course also my own—but on the constancy or
inconstancy of this part of my whole I see no need to expatiate here—and
frankly confess that I myself have not the slightest wish to write, but am
constrained to do so by circumstances quite independent of me, though
whether these circumstances arose accidentally or were created intentionally
by extraneous forces I do not yet know I only know that these circumstances
bid me write not just some trifle for reading oneself to sleep, but thick and
weighty tomes.
However that may be, I begin . . . But begin with what? Oh, the devil! Will there indeed be repeated that strange and extremely
unpleasant sensation it befell me to experience about three weeks ago, while
I was composing in my thoughts the scheme and sequence of the ideas I
intended to publish and did not know then, either, how to begin?
This sensation I could only describe in these words "the fear of drowning in the overflow of my own thoughts." To stop this disagreeable sensation I might still have had recourse to that
maleficent property inherent in me, as in all contemporary people, which
enables us, without experiencing any remorse of conscience whatever, to put
off anything we wish to do "till tomorrow "
I could have done this very easily because before beginning the actual
writing there seemed to be plenty of time, but today this is no longer so and,
cost what it may, "even though I burst," I must begin.



But begin with what? Hurrah! . . . Eureka! Almost all the books I have happened to read in my life have begun with a
preface. So I too must begin with something of the kind.
I say "of the kind." because in my entire life, from the moment I began to
distinguish a boy from a girl, I have always done everything, absolutely
everything, not as it is done by other, like myself, biped destroyers of
Nature's good. Therefore I ought now, and am perhaps even bound on
principle, to begin not as any other writer would.
In any case, instead of the conventional preface I shall begin quite simply
with a warning.
Beginning with a warning will be most judicious on my part, if only
because it will not contradict any of my principles, whether organic, psychic,
or even "willful" At the same time it will be quite honest—honest, of course,
in the objective sense, since I expect without the least doubt, as do all those
who know me well, that owing to my writings there will entirely disappear in
the majority of readers— immediately and not gradually, as sooner or later
must occur to everyone—all the "treasures" they have acquired, either by
inheritance or by their own labor, in the form of "quieting notions" that evoke
only romantic images of their present lives or naive dreams about the future
Professional writers usually begin such introductions with an address to
the reader full of all kinds of bombastic, magniloquent, and so to say
"honeyed" and inflated phrases.
In this alone I shall follow their example and also begin with an "address
to the reader," but I shall try not to make it as sugary as they usually do with
their evil wiseacring, by which they titillate the sensibilities of the more or
less normal reader.



Thus . . . My dear, highly honored, strong-willed, and of course very patient Sirs,
and my very dear, charming, and impartial Ladies—forgive me, I have
omitted the most important— my in no wise hysterical Ladies!
I have the honor to inform you that although, due to circumstances that
have arisen in one of the later stages of my life, I am now going to write
books, during my whole life I have never written a single book or "instructive
article," or even a letter in which it was necessary to observe what is called
"grammaticality," so that although I am about to become a "professional
writer" I have no practice at all in the established rules and procedures or in
what is called "bon ton literary language," and am therefore constrained to
write not as ordinary "patented" writers do, to whose form of writing you are
in all probability as much accustomed as to your own smell.
In my opinion, what will be troublesome for you in all this is chiefly that
in childhood there was implanted in you—and has now become perfectly
harmonized with your general psyche—an excellently working automatism
for perceiving all kinds of new impressions, thanks to which "blessing" you
have now, during your responsible life, no need to make any individual effort
whatsoever.
To speak frankly, I personally see the central point of my confession not in
my lack of experience in the rules and procedures of writers, but in my
ignorance of what I have called "bon ton literary language," required in
contemporary life not only of authors but even of all ordinary mortals.
As regards the former, that is to say, my lack of experience in the rules and
procedures of writers, I am not greatly disturbed. And I am not disturbed,
because in the life of contemporary people this lack of experience is in the
order of things.
This new "blessing" arose and is flourishing everywhere



on Earth thanks to an extraordinary disease which, for the last twenty or thirty
years, for some reason or other, has afflicted all those persons from among the
three sexes who sleep with half-open eyes, and whose faces are fertile soil for
the growth of every kind of pimple.
This strange disease is manifested thus if the invalid is somewhat literate
and his rent is paid for three months in advance, he, she, or it inevitably starts
writing some "instructive article," if not a whole book.
Knowing all about this new human disease and its epidemic spread on
Earth, I naturally have the right to assume that you have acquired "immunity"
to it, as the "medical experts" would say, and that you will therefore not be
too indignant at my lack of experience in the rules and procedures of writers
That is why I make the center of gravity of my warning my ignorance of
"bon ton literary language."
In self-justification, and also perhaps to lessen the disapproval in your
waking consciousness of my ignorance of this language indispensable for
contemporary life, I consider it necessary to say, with humble heart and
cheeks flushed with shame, that although I too was taught this language in my
childhood, and although some of my elders who prepared me for responsible
life constantly forced me, without sparing any means of intimidation, to learn
by rote the host of nuances that in their totality compose this contemporary
"delight," yet unfortunately, of course for you, of all that I learned by rote
nothing stuck, and nothing whatever has survived for my present activities as
a writer.
And if nothing stuck, it was not through any fault of mine or of my former
"respected" and "nonrespected" teachers This human labor was spent in vain
owing to an unexpected and quite exceptional event that occurred at the
moment of my appearance on God's Earth, at which moment—as a certain
well-known European occultist explained to me after



very minute what are called "psycho-physico-astrological" investigationsthrough the hole in the window pane made by our crazy lame goat, there poured vibrations of sound from an Edison phonograph in the neighbor's house, while the midwife who delivered me had in her mouth a lozenge saturated with cocaine of German make, moreover not ersatz, which she was sucking to the sound of the music without the proper enjoyment. Aside from this event, rare in the everyday life of people, my present situation also came about because later on in my preparatory and adult lifeas, I must confess, I myself surmised after long reflection based on the method of the German professor Herr Stumpfsinnschmausen—I always, both instinctively and automatically, and sometimes even consciously, that is, on principle, avoided using this language for intercourse with others. And I manifested myself thus in regard to this trifle, perhaps not such a trifle, thanks to three data formed in my entirety during my preparatory ageabout which data I intend to inform you in this first chapter of my writings However that may be, the fact remains, illuminated from every side like an American advertisement—which fact cannot now be changed by any forces, even with the know-how of the "experts in monkey business"—that I, who have in recent years been considered by many people a rather good teacher of temple dances, have today become a professional writer, and will of course write a great deal—as it has been proper to me since childhood whenever I do anything to do a great deal of it—nevertheless, not having, as you see, the automatically acquired and automatically manifested practice needed for this, I shall be obliged to write all I have thought out in the plain, simple everyday language established by life, without any "literary manipulations" or "grammatical wiseacrings."



But the pot is not yet full! . . . I have still not decided the most important question of all in which language to write. Although I have begun to write in Russian, nevertheless in that language,
as the wisest of the wise, Mullah Nasr Eddin, would say, "you cannot go far.
"*
The Russian language is very good—it cannot be denied I even like it, but
only for swapping anecdotes and for referring to someone's parentage.
The Russian language is like the English, which is also very good, but only
for discussing in "smoking rooms," while settled in an easy chair with legs
stretched out on another one, the topic of "Australian frozen meat" or, per
haps, the "Indian question."
Both these languages are like the dish known in Moscow as "solianka," into
which goes anything and everything except you and me—in fact, everything
you wish, even the after-dinner "cheshma"† of Scheherazade.
It must also be said that owing to all kinds of conditions accidentally, or
perhaps not accidentally, formed in my youth, I have had to learn, very
seriously and of course always with self-compulsion, to speak, read, and write
a great many languages, and to such a degree of fluency that if in following
this profession unexpectedly forced on me by fate I decided not to take
advantage of the "automatism" acquired by practice, I could perhaps write in
any one of them.
But in order to make judicious use of this automatism acquired by long
practice, I would have to write either in
* Mullah Nasr Eddin or as he is also called Nasr Eddin Hodja is little known in Europe and America but is very well known in all the countries of the continent of Asia He is a legendary personage corresponding somewhat to the German Till Eulenspiegel Many popular tales and savings are attributed to this Nasr Eddin some of long standing and others more recent all expressing "life wisdom."
† "Cheshma" means veil



Russian or in Armenian, because during the last two or three decades the
circumstances of my life have been such that I have had to use just these two
languages for communication with others, and consequently have had more
practice in them.
Oh the devil! Even in a case like this, one of the aspects of my peculiar
psyche, unusual for a normal man, has already begun to torment the whole of
me.
And the "torment" I feel at this moment, at my almost too mellow age, is
derived from a property implanted in childhood in my peculiar psyche, with a
lot of rubbish unnecessary for contemporary life, that automatically compels
the whole of me always and in everything to act only according to popular
wisdom.
In the present case, as always when I am in doubt, there has just slipped
uninvited into my brain, which is constructed unsuccessfully to the point of
mockery, that saying of popular wisdom which existed in very ancient times
and which has come down to our day in the following words "Every stick has
two ends."
In trying to understand the underlying thought and real meaning hidden in
this strange formulation, any more or less sane-thinking man will, in my
opinion, soon come to the conclusion that all the ideas contained in this
saying are based on the truth, recognized by people for centuries, that every
phenomenon in the life of man is due to two causes of opposite character, and
divides into two exactly opposite results, which in their turn become the
cause of new phenomena For example, if "something" obtained from two
opposing causes produces light, then this "something" must also inevitably
produce the opposite phenomenon, that is, darkness, or again, if a factor
engenders an impulse of palpable satisfaction in the organism of a living
creature, it likewise inevitably engenders dissatisfaction, of course also
palpable, and so on and so forth, always and in everything.



Adopting here this example of popular wisdom formed in the course of
centuries and expressed by the image of a stick, which as was said has indeed
two ends, one end considered good and the other bad, then if I take advantage
of the mentioned automatism acquired by me through long practice, it will of
course be very good for me personally, but according to this saying, for the
reader it will be just the opposite; and what the opposite of good is, even
every nonpossessor of hemorrhoids can easily understand.
In short, if I exercise my prerogative and take the good end of the stick, the
bad end will inevitably fall "on the reader's head."
This may indeed happen, for in Russian it is impossible to express the so to
say niceties of philosophical questions, which I intend to touch upon in my
writings rather fully; whereas, although it is possible to do so in Armenian,
this language, to the misfortune of all contemporary Armenians, has now
become quite impractical for expressing contemporary notions.
In order to assuage the bitterness of my inner hurt owing to this, I must say
that in my early youth, when I became interested in philological questions and
was deeply absorbed in them, I preferred the Armenian language to all the
others I then spoke, even including my native tongue.
This language was my favorite at that time chiefly because it had its own
character and had nothing in common with the neighboring or kindred
languages All its "tonalities," as the learned philologists say, were peculiar to
it alone and, as I understood even then, it corresponded perfectly to the
psyche of the people of that nation.
But during the last thirty or forty years I have witnessed such a change in
this language that although it has not completely lost the originality and
independence it had possessed since the remote past, it has now become a sort
of "clownish potpourri of languages" whose consonances, falling on the



ear of a more or less attentive and conscious listener, sound like a collection
of Turkish, Persian, French, Kurdish, and Russian tones, mixed with other
"indigestible" and inarticulate noises.
Almost the same might be said about my native language, Greek, which I
spoke in childhood, and the taste of whose "automatic associative power" I
still retain. I could, I dare say, express anything I wish in it even now, but it is
impossible for me to employ it here for the simple and rather comical reason
that someone must transcribe my writings and translate them into other
languages. And who could do this?
It can be said with certainty that even the best expert in modern Greek
would understand simply nothing of what I would write in the tongue I
assimilated in childhood, because during the last thirty or forty years my dear
"compatriots," inflamed with the desire to be at all costs like the represen
tatives of contemporary civilization even in their conversation, have treated
my dear native language just as the Armenians, anxious to become Russian
"intelligentsia," have treated theirs.
The Greek language whose spirit and essence were transmitted to me by
heredity and the language now spoken by contemporary Greeks are as much
alike as, according to the expression of Mullah Nasr Eddin, "a nail is like a
requiem."
So what is now to be done? Ah me! Never mind, esteemed buyer of my wiseacrings. As long as there is
plenty of French armagnac and Khaizarian "bastourma," I shall find a way
even out of this tight corner.
I am an old hand at this. In life, I have so often gotten into difficult situations and out of them that
this has become almost a matter of habit with me.
Meanwhile, I shall write partly in Russian and partly in Armenian, all the
more since among those people always



hanging around me there are several who know how to get along more or less
easily in both these languages, and I somehow entertain the hope that they
will be able to transcribe and translate them fairly well for me.
In any case I repeat, and repeat so that you may remember it well—not as you
are in the habit of "remembering" other things, and on the basis of which you
are accustomed to keeping your word of honor to others or to yourself—that
no matter what language I use, I shall always and in everything avoid what I
have called "bon ton literary language."
With regard to this it is an extremely curious fact, perhaps more worthy of
your love of knowledge than you may suppose, that from my earliest
childhood, that is to say, ever since the birth in me of the need to rob birds'
nests and to tease my friends' sisters, there arose in my "planetary body," as
the ancient theosophists called it, and moreover—why I don't know—chiefly
in the right half, an involuntary, instinctive sensation that up to the period of
my life when I became a "teacher of dancing" was gradually formed into a
definite feeling, and later, when thanks to this profession of mine I came in
contact with people of many different types, the conviction also began to
arise in what is called my "mind" that these languages, or rather their
"grammars," are composed by people who with respect to knowledge of
language are exactly like those biped animals whom the esteemed Mullah
Nasr Eddin characterizes thus "All they can do is wrangle with pigs about the
quality of oranges."
People of this kind, who, due to rotten heredity and nauseating upbringing,
on reaching a certain age have been turned into "voracious moths,"
destroying the good prepared and left for us by our ancestors and by time,
have not the slightest notion and have never even heard of the blatantly
obvious fact that during preparatory age there is acquired in the brain
functioning of every creature, and thus



of man also, a definite property whose automatic manifestations proceed
according to a certain law that the ancient Korkolans called the "law of
associations," and that the process of mentation of every creature, especially
man, flows exclusively in accordance with this law.
Since I have happened to touch upon a question that has recently become
almost an "obsession" of mine, namely, the process of human mentation, I
consider it possible, without waiting for the place in my writings I had
designated for the elucidation of this question, to speak at least a little in this
first chapter about some information that accidentally became known to me
According to this information, it was customary in long-past centuries on
Earth for every man bold enough to aspire to the right to be considered by
others and to consider himself a "conscious thinker" to be instructed, while
still in the early years of his responsible existence, that man has two kinds of
mentation one kind, mentation by thought, expressed by words always
possessing a relative meaning, and another kind, proper to all animals as well
as to man, which I would call "mentation by form."
The second kind of mentation, that is, "mentation by form"—through
which, by the way, the exact meaning of all writing should be perceived and
then assimilated after conscious confrontation with information previously
acquired—is determined in people by the conditions of geographical locality,
climate, time, and in general the whole environment in which they have arisen
and in which their existence has flowed up to adulthood.
Thus, in the brains of people of different races living in different
geographical localities under different conditions, there arise in regard to one
and the same thing or idea quite different independent forms, which during
the flow of associations evoke in their being a definite sensation giving



rise to a definite picturing, and this picturing is expressed by some word or
other that serves only for its outer subjective expression.
That is why each word for the same thing or idea almost always acquires
for people of different geographical localities and races a quite specific and
entirely different so to say "inner content."
In other words, if in the "presence" of a man who has arisen and grown up
in a given locality a certain "form" has been fixed as a result of specific local
influences and impressions, this "form" evokes in him by association the
sensation of a definite "inner content," and consequently a definite picturing
or concept, for the expression of which he uses some word that has become
habitual and, as I said, subjective to him, but the hearer of that word—in
whose being, owing to the different conditions of his arising and growth, a
form with a different "inner content" has been fixed for the given word—will
always perceive and infallibly understand that word in quite another sense.
This fact, by the way, can be clearly established by attentive and impartial
observation during an exchange of opinions between persons belonging to
different races or who arose and were formed in different geographical
localities.
And so, cheerful and swaggering candidate for a buyer of my "wiseacrings,"
having warned you that I am going to write not as professional writers usually
do but quite otherwise, I advise you to reflect seriously before you embark on
reading my further expositions, and only then to undertake it Otherwise, I am
afraid that your hearing and other perceptive as well as digestive organs may
be so thoroughly automatized to the "literary language of the intelligentsia"
prevailing at the present time on Earth that these writings of mine might affect
you very, very cacophonously, and thereby you might lose . . . do you know
what? . . . your



appetite for your favorite dish, and that special psychic feature of yours which
particularly "titillates your vitals" on catching sight of your neighbor, the
brunette.
That my language, or rather the form of my mentation, can produce such
an effect I am, thanks to repeated past experiences, as much convinced with
my whole being as a "thoroughbred donkey" is convinced of the rightness and
justice of his obstinacy.
Now that I have warned you of what is most important, I am tranquil about
all that will follow. For if any misunderstanding should arise on account of my
writings, you alone will be to blame, and my conscience will be as clear as for
instance . . . ex-Kaiser Wilhelm's.
In all probability you are now thinking that I am a young man with an
"auspicious exterior" and, as some express it, "suspicious interior," and that,
as a novice at writing, I am deliberately trying to be eccentric in the hope of
becoming famous and thereby rich.
If you really think so, you are very, very mistaken. First of all, I am not young I have already lived so much that, as is said, I
have not only been "through the mill" but "through all the grindstones"; and
second, I am not writing in order to make a career for myself, or to "plant
myself firmly on my own feet" by means of this profession which, I must add,
in my opinion provides for those who practice it many openings to become
candidates direct for Hell— assuming of course that such people can in fact
perfect their being to that extent—because, knowing nothing whatever
themselves, they write all kinds of "claptrap" and, thus automatically
acquiring authority, they develop year by year one of the chief factors for the
weakening of the psyche of people, already sufficiently weakened without this
And as regards my personal career, thanks to all forces high and low and, if
you like, even right and left, I have



established it long ago, and have long been standing on "firm feet" and, it may
be, on very good feet I am certain moreover that their strength will suffice for
many more years, to the dismay of all my past, present, and future enemies.
Yes. . . I think I might as well tell you about an idea that has only just
arisen in my madcap brain, which is specially to request the printer to whom I
shall entrust my first book to print this initial chapter of my writings in such a
way that anybody can read it without cutting the pages of the book itself,
whereupon, on learning that it is not written in the usual manner, that is, to
help produce in the mind of the reader, very smoothly and easily, exciting
images and lulling reveries, he may if he wishes, without wasting words with
the bookseller, return it and get his money back, money perhaps earned by the
sweat of his brow.
And I shall do this without fail because I have just remembered the story of
what happened to a certain Trans-caucasian Kurd, a story I heard in my early
youth and which in later years, whenever I recalled it in similar cases, aroused
in me an enduring and inextinguishable impulse of tenderness I think it will
be very useful for me, as well as for you, if I relate this story in some detail.
It will be useful chiefly because I have already decided to make the "salt"
or, as contemporary "pure-blooded" Jewish businessmen would say, the
"tzimmes" of this story one of the basic principles of that new literary form I
intend to use for attaining the aim I am now pursuing in this new profession
of mine.
This Transcaucasian Kurd once set out from his village on some business
or other to town, and there in the market he saw in a fruit stall a handsomely
arranged display of all kinds of fruit.
In this display he noticed one particular fruit, very beautiful in both color
and form, and its appearance so took his



fancy and he so longed to try it that in spite of having scarcely any money he
decided come what may to buy at least one of these gifts of Great Nature, and
taste it.
Then with intense eagerness and a boldness not customary to him, he
entered the shop and, pointing with his horny finger at the fruit that had taken
his fancy, asked the shopkeeper its price The shopkeeper replied that a pound
of the fruit cost six coppers.
Finding that the price was not at all high for what in his opinion was such
beautiful fruit, our Kurd decided to buy a whole pound.
Having finished his business in town, he set off again on foot for home
that same day.
Walking at sunset over the hills and dales, and willy-nilly perceiving the
exterior aspect of those enchanting parts of the bosom of Great Nature, our
Common Mother, and involuntarily inhaling the pure air, uncontaminated by
the usual exhalations of industrial towns, our Kurd quite naturally felt a
sudden wish to gratify himself with some ordinary food also, so sitting down
by the side of the road, he took some bread from his provision bag and the
"fruits" that had looked so good to him, and leisurely began to eat.
But. . . horror of horrors! . . . very soon everything inside him began to
burn.
Yet in spite of this he kept on eating. And this hapless biped creature of our planet kept on eating, thanks only to
that particular human inherency I mentioned, the principle of which I have
decided to use as the basis of the new literary form I have created, and which
will serve as a "guiding beacon" leading me to one of my aims You will, I am
sure, soon grasp the sense and meaning of this—of course according to the
degree of your comprehension—during the reading of any subsequent chapter
of my writings, that is, if you take the risk and read further,



or perhaps even at the end of this first chapter you will already "smell"
something.
And so, just at the moment when our Kurd was overwhelmed by all the
unusual sensations aroused within him by this strange repast on the bosom of
Nature, there came along the same road a fellow villager of his, reputed by
those who knew him to be very clever and experienced, and seeing that the
whole face of the Kurd was aflame and that his eyes were streaming with
tears, and that in spite of this, as if intent upon the fulfillment of his most
important duty, he was eating real "red pepper pods," he said to him
"What are you doing, you Jericho jackass? You'll be burnt alive! Stop
eating that barbarous stuff, so foreign to your nature."
But our Kurd replied "No, for nothing on Earth will I stop. Didn't I pay my
last six coppers for them? Even if my soul departs from my body, I will go on
eating."
Whereupon our resolute Kurd—it must of course be assumed that he was
such—did not stop, but went on eating the red peppers.
After what you have just perceived, I hope there may already be arising in
your mentation a corresponding association, which should finally lead you, as
sometimes happens with certain people, to what you call "understanding "
And then you will understand why I—well knowing and having often felt pity
for this human inherency, whose inevitable manifestation is that if anybody
pays money for something he is bound to use it to the end—was animated in
my whole presence by the idea that arose in my mentation of taking every
possible measure so that you, my "brother in appetite and in spirit," as they
say—in the event of your being accustomed to reading books written
exclusively in the "language of the intelligentsia"—having already paid
money for my writings, and discovering only afterward that they



are not written in the usual convenient and easily read language, should not be
compelled to read them through to the end at any cost, as our poor
Transcaucasian Kurd was compelled to go on eating what he had fancied for
its appearance alone—that not-to-be-joked-with, noble "red pepper."
And so, to avoid any misunderstanding on account of this property, which
arises from data formed in the "presence" of contemporary man thanks to his
frequenting the cinema and never missing an opportunity of looking into the
left eye of persons of the other sex, I wish to have this opening chapter of
mine printed in the said manner, so that everyone can read it through without
cutting the pages of the book itself.
Otherwise the bookseller will, as is said, "cavil," and behave without fail
according to the basic principle of all booksellers, formulated in the following
words "You are more a fool than a fisherman if you let go the fish that has
swallowed the bait," and will decline to take back a book whose pages have
been cut I have no doubt that this would happen Indeed, I fully expect such
lack of conscience on the part of the booksellers.
My certainty about this lack of conscience on the part of booksellers
comes from data formed in me during the period when I was a professional
"Indian fakir" and, in order to clarify a certain "ultraphilosophical" question, I
had to become familiar with the associative process of the manifestation of
the automatically constructed psyche in contemporary booksellers and their
salesmen, when palming off books on their buyers.
Knowing all this and having become, since the accident that befell me, just
and fastidious in the extreme, I cannot help repeating, or rather I cannot help
warning you again and even insistently advising you, before beginning to cut



the pages of this first book of mine, to read very attentively, even more than once, this first chapter of my writings. But if notwithstanding this warning of mine you still wish to become
acquainted with the rest of my expositions, there is nothing left for me but to
wish you with all my "genuine soul" a very, very good "appetite," and that
you may "digest" everything you read, not only for your own health but for
the health of all those near you.
I said "with my genuine soul" because recently, living here in Europe, and
frequently meeting people who on every appropriate and inappropriate
occasion are fond of taking in vain sacred names that belong only to man's
inner life, that is to say, of swearing to no purpose, and being, as I have
already confessed, a follower—not only in theory, like contemporary people,
but also in practice—of the sayings of popular wisdom established throughout
the centuries, among which is one that corresponds to the present case and is
expressed in the words "When you are in Rome do as the Romans do"—in
order not to be out of harmony with the custom established here in Europe of
swearing in ordinary conversation, and at the same time to act according to
the commandment enunciated by the holy lips of Saint Moses not to take the
sacred names in vain—I decided to make use of one of the oddities of that
freshly baked fashionable language called "English," and each time the occa
sion requires it, to swear by my "English soul."
The point is that in this fashionable language the word for "soul" and the
word for the bottom of the foot, also "sole," are pronounced and even written
almost alike.
I do not know how it is for you, who are already half a candidate for a
buyer of my writings, but as for me, no matter how great my mental desire,
my peculiar nature cannot avoid being indignant at this manifestation of
people of contemporary civilization, whereby the very highest in man,



particularly beloved by our Common Father Creator, can be named and often
understood as that which is lowest and dirtiest in man.
Well, enough of "philologizing." Let us return to the main task of this initial
chapter, intended, among other things, to stir up my drowsy thoughts as well
as yours, and also to give the reader a warning.
I have already composed in my head the plan and sequence of my intended
expositions, but what form they will take on paper, speaking frankly, I do not
yet know with my consciousness; but in my subconscious, I already definitely
feel that on the whole they will take the form of something, so to say, "hot,"
and will act on the common presence of every reader just as the red pepper
pods did on the poor Transcaucasian Kurd.
Now that you have become familiar with the story of our common
countryman, the Transcaucasian Kurd, I consider it my duty to make a
confession to you. Before going on with this first chapter, which serves as an
introduction to all that I plan to write, I wish to inform your so-called "pure
waking consciousness" of the fact that, in the chapters following this warning,
I shall expound my thoughts intentionally in such a sequence and with such
logical confrontation that the essence of certain real ideas may pass
automatically from this "waking consciousness," which most people in their
ignorance mistake for the real consciousness, but which I affirm and
experimentally prove is the fictitious one, into what you call the
"subconscious"— which in my opinion ought to be the real human con
sciousness—in order that these concepts may mechanically bring about by
themselves that transformation which in general should proceed in the
common presence of a man and give him, by means of his own active
mentation, the



results proper to him as a man and not merely as a one- or two-brained animal I decided to do this without fail so that this introductory chapter, intended
as I have already said to awaken your consciousness, may fully justify its
purpose and, reaching not only your, in my opinion, "fictitious
consciousness" but also your real consciousness, that is to say, what you call
your "subconscious," may compel you for the first time to reflect actively.
In the "presence" of every man, irrespective of his heredity and education,
there are formed two independent consciousnesses, having almost nothing in
common either in their functioning or in their manifestations.
One consciousness is formed from the perception of all kinds of
mechanical impressions, arising accidentally or deliberately produced by
others, including almost all words, which are indeed only empty "sounds",
and the other consciousness is formed partly from the "previously fixed ma
terial results" transmitted to a man by heredity, which have become blended
with the corresponding parts of his common presence, and partly from his
intentionally evoked associative confrontations of these "materialized results
This second human consciousness, which in itself as well as in its
manifestations is none other than what is called the "subconscious," and
which is formed, as I have just said, from the "materialized results" of
heredity and the confrontations produced by a man's own intention, is the one
that in my opinion—based on many years of experimental investigations
carried out under exceptionally favorable conditions—should predominate in
his common presence.
In view of this conviction of mine, which doubtless seems to you the
fantasy of an afflicted mind, I cannot now, as you yourself see, disregard this
second consciousness, and am thus obliged by my essence to construct this
first chapter of



my writings, which should serve as a preface for all that follows, in such a
way that it will reach and, in the manner required for my aim, "ruffle" the
perceptions accumulated in both these consciousnesses of yours.
Continuing my exposition with this idea in mind, I must first of all inform
your fictitious consciousness that, thanks to three definite and peculiar
psychic data crystallized in my common presence during my preparatory age,
I am really "unique" at so to say "muddling and befuddling" all the notions
and convictions supposedly firmly fixed in the presences of people with
whom I come in contact.
Tut! Tut! Tut! I already sense that in your false—but according to you
"real"—consciousness there are beginning to be agitated, like horseflies, all
kinds of data bequeathed to you by heredity from your "uncle" and "mama,"
the totality of which, always and in everything, engenders in you the really
touching impulse of curiosity—in this instance, to find out as quickly as
possible why I, a mere novice at writing, whose name has not even once been
mentioned in the newspapers, have suddenly become unique.
Never mind! I personally am very pleased to see this curiosity arise in you,
even though only in your "false" consciousness, as I know from experience
that this impulse unworthy of man can sometimes change its nature and
become a worthy impulse called the "desire for knowledge," which in its turn
helps a contemporary man to perceive and even to understand more clearly
the essence of any object on which his attention happens to be concentrated,
and therefore I am willing and even glad to satisfy this curiosity that has
arisen in you So listen, and try to justify and not disappoint my expectations
This original personality of mine, already "sniffed out" by certain
Individuals from both choirs of the Judgment Seat Above whence Objective
Justice proceeds, and also here on



Earth by an as yet very limited number of people, is based, as I have already said, on three specific data formed in me at different times during my preparatory age. The first of these three data, from the moment of its arising, became as it were the chief directing lever of my entire whole, while the other two became the "vivifying sources" for the nourishing and perfecting of the first This first datum arose in me when I was still, as is said, a "chubby mite " My dear, now deceased, grandmother was then still alive and was a hundred and some years old. When my grandmother—may she attain the Kingdom of Heaven—was dying, my mother, as was then the custom, took me to her bedside and, as I kissed her right hand, my dear grandmother placed her dying left hand on my head and said in a whisper, yet very distinctly: "Eldest of my grandsons! Listen and always remember my strict injunction to you: In life never do as others do." Having said this, she gazed at the bridge of my nose and, evidently noticing
my perplexity and my obscure understanding of what she had said, added
somewhat angrily and imperiously:
"Either do nothing—just go to school—or do something nobody else does Whereupon she immediately, without hesitation and with a perceptible impulse of disdain for all around her, and with commendable self-cognizance, gave up her soul directly into the hands of His Faithfulness, the Archangel Gabriel. I think it will be interesting and perhaps even instructive for you to know that all this made so powerful an impression on me that I was suddenly unable to endure anyone around me, and as soon as we left the room where the mortal "planetary body" of the cause of the cause of my arising lay, I, very quietly, trying not to attract attention, stole away to the pit where, during Lent, the bran and potato peelings were stored for our "sanitarians," that is to say, our pigs.



And I lay there, without food or drink, in a tempest of whirling and confused thoughts—of which, fortunately for me, I still had only a very limited number in my childish brain— right until my mother's return from the cemetery, when the weeping that was shaking her after finding me absent and searching for me in vain "broke in" on me. At once I climbed out of the pit and stood a moment on the edge, for some reason or other with hands outstretched; then I ran to her and, clinging fast to her skirt, involuntarily began to stamp my feet and—why I don't know—to imitate the braying of the donkey that belonged to our neighbor, the bailiff. Why all this produced such a strong impression on me just then, and why I almost automatically behaved so strangely, I still cannot make out, though during recent years, particularly on the days known as "Shrovetide," I have pondered over it a great deal, trying to discover the reason. I have only reached the logical supposition that it was because the room where this sacred scene occurred, which was to have tremendous significance for the whole of my future life, was permeated through and through with the scent of a special incense brought from a monastery of Mount Athos and very popular among followers of every shade of belief of the Christian religion. Whatever it may have been, those are the facts. During the days following this event, nothing particular happened in my general state, unless it was that I walked more often than usual with my feet in the air, that is to say, on my hands. My first act that was obviously not in accord with the manifestations of others, though without the participation either of my consciousness or of my subconscious, occurred on exactly the fortieth day after my grandmother's death, when our family, our relatives, and all those who had esteemed my dear grandmother, who was loved by every



body, were gathered in the cemetery, as was the custom, to perform over her
mortal remains reposing in the grave what is called the "requiem service "
Suddenly, without rhyme or reason, instead of observing what was
conventional among people of all degrees of tangible and intangible morality
and of every station in life, that is, instead of standing quietly as if
overwhelmed, with an expression of grief on one's face and even if possible
with tears in one's eyes, I started skipping and dancing around the grave and
sang:
Let her with the saints repose, She was a rare one, goodness
knows! . . .
and so on and so forth. And from this moment on, as regards any form of "aping," that is, imitating
the habitual automatized manifestations of those around me, a "something"
always arose in my presence, engendering what I should now call an
"irresistible urge" to do things not as others do.
At that age, for example, I did such things as the following: when my
brother, sisters, and the neighbors' children who came to play with us were
learning to catch a ball only with the right hand, and threw it in the air, I
would first bounce the ball hard on the ground, and when it rebounded, after
first doing a somersault, would catch it, but only with the thumb and middle
finger of the left hand; or if all the other children slid down the hill headfirst, I
would try to do it, and moreover better and better each time, "backside first";
or if we were given various kinds of Abaramian pastries, and the others,
before putting them into their mouths, would first of all lick them, evidently
to try their flavor and prolong the pleasure, I would first sniff one on all sides
and perhaps even put it to my ear and listen intently, and then, almost
unconsciously, though very seriously, I would mutter to myself, "enough is
enough, you don't need to stuff!"



and humming to an appropriate rhythm, would swallow it whole without savoring it, and so on and so forth.
The first event that gave rise to one of the two data I mentioned, which
became the "vivifying sources" for nourishing and perfecting my deceased
grandmother's injunction, occurred just at the age when I changed from a
chubby mite into what is called a "young rascal," and had already begun, as is
sometimes said, to be a "candidate for a young man of pleasing appearance
and dubious content."
And this event occurred under the following circumstances, which were
perhaps even specially combined by Fate.
One day, with a number of young rascals like myself, I was setting snares
for pigeons on the roof of a neighbor's house, when suddenly one of the boys
who was standing over me and watching me closely said:
"I think the horsehair noose ought to be set so that the pigeon's big toe
never gets caught in it because, as our zoology teacher recently explained to
us, it is just in that toe that the pigeon's reserve strength is concentrated, and
of course if this big toe gets caught in the noose, the pigeon might easily
break it."
Another boy, leaning over just opposite me—from whose mouth, by the
way, whenever he spoke saliva always splashed abundantly in all directions
snapped at this remark of the first boy and delivered himself, with a copious
shower of saliva, of the following words:
"Shut your trap, you hopeless mongrel offshoot of the Hottentots! What an
abortion you are, just like your teacher' Even if it's true that the pigeon's
greatest physical force is concentrated in its big toe, then all the more reason
for seeing that just that toe gets caught in the noose Only then can there be
any importance for our aim—that is, catching these unfortunate pigeon
creatures—in a certain particularity



proper to all possessors of that soft and slippery 'something,' the brain, which
consists in this, that when, thanks to the action of other influences, on which
its insignificant power of manifestation depends, there arises what is called a
'change of presence,' periodically necessary according to law, the slight
confusion that should proceed for the intensification of other manifestations
of the general functioning immediately enables the center of gravity of the
whole organism, in which this slippery 'something' plays a very small part, to
shift temporarily from its usual place to another place, and this often leads to
unexpected results in the general functioning, ridiculous to the point of
absurdity."
He discharged the last words with such a shower of saliva that it was as if
my face had been exposed to one of those "atomizers"—not of ersatz
production—invented by the Germans to spray material with aniline dyes.
This was more than I could endure, and without changing my squatting
position, I flung myself at him head first, hitting him full force in the pit of
the stomach, which instantly laid him out flat and made him, as is said, "lose
consciousness."
I do not know or wish to know what results will be formed in your
mentation on learning about the strange convergence of life circumstances I
will now describe, but for my mentation, this coincidence provided material
for reinforcing my belief that all the events that occurred in my youth, far
from being simply the results of chance, were created intentionally by certain
extraneous forces.
The point is that this dexterity had been taught me very thoroughly only a
few days before this event by a Greek priest from Turkey, who, persecuted by
the Turks for his political convictions, had been compelled to flee from there,
and on arriving in our town had been engaged by my parents to teach me the
modern Greek language.
I do not know on what he based his political convictions



and ideas, but I remember very well that in all our conversations, even when
he was explaining the difference between ancient and modern Greek
exclamations, it was apparent that this Greek priest was always dreaming of
getting to the island of Crete as soon as possible, and manifesting himself
there as befits a true patriot.
Well then, on beholding the effect of my skill, I was, I must confess,
extremely frightened, because knowing nothing about such a reaction to a
blow in that place, I was quite sure I had killed him.
While I was experiencing this fear, another boy, a cousin of the one who
had become the first victim of my so to say "skill in self-defense," seeing
what I had done and obviously overcome by a feeling called "consanguinity,"
without a moment's pause leaped at me and with a wide swing punched me in
the jaw.
From this blow I "saw stars," as is said, and at the same time my mouth
felt as full as if it had been stuffed with enough food for the artificial fattening
of a thousand chickens.
After a little while, when both these strange sensations had calmed down
within me, I discovered that there actually was some foreign substance in my
mouth, and when I pulled it out with my fingers, it turned out to be nothing
less than a tooth of large dimensions and strange form.
Seeing me staring at this extraordinary tooth, all the boys swarmed around
me, and also began staring at it with great curiosity and in deep silence.
By this time the boy who had been laid out flat recovered and, picking
himself up, also began to stare at my tooth with the other boys, just as if
nothing had happened to him.
This strange tooth had seven prongs, and at the end of each of them a drop
of blood stood out in relief, and through each separate drop there shone
clearly and distinctly one of the seven aspects of the manifestation of the
white ray.



After this silence, rare among us young rascals, the usual hubbub broke out
again, and in noisy chorus we decided to go at once to the barber, a specialist
in extracting teeth, and to ask him why this tooth was like that.
So we all clambered down from the roof and went off to the barber's And
I, as the "hero of the day," stalked at the head of them all.
The barber, after a casual glance, said it was simply a "wisdom tooth" and
that all members of the male sex have one like it—that is, all those who up to
the time when they can say "papa" and "mama" are fed exclusively on their
own mother's milk, and who are able at first sight to pick out from many
others the face of their own father.
From all the effects of this event in which my poor "wisdom tooth"
became a complete sacrifice, not only did my consciousness begin, from that
time onward, to absorb on every occasion the very essence of the essence of
my deceased grandmother's behest—may she attain the Kingdom of
Heaven—but also, because I did not go to a "qualified dentist" to have the
socket of my former tooth treated, which as a matter of fact I could not do
since we lived too far from any contemporary center of culture, a "something"
began to ooze chronically from this socket, which had the property—as was
only recently explained to me by a famous meteorologist with whom I
chanced to become bosom friends during frequent meetings in the all-night
restaurants of Montmartre—of arousing an interest in and a tendency to seek
out the causes of every suspicious "actual fact", and this property, not
transmitted by heredity to my common presence, gradually and automatically
led to my becoming a specialist in the investigation of every "suspicious phe
nomenon" that, as so often happened, came my way.
And when, of course with the cooperation of our All-Common Master, the
Merciless Heropass, that is, the "flow of time," I was transformed into the
young man I have



already described, this new property became a real inextinguishable hearth, always burning, of consciousness.
The second vivifying factor I mentioned, which brought about the complete
fusion of my dear grandmother's injunction with all the data making up my
individuality, was the totality of impressions received from information I
chanced to acquire concerning the origin here on Earth of a principle, which
later became—as was demonstrated by Mr. Allan Kardec during an
"absolutely secret" spiritualistic séance—one of the chief "life principles"
among beings arising and existing on all the other planets of our Great
Universe.
This all-universal principle of living is formulated in the following words:
"If you go on a spree, then go the whole hog, including the postage."
As this now-universal principle arose on the same planet as you and where,
moreover, you spend most of your time lolling about on a bed of roses and
frequently dance the fox trot, I consider that I have no right to withhold from
you the information I have that will help you understand certain details of the
origin of that universal principle.
Soon after the inculcation in my nature of the new inherency I mentioned,
that is, the unaccountable striving to learn the real causes of all sorts of "actual
facts," I arrived for the first time in the heart of Russia, in the city of Moscow,
where, finding nothing else for the satisfaction of my psychic needs, I
occupied myself with investigating Russian legends and sayings. And one
day—whether accidentally or as a result of some objective lawful chain of
circumstances, I do not know—I came across the following story.
Once upon a time a certain Russian, who to all appearances was just a simple merchant, had to go on some business or other from his provincial town to this second capital of his



country, the city of Moscow, and his son—his favorite one, because he resembled only his mother—asked him to bring back a certain book. When the great, unconscious author of this all-universal principle of living
arrived in Moscow, he and a friend of his, as was and still is the custom there,
got "blind drunk" on genuine Russian vodka.
And when these two members of one of the large contemporary groupings of biped breathing creatures had drunk the proper number of glasses of this "Russian blessing," and were launched on a discussion about what is called "public education"—a topic with which it has long been customary to begin a conversation—our merchant suddenly remembered by association his dear son's request, and decided to set off at once with his friend to a bookshop to buy the book. In the shop, after looking through the book that the salesman had handed him, the merchant asked its price.
The salesman replied that the book cost sixty kopecks. Noticing that the price marked on the cover of the book was only forty-five
kopecks, our merchant first began to ponder in an unusual way—especially
unusual for Russians—and then, with a certain movement of his shoulders, he
straightened himself up like a ramrod and, throwing out his chest like an
officer of the guards, said after a little pause, very quietly but in a tone of great
authority:
"But it is marked here forty-five kopecks. Why do you ask sixty?" Thereupon the salesman, putting on the "oleaginous" face proper to all salesmen, replied that indeed the book cost only forty-five kopecks, but had to be sold for sixty because fifteen kopecks were added for postage. At this reply our Russian merchant was greatly perplexed by these two quite contradictory but obviously reconcilable facts, and something visibly began to proceed in him, and gazing up at the ceiling he again began to ponder, this time



like an English professor who has just invented a capsule for castor oil, then,
suddenly turning to his friend, he delivered himself for the first time on Earth
of the verbal formulation which, expressing in its essence an indubitable
objective truth, has since assumed the character of a proverb.
And he put it to his friend as follows: "Never mind, old fellow, we'll take the book. Anyhow we're on a spree
today, and 'if you go on a spree, then go the whole hog, including the postage.' "
As for me, unfortunately doomed while still living to experience the delights
of Hell, as soon as I had become aware of all this, something very strange that
I have never experienced before or since began to proceed in me and
continued for rather a long time, it was as if all the usual associations and
experiences from various sources were, as contemporary Hivintzes would say,
"running races" inside me.
At the same time, in the whole region of my spine there began an intense,
almost unbearable itching and in the very center of my solar plexus an equally
unbearable colic, and after a while these two mutually stimulating sensations
gave way suddenly to a peaceful inner state such as I experienced in later life
only once, when the ceremony of the "great initiation" into the brotherhood of
the "makers of butter from air" was performed over me And later, when my
"I," that is, this "something unknown" which in ancient times a certain
eccentric—called by those around him a "learned man," as we still call such
persons—defined as a "relatively mobile arising, depending on the quality of
functioning of thought, feeling, and organic automatism," and which another
renowned scholar of antiquity, the Arabian Mal el-Lel, defined as "the
compound result of consciousness, the subconscious, and instinct"—a
definition, by the way, which was later "borrowed" and repeated in a different
form by the no less renowned and learned Greek, Xenophon



when this same "I" turned its dazed attention within, I first constated very
clearly that everything, even down to each single word of this saying,
recognized as an "all-universal life principle," was transformed in me into a
special cosmic substance which, merging with the data crystallized long
before from my deceased grandmother's behest, was converted into a
"something" which, flowing everywhere through my whole presence, settled
forever in each atom composing it There and then my ill-fated "I" felt
distinctly and, with an impulse of submission, became aware of the for me
sad fact that, from that moment on, always and in everything, without
exception, I would willy-nilly have to manifest myself according to this
inherency formed in me, not in accordance with the laws of heredity or even
under the influence of surrounding conditions, but arising in my common
presence from the action of three external, accidental causes having nothing
in common first, from the injunction of a person who had become, without
the slightest desire on my part, the passive cause of the cause of my arising,
second, because a tooth of mine was knocked out by some ragamuffin,
chiefly on account of somebody else's "slobbering", and third, thanks to the
verbal formulation delivered in a drunken state by a person totally unknown
to me—a certain "Russian merchant."
If before my acquaintance with this "all-universal principle of living" I had
manifested myself differently from other biped animals like myself, arising
and vegetating on the same planet, I did so automatically and sometimes only
half-consciously, but after this event I began to do so consciously and,
moreover, with an instinctive sensation of the two blended impulses of self
satisfaction and self-awareness, in correctly and honorably fulfilling my duty
to Great Nature.
It must be emphasized that although even before this event I did
everything not as others did, my manifestations scarcely attracted the
attention of those around me but, from the



moment when the essence of this principle of living was assimilated in my
nature, then on the one hand all my manifestations, whether directed toward
an aim or merely to "pass the time," acquired vivifyingness, and began to
assist the formation of "corns" on the organs of perception of every creature
similar to me, without exception, who turned his attention directly or
indirectly toward my actions, and on the other hand I began to carry out all
these actions in accordance with the injunction of my deceased grandmother
to the utmost possible limits, moreover, the practice was automatically
acquired in me when beginning anything new and also at any change, of
course on a large scale, always to utter, silently or aloud:
"If you go on a spree, then go the whole hog, including the postage."
In the present case, for example, since owing to causes not dependent on me
but flowing from the strange and accidental circumstances of my life I happen
to be writing books, I am compelled to do this also in keeping with that same
principle, which has gradually been fixed in me by various extraordinary
coincidences created by life itself, and has blended with each atom of my
common presence.
This time I shall put this psycho-organic principle of mine into practice by
not following the custom of all writers, established from the remote past down
to the present, of taking as the theme of their various writings the events that
supposedly have occurred or are now occurring on Earth, but instead I shall
take events on the scale of the whole Universe Thus also in the present case,
"If you take, then take!"—that is to say, "If you go on a spree, then go the
whole hog, including the postage."
Any writer can write on the scale of the Earth, but I am not any writer



Can I confine myself merely to this "paltry Earth" of ours—paltry, that is,
in the objective sense?
No, this I cannot do I cannot take for my writings the same themes that
other writers generally take, if only because what our learned spiritualists
affirm might suddenly come true and my grandmother might hear of this, and
do you realize what might happen to her, to my dear beloved grandmother?
Would she not turn in her grave, as they say? And not only once, but—as I
understand her, especially now that I have become quite skillful at entering
into the position of another—she would turn so many times that she might al
most be transformed into an "Irish weathercock."
Please, reader, do not be alarmed I shall, of course, also write of the Earth,
but with such an impartial attitude that this comparatively small planet and
everything on it will correspond to the place it occupies in reality, and which,
even according to your own sane logic—arrived at thanks, of course, to my
guidance—it must occupy in our Great Universe.
And of course I must make the various what are called "heroes" of my
writings not such types as in general the writers of all ranks and in all epochs
on Earth have described and extolled, that is, types such as those Toms,
Dicks, or Harrys who are born through a misunderstanding and, during the
process of their formation up to "responsible life" fail to acquire anything
proper to a creature in the image of God—that is to say, a man—and who,
until their last breath, progressively cultivate in themselves only such
"charms" as "lasciviousness," "mawkishness," "amorousness," "malice,"
"chicken-heartedness," "envy," and similar vices unworthy of a man.
I intend to introduce in my writings heroes of such a kind that everybody
must willy-nilly sense them with his whole being as real, and about whom
data must inevitably be crys



tallized in every reader for the notion that each one of them is indeed a
"somebody" and not just "anybody."
During these last weeks, while lying in bed, my body completely
exhausted, I mentally drafted a summary of my future writings and thought
out the form and sequence of their exposition; and I decided to make the chief
hero of the first series of my writings ... do you know whom? . . . the great
Beelzebub himself. And I did this in spite of the fact that, from the very
outset, this choice of mine might evoke in the mentation of most of my
readers such associations as would engender in them all kinds of automatic
contradictory impulses coming from the data infallibly formed in the psyche
of people by all the established abnormal conditions of their external
existence, and in general "crystallized" in them thanks to the famous
"religious morality" rooted in their life—all of which must inevitably result in
an inexplicable hostility toward me personally.
But do you know what, reader? In the event that you decide, despite this warning, to risk further
acquaintance with my writings, and you try to absorb them always in a spirit
of impartiality and try to understand the very essence of the questions I intend
to elucidate, I now wish—in view of an inherency in the human psyche
whereby the good can be perceived without opposition only when a "contact
of mutual frankness and confidence" is established—to make a sincere
confession to you about the associations that arose in me and precipitated in
the corresponding sphere of my consciousness the data that prompted the
whole of my individuality to select as the chief hero of my writings just such
an individual as is presented before your inner eyes by this same Mr.
Beelzebub.
I did this not without cunning. My cunning lies simply in the logical
supposition that if I pay him this attention he



will infallibly—as up till now I have no reason to doubt— show his gratitude
by helping me in my intended writings with all the means at his command.
Although Mr Beelzebub is, as the saying goes, of "a different clay," yet
as I learned long ago from the treatise of the famous Catholic monk, Brother
Foolon—he has a curly tail, so I—being thoroughly convinced from experi
ence that curls are never natural but can be obtained only by various
intentional manipulations—have to conclude, according to the "sane logic"
formed in my consciousness from reading books on chiromancy, that Mr
Beelzebub must also have a good share of vanity, and will therefore find it
extremely awkward not to help someone who is going to advertise his name.
It is not for nothing that our incomparable teacher, Mullah Nasr Eddin,
frequently says:
"Without greasing the palm, not only is it impossible to live tolerably
anywhere but even to breathe."
And another terrestrial sage, named Till Eulenspiegel, who also based his
wisdom on the crass stupidity of people, has expressed the same idea in the
following words:
"If you don't grease the wheels the cart won't go." Knowing these and many other sayings of popular wisdom, formed
throughout the centuries in the collective life of people, I have decided to
"grease the palm" of Mr Beelzebub, who, as everyone realizes, has means and
knowledge enough and to spare.
Hold on, old fellow! Joking, even philosophical joking, aside, it seems that
with all these digressions, you have violated one of the chief principles that
you had made the basis of the system you planned for actualizing your dreams
through this new profession the principle to remember and always take into
account the weakening of the function of



thinking in the contemporary reader, and not to fatigue him with the perception of numerous ideas over a short period of time. Moreover, when I asked one of those people who are always hanging around me, "eager to enter Paradise without fail with their boots on," to read aloud straight through everything I have written in this introductory chapter, what is called my "I"—of course, with the participation of all the data formed in my peculiar psyche during the course of my life, which have given me, among other things, an understanding of the psyche of creatures like myself but of different types—my "I" perceived and cognized with certainty that, thanks to this chapter alone, there must inevitably arise in the common presence of every reader without exception a "something" automatically engendering a marked hostility toward me personally. To tell the truth, it is not this which worries me the most at the moment, what worries me is the fact that at the end of the reading I also perceived that in the sum total of everything expounded in this chapter, my whole presence, in which the aforesaid "I" plays a very small part, manifested itself in a way quite contrary to one of the fundamental commandments of that universal teacher whom I particularly esteem, Mullah Nasr Eddin, which he expressed in the words:
"Never poke your stick into a hornets' nest." But the agitation that had pervaded the whole system animating my feelings when I realized that an animosity toward me must necessarily arise in the reader immediately quieted down when I remembered the ancient Russian proverb that states "There is no offence which with time will not blow over—time grinds every grain into flour " Since then, the agitation that arose from realizing my failure to obey the commandment of Mullah Nasr Eddin no longer troubles me in the least, nevertheless, a very strange process



has begun in both of my recently acquired "souls," taking the form of an
unusual itching, which has increased progressively until it now produces an
almost intolerable pain in the region a little below the right half of my already
over-exercised "solar plexus."
Wait! Wait! . . . This process, it seems, is also quieting down, and in the
depths of my consciousness—let us say meanwhile even of my
"subconscious"—there is beginning to arise everything required to assure me
that it will cease entirely, for I have just remembered another fragment of life
wisdom, which leads me to understand that if indeed I acted against the
advice of the highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin, I nevertheless did so
without premeditation according to the principle of that extremely
engaging—not widely known on Earth, yet unforgettable by anyone who
once met him —that precious nugget, Karapet of Tiflis.
Well, it can't be helped . . . now that my introductory chapter has turned
out to be so long, it will not matter if I spin it out a little more to tell you also
about this extremely engaging Karapet of Tiflis.
First of all I must state that twenty or twenty-five years ago the Tiflis
railway station had a "steam whistle "
It was blown every morning to wake up the railway workers and station
hands and, as the Tiflis station stood on a hill, this whistle was heard almost
all over the town, and woke up not only the railway workers but all the other
inhabitants as well.
The Tiflis local government, as I recall it, even entered into a lengthy
correspondence with the railway authorities about the disturbance of the
morning sleep of the peaceful citizens.
To release the steam into the whistle every morning was the job of this same Karapet, who was employed in the station



When he would come in the morning to the rope by which he released the
steam into the whistle, before taking hold of the rope and pulling it, he would
wave his arms in all directions, and solemnly, like a Muslim mullah from a
minaret, cry in a loud voice:
"Your mother is a —! Your father is a —! Your grandfather is more than a
—! May your eyes, ears, nose, spleen, liver, corns, . . . " et cetera In short, he
pronounced in various keys all the curses he knew, and not until he had done
so would he pull the rope.
When I heard about this Karapet and this practice of his, I went to see him
one evening after the day's work, with a small "boordook" of Kahketeenian
wine, and after performing the indispensable solemn "toasting ritual" of the
locality, I asked him, of course in a suitable form, according to the local code
of "amenities" established for mutual relationship, why he did this.
He emptied his glass at a draught and, having sung the famous Georgian
song "Drink up again, boys," obligatory when drinking, he began in a
leisurely way to answer as follows:
"Since you drink wine not as people do today, that is, merely for
appearances, but in fact honestly, this already shows me that, unlike our
engineers and technicians who plague me with questions, you wish to know
about this practice of mine not out of curiosity but from a genuine desire for
knowledge, and therefore I wish, and even consider it my duty, to confess to
you sincerely the exact reason for the inner so to say scrupulous
considerations that led me to this."
He then related the following: "Formerly I used to work in this station at night cleaning the boilers, but
when they put in the steam whistle, the stationmaster, evidently considering
my age and incapacity for the heavy work I was doing, gave me the one job of



releasing the steam into the whistle, for which I had to arrive punctually every morning and evening. "The very first week of my new service, I noticed that after performing this
duty of mine I felt vaguely ill at ease for an hour or two.
"But when this queer feeling, increasing day by day, eventually became a
definite instinctive uneasiness from which even my appetite for 'makokh'
disappeared, I began to rack my brains in order to find out the cause I thought
about it with particular intensity, for some reason or other, while going to and
coming from my work, but however hard I tried I could not make anything
clear to myself, even approximately.
"Things went on like this for almost six months, and the palms of my hands
had become calloused from the rope of the steam whistle when, quite
suddenly and accidentally, I understood why I was experiencing this
uneasiness.
"The shock that brought about a correct understanding, resulting in the
formation of an unshakable conviction, was a certain exclamation I happened
to hear in the following rather peculiar circumstances.
"One morning when I had not had enough sleep, since I spent the first half
of the night at the christening of my neighbor's ninth daughter, and the other
half reading a rare and very interesting book I had come across entitled
Dreams and Witchcraft, I was hurrying on my way to release the steam, when
I suddenly saw at a street corner a barber-surgeon I knew, employed in the
local government service, who beckoned me to stop.
"The function of this barber-surgeon friend of mine was to go through the
town at certain hours, accompanied by an assistant pushing a specially
constructed cart, and to seize all the stray dogs whose collars lacked the metal
tags issued by the local authorities on payment of the tax He then had to take
these dogs to the municipal slaughterhouse, where



they were kept for two weeks at the town's expense and fed on slaughterhouse
offal. If by the end of this period their owners had not claimed them and paid
the tax, these dogs were driven, with a certain solemnity, down a passageway
that led directly to a specially designed oven.
"Shortly afterward, from the other end of this remarkable and salutary
oven, there flowed, with a delightful gurgling sound, a certain quantity of
pellucid and ideally clean fat, to the profit of the fathers of our town, for the
manufacture of soap and also perhaps of something else, while, with a
purling sound no less delightful to the ear, there poured out a fair quantity of
useful substances for fertilizer.
"My friend, the barber-surgeon, proceeded in the following simple and
admirably skillful manner to catch the dogs.
"He had somewhere obtained an old, quite large fishing net, which he
carried on his broad shoulders, folded in a suitable manner, and during these
peculiar excursions of his through the slums of our town for the good of
humanity, when a dog 'without its passport' came within range of his all
seeing and for the whole canine species terrible eye, he, without haste and
with the softness of a panther, would steal up close to it and, seizing a
favorable moment when his victim was interested and attracted by
something, would cast his net over it and quickly entangle it. Then, pulling
up the cart to which a cage was attached, he would disentangle the dog in
such a way that it found itself imprisoned in the cage.
"When my friend the barber-surgeon beckoned me to stop, he was just
waiting for the opportune moment to throw the net over his next victim,
which at that moment was standing and wagging his tail at a bitch. My friend
was just about to cast his net when suddenly the bells of a neighboring
church rang out, calling the people to early prayer. At this unexpected sound
ringing out in the morning quiet,



the doe took fright and, springing aside, shot off down the empty street at its
full canine velocity.
"This so infuriated the barber-surgeon that his hair, even in his armpits,
stood on end and, flinging his net down on the pavement, he spat over his left
shoulder and cried out:
" 'Oh, Hell! What a time to ring!'' "As soon as this exclamation of his reached my reflecting apparatus,
numerous thoughts began to swarm in it which ultimately led, in my view, to
a correct understanding of lust why there proceeded in me the aforesaid
instinctive uneasiness.
"The moment I understood this I even felt annoyed at myself that such a
simple and clear idea had not entered my head before
"I sensed with the whole of my being that my interference in the communal
life could have no other result than the very sensation that had been
proceeding in me all this time.
"And indeed, everyone awakened from his sweet morning slumbers by the
blast of my steam whistle must doubtless curse me by everything under the
sun—just me, the cause of this infernal din—and thanks to this, there must
surely flow from all directions toward my person vibrations of all kinds of
malice.
"On that memorable morning, after performing my duties, while sitting in
my usual mood of depression in a neighboring 'dukhan' and eating 'hachi' with
garlic, I continued to ponder, and I came to the conclusion that if I should
curse beforehand all those who are outraged by my service for the benefit of
some of them, then according to the book I had read the night before,
however much all those still lying in the 'realm of idiocy'—that is, between
sleep and drowsiness—might curse me, it would have no effect on me at all
"And in fact, since I began to do this, I no longer feel that 'instinctive
uneasiness. ' "



Well now, patient reader, I must really conclude this opening chapter. It has only to be signed.
He who... Stop! Misconceived formulation! With a signature there must be no
joking. Otherwise the same thing will happen to you as happened once before
in one of the countries of Central Europe, when you were forced to pay ten
years' rent for a house you occupied for only three months, simply because
you had signed a paper obliging you to renew the lease for the house each
year.
After this and many similar life experiences, I must, in any case as regards
my own signature, be very, very careful.
Very well, then. He who in childhood was called "Tatakh"; in early youth, "Darky"; later,
the "Black Greek"; in middle age, the "Tiger of Turkestan"; and now, not just
anybody, but the genuine "Monsieur" or "Mister" Gurdjieff, or the "nephew
of Prince Mukhransky," or finally, simply a "teacher of dancing."



CHAPTER 2
Prologue. Why Beelzebub was in our solar system
IT WAS in the year 223 after the creation of the world by objective time calculation or, as would be said here on the Earth, in the year 1921 after the birth of Christ. Through the Universe flew the trans-space communication ship Karnak.
Having left the spaces of the "Assooparatsata," that is, the "Milky Way," it
was flying from the planet "Karatas" to the solar system "Pandetznokh," the
sun of which is called the "Pole Star. "
On this trans-space ship was Beelzebub with his kinsmen and close
companions.
He was on his way to the planet "Revozvradendr," to a conference in
which he had consented to take part, at the request of friends of long standing
Only the remembrance of these old friendships had induced him to accept the invitation, for he was no longer young, and so lengthy a voyage with its inevitable hardships was by no means an easy task for one of his years. A short time before this voyage Beelzebub had returned home to the planet Karatas, the place of his arising, and far from which, due to circumstances not depending on his essence, he had passed many years of his existence in conditions alien to his nature. These long years of an existence unsuited to him, with all the perceptions
and experiences foreign to his essence, had not failed to leave a noticeable
mark on his common presence.
Time itself had by now inevitably aged him, and these unaccustomed conditions of existence had brought Beelze



bub, that same Beelzebub who had had so exceptionally strong, fiery, and
splendid a youth, to a no less exceptional old age.
Long, long before, when Beelzebub was still existing at home on the planet
Karatas, he had been taken, owing to his extraordinarily resourceful
intelligence, into service on the "Sun Absolute," where our Lord Sovereign
Endlessness has the fundamental place of His dwelling, and there Beelzebub,
with a number of others like himself, had become an attendant upon His
Endlessness.
But then, owing to his youthful and still unformed Reason, as well as to his
callow and impetuous mentation with its unequally flowing associations, that
is, a mentation based on a limited understanding—which is natural for beings
who have not yet become fully responsible—Beelzebub once saw something
in the government of the world that seemed to him "illogical" and, having
found support among his comrades, unformed beings like himself, interfered
in what was none of his business.
Thanks to the force and impetuosity of Beelzebub's nature, his intervention,
supported by his comrades, soon captured all minds and brought the central
kingdom of the Megalocosmos to the brink of revolution.
Having learned of this, His Endlessness, notwithstanding His all-lovingness
and all-forgivingness, was constrained to banish Beelzebub and his comrades
to one of the remote corners of the Universe, to the solar system "Ors," whose
inhabitants call it simply "the solar system", and He assigned as the place of
their existence one of the planets of that solar system, namely the planet
"Mars," with the privilege of existing on other planets also, but only of that
solar system.
Among these exiles, besides Beelzebub's comrades, were many who had
merely sympathized with him, as well as the attendants and subordinates of
Beelzebub and his friends.



They all arrived with their entire households at this remote place and in a
short time there was formed on the planet Mars a whole colony of "three
centered beings" from various planets of the central part of our Great Universe.
This population, so foreign to that planet, accommodated itself little by
little to its new dwelling place, and to shorten the long years of exile, many of
them found some occupation or other, either on Mars or on neighboring
planets that had been almost entirely neglected because of their remoteness
from the Center and the poverty of all their formations.
As the years rolled by, many of these exiles, either on their own initiative
or in response to needs of a general character, gradually migrated from Mars
to other planets, but Beelzebub himself with his close attendants remained on
the planet Mars, where he organized his existence more or less tolerably.
One of his chief occupations was the setting up of an "observatory" on the
planet Mars for the observation of remote points of the Universe as well as of
the conditions of existence of beings on neighboring planets, and this ob
servatory of his, by the way, later became well known and even famous
everywhere in the Universe.
Although the solar system Ors had been neglected because of its remoteness
from the Center and for many other reasons, the Most Holy Cosmic
Individuals surrounding our Common Father Endlessness had sent
Messengers from time to time to the planets of this solar system, to regulate
more or less the process of existence of the three-brained beings arising there,
and to bring it into accord with the general world harmony.
And thus to one of the planets of this solar system, the planet called
"Earth," a Messenger was once sent from our Endlessness—a certain Ashiata
Shiemash And as Beelzebub had fulfilled a special task indispensable to his
mission, this



Messenger, upon his return to the Sun Absolute, earnestly besought His
Endlessness to pardon the once young and fiery but now aged Beelzebub.
In view of this request of Ashiata Shiemash, and also of the modest and
conscious existence of Beelzebub himself, our Maker Creator pardoned him
and gave him permission to return to the place of his arising.
And so it was that now, after a long absence, Beelzebub was again in the
Center of the Universe.
His influence and authority, far from having declined during his exile, had
on the contrary greatly increased, since all those around him clearly
recognized that, thanks to the long years he had spent in unaccustomed
conditions, his knowledge and experience had inevitably been broadened and
deepened.
And so, when events of great importance occurred on one of the planets of
the solar system Pandetznokh, Beelzebub's old friends decided to intrude
upon him and invite him to the conference concerning these events.
And that is why Beelzebub, with his kinsmen and attendants, was now
making the long journey on the space ship Karnak from the planet Karatas to
the planet Revozvradendr.
At the time to which our tale refers, all those aboard the big space ship
Karnak were occupied either with their duties, or simply with actualizing
what is called "active being-mentation."
Among the passengers one very handsome boy stood out; he was always near Beelzebub himself. This was Hassein, the son of Beelzebub's favorite son, Tooloof.
After his return home from exile, Beelzebub had seen his grandson Hassein
for the first time and, appreciating his



good heart—and also owing to what is called "family attraction"—had taken an instant liking to him. And as the moment happened to coincide with the time when the Reason of
young Hassein needed to be developed, Beelzebub, now having a good deal
of free time, took charge of the education of his grandson himself, and from
then on kept Hassein with him wherever he went.
For his part, Hassein so loved his grandfather that he would not stir a step
without him, and eagerly absorbed everything he said or taught.
As this narrative begins, Beelzebub, Hassein, and Ahoon, the devoted old
servant who always accompanied Beelzebub everywhere, were sitting on the
highest "kasnik," or upper deck, of the Karnak under the "kalnokranonis," a
sort of glass bell, talking among themselves while observing the boundless
space.
Beelzebub was speaking about the solar system where he had spent many
years He was describing the peculiarities of the nature of a planet called
"Venus. "
During the conversation, word was brought to Beelzebub that the captain
of the ship wished to speak with him, and Beelzebub gave his consent.



CHAPTER 3
The cause of a delay in the
falling of the Karnak
SOON AFTERWARD the captain entered and, having greeted Beelzebub with all
the ceremony appropriate to one of his rank, said:
"Your Right Reverence, allow me to ask your authoritative advice An
'inevitability' lies directly in the line of our course and will hinder our 'falling'
by the shortest route.
"The point is that if we follow our intended course, in two 'kilprenos'* our
ship will be passing through the solar system 'Vuanik.'
"But at the very place where our ship must pass, there will also pass, about
one kilpreno before, the great comet belonging to that solar system and named
'Sakoor' or, as it is sometimes called, 'the Madcap.'
"So if we keep to our proposed course, we must inevitably cross the space
through which this comet will have passed.
"And as Your Right Reverence certainly knows, this mad comet always
leaves a great deal of 'zilnotrago'† in its track, which on entering the planetary
body of a being disorganizes most of its functions until all the zilnotrago has
been volatilized.
"I thought at first," continued the captain, "of avoiding the zilnotrago by
steering the ship around this zone, but this would mean a long detour and
would greatly prolong our
* "Kilpreno" in the language of Beelzebub means a certain period of time of approximately the same
duration as what is called an "hour" on the Earth
† "Zilnotrago" is the name of a gas similar to what is called on the Earth "cyanic acid."



voyage On the other hand, to wait somewhere until the zilnotrago is dispersed would take still longer. "Faced with these alternatives, I cannot decide on my own what to do, so I
am venturing to trouble Your Right Reverence for the benefit of your wise
advice."
When the captain had finished speaking, Beelzebub thought a moment and
then answered:
"Really, I do not know how to advise you, my dear Captain . . . Ah yes, in
that solar system where I existed for a long time, there is a planet named
'Earth,' on which there arose, and still continue to arise, very strange three
centered beings And among them, on one of the continents of that planet
called 'Asia,' there arose a very wise three-brained being named Mullah Nasr
Eddin.
"For each and every peculiar situation, great and small, in the existence of
the beings there," Beelzebub continued, "this terrestrial sage, Mullah Nasr
Eddin, had an apt and pithy saying.
"As all his sayings were full of the sense of truth for the beings of that
planet, I too always used them as a guide, for the sake of having a
comfortable existence there.
"In the present situation also, my dear Captain, I wish to profit by one of
his wise sayings. In such a quandary as ours he would probably say
" 'You can't jump over your knees, and it's absurd to try to kiss your own
elbow!'
"I now say the same to you, and add there is nothing to be done. When
faced with an event arising from forces immeasurably greater than one's own,
one must submit.
"The only question is, which of the alternatives you mentioned should be
chosen—that is, to wait or add to our journey by a detour.
"You say that a detour would greatly lengthen our jour



ney, but that waiting would take still longer Well then, my dear Captain,
suppose that by making the detour we should save a little time What do you
think? Is the wear and tear on our ship's machinery worthwhile for the sake of
ending our journey a little sooner?
"If a detour would involve even the slightest damage to our ship, then in
my opinion we ought to give preference to your second suggestion, and stop
somewhere until the path is cleared of the noxious zilnotrago That would at
least spare our ship useless damage And we will try to fill the time of this
unforeseen delay with something useful for us all.
"For example, it would give me personally great pleasure to talk with you
about contemporary ships in general and our ship in particular. A great many
inventions that I still know nothing about have been made in this field during
my absence from these parts.
"In my time, for instance, these big trans-space ships were so complicated
and cumbersome that it took almost half their power to carry the materials
needed to elaborate the energy for their locomotion.
"But contemporary ships, in their simplicity and the freedom they offer for
all being-manifestations, are the very model of 'bliss-stokirno.' At times you
even forget that you are not on one of the planets So, I should very much like
to know how this marvel was brought about and how the contemporary ships
work.
"Now go, my dear Captain, and make all the arrangements for this
necessary stop. Then, when you are quite free, come back and we will pass
the time of our unavoidable delay in conversation useful for us all ."
When the captain had gone, Hassein suddenly sprang to his feet and began to
dance and clap his hands, shouting "Oh, I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad about
this!"



Beelzebub looked with affection on these joyful manifestations of his
favorite, but old Ahoon could not restrain himself and, shaking his head
reproachfully muttered half to himself that the boy was a growing "egoist. "
Hearing what Ahoon had called him, Hassein stopped in front of him and
with a mischievous glance said:
"Don't be angry with me, dear Ahoon. The reason for my joy is not egoism
but only this happy coincidence. You heard him, didn't you? My beloved
grandfather didn't only decide to make a stop but also promised the captain to
talk with him.
"And you know very well that my grandfather's talks always lead to stories
of places where he has been, and you know how wonderfully he tells his
stories, and how much new and interesting information is 'crystallized' in our
presences through these tales.
"Where is the egoism? Hasn't he, of his own free will, after weighing with
his wise Reason all the circumstances of this unforeseen event, decided to
make a stop, which evidently doesn't upset his plans too much?
"It seems to me that my dear grandfather has no reason to hurry.
Everything he needs for his rest and comfort is here on the Karnak, and here
also are many who love him and whom he loves.
"Didn't he just say that we must not oppose forces higher than our own,
adding that not only should we not oppose them but should even submit to
them and accept all their results with reverence, at the same time praising and
glorifying the marvelous and providential works of our Lord Creator?
"I'm glad, not because of the mishap, but because this unforeseen event
from Above enables us to listen once more to the tales of my dear grandfather.
Is it my fault that the circumstances have turned out to be so desirable and
happy for me?



"No, dear Ahoon, you shouldn't scold me, but should even join me in
expressing gratitude to the Source of all beneficent results."
All this time Beelzebub had been listening attentively and with a smile to the
chatter of his favorite, and when Hassein had finished, said "You are right,
dear Hassein, and for being right, even before the captain returns I shall tell
you anything you like. "
Upon hearing this, the boy at once ran and sat at Beelzebub's feet and, after
thinking a little, said:
"Dear Grandfather, you have already told me so much about the solar
system where you spent so many years that by now I could probably go on,
by my own logic, to describe in detail the nature of that peculiar corner of our
Universe.
"But I am curious to know whether three-brained beings dwell on the
planets of that solar system, and whether 'higher being-bodies' are coated in
them This is what I should like you to tell me about," said Hassein, looking
up affectionately at his grandfather.
"Yes," replied Beelzebub, "three-brained beings dwell on almost all
planets of that solar system also, and higher being-bodies can be coated in
almost all of them.
"Higher being-bodies or, as they are called on some planets of that solar
system, 'souls,' are coated in three-brained beings inhabiting all the planets
except those before reaching which the emanations of our Most Holy Sun Ab
solute, through repeated deflections, have gradually lost the fullness of their
strength and no longer contain the vivifying power needed for coating higher
being-bodies.
"Of course, my boy, on each planet of that solar system the planetary
bodies of the three-brained beings are coated and take on an exterior form
corresponding to the nature of that planet, adapting to it in every detail
"On the planet Mars, for instance, where we were exiled,



the three-brained beings are coated with a planetary body having a form
how shall I tell you?—like a 'karoona,' that is to say, they have a long broad
trunk, amply provided with fat, and a head with enormous protruding and
shining eyes. On the back of this huge planetary body of theirs are two large
wings, and on the underside two comparatively small feet with very strong
claws.
"Almost the entire strength of this huge planetary body is adapted by
nature to generate energy for their eyes and their wings
"As a result, the three-brained beings breeding on that planet can see freely
everywhere, however great the 'kldatsakhti,'* and can move about not only on
the planet but also in its atmosphere, and occasionally some of them even
manage to travel beyond its limits.
"On another planet not far from the planet Mars, owing to the intense cold
there, the three-brained beings are covered with thick soft wool The outer
form of these three-centered beings is like that of a 'toosook,' that is, it
resembles a kind of double sphere, the upper sphere serving to contain the
principal organs of the planetary body, and the lower one the organs for the
transformation of the 'first and second being-foods.'
"In the upper sphere there are three apertures opening outward; two serve for sight and the third for hearing. "The lower sphere has only two apertures: one in front for the taking in of
the first and second being-foods, and the other at the back for the elimination
of residues from the organism To the lower sphere are attached two strong
sinewy feet, and on each of these is a protuberance that serves the same
purpose as our fingers.
* "Kldatsakhti" means "darkness "



"There is still another planet in that solar system, my dear boy, quite a small
one, bearing the name 'Moon.'
"During its movement this peculiar little planet often came very near our
planet Mars and sometimes for whole kilprenos I took great pleasure in
observing, through the 'teskooano,'* in my observatory, the process of
existence of the three-brained beings who inhabit it.
"Though the beings of this planet have very frail planetary bodies, they
have an indomitable spirit, which gives them an extraordinary perseverance
and capacity for work.
"Their external form is like that of large ants, and like them they are
always bustling about, working both on and within their planet.
"The results of their ceaseless activity are already plainly visible.
"I once happened to notice that in two of our years they had 'tunneled' the
whole of their planet. They were obliged to undertake this task on account of
the abnormal 'climatic conditions' there, caused by the fact that this planet
arose unexpectedly, and therefore the regulation of its climatic harmony had
not been prearranged by the Higher Powers.
"The climate of this planet is truly 'mad,' and in its variability could give
points to the most high-strung, hysterical women existing on another planet
of that solar system, which I shall also tell you about.
"Sometimes the cold is so intense on this Moon that everything is frozen
through and through, and it becomes impossible for beings to breathe in the
open atmosphere, and then suddenly it gets so hot that you could fry an egg
in a Jiffy.
"There are only two short periods on that peculiar little planet, namely,
before and after it completes its orbit around a neighboring planet, when the
weather is so glorious that
* "Teskooano" means "telescope "



for several rotations the whole planet is in bloom, and yields the various
products for the first being-food of its inhabitants—even greatly in excess of
what they need for existence in that strange intraplanetary kingdom they have
devised, where they are sheltered from the vagaries of this mad climate and
all the inharmonious changes in the state of the atmosphere.
"Not far from that small planet is another, larger planet, which occasionally
comes quite close to Mars, and is called 'Earth. '
"The Moon is actually a fragment of this Earth, which must now
constantly maintain the Moon's existence.
"On the planet Earth also, three-brained beings are formed, and they too
contain all the data for higher being-bodies to be coated in them.
"But in 'strength of spirit' they do not begin to compare with the beings
breeding on the little planet I just mentioned The external coating of the three
brained beings of that planet Earth closely resembles our own, except that
their skin is a little slimier than ours Moreover, they have no tails, and their
heads are without horns But the worst thing about them is their feet, for they
have no hoofs It is true that for protection against external influences they
have invented what they call 'boots,' but this invention does not do them much
good.
"Aside from the imperfection of their external form, their Reason is
uniquely and utterly bizarre.
"Their 'being-Reason,' owing to many causes that I may tell you about
sometime, has gradually degenerated and at present is very, very strange, and
peculiar in the highest degree. "
Beelzebub was about to say more, but just then the captain of the ship
entered. So, promising the boy to tell him about



the beings of the planet Earth some other time, he began to talk with the
captain.
He asked the captain first to tell him who he was, how long he had been a
captain, and how he liked his work, and then to give him some information
about contemporary cosmic ships.
"Your Right Reverence," the captain began, "when I approached the age
of a responsible being, I was destined by my father for this career in the
service of our Endless Creator Starting in the lowest ranks on the trans-space
ships, I ultimately became worthy to perform the duties of captain, and for
eight years now I have been a captain on long-distance ships.
"In this latest post of mine on the Karnak I succeeded my father, who had
performed the duties of captain almost from the very beginning of world
creation and who, after his long years of blameless service to His
Endlessness, was held worthy of promotion to the post of governor of the
solar system 'Kalman.'
"In short," continued the captain, "I began my service just when Your
Right Reverence was leaving for the place of your exile I was then only a
'sweeper' on the long-distance ships of that period.
"Yes a long, long time has passed by "Everything has changed and has been changed since then only our Lord
and Sovereign remains unchanged May the blessings of 'Amenzano' be on
His Changelessness throughout eternity!
"Your Right Reverence has seen fit to remark, very justly, that the earlier
ships were most inconvenient and cumbersome.
"They were indeed very complicated and unwieldy I remember them well
myself There is a vast difference between the ships of that time and now.



"In our youth all the ships, both for intersystem and interplanetary
communication, were still run on the cosmic substance 'elekilpomagtistzen,'
which is composed of two distinct parts of the omnipresent 'Okidanokh.' And
it was to produce this substance that the earlier ships had to carry such a
quantity of materials.
"But these ships did not remain in use very long after your departure; they
were replaced by ships of the system of Saint Venoma."



CHAPTER 4
The law of falling
THE CAPTAIN continued: "This happened in the year 185 by objective time calculation.
"Saint Venoma had been taken for his merits from the planet 'Soort' to the
'Holy Planet Purgatory' where, after familiarizing himself with his new
surroundings and new duties, he devoted all his free time to his favorite work.
"This favorite work was to try to discover what new phenomena could be
obtained from various combinations of lawful phenomena already existing.
"Sometime later, in the course of his observations of cosmic laws, Saint
Venoma made a discovery which after-ward became famous, and which he
was the first to call the 'law of falling.'
"Saint Venoma formulated this cosmic law as follows: " 'Everything existing in the world "falls to the bottom." The "bottom" for
any part of the Universe is its nearest "stability," and this stability is the point
toward which all the lines of force from all directions converge.
'The centers of all the suns and planets of our Universe are precisely
such points of stability. They are the lowest points of that region of space
toward which forces from all directions of the given part of the Universe
inexorably tend, and where they concentrate. Each of these points is also a
center of gravity that enables suns and planets to maintain their proper places.'
"Saint Venoma stated further that when an object, wherever it may be, is
dropped into space, it tends to fall on one or another sun or planet, depending
on which sun or planet



this part of space belongs to—that sun or planet being for the given region the stability, or bottom.
"Starting from this, Saint Venoma, continuing his research, reasoned as
follows 'If this is so, could not this cosmic property be utilized for the
locomotion we need between the spaces in the Universe?’ And from then on
he worked along that line.
"His further saintly labors showed that, although in principle this was
possible, in fact the law of falling alone could not be employed fully to
achieve this purpose, for the simple reason that the atmospheres surrounding
most of the cosmic concentrations would hinder the direct falling of the object
dropped in space.
"Having established this, Saint Venoma turned his whole attention to
finding some means of overcoming the atmospheric resistance to ships
constructed on the principle of falling.
"And three 'looniases' later, Saint Venoma did find such a means and, as
soon as a suitable vessel had been completed under his direction, he went on
to practical trials.
"This construction had the appearance of a large chamber, the walls of
which were made of a special material somewhat like glass On every wall of
the chamber were fitted, so to say, 'shutters' made of material impervious to
the rays of the cosmic substance 'elekilpomagtistzen,' and these shutters,
although set close to the walls, could slide freely in any required direction
Within the chamber was placed a special 'battery' which generated and
supplied this substance elekilpomagtistzen.
"I was present myself, Your Right Reverence, at the first experiments in
which Saint Venoma tested the principle he had discovered.
"The whole secret lay in this when rays of elekilpo



magtistzen were made to pass through this special glass, they destroyed
everything in their path that the atmosphere of planets is usually composed of,
such as 'air,' 'gases' of all kinds, 'fog,' and so on. This part of space became
absolutely empty, without resistance to pressure, so that if even an infant
being gave this enormous structure a push, it would move as lightly as a
feather.
"On the outer side of this peculiar structure were appendages like wings,
which were set in motion by this same substance elekilpomagtistzen, and gave
the impetus to move this immense structure in the required direction.
"And so, when the results of these experiments had been approved and
blessed by the Commission of Inspection, under the presidency of the
Archangel Adossia, the construction of a big ship on these principles was
begun.
"The ship was soon ready and commissioned for service. And this type of
ship gradually displaced all the systems that had existed before. Later, Your
Right Reverence, the inconvenience of this system became more and more
apparent;
nevertheless it continued to be used exclusively on all the lines of trans-space communication.
"It cannot be gainsaid that the ships constructed on this principle were ideal in
atmosphereless spaces, and moved there with almost the speed of the
'etzikolnianakhnian' rays issuing from planets; yet when they approached
some sun or planet it became real torture for the beings directing them, as
much complicated maneuvering was necessary because of this same law of
falling.
"For as soon as a ship came into the atmospheric medium of some sun or
planet that it had to pass, it immediately began to fall toward that sun or planet
and, as I just said, great care and considerable knowledge were needed to keep
the ship from falling off its course.
"While the ships were passing near any sun or planet,



their speed often had to be reduced hundreds of times below their usual rate
"It was particularly difficult to steer them in any sphere where there was a
large aggregation of 'comets'.
"Great demands were therefore made upon the beings who had to direct
these ships, and they were prepared for their duties by beings of very high
Reason.
"But in spite of these drawbacks, the system of Saint Venoma, as I have
already said, gradually replaced all the previous ones
"The ships of this system of Saint Venoma had been in existence for
twenty-three years when it was first rumored that the Great Angel Hariton had
invented a new type of ship for intersystem and interplanetary communication."



CHAPTER 5
The system of Archangel Hariton
" SHORTLY AFTERWARD, again under the supervision of the Great Archangel Adossia, practical tests open to all were made with this new invention, which was later to become so
famous.
"The new system was unanimously acknowledged to be the best, and soon
it was adopted for service throughout the Universe, gradually superseding all
previous systems.
"At the present time this system of the Great Angel, now Archangel,
Hariton is in use everywhere. The ship on which we are now flying is based
on the same principles, and its construction is similar to that of all ships built
according to this system. It is not very complicated.
"The whole of this great invention consists of a single 'cylinder' shaped
like an ordinary barrel.
"The secret of this cylinder lies in the disposition of the materials of which its inner walls are composed. "These materials are isolated from each other by means of 'amber' and,
owing to their arrangement in a certain order, have the property of acting on
any cosmic gaseous substance entering the space they enclose—whether 'at
mosphere,' 'air,' 'ether,' or any other combination of homogeneous cosmic
elements—causing it immediately to expand within the cylinder.
"The bottom of this 'cylinder-barrel' is hermetically sealed, but the lid,
although it can also be tightly closed, is hinged in such a way that on pressure
from within it opens, and then shuts again.
"So, Your Right Reverence, if this cylinder-barrel is filled with atmosphere, air, or any other such substance, the action



of its walls causes these substances to expand to such an extent that the
interior becomes too small to hold them.
"Striving to find an outlet from this constricted interior, they naturally
press against the lid of the cylinder-barrel, which opens on its hinges and
allows these expanded substances to escape, and then immediately closes
again Since in general Nature abhors a vacuum, as soon as the expanded
gaseous substances are released, the cylinder-barrel is again filled up with
fresh substances from outside, and they in their turn undergo the same
process, and so on without end Thus the substances are always being
changed, and the lid of the cylinder-barrel alternately opens and shuts.
"Fixed to this lid is a very simple 'lever,' operated by the movement of the
lid, which sets in motion some also very simple 'cogwheels,' and these in turn
revolve fans attached to the sides and stern of the ship itself.
"Thus, Your Right Reverence, in spaces where there is no resistance,
contemporary ships like ours simply fall toward the nearest stability, but
where there are any cosmic substances that offer resistance, it is these
substances, no matter what their density, that are acted upon by the cylinder
and enable the ship to move in any desired direction.
"It is interesting to note that the denser the substance in any given part of
the Universe, the better the charging and discharging of the cylinder-barrel
proceed, and in consequence, of course, the rate of movement of the levers is
accelerated.
"Nevertheless, I repeat, a region without atmosphere, that is, a space
containing only 'world ethernokrilno,' is the best for contemporary ships as it
was for earlier ones, because it offers no resistance at all, and the law of
falling can therefore be employed to the full with no need for the work of the
cylinder.
"Furthermore, contemporary ships have the advantage



that in atmosphereless spaces they can be given an impetus in any direction,
and can fall wherever intended without the complicated manipulations
necessary in ships of the system of Saint Venoma.
"In short, Your Right Reverence, both in convenience and simplicity,
contemporary ships are beyond comparison with the earlier ones, which were
often exceedingly complicated and at the same time had none of the
possibilities of the ships we use now."



CHAPTER 6
Perpetual motion
"WAIT! WAIT!" Beelzebub interrupted "What you have just been describing
must surely be that ephemeral idea that the strange three-brained beings
breeding on the planet Earth called 'perpetual motion,' for the sake of which at
one time great numbers of them went quite 'mad' or even perished.
"It once happened on that ill-fated planet that somebody got the 'crazy
notion' into his head that he could invent a 'mechanism' that would run forever
without requiring any material from the outside.
"This notion so took everybody's fancy that most of the crackpots of that
peculiar planet began thinking about it and trying to produce this 'miracle '
How many of them had to pay for this ephemeral idea with all the material
and spiritual welfare that they had previously acquired at great cost!'
"For one reason or another, they were all quite determined to invent what
they imagined would be a 'simple matter.'
"Whenever external conditions permitted, many of them gave themselves
up to the search for this perpetual motion, without any inner data for such
work, some relying upon their 'knowledge,' others upon 'luck,' but most of
them driven by an already full-blown psychopathy.
"In short, to invent perpetual motion became the 'rage' there, and every
crank felt obliged to be interested in this question.
"I was once in a town where a large number of 'models' and all kinds of
'descriptions' of proposed mechanisms for this perpetual motion had been
collected.
"What could not be found there? What ingenious and



complicated machines did I not see? In any single one of these mechanisms there were more ideas and 'wiseacrings' than in all the laws of world-creation and world-existence. "I noticed at the time that in these innumerable models and plans of proposed mechanisms, the idea of using what is called the 'force of weight' predominated The idea was this a complicated mechanism was designed to lift a 'certain weight,' which was then supposed to fall, and by its fall to set the whole mechanism in motion, and this motion would again lift the weight, and so on without end. "The result of all this was that thousands of these unfortunates were shut
up in 'lunatic asylums,' while thousands more, lost in this dream, completely
neglected to fulfill even those being-duties that had somehow been established
there in the course of many centuries, or else fulfilled them in the worst
possible way.
"I don't know how it would all have ended if some quite demented being
with one foot already in the grave, an 'old dotard,' as they say, who had
somehow acquired a certain authority, had not proved by 'calculations' known
only to himself that it was absolutely impossible to invent 'perpetual motion. '
"Now, my dear Captain, after your explanation, I can understand very well how the cylinder invented by the Archangel Hariton works It is the very thing those unfortunates dreamed of. "Indeed it can safely be said that, given atmosphere alone, this cylinder will work perpetually and without requiring any other outside materials "And since the world cannot exist without planets and hence without atmospheres, it follows that as long as the world does exist, and in consequence atmospheres, the cylinder-barrel invented by the Great Archangel Hariton will always work.



"Now just one question occurs to me—about the materials this cylinder
barrel is made of. Could you tell me, my dear Captain, what these materials
are and how long they can last?"
To Beelzebub's question the captain replied as follows. "Although the cylinder-barrel does not last forever, it can certainly last a
very long time.
"Its principal part is made of 'amber' with 'platinum' hoops, and the inner
surfaces of the staves are composed of 'anthracite,' 'copper,' 'ivory,' and a very
strong 'mastic' unaffected by 'paischakir,' 'tainolair,' 'saliakooriap,' or even by
the radiations of cosmic concentrations. "*
"But the other parts," the captain continued, "both the exterior levers and
the cogwheels, must certainly be renewed from time to time, for though they
are made of the strongest 'metal,' long use will wear them out.
"And as for the body of the ship, its long existence can certainly not be
guaranteed."
The captain would have said more, but at that moment a sound like the
vibrations of a long minor chord from a far-off orchestra of wind instruments
resounded through the ship.
With an apology the captain rose, explaining as he did so that he must be
needed on urgent business, since everybody knew he was with His Right
Reverence, and no one would venture to trouble the ears of His Right
Reverence for anything trifling.
* "Paischakir" means "heat", "tainolair" means "cold", "saliakooriap" means "water."



CHAPTER 7
Becoming aware of genuine being-duty
WHEN THE CAPTAIN had gone, Beelzebub glanced at his grandson and, noticing his unusual state, asked with concern and a shade of anxiety: "What is the matter, my dear boy? What are you thinking about so
deeply?"
Looking up at his grandfather with eyes full of sorrow, Hassein said thoughtfully: "I don't know what is the matter with me, dear Grandfather, but your talk with the captain has brought me to some exceedingly melancholy thoughts Things I never thought of before are now a-thinking in me. "Thanks to your talk, it has gradually become clear to my consciousness that in the Universe of our Endlessness things have not always been as I now see and understand them. "Formerly I should never have allowed myself to imagine, even if the thought had come to me by association, that this ship we are flying on, for instance, has not always been just as it is now. "Only now have I come to understand clearly that everything we have and
use today, all the contemporary amenities and everything necessary for our
comfort and welfare, did not always exist, nor did they make their appearance
so easily.
"It seems that in the past certain beings must have labored hard and suffered very much for all this, and endured a great deal that perhaps they could have spared themselves They labored and suffered solely that we might have these advantages today and use them for our welfare.
"And all this, consciously or unconsciously, they did for



us—beings quite unknown and entirely indifferent to them. "And now not only do we not thank them, but we do not even know
anything about them, and take it all as a matter of course, and neither ponder
this question nor trouble ourselves in the slightest about it.
"I, for instance, have already existed so many years in the Universe, yet the
thought has never entered my head that perhaps there was a time when
everything I see and have did not exist, and that everything was not born with
me like my nose.
"And so, my dear and kind Grandfather, since your conversation with the
captain has gradually made me aware of all this with the whole of my
presence, the need has arisen in me to make clear to my Reason why I
personally have these advantages, and what obligations I am under on their
account.
"It is just because of this that there now arises in me a 'process of remorse
Having said this, Hassein bowed his head and became silent.
Looking at him affectionately, Beelzebub began to speak as follows:
"I advise you, my dear Hassein, not to put such questions to yourself yet.
Be patient. Only when you reach the corresponding period of your existence
for becoming aware of such essence-questions, and reflect actively upon
them, will you understand what you must do in return.
"At your age, you are not yet obliged to pay for your existence
"This present period of your life is not given you for paying for your
existence, but for preparing yourself for the future—for the obligations
becoming to a responsible three-brained being.
"So in the meantime, exist as you exist. Only do not forget



one thing: at your age, it is indispensable that every day when the sun rises,
while watching the reflection of its splendor, you bring about a contact
between your consciousness and the various unconscious parts of your
common presence. Trying to make this state last, think and convince the un
conscious parts—as if they were conscious—that if they hinder your general
functioning in the process of ordinary existence, then in the period of your
responsible age they will not only be unable to enjoy the good that is proper
to them, but also your whole presence, of which they are a part, will not be
capable of becoming a good servant of our Common Endless Creator, and
will thus be unable to pay honorably for your arising and existence.
"I repeat once more, dear boy, try in the meantime not to think of these
questions: at your age it is still too early to think about them.
"Everything in its proper time! "Now ask me whatever you wish, and I will tell you. As the captain has
not yet returned, he must be occupied with his duties and will not be coming
back for quite a while."



CHAPTER 8
The impudent brat Hassein, Beelzebub's
grandson, dares to call men "slugs"
HASSEIN at once sat down at Beelzebub's feet and coaxingly said:
"Tell me anything you wish, dear Grandfather. Anything you tell will be the
greatest joy for me, if only because it is you who are telling it."
"No," objected Beelzebub, "you yourself must ask what interests you most
of all. It will give me much pleasure to tell you whatever you particularly
wish to know about."
"Well then, dear, kind Grandfather, tell me something about those . . . what
are they called? . . . I've forgotten . . . Oh yes, about those 'slugs.' "
"What? About what slugs?" asked Beelzebub, not understanding the
question.
"Don't you remember, Grandfather, a little while ago, when you spoke
about the three-centered beings breeding on the various planets of that solar
system where you existed for so long, you mentioned that on one planet—I
forget what you called it—there exist three-centered beings who are on the
whole like us, but whose skin is a little slimier than ours?"
"Aha!" laughed Beelzebub. "You must be asking about those beings who
breed on the planet Earth and who call themselves 'men.' "
"Yes, Grandfather, yes Tell me about those 'men-beings' I should like to
know more about them. "
Then Beelzebub said, "I could tell you a great deal about them, for I often
visited that planet and existed among those terrestrial three-brained beings
for long periods, and even made friends with many of them.



"It would be very interesting indeed for you to learn more about them, for
they are most peculiar. They have many characteristics you would not find in
any other beings on any other planet of our Universe.
"I know them well, because the whole course of their arising, their
development, and their existence during many, many centuries—by their
time calculation—has unfolded before my eyes.
"Not only did their arising and existence take place before my eyes, but even the final formation of their planet itself. "When we first arrived in that solar system and settled on the planet Mars,
nothing existed as yet on the planet Earth, which had not even had time to
cool off entirely after its concentration.
"From the very beginning, this planet has been the cause of much concern
for our Endlessness.
"If you wish, I will begin by telling you about the events of a general cosmic character connected with this planet that led to the grave concern of our Endlessness." "Yes, dear Grandfather," said Hassein, "do tell me about that. Certainly it
will be most interesting, like everything else you tell me."



CHAPTER 9
The cause of the genesis of the Moon
AND BEELZEBUB began as follows: "After arriving on the planet Mars, where we had been directed to exist, we gradually began to settle
down. "We were still absorbed in the bustle of organizing all the external
necessities for a more or less tolerable existence in surroundings so absolutely
foreign to us, when suddenly, on one of our busiest days, the whole planet
Mars was shaken, and a little later such an asphyxiating stench arose that at
first it seemed as though everything in the Universe had been permeated with
something 'unspeakable. '
"After a considerable time, when the stench had finally gone and we came
to our senses sufficiently to make out what had happened, we understood that
the cause of this terrible phenomenon was that same planet Earth, which oc
casionally approached so near to Mars that we could observe it clearly,
sometimes even without a teskooano.
"For reasons we could not yet grasp, this planet, it transpired, had 'burst'
and two fragments broken off from it had flown into space.
"I have already told you that this solar system was then still being formed,
and did not yet fully participate in what is called the 'harmony of reciprocal
maintenance of all cosmic concentrations. '
"We learned later that in accordance with this general cosmic harmony of
reciprocal maintenance of all cosmic concentrations, a comet of vast orbit,
which still exists under the name of 'Kondoor,' also had to function in this
solar system This comet, although already 'concentrated,' was describing its
full orbit for the first time.



"As competent Sacred Individuals later explained to us in confidence, the
line of this comet's path had to cross the path of the planet Earth. And as a
result of the erroneous calculations of a certain Sacred Individual who dealt
with matters of world-creation and world-maintenance, these two
concentrations had to pass through the point of intersection of their
trajectories at the same moment. Owing to this error, the planet Earth and the
comet Kondoor collided, and collided so violently that from the shock, as I
have already told you, two large fragments broke off from the planet Earth
and flew into space.
"This shock entailed these serious consequences because this planet had
arisen so recently that its atmosphere, which might have served as a 'buffer,'
had not yet had time to be completely formed around it.
"Of course, my boy, our Endlessness was at once informed of this general
cosmic misfortune. And immediately, a full commission of angels and
archangels, specialists in the work of world-creation and world-maintenance,
under the direction of the Great Archangel Sakaki, was dispatched from the
Most Holy Sun Absolute to the solar system Ors.
"The Most High Commission came to our planet Mars, since it was the
nearest to the planet Earth, and from there began its investigations.
"The sacred members of this High Commission promptly reassured us by
saying that there was no longer any danger of catastrophe on a great cosmic
scale.
"And the Arch-Engineer Archangel Algamatant was good enough to explain to us personally that in all probability what had happened was this: " 'The broken-off fragments of the planet Earth had lost the momentum
given by the shock before reaching the limits of this planet's sphere of
influence, and hence, according to



the law of falling, they had begun to fall back toward their fundamental mass. " 'But they could not actually fall upon their fundamental mass because in
the meantime they had come under the cosmic law called the "law of catching
up," and were inevitably subject to its influence Therefore they would now
have to make regular elliptical orbits around their fundamental mass, just as
this mass itself, the planet Earth, made and still makes its orbit around its sun
Ors.
" 'And that is how it will always be, unless some new unforeseen
catastrophe on a large scale changes it in one way or another.
" 'Glory be to chance,' concluded His Pantameasurability, 'the harmonious
general system movement was not unduly disturbed by all this, and the
peaceful existence of the system Ors was soon reestablished.'
"Nevertheless, my boy, this Most High Commission, having considered all
the available facts and also all the possible consequences, came to the
conclusion that, although the fragments of the planet Earth might maintain
themselves for the time being in their existing positions, yet in view of certain
'tastartoonarian displacements' envisaged by the commission, they might
some day stray from their positions and bring about many irreparable
calamities, both for the system Ors and for neighboring solar systems.
"So, to avoid this eventuality, the Most High Commission resolved to take
certain measures.
"They decided that the best solution would be for the fundamental mass,
that is, the planet Earth, to maintain its detached fragments by constantly
sending them the sacred vibrations called 'askokin.'
"The sacred substance askokin can be formed on planets only when both
the fundamental cosmic laws operating in them, the sacred
'Heptaparaparshinokh' and the sacred 'Tria



mazikamno,' act in the 'ilnosoparnian' manner, that is to say, when these two
sacred laws in a given cosmic concentration are deflected independently, and
also manifest themselves on its surface independently—of course only within
certain limits.
"And so, my boy, since a cosmic actualization of this kind was possible only
with the sanction of His Endlessness, the Great Archangel Sakaki,
accompanied by several other sacred members of that Most High
Commission, set off immediately to beseech His Endlessness to give His
consent.
"Afterward, when these Sacred Individuals had obtained the sanction of
His Endlessness, the ilnosoparnian process was actualized on the planet Earth,
still under the direction of the Great Archangel Sakaki. And so from that time
on, on that planet, as on many others, there began to arise everything
corresponding to the 'ilnosoparno,' thanks to which the detached fragments
exist until now without constituting a threat of catastrophe on a universal
scale.
"The larger of these two fragments was named 'Loonderperzo' and the
smaller 'Anulios'; and the ordinary three-brained beings who arose and were
formed on the Earth knew them by these names. But the beings of later times
gave them different names at different periods, and more recently the larger
fragment has come to be called 'Moon,' but the name of the smaller one was
gradually forgotten. As for the beings there now, not only have they no name
at all for this smaller fragment, but they do not even suspect its existence.
"It is interesting to note that the beings of a continent on that planet called
'Atlantis,' which later disappeared, still knew of this second fragment of their
planet and also called it 'Anulios.' But the beings of the last period of
existence of that continent, in whose general presences there were already
crystallized the results of the consequences of the properties



of the organ called 'kundabuffer'—about which, it now seems, I shall have to
explain to you even in great detail— called it 'Kimespai,' which meant 'never
allowing one to sleep in peace. '
"The contemporary three-brained beings of this peculiar planet do not
know about this former fragment, chiefly because its comparatively small
size and its remoteness make it quite invisible to them, and also because no
'grandmother' ever told them that once upon a time any such little 'satellite' of
their planet had been known.
"And if one of them should by chance catch sight of it through that
excellent yet childish toy of theirs called a 'telescope,' he would pay no
attention to it, simply mistaking it for a big 'aerolite.'
"Contemporary beings will probably never see it again, since it has become
proper to their nature to see only unreality.
"Let us give them their due, during recent centuries they have indeed most
'artistically' mechanized themselves to see nothing real.
"So, my boy, in due course there began to appear on the planet Earth
'similitudes of the Whole' or, as they are also called, 'microcosmoses,' and
from these micro-cosmoses were formed 'oduristolnian' and 'polormedekhtic'
vegetation.
"Still later, these microcosmoses began to be grouped, as usually occurs,
into various forms of what are called 'tetartocosmoses' of all three-brain
systems And among them arose for the first time just those biped
tetartocosmoses whom, a little while ago, you called 'slugs. '
"Some other time I will fully explain to you why and how, during the
transition of the fundamental sacred laws into the ilnosoparnian process,
similitudes of the Whole arise on planets, and what factors contribute to the
formation of



the various 'systems of being-brains'; and I will also explain all the laws of world-creation and world-maintenance in general. "Meanwhile you should know that from the beginning, these three-brained beings who interest you, arising on the planet Earth, had the same possibilities of perfecting the functions needed to acquire being-Reason as have all other forms of tetartocosmoses throughout the whole Universe. "But later, just during the period when they were gradually beginning to be spiritualized by what is called 'being-instinct'—as also takes place on similar planets of our Great Universe—there befell that misfortune, unforeseen from Above, which was so grievous for them."



CHAPTER 10
Why "men" are not men
BEELZEBUB sighed deeply and continued his tale "After the actualizing of the
'ilnosoparnian' process on the planet Earth, one year by objective time
calculation went by.
"During this period there were gradually established the corresponding
processes of the involution and evolution of everything arising on this planet.
"And of course there gradually began to be crystallized in the three-brained
beings there the corresponding data for the acquisition of Objective Reason
"In short, on that planet also, everything was proceeding in the usual
normal order.
"And so, my boy, if the Most High Commission under the supreme
direction of the Archangel Sakaki had not gone back again in a year's time,
perhaps all the subsequent misunderstandings connected with the three
brained beings arising on that ill-fated planet would not have occurred.
"This second descent of the Most High Commission to the Earth took place
because, in spite of the measures they had taken, most of its sacred members
were not fully assured of the impossibility of undesirable surprises in the
future, and they now wished to verify on the spot the results of their earlier
measures.
"The Most High Commission decided in any event, if only to reassure
themselves, to take certain additional precautions, including one measure, the
consequences of which have not only gradually become a stupendous horror
for the three-brained beings of that ill-fated planet, but have even become, so
to say, a 'festering sore' for the whole of the Great Universe.



"You know that by this time what is called 'mechanical instinct' had gradually been engendered in them, as is normal in three-brained beings. "The sacred members of the Most High Commission then reasoned that if
this mechanical instinct in the biped three-brained beings of that planet were
to develop toward the attainment of Objective Reason, as usually occurs
everywhere among three-brained beings, it might possibly happen that they
would prematurely comprehend the reason for their presence on that planet
and would then make a good deal of trouble; it might happen that once they
understood the reason for their arising, namely, that by their existence they
should maintain the detached fragments of their planet, and became
convinced of their slavery to circumstances utterly foreign to them, they
would refuse to continue this existence of theirs and on principle destroy
themselves.
"So, my boy, in view of this, the Most High Commission decided, among
other things, to implant provisionally in the common presence of the three
brained beings there a special organ with properties that, first, would make
them perceive reality 'upside down' and, second, would cause every repeated
impression from the outside to crystallize in them data that engender factors
for evoking sensations of 'pleasure' and 'enjoyment.'
"Then, with the help of the Universal Arch-Chemist-Physicist, the Angel
Looisos, a member of this Most High Commission, they made a 'something'
grow in the three-brained beings there, in a special way at the base of their
spinal column at the root of their tail—for at that time they still had a tail,
and that part of their common presence still kept its normal aspect,
expressing the 'fullness of their being-significance'—a 'something' that
fostered the arising in them of the properties I just mentioned.



"And this 'something' they then for the first time called the 'organ
kundabuffer '
"Having made this organ grow in the presence of the three-brained beings
and having made sure that it would work, the Most High Commission of
Sacred Individuals, headed by the Archangel Sakaki, returned to the Center,
reassured and with clear conscience, while on the planet Earth, which has
taken your fancy, the action of this ingenious and astonishing invention began
to flourish from the very first day, as the wise Mullah Nasr Eddin would say,
like 'the trumpets of Jericho.'
"Now, if you wish to understand even approximately the results of the
properties of the organ devised and brought into existence by the
incomparable Angel Looisos—blessed be his name to all eternity—you must
know about the various manifestations of the three-brained beings of that
planet, not only while this 'organ kundabuffer' actually existed in their
presence but also later, after its destruction, for, although this astonishing
organ and its properties were destroyed in them, the consequences of its
properties, for many reasons, began to be crystallized in their presences "But
this I will explain to you some other time "Meanwhile it must be said that
there was still a third descent of the Most High Commission to that planet
three years later, according to objective time-calculation, but on this occasion
it was under the direction of the Most Great Arch-Seraph Sevohtartra, since
the Most Great Archangel Sakaki had by then become worthy to be the divine
Individual he now is, namely, one of the four All-Quarters Maintainers of the
whole Universe.
"During this third descent the sacred members of the Most High
Commission satisfied themselves by thorough investigation that the
precautionary measures they had taken to



maintain the existence of the detached fragments of the planet Earth were no
longer needed. And so, among other things, again with the help of the Arch
Chemist-Physicist, the Angel Looisos, they destroyed in the presence of three
brained beings there the 'organ kundabuffer' with all its astonishing properties.
"But now let us return to the tale I began. "After this unexpected interruption, when we had recovered from the
bewilderment produced by the catastrophe that had menaced that whole solar
system, we slowly resumed the settlement of our new place on the planet
Mars.
"Little by little we made ourselves familiar with the surrounding nature and
adapted ourselves to the existing conditions.
"As I have already said, many of us definitely settled down on Mars; and
others either left or prepared to leave for other planets of the same solar
system, traveling by the ship Occasion, which had been put at the disposal of
the beings of our tribe for interplanetary communication.
"As for me, I remained on the planet Mars with some of my kinsmen and attendants.
"By this time my first 'teskooano' had been set up in the observatory I had
constructed there, and I was devoting myself entirely to the organization and
development of this observatory of mine, in order to make a more detailed
study of the remote concentrations of our Great Universe and of the planets of
that solar system. Among the latter, the planet Earth particularly engaged my
attention.
"Time passed. "The process of existence on this planet was gradually established, and to all appearances was taking place just as on all other planets.
"But by close observation it could be seen that the number



of these three-brained beings was increasing Furthermore, sometimes very
strange manifestations of theirs could be observed, they did something from
time to time that was never done by three-brained beings on other planets,
that is, they would suddenly, without rhyme or reason, begin destroying one
another's existence.
"Sometimes this destruction of one another's existence was not limited to
one region but took place in several regions at once, and would last not only
for one 'dianosk,' but for many, and even for whole 'ornakras '*
"It was also noticeable at times that, owing to this horrible process of
theirs, their numbers rapidly diminished, but at other periods, when there was
a lull, their numbers noticeably increased.
"We gradually got used to this last peculiarity of theirs, telling ourselves
that obviously, for certain higher considerations, this property must have been
given to the organ kundabuffer intentionally by the Most High Commission,
because seeing the fecundity of these biped beings, we assumed that large
numbers of them would be needed to maintain the 'common-cosmic
harmonious movement.'
"Had it not been for this strange peculiarity of theirs, it would never have
entered anybody's head that there was something 'fishy' about that planet.
"During the period I am speaking of, I visited most of the planets of that solar
system, those already populated and those still unpopulated.
"Personally I liked best of all the three-centered beings dwelling on the
planet 'Saturn ' Their outer form is quite unlike ours, resembling that of the
bird-being, 'raven. '
"It is interesting to remark, by the way, that for some reason or other these
raven-beings are found not only on
* "Dianosk" means "day", "ornakra" means "month"



almost all the planets of this solar system but on most of the planets of our
Great Universe where beings of various brain systems arise and are coated
with planetary bodies of different forms.
"The verbal intercourse of these raven-beings of the planet Saturn is somewhat like our own. But their way of speaking is the most beautiful I have ever heard. "It can be compared to the music of our best singers when with all their being they sing in a minor key. "And as for the quality of their relations with each other—I don't even know how to describe it. It can be known only by existing among them and having the experience oneself. "All that can be said is that these bird-beings have hearts exactly like those of the angels nearest our Endless Maker and Creator. "They exist strictly according to the ninth commandment of our Creator: 'Consider everything belonging to another as if it were your own, and so treat it.' "Later, I must certainly tell you in more detail about those three-brained beings who arise and exist on the planet Saturn, since one of my real friends during the whole period of my exile in that solar system was a being of that planet, who had the exterior coating of a raven and whose name was Harharkh."



CHAPTER 11
A piquant trait of the peculiar psyche
of man
Now LET us return to those three-brained beings arising on the planet Earth
who have interested you most of all and whom you called 'slugs.'
"I shall begin by saying how glad I am that you happen to be a long way from
those three-centered beings you called by a name so insulting to their dignity,
and that they are not likely ever to hear of it.
"Do you know, my poor child not yet aware of yourself, what those beings,
particularly the contemporary ones, would do to you if they heard what you
had called them?
"What they would do to you if they had you in their clutches—the mere
thought of it fills me with horror!
"At the very least they would give you such a thrashing that, as our Mullah
Nasr Eddin puts it: 'You wouldn't recover your senses before the next crop of
birches.'
"In any case, I advise you, whenever you start anything new, always to
bless Fate and beseech her mercy, so that she may watch over you and keep
the beings of the planet Earth from ever suspecting that you, my beloved and
only grandson, had the temerity to call them 'slugs.'
"You must know that in the years that I observed them, both from the
planet Mars and during my sojourns among them, I studied the psyche of
these strange three-brained beings very thoroughly, so I know what they
would do to anybody who dared to give them such a nickname.
"To be sure, it was only in childish naïveté that you called them that, but
the three-brained beings of that peculiar planet, and especially the
contemporary ones, do not make such nice distinctions.



"Who called them that, why, and in what circumstances, is all one to them. They have been called by a name they consider insulting, and that's quite enough. "Discrimination in such matters, according to the understanding of most
of them, is simply 'pouring from the empty into the void.'
"Be that as it may, you were extremely rash to call the three-brained
beings breeding on the planet Earth by such an offensive name; first of all
because you have made me anxious for you, and then because you have
prepared for yourself a menace for the future.
"For, even though you are a long way off and they couldn't get at you to
punish you personally, nevertheless, if they should somehow learn, even at
twentieth hand, how you had insulted them, you may be sure that their bona
fide 'anathema' would fall upon you, and the scope of this anathema would
depend upon what chanced to be occupying them at the moment.
"Perhaps it might be worth while describing to you how the beings of the
Earth would behave if they should happen to learn in what way you had
insulted them. This could serve as a good example to elucidate the
strangeness of the psyche of these three-brained beings who interest you.
"If everything was rather dull for them just then, in the absence of any
other absurd interest, the moment they were provoked by your insult they
would immediately arrange, somewhere in a previously chosen place, with
specially selected people, dressed of course in costumes specially designed
for such occasions, what is called a 'solemn council.'
"First of all, for this solemn council of theirs they would choose what is called a 'president,' and only then would they proceed with their 'trial.' "To begin with, they would, as they say, 'pick you to pieces,' and not only you but your father, your grandfather, and so on, perhaps all the way back to Adam.



"Further, if they decide—of course, as always by a 'majority of votes'
that you are 'guilty,' they would sentence you according to a code of laws
based on former puppet plays of the same kind and collated by beings known
as 'old fossils.'
"But if they happen, again by a 'majority of votes,' to find nothing criminal
in your action, though this very seldom occurs among them, then this whole
trial of theirs, recorded in detail on paper and signed by the whole lot of them,
would be dispensed—to the wastepaper basket, you think? Not at all—to the
appropriate specialists, in this case, to what is called there the 'Holy Synod,'
where the same procedure would be repeated, but this time you would be
tried by 'important' beings.
"Only after this lengthy 'pouring from the empty into the void' would they
finally come to the main point, namely, that the accused is out of reach But it
is just here that the principal danger to your person arises For when they are
certain beyond the shadow of a doubt that they cannot get hold of you, then,
as I have already said, they will unanimously decide to do nothing more nor
less than 'anathematize' you.
"Do you know what this is and how it is done? "No? Then listen and shudder. "The most 'important' beings will proclaim to all the other beings that in all
their appointed establishments, called !churches,' 'chapels,' 'synagogues,'
'town halls,' and so on, special officials on special occasions, with appropriate
ceremonies, shall mentally wish you something like the following:
"That you should lose your horns, that your hair should turn prematurely
gray, that the food in your stomach should turn into coffin nails, that your
future wife's tongue should grow three times its length, or that whenever you



take a bite of your favorite pastry it should taste like soap, and so on and so forth in the same vein. "Now do you understand what dangers you exposed yourself to when you called those remote three-brained freaks 'slugs'?" With these words Beelzebub looked with a smile at his favorite.



CHAPTER 12
The first growl
AFTER A MOMENT'S pause, Beelzebub continued: "This story of anathema reminds me of another story, which may provide very
useful material for understanding the strangeness of the psyche of the three
brained beings of that planet which has taken your fancy. Furthermore, it may
reassure you a little and give you some hope that, even if these peculiar
terrestrial beings did learn how you had insulted them and should
anathematize you, things might not turn out so badly for you after all.
"The story I am going to tell you is about something that happened quite
recently among the three-brained beings of that planet, and which came about
as follows:
"In one of their large 'communities,' there existed quite peaceably an
ordinary being who was by profession a 'writer.'
"Here you must know that in long-past ages one could occasionally run
across beings of that profession who still invented and wrote something really
by themselves, but in later epochs, and especially in recent times, writers have
been of the kind that only copy out all sorts of ideas from many books already
in existence, and fit them together to make a 'new' book. And in general they
prefer books that have reached them from their remote ancestors.
"I must point out that the books fabricated by contemporary writers, taken
all together, are the principal factor in diluting the Reason of all the other
three-brained beings there until it has become, as the venerable Mullah Nasr
Eddin says, 'thinner than air.'
"And so, my boy, the contemporary writer I was speaking



of was just a 'writer' like all the rest of them, and was nothing particular in
himself.
"One day, after finishing one of his books, he began to wonder what to
write about next, and decided to look for some new 'idea' in the books piled
up in his 'library,' which every self-respecting writer there feels obliged to
have.
"As he was rummaging about, a book called 'The Gospels' fell into his
hands.
" 'The Gospels' is the name given there to a book written once upon a time
by a certain Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John about Jesus Christ, a Messenger
from our Endlessness to that planet.
"This book is widely circulated among the three-centered beings there
who nominally exist according to the indications of this Messenger.
"And when this 'writer' happened to come across that book, the notion
suddenly popped into his head: 'Why shouldn't I also write a gospel?'
"According to certain investigations that I had to make for quite different
needs of mine, he must then have deliberated as follows:
'Am I any worse than those ancient barbarians, Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and Johnnie?
'At least I am more cultured than they were, and I can certainly write a much better gospel for my contemporaries. 'What is more, a gospel is the very thing that is needed just now,
because the "English" and "Americans" have a great weakness for this book,
and the rate of exchange of their pounds and dollars is "not half bad" just
now.'
"No sooner said than done. "From that day forth he 'wiseacred' away at his new gospel. And from the
moment it was finished and given to the printer, there began a whole series of
unexpected events.



"At any other time, perhaps nothing would have happened and this new
'gospel' of his would simply have slipped into its niche in the libraries of the
bibliomaniacs there among the multitudes of other books expounding similar
'truths.'
"But fortunately or unfortunately for this writer, it happened that certain
'power-possessing beings' of the great community in which he existed had
just been having rotten luck at 'roulette' and 'baccarat' in various resorts
abroad, and kept on demanding what is called 'money' from the ordinary
beings of their community, whereupon, thanks to these inordinate demands,
these beings at last awakened from their usual 'torpor' and began to 'sit up.'
"Seeing this, the 'power-possessing beings' who had stayed at home
became alarmed and took appropriate measures.
"Among these measures was the total and immediate destruction of
anything new that appeared in their native land that could possibly keep the
ordinary beings of their community from falling back into their torpor.
"It was just then that this writer's 'gospel' appeared. "In the contents of this new 'gospel,' the power-possessing beings found
certain things which, in their understanding, might keep the ordinary beings
from hibernating again, and so they immediately decided to get rid of both
the writer and his 'gospel,' for by now they had become past masters at
getting rid of native 'upstarts' who did not mind their own business.
"But for certain reasons they could not treat this writer in that way This
threw them into a quandary, and they hemmed and hawed about what to do.
"Some proposed simply to shut him up in a place teeming with 'rats' and
'lice', others to send him to 'Timbuktu,' and so on and so forth, but in the end
they decided to anathematize both him and his 'gospel,' with public ceremony
and



according to all the rules, no doubt in the very same terms in which they
would have anathematized you had they learned how you had insulted them.
"And so, my boy, it was there that the strangeness of the psyche of the
contemporary three-brained beings of that peculiar planet showed itself; in
the case of this writer, when he and his 'gospel' had been publicly
anathematized, the result was, as the highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin
says, 'just roses, roses.'
"What happened was this: "When the ordinary beings of that community saw what a fuss was made
over this writer by the power-possessing beings, they became greatly
interested in him, and bought and read avidly not only this new 'gospel' of his
but also all the books he had written before.
"Whereupon, as is usual with the three-centered beings breeding on this
peculiar planet, they gradually neglected all their other interests, and talked of
nothing but this writer, some praising him to the skies while others
denounced him.
"The upshot of all this discussion and controversy was simply to increase
the number of those interested in him, not only in his own community but in
others as well.
"And this occurred because some of the power-possessing beings of that
community, their pockets bulging with money, continued to go to foreign
resorts where 'roulette' and 'baccarat' were played; and, still arguing about this
writer, little by little they infected the beings of other communities.
"In short, owing to the strangeness of their psyche, it has gradually come
about that even today, when this 'gospel' has long since been forgotten, the
name of its author is known almost everywhere as that of an excellent writer.
"Anything he ever wrote is seized upon and regarded as indisputable truth.



"Everybody now regards his writings with the same veneration as was felt
by ancient Kalkians when they listened to the prophecies of their sacred
'pythonesses.' "Here it is interesting to remark that if at the present time you were to ask
any of the beings there about this writer, he would certainly recognize his
name and speak of him as an extraordinary being.
"But if you went on to ask what he had written, it would turn out that most
of them, if of course they confessed the truth, had never read a single one of
his books.
"All the same they would talk about him and discuss him, and splutteringly
insist that he was a being with an unparalleled mind and a phenomenal
knowledge of the psyche of the beings dwelling on the planet Earth."



CHAPTER 13
Why in man's Reason fantasy may be
perceived as reality
MY DEAR and kind Grandfather, will you please explain to me, if only in a
general way, why is it that the beings on the planet Earth take the ephemeral
for the real?"
To this question of his grandson, Beelzebub replied: "On the planet Earth this particularity in the psyche of the three-brained
beings arose only during later periods; and it arose only because their
predominant part, formed in them as in all three-brained beings, gradually
allowed the other parts of their total presence to perceive every new
impression without fulfilling what is called 'being-partkdolgduty,' that is to
say, merely as such impressions are generally perceived by one or another of
their independent localizations known as 'being-centers.' Or, to put it in their
language, they believe everything anybody says, instead of believing only
what they have been able to verify by their own 'sane deliberation'—in other
words, only those convictions they have reached as a result of confronting and
evaluating the data already deposited in them, which have given rise to
different conceptions in each of their localizations of diverse nature.
"In general, a new conception is crystallized in the presences of these
strange beings only if Mr. Smith speaks of somebody or something in a
certain way; then if Mr. Brown says the same, the hearer is quite convinced
that it is just so and could not possibly be otherwise. Thanks to this partic
ularity of their psyche, most of the beings there, having heard the writer I
spoke of praised so highly, are at present quite convinced that he is a very
great psychologist, with



an incomparable knowledge of the psyche of the beings of his planet.
"As a matter of fact, when I was on that planet for the last time and, having
heard of this writer, once went to see him myself on quite another matter, I
found him, according to my understanding, just like all the other
contemporary writers there, that is, extremely limited or, as our dear Mullah
Nasr Eddin would say, 'unable to see further than his nose.' As regards any
knowledge of the real psyche of the beings of his planet in actual conditions,
he might safely be called a 'complete ignoramus.'
"I repeat, the story of this writer shows in a very characteristic way to what
extent the three-brained beings who have taken your fancy, particularly the
contemporary ones, fail to fulfill 'being-partkdolgduty,' and how there are
never crystallized in them any subjective being-convictions formed by their
own logical deliberations—as in general is proper to three-brained beings
but instead, only those convictions are crystallized that depend exclusively
upon the opinions of others.
"And it was only because they failed to fulfill 'being-partkdolgduty'
which alone enables a being to become aware of genuine reality—that they
saw in this writer some perfection or other that was not there.
"This strange trait of their psyche, that of being satisfied with whatever
Smith or Brown says without trying to know more, became rooted in them
long ago, and now they no longer make the least effort to know anything that
can be understood solely by their own active reflection.
"It must be said here that the blame for this lies neither in the organ
kundabuffer, which was implanted in their ancestors, nor in its consequences,
which were crystallized in them because of a mistake on the part of certain
Sacred Individuals, and which later began to pass by heredity from generation
to generation.



"No, they themselves are to blame for it, on account of the abnormal
conditions of external ordinary being-existence they gradually established,
and which have progressively fostered in their common presence what has
now become their 'inner evil god,' called 'self-calming.'
"But you will understand all this very well for yourself later on when I
give you, as I promised, more information about the planet that has taken your
fancy.
"In any case, I strongly advise you to be most careful in the future, when
you refer to the three-brained beings of that planet, not to offend them in any
way. Otherwise, as they say, 'With what may the Devil not joke?'—they
might hear about your insulting them and, to use another of their expressions,
'lay you by the heels.'
"There is no harm in recalling here another wise saying of our dear Mullah
Nasr Eddin:
'What on earth will happen next? A flea might swallow an elephant!'
Beelzebub was about to say something more, but at that moment a ship's
attendant entered and handed him an "etherogram" in his name.
When Beelzebub had finished listening to the contents of the "etherogram"
and the attendant had gone, Hassein turned to him and said:
"Dear Grandfather, please go on and tell me more about the three-centered
beings arising and existing on that interesting planet called 'Earth.' "
Beelzebub, looking at his grandson once again with a particular smile,
made a strange gesture with his head and continued.



CHAPTER 14
Introducing a perspective that promises
nothing very cheerful
I MUST TELL you that in the beginning the beings on that planet had the same
presence as those of all the 'keschapmartnian' three-brained beings arising on
all the corresponding planets of the whole of our Great Universe, and that
they also had the same duration of existence as all other three-brained beings
"The various changes in their presence began for the most part after the
second misfortune had occurred to this ill-fated planet, during which its chief
continent, existing under the name of 'Atlantis,' entered within the planet.
"From that time on, they created all sorts of conditions of external being
existence that caused the quality of their radiations to go steadily from bad to
worse And Great Nature was thus compelled gradually to transform their
common presence through various compromises and changes, in order to
regulate the quality of the vibrations they radiated, which were required
chiefly to preserve the being-welfare of the former fragments of their planet
"For the same reason, Great Nature gradually increased the number of
beings there to such an extent that they are now breeding on all the lands of
that planet.
"The exterior forms of their planetary bodies are all much alike, and of
course in respect of size and their other subjective characteristics, each of
them is coated—just as we are—in accordance with heredity, with the
conditions existing at the moment of conception, and with the other factors
that serve in general as causes for the arising and formation of every being.
"They also differ among themselves in the color of their



skin and in the type of hair they have, and these characteristics of their
presence are determined, as everywhere else, by the effects of that part of the
surface of their planet where they arise and are formed until they reach
responsible age;
or, as they say, become 'adult.' "As for their psyche, its fundamental traits have precisely the same
peculiarities in all of them, no matter where they arise. And among these is
that special property thanks to which only on that strange planet in the whole
of the Universe does there occur the horrible process called the 'process of the
destruction of each other's existence' or, as they call it on that ill-fated planet,
'war.'
"Besides this chief particularity of their common psyche, certain properties
in each of them, regardless of where they arise and exist, are completely
crystallized and become an integral part of their common presence, properties
that exist under the names of 'egoism,' 'self-love,' 'vanity,' 'pride,' 'conceit,'
'credulity,' 'suggestibility,' and many others no less abnormal and unbecoming
to the essence of any three-brained being whatsoever.
"Of these abnormal properties the most terrible one for them is
'suggestibility.'
"Sometime I will tell you specially about this extremely strange property
of their psyche."
Having said this, Beelzebub became thoughtful, this time for longer than
usual; then, turning again to his grandson, he said:
"I see that the three-brained beings arising and existing on the peculiar
planet called 'Earth' interest you very much and, as during our voyage on the
ship Karnak we shall have to talk about many things to while away the time, I
shall tell you all I can about them.
"To give you a clear understanding of the strangeness of their psyche it will be best if I tell you about my descents



in person to the planet Earth, in the order in which they took place, and about the events that occurred there of which I myself was a witness. "I personally visited the surface of the planet Earth six times, and each of
these visits was brought about by a different set of circumstances.
"I shall begin with my first descent."



CHAPTER 15
Beelzebub's first descent to
the planet Earth
"I DESCENDED to that planet Earth for the first time," Beelzebub began, "on account of a young being of our tribe who had the misfortune to become seriously involved with a three-brained being there, and in consequence got himself mixed up in a very stupid affair. "One day several beings of our tribe, who were also dwelling on the planet Mars, came to my house with a request. "They told me that one of their young kinsmen had emigrated to the planet Earth some 350 Martian years earlier, and that recently he had been the cause of an incident with very disagreeable consequences for all of them.
"They went on to say: 'We, his kinsmen, those of us existing on the planet Earth and here on Mars, at first intended to deal with this unpleasant situation by ourselves, with our own resources. But in spite of all our efforts and the measures we have taken, we have so far been unable to accomplish anything. 'And now, being finally convinced that we are unable to settle this unpleasant affair alone, we venture to trouble you, Your Right Reverence, and beseech you to be kind enough not to withhold your wise advice as to how to find a way out of our unhappy situation.' "They then described in detail the misfortune that had befallen them.
"From all they told me I saw that this incident was disagreeable not only for the kinsmen of this young being but



also quite possibly for all the beings of our tribe. So I could not do otherwise
than undertake at once to help them settle this difficulty of theirs.
"At first I tried to help them without leaving the planet Mars, but when I
became certain that it would be impossible to do anything effective from so
far away, I decided to descend to the planet Earth and there, on the spot, to
find some way out The very next day, taking with me everything that might
be necessary, I flew there on the ship Occasion.
"I may remind you that the Occasion was the ship on which all the beings
of our tribe were transported to that solar system and that it had been left for
our use in interplanetary communication.
"This ship was based on the planet Mars, and its supreme command had
been entrusted to me from Above.
"And so it was on this ship Occasion that I made my first descent to the
planet Earth.
"On this first visit of mine, our ship landed on the shores of that very
continent which later, during the second misfortune to this planet,
disappeared entirely from its surface This continent was called 'Atlantis,' and
was then the principal place of existence for the three-brained beings of that
planet, and likewise for most of our tribe.
"Having disembarked, I went straight from the ship Occasion to the city
named 'Samlios,' where that unfortunate young being of our tribe who was
the cause of this descent of mine had the place of his existence.
"Samlios was at that time a very big city and the capital of the largest
community on the planet Earth.
"This city was the dwelling place of the head of this large community, who
was called King Appolis It was with King Appolis that our young,
inexperienced countryman had become involved.



"And it was in Samlios that I learned all the details of the affair. "It seems that before this incident our unfortunate countryman, being on
friendly terms with the king, was often at his palace.
"And one day, while visiting the king, in the course of conversation our
young countryman made a 'wager' that was the starting point of all that
followed.
"You must remember that the community over which King Appolis
reigned, and the city of Samlios where he existed, were at that period the
greatest and richest on the Earth.
"For the upkeep of all this wealth and grandeur, King Appolis naturally
needed a great deal of what is called 'money,' and for this exacted a great deal
of labor from the ordinary beings of that community.
"Here I must remark that at the time of my first descent in person to this
planet, the organ kundabuffer no longer existed in the three-brained beings
who interest you. But in some of them various consequences of the properties
of that organ, so maleficent for them, had already begun to be crystallized.
"In the period to which my tale refers, there had been thoroughly
crystallized in a number of beings on that planet the consequence of one
property which, while the organ kundabuffer itself was still functioning in
them, had enabled them, without 'remorse of conscience,' to neglect all their
obligations, whether taken upon themselves voluntarily or imposed by a
superior. Whenever they did carry out an obligation, it was done only from
apprehension and fear of threats from outside.
"And it was just this consequence, already crystallized in certain beings of
that period, that was the cause of this whole affair.



"And so, my boy, King Appolis, who was extremely conscientious himself
about the obligations he had assumed to maintain the greatness of the
community entrusted to him, did not spare either his own labor or wealth,
while demanding the same from all his subjects.
"And since the mentioned consequence of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer had by then, as I have just said, been thoroughly crystallized in
certain of his subjects, he had to employ every possible kind of 'intimidation'
and 'threat' to extract from everyone all that was needed to maintain the
greatness of the community.
"His methods were so varied, and at the same time so reasonable, that even
those of his subjects in whom these consequences had already been
crystallized could not help respecting him, although they nicknamed him, of
course behind his back, the 'Arch-Cunning.'
"Well, my boy, the methods used by King Appolis to extract from his
subjects what was necessary for maintaining the greatness of his community
seemed to our young countryman, for some reason or other, unjust, and he
grew restive and indignant whenever he heard of some new device of the
king's for getting what was required.
"And so one day, while talking with King Appolis, our naive young
countryman could no longer contain his indignation and told the king to his
face what he thought of his 'unconscionable' conduct toward his subjects.
"The king did not fly into a temper, as usually happens on the planet Earth
when somebody pokes his nose into what is none of his business, nor did he
have him thrown out by the scruff of his neck Instead he even discussed the
whole question with him and explained the reasons for his severity.
"They talked for a long time, and the outcome of their



conversation was a 'wager,' that is, they made an agreement, and set it down on paper, and each one signed it with his blood. "Among other things, it was agreed that, from then on, the king would
employ only the measures and means indicated by our countryman to obtain
what was needed from his subjects.
"And in the event that his subjects failed to contribute all that was required of them according to custom, our countryman would be responsible; and he pledged himself to procure for King Appolis's treasury whatever was necessary for the maintenance and further expansion of the capital and the whole community.
"And so, my boy, from the very next day the king did indeed fulfill most
honorably the obligation he had assumed in the agreement, and he conducted
the government exactly as our young countryman indicated. The results of
this sort of government, however, very soon proved to be quite the opposite
of those anticipated by our simpleton.
"The subjects of that community—chiefly, of course, those in whom the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer had already been crystallized—not only stopped paying into the treasury what was required, but even began pilfering what had already been put in. "As our countryman had undertaken to furnish whatever was needed,
even signing the agreement with his blood— and you know what the
voluntary undertaking of an obligation means to one of our tribe, especially
when signed with his blood—he soon had to begin making up to the treasury
all that was lacking.
"First he put in everything he had himself, then everything he could get from his kinsmen on the planet Earth. And when they had been drained dry, he turned to his kinsmen dwelling on the planet Mars.



"But soon on the planet Mars also his sources ran dry, and still the
treasury of the city of Samlios demanded more and yet more, and there was
no end in sight.
"It was just then that all the kinsmen of this countryman of ours became
alarmed, and decided to appeal to me to help them out of their plight.
"So, my boy, when we arrived in the city of Samlios I was met by all the
beings of our tribe who had remained on that planet, both old and young.
"That same evening we called a general meeting to take counsel together
in order to find some way out of the situation.
"To this first meeting we also invited King Appolis, with whom our elder
countrymen had already had many talks with the same aim in view.
"And that evening the king, addressing himself to all, began as follows:
" 'Impartial friends! Personally, I am deeply sorry for what has happened
and for all the trouble it has brought to those assembled here; and I am
distressed in all my being that it is beyond my power to extricate you from
the difficulties ahead.
'You must know,' the king continued, 'that the machinery of government
of my community, set in motion and established for centuries, is now
radically changed. To revert to the old order is already impossible without
provoking the wrath of most of my subjects. Things have reached a point
where by myself I am not able to undo what has been done without bringing
on serious consequences, and therefore I beg you all, in the name of justice,
to give me your help.
'I bitterly reproach myself,' he added, 'in the presence of all of you,
because I am also greatly to blame for all these misfortunes.



'And I am to blame because I ought to have foreseen what would happen, for I have existed longer in these conditions than my young adversary, your kinsman, with whom I made the agreement known to you all. 'To tell the truth, it was unpardonable of me to take such a risk with a being who, though perhaps of much higher Reason than myself, is certainly less practiced than I am in affairs of this kind. " 'Once more I beg all of you, and Your Right Reverence in particular, to forgive me and help me find a way out of this sad predicament. " 'As things are now, I can only do what you will indicate.'
"After King Appolis had left, we decided to choose from among ourselves
several elderly experienced beings who, that very night, would weigh all the
data and draw up a plan of action.
"The rest of us then left, with the understanding that we would reassemble the next evening at the same place; but to this second meeting the king was not invited. "At this next meeting, one of the elders who had been selected the night before reported as follows: 'We pondered this lamentable affair the whole night through, and discussed it in all its details, and we have come to the unanimous conclusion that there is no way out but to revert to the former conditions of government. 'Further, we are all in agreement that a return to the former order would unquestionably set off a revolt among the citizens of the community, and that this revolt would certainly be followed by all those consequences that have become inevitable on Earth in such circumstances. 'And of course many of the "power-possessing beings" of this community would suffer terribly, and could even be completely destroyed; and above all it seems impossible that King Appolis could escape such a fate.



" 'We then deliberated further to find some means of diverting these
unhappy consequences, if only from the king himself.
" 'And we wished at all costs to succeed in this because at our general
meeting yesterday evening King Appolis was very frank and friendly with us,
and we should all be extremely sorry if he should have to suffer.
" 'After much deliberation, we finally concluded that the king could be
saved only if, during the expected revolt, the fury of his rebellious subjects
could be diverted from his own person to those around him, that is, the
members of his "government."
" 'But then the question arose would those near the king be willing to take
upon themselves the consequences of all this? And we came to the
categorical conclusion that they would not consent to this, for they would
surely be convinced that the king alone had been to blame, and that therefore
he should be the one to pay for it.
" 'After all this, and again unanimously, we came to the following decision
" 'To save at least King Appolis from such a disaster, we must, with his
consent, replace all the beings now holding responsible posts with beings of
our own tribe, and while this "mass psychosis" is at its climax, each of them
will have to take upon himself his share of the anticipated consequences.'
"When our representative had finished his report, after a brief exchange of
views we decided unanimously to do just as the elder beings of our tribe had
advised.
"We then sent one of our elders to put the plan before King Appolis, who
agreed to it and renewed his promise to do everything according to our
directions.
"Whereupon we resolved to delay no longer, but to begin the very next day replacing all the officials with members of our tribe.



"But after two days it turned out that there were not enough beings of our tribe dwelling on the planet Earth to replace all the officials of that community, so we at once sent the ship Occasion to bring some more of our beings from the planet Mars. "Meanwhile King Appolis, guided by two of our elder beings, began under various pretexts to replace numbers of officials with our beings, at first in the city of Samlios. "And when, several days later, our ship Occasion returned from the planet
Mars, similar replacements were made in the provinces, and soon everywhere
in that community all the responsible posts were filled by beings of our tribe.
"When all these changes had been made, King Appolis, still under the
guidance of our elders, began to restore the former code of laws for the
administration of the community.
"Almost from the first days, the restoration of the old order, as had been foreseen, began to have its effect upon the general psyche of the beings in whom the mentioned consequences of the properties of the maleficent organ kundabuffer had been thoroughly crystallized. "Discontent steadily increased until, not long after, that impulse arose among them which has become proper to the presence of the three-brained beings of that planet, and which from time to time inevitably moves them to start the process they now call 'revolution.' "During this 'revolution' they destroyed—as has also become proper to those three-brained phenomena of our Great Universe—a great deal of the wealth they had accumulated over the centuries, as well as much hard-won 'knowledge,' which was lost forever. And they likewise destroyed the existence of many of their fellow beings who had already



chanced upon the means of freeing themselves from the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer. "Here it is interesting to note one most astonishing and incomprehensible
fact, namely, that during their subsequent revolutions almost all the three
brained beings there who fall into that 'psychosis,' or at least the overwhelm
ing majority, always destroy the existence particularly of those beings similar
to themselves who happen to be more or less on the track of freeing
themselves from the crystallized consequences of the properties of that
maleficent organ kundabuffer which, unfortunately, their ancestors had
possessed.
"So, my boy, while the process of their revolution was running its course,
King Appolis retired to one of his summer palaces outside the city of Samlios.
"Nobody laid a finger on him, because our beings had prepared their
propaganda so that the whole blame should be placed not upon the king but
upon those around him, that is, the members of his government.
"Moreover, the beings who had fallen into this psychosis even 'grieved' for
their king and pitied him, saying that this miserable revolution had broken out
because their 'poor king' had been surrounded by such disloyal and ungrateful
subordinates.
"When the revolutionary psychosis had completely died down, King
Appolis returned to Samlios and, again with the help of our elder beings,
began replacing our countrymen with those of his former officials who were
still alive, or with new ones appointed from among his subjects.
"And when the king had reestablished his former policy, his subjects again
began filling the treasury with money and obeying their king's commands, and
the affairs of the realm once more settled down into the old established tempo



"As for our naive, unfortunate countryman who had been the cause of it
all, it was so painful for him that he could no longer bear to remain on the
planet that had proved so disastrous for him, and he returned with us to the
planet Mars.
"And later he even became an excellent governor there for all the beings of our tribe."



CHAPTER 16
The relativity of the concept of Time
AFTER A BRIEF silence Beelzebub continued "In order for you to have a more
exact idea of the strange psyche of those three-brained beings who have taken
your fancy and who breed on the planet Earth, and in general a better
understanding of everything about this peculiar planet, in my opinion it is
very necessary for you to have an accurate conception of how they calculate
Time, and of how the being-sensation in their presence of what is called the
'process of the flow of Time' has gradually changed and what it has become
today.
"This must be made clear to you because only then will you be able to
represent to yourself and understand the events on that planet I have already
spoken about and those I shall tell you about later.
"First of all, you must know that in calculating Time the three-brained
beings of that planet take the 'year' as the basic unit, just as we do, and they
define the duration of their year as the time it takes for their planet to make a
certain movement in relation to another cosmic concentration—that is to say,
the period during which their planet, in the process of 'falling' and 'catching
up,' describes what is called a 'krentonalnian revolution' around its sun.
"This corresponds to our reckoning of a year on the planet Karatas, based
upon the period of time between those moments when the sun 'Samos' and the
sun 'Selos' are nearest to each other.
"A hundred of these years of theirs the beings of the Earth call a 'century ' "They divide the year into twelve parts and each part they call a 'month. '



"And they determine the duration of this month by the time it takes for the larger fragment, separated from the Earth—the one they now call 'Moon'—to complete, according to the cosmic laws of falling and catching up, its full krentonalnian revolution around their planet. "It must be remarked that twelve krentonalnian revolutions of the Moon
do not correspond exactly to a single krentonalnian revolution of their planet
around its sun, and they have therefore made some compromise or other in
calculating these months of theirs, so that the total corresponds more or less
to reality.
"Further, they divide their month into thirty 'days,' as they call them.
"And a day they reckon as that span of time during which their planet
makes a complete rotation on its axis, under the action of the same cosmic
laws.
"Bear in mind, by the way, that they also use the word 'day' to mean that
'trogoautoegocratic' process we call 'kshtatsavakht,' which periodically takes
place in the atmosphere of their planet, as on all other planets where the
cosmic process called 'ilnosoparno' is actualized. And when this occurs, they
say 'it is daytime.'
"As regards the opposite process, which we call 'kldatsakhti,' they call it
'night' and say 'it is dark.'
"Thus the three-brained beings breeding on the planet Earth call their
longest unit of measure of time a 'century,' and this century consists of a
hundred 'years.' A year has twelve 'months,' a month has an average of thirty
'days.' Further, they divide their day into twenty-four 'hours,' their hour into
sixty 'minutes,' and the minute in its turn into sixty 'seconds.'
"But since you, my boy, do not yet have any idea of the exceptional peculiarities of Time, you must first be told that



genuine Objective Science defines this cosmic phenomenon
thus: " 'Time in itself does not exist, there is only the totality of the results
issuing from all the cosmic phenomena present in a given place. '
"Time in itself no being can understand by Reason or perceive by any
outer or inner being-function It cannot even be sensed by any gradation of the
instinct present in every more or less independent cosmic concentration.
"It is possible to evaluate Time only by comparing different cosmic
phenomena occurring under the same conditions and in the same place where
Time is being considered.
"It should be noted that in the Great Universe all phenomena, without
exception, wherever they arise and are manifest, are simply successive,
lawful 'fractions' of some whole phenomenon which has its prime arising on
the Most Holy Sun Absolute.
"In consequence, all cosmic phenomena, wherever they proceed, have an
'objective' significance.
"And these successive, lawful fractions are actualized in every respect,
even in the sense of their involution and evolution, according to the
fundamental cosmic law, the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh.
"Time alone has no objective significance, since it is not the result of the
fractioning of any definite cosmic phenomenon Issuing from nothing, but
always blending with everything while remaining self-sufficiently
independent, Time alone in the whole of the Universe can be named and
extolled as the 'Ideally Unique Subjective Phenomenon. '
"Thus, my boy, Time or, as it is sometimes called, the 'Heropass,' is
unique in having no source on which its origin depends, and it alone, like
"divine Love," always flows independently and blends proportionately with
all the phenomena present in all the arisings in any given place in our Great
Universe.



"Again I say, you will only be able to understand clearly everything I have
just told you when I specially explain to you, as I have already promised, all
the aspects of the two fundamental laws of world-creation and world
maintenance.
"Meanwhile, simply remember this: since Time has no source of its
arising, and its presence cannot be precisely established, as can be done for all
other phenomena in every cosmic sphere, Objective Science has, for its
examination of Time, the same 'standard unit' that is used to determine exactly
the density and quality, in the sense of the vivifyingness of their vibrations, of
all cosmic substances present in every place and in every sphere of our Great
Universe.
"And this standard unit for the evaluation of Time has always been the
moment of what is called 'sacred egokoolnatsnarnian sensation,' which
appears in the Holy Cosmic Individuals dwelling on the Most Holy Sun
Absolute whenever the vision of our Uni-Being Endlessness is directed into
space and directly touches their presence.
"This standard unit was established in Objective Science to make it
possible to define and compare with precision the different degrees of
subjective sensation of conscious Individuals as well as what are called the
'diverse tempos' of the various objective phenomena which are manifested
throughout the spheres of our Great Universe, and which engender all cosmic
arisings, both large and small.
"The chief particularity of the process of the flow of Time consists in this:
it is perceived in the same way and in the same sequence by the presences of
all cosmic formations of different scales.
"To give you at least some notion of what I have just been saying, let us
take as an example the process of the flow of Time in any drop of water in
that decanter on the table.
"Each drop of water in that decanter is, in itself, a whole



independent world—a world of 'microcosmoses ' In that little world, just as in other cosmoses, there arise and exist relatively independent, infinitesimal 'individuals' or 'beings. "For the beings of that little world, Time flows in the same sequence as that in which it is sensed by all individuals in all other cosmoses These infinitesimal beings, like the beings of cosmoses of other scales, have the experience of a definite duration for each of their perceptions and manifestations and, like other beings, sense the flow of Time by comparing the duration of phenomena around them. "Like the beings of other cosmoses, they are born, grow up, unite and separate for what are called 'sexual results', they also fall ill and suffer, and ultimately, like everything existing in which Objective Reason has not become fixed, they are as such destroyed forever. "The entire process of existence of these infinitesimal beings in their tiny world requires a proportionate duration of time, which as in other worlds ensues from all the surrounding phenomena manifested on that cosmic scale "For them also a definite length of time is required for the process of their arising and formation, as well as for the various events in the course of their existence up to their final and complete destruction. "In the whole course of existence of the beings in this drop of water certain definite and successive what are called 'periods' of the flow of Time are also required. "A definite time is needed for their joys and for their sorrows, in short, for every kind of indispensable being-experiencing, down to what are called 'runs of bad luck' and even including 'periods of thirst for self-perfection ' "I repeat, among them, too, the process of the flow of Time has its harmonious sequence, and this sequence ensues from the totality of all surrounding phenomena. "In general, the duration of the process of the flow of Time is perceived and sensed in the same way by all cosmic



individuals and by all completely formed units endowed with instinct, the only difference being due to the quality of their presence and of their state at the given moment. "However, my boy, it must be pointed out that although, for separate individuals existing in independent cosmic units, the definition of the flow of Time is not objective in the full sense of the word, their experience acquires a sense of objectivity for them, since they perceive the flow of Time according to the completeness of their own presence. "The same drop of water we have taken as an example can serve to give
you a clearer understanding of this thought of mine.
"Although, from the standpoint of universal objectivity, the period of the
process of the flow of Time in that drop of water is, for the whole of it,
entirely subjective, yet for the beings existing within the drop of water itself,
this same period of the flow of Time is perceived as objective.
"To clarify this idea, those beings called 'hypochondriacs' who exist among
the three-brained beings of the planet Earth can serve as another example.
"It often seems to these terrestrial hypochondriacs that time passes infinitely slowly or, as they would say, it 'drags phenomenally tediously.' "In exactly the same way, it may occasionally seem to some infinitesimal beings in that drop of water—assuming, of course, that there happen to be 'hypochondriacs' among them—that time drags phenomenally tediously. "But in fact, according to the sensation of the duration of Time of your
terrestrial favorites, the whole existence of these 'microcosmoses' lasts only a
few of their 'minutes,' and sometimes only a few of their 'seconds.'
"Now, my boy, so that you may understand Time and its peculiarities better, let us compare your age with the corresponding age of a being existing on the planet Earth.



"And for this comparison we must take the same standard unit of Time
that Objective Science uses for such calculations.
"Bear in mind, first of all, that Objective Science has established
according to data about which you will learn later when I have specially
explained to you the fundamental laws of world-creation and world
existence—that all normal three-brained beings, and among them of course
those arising on our planet Karatas, sense the sacred 'egokoolnatsnarnian'
action, by which they define Time, forty-nine times more slowly than it is
sensed by the Sacred Individuals dwelling on the Most Holy Sun Absolute.
"Consequently, the process of the flow of Time is forty-nine times quicker
for the three-brained beings of our Karatas than for the beings on the Sun
Absolute, and this is the speed at which it also should flow for those breeding
on the planet Earth.
"Moreover, it is calculated that, during the period of time in which the sun
Samos completes its movement of closest approach to the sun Selos—the
period considered as one 'year' on our Karatas—the planet Earth completes
389 krentonalnian revolutions around its sun Ors It follows from this that our
year, according to the conventionally objective calculation of Time, is 389
times longer than the period which your favorites consider a year.
"You will surely be interested to know that these calculations were given
to me in part by the great Arch-Engineer of the Universe, His Measurability,
the Archangel Algamatant—may he be perfected unto the Holy Anklad! He
explained them to me when, on the occasion of the first misfortune to the
planet Earth, he came to the planet Mars as one of the sacred members of the
third Most High Commission And further calculations were given me by the
captain of the trans-space ship Omnipresent, with whom I had several
friendly talks on my journey home from exile.



"Now you should note that you, as a three-brained being who arose on the
planet Karatas, are at present only a twelve-year-old boy and, with regard to
Being and Reason, exactly like a boy of twelve on the planet Earth who is
still unformed and not yet aware of himself, an age all three-brained beings
there live through in the process of growing up to the Being of a responsible
being.
"All the features of your whole psyche—your 'character,' 'temperament,'
and 'inclinations,' in short, all the particularities of your psyche that are
manifested outwardly—are exactly the same as those of an immature and still
pliant three-brained being there at the age of twelve.
"And so, from all I have just said it follows that although, according to our
calculation of Time, you are only a boy of twelve, not yet formed and not yet
aware of himself, like any boy of that age on the planet Earth, nevertheless,
according to the calculation based upon the subjective understanding of your
favorites and their being-sensations of the flow of Time, you have already
existed not twelve but all of 4, 668 years.
"Thanks to all I have said, you will have material for clarifying certain factors
that later were the cause of the gradual diminishing of the average normal
length of their existence, until it has now become, in the objective sense,
'almost nothing.'
"Strictly speaking, this gradual diminution, which has finally reduced the
average length of existence of the three-brained beings of that ill-fated planet
to 'almost nothing,' had not one but many and varied causes.
"Among these, the first and principal cause was, of course, that Nature had
to adapt herself correspondingly in order to change their presence little by
little into what it is now. As for the other causes, it must be said in all justice
that



they might never have arisen on that ill-fated planet had that first cause not occurred, from which, in my opinion, all the others followed, though of course very gradually. "You will understand all this, my boy, in the course of my further tales about these three-brained beings, for the moment I shall speak only of the first and principal cause, that is, of why and how Great Nature herself was compelled to take stock of their presence and to give it a new form. "To begin with, you should know that throughout the Universe there exist two 'kinds,' or two 'principles,' of duration of being-existence. "The first principle of being-existence, called 'fulasmtamnian,' is proper to
all three-brained beings arising on any planet of our Great Universe And the
fundamental meaning and aim of their existence is to serve as the vehicle for
the transmutation of cosmic substances necessary for the 'common-cosmic
trogoautoegocratic process.'
"The second principle of being-existence is the one to which all onebrained and two-brained beings are subject, wherever they may arise And the meaning and aim of the existence of these beings also consists in the transmutation through them of cosmic substances, which are required, in their case, not for purposes of common-cosmic character, but for that solar system alone, or even for that planet alone within which or upon which these onebrained and two-brained beings arise. "In any event, to make clearer the strangeness of the psyche of those threebrained beings who have taken your fancy, you must know that, in the beginning, after the organ kundabuffer with all its properties had been removed from their presence, the duration of their existence conformed to the 'fulasmtamnian' principle, that is to say, they were obliged to exist until there was coated in them, and completely perfected in Reason, what is called the 'kesdjan



body'—or, as they themselves later named it, the 'astral body'—which, by the way, contemporary beings know of only by hearsay. "But afterward, my boy, for reasons you will learn about in the course of my further tales, they began to exist exceedingly abnormally, that is to say, in a way quite unbecoming to three-brained beings; so that on the one hand, they ceased to emanate the vibrations required by Nature for the maintenance of the detached fragments of their planet, while on the other, impelled by the chief peculiarity of their strange psyche, they began to destroy beings of other forms on their planet, thereby gradually diminishing the number of sources required for this purpose. And in order to obtain the equilibrium of the vibrations required, both in quality and quantity, Nature herself was compelled to adapt the presence of the three-brained beings gradually to conform to the second principle, called 'itoklanotz,' that is, to actualize them in the same way as one-brained and two-brained beings.
"As regards the meaning of the principle of 'itoklanotz,' I shall also specially
explain it to you sometime.
"Meanwhile remember that although in the beginning the reasons for the
dwindling of the duration of existence of the three-brained beings of that
planet were not dependent on them, yet later the main grounds for all the sad
results were—and are even more so today—the abnormal conditions of
external ordinary being-existence established by them themselves.
"Owing to these conditions, the duration of their existence has become
shorter and shorter so that now, if one compares it with that of three-brained
beings of other planets in the whole Universe, the difference is as great as
between their own duration of existence and that of the infinitesimal beings in
the drop of water we took as an example.



"Do you understand now, my boy, that even the Most Great Heropass, that
is, Time, has been compelled to actualize an obvious absurdity in the presence
of those unfortunate three-brained beings who arise and exist on the planet
Earth?
"In any case, thanks to all I have explained to you, you will be able to put
yourself in the position and understand the although merciless yet always, and
in everything, just Heropass."
Having uttered these words, Beelzebub became silent. When he spoke again
to his grandson, it was with a deep sigh:
"Ekh . . . my dear boy! Later, when I have told you more about the three
brained beings of that ill-fated planet Earth, you will understand it all for
yourself and form your own opinion about everything.
"You will understand very well that although the primary cause of the
general chaos reigning on that ill-fated planet Earth was certain
'unforeseeingnesses' from Above on the part of various Sacred Individuals,
nevertheless the chief cause of all the evils that followed is to be found in the
abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence they themselves gradually
established, and continue to establish, down to the present time.
"In any case, my dear boy, when you learn more about these favorites of
yours, not only will you see how pitiably short the duration of the existence of
these unfortunates has become compared with the normal duration long since
established as lawful for every kind of three-centered being in our Great
Universe, but you will also understand that, for the same reasons, any normal
being-sensations whatsoever in regard to any cosmic phenomena have
gradually disappeared and are now quite absent in them.
"Although, according to the conventionally objective reckoning of Time,
the beings of that ill-fated planet had



their arising several decades ago, they have not as yet any being-sensation of
cosmic phenomena, as is proper to all three-centered beings of the whole
Universe, nor have these unfortunates even the least representation in their
Reason of the true causes of these phenomena. They do not even have an
approximately correct representation of those cosmic phenomena that
proceed around them on their own planet."



CHAPTER 17
The arch-absurd: According to the assertion of Beelzebub,
our sun neither lights nor heats
"SO, MY DEAR Hassein, in order that you may have some idea of how
completely the function called the
'instinctive sensing of reality,' proper to every three-brained being of the
whole of our Great Universe, is lacking in the presence of the three-centered
beings breeding on the planet Earth—especially in those of recent periods—it
will be enough for the moment to tell you how they understand and explain
to themselves the reasons why there occur periodically on their planet the
cosmic phenomena they call 'daylight,' 'darkness,' 'heat,' 'cold,' and so on.
"All the three-brained beings of that planet who have reached responsible
age, under the influence of the many and various wiseacrings they call
'sciences,' are without exception categorically convinced that these
phenomena arrive on their planet completely ready-made, as it were, di-rect
ly from their own sun and, as Mullah Nasr Eddin would say in such cases, 'no
more hokey-pokey about it.'
"What is most peculiar about this is that, apart from certain beings who
existed there before the second transapalnian perturbation, not a single one of
them has ever had the least doubt about this conviction of theirs.
"Although their Reason, strange as it is, does bear some resemblance to
sane logic, none of them has ever yet suspected the causes of these
phenomena, nor has anyone manifested in this regard that peculiar trait of
their common psyche, proper to the three-brained beings of that planet alone,
known as 'fantasizing.' "



Having said this, Beelzebub continued with a bitter smile: "You, for instance, have the normal presence of a three-brained being and an
'oskiano'—or, as they say on the Earth, 'education'—intentionally implanted from
outside in your presence, and founded upon a morality based solely on the
commandments and indications of the Uni-Being Himself and the Most Holy
Individuals near Him. And so, if you should chance to be among the beings of that
planet, you would be unable to contain your 'being-parkhitrogool,' or what they
call 'irrepressible inner laughter,' at their astonishment if they should suddenly
sense clearly, and understand beyond all doubt, that not only does nothing like
'light,' 'heat,' and so on come to their planet from their sun, but that this supposed
'source of heat and light' is itself almost always freezing cold, like the hairless dog
of our highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin.
"In reality, the surface of their 'source of heat,' like that of all the ordinary suns
of our Great Universe, is perhaps \ more covered with ice than the surface of what
they call the 'North Pole.'
"Surely this 'glowing hearth' would rather borrow a little 'heat' from some
other source of cosmic substances than send part of its own to any planet, least
of all to that one which, because of the splitting off of a whole side, has be
come a lopsided monstrosity, and is now a source of 'offensive shame' for that
poor system Ors.
"But you yourself, my boy, do you know how and why there are produced in
the atmosphere of certain planets during trogoautoegocratic processes the
phenomena of 'kshtatsavakht,' 'kldatsakhti,' 'tainolair,' 'paischakir,' and others,
which your favorites call 'daylight,' 'darkness,' 'heat,' 'cold,' and so on? If you
do not understand this clearly, I will tell you a little more about it.
"Although I promised to explain all the fundamental laws



of world-creation and world-existence in detail sometime later it appears
necessary, in order to help you grasp what we are speaking of and assimilate
in the right way all I have already told you, to touch now, if only briefly,
upon questions concerning these cosmic laws.
"First of all, you must know that everything in the Universe—all that was
intentionally created and all that has automatically arisen—exists and is
maintained solely on the basis of the 'common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic
process.'
"This most great common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process was
actualized by our Endless Uni-Being when there already existed the Most
Great and Most Holy Sun Absolute, on which our All-Gracious Endless
Creator had and still has the chief place of His existence.
"This system, which maintains everything that arises and exists, was
established by our Endless Creator to permit the 'exchange of substances,' or
'reciprocal feeding' of everything existing, to proceed in the Universe, so that
the merciless Heropass would no longer have its maleficent effect on the Sun
Absolute.
"This most great common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process is actualized,
always and in everything, on the basis of the two fundamental cosmic laws,
the first of which is called 'the fundamental first-order sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh,' and the second 'the fundamental first-order sacred
Triamazikamno. '
"Owing to the action of these two sacred cosmic laws, there first arise from
the substance called 'ethernokrilno,' under certain conditions, various what
are called 'crystallizations', and from these crystallizations there later arise,
also under certain conditions, various large and small, more or less
independent, definite cosmic 'formations.'
"And it is just within and upon these cosmic formations that the processes
called 'involution' and 'evolution' take place, of course also according to the
two fundamental sacred



laws; and all the results obtained from these processes in the atmospheres
and furthermore, by means of these same atmospheres—blend to assure the
actualization of this 'exchange of substances.'
'Ethernokrilno' is the primordial substance with which the whole
Universe is filled, and which is the basis for the arising and maintenance of
everything that exists.
"In regard to this. Objective Science declares that everything in the
Universe without exception is material.
"You should also know that only one cosmic crystallization, known as the
'Omnipresent Okidanokh,' although also crystallized from ethernokrilno, has
its prime arising from the three holy sources of the sacred
'Theomertmalogos,' that is, from the emanations of the Most Holy Sun
Absolute.
"Everywhere in the Universe this Omnipresent Okidanokh, or
'omnipresent active element,' takes part in the formation of all arisings, both
great and small, and is in general the principal cause of most cosmic
phenomena and, in particular, of those proceeding in the atmospheres.
"So that you may have at least some understanding of this Omnipresent
Okidanokh, let me tell you that the second fundamental cosmic law—the
sacred Triamazikamno— consists of three independent forces; that is to say,
this sacred law manifests itself everywhere and in everything in the Universe,
without exception, in three separate and independent aspects.
"And these three aspects exist in the Universe under the following names:
The first, the Holy Affirming; The second, the Holy Denying; and The third, the Holy
Reconciling.



"This is why Objective Science, among other statements about this sacred
law and its three independent forces, has the following formulation 'A law
whose consequences always become the cause of further consequences, and
which always functions by means of three independent and quite opposite
manifestations, latent within it as properties neither seen nor sensed '
"Our sacred Theomertmalogos, that is, the prime emanation of our Most
Holy Sun Absolute, is subject at its very arising to this same law, and in its
further actualizations gives results in conformity with it.
"The Omnipresent Okidanokh obtains its prime arising in space outside the
Most Holy Sun Absolute from the blending of these three independent forces
into one, and in the course of its further involutions, it is correspondingly
changed in the 'vivifyingness of its vibrations' during its passage through
what are called the 'stopinders,' or 'centers of gravity,' of the fundamental
sacred Heptaparaparshinokh.
"I repeat the Omnipresent Okidanokh, among other definite cosmic
crystallizations, unfailingly participates in all cosmic formations, both large
and small, wherever they arise in the Universe and whatever the external
surrounding conditions.
"This common-cosmic 'unique crystallization,' or 'active element,' has
several particularities proper to it alone, and it is chiefly owing to these
particularities that most cosmic phenomena occur—among others, those we
have spoken of that take place in the atmosphere of certain planets.
"While, as I said, there are several particularities of the 'omnipresent active
element,' it will be enough for our present talk if we become acquainted with
just two of them.
"The first consists in this when a new cosmic unit is being concentrated,
the 'omnipresent active element' does not blend as a whole with this new
arising, nor is it transformed



as a whole in any definite place in it—as occurs with all other cosmic
crystallizations in all these cosmic formations—but as soon as it enters as a
whole into any cosmic unit, there immediately occurs in it what is called
'djartklom,' that is, it is dispersed into the three fundamental sources from
which it arose Then these three sources, each separately, give rise to the
independent concentration of three new distinct formations within the cosmic
unit And in this way the 'omnipresent active element' actualizes, at the
beginning of every such new arising, sources for the possible manifestation of
its own sacred law of Triamazikamno.
"It must also be noted that in every cosmic formation, in order to assure
the perception and further utilization of this property of the 'omnipresent
active element' for the purpose of a corresponding actualization, these
separate sources exist and have the possibility of functioning as long as the
given cosmic unit exists.
"And only after the given cosmic unit has been completely destroyed do
these holy sources of the sacred Triamazikamno, localized in the 'omnipresent
active element' Okidanokh, reblend, to be again transformed into Okidanokh,
but now with vibrations having a new quality of vivifyingness.
"As regards the second particularity of the Omnipresent Okidanokh, also
proper to it alone, and which it is now essential to elucidate for our talk on
this subject, you will be able to understand this only if you know something
about a fundamental second-order cosmic law existing in the Universe under
the name of the sacred 'Aieioiuoa.'
"This cosmic law may be expressed thus 'Every arising, large or small,
when in direct touch with the "emanations" of the Sun Absolute itself or of
any other sun, undergoes a process called "remorse," during which each of its
parts, issuing from the results of one of the holy sources of the



sacred Triamazikamno, "revolts" as it were, and "criticizes" the former
unbecoming perceptions and the manifestations taking place at the moment
in another part of its whole—a part issuing from the results of another holy
source of the same fundamental sacred law of Triamazikamno.
"The 'omnipresent active element' Okidanokh itself is also subject to this
sacred process of Aieioiuoa, or 'remorse.'
"During this sacred process, as long as the action of the sacred
Theomertmalogos or the emanation of any ordinary sun is directly affecting
the whole of its presence, the 'active element' separates into its three
primordial parts, which then exist almost independently, but when the direct
action ceases these parts blend again to exist once more as a whole.
"Here, by the way, it will be good to tell you an interesting fact about the
strangeness of the psyche of the ordinary three-brained beings of the planet
that has taken your fancy—a fact that relates to their 'scientific speculations,'
as they call them During the long centuries of my observation and study of
their psyche, I had occasion to remark more than once that, although science
appeared among them from almost the very beginning of their arising and,
like everything else there, periodically reached a more or less high degree of
perfection, and though millions of so-called 'scientists' must have arisen
among them, not once did the thought enter the head of any one of them
with the single exception of a certain Chinese named Choon Kil Tess, about
whom I will tell you later in detail—that there is any difference whatever
between the two cosmic phenomena they call 'emanation' and 'radiation. '
"Not one of these 'sorry scientists' has ever realized that the difference
between these two cosmic processes is comparable to that which our highly
esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin once expressed in these words 'They are as
much alike



as the beard of the famous English Shakespeare and the no less famous
French armagnac.'
"To understand more about the phenomena taking place in the atmospheres
and about the 'omnipresent active element' in general, you must also know
and remember that during the periods when, owing to the action of the sacred
Aieioiuoa, the process of 'djartklom' takes place in the Okidanokh, there is
temporarily released the portion of pure— namely 'totally unblended'
ethernokrilno that unfailingly enters into all cosmic formations and serves, as
it were, to connect all the active elements of any given formation; and
afterward, when the three principal parts of Okidanokh re-blend, this portion
of pure ethernokrilno is restored.
"Now let us touch briefly on another question, that is, the relationship of the
'omnipresent active element' Okidanokh to the common presence of every
being and the cosmic results arising from this.
"It is necessary to touch on this question chiefly because it will bring out a
very striking fact, which will help you grasp the differences between the
various brain systems of beings, called the 'one-brained,' 'two-brained,' and
'three-brained' systems.
"First of all, you should know that every cosmic localization known as a
'brain' takes its form from crystallizations for whose arising the affirming
source is one or another of the corresponding holy forces of the fundamental
sacred Triamazikamno contained in the Omnipresent Okidanokh. And the
holy forces are further actualized in the presence of beings precisely through
these localizations.
"Some other time I will give you a special explanation of the process of the
arising of being-brains in the presence of beings; meanwhile, let us talk a little
about the results which the Omnipresent Okidanokh actualizes by means of
these being-brains.



"The 'omnipresent active element' Okidanokh enters the presence
of beings through the three kinds of 'being-food.'
"And it does so because, as I have already told you, Okidanokh
necessarily participates in the formation of all the products that serve
as being-food, and is therefore always present in them.
"Well, my boy, the essential peculiarity of the Omnipresent
Okidanokh is that, in this case, it undergoes the process of 'djartklom'
in the presence of beings independently of any contact with the
emanations of a large cosmic concentration;
and the factors for this process are either the results of
'partkdolgduty' consciously actualized by the beings themselves
which I will later explain to you in detail—or that process of Great
Nature existing in the Universe under the name of 'kerkoolnooarnian
actualization,' which consists in 'obtaining the required totality of
vibrations by adaptation.' This latter process takes place in beings
without any participation whatever of their consciousness.
"In both cases when Okidanokh enters the presence of a being and
undergoes the process of 'djartklom,' each of its fundamental parts
blends with those perceptions present in the being at the moment
which correspond to it according to what are called 'kindred
vibrations,' and it is then concentrated upon the corresponding
localization, that is, upon the corresponding brain. These blendings
are called 'being-impulsakri.'
"Note well, my boy, that these localizations, or brains, not only
serve as apparatuses for the transformation of corresponding cosmic
substances for the purposes of the most great common-cosmic
Trogoautoegocratic but are also the means whereby the conscious
self-perfecting of beings is possible.
"This latter aim depends upon the quality of the 'being-impulsakri'
concentrated or, as is otherwise said, deposited onto the being-brains.



"Concerning the quality of the 'being-impulsakri,' there is one special
commandment, among the direct commandments of our All-Embracing
Endlessness, which is strictly observed by all normal three-brained beings of
our Great Universe, and is expressed in the words 'Always guard against such
perceptions as may soil the purity of your brains.'
"Three-brained beings have the possibility of personal self-perfecting
because of the localization in their common presence of three centers, or three
brains, upon which, when the Omnipresent Okidanokh undergoes the process
of 'djartklom,' the three holy forces of the sacred Triamazikamno are
deposited and acquire the possibility of further, this time independent,
actualizations.
"The point is that beings having this three-brained system can, by the
conscious and intentional fulfilling of being-partkdolgduty, utilize for their
own presence the three holy forces liberated from the Omnipresent
Okidanokh by the process of 'djartklom,' and so bring their presence to what
is called the 'sakronoolantsaknian' state, that is to say, they can become
Individuals who have their own sacred law of Triamazikamno, and thereby
the possibility of consciously taking in and coating in their common presence
that 'All-Holy' which, among other things, helps to actualize the functioning
in cosmic units of objective or divine Reason.
"Nevertheless, my boy, Just here lies the great terror The three-brained
beings of the planet Earth also have, up to the time of their complete
destruction, these three independent localizations, or being-brains, through
which the three holy forces of the sacred Triamazikamno, which they might
use for their own self-perfecting, are transformed for further actualizations,
yet, because of the abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence
established by them themselves, these possibilities beat their wings in vain
"It is interesting to note that in the three-brained beings



of the planet Earth these being-brains are found in the same parts of the
planetary body as in us. That is:
"The brain predetermined by Great Nature for the concentration and further
actualizing of the first holy force of the sacred Triamazikamno, called the
'Holy Affirming,' is localized in the head.
"The second brain, which transforms and crystallizes the second holy force
of the sacred Triamazikamno, the 'Holy Denying,' is placed in them, as in us,
along the whole length of the back, in what is called the 'spinal column.'
"But as for the place of concentration and source for further manifestation
of the third holy force of the sacred Triamazikamno, namely, the 'Holy
Reconciling,' the exterior form of this being-brain in them bears no
resemblance whatever to ours.
"You must know that in the earliest three-brained beings there, this being
brain was localized in the same part of the planetary body as in us, and had
exactly the same exterior form, but for many reasons you yourself will come
to understand in the course of my talks, Great Nature was constrained to alter
this brain little by little and to give it the form it has in contemporary beings
"In your favorites of the present day this being-brain is not localized in one
whole mass, as is proper to the presence of all other three-brained beings of
our Great Universe, but is split up into parts and each of these parts,
according to its 'specific functioning,' is localized in a different place in their
planetary body.
"Although, in its exterior form, this being-center of theirs now has different
places of concentration, nevertheless all its separate functionings have
corresponding connections with one another, so that the sum total of these
scattered parts can function exactly as is proper for it to function.
"They call these separate localizations in their common presence 'nerve nodes. '



"It is interesting to note that most of these places of concentration are located in the very region of the planetary body where this being-brain would normally be, that is, in the region of the chest, and the totality of these nerve nodes they call the 'solar plexus.'
"And so, my boy, in the presence of each one of your favorites, the Omnipresent Okidanokh undergoes the process of 'djartklom,' and in them also, each of its three holy forces blends independently with other cosmic crystallizations for a corresponding actualization. But since they have entirely ceased to fulfill being-partkdolgduty, chiefly because of the abnormal conditions of being-existence gradually established by them themselves, none of these holy sources of everything existing is transubstantiated for their own presences, except the denying source alone. "The crystallizations that arise in their presence from the first and third holy forces are utilized almost entirely by the common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process, and only the crystallizations of the second part of the Omnipresent Okidanokh, the Holy Denying, serve for the coating of their own presence. Hence most of them remain with a presence consisting of the planetary body alone, and are thus, for themselves, destroyed forever. "As regards the particularities proper only to the omnipresent, everywhere penetrating, active element Okidanokh, and the further results produced by them, you will have a clear picture of all this when I have explained to you in more or less detail, as I have already promised, the fundamental laws of world-creation and world-maintenance. "In the meantime, I shall tell you about the elucidating experiments
pertaining to this omnipresent cosmic crystallization at which I was present in
person.
"However, it was not on the planet Earth that I was an



eyewitness to these experiments, nor did your favorites conduct them. They
were carried out on the planet Saturn by that three-brained being who, during
almost the whole period of my exile in that solar system, was my real friend,
about whom I recently promised to tell you in more detail."



CHAPTER 18
The arch-preposterous
BEELZEBUB continued: "My first meeting with the three-centered being who later became my
'essence-friend,' and thanks to whom I saw these experiments with the
'Omnipresent Okidanokh,' took place in the following circumstances.
"You must know that at the beginning of my exile to that solar system,
certain essence-friends of mine, who had not taken part in the events that
caused my exile, carried out in relation to me personally the sacred process
which exists in the Universe under the name of the sacred 'vznooshlitzval,'
that is to say, they implanted in the presence of certain corresponding three
centered beings, by means of another sacred process called 'askalnooazar,' the
impulse that Objective Science describes as 'trusting another as oneself.'
"Well then, soon after my arrival in the solar system Ors I began visiting
its various planets. And when I first descended to the surface of the planet
Saturn, it turned out that one of the beings who had undergone the sacred
action of 'vznooshlitzval' in regard to my person was what is called there the
'harakhrakhrookhry' of all the three-centered beings arising and existing on
that planet.
"On the planet Saturn 'harakhrakhrookhry' is the name given to the sole
chief of all the other beings on that planet.
"Such being-chiefs also exist on every other planet where three-brained
beings breed; on different planets they are differently named, and on the
Earth such a chief is called a 'king.'
"The only difference is that while everywhere else, even on the other
planets of the same system, there is only one 'king' for the whole planet, on
your peculiar planet Earth,



for each accidentally separated group of your favorites there is a separate 'king,' sometimes even several of them.
"Well . . . "When I descended to the surface of the planet Saturn, and began to
mingle with the three-centered beings there, it chanced that on the day after
my arrival I had occasion to have a meeting with the harakhrakhrookhry
himself In the course of our exchange of subjective opinions he invited me to
stay in his own 'harkhookhry,' that is, his palace, for the whole of my sojourn
on his planet.
"And this I did. "So, my boy, once while we were talking, simply according to the flow of
'associative being-mentation,' we happened to touch upon the question of the
strange results that arise from the manifestations of the particularities of the
Omnipresent Okidanokh The venerable harakhrakhrookhry of the planet
Saturn mentioned that one of his learned subjects by the name of Harharkh,
in order to study certain previously unexplained properties of that cosmic
substance, had recently devised an exceedingly interesting apparatus, the
chief demonstrating part of which he called 'hrakhartzakha.'
"And he offered to make the necessary arrangements, if I wished, to have
this new invention shown to me with full explanations.
"The result was that the following day, escorted by one of the venerable
harakhrakhrookhry's attendants, I went to the place of existence of
Gornahoor Harharkh, and there for the first time I witnessed those novel
experiments elucidating the Omnipresent Okidanokh.
"Gornahoor Harharkh, who afterward, as I have already told you, became my essence-friend, was then considered one of the foremost scientists among the ordinary three



brained beings of the whole Universe All his discoveries were widely known, as were the apparatuses he had invented for his experiments, and on various other planets other learned beings were making more and more use of them. "Here it will do no harm to remark that I owe it entirely to his knowledge that I was later able to install in my observatory on the planet Mars that 'teskooano' which enhanced the power of my sight and, as is said, increased the visibility of remote cosmic concentrations 7, 000, 285 times. "The truth is, it was thanks to this teskooano that my observatory was later regarded as one of the best installations of its kind in the whole Universe Most important of all, by means of this teskooano I was able, even while staying at home on Mars, to see and observe relatively easily the processes of existence taking place on those parts of the surface of other planets of that solar system which, in accordance with the 'common-cosmic harmonious movement,' could be perceived by 'being-sight' at the given moment.
"When Gornahoor Harharkh was told who we were and why we had come, he came to meet us and very amicably began his explanations. "Before going into this, perhaps I should warn you once and for all that my conversations with three-centered beings dwelling on the various planets of that solar system where I was obliged to exist for the 'sins of my youth'as for instance the conversation with Gornahoor Harharkh—were all held in languages still unknown to you, whose consonances were sometimes quite 'indigestible' by the normal being-functions meant for this purpose. "And so, my boy, I shall not repeat these conversations word for word, but
simply give you their meaning in our language, continuing of course to use
those 'terms' and 'specific names'—or rather those combinations of sounds
pro



duced by the being-vocal cords of your favorites on the planet Earth—which,
owing to their frequent repetition in my tales, have by now become familiar to
you and easily understood.
"Ah yes . . . it should be added here that the word 'gornahoor' is used by
the three-brained beings of the planet Saturn as a matter of courtesy, they put
it in front of the name of the one they are addressing It is the same with your
favorites on the planet Earth, who have invented the custom of putting the
word 'mister,' or sometimes a whole meaningless phrase, in front of the name
of the person they are speaking to—which expresses a notion that our hon
orable Mullah Nasr Eddin characterizes in the saying.
" 'Even so, there's more in it than in the wiseacrings of an expert in
monkey-business.'
"Well, my boy . . . "When he had been informed of what was required of him, this future
essence-friend of mine, Gornahoor Harharkh, made a sign to us to approach
that special appliance he had invented, which he called 'hrakhartzakha.'
"As we came nearer this very strange construction, he pointed to it with a
particular feather of his right wing, and said:
" 'This special appliance is the chief part of my whole invention, and it is
just in this part that the results of almost all the particularities of the
omnipresent substance Okidanokh are found and manifested. '
"Then, pointing to all the other appliances in the 'khrkh,' or 'workshop,' he
added:
'All these special appliances that I invented have enabled me to obtain
certain extremely important clarifications about the omnipresent and
everywhere-penetrating Okidanokh, because they made it possible for me first
to collect all three fundamental parts of Okidanokh from every kind of sur



planetary and intraplanetary process and then to blend them artificially into a
whole; and finally to dissociate them, also artificially, and to study the
specific properties of each part separately in its manifestations.'
"Having said this, he again pointed to the 'hrakhartzakha' and added that
by means of this experimental apparatus any ordinary being could clearly
understand in detail the properties of the three parts—entirely independent in
themselves and in their manifestations—of the 'unique active element' whose
particularities are the chief cause of everything existing in the Universe.
Furthermore, any ordinary being could become categorically convinced that
no results normally obtained from the processes through which this om
nipresent world-substance passes can ever be perceived or sensed by beings.
The only results of these processes that can be perceived by certain being
functions are those that for some reason or other occur abnormally on account
of causes coming from without, either from conscious sources or from
accidental mechanical results.
"The part of Gornahoor Harharkh's new invention called 'hrakhartzakha,'
and considered the most important, looked very much like a 'tirzikiano' or, as
your favorites would say, a huge 'electric light bulb.'
"The interior of this original structure was rather like a smallish room with
a door that could be hermetically sealed.
"The walls were made of a certain transparent material, resembling what is
called 'glass' on your planet.
"As I later learned, the chief particularity of this transparent material was
that, although with the organ of sight a being could perceive every kind of
cosmic concentration through it, it did not permit any rays, whatever their
source, to penetrate it, either from within or from without.
"As I looked at this part of that astonishing being-invention, I could
clearly distinguish through its transparent walls, in the center, what seemed to
be a table and two



chairs. Above the table hung three identical 'things' like terrestrial electric
light bulbs and resembling 'momonodooars.' On the table and standing beside
it were several different apparatuses and instruments altogether unknown
to me. "I afterward realized that all the objects contained in this 'hrakhartzakha,'
as well as everything we were to put on later, were made of special materials
invented by Gornahoor Harharkh As regards these materials, I will go into
more detail at the proper time.
"Meanwhile bear in mind that in the enormous 'khrkh,' or workshop, of
Gornahoor Harharkh, besides the 'hrakhartzakha' there were several other
large independent apparatuses, and among them two quite special 'life
chakhans,' which Gornahoor Harharkh called 'khrikhirkhis.'
"It is interesting to note that your favorites also have something like this
'life-chakhan,' or 'khrikhirkhi,' which they call a 'dynamo.'
"At one side stood another enormous appliance which turned out to be a
special kind of 'solookhnorakhoona,' or what your favorites would describe as
a 'pump of complex construction for exhausting the atmosphere to the point
of absolute vacuum.
"While I was looking at all this with amazement, Gornahoor Harharkh went
over to this complex pump and with his left wing moved one of its parts, thus
putting a certain mechanism in motion He then came back to us and, pointing
with the same special feather of his right wing to the largest 'life-chakhan,' or
'khrikhirkhi,' that is, 'dynamo,' continued his explanations:
'This particular appliance first sucks in separately all the three
independent parts of the omnipresent active element Okidanokh present in the
atmosphere or in any intraplanetary or surplanetary formation, and only when
these sep



arate parts have been artificially reblended into a single whole in the "khrikhirkhi" does Okidanokh, now in its usual state, flow into that "container," where it is concentrated.' Here he pointed, still with the same feather, to something very much like a 'condenser.' " 'From there,' he said, 'Okidanokh flows into another "khrikhirkhi," or "dynamo," where it undergoes the process of "djartklom"; and each of its separate parts is then concentrated in those other containers over there.' This time he pointed to what resembled 'accumulators.' 'Only then, by means of various artificial contrivances, do I take each active part of Okidanokh separately from these secondary containers for use in my experiments. " 'I shall first demonstrate what happens when, for any reason, one of the active parts of the Omnipresent Okidanokh is absent during the process of their "striving to reblend into a whole." 'At the present moment, inside this apparatus, there is indeed an absolute vacuum, made possible only by the special construction of the suction pump and by the quality and strength of the material of which the walls of this part of my new invention are made. Experiments in this absolute vacuum are also possible because of the special quality of the materials of which the instruments are made.'
"Having said this, Gornahoor Harharkh pulled another lever and continued: 'When this lever is pulled, there begins to take place within this empty
space the process whereby the separate parts of the Omnipresent Okidanokh
"strive to reblend into a whole."
'But since an "able Reason"—my own, in this case—• has by intention artificially excluded the third part of Okidanokh, known as "parijrahatnatius," the process is now taking place between only two of its independent parts,



which science calls "anodnatius" and "cathodnatius." consequently, instead of
the law-conformable results that would issue from the blending of the three
parts, a non-law-conformable result is now being actualized ensuing from
"the reciprocal blending of two opposite forces," and ordinary beings call this
result "the cause of artificial light."
" 'The "striving to reblend into a whole" of two active parts of the
Omnipresent Okidanokh now proceeding in this vacuum has a force,
calculated by Objective Science, of 3 040, 000 volts, and this force is
indicated by the needle of that appliance over there. '
"He pointed to 'something' very much like the apparatus called a 'voltmeter'
on your planet and said, 'One of the advantages of my new invention for the
demonstration of this phenomenon is that in spite of the extraordinary power
of the "force of striving" now proceeding there, the "salnichissinooarnian
momentum-vibrations," which should issue from this process, and which
most beings regard as "rays," do not issue from the place of their arising, that
is, the interior of this apparatus, where the particularities of the Omnipresent
Okidanokh are being studied.
" 'But in order that beings who are outside this part of my invention may
evaluate the force of this process, I purposely made the wall in one place out
of a material which allows the "salnichissinooarnian momentum-vibrations,"
or "rays," to pass through.'
"Having said this he went up to the 'hrakhartzakha' and pressed a certain
button Suddenly the enormous khrkh, or workshop, was flooded with such an
intense light that our organs of sight temporarily ceased to function, and only
after a considerable time could we, with great difficulty, raise our eyelids and
look around.
"As soon as we had recovered, Gornahoor Harharkh pulled another lever, which restored the surrounding space



to its usual appearance. Then in his customary angel voice he again drew our
attention to the needle of the voltmeter which steadily indicated the same
figure, and went on:
'You see, although the process of conflict between the two opposing
component parts of the Omnipresent Okidanokh still persists with the same
"force of striving," and the part of the wall of this apparatus that can let the
"rays" through is still open, the phenomenon that ordinary beings call
"artificial light" has ceased.
" 'And it has ceased because by pulling that lever just now I introduced into
the process of the clash between the two opposing parts a current of the third
component part of Okidanokh, whereupon this third part at once began to
blend proportionately with the other two. And the result of this blending of
the three component parts of the Omnipresent Okidanokh, unlike the process
of the non-law-conformable clash of its two parts, cannot be perceived by
beings with any of their being-functions.'
"After this explanation, Gornahoor Harharkh proposed that I should venture
with him inside the demonstrating part of his new invention, so that there
within I might become an eyewitness of certain particular manifestations of
the omnipresent and everywhere-penetrating active element.
"Without thinking long about it, I decided of course to do so; and I agreed
at once because I expected to receive in my being an unchangeable and
imperishable 'objective essence-satisfaction.'
"As soon as he had my consent, my future essence-friend gave the
necessary orders to one of his assistants.
"It appeared that various preparations had to be made before his proposal
could be earned out.
"First his assistants dressed Gornahoor Harharkh and myself in special, very heavy suits resembling what your favorites call 'diving suits' that had a large number of 'bolts.'



with small projecting heads. And when this most peculiar garb had been put
on us, the assistants tightened up the 'bolts' in a certain order.
"On the inner side of these diving suits, at the end of the bolts, there were,
it appeared, special plates which pressed against different parts of our
planetary bodies.
"Later it became obvious to me that this was necessary to prevent our
planetary bodies from undergoing what is called 'taranooranoora' or, in other
words, from falling to pieces, as usually occurs to all intraplanetary and
surplanetary formations when they happen to come into an entirely
atmosphereless space.
"Besides these suits, the assistants placed on our heads something like
'diving helmets,' with complicated 'connectors' projecting from them.
"One of these connectors, called 'harinkhrarkh,' meaning 'sustainer of the
pulsation,' was a sort of long rubber tube, one end of which was hermetically
attached by means of complicated appliances to the place on the helmet
corresponding to the breathing organs, while the other end, after we had
entered this strange 'hrakhartzakha,' was screwed into an apparatus connected
in its turn with the space whose presence corresponded with the 'second
being-food.'
"Between Gornahoor Harharkh and myself there was also a 'special
connector,' so that once inside the 'hrakhartzakha,' when the atmosphere had
been pumped out to produce an absolute vacuum, we could easily
communicate with each other.
"One end of this connector was fitted in a certain way, by means of
appliances on the helmets, to my organs of 'hearing' and 'speech,' and the
other end to those of Gornahoor Harharkh.
"Thus a sort of 'telephone,' as your favorites call it, was set up between my
future essence-friend and myself.
"Without this appliance we could not have communicated



with each other at all, chiefly because at that time the presence of Gornahoor
Harharkh was perfected only up to the state called the sacred 'Inkotsarno'; and
a being with such a presence cannot manifest himself nor even exist in an ab
solutely empty space, even if the products of all three being-foods were
artificially introduced into him.
"But the most curious, cunning, and subtly ingenious of all the connectors
attached for various purposes to these strange diving suits and helmets was
the one invented by the great scientist Gornahoor Harharkh to enable the
organ of 'sight' of ordinary beings to perceive surrounding objects in 'ab
solutely empty space.'
"One end of this astonishing connector was fitted to our temples by means
of appliances on the helmets, while the other end was fastened to a so-called
'ams-commutator,' in its turn connected by wires to all the objects that had to
be visible during the experiment, both those inside and outside the
'hrakhartzakha.'
"It is interesting to note here that at each end of this appliance—a creation
almost incredible for the Reason of an ordinary three-centered being—were
attached two further independent connectors, also of wire, through which
special 'magnetic currents' flowed from outside.
"As it was afterward explained to me in detail, these connectors had been
invented by that truly great scientist, Gornahoor Harharkh, so that by virtue
of a certain property of these 'magnetic currents,' also discovered by him, the
presence of learned three-centered beings—even those not perfected up to the
sacred 'Inkotsarno'—might be 'reflected' in their essence, and thanks to
another property of these currents, the presence of the objects mentioned
above might also be 'reflected.' Thus it was possible for their imperfect
organs of being-sight to perceive these objects, even in a vacuum containing
none of the factors, or results, of the



various cosmic concentrations which are animated by those vibrations that alone permit the functioning of any being-organ whatsoever.
"Having fitted us out in this very heavy equipment, which made it possible for
beings to exist in this unnatural environment, the assistants of the great all
universal scientist Gornahoor Harharkh, again with the help of special appli
ances, carried us into the 'hrakhartzakha' itself. Then, having screwed all the
free ends of the connectors projecting from us to the corresponding
apparatuses in the 'hrakhartzakha,' they went out and hermetically sealed
behind them the only way by which it would have been possible to have any
communication with what is called 'all that represents a world.'
"When we were alone in the 'hrakhartzakha,' Gornahoor Harharkh shifted
one of the 'switches' near him and said to me:
" 'Now the work of the pump has begun, and soon it will have pumped out
of here all the results, without exception, of those cosmic processes whose
totality is the basis and significance, and process itself of the maintenance of
existence of "all that represents a world."
"And he added in a somewhat sarcastic tone: 'Soon we shall be absolutely isolated from everything that exists and functions in the whole Universe. Yet thanks to my new invention and to the knowledge we have already attained, we now have the possibility not only of returning to the world, to become once again particles of all that exists, but also of being worthy to be nonparticipating eyewitnesses of certain world laws, which by ordinary uninitiated three-centered beings are considered inscrutable mysteries of Nature, but which in reality are natural and simple results automatically flowing one from another.'
"While he was speaking one could feel that the 'pump'



this very important part of his new invention—was carrying out perfectly the work assigned to it by being-Reason.
"To help you represent to yourself and understand better the perfection of this part of Gornahoor Harharkh's invention, I must tell you also the following: "Although for certain quite particular reasons I had had to be in
atmosphereless space on several occasions and to exist there as a three
brained being, sometimes for a long time, by means of the sacred
'kreemboolatsoomara' alone;
and although my presence had acquired from frequent repetition the habit of
moving gradually from one sphere to another, almost without feeling any
inconvenience from the change in the 'second being-food' inevitably brought
about by the transformation of the substances always present around both
large and small cosmic concentrations; and although the very causes of my
arising and the subsequent process of my being-existence had been arranged
in an entirely special way, so that gradually the various being-functions
within my common presence had perforce also become quite special,
nevertheless, in spite of all I have just said, the pumping out of the
atmosphere then proceeded with such force, and the sensations impressed on
the separate parts of my entire presence were so strong, that even today I can
very clearly relive the whole course of my experience at that moment and
describe it for you in detail.
"This extremely strange state began in me shortly after the pump started
working and Gornahoor Harharkh had spoken in that half-sarcastic tone about
our imminent situation.
"In my three 'being-centers,' that is, those centers localized in the presence
of every three-centered being under the names of the 'thinking,' 'feeling,' and
'moving' centers, there began to be perceived in each one of them separately,
in a strange and unusual way, the definite impression that each



of the separate parts of my whole planetary body was undergoing an
independent process of sacred 'rascooarno,' and that the cosmic
crystallizations composing the presence of each of these parts were flowing
'in vain.'
"At first my 'initiative of constatation' proceeded in the usual way
according to what is called the 'center of gravity of associative experiencing.'
But later, when this initiative of constatation gradually and almost
imperceptibly became the function of my essence alone, this essence became
the unique all-embracing initiator of constatation, not only of everything
taking place within me but also of everything without exception newly
happening outside me.
"From that moment my essence began to perceive impressions directly,
and to constate that from what was taking place in my common presence the
parts of my planetary body were, so to speak, being entirely destroyed, and
then little by little the localizations of the second and third being-centers as
well. At the same time my essence perceived that the functioning of these two
centers passed gradually to my thinking center, and became proper to it, with
the result that the thinking center, with this increased intensity of functioning,
became the 'unique and powerful perceiver' of everything actualized outside
itself as well as the autonomous initiator of constatation of everything
proceeding within the whole of my presence.
"While I was in the throes of this strange 'being-experiencing, ' still
incomprehensible to my Reason, Gornahoor Harharkh was busy pulling some
of the many levers and switches attached to the edges of the table at which we
were placed.
"And then something happened to Gornahoor Harharkh that suddenly
changed all this strange being-experiencing of mine, and in my common
presence the usual being-experiencing was resumed. This is what occurred:
Gornahoor Harharkh, with all the heavy equipment he was wearing,



suddenly found himself high above his chair and began to flounder, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin would say, 'like a puppy fallen into a deep pond.' "As we afterward learned, my friend Gornahoor Harharkh had made a
mistake while pulling the levers and switches, and had tensed certain parts of
his planetary body more than was necessary, and in consequence his presence,
together with everything he was wearing, had received a shock. Owing to the
'tempo' given to his presence from the taking in of the 'second being-food' and
to the absence of any resistance in that absolutely empty space, he began to
drift or, as I have just said, 'to flounder like a puppy in a pond.'
Having said this with a smile, Beelzebub became silent; after a short pause he
made a very strange gesture with his left hand, and in a tone of voice not
natural to him, continued:
"While I am recalling these events of a period so long ago in my existence,
the wish arises to make a sincere confession to you—just to you, one of my
direct heirs, who will inevitably represent the sum of all my deeds in the
course of my being-existence. That is to say, I wish to confess to you in all
sincerity that although my essence, with the consent of the parts of my
presence subject to it alone, had decided to participate in the scientific
experiment about to take place within Gornahoor Harharkh's new invention,
and although I had entered its chief demonstrating part without the least
compulsion from outside, yet this same essence of mine had allowed to creep
into my being and to develop there, side by side with the strange sensations I
have described to you, a criminally egoistic anxiety for the safety of my
personal existence.
"However, my boy, so that you may not be too distressed by this
confession, it is not superfluous to add that this was



the first time this ever happened to me, and also the last, throughout my entire being-existence. "But perhaps it would be better for the present not to touch on questions
that concern only our family.
"Let us rather return to my tale about the Omnipresent Okidanokh and my
essence-friend Gornahoor Harharkh who, by the way, was once recognized by
ordinary three-brained beings everywhere as a 'great scientist,' but is today no
longer considered 'great'; indeed, thanks to the fame of his own result, that is
to say, his son, he is now a 'has-been' or, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin
sometimes says in such cases, 'He is up to his neck in an old American
galosh.'
"Well then, while Gornahoor Harharkh was floundering about, he finally
managed, with great difficulty and only by means of a very complicated
maneuver, to get his planetary body, burdened as it was with its heavy and
unusual equipment, down onto the chair again, and this time he fastened it all
with screws that were on the chair for that purpose. When we were both more
or less settled again and could communicate by means of the artificial
connector I mentioned, he drew my attention to the three apparatuses hanging
over the table which, as I told you, looked like 'momonodooars.'
"On close inspection all three of these proved to be exactly alike in
appearance, each being a sort of 'socket' out of which projected 'carbon poles'
like those found in what your favorites call 'arc lights.'
"Having drawn my attention to these three objects resembling 'momonodooars,' he said: 'Each of these outwardly similar apparatuses has a direct connection
with the secondary containers I showed you while we were still outside the
"hrakhartzakha," and in



which all three active parts of Okidanokh, after the occurrence of the artificial
"djartklom," reblend into a single mass.
" 'I have constructed these three independent apparatuses in such a way
that in this absolutely empty space we can obtain from those secondary
containers as much of each of the active parts of Okidanokh, in a pure state,
as we need for our experiment; and we can also change at will the force of the
"striving to reblend into a whole" that is acquired by them and becomes
proper to them, according to the density of concentration of their mass.
" 'And now, within this absolutely empty space, I shall show you first of
all the same nonlawful phenomenon we observed a little while ago from
outside. In other words, I shall again demonstrate to you the cosmic
phenomenon that occurs when, after a lawful "djartklom," the separate parts
of Okidanokh meet in a space devoid of any cosmic concentration and,
without the participation of one of the parts, strive to reblend into a whole.'
"Having said this, he closed the section of the wall of the 'hrakhartzakha' that
had the property of allowing 'rays' to pass through, and then pulled two
switches and pressed a certain button, with the result that a small plate of
special mastic lying on the table automatically moved toward the 'carbon
poles.' Then, having again drawn my attention to the ammeter and the
voltmeter, he added:
'I have just now admitted the current of the two parts of Okidanokh called
"anodnatius" and "cathodnatius," giving them the same force of striving to
reblend.'
"When I looked at the ammeter and the voltmeter, and saw that their
needles had indeed moved and then stopped on the same figures I had noted
the first time while we were outside the 'hrakhartzakha,' I was greatly
surprised, for in spite of the indications of the needles and Gornahoor Har



harkh's warning, I had neither noticed nor sensed any change in the degree of
visibility of the objects around us.
"So without waiting for any further explanation, I
asked: " 'But why then is there no result from this nonlawful "striving to reblend
into a whole" of the parts of Okidanokh?'
"Before answering my question, he turned off the only lamp, which drew its
power from a special magnetic current. My astonishment increased even
more, for in spite of the sudden darkness I could clearly see through the walls
of the 'hrak-hartzakha' that the needles of the ammeter and voltmeter had
stayed in the same positions.
"Only after I had somehow or other adapted myself to this surprising
observation did Gornahoor Harharkh say:
" 'I have already told you that the material used for the walls of the
construction we are in right now has the property of not allowing any
vibrations from any source whatsoever to pass through it, with the exception
of certain vibrations arising from nearby concentrations; and these vibrations
can be perceived by the organs of sight of three-brained beings—provided, of
course, that these beings are normal.
'Furthermore, according to the law called "Heterato-getar," the
"salnichissinooarnian momentum-vibrations," or "rays," acquire the property
of acting on the organs of perception of beings only after having passed the
limit defined by science in the following terms: "the result of the
manifestation is in exact proportion to the force of striving received from the
shock."
'And so, since the process of the conflict of these two parts of
Okidanokh has a force of great intensity, the result is manifested at some
distance from the place of its origin.
'Now look!'



"He pressed another button, and suddenly the whole interior of the
'hrakhartzakha' was filled with the same blinding light that I had experienced
before, when I was standing outside this apparatus.
"This flood of light had apparently been released when Gornahoor
Harharkh, by pressing the button, had again opened the section of the wall of
the 'hrakhartzakha' that permitted 'rays' to pass through.
"He explained further that the light was a consequence of the 'striving to
reblend into a whole' of the parts of Okidanokh, which was proceeding in the
absolutely empty space inside the 'hrakhartzakha'; and it was manifested
there owing to what is called 'reflection from outside,' that is to say, to the
return of the rays to the place of their origin.
"He then continued: 'I am now going to demonstrate how and by what
combinations of the processes of "djartklom" and the "striving to reblend into
a whole" of the active parts of Okidanokh there arise in planets from the
"minerals" composing their interior presence certain definite formations of
varying densities, such as "mineraloids," "gases," "metalloids," "metals," and
so on. And I will show you how these latter, owing to the same factors, are
afterward progressively transformed one into another; and how the vibrations
flowing from these transformations constitute the "totality of vibrations" that
makes possible the "stability' of planets in the process called the "common
system harmonious movement."
" 'For my proposed demonstration, I must as always obtain the necessary
materials from outside, and my pupils will provide them by means of
appliances I have prepared in advance.'
"It is interesting to remark that while Gornahoor Harharkh was speaking, he
was tapping with his left foot on 'some



thing' very much like the transmission apparatus of the celebrated Morsecelebrated, be it said, only on the planet Earth.
"A few moments later, from the lower part of the 'hrakhartzakha' there
slowly rose a small object something like a box with transparent walls,
containing, as it afterward proved, certain 'minerals,' 'metalloids,' 'metals,' and
various 'gases' in liquid and solid states.
"Then with the help of various appliances arranged at one side of the table
and by means of complicated manipulations, he took out of the box a piece of
what is called 'red copper,' put it on the mastic plate before him, and said:
" 'This metal is a definite planetary crystallization, representing one of the
densities required for the said "stability" in the process of the "common
harmonious movement of all systems." It is a formation resulting from
previous processes of the reciprocal action of the parts of the Omnipresent
Okidanokh. Now I will allow the transformation of this metal to proceed
artificially at an accelerated pace, by means of the particularities of the same
factors.
" 'I intend to aid artificially the evolution and involution of its elements,
either toward a greater density or, on the contrary, back toward their primal
state.
" 'So that you may have a clearer picture of the whole experiment you are
about to witness, I shall have to give you at least a brief account of my own
first scientific deductions as to the causes and conditions that bring about the
crystallization, within planets, of the three separate parts of Okidanokh in one
or another of the definite formations I referred to.
" 'To begin with, from every non-law-conformable "djartklom" the separate
parts of the Omnipresent Okidanokh become localized in the medium of that
part of the presence of the planet where the "djartklom" has taken place,



that is to say, in whatever corresponding mineral is there at that moment. 'Now if the density of the elements of that medium has an "affinity of
vibrations" with one of the active parts of the Omnipresent Okidanokh, then,
according to the world law called "symmetrical interpenetration," this active
part blends with the presence of the medium, to become an inseparable part
of it. And from that moment, the separate parts of Okidanokh, combined with
the elements of the given medium, begin to represent the corresponding
densities required in planets, that is to say, various kinds of "metalloids" or
even "metals," as for instance the metal existing under the name of "red
copper," which I have just placed in this medium and where, at my wish, the
"striving to reblend into a whole" of the parts of Okidanokh will now proceed
artificially.
'Further, having thus arisen within the planets, these various
"metalloids" and "metals" begin—as is proper to all arisings in which
Okidanokh or any one of its active parts participate—to radiate from their
presence the results of their "inner interchange of substances" according to
the universal law called the "reciprocal feeding of everything existing." And,
as is proper to all radiations issuing from surplanetary and intraplanetary
formations, the radiations of these "metalloids" and "metals" acquire a
property almost like that of Okidanokh or of any one of its active parts,
present in what is called the "center of gravity" of all such formations.
'When these masses of different densities, which have thus arisen in
planets under normal surrounding conditions, radiate the vibrations required
for this universal law of the "reciprocal feeding of everything existing," then,
among these vibrations having various properties, there is established,
according to the fundamental world law of "Troemedekhfe," a reciprocally
acting contact.



" 'And it is the result of this contact which is the chief factor in the gradual
change of the various densities in planets.
" 'My observations over many years have almost fully convinced me that it
is only this contact and its results that assure the "stability of the harmonious
equilibrium" of planets.
" 'The metal, red copper, which I have just placed in this sphere where I
propose to set in motion in an artificial way the active parts of Okidanokh, has
at this moment a specific density of 444, reckoning from the unit of density of
the sacred element Theomertmalogos; that is to say, an atom of this metal is
444 times denser and as many times less vivifying than an atom of the sacred
Theomertmalogos.
" 'Now watch and see in what order the artificially accelerated
transformations will take place.'
"Having said this, he put in front of my organ of sight an automatically
controlled teskooano, then began to turn several switches on and off in a
certain sequence; and as I looked through the teskooano, he gave me the
following explanation:
" 'I am now allowing all three parts of Okidanokh to flow into the sphere
of presence containing this metal; and since all three parts have the same
"density," and hence the same "force of striving," they reblend into a whole
without changing anything in the presence of the metal. And the Omnipresent
Okidanokh thus obtained flows in its usual state through a special conduit out
of the "hrakhartzakha," and is reconcentrated in the first container, which you
have already seen. " 'Now look!
'I am deliberately increasing the "force of striving" of just one of the active parts of Okidanokh. In this case I am



increasing the force called "cathodnatius," and you will see that the elements
composing the presence of the "red copper" begin to involve toward the
quality of the substances that compose the ordinary presence of planets.'
"While explaining this he was turning various switches on and off in a certain sequence. "Well, my boy, although I watched everything that went on very
attentively and everything I saw was impressed in my essence
'pestolnootiarly,' that is, forever, I could not now, however much I might
wish to do so, put into words a hundredth part of what then took place in that
small fragment of an intraplanetary formation. Nor shall I even try to do so,
for I have just thought of a way of actually showing it all to you so that you
too can soon be an eyewitness of that astonishing cosmic process.
"Meanwhile, I will only tell you that there proceeded in that fragment of
'red copper' something rather like those frightful scenes among your favorites
on the Earth that I occasionally observed through my teskooano from the
planet Mars.
"I say 'rather like' because what I sometimes observed among your
favorites was only at its beginning, whereas in that fragment of 'red copper' I
was able to observe the whole process right up to its final transformation.
"A rough parallel can be drawn between what occasionally happens on
your planet and what took place then in the small fragment of copper, if you
imagine yourself high up, looking down upon a large public square where
thousands of your favorites, seized with the most acute form of their chief
psychosis, are destroying one another's existence by every means they have
invented, and then suddenly in their place you see their 'corpses,' as they call
them, which change color perceptibly owing to the outrages done them by
the beings not yet destroyed, and this gradually alters the general appearance
of the surface of that large square.



"Now, my boy, by switching on and off the flow of the three active parts of
Okidanokh, thus changing their 'force of striving,' this future essence-friend of
mine, Gornahoor Harharkh, also changed the density of the elements of the
'red copper,' and thereby transformed this metal into all kinds of other
intraplanetary metals of lower or higher degree of vivifyingness.
"And here, to throw more light upon the strangeness of the psyche of the
three-brained beings who have taken your fancy, it is interesting and
important to note that while Gornahoor Harharkh, by means of his new
invention, was artificially producing the evolution and involution in density
and vivifyingness of the elements of 'red copper,' I noticed distinctly that this
metal was transformed at one point into that very metal about which many
sorry scientists of your planet have been wiseacring for nearly the whole of
their existence, in the hope of transforming other metals into it —thus leading
astray their already sufficiently erring brethren. On Earth this metal is called
'gold.'
" 'Gold' is no other than the metal we call 'prtzathalavr,' whose specific
gravity, reckoning as always from the sacred Theomertmalogos, is 1, 439; that
is to say, an atom of 'gold' is three and a fraction times less vivifying than an
atom of 'red copper.'
"The reason I decided not to try to explain in words everything that took place
in that fragment of 'red copper' was because I suddenly remembered the all
gracious promise given me by our All-Quarters Maintainer, the Most Great
Arch-Cherub Peshtvogner, which will make it possible for you to see with
your own eyes, in definite intraplanetary formations, the processes of the
manifestations of the active parts of Okidanokh.
"And this all-gracious promise was given me just after



my return from exile, when my first duty was to present myself to our All
Quarters Maintainer, the Arch-Cherub Peshtvogner and, prostrating myself at
his feet, to perform before him what is called the 'essence-sacred
aliamizoornakalu.'
"I was obliged to do this on account of the sins of my youth. For when I
was pardoned by His Uni-Being Endlessness and allowed to return to my
native land, certain Sacred Individuals decided to demand of me that this
sacred process be performed over my essence, both as a precaution against
my ever again manifesting myself as in the days of my youth, and so that
nothing similar would recur in the Reason of most of the Individuals dwelling
at the Center of the Great Universe.
"You probably do not yet know what the sacred 'aliamizoornakalu' over an
essence means. Later I will explain that to you in detail, but meanwhile, I
shall simply turn once more to our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin, who describes
this process as 'giving one's word of honor not to poke one's nose into the
affairs of the authorities.'
"In short, when I presented myself to our All-Quarters Maintainer he
deigned to ask me, among other things, whether I had brought back with me
all the being-inventions that had interested me and that I had collected from
various planets of that solar system where I had existed during my exile. I
replied that I had brought back almost everything except those cumbersome
apparatuses that my friend Gornahoor Harharkh had constructed for me on
the planet Mars.
"He at once promised to give orders that everything I indicated should be
put on board the space ship Omnipresent on its next trip.
"So I hope, my boy, that everything necessary will have been brought to
our planet Karatas and that when we return there, you will be able to see the
experiments with your



own eyes and I shall be able to explain everything in detail. "In the
meantime, during this journey of ours on the ship Karnak, I will tell you, in
their order, as I have already promised, about my descents to your planet and
the reasons for my appearances there in person."



CHAPTER 19
Beelzebub's tale about his second
descent to the planet Earth
BEELZEBUB began thus: "I descended to your planet Earth for the second time only eleven of their centuries after my first descent. "Shortly after my first descent a second catastrophe had occurred to that planet, but this one was local in character and did not threaten disaster on a great cosmic scale. "During this second catastrophe, the continent of Atlantis, which at the
time of my first descent had been the largest continent and the chief place of
existence of the terrestrial three-brained beings, was engulfed within the
planet along with other large and small land masses, as were most of the
three-brained beings existing upon them, together with almost everything
they had achieved and acquired in the course of centuries.
"In their place there emerged from within the planet other land masses
forming new continents and islands, most of which still exist.
"It was on this very continent of Atlantis that the city of Samlios was situated where, do you remember, that young countryman of ours had existed who was the cause of my first descent in person. "During this second great disaster to that planet, thanks to diverse
circumstances, many of the three-brained beings who have taken your fancy
nevertheless survived, and by the time of my second descent in person their
posterity had already multiplied so much that they were now breeding on
almost all the newly formed land masses.
"And in regard to the causes, conforming to law, which



brought about their excessive multiplication, this also you will understand in
the course of my further tales.
"Here, my boy, it will do no harm for you to take note that the beings of our
tribe existing on that planet at the time of this catastrophe all escaped that
'apocalyptic end.'
"They escaped it for the following reasons: "As I have already told you in one of our previous talks, at the time of my
first descent most of the beings of our tribe who had chosen this planet of
yours as their dwelling place existed on the continent of Atlantis.
"It appears that a year before this catastrophe our 'tribal pythoness' made a
prophecy in which she called upon all our tribe to leave the continent of
Atlantis and migrate to a smaller continent not far away, where they were to
exist on a definite part of its surface that she indicated.
"This smaller continent was then called 'Grabontzi' and the part the
'pythoness' indicated did indeed escape the terrifying perturbation that
occurred to all the other parts of the common presence of that ill-fated planet.
"As a consequence of this perturbation the continent of Grabontzi, existing
today under the name of 'Africa,' became much larger, as other land masses
emerged from the water spaces of the planet and were added to it.
"So, my boy, our 'pythoness' was able to warn those members of our tribe
who had been obliged to exist on your planet and thereby save them from an
otherwise inevitable 'apocalyptic end'; and she was able to do this thanks to a
special being-property which, by the way, can be acquired by beings only
intentionally by means of what is called 'being-partkdolgduty,' about which I
will tell you later.
"This time the reasons for my descent to the surface of that I planet were
related to the following events:
"One day, on the planet Mars, we received an etherogram from the Center announcing the imminent appearance of



certain Most High Sacred Individuals. And in fact, within half a Martian year,
a number of archangels, angels, cherubim, and seraphim did appear there, the
majority of whom had been members of the Most High Commission that had
come to Mars at the time of the first great catastrophe to the planet Earth.
"Among these Most High Sacred Individuals was again His Conformity,
the Angel—now already Archangel— Looisos who, during the first great
catastrophe to the planet Earth, as you remember I recently told you, had been
one of the chief administrators in charge of averting the possible
consequences of that general cosmic misfortune.
"So, my boy, the day after the second appearance of those Sacred
Individuals, His Conformity, accompanied by one of the seraphim, his second
assistant, did me the honor to come to my house.
"After giving me his blessing, His Conformity condescended to reply to
certain inquiries of mine about the Great Center, and then told me that after
the collision of the comet Kondoor with the planet Earth, he and other
responsible cosmic Individuals administering the affairs of 'harmonious
world-existence' had frequently descended to this solar system to observe the
effect of the measures they had taken to ward off the consequences of that
cosmic miscalculation.
'And we descended,' His Conformity continued, 'because, although we
had taken every possible precaution and had assured everyone that everything
would be quite all right, we ourselves were not totally convinced that some
unforeseen unpleasantness might not await us in the future.
" 'Moreover it turned out that our apprehensions were partly justified
though, thanks to chance, not in a serious form, that is to say, not on a general
cosmic scale, since this new catastrophe affected only the planet Earth.
" 'The second catastrophe to the planet Earth,' continued His Conformity, 'was due to the following circumstances:



" 'When, during the first disaster, two large fragments were detached
from this planet, the "center of gravity" of its entire presence had no
time to shift to a corresponding new position. As a result, right up to the
time of the second catastrophe, this planet existed with its "center of
gravity" out of place, thanks to which ifs movement during that whole
period was not uniformly harmonious and there often occurred, both
within and upon it, various upheavals and displacements And it was just
when the "center of gravity" finally shifted to the true center of the
planet that the second catastrophe occurred.
" 'But from now on,' added His Conformity with a shade of self
satisfaction, 'the existence of this planet will be quite normal from the
point of view of common-cosmic harmony. This second cataclysm has
finally put our minds completely at rest, and has convinced us that a
catastrophe on a cosmic scale can never again occur on account of the
planet Earth.
'Not only has this planet once more acquired a normal movement in the
general cosmic equilibrium, but its two detached fragments, now called
"Moon" and "Anulios," have also acquired a normal movement and
have become independent, though small, "kofenshars," that is,
additional planets, of the solar system Ors.
Having thought a moment, His Conformity went on to say: 'I have appeared to you, Your Reverence, just in order to talk over with
you the future welfare of the large fragment of that planet existing
today under the name of "Moon."
" 'Not only,' His Conformity continued, 'has this fragment become an
independent planet, but there is already proceeding on it the formation
of an atmosphere, as is necessary for every planet serving the
actualization of the Most Great Common-Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat.
But now, Your



Reverence, on that small, unexpectedly arisen planet, this regular process of the formation of an atmosphere is being hindered by an undesirable circumstance due to the three-brained beings existing on the planet Earth. " 'And this is why I decided to appeal to you, Your Reverence, to consent to undertake, in the name of our Uni-Being Creator, a task that would spare us the necessity of resorting to some extreme sacred process, unbecoming for any three-centered beings, and would, in some simpler way, remove this undesirable phenomenon by making use of the being-Reason they have in their presence.' "His Conformity then explained to me in detail that after the second
catastrophe to the Earth, the biped three-brained beings who had accidentally
survived had again multiplied, and that the whole process of their existence
was now concentrated on a large, newly formed continent called 'Ashhark,'
where three large independent groups had been established, the first in a
region then called 'Tikliamish,' the second in a region known as
'Maralpleicie,' and the third in a country which still exists and was then called
'Pearl-land.'
'In the psyche of the beings belonging to all three of these independent groups,' His Conformity went on to say, 'various peculiar "havatviernonis" have been formed, that is, certain psychic strivings, the total process of which they themselves call "religion." " 'Although these havatviernonis, or religions, have nothing in common, there is widely spread among all three groups a religious custom called "sacrificial offerings." This custom of theirs is based on the notion, which only their strange Reason could conceive of, that if they destroyed the existence of beings of other forms in honor of their "gods' and "idols," these imaginary gods and idols would find it very, very agreeable, and would help them without fail, always and in everything, to carry out their wild and fantastic enterprises.



" 'This custom is now so widespread there and the destruction of the
existence of beings of various forms has reached such proportions, that there
is already a surplus of the sacred "askokin" required from the planet Earth for
the maintenance of its former parts, a surplus, that is, of those vibrations that
arise during the process of "rascooarno" of beings of every exterior form on
that planet from which this sacred cosmic substance is required.
" 'This surplus of the sacred "askokin" is already seriously hindering the
correct exchange of substances between the Moon and its atmosphere, with
the danger that the atmosphere may in consequence be formed abnormally,
and later become an obstacle to the harmonious movement of the whole
system Ors, and perhaps again give rise to yet another catastrophe on a great
cosmic scale.
" 'So, Your Reverence, my request consists in this, that since you are in the
habit of often visiting various planets of this solar system, you should
undertake the task of descending specially to the planet Earth and of trying to
instill into the consciousness of these strange three-brained beings some idea
of the senselessness of this notion of theirs.'
"After a few more words, His Conformity began to ascend, and when he
was fairly high up, he added in a loud voice: 'Thereby, Your Reverence, you
will be rendering a great service to our Uni-Being All-Embracing
Endlessness.'
"When these Sacred Individuals had left the planet Mars, I resolved to carry
out this task at all costs and to be worthy, If only by this specific aid to our
Unique Burden-Bearing Endlessness, of becoming a particle, though an
independent one, of everything existing in the Great Universe. So, my boy,
imbued with this resolve, the next day I flew on the same ship Occasion to
your planet Earth.
"This time our ship alighted on a sea then called the 'Colhidius,' recently
formed by perturbations during the second



great disaster to your planet. This sea was situated in the northwestern part of
the great, newly arisen continent of Ashhark, which at that period was the
chief center of existence of the three-brained beings there.
"The other shores of this sea belonged to those newly emerged land
masses that had become joined to the continent of Ashhark, and taken
together were at first known as 'Frianktzanaralis' and a little later as
'Colhidchissi.' It must be remarked that both this sea and the lands just
mentioned still exist, but of course they now have other names. For example,
the continent of Ashhark is now called 'Asia'; the Colhidius Sea, the
'Caspian'; and all the Frianktzanaralis together are now known as the
'Caucasus.'
"The Occasion alighted on the Colhidius, or Caspian, Sea because it was
the most convenient place for mooring our ship; moreover, it offered great
advantages for my further travels, since a large river, which watered almost
the entire country of Tikliamish, flowed into it from the east. On the banks of
this river stood the capital, the city of 'Koorkalai.'
"As the greatest center of existence of these favorites of yours was then
the country of 'Tikliamish,' I decided to go there first.
"Here it might as well be added that although this large river, then called
the 'Oxoseria,' still exists today, it no longer flows into the Caspian Sea
because, as a result of a minor planetary tremor, it was diverted to the north
about halfway down its course and flowed into one of the hollows on the
surface of the continent of Ashhark, where it gradually formed a small sea
still known as the 'Aral Sea.' By close observation the old bed of that great
river now called the " 'Amu Darya' can be seen even at the present day.
"At the time of this second descent of mine in person, the country of
Tikliamish had come to be considered, as indeed



it was, the richest and most fertile of all the lands suitable for ordinary being
existence on that planet.
"But when a third great catastrophe occurred to that ill-fated planet, this
flourishing country, along with other more or less fertile regions, was covered
by 'kashmanoonoms,' or as they say, by 'sands.' After this third catastrophe the
country of Tikliamish was long known as the 'Hungry Desert'; but nowadays
the different parts have different names, and what was once its principal part
is called 'Karakum,' which means 'black sands.'
"During that period the second quite independent group of three-brained
beings on the continent of Ashhark dwelt in the country then called
'Maralpleicie.' Later, when this second group established a central place of
existence, they called it the city of 'Gob,' and for a long time the whole
country was called 'Goblandia.'
"This region in its turn was covered by 'kashmanoonoms,' and today the
chief part of this once flourishing country is known simply as the 'Gobi
Desert.'
"As for the third entirely independent group, the place of its existence was
in the southeastern part of the continent of Ashhark, opposite Tikliamish, and
on the other side of those abnormal projections of the continent that had been
formed during the second catastrophe to this ill-fated planet.
"As I have already told you, the place of existence of this third group was
then called Pearl-land.
"The name of this region also was changed many times, and at present the
whole of that part of the land surface of your planet is known as 'Hindustan'
or 'India.'
"It must be noted here without fail that at the time of my second descent in
person to the surface of your planet, there
Was present in all the three-brained beings of these three independent groups,
instead of the impulse called 'needful.'



striving for self-perfection,' which should be in every three-brained being, an also needful but very strange striving already thoroughly crystallized, to have all the other beings of their planet consider their country the 'center of culture' of the whole Earth. "This very strange needful striving had become for each of the threecentered beings of your planet the principal meaning and aim of existence and, in consequence, bitter struggles, both material and psychic, were constantly proceeding among the beings of the three independent groups for the attainment of this aim.
"So, my boy . . . "From the Colhidius Sea, now the Caspian, we then set off on
'selchanakhs,' that is, on rafts of a special kind, up the river Oxoseria or, as it
is now called, the 'Amu Darya.' We sailed for fifteen terrestrial days and
finally arrived at the capital of the beings of the first Asiatic group.
"As soon as we were settled in the city of Koorkalai I began visiting the 'kaltaani' there, that is, those establishments which were later called on the continent of Ashhark 'chaikhanas,' 'ashkhanas,' 'caravanserais,' and so on, and which contemporary beings on that planet, especially those breeding on the continent of 'Europe,' call 'cafés,' 'restaurants,' 'clubs,' 'dance halls,' 'meeting places,' and so on. "I began with these establishments because on the planet Earth, in those
days just as now, there was no place where one could observe and study so
well the specific peculiarities of the psyche of the beings of a country. And
this was exactly what I needed in order to make clear to myself their real,
inner essence-attitude toward the custom of sacrificial offerings, and to
enable me more readily to draw up a plan of action to achieve the aim for
which I had made this second descent to your planet.
"During my visits to those kaltaani I met a number of



beings, among whom was one I happened to see rather often. This threebrained being whom I frequently met was by profession a 'priest'; his name was Abdil. "Since most of my personal activities during this second descent were
concerned with the external circumstances in which this priest Abdil had
become involved, and since I had to go to a great deal of trouble on his
account, I shall tell you about him more or less in detail. Moreover, from
these tales you will be able to understand the results I obtained in pursuit of
my aim of uprooting from the strange psyche of your favorites their need to
destroy the existence of beings of other forms in order to 'please and appease'
their gods and revered idols.
"Although this terrestrial being, who afterward became as dear to me as
one of my own kin, was not a priest of the highest rank, he was well versed
in the teaching of the religion then dominant in Tikliamish, and also knew
well the psyche of the followers of that religion, particularly of course of the
members of what is called his 'flock.'
"As soon as we were on friendly terms, I discovered that in the being of
the priest Abdil, owing to many external circumstances, among others his
heredity and the conditions in which he had been prepared to become a
responsible being, the function called 'conscience,' which should be present
in every three-centered being, was not yet altogether atrophied. So, when he
recognized with his Reason certain cosmic truths I explained to him, he at
once acquired in his presence almost that attitude toward other beings that is
proper to all normal three-brained beings of the whole universe; in other
words he became 'compassionate' and 'sensitive' to the beings around him.
"Before I tell you more about this priest Abdil, you must know that on the continent of Ashhark the terrible custom of sacrificial offerings was then at its height, and that the



destruction of various weak 'one-brained' and 'two-brained' beings was proceeding everywhere in incalculable numbers. "At that period, whenever the members of a household appealed to some imaginary 'god' or make-believe 'saint,' they invariably vowed that in return for good fortune they would destroy, in honor of that god or saint, the existence of some being, or even of several at once. And if by chance good fortune befell them, they would fulfill their vow with the utmost piety; while if it turned out otherwise, they would increase the slaughter, in the hope of eventually winning the favor of their imaginary patron. "For this purpose these favorites of yours went so far as to divide the
beings of all other forms into 'clean' and 'unclean.' They called 'unclean' those
beings the destruction of whose existence was supposedly displeasing to their
gods, and 'clean' those beings whose destruction was supposedly most
agreeable to the various fantastic idols they revered.
"These sacrifices were offered not only privately by individual beings in their own houses, but also by large groups and sometimes by the whole populace. They even had special places for slaughterings of this kind, preferably near buildings erected in memory of something or somebody, usually of some 'saint'—a 'saint,' of course, whom they themselves had elevated to sainthood. "There were several of these public places at that time in the country of Tikliamish, where the mass destruction of beings of different exterior forms was carried out, and the most celebrated of these was on top of a small mountain, where once upon a time a certain wonder-worker, Aliman, was supposed to have been 'taken up alive' to some heaven or other. "In this place, as in others like it, especially at set times of the year, they destroyed vast numbers of beings called 'oxen,' 'sheep,' 'doves,' and so onand sometimes even



beings like themselves. In the last case, the strong usually brought the less
strong to be sacrificed: a father, for instance, brought his son; a husband his
wife; an elder brother his younger brother, and so on. But for the most part the
victims were 'slaves,' who were usually what are called 'captives,' in other
words, beings of a conquered community which had lost its importance
through the action of the law of 'Solioonensius'; that is, in a period when the
tendency to reciprocal destruction was intensified in the presence of your
favorites.
"This custom of 'pleasing their gods' by destroying the existence of other
beings is still followed on your planet, though not on the same scale as when
these abominations were perpetrated on the continent of Ashhark.
"Well, my boy, during the early days of my stay in the town of Koorkalai I
often talked with my friend the priest Abdil on various subjects, taking care of
course to avoid questions that might have betrayed my real nature.
"Like almost all the three-brained beings I met on each of my descents, he
took me for a being of his own planet, but considered me very learned and an
authority on the psyche of his fellow beings.
"From our earliest meetings, the sensitivity and concern with which he
spoke about beings like himself always touched me deeply. And when my
Reason had clearly recognized that the function of 'conscience,' transmitted to
him by heredity and fundamental for all three-centered beings, had not yet
quite atrophied in him, there arose, and eventually became crystallized in my
presence, a 'really func
tioning needful striving' toward him, as though he were a kinsman of my own nature. From that moment, according to the cosmic law that 'every cause gives birth to a corresponding result,' the priest



Abdil began to experience 'silnegordpana' toward me, or as your favorites would say, a feeling of 'trusting another as oneself.' "So, my boy, no sooner was all this clearly evident to my Reason than the idea occurred to me to avail myself of this first terrestrial friend of mine to accomplish the task for the sake of which my second descent had been made. And I then began intentionally leading all our conversations toward the question of sacrificial offerings. "Although many years have passed since I talked with that terrestrial friend of mine, I can still remember one of our conversations and repeat it to you word for word. I wish to repeat that particular talk, which was the last I had with him, because it served as the starting point of all the events which, though they brought the planetary existence of my terrestrial friend to a painful end, nevertheless opened to him the possibility of continuing the task of self-perfecting.
"This last talk took place in his house. "I explained to him frankly the utter stupidity and absurdity of the custom of sacrificial offerings. "What I said was this: 'Good. You have a religion, a faith in something. It is very good to have faith in something, whatever it may be, even if you don't know exactly in whom or in what—even if you have not the least idea of the significance and the possibilities of what you have faith in. To have faith, whether consciously or even quite unconsciously, is very necessary and desirable for every being. 'And it is desirable because it is by faith, and by faith alone, that there
can appear the intensity of being-self-consciousness necessary for everyone,
as well as the valuation of one's own personal being as a particle of
everything existing in the Universe.
" 'But what has the destruction of the existence of another being to do with
this faith—above all when you destroy it in the name of its Creator? Does not
that "life," which



He created as He created yours, have the same value as your own?
" 'Making use of your psychic strength and cunning, that is, those data with
which our Common Creator has endowed you for the perfecting of your
Reason, you take advantage of the psychic weakness of other beings and
destroy their existence.
" 'Do you understand, you wretched creature, what an evil deed, in the
objective sense, you commit by this?
" 'First of all, by destroying the existence of other beings you reduce for
yourself the number of factors, the sum of whose results can alone provide the
conditions required for the self-perfecting of beings like yourself; and in the
second place, you diminish or entirely destroy the hopes of our Common
Father Creator in those possibilities put into you as a three-brained being upon
whom He counts as a help for the future.
" 'The absurdity of this terrible being-action is already obvious in your
imagining that by destroying the existence of another being you are doing
something pleasing to the very One who intentionally created that being. Can
it be that the thought has never even entered your head that if our Common
Father Creator also created this "life," He probably did so for some definite
purpose?'
" Think,' I said further, 'think a little, not like a "Khorassanian donkey," as you
have been used to thinking during your whole existence, but think a little
honestly and sincerely, as is proper for a being to think who is, as you say
yourself, made "in the image of God." Could it be that, when creating you and
the beings you destroy, our Creator would have written on the foreheads of
certain of His own Creatures that they were to be destroyed in His honor and
glory? Anyone who thinks seriously and sincerely about it, even an idiot from
"Albion's Isles," will be able to understand that this could never be.



'This is only an invention of men—men who say they are "in the image
and likeness of God"; it does not come from Him who created men and these
other beings of different forms which they destroy, as they fancy, for His
pleasure and satisfaction. For Him there is no difference between the life of
men and the life of beings of any other | form. Men are "life" and the beings of
other exterior forms I are "life."
'In His wisdom He has foreseen that Nature should adapt different
exterior forms of beings to the conditions and circumstances in which the
process of their existence is destined to flow.
'Take yourself, for example: with your internal and external organs,
could you go jump into the water and live there like a fish?
'Of course not, because you have neither the "gills," "fins," nor "tail" of a
fish: you are not a "life" destined to exist in a medium such as water.
" 'If it occurred to you to go live in the water, you would soon choke, and
sink to the bottom, where you would become hors d'oeuvre for those same
fish who, in their own medium, would naturally be incomparably stronger
than you.
'It is the same for the fish. Could one of them come and sit at this table
with us and sip the "green tea" we are now enjoying? Certainly not! It has not
the corresponding organs for manifestations of this kind.
'It was created for the water, and its internal and external organs are
adapted to that clement, which is the only one where it can manifest itself
effectively, and fulfill the purpose of its existence preordained by the Creator.
'Again in your case, your external and internal organs were created by
our Common Creator in a corresponding manner. You are given feet so that
you can walk, and hands to prepare and take the necessary food. Your nose
and the



organs connected with it are so adapted that you may take in and transform in
yourself those cosmic substances that serve, in three-brained beings like
yourself, to coat the two higher being-bodies—on one of which rests the hope
of our Common All-Embracing Creator, for help in His need to actualize what
He has foreseen for the good of everything existing.
" 'In short, our Common Creator has given Nature the corresponding
principle that enables her to coat and adapt all your internal and external
organs in accordance with that sphere in which the process of existence of
beings with such a brain-system as yours is destined to flow.
" 'To illustrate this, take your own "donkey," now tied up in its stall. Even in
regard to your own donkey, you abuse the possibilities given you by our
Common Creator, for if this donkey is compelled to stand unwillingly in your
stable, it does so only because it was created two-brained; and it was created
two-brained because that organization of its common presence is necessary for
cosmic existence on the planet. And therefore it is according to law that the
possibility of "logical mentation" is lacking in your donkey's presence and, in
consequence, it is according to law that it should be what you call "dull
witted" or "stupid."
" 'As for yourself, although you were created for this same purpose of cosmic
existence on planets, you were created also as a "field of hope" for our
Common All-Gracious Creator, in other words, with the possibility of coating
in your presence that Higher Sacred for whose arising the whole of our now
existing world was created. Yet in spite of the possibilities given you, that is,
in spite of your having been created three-brained and thus capable of logical
mentation, you do not use this sacred property for its preordained purpose, but
manifest it as "cunning" toward His other creatures such as, for example, your
own donkey.



'Apart from the possibilities given you of consciously coating this Higher Sacred in your presence, your donkey has the same value for the common-cosmic process, and consequently for our Common Creator, as yourself, since each of you is predestined for some definite purpose, and all these different purposes, taken together, constitute the meaning of everything existing. " 'The only difference between you and your donkey lies in the form and quality of functioning of the internal and external organization of your common presence. For instance, you have only two legs, whereas your donkey has four, any one of which is immeasurably stronger than yours. Can you on those two weak legs of yours carry as much as that donkey can? Certainly not, because your legs were given you only for carrying yourself and the little that is necessary for the normal existence of a three-brained being as foreseen by Nature. " 'This unequal distribution of power and strength, which at first sight may appear unjust on the part of our Most Just Creator, was made by Great Nature solely because the surplus of cosmic substances granted you by the foresight of the Creator and by Nature for the purpose of personal self-perfecting is not given to your donkey, but instead of this Great Nature herself transforms this surplus of cosmic substance in the donkey's presence—without, of course, the donkey being aware of it—into the power and strength of certain of its organs for its present existence alone, thus enabling it to manifest that power incomparably better than you. 'And these manifestations of the different powers of beings of diverse forms constitute in their totality the exterior conditions that alone make it possible for three-brained beings like yourself consciously to perfect the "germ of Reason" placed in their presence to the required gradation of pure Objective Reason.



" 'I repeat: all beings, large and small, of all brain systems without exception, existing on the Earth, within the Earth, in the air, or beneath the waters—all are equally necessary to our Common Creator for the common harmony of universal existence.
" 'And since all these forms of beings, taken as a whole, constitute the
form of the process of universal existence required by our Creator, the
essence of each being is equally dear and equally valuable to Him. For our
Common Creator all beings are only particles of the existence of one whole
Essence spiritualized by Himself.
" 'But what do we see around us here now? One of the forms of beings
created by Him, the very form in whose presence He has placed all His
hopes for the future welfare of everything existing, taking advantage of its
superiority to lord it over other forms, destroying their existence right and
left and, what is more, allegedly "in His Name."
" 'These monstrous and sacrilegious acts are committed in every house
and on every square, yet it never enters the head of any of these unfortunates
that those beings whose existence you and I are destroying are just as dear to
Him who created them as we ourselves, and that if He created those other
forms of beings it must also have been for some purpose.'
"Having said all this to my friend, the priest Abdil, I went on: 'And the most deplorable thing is that every man who destroys the existence of other beings in honor of his revered idols does so with all his heart, convinced beyond any doubt that he is doing a "good deed." 'If any one of them should become aware that in destroying the existence of another being he is not only committing an evil deed against the true God and every real saint, but is even causing them, in their essence, sorrow and grief that there should exist in the Great Universe such mon



sters made "in the image of God," who can manifest themselves so ruthlessly
and without conscience toward other creatures of our Common Father—I
repeat, if any one of them should become aware of this, he would certainly
agree with all his heart never again to destroy the existence of beings of other
forms for sacrificial offerings.
'Then perhaps on the Earth also there would be observed the eighteenth commandment of our Common Creator " ' "Love everything that breathes. " 'Destroying the existence of His other creatures as an offering to God is
just like some vandal breaking into your house and wantonly destroying all
the "goods" there that have taken you years to collect and cost you so much
labor and suffering.
'Think—but I say again, think seriously Picture to yourself what I have
just said and then tell me would you like it? Would you thank the shameless
vandal who broke into your house? No! A million times no! On the contrary,
your whole being would be outraged, you would want to punish the
scoundrel, and with every fiber of your psyche you would try to find a means
of revenge.
" 'You would no doubt reply that all this is true enough and so on and so
forth, "but after all I am only a man " Yes, indeed, you are only a man It is
fortunate that God is God, and not vindictive and evil like man Certainly He
will not punish you or take revenge upon you, as you would have done to the
vandal who destroyed the goods it had taken you years to collect.
'It goes without saying God forgives everything—this has even become
a law in the world.
" 'But His creatures—men in this case—should not abuse His all-gracious
and everywhere-penetrating Goodness, it is their duty not only to watch over
all that He has created but also to maintain it.
" 'Yet here on Earth men have even divided beings of all



other forms into "clean" and "unclean." Tell me, what guided them when they
made this division? Why, for instance, is a sheep "clean" and a lion
"unclean"? Are they not equally beings? This also was invented by men. But
why this invention, why this distinction? Simply because the sheep is a weak
being, and moreover stupid, and they can do just what they like with it.
" 'But men call the lion "unclean" only because they dare not do what they
like with it. The lion is cleverer and above all stronger than they are. Not
only will the lion not allow itself to be destroyed, it will not even let people
come near it. And if anyone should venture too close, this Mister Lion would
give him such a crack on the noddle that our hero's life would fly away to
regions concerning which the less said the better.
" 'I repeat, a lion is "unclean" simply because men are afraid of it; it is a
hundred times stronger than they are, a hundred times superior. A sheep is
"clean" because it is much weaker than they and, as I said before, much more
stupid.
" 'Every being, according to its nature and the gradation of Reason attained
by its ancestors and transmitted by heredity, occupies a definite place among
beings of other forms.
'To clarify what I have just said, a good example is the difference
between the presence, already definitely crystallized, of the psyche of your
dog and your cat. You have only to pet your dog a little and get it used to
anything you please, and it will become affectionate and obedient to the point
of abasement. It will follow you around and cut every sort of caper just to
please you. You can take liberties with it, beat it, be thoroughly mean to it; it
will never turn on you, but only grovel still more at your feet.
'But try this sort of thing on your cat. Do you think it will respond to
these indignities as your dog did, and cut the same humble capers for your
amusement? Never in the



world! Even if the cat is not strong enough to retaliate at once, it will never forget how you treated it, and sooner or later will get its revenge. 'There are stones of cats that have pounced on a man while he slept and
bitten his throat, and I can well believe it, knowing what the cat's reasons
may have been No, the cat will stand up for itself, it knows its own value, it
is proud, and this is simply because it is a cat, and its nature is at that
gradation of Reason which belongs to it according to the merits of its
ancestors In any case no being, not even a man, should be angry with a cat
for this Is it the cat's fault that it is a cat, and that owing to the merits of its
ancestors its presence occupies that gradation of "self-consciousness"? A cat
must not be despised for this, nor beaten, nor humiliated, on the contrary it
should be given its due, as occupying a higher rung on the ladder of
evolution of "self-consciousness." '
"By the way, my dear Hassein, on this subject of the mutual relations of
beings, a famous former prophet from the planet 'Desagroanskrad,' the great
Arhoonilo, now the assistant to the Chief Investigator of the whole Universe
on matters of objective morality, once said 'If a being is higher than you in
Reason, you should bow before him and try to imitate him in everything, but
if he is lower than you, you should be just toward him, for you once occupied
the same place, according to the Sacred Scale of Reason of our Creator and
All-Maintainer.'
"So, my dear boy, this last conversation with that Earth friend of mine, the
priest Abdil, made such a strong impression on him that for two whole days
he did nothing but think and think In short, the result of it all was that he
began to cognize and sense almost as he should have about the custom of
'sacrificial offerings. '
"Several days after this conversation of ours, one of the



two big religious festivals in Tikliamish took place, the festival called
'Zadik'; and in the temple where he was the chief priest my friend Abdil,
instead of delivering the usual sermon at the close of the ceremony, suddenly
began speaking about 'sacrificial offerings.'
"I happened to go to the temple that day and was one of those who heard
him speak. Although the theme of this sermon was unusual for such an
occasion and such a place, it shocked no one, for he spoke better and more
beautifully than ever before. He spoke so well and sincerely, and illustrated
his theme with so many vivid and persuasive examples, that many of his
listeners began to weep.
"His words produced such a strong impression on the whole congregation
that although his sermon lasted into the next day, instead of the customary
half hour or so, nobody wished to leave; and when it was over, everyone
remained standing for a long time as if spellbound.
"In the days that followed, certain passages from his sermon began to
circulate among those who had not been there to hear it.
"It is interesting to remark that it was the custom at that time for priests to
exist solely on the offerings of their parishioners, and this priest Abdil had
been receiving from his flock all kinds of food for his ordinary existence, for
instance the roasted and boiled 'corpses' of beings of various exterior forms,
such as chickens, sheep, geese, and so on. But after this famous sermon of his
no one brought him any of these customary offerings, but only brought or sent
him fruits, flowers, all kinds of handiwork, and other such products.
"My terrestrial friend became overnight the 'fashionable priest' of
Koorkalai. And not only was the temple where he officiated always crammed
with the citizens of the town, but he was also in great demand to preach in
other temples. He delivered many sermons against sacrificial offerings, and
the



number of his admirers kept on growing, so that soon he was famous not only among the beings of the capital but throughout the whole country of Tikliamish.
"I do not know how it would all have ended had not the whole priesthoodthat is, men-beings of the same profession as my friend—become alarmed by his popularity and I begun to oppose everything he preached. Obviously his colleagues were afraid that if the custom of sacrificial offerings were to disappear, their own excellent incomes would disappear also, and their authority would soon totter and finally crumble away altogether. "Day by day the number of the priest Abdil's enemies increased, and they
spread new slanders and innuendoes about him in order to lessen his
popularity and destroy his authority.
"His colleagues began delivering sermons in their temples proving the
exact opposite of everything Abdil had said.
"At last things came to such a pass that the priesthood bribed various beings with 'hasnamussian' properties to plan and commit all sorts of outrages upon this poor Abdil. And indeed these terrestrial nullities tried several times to destroy his existence by sprinkling poison on the various edible offerings brought to him. "In spite of all this, the number of sincere admirers of his preaching grew daily. "Finally the whole corporation of the priesthood could stand it no longer and one sad day my friend was brought to trial before the ecclesiastical high court, which sat for four days. By sentence of the high court, this Earth friend of mine was irrevocably expelled from the priesthood, and at the same meeting his colleagues also organized further ways of persecuting him. "All this, of course, had a strong effect on the psyche of the ordinary beings, so that even those who had formerly



respected him the most began to avoid him and to repeat all sorts of
calumnies about him. The very ones who the day before had sent him flowers
and other offerings, those who had almost worshiped him, were soon affected
by the constant gossip and became his bitter enemies, as though he had not
only insulted them personally but had slaughtered all their near and dear ones.
"Such is the psyche of the beings of that peculiar planet. "In short, my friend's sincere wish for the good of those around him caused
him only pain and suffering. But even this would hardly have mattered, if in
a crowning act of treachery his colleagues, aided by other 'godlike' terrestrial
beings, had not brought all this to an end; that is to say, they killed him.
"This happened in the following way. My friend had no relatives at all in
the city of Koorkalai, as he was born in some distant place. And the hundreds
of servants and other terrestrial nullities who had flocked around him when
he was in a prominent position gradually left him when he lost his
importance.
"Toward the end there remained only one very aged being, who had been
with him for a long time. To tell the truth, this old man had stayed with him
only on account of the infirmities of age which, owing to abnormal being
existence, are the inevitable lot of most of your favorites—in other words,
owing to his complete uselessness for anything required in the ordinary
conditions of being-existence there. He simply had no other place to go, and
that was why he did not desert my friend, but stayed with him even after he
had lost his importance and was being persecuted.
"Well, this old man went into my friend's room one sad morning and saw that
his planetary body had been hacked to pieces. Knowing of my friendship with
him, he ran at once to tell me about it. "I have already told you that I had
begun to love the priest



Abdil as though he were one of my own kin. So when I heard about this
terrible event, there almost occurred in my presence a 'skinikoonartsino,' that
is to say, the connections between my separate being-centers were almost
shattered.
"But later that same day I became afraid that some unconscionable being
might commit further outrages on my friend's planetary body and I decided to
ward off at least that danger. So I immediately hired several suitable beings
for a large sum of money and, unbeknownst to anybody else, had his
planetary body removed and placed temporarily on my 'selchanakh,' or raft,
which was moored not far away on the Oxoseria River and which I had kept
there with the intention of returning on it to the Colhidius Sea, and to our ship
Occasion.
"This sad end of my friend Abdil's existence did not prevent his sermons and
exhortations from having a strong effect on a growing number of beings. And
indeed the quantity of sacrificial slaughterings began to diminish perceptibly
and it became evident that, even if this custom were not abolished, it would at
least be considerably mitigated. And for the time being that was enough for
me.
"As there was no reason for me to stay there any longer, I decided to
return at once to the Colhidius Sea, and then to consider what to do with the
planetary body of my friend.
"When I reached our ship Occasion I found an etherogram from Mars,
informing me of the arrival there of another party of beings from the planet
Karatas, and asking for my speedy return.
"Thanks to this etherogram a very strange idea came into my head,
namely, that instead of disposing of my friend's planetary body on the Earth, I
might take it with me and give it to the presence of the planet Mars.
"I decided to carry out this idea, for I feared that in their hatred, my
friend's enemies might make a search for his



planetary body; and if they happened to hear where it had been returned to the presence of their planet or, as your favorites say, 'buried,' they would no doubt find it and perpetrate further outrages upon it. "And so, on the ship Occasion I soon ascended from the Colhidius Sea to
the planet Mars, where the beings of our tribe, with the aid of several kind
Martians who had already learned of the events that had just taken place on
the Earth, paid due respect to the planetary body that I had brought back with
me. They buried it with the ceremonies customary on the planet Mars, and
over the burial place erected a suitable construction.
"In any case this was the first and will surely be the last 'grave,' as your favorites call it, for a being of the Earth on this at once so near yet so far and, for terrestrial beings, quite inaccessible planet Mars. "I learned afterward that this story came to the attention of the Most Great Archangel Setrenotsinarco, the All-Quarters Maintainer of that part of the Universe to which the system Ors belongs, and that he manifested his approval by giving to the appropriate being a command concerning the soul of this terrestrial friend of mine. "On the planet Mars I did indeed find awaiting me several beings of our tribe, recently arrived from the planet Karatas. Among them, by the way, was your grandmother, who, according to the indications of the chief 'zirlikner' of the planet Karatas, had been designated for me as the passive half for the continuation of my line."



CHAPTER 20
The third flight of Beelzebub to
the planet Earth
AFTER A BRIEF pause Beelzebub continued: "This time I stayed at home on the planet Mars for a very short while, only
long enough to see and talk with those who had just arrived, and to give
certain instructions of a common tribal character.
"Once these obligations were taken care of, I descended again to your
planet with the intention of pursuing my aim, that is, to uproot from those
strange three-centered beings their horrible custom, which they considered a
sacred duty, of destroying the existence of beings of other brain-systems.
"On my third descent to the planet Earth our ship Occasion did not alight
on the Colhidius Sea, now called the 'Caspian,' but on the sea known at that
period as the 'Sea of Beneficence. ' We decided to alight there because this
time I wished to go to the capital of the beings of the second group on the
continent of Ashhark, the city of 'Gob,' which was situated on the
southeastern shore of that sea.
"The city of Gob was then a large city, and was renowned over the whole
planet for its production of fine 'fabrics' and what are called 'precious
ornaments.' The city spread over both banks of the mouth of a large river,
called the 'Keria Chi,' which rose in the eastern highlands of the country and
emptied into the Sea of Beneficence. On its western side another large river,
called the 'Naria Chi,' flowed into the same sea. And it was chiefly in the
valleys of these two rivers that the beings of the second group on the
continent of Ashhark existed.
"If you like, my dear boy, I will tell you a little about the history of these
beings," Beelzebub said to Hassein.



"Yes, Grandfather, please! I shall listen to it all with great interest and
gratitude!" replied his grandson.
So Beelzebub began "A long, long time before the period of my present tale,
and even long before the second great catastrophe to that ill-fated planet,
while the continent of Atlantis was still at the height of its splendor, one of
the ordinary three-centered beings of that continent 'discovered'—as later
became clear through my investigations—that the powdered horn of a being
of a particular exterior form then called 'pirmaral' was a very effective remedy
for all sorts of 'diseases,' and this 'discovery' was afterward circulated far and
wide by various 'freaks' on your planet At the same time there was gradually
crystallized in the Reason of ordinary beings a directing factor, of course
illusory, which later contributed to the formation in the common presence of
each of your favorites, especially the contemporary ones, the 'Reason' of their
so-called 'waking existence,' and this factor is to a large extent the cause of
the frequent change in their convictions.
"Owing to this factor, crystallized in the presence of the three-brained
beings of that period, it became the custom that anyone who 'fell ill,' as they
say, of some disease or other had to be given a dose of this powdered horn to
swallow.
"You might be interested to know that pirmarals still breed on your planet,
but the contemporary beings take them merely for one of the species they call
'deer' and have no special name for them.
"Well, my boy, the beings of the continent of Atlantis destroyed so many of
these pirmarals for the sake of their horns that soon not a single one was left
there Then certain beings of that continent who had made a profession of
hunting pirmarals went to look for them on other continents and islands.



"This kind of hunting presented great difficulties, for it took many hunters
to round up and capture the pirmarals, so these professional hunters always
took their whole families along with them to help. One day several of these
families banded together and set off to hunt pirmarals on a distant continent
then called 'Iranan,' which later, after the upheavals caused by the second
catastrophe, was called the continent of 'Ashhark,' and today is known by
your favorites as 'Asia.'
"For my further tales concerning these three-brained beings who have
taken your fancy, it will be useful for you, I think, if I emphasize here that
because of various disturbances during the second terrestrial catastrophe,
certain parts of the continent of Iranan entered within the planet, while in their
place other land masses emerged and attached themselves to it, with the result
that this continent was considerably changed, becoming almost as large as the
continent of Atlantis before the catastrophe.
"Well, my boy, one day while this group of hunters and their families were
pursuing a herd of these pirmarals, they came to the shores of the water space
later called the 'Sea of Beneficence.' This sea, with its rich and fertile shores,
pleased them so greatly that they no longer wished to return to the continent
of Atlantis, and from then on they remained in that region.
"At that time this country was indeed so marvelous and so
'sooptaninalnian' for ordinary being-existence that no being in his right mind
could help liking it. Not only did great herds of the two-brained beings called
'pirmarals' exist there, but the shores of this water space situated in the middle
of that country were covered with luxuriant vegetation, including vast
numbers of fruit trees of many kinds, whose fruit then still served your
favorites as the principal product for their 'first being-food.'
"And there were also such multitudes of the one-brained



and two-brained beings called 'birds' that when flocks of them passed
overhead, the sky became, as your favorites say, 'quite dark.'
"The waters of the Sea of Beneficence so abounded with fish that you
could almost catch them with your bare hands
"As for the soil along the shores of the sea and in the valleys of the two
great rivers flowing into it, every inch was so fertile that it could be used to
grow anything you like.
"In short, the country and its climate so delighted the hunters and their
families that none of them had any desire to return to the continent of Atlantis.
So they settled there and multiplied, soon adapting themselves to the
surrounding conditions and existing, as is said, 'on a bed of roses.'
"At this place in my tale, I must tell you about an extraordinary coincidence
that had important consequences both for the first settlers of this second group
and for their descendants down to recent times.
"It seems that when the hunters from the continent of Atlantis decided to
settle by the Sea of Beneficence, there already existed on the shores of that sea
a being from their own continent who was very important at that time and who
was an 'astrosovor,' that is, a member of a section of a 'learned society,' the
like of which has never again appeared on the planet Earth and probably never
will.
"This learned society was called the 'Society of Akhldanns.'
"The circumstances that had brought this member of the Society of
Akhldanns to the shores of the Sea of Beneficence were as follows:
"Just before the second catastrophe those genuinely learned beings then
existing on the continent of Atlantis who had founded that truly great society
became aware that something very serious was about to happen on their planet



So they set themselves to observe very carefully all the natural phenomena on
their continent, but in spite of all their efforts they could not find out precisely
what was impending. Somewhat later they sent certain of their members to
other continents and islands, in the hope that by their combined observations
they might learn what the anticipated danger was.
"These members were to observe not only natural processes on the planet
Earth, but also every kind of 'celestial phenomenon.' One of these members,
the important being I just mentioned, chose the continent of Iranan for his ob
servations and, having migrated there with his servants, settled on the shores
of that water space later called the 'Sea of Beneficence.'
"One day this learned member of the Akhldanns chanced to meet some of the
hunters on the shores of this sea and, learning that they too had come from
Atlantis, he was naturally very glad and began to establish friendly relations
with them.
"Thus, shortly afterward, when the continent of Atlantis was engulfed
within the planet, this learned Akhldann, having no longer a place to return to,
remained with the hunters in that future Maralpleicie.
"Later, the group of hunters chose this learned being, as the most
intelligent, to be their chief. Still later, this member of the great Society of
Akhldanns married one of the hunters' daughters, named Rimala, thus
becoming the founder of the second group on the continent of Ashhark or, as
it is now called, 'Asia.'
"A long time passed. "In this country, generations of three-brained beings arose and disappeared
and, as everywhere else on the Earth, the general level of the psyche of this
group underwent many



changes, sometimes of course for the better, sometimes for the worse. "As their numbers grew, these beings gradually spread more and more
widely over the country, though always preferring the shores of the Sea of
Beneficence and the valleys of the two great rivers that emptied into it
"Only much later a common center of existence was formed on the
southeastern shore of the sea, and this city, named the city of 'Gob,' became
the chief place of residence for the head of this second group of beings, whom
they called a 'king ' This position of 'king' became hereditary, beginning with
the first chief they had chosen, the learned member of the Society of
Akhldanns.
"At the time to which my present tale refers, the king of the beings of this
second group was the grandson of the great-grandson of that learned being,
his name was Koniutsion.
"My later inquiry and investigation showed that this King Koniutsion had
introduced a most wise and beneficial measure in order to uproot a 'terrifying'
evil that had arisen among the beings who by the will of fate had become his
subjects.
"And he introduced this measure in the following circumstances:
"One day King Koniutsion observed that the beings of his community
were becoming less and less capable of work, while scandals, robberies, and
acts of violence were on the increase among them, as well as many other
unpleasant incidents, which had never occurred before or only in quite
exceptional cases.
"These facts surprised and grieved the king, who became very thoughtful
and resolved to get to the root of this sorry state of affairs.



"After lengthy observation he finally came to the conclusion that the cause
lay in a new habit of the beings of his community, namely, the habit of
chewing the seeds of a plant then called 'gulgulian.' This surplanetary
formation still arises on the planet Earth today, and those of your favorites
who consider themselves 'well educated' call it 'papaveroon,' but the ordinary
beings simply call it 'poppy.' As I have just said, the beings of Maralpleicie
had a passion at that time for chewing the seeds of this surplanetery for
mation, which had to be gathered only when 'ripe.'
"In the course of further observation and impartial reflection, the king
realized that these seeds contained a certain 'something' which, when
introduced into these beings, had the power to change completely, for the
time being, all the established habits of their psyche, so that they saw, under
stood, sensed, and acted quite otherwise than they were accustomed to do.
For instance, a crow would appear to them to be a peacock; a trough of
water, a sea; a harsh clatter, music; good will appeared to them as enmity,
insults as love, and so on and so forth.
"As soon as King Koniutsion became thoroughly convinced of all this, he
dispatched some of his closest and most trustworthy subjects throughout the
land to issue strict orders in his name forbidding all beings of his community
to chew these poppy seeds; he also arranged that those who disobeyed his
orders should be punished and fined.
"At first, thanks to these measures the use of these seeds appeared to
diminish in the country of Maralpleicie. Very soon, however, it was
discovered that this was not so; in reality the number of those who chewed
the seeds was even greater than before. On realizing this, the wise King Ko
niutsion decided to punish still more severely those who persisted in this
habit; at the same time he increased the surveillance over his subjects and
enforced punishment with even greater strictness. He himself began going
about every



where in the city of Gob, personally examining the guilty and meting out
punishments, both corporal and moral.
"In spite of all this the desired result was not obtained. The number of
those who chewed poppy seeds rose steadily in the city of Gob, and reports
from other territories subject to him showed a daily increase.
"It then became evident that many three-brained beings who had never
before indulged in this habit now took it up merely out of 'curiosity'—one of
the particularities of the psyche of the three-brained beings of that planet
which has taken your fancy—that is, merely to try out the effect of those
seeds whose use had been prohibited by the king and punished with such
relentless severity.
"I must emphasize here that, although this curiosity had begun to be
crystallized in the psyche of your favorites immediately after the loss of
Atlantis, it never functioned so blatantly in the beings of former epochs as it
does in the contemporary three-brained beings there, who have more of it, I
dare say, than there are hairs on a 'toosook.'
"So, my boy . . . "When the wise King Koniutsion finally became convinced that he could
not root out the passion of chewing 'gulgulian' seeds through fear of
punishment, and saw that the only result of his measures had been the death
of some of those punished, he repealed all the orders he had previously issued
and once again began to think seriously about how to find a really effective
means of destroying this evil, so lamentable for his community.
"As I learned much later thanks to an ancient surviving monument, the
great King Koniutsion then retired to his chamber and for eighteen days
neither ate nor drank, but only very seriously thought and thought.
"According to my most recent investigations, the king was particularly
anxious to find some means of uprooting this evil because by that time all the
affairs of his community



were going from bad to worse. The beings who were addicted to this passion
had almost ceased to work; the now of revenue into the communal treasury
had entirely dried up; and ruin stared the country in the face.
"Finally, the wise king decided to deal with this evil indirectly, by playing
upon the weaknesses in the psyche of his subjects. With this aim he invented
a most original 'religious doctrine,' corresponding to the psyche of the beings
of that time, and he propagated this invention of his by every means at his
disposal.
"In this religious doctrine it was held, among other things, that far from the
continent of Ashhark lay a large island on which there existed our 'Mister
God.'
"You must know that in those days not one of the ordinary beings was
aware of the existence of any cosmic concentrations other than their own
planet Earth. They were certain that the scarcely visible 'white points' far
away in space were nothing more than the pattern on the 'veil of the world,'
that is to say, of their planet; for in their notions the 'whole world' consisted,
as I have just said, of their planet alone. They also believed that this 'veil' was
supported like a 'canopy' on special 'pillars,' the bases of which rested on their
planet.
"Well, it was asserted in that ingenious doctrine of the astute King
Koniutsion that Mister God had intentionally attached to our 'souls' the organs
and limbs we now have, in order to protect us against our environment and
enable us to serve Him effectively and profitably, and not Him alone but also
the 'souls' already taken to that island of His.
"When we die, and our 'soul' is liberated from all these specially attached
parts, it becomes what in reality it should be, and is immediately taken to this
island where, in accordance with how it has existed with its organs and limbs
on our continent of Ashhark, our Mister God assigns to it an appropriate place
for its further existence.



"If the 'soul' has fulfilled its duties honestly and conscientiously, Mister
God leaves it to continue its existence on His island, but the 'soul' that here on
the continent of Ash-hark has been idle or discharged its duties indolently or
negligently, existing only for the gratification of the desires of its attached
parts, or finally, has not kept His commandments, such a soul our Mister God
sends to a smaller neighboring island for its further existence.
"Here on the continent of Ashhark exist many 'spirits' attendant upon Him,
who walk among us wearing 'caps of invisibility,' thanks to which they can
constantly watch us unnoticed and report all our doings to Mister God, or
inform Him on the 'Day of Judgment ' We can conceal nothing from them,
neither our actions nor our thoughts.
"This doctrine also said that our continent of Ashhark and all the other
continents and islands of the world were created by our Mister God only to
serve Him and the meritorious 'souls' already dwelling on His island All the
continents and islands of the world are, as it were, places of preparation and
storehouses for everything needed for this island of His.
"This island where Mister God Himself exists with the meritorious 'souls'
is called 'Paradise,' and existence there is just 'roses, roses ' All its rivers are
of milk, and their banks of honey, no one there needs to toil or labor,
everything necessary for a happy, carefree, and blissful existence is to be
found there, supplied in superabundance from our own continent and the
other continents and islands of the world This island of 'Paradise' is full of
young and lovely women from all the peoples and races of the world, and any
one of them belongs for the asking to the 'soul' that desires her.
"In certain public squares of that superb island are great heaps of jewels,
from the most brilliant diamonds to the deepest turquoises, and every 'soul'
can take anything he likes without the least hindrance In other public squares
of that beatific island are piled huge mountains of sweetmeats



prepared with essence of 'poppy' and 'hemp,' and every 'soul' may help
himself to as much as he pleases at any hour of the day or night.
"There are no diseases there, and of course none of those 'lice' or 'fleas'
that give us all no peace here and blight our whole existence.
"The other, smaller island, where for the rest of their existence our Mister
God sends the souls whose temporary physical parts have been lazy here and
have not existed according to His commandments, is called 'Hell ' All the
rivers on this island are of burning pitch, the whole atmosphere stinks like a
skunk at bay Swarms of horrible beings blow police whistles in every square,
and all the 'carpets,' 'chairs,' and 'beds' are made of fine needles, with their
points sticking out.
"One very salty biscuit is given to each 'soul' once a day, and there is not a
single drop of drinking water on the island There are also innumerable other
torments that the beings of the Earth would not wish to undergo for anything
in the world, or even to imagine.
"Well then, my boy, when I came to Maralpleicie for the first time, all the
three-brained beings of that country were followers of the 'religion' based
upon the ingenious doctrine I have just been telling you about, and this
'religion' was then in full bloom.
"The inventor of this ingenious doctrine, the wise King Koniutsion, had
undergone the sacred 'rascooarno' long before this, that is to say, he had 'died'
many years earlier But his invention, owing as always to the strangeness of
the psyche of your favorites, had taken such a strong hold that not a single
being in the whole country of Maralpleicie doubted the truth of its very
original tenets.
"From the day of my arrival in the city of Gob I began,



as usual, visiting the 'kaltaani,' by this time known as 'chaikhanas.' "It must be noted that although the custom of sacrificial offerings was also
flourishing at that period in Maralpleicie, it was not being practiced on so
large a scale as it had been in Tikliamish.
"I set about looking for a suitable being, in order to make friends with him
as I had done in the city of Koorkalai. And indeed I soon found such a friend,
but this time he was not a priest by profession.
"My new friend turned out to be the proprietor of a large 'chaikhana', and
although I came to be on very good terms with him, as they say there, I never
had that strange feeling of 'kinship' toward him that had arisen in my essence
toward the priest Abdil.
"I existed for a whole month in the city of Gob without reaching any
decision or undertaking anything practical for my aim Accompanied by
Ahoon, I simply wandered about the city visiting different 'chaikhanas,'
including the one that belonged to my new friend.
"During this time I became familiar with the manners and customs of this
second group and also with the fine points of their religion And by the end of
the month I reached the decision to attain my aim, once again, through their
religion.
"After serious pondering I resolved to add something to the religious
doctrine already existing there, and I counted on being able, like the wise
King Koniutsion, to spread this addition of mine effectively among the
beings of that country What I added was the notion that those spirits who, as
was said in that great religion, walk among us wearing 'caps of invisibility'
and watch our deeds and thoughts are none other than the beings of other
forms existing among us It is Just they who watch us and report everything to
our Mister God.



"But we men not only fail to pay them due honor and respect, but even
destroy their existence, both for our food and for sacrificial offerings.
"In my explanations I particularly emphasized that not only should we
cease destroying the existence of the beings of other forms in honor of Mister
God but, what is more, we should try to win their favor and beseech them at
least not to report to Mister God all those little evil acts that we commit
involuntarily.
"And I began to spread this addition of mine by every possible means—of
course very cautiously To start with, I did so through my new friend, the
proprietor of the 'chaikhana ' I must tell you that his 'chaikhana' was one of
the largest in the whole city of Gob, and was famous for its reddish liquid, of
which the beings of the planet Earth are very fond So it was always filled
with customers and was open day and night It had become a meeting place
not only for the inhabitants of the city itself but also for visitors from the
whole of Maralpleicie.
"I soon became quite expert at converting all these customers, some
individually others by speaking to them in groups.
"My new friend, the proprietor of the 'chaikhana,' believed so firmly in my
invention that he was beside himself with remorse He was in constant distress
and bitterly repented his former contemptuous attitude toward the beings of
other forms and his treatment of them.
"Becoming day by day a more fervent advocate of my invention, he not
only helped to spread it in his 'chaikhana,' but began of his own accord to
visit other 'chaikhanas' in the city of Gob to proclaim the !truth' that so
agitated him He held forth in the public markets and even went several times
to the outskirts of the city to visit holy places, of which there were many at
that period, established in honor or in memory of somebody or something.



"It is interesting to remark here that on the planet Earth, the stories that
give rise to the establishment of holy places usually come from certain
terrestrial beings called 'humbugs.'
"This disease of 'humbugging,' or lying, is very widespread there. On the
planet Earth people lie both consciously and unconsciously. And they lie
consciously when there is some personal material advantage to be gained; and
unconsciously when they fall ill of the disease known as 'hysteria.'
"Besides the proprietor of the 'chaikhana' there were a number of other beings
of the city of Gob who began unconsciously to help me, as they also had
become ardent supporters of my invention; and soon all the beings of that
second Asiatic group were eagerly spreading this invention of mine, and
persuading each other that it was an indubitable 'truth' that had suddenly been
revealed to them.
"The result of it all was that, in the country of Maralpleicie, not only did
sacrificial offerings diminish but the beings of other forms even began to be
treated with unprecedented attention.
"Such comical scenes were enacted there that although I myself was the
author of the invention, I found it difficult to refrain from laughter.
"We witnessed for instance farces such as these: a highly respectable and
wealthy merchant would be riding to his shop one morning on his donkey; on
the way a motley crowd of beings would pull him off his donkey and maul
him within an inch of his life for having dared to sit on it;
then, bowing low before it, the crowd would escort the donkey wherever it
chose to go.
"Or what is called a 'woodcutter' would be hauling a load of wood from
the forest to market with his oxen. He too would be dragged from his cart and
beaten, and then the crowd would very gently unyoke the oxen, and escort
them



ceremoniously wherever they wanted to go. And if all this had happened in a
part of the city where the cart might hold up traffic, the crowd would haul it to
the market themselves and leave it there to its fate.
"This invention of mine soon led to the appearance of quite new customs
in the city of Gob—for instance, that of placing troughs in the public squares
and at all the street crossings, where every morning the residents could leave
their choicest morsels of food for dogs and other stray beings; and also the
custom of going at sunrise to the Sea of Beneficence to throw in all kinds of
food for the beings called 'fish.'
"But the most peculiar of all was the custom of paying attention to the
voices of one-brained and two-brained beings of various forms. As soon as
your favorites heard the voice of a being of any other form, they would begin
praising the name of their god and invoking his blessing. It might be the
crowing of a cock, the barking of a dog, the mewing of a cat, the squealing of
an ape, no matter what ... it would always arouse them.
"It is interesting to remark here that on these occasions for some reason or
other they would raise their heads and look upward even though, according to
the teaching of their religion, their god and his assistants were supposed to
exist on the same level as themselves, and not where they directed their eyes
and prayers. It was extremely interesting to watch their faces at these
moments."
"Pardon me, Your Right Reverence," interrupted Beelzebub's devoted old
servant Ahoon, who had been listening to these tales with the greatest interest.
"Do you remember, Your Right Reverence, how often in that city of Gob we
ourselves had to flop down in the street at the cries of beings of different
forms?"
"Indeed I do remember, dear Ahoon," replied Beelzebub. "How could I
ever forget such comical impressions?



"The fact is," he continued, turning to Hassein again, "the three-brained
beings of the planet Earth are inconceivably proud and touchy. If someone
does not share their views or agree to do as they do or criticizes their
manifestations, they are very offended and their indignation knows no
bounds.
"And if one of them should happen to have some power, he would order
anyone rash enough to criticize his conduct or to behave differently from
himself to be shut up in the sort of place usually crawling with 'rats' and 'lice.'
"And if the offended one should be physically stronger, and no one were
looking—at least no important power-possessing being with whom he
happened to be on bad terms—he would simply give the offender a good
thrashing, as the Russian Sidor once thrashed his favorite goat.
"Well knowing this aspect of their strange psyche, I had no desire to
offend them and incur their wrath. Furthermore, as I was profoundly aware
that to outrage anybody's religious feeling is contrary to all morality, I tried
when existing among them always to do as they did, so as not to be con
spicuous and draw attention to myself.
"Here it will do no harm to point out that, owing to the abnormal
conditions of ordinary existence there, the only beings of that strange planet,
especially during recent centuries, who become notable and are therefore
honored by the rest, are those who manifest themselves somehow or other
more absurdly than the majority. And the more absurd their manifestations,
the more stupid, mean, and insolent the tricks they play, the more celebrated
they become, and the greater is the number of beings on their own continent,
or even on other continents, who know them personally, or at least by name.
"On the other hand, an honest being who does not behave absurdly has no
chance at all of becoming famous, or even of being noticed, however kind
and sensible he may be.



"So, my boy, when our Ahoon mischievously reminded me of our
ludicrous situation, I was speaking of the custom of attaching significance to
the voices of beings of various forms and particularly to the voice of
'donkeys,' of which for some reason or other there were a great many in the
city of Gob.
"On that planet the beings of other forms make their voices heard, each at
a definite time For instance, the cock crows just before dawn, an ape cries in
the morning when it is hungry, and so on, but donkeys bray whenever it
enters their heads to do so and, in consequence, you may hear the voice of
that silly being at any hour of the day or night.
"Well then, it became customary in the city of Gob that whenever the
sound of a donkey's bray was heard, everyone immediately had to flop down
and offer up prayers to their god and their revered idols I must add that
Nature has given the donkey a very loud voice, and its braying can be heard a
long way off.
"So, as we walked along the streets of the city and saw the citizens
flopping down at the braying of every donkey, we had to flop down likewise,
so as not to appear different from the others, and it was this ridiculous
custom, I see now, that tickled old Ahoon so much.
"Did you notice, dear Hassein, with what venomous satisfaction our old
friend reminded me, after so many centuries, of my comical situation at that
time?"
Having said this, Beelzebub, with a smile, went on with his tale.
"Needless to say, in this second center of culture on the continent of
Ashhark the destruction of beings of other forms for sacrificial offerings
entirely ceased, and if isolated instances did occur, the other beings of that
group settled accounts with the offenders without compunction.
"Having thus become convinced that I had succeeded so easily in
uprooting, for a long time to come, the custom of



sacrificial offerings among the second group of beings on the continent of
Ashhark, I decided to leave. But I had it in mind, in any event, to visit other
large centers inhabited by the beings of Maralpleicie, and I chose for this
purpose the region of the river called 'Naria Chi.'
"Soon after making this decision, I sailed with Ahoon to the mouth of that
river and began to travel up it against the current. At each of the large centers
we came to I was able to verify that there had already passed from the beings
of the city of Gob to the beings of these places the same new customs and
notions concerning the destruction of the existence of beings of other forms
for sacrificial offerings.
"We finally arrived at a small town called 'Arguenia,' which in those days
was considered the most remote point of the country of Maralpleicie. It was
inhabited by a fair number of beings of this second Asiatic group, who were
engaged chiefly in extracting from nature what is called 'turquoise.'
"In this small town of Arguenia, in accordance with my usual procedure, I
began to visit various 'chaikhanas,' pursuing there, as always, the fulfillment
of my principal aim."



CHAPTER 21
The first visit of Beelzebub to India
BEELZEBUB continued as follows: "One day while sitting in a 'chaikhana' in the small town of Arguenia I overheard a conversation among several beings seated not far from me. "They were talking about traveling by caravan to 'Pearl-land' and deciding when and how they should go. "Overhearing their conversation, I gathered that they intended to go there
to exchange their 'turquoise' for what are called 'pearls.'
"Here, by the way, let me draw your attention to the fact that in former
epochs your favorites liked, as they still do today, to wear pearls, turquoise,
and many what are called 'precious trinkets,' for the purpose, as they say, of
'adorning' their exteriors. But if you would like my opinion, they do this
simply by instinct, in order to offset their inner insignificance.
"At the period to which my present tale refers, these 'pearls' were very rare among the beings of the second Asiatic group and commanded a high price. In Pearl-land, on the contrary, they were plentiful and could be bought quite cheaply, for at that time pearls were obtained only from the water spaces surrounding that country. "The conversation of the beings sitting near me in the 'chaikhana' in the small town of Arguenia immediately interested me, as I myself had the intention of going to Pearl-land, which was the place of existence of the three-brained beings of the third group on the continent of Ashhark. And the association was at once aroused in my thoughts that it might be better to go directly to Pearl-land with the caravan of these beings than to return to the Sea of Beneficence by



the way we had come and travel from there to Pearl-land in our ship
Occasion.
"Although this journey, in those days almost impossible for the beings of
the Earth, would take a great deal of time, I reflected that the journey back to
the Sea of Beneficence, with its unforeseeable contingencies, would perhaps
take not much less time. Moreover, an association arose in my thoughts
because long before this I had heard a great deal about the peculiarities of
nature in the regions through which the proposed caravan route lay, and in
consequence a certain 'being-love of knowledge' that was already crystallized
in me, having been shocked into functioning by what I had overheard, at once
imposed on my common presence the need to experience all this myself
directly with my own organs of perception.
"That is why, my boy, I purposely went over and sat down with those
beings and joined in their discussion. As a result, Ahoon and I were included
in their caravan, and two days later we set off with them.
"We then passed through some most unusual places, unusual even for the
nature of that ill-fated planet, certain parts of which, by the way, had become
so strange only because this planet had already undergone two what are
called 'transapalnian perturbations,' almost without precedent in the Universe.
From the very first day we had to make our way through gorges overhung
with rocky 'projections' of unusual forms, containing conglomerations of all
kinds of 'intraplanetary minerals.'
"It was only after a month's travel, according to their time calculation, that
our caravan from Arguenia came to places where Nature had not completely
lost the possibility of producing surplanetary formations in the soil, and of
creating corresponding conditions for the arising and existence of various
one-brained and two-brained beings.
"After all sorts of difficulties, at last, one clear morning,



we reached a summit and suddenly saw on the horizon the outline of a large
water space, bordering the shores of that part of the continent of Ashhark then
called 'Pearl-land.'
"Four days later we arrived at the chief center of existence of the third
Asiatic group, the city then known as 'Kaiamon.' Having arranged for a place
to stay, Ahoon and I spent the first few days simply strolling about the streets
of the city, observing the specific manifestations of the beings of that third
group in the process of their ordinary existence.
"It cannot be helped, my dear Hassein! Now that I have told you the
history of the arising of the second group of beings on the continent of
Ashhark, I shall also have to tell you about the arising of the third group
"Tell me, tell me, dear beloved Grandfather!" cried Hassein eagerly. Then,
with reverence, he lifted his arms and said with great sincerity.
"May my dear and kind grandfather become worthy of perfecting himself
to the degree of Reason of the sacred Anklad!"
Saying nothing to this, Beelzebub only smiled and continued as follows:
"The history of this third group begins shortly after that period when the
families of the 'pirmaral' hunters had first come from the continent of Atlantis
to the shores of the Sea of Beneficence and, having settled there, had founded
the second group of Asiatic beings. In those remote days— infinitely remote
for your contemporary favorites—that is, not long before the second
transapalnian perturbation occurred to this ill-fated planet, certain
consequences of the properties of the 'organ kundabuffer' had begun to be
crystallized in the presences of the beings of the continent of Atlantis; and this
aroused in them the need, among other needs unbecoming to three-brained
beings, to adorn them



selves with various trinkets and to wear the famous 'talismans' they had
invented.
"And one of these trinkets, much prized then on the continent of Atlantis
as everywhere today on the Earth, was this 'pearl' we have mentioned 'Pearls'
are formed in certain one-brained beings breeding in the 'saliakooriapi' of
your planet Earth, that is, in the part called 'hentralispana,' or as your favorites
might express it, the 'blood of the planet,' which is found in the common
presence of every planet and serves the actualizing of the process of the Most
Great Common-Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, and there on your planet this part
is called 'water.'
"The one-brained beings in which 'pearls' are formed used to breed in the
'saliakooriapi,' or water spaces, surrounding the continent of Atlantis, but on
account of the great demand, so many of these 'pearl-bearing beings' were de
stroyed that soon there were none left along the shores of that continent
Thereupon, when those beings who made the aim and sense of their existence
the destruction of these one-brained beings—that is to say, who destroyed
them only to procure that part of their common presence called 'pearl' for the
gratification of their absurd egoism—found no more in the water spaces near
the continent of Atlantis, these 'professionals' began to look for them in other
water spaces, and gradually moved farther and farther away from their own
continent.
"Once during this search, their rafts were unexpectedly earned by
prolonged 'saliakooriapnian displacements' or, as they say, 'storms,' to a
region abounding in these 'pearl-bearing beings,' where conditions were
extremely favorable for their destruction.
"The waters that these destroyers happened to reach, and where these
'pearl-bearing beings' bred in large numbers, were precisely those surrounding
the country then called 'Pearl-land,' and now called 'Hindustan' or 'India. '



"For the first few days, these terrestrial professionals gave free rein to the
inclination, already inherent in their presences, wantonly to destroy these one
brained beings of their planet, but later, after they found out, also by chance,
that almost everything required for ordinary existence grew in abundance on
the neighboring land mass, they decided not to return to Atlantis but to settle
permanently in Pearl-land.
"Thereupon a few of these destroyers of 'pearl-bearing beings' sailed back
to the continent of Atlantis, and after bartering their pearls for articles still
lacking in the new place, they returned to Pearl-land, bringing with them their
families and those of their comrades who had stayed behind.
"Later on, others among those first settlers in this country, still 'new' for
the beings of that period, visited their native land from time to time to
exchange pearls for various articles they needed, and each time they brought
back with them more of their relatives and kinsmen, or simply laborers in
dispensable for their extensive activities.
"So, my boy, from then on, that part of the surface of the planet Earth
became known to all the three-brained beings there, and especially to those of
Atlantis, as the 'Land of Beneficence.'
"Thus, many beings from Atlantis were already existing on this part of the
continent of Ashhark before the second great catastrophe occurred to the
planet Earth, and when the continent of Atlantis was engulfed within your
planet many of its inhabitants who happened to be saved, chiefly those who
had relatives by blood or marriage in Pearl-land, gradually collected there
"With the 'fecundity' proper to them they multiplied steadily, and began to
spread over this part of their planet.
"At first they populated only two particular regions around the mouths of
two great rivers, which flowed from the interior of the continent of Ashhark
and emptied into



the vast water space just where many of the 'pearl-bearing beings' bred But as
their numbers continued to increase, they also began to settle in the interior of
the country, although their favorite regions were still the valleys of the two
rivers.
"Well then, my boy, when I first arrived in Pearl-land, I decided to attain my
aim as before by means of the 'havatviernoni' existing there, that is, through
their 'religion ' But it turned out that at that time the beings of this third group
of the continent of Ashhark had several peculiar 'havatviernonis,' or
'religions,' each based upon a quite independent 'religious teaching' having
nothing in common with the others.
"In view of this I began to make a serious study of these 'religious
teachings' and, having ascertained that the one founded on the teaching of a
genuine Messenger of our Common Endless Creator—afterward called Saint
Buddha —had the most followers, I devoted all my attention to its study.
"Before telling you more about the three-brained beings breeding on that part
of the surface of the planet Earth, I think it necessary to remark, however
briefly, that ever since the custom arose of having independent
'havatviernonis' or 'religions,' there have existed and still exist among your
favorites two basic kinds of 'religious teachings. '
"One kind is invented by certain three-brained beings in whom, for some
reason or other, the psychic functioning proper to a 'hasnamuss' has been
developed, and the other kind of religious teaching is founded upon detailed
instructions revealed as it were by genuine Messengers from Above, who are
indeed sent from time to time by certain of the closest assistants of our
Common Father to help the three



brained beings of your planet destroy in their presence the crystallized
consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer.
"The religion then followed by most of the beings of Pearl-land, to which I
devoted my attention, and about which I now find it necessary to tell you,
arose in the following way:
"As the three-brained beings of that third group multiplied, many of them
were formed with 'hasnamussian' properties and began spreading ideas more
maleficent than usual among the other beings around them, so that a special
psychic property began to be crystallized in the presences of most of them,
engendering a factor that greatly hindered the normal 'exchange of substances'
actualized by the Most Great Common-Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat.
"Well then, as soon as that lamentable result—again issuing from this
same planet—became known to certain Most Sacred Individuals, they
graciously vouchsafed that a corresponding Sacred Individual be sent
especially to that group of beings to regulate their being-existence in a more
or less tolerable manner, in accordance with the existence of the whole of that
solar system. The Sacred Individual who was sent to them was coated with the
planetary body of a terrestrial three-brained being and was called, as I have
said, Saint Buddha. This actualization took place several centuries before my
first visit to the country of Pearl-land.
At this point Hassein looked up at Beelzebub and said: "Dear Grandfather, more than once in your talks you have used the
expression 'hasnamuss. ' Until now I have understood, merely from the
intonation of your voice and the consonance of the word itself, that by this
expression you designated certain three-brained beings you always set apart
from others as if they deserved 'objective contempt. ' Be



kind, as always, and explain to me the real meaning of this word."
Whereupon Beelzebub, with a smile peculiar to him, replied:
"As regards the 'type' of three-brained being for whom I have adopted this
expression, I will tell you at the proper time; but meanwhile know that this
word designates the already defined common presence of any three-brained
being—whether consisting of the planetary body alone or already coated with
higher being-bodies—in whom for some reason or other data have not been
crystallized for the divine impulse of Objective Conscience."
With no further explanation of the word "hasnamuss," Beelzebub
continued:
"Well, my boy, during my detailed study of that religious teaching, I also
discovered that when this Sacred Individual had become coated with the
presence of a three-brained being of that planet, and had seriously pondered
how to fulfill the task laid upon him from Above, he decided to accomplish it
by the enlightenment of their Reason.
"Here it must be noted without fail that at that time there had already been
crystallized in the presence of Saint Buddha, as my detailed investigations
made evident, a very clear understanding that during the process of its
abnormal formation, the Reason of the beings of the planet Earth becomes
'instincto-titillarian,' that is, it functions only under the action of
corresponding shocks from without. In spite of this, Saint Buddha decided to
carry out his task by means of their 'Reason'—so peculiar for three-brained
beings—and he began informing that Reason of theirs with objective truths of
every kind.
"First of all, Saint Buddha assembled a number of the chiefs of the third
Asiatic group and spoke to them as follows:



'Beings with a presence in the image of the Creator of all things!
'My essence has been sent to you by certain Enlightened and Most
Sacred Final Results, who guide in perfect justice the actualization of
everything existing in the Universe, to serve as a helping factor for each of
you in the striving to free yourselves from the consequences of those
abnormal being-properties which, because of important common-cosmic
needs, were implanted in the presence of your ancestors and, passing by
heredity from generation to generation, have reached you also.'
"Saint Buddha spoke about this again and in a little more detail, but only to
certain beings he himself had initiated. "This time he expressed himself in the
following words:
'Beings with a presence designed to actualize the Hope of our Common Father! 'Soon after the arising of your species, there occurred in the process of
the normal existence of the whole solar system an unforeseen misfortune
which entailed serious consequences for everything existing.
'In order to avert universal disaster it was then considered necessary,
according to the calculations of certain Most High Most Sacred Individuals,
among other measures to make a change in the functioning of the common
presence of your ancestors, namely, to implant in them a certain organ with
special properties, owing to which everything external perceived by their
presence and transformed in them for their own coating would be manifested
not in accordance with reality.
'A little later, when the normal existence of your solar system had been
stabilized and there was no further need for various intentionally created
measures, our Most All-Gracious Common Father did not fail to give the
command to annul certain artificial measures, and among other things



to remove from the common presence of your ancestors the now superfluous
"organ kundabuffer," with all its special properties. And this command was
immediately carried out by the corresponding Sacred Individuals who
superintend such cosmic actualizations.
" 'After a considerable time had passed, it suddenly became clear that,
although all the properties of that organ had indeed been removed from the
presence of your ancestors by these Most Sacred Individuals, nevertheless a
certain cosmic result flowing lawfully from these properties, namely, the
"predisposition" that arises in every more or less independent cosmic presence
from the repeated action of any function, had not been foreseen and destroyed.
" 'And so it turned out that as this "predisposition" passed by heredity to
succeeding generations, the consequences of many of the properties of the
organ kundabuffer began gradually to be crystallized in their presence.
" 'As soon as this lamentable factor in the presence of the three-brained beings
breeding on the planet Earth was ascertained, a corresponding Sacred
Individual was sent here, with the all-gracious sanction of our Common
Father, so that, having been coated with a presence like your own and having
perfected himself by Objective Reason in the conditions already established
on Earth, he might indicate the way and show you how to uproot from your
presence the already crystallized consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer, as well as your inherited "predisposition" to new crystallizations.
" 'During the period when this Sacred Individual, coated with a presence
like your own and already at the age of a responsible terrestrial three-centered
being, was personally guiding the ordinary process of being-existence of your
ancestors, many of them did indeed free themselves completely from the
consequences of the properties of the organ



kundabuffer, and thereby acquired being for themselves personally or became
normal sources for the arising of a normal presence in future beings like
themselves.
" 'But even before this Sacred Individual's appearance here, owing to the
many abnormal conditions of ordinary existence created by you, the duration
of your existence had become unnaturally short, and consequently the process
of the sacred "rascooarno" had to occur very early to this Sacred Individual
also—that is to say, he too, like yourselves, had to die prematurely, without
having time to accomplish the task assigned to him. After his death,
everything gradually became as it had been before, partly due to the same
abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence and partly to that maleficent
property in your psyche called "wiseacring."
'Thanks to this property in your psyche the beings here, even of the
second generation after the contemporaries of this Sacred Individual sent from
Above, gradually began to change everything he had explained and indicated,
until ultimately the whole of his teaching was completely destroyed.
" 'Again and again the same action was taken by the Most High Common
Cosmic Final Results—and each time with the same fruitless outcome.
" 'And now, in this present period of the flow of time, when the abnormal
existence of the three-brained beings of the Earth, particularly of those on that
part of its surface called "Pearl-land," is becoming a serious hindrance to the
normal harmonious existence of the whole of this solar system, my essence is
manifested among you from Above in order that here on the spot, together
with your own essences and in the already established conditions, it may look
for some way to uproot from your common presences those consequences still
existing in you owing to the "lack of foresight on the part of certain Most
Saintly Cosmic Final Results."



"After this, by means of various talks with them, Saint Buddha first clarified
for himself and then explained to the others how the process of their existence
should be conducted, and in what order their positive part should consciously
guide the manifestations of their unconscious parts, so that the crystallized
consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, and also the
'inherited predisposition' to them, might gradually disappear from their
common presence.
"And indeed, as my detailed research made clear to me, during the period
when the inner psyche of the beings on that part of the surface of the Earth
was guided by this genuine Messenger from Above, Saint Buddha, those con
sequences so maleficent for them once more began to disappear from the
presences of many of them.
"But to the sorrow of every Individual with Pure Reason of any gradation
whatever and to the misfortune of the three-brained beings of all succeeding
generations who arise on that planet, the first descendants of the
contemporaries of this genuine Messenger from Above, Saint Buddha, fell
victim to that evil property of their psyche, namely 'wiseacring'—still one of
the chief results of the abnormally established conditions of ordinary being
existence there— and began to wiseacre about all his indications and
counsels, and this time to 'superwiseacre' so thoroughly that all that reached
the beings of the third and fourth generations who arise on that planet was
what our honorable Mullah Nasr Eddin defines by the words:
'Only information about its specific smell.' "Little by little they so completely changed these indications and counsels
of his that should their saintly author reappear there and for some reason or
other wish to learn about them, he would never even suspect that he himself
had given these indications and counsels.



"Here I cannot refrain from expressing my essence-grief at that strange
practice of your favorites, which in the course of many of their centuries has
gradually become, as it were, lawful in the process of their ordinary existence
This peculiar practice, already firmly established there, served to distort all
the true indications and exact counsels of Saint Buddha, and thus created yet
another factor for the dilution of their psyche.
"The chief characteristic of this long-standing habit is that a small,
sometimes quite trifling cause is enough to change for the worse or even
completely destroy any 'good' outer or inner tempo of ordinary existence
'good,' that is, in the objective sense of the word.
"Certain details of the arising of the trivial cause that led to the distortion
of the true explanations and indications of this genuine Messenger from
Above, Saint Buddha, may provide you with excellent material for a better
sensing and understanding of the strangeness of the psyche of those three
brained beings who have taken your fancy And so I shall speak of this at
length and explain the exact sequence in which this peculiar practice arose
and was manifested there, bringing about a certain sad misunderstanding, par
ticularly in evidence today.
"I must tell you that I cleared up this misunderstanding long after the
period to which my present tale refers, namely, during my sixth descent there,
when it became necessary, in connection with a question concerning the
saintly Ashiata Shiemash, about whom I shall soon tell you, to investigate a
certain fact about the activities of that genuine Messenger from Above, Saint
Buddha As it turned out, the source of the lamentable misunderstanding was,
unfortunately, certain authentic words spoken by Saint Buddha himself.
"One day while instructing some of his closest initiates, Saint Buddha
spoke in very precise terms about a means for the possible destruction in their
nature of the consequences



of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, transmitted to them by heredity.
"Among the things he said to them was this: " 'One of the best means of rendering ineffective the predisposition in your
nature to crystallize the consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer is "intentional suffering"; and the greatest "intentional suffering"
can be obtained in our presences by compelling ourselves to endure the
displeasing manifestations of others toward ourselves.'
"This explanation of Saint Buddha, along with other definite indications of
his, were circulated among the ordinary beings there through his closest
initiates; and after he had undergone the process of the sacred 'rascooarno,' it
began to pass from generation to generation.
"As I have already told you, my boy, from the time of the loss of Atlantis
the property called the 'psycho-organic need to wiseacre' had become fixed in
the psyche of your favorites. And so—to the misfortune of all ordinary three
centered beings of that period and. of all succeeding generations up to the
present—the beings of the second and third generations after Saint Buddha
began to wiseacre and superwiseacre about this counsel of his. As a result, the
very definite notion became fixed in their presence and also passed from
generation to generation that this 'endurance' could be produced only in
solitude.
"Here the strangeness of the psyche of your favorites showed itself, as it
still does today, in their failure to grasp the obvious fact—obvious, that is, to
any more or less sane Reason—that in advising them to practice that kind of
endurance, the divine teacher, Saint Buddha, meant of course that they should
do so while continuing to exist among beings like themselves. And he advised
this in order that, by frequently producing this sacred being-actualization
toward the displeasing manifestations of others, there might be evoked in
them what are called 'trentroodianos' or, as



they would say, the 'chemico-physical results' that engender in the presence of every three-centered being those being-data necessary for the arising of one of the three holy forces of the sacred being-Triamazikamno And in beings, this 'holy force' always becomes affirming toward all the denying properties already present in them. "Well, my boy, from the time when the mentioned definite notion had taken root, certain of your favorites deliberately withdrew themselves from the established conditions of ordinary being-existence, in the midst of which their predisposition to the crystallization of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer had become more intense in their presences Yet of course, as the divine teacher Buddha had foreseen, it was in those conditions alone that this 'endurance' of the manifestations of others displeasing to themselves could crystallize in their presence those actualizations of 'partkdolgduty' required from all three-centered beings in general, without which 'self-perfecting' is impossible. "And so, for the sake of this famous 'suffering' of theirs, many of the three-centered beings of that planet, either singly or in groups—that is, with others who thought as they did—began to withdraw from the society of their fellow beings. "They even founded special colonies for this purpose where, although existing together, they nevertheless arranged everything so as to produce this 'endurance' of theirs in solitude. "It was then that their famous 'monasteries' first came into existence, which continue down to the present day, and where certain of your favorites go, as they say, 'to save their souls. '
"Well, when I first visited Pearl-land, most of the three-brained beings were, as I said before, followers of the religion



based upon the supposedly exact counsels and indications of Saint Buddha,
and their faith in this religion was unshakable.
"At the outset of my study of the doctrinal subtleties of that religion, I was
still uncertain just how to make use of it to attain my aim But when in the
course of my investigations I happened to clarify for myself a particular
notion shared by all the followers of that religion, which again was based
upon a misunderstanding of certain words actually uttered by Saint Buddha, I
at once decided how to act through this peculiar havatviernoni, or religion, of
theirs.
"It transpired that in his explanations of cosmic truths Saint Buddha had
told them, among other things 'Each of the three-centered beings existing on
the various planets of our Great Universe, and of course on the Earth also,
must in reality be nothing other than a particle of that Most Great Greatness
which is the All-Embracing of all that exists, and the foundation of this Most
Great Greatness is there Above, the better to embrace the essence of
everything existing.
" 'This Most Great Foundation of the All-Embracing of everything existing
constantly emanates throughout the whole of the Universe, and on the planets
it coats from its particles certain three-centered beings who have attained in
their common presence the capacity to have their own functioning of the two
fundamental cosmic laws of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh and the sacred
Triamazikamno, so that these particles form a definite unit, in which alone
divine Objective Reason has the possibility of becoming concentrated and
fixed.
'And this has been foreseen and created in this manner by our Common
Creator so that when these particles of the Great All-Embracing return, now
spiritualized by divine Reason, and reblend with the Prime Source of the All
Embracing, they should compose that Whole which, in the Hope of our
Common Endless Uni-Being, may actualize



the sense and striving of everything that exists in the entire Universe.
"And it seems that Saint Buddha said to them further " 'You, three-centered
beings of the planet Earth, endowed with the possibility of acquiring your own
functioning of both fundamental sacred laws, have also the full possibility of
coating in yourselves this most sacred particle of the Great All-Embracing of
everything existing, and of perfecting it to the required degree of divine
Reason.
'And this Great All-Embracing of all things embraced is called "Holy
Prana. " '
"This precise explanation of Saint Buddha was well understood by his
contemporaries, and many of them began to strive with eagerness to absorb
and to coat in their presences the particles of this Most Great Greatness, and
afterward by this means to make manifest divine Objective Reason.
"But when the beings of the second and third generations following Saint
Buddha began wiseacring with their peculiar Reason about his explanations of
cosmic truths, they introduced for future transmission the definite notion that
this 'Mister Prana' is already in them when they first see the light of day.
"Thanks to this misunderstanding, the beings of that period and of all
subsequent generations, including the present one, have imagined that,
without fulfilling any being-partkdolgduty, they are already particles of that
Most Great Greatness, as Saint Buddha himself had so specifically described.
"So, my boy, as soon as I had realized what this misunderstanding was, and
had ascertained that the beings of Pearl-land were all, without exception,
convinced that they were already particles of 'Mister Prana' himself, I decided
to make use of this misunderstanding and to attain my aim, here also, through
their religion.



"Before saying more, I must not fail to point out that although Saint Buddha
had supposedly said that a being already has within himself at his arising a
particle of the Most Great Greatness, my detailed investigations quite clearly
showed me that he could never possibly have said that.
"And he could not have said this because, as my investigations quite
definitely showed, when he happened on one occasion to be with his devoted
disciples in the locality of 'Senkoo-ori,' what he actually said was as follows:
" 'If this most sacred Prana is crystallized in you, with the conscious or
unconscious participation of your "I," you must without fail bring the
perfecting of the individual Reason of this totality of most sacred atoms to the
required gradation, otherwise this most holy coating, changing from one
exterior coating to another, will suffer and languish eternally.
"Here it is interesting to recall that the beings of that planet were given the
same warning by another Sacred Individual, also a genuine Messenger from
Above, Saint Kirmininasha, who expressed it in these words:
" 'Blessed is he that hath a soul, blessed also is he that hath none, but grief
and sorrow are the lot of him who hath in himself only its conception. '
"So, my boy, when I had made all this clear to myself, I at once decided to
make use of this error of theirs for the accomplishment of my aim.
"Here in Pearl-land, just as in the city of Gob, I first invented an addition
to their religious teaching, and then began to spread this invention of mine by
every possible means.
"I spread the idea that the most sacred Prana, of which our divine teacher
Saint Buddha had spoken, is already present not only in us men but in all
beings that arise and exist



on our planet Earth I said that a particle of that Most Great All-Embracing, the
most sacred Prana, settles from the moment of its arising in every form of
being on every scale, whether breeding on the surface of the planet, in its
waters, or in the atmosphere.
"I regret to have to say here, my boy, that more than once I was constrained to emphasize that these words came from the lips of Saint Buddha himself. "Several beings of that country with whom I had established friendly
relations, and who were the first I persuaded to accept my invention, believed
in it immediately without question, and from then on very effectively helped
me— unconsciously of course—to spread this invention of mine Here, too,
my friends went about, zealously and passionately proving to their fellows
that this was just so and could not possibly be otherwise In short, my second
invention brought about the desired results in Pearl-land more rapidly than I
could have expected.
"Owing simply to my invention, your favorites so changed their essence
relations with beings of other forms that they not only ceased to destroy their
existence for their famous 'sacrificial offerings,' but even began very
sincerely, with the whole of their being, to regard them as beings like
themselves.
"If only they had stopped at this point, all would have been well, but here, just as in the country of Maralpleicie, they soon fell into their habit of wiseacring and began to manifest many comical aspects of their havatviernoni. "For instance, within a few of their months after I began spreading my invention, at almost every step you could see, when strolling down the street in the city of Kaiamon, beings walking on what are called 'stilts ' And they walked on stilts so as not to risk crushing some insect or other, a 'little being just like themselves,' as they now believed.



"Many were afraid to drink water that had not been freshly drawn from a
spring or stream, fearing that tiny beings might have fallen into it and that
without seeing them they would unwittingly swallow these 'poor little
creatures like themselves.' Many took the precaution of wearing what are
called 'veils' lest the 'poor little beings' existing in the air should accidentally
enter their mouths or noses And so on and so forth.
"From that time on, in the city of Kaiamon and its outskirts, and
throughout Pearl-land, societies began to spring up whose aim was to protect
'defenseless' beings of various forms, both those existing among them and
those they called 'wild.' In all these societies there were rules prohibiting not
only the destruction of these beings for sacrificial offerings, but also the use
of their planetary bodies for 'first being-food. '
"Eh-h-h-h-hkh . . . my boy! "Owning to the strangeness of their psyche, the intentional suffering and
conscious labor specially actualized for them by that Sacred Individual, Saint
Buddha, who had been coated with a planetary presence like their own, have
ever since hovered in vain over this planet, without producing any of the real
results that could have been lawfully expected; but they have engendered only
all kinds of pseudo teachings, like those existing there today bearing the
names of 'occultism,' 'theosophy,' 'spiritualism,' 'psychoanalysis,' and so on,
which, now as before, are simply means for 'obscuring' their psyche, already
obscured enough without this.
"Needless to say, of the truths indicated by Saint Buddha himself absolutely
nothing has survived and reached the beings of the present time.
"Half of one of the words he used did, however, manage to reach the
contemporary beings of that unparalleled planet. And this half word reached
them in the following way.



"Among other things, Saint Buddha explained to the beings of Pearl-land
how, and in what part of the bodies of their ancestors, the famous organ
kundabuffer had been implanted.
"He told them that the Angel Looisos had by a special means made this
organ grow at the lower extremity of that brain that Nature had placed in their
ancestors as well as in them, along the back, in what is called the 'spinal
column. '
"Saint Buddha added, as I also made clear, that, although the properties of
this organ had been entirely destroyed in their ancestors, its material formation
had remained at the lower extremity of this brain and having been transmitted
from generation to generation had also reached them.
" 'But this material formation,' he said, 'now has no significance
whatsoever and can be completely destroyed in the course of time, if your
being-existence proceeds as is becoming to three-centered beings.'
"However, when they began wiseacring and inventing all sorts of forms of
their famous 'suffering,' they also played one of their usual tricks with the
name of this organ.
"To begin with, as the root of the second half of this name happened to
coincide with a word that in the language of that time meant 'reflection,' and
as they had thought up a means for destroying this material formation
rapidly—and not in the course of time, as Saint Buddha had advised them
they also wiseacred about this word with their bob-tailed Reason, ruminating
as follows:
'Of course when this organ was in action, its name must have contained
the root of the word for "reflection," but since we are destroying even its
material basis the name should now end with a word whose root means
"former And as the word for 'former' in their language was then pronounced
'lina,' they changed the second half of this name, and instead of 'kundabuffer,'
they obtained the word 'kundalina.'



"Thus it was that half of the word 'kundabuffer' survived and, passing
down from generation to generation, finally reached your contemporary
favorites, accompanied of course by a thousand and one different explanations
Even the present-day 'learned beings' have a name made up of abstruse Latin
roots for that part of the spinal marrow Today the whole of so-called 'Hindu
philosophy' is based on this famous 'kundalina,' and around the word itself
exist thousands of occult 'sciences,' secret and revealed, which explain
absolutely nothing.
"And as for the way in which the significance of that part of the spinal
marrow is defined by contemporary terrestrial beings, learned in what are
called the 'exact sciences,' that, my dear boy, is a profound mystery.
"And it became a mystery because several centuries ago this 'definition'
suddenly, without rhyme or reason, entered the favorite mole of the famous
Scheherazade, which that incomparable Arabian fantasist chanced to have on
the right side of her adorable navel.
"And there this 'scientific explanation' has been preserved intact down to
the present day.
"When I was quite convinced that I had succeeded so easily in destroying,
perhaps for a long time, that terrible practice of sacrificial offerings among the
beings of this group, I decided to stay in Pearl-land no longer, but to return to
the Sea of Beneficence and rejoin our ship Occasion.
"We were just ready to leave when the idea suddenly occurred to me not to
return to the Sea of Beneficence by the way we had come, but by another
route quite unusual for those days.
"That is to say, I decided to return through the region later called 'Tibet. ' "



CHAPTER 22
Beelzebub in Tibet for the first time
" AS THE ROUTE proposed for the journey through Tibet was very rarely used by the three-brained beings of those days, and we could not count on joining one of their caravans, I had to organize one of my own, and I began at once to make preparations and to lay in all the supplies we would need along the way. "I procured some scores of the quadruped beings called 'horses,' 'mules,'
'donkeys,' 'Chamianian goats,' and so forth, and hired a number of your biped
favorites to look after them and to carry out the semiconscious work required
for this mode of travel.
"As soon as I had got together everything necessary, I set off, accompanied
by Ahoon.
"This time we passed through still stranger regions, where the nature of
that ill-fated planet was even more extraordinary, and we encountered, or
rather there came within the field of our vision, a much greater number of the
various one-brained and two-brained beings which are called 'wild,' and
which at that time came there from remote parts of the continent of Ashhark
in order to hunt for prey, that is, to procure their 'first being-food.'
"These wild beings were then particularly dangerous, not only for the
three-brained beings but also for the quadruped beings that your favorites,
with the cunning proper to them, had already made their slaves, compelling
them to work solely for the satisfaction of their egoistic needs. And these wild
beings were particularly dangerous because just at that period there was being
crystallized in their presences, again due to the abnormal conditions of being
existence estab



lished by the three-brained beings there, a special function about which I shall tell you at the proper time. "It was chiefly on account of these wild beings that the regions through
which our route lay were almost inaccessible to the three-brained beings of
that period It was possible for them to pass through these places only, as they
say, 'by day,' that is, when in the atmosphere of their planet the process of
Aieioiuoa takes place in the active element Okidanokh.
"They could travel by day because during this time of the 'krentonalnian'
position of their planet in relation to their sun, almost all the wild beings were
in the being-state called 'sleep,' that is, in the state in which the energy
necessary for their ordinary existence is automatically elaborated in their
presences, and this takes place in them during just this time, whereas in three
centered beings, on the contrary, energy is elaborated only when that same
sacred process is not occurring in the atmosphere, that is to say, during what
they call 'night.'
"And so, my boy, your favorites could pass through these places only by
day At night great vigilance was required and they had to erect artificial
shelters to protect themselves and their 'belongings' from the wild beings, for
during that period of the krentonalnian position of the planet Earth these wild
beings are wide awake and take their first being-food.
"And since by then they had become accustomed to using for this purpose chiefly the planetary bodies of weaker beings of other forms arising on their planet, they would prowl about at night and seize such beings in order to make use of their planetary bodies to satisfy this need. "These wild beings, particularly the smallest ones, were already perfected
to the highest degree in wiliness and cunning, of course also owing to the
abnormally established conditions of ordinary being-existence of the three
brained



beings there. So all along our route we, and especially those we had hired for
the semiconscious work, had to be extremely watchful and alert at night in
order to protect ourselves, our quadruped workers, and our supplies.
"A pack of wild beings would gather around our camp at night, having
come there to pounce on something suitable for their first being-food, they
were rather like a' mob of your favorites on the 'floor of the stock exchange,'
or at an 'election of representatives' to some society or other whose nominal
aim is the common pursuit of a means to a happy existence for all their fellow
beings, regardless of their notorious 'castes.'
"We kept huge fires burning all night to 'scare away' the wild beings, and
our biped workers, although forbidden to do so, destroyed with poisoned
'kilnapara' arrows the ones that came too near our camp Yet not a single night
passed without some of what are called 'lions,' 'tigers,' and 'hyenas' carrying
off one or more of our quadruped beings, so that their number shrank daily.
"It is true, my boy, that this way back to the Sea of Beneficence took us much
longer than the way we had come, but what we saw and heard during our
journey of the strangeness of the psyche of your favorites fully justified the
extra time spent.
"We traveled under these conditions for more than a month of their time
and finally came upon a small settlement of three-brained beings who, as we
learned, had only recently migrated there from Pearl-land The name of this
settlement was 'Sincratortsa' and later on, when the surrounding region was
populated, this place became its chief center The whole country also came to
be known by that name, though afterward the name was changed several
times, and it is now called 'Tibet. '
"As we came upon these beings just when night was fall



ing, we asked them for 'shelter ' And when they gave us permission to stay in
their settlement, we were very glad at the prospect of a night's rest, for we
were all so exhausted by the constant warfare with the wild beings that it was
imperative for us, especially for our biped workers, to spend at least one night
in peace.
"In the course of the conversation that evening, it transpired that all the
beings of this settlement belonged to a sect, well known in Pearl-land under
the name of the 'Self-Tamers,' formed by followers of that very religion
which, as I have already told you, purported to be based on the direct
instructions of Saint Buddha.
"In this connection I might mention that the beings of your planet have yet
another particularity that long ago became proper to them alone, which
consists in this, that no sooner does some new 'havatviernoni,' or 'religion,'
arise among them than its followers begin to split up into different camps,
and each of these soon forms what is called a 'sect' of its own The strangest
thing about this particularity of theirs is that those who belong to such a sect
never call themselves 'sectarians,' as the name is considered offensive, they
are called this only by those who do not belong to their sect And the
adherents of a sect are 'sectarians' for others only as long as they have no
'guns' and 'ships' at their disposal, but as soon as they get hold of enough guns
and ships, what had been a particular sectarian doctrine at once becomes the
dominant religion.
"The beings both of this settlement and of many other districts in Pearl
land had become sectarians after having broken away from the religion whose
doctrine I had studied in detail, and which later was known as 'Buddhism '
This sect of the Self-Tamers arose owing to that distorted understanding of
one of the principles of the Buddhist religion which, as I have already told
you, they called 'suffering in



solitude.' And it was in order to give themselves up to this famous 'suffering,'
without hindrance from others like themselves, that these beings with whom
we spent the night had settled so far away from their own people.
"Now, my boy, everything I learned that night and saw the next day of the
devotees of that sect made such a painful impression upon me that for many
of their 'centuries' I could never recall it without 'shuddering.' And so I should
like to tell you in some detail about what I then saw and learned.
"During our conversation that evening I learned that while still in Pearl
land, before their migration to this isolated place, the leaders of this sect had
invented a special form of 'suffering.' They had decided to withdraw to some
inaccessible place where other beings, not belonging to their sect and not
'initiated' into its 'arcana,' would be unable to prevent them from inflicting
upon themselves this particular form of 'suffering' they had invented.
"After a long search, they finally found this place that we had come upon
by chance, and saw that it was well suited to their purpose. As they were
already solidly organized and materially secure, in the face of great
difficulties they migrated with their families to this place, which was almost
inaccessible to their ordinary countrymen and which, as I have already said,
they named 'Sincratortsa.'
"At first, while they were settling down in this new place, they existed
more or less in harmony; but when they began actually putting into practice
the special form of 'suffering' they had invented, their families, and
particularly their wives, having discovered what that form of suffering really
was, rebelled and made a great outcry, which resulted in a schism.
"This schism had occurred not long before our arrival at Sincratortsa and
already small groups were beginning to



migrate to new places that they considered even more suitable for an isolated
existence.
"For a better understanding of what follows, you will need to know the
principal cause of the schism among these sectarians.
"It turned out that the leaders of the sect, while they were still in Pearl
land, had pledged themselves to withdraw completely from beings like
themselves, and to stop at nothing in order to attain liberation from the
consequences of the properties of that organ of which the divine teacher, Saint
Buddha, had spoken Their pledge committed them to exist in a certain way
until their planetary bodies were completely destroyed, in other words, until
their death, and the purpose of this special form of existence was to 'purify'
what they called their 'souls' of all the alien deposits due to that organ
kundabuffer which, as Saint Buddha had told them, their ancestors had once
possessed And having freed themselves from these consequences, they would
acquire the possibility, as the divine teacher had also said, of reblending with
the all-embracing Holy Prana.
"But when they had settled down and begun to put into practice this
special form of 'suffering,' and their wives on learning its true nature had
rebelled, many of these sectarians, under the influence of their wives,
declined to carry out the obligations they had assumed in Pearl-land, and as a
result they split up into two independent parties.
"From then on these sectarians, formerly called the 'Self-Tamers,' began to
be called by different names Those who remained faithful to the obligations
they had taken upon themselves were called 'Orthodoxhaidooraki,' while
those who had renounced certain of the obligations assumed in their native
land were called 'Katoshkihaidooraki' At the time of our arrival in
Sincratortsa, the sectarians named 'Or



thodoxhaidooraki' had established, not far from their original settlement, a
well-organized 'monastery' where their special form of suffering was in full
swing.
"The next day, on resuming our journey after a restful night, we passed very
near this monastery of the Orthodoxhaidooraki sect of the Buddhist religion.
And as it was the hour of day when we usually made a halt to feed our
quadruped workers, we asked the monks to allow us to stop for a while in the
shelter of their monastery.
"Strange and unusual as it may seem, these beings who bore the name of
'monk' did not refuse our objectively just request, but admitted us at once,
without any of the swaggering that has become proper there throughout the
centuries to monks of all doctrines. Thereupon we unexpectedly found
ourselves in the 'holy of holies' of this doctrine, just that sphere which the
beings of the planet Earth, from the very beginning, have been so ingenious in
hiding from observation. In other words, they become so skillful at wiseacring
and making a 'mystery' of something, and then so thoroughly concealing this
'mystery' by all sorts of means, that even beings with Pure Reason cannot
penetrate to the heart of it.
"The monastery of the Orthodoxhaidooraki sect of the Buddhist religion
occupied a large square surrounded by a massive wall, which protected those
within from beings of their own kind and from wild beings. In the center of
this vast walled enclosure stood a large, solidly built structure that formed the
main part of the monastery. In one half of this building the monks carried on
their ordinary being-existence; and in the other they practiced those manipula
tions that were the special feature of the belief of their sect, but which to
outsiders were 'arcana.'
"Along the inner side of the encircling wall, and built solidly into the wall
itself, was a row of small cell-like com



partments, set close together And it was precisely in the nature of these cell
like structures that lay the difference between this monastery and monasteries
in general on the planet Earth.
"These sentry-box structures were entirely walled in on all sides, except
for a small opening near the bottom, through which, with great difficulty, a
hand could be thrust It was within these 'cells' that the 'deserving' members of
the sect were to be perpetually immured, and there they were to occupy
themselves with certain manipulations of what they call their 'emotions' and
'thoughts' until the total destruction of their planetary existence And it was
when the wives of these sectarians known as 'Self-Tamers' found out about all
this that they raised their great outcry.
"In the religious teaching of this sect there was a full explanation of just
what manipulations had to be practiced on oneself, and for how long, in order
ultimately to merit being immured in one of these 'cells,' there to receive once
every twenty-four hours a piece of bread and a small jug of water.
"When we were admitted within the walls of that terrible monastery, every
one of these monstrous 'cells' was occupied, and the care of the immured, that
is, giving them once every twenty-four hours through the tiny opening a piece
of bread and a small jug of water, was undertaken with great reverence by
other sectarians, themselves candidates for immurement, who while awaiting
their turn existed in the large building in the center of the monastery square.
"Your immured favorites did indeed remain in those monstrous sepulchers
until their motionless and half-starved existence, so full of deprivation, came
to an end.
"As soon as the companions of the immured learned that one of them had
ceased to exist, his planetary body was removed from the improvised
sepulcher and at once, in place of the being who had thus destroyed himself,
another unfor



tunate fanatic of that maleficent religious teaching was walled up. And the
ranks of these fanatical monks were always being filled with other members
of that peculiar sect constantly coming from Pearl-land.
"In Pearl-land itself all the adherents of that sect already knew of the
existence of this specially convenient place for accomplishing the 'crowning
act' of their religious doctrine, which was supposedly based on the exact
instructions of Saint Buddha; and in every large center they even had what are
called 'agents' to help them get there.
"Having rested and fed our biped and quadruped workers, we left behind
us that melancholy place of sacrifice to the wretched organ which, according
to the ruminations of certain Most High Cosmic Individuals, for some reason
or other, had to be implanted in the presence of the former three-brained
beings of that ill-fated planet.
"Eh-h-h-h-kh . . . my boy," sighed Beelzebub, "as you can imagine, it was
scarcely with agreeable sensations or happy reflections that we departed from
that place.
"Continuing our route toward the Sea of Beneficence, we again passed
through a region having high projections of many different forms, with
conglomerations of intraplanetary minerals that had erupted to the surface
from great depths.
"Here I must say something about an exceedingly strange fact I observed
concerning that part of the surface of your planet. The first time I passed
through this region, now called 'Tibet,' its peaks were, it is true, unusually far
above the surface of the Earth, but did not differ particularly from similar
elevations on other continents, or on the continent of Ashhark, or Asia, of
which Tibet is a part. But during my sixth and last personal sojourn on the
planet Earth, when my way took me once more through those memorable re
gions, I observed that in no more than a few score of their



centuries the whole of this region had projected so far above the rest of the planet that no heights on any of the other continents could even be compared with it "For instance, the principal chain of peaks in the region we were passing
through, which the beings there call a 'mountain range,' had in the interval
projected so far upward that some of its peaks are to this day the loftiest of all
the abnormal projections of that 'vainly long-suffering planet And I dare say
that if you climbed one you might perhaps be able, with the aid of a
'teskooano,' to 'distinguish clearly' the opposite side of this peculiar planet
"When I first observed that strange phenomenon taking place on your highly original planet, I at once thought that it very likely contained the germ for the arising of some future misfortune on a great cosmic scale Later, when I made a statistical study of that abnormal phenomenon, my first apprehension grew all the more And it grew all the more because in one section of my statistics it was shown that the height of the mountain chain increased from 'decade to decade ' The same section also showed when and how terrestrial 'planetary tremors' or, as your favorites call them, 'earthquakes,' occur as a result of the excessive height of those Tibetan peaks. "Although planetary tremors, or earthquakes, are often provoked in that planet of yours by other intraplanetary disharmonies resulting from the two great transapalnian perturbations, whose causes I will some day explain to you, nevertheless most of the planetary tremors there, especially in recent centuries, have taken place solely on account of those excessive elevations And this is because, due to these excessive elevations, equally disproportionate projections have arisen in the presence of the atmosphere of that planet, in other words, what is called the 'blastegoklornian sphere' of the atmosphere of the Earth has acquired, and in certain



places continues to acquire, a materialized presence that projects too far to
permit the 'reciprocal blending of the results' of all the planets of that system
Thus, during the movement of the Earth, in the course of the process known as
the 'common-system harmony,' its atmosphere 'hooks on,' as it were, at certain
times to the atmospheres of other planets or comets of that system And owing
to these 'hookings-on,' 'planetary tremors' or 'quakes' occur in corresponding
places in the common presence of your planet.
"I must also explain to you that the region of the common presence of the
planet where these 'tremors' occur depends upon the position occupied by the
planet itself in the process of the 'common-system harmonious movement' in
relation to other concentrations of the same system.
"Be that as it may, if this abnormal growth of the Tibetan mountains
continues, sooner or later a catastrophe on a general cosmic scale is inevitable.
However, if this menace I perceive becomes evident, the Most High, Most
Sacred Cosmic Individuals will no doubt take the proper measures at the
proper time. "
"Please, please, Your Right Reverence!" interrupted Ahoon, and he rattled
off the following: "Allow me to report to Your Right Reverence some
information I happened to pick up about the growth of those Tibetan
mountains you have deigned to mention Just before our flight from the planet
Karatas," continued Ahoon, "I had the pleasure of meeting the Archangel
Vilooar, the governor of our solar system, and His Magnificence
condescended to recognize me and to speak with me.
"Perhaps Your Right Reverence remembers that while we were existing on
the planet Zernakoor, His Magnificence the Archangel Vilooar was still an
ordinary angel, and often used to drop in to see us.
"So, during our conversation when His Magnificence heard me mention
the name of the solar system where we



had been exiled, he told me that at the last, most high, most sacred reception
of finally reintegrated Cosmic Results, a certain Individual, Saint Lama, had
had the privilege, in the presence of all the Sacred Individuals, of personally
presenting at the feet of our Endless Uni-Being a petition regarding the
abnormal growth of some of the elevations of a planet belonging, apparently,
to that solar system And our All-Gracious Endlessness, granting his request,
immediately commanded that the Archangel Looisos be sent to that solar
system where, as one already familiar with it, he might clarify on the spot the
causes of these projections and take appropriate measures. That is why His
Conformity the Archangel Looisos is just now hurriedly winding up his
current affairs in order to set off for that planet.
"Good, good, dear Ahoon," commented Beelzebub, and he added "Thank
you for this information Glory be to our Creator' What you have just said will
undoubtedly help to destroy the anxiety that arose in my presence when I first
noticed the abnormal growth of those Tibetan mountains, namely, my anxiety
that the precious memory of our wisest of the wise, the infinitely revered
Mullah Nasr Eddin, might completely disappear from the Universe. "
Having said this, and allowing his face to assume its customary
expression, Beelzebub went on:
"We continued our journey through the region now called 'Tibet,'
encountering hardships of every kind, and we finally came to the source of
the river named 'Keria Chi ' A few days later, sailing down the river to the Sea
of Beneficence, we regained our ship Occasion.
"After this third descent of mine to the planet Earth I did not go there again in
person for a considerable period, nevertheless from time to time I observed
these favorites of yours attentively through my big teskooano.
"And I did not go there for a long time for the following



reason: soon after returning to Mars, I became interested in an enterprise that
the Martian three-brained beings were just then carrying out on the surface of
their planet.
"To understand what this undertaking was that I became interested in, you
must know that the planet Mars is for the system Ors, to which it belongs, a
'mdnel-haootian link' in the transformation of cosmic substances;
consequently it has a 'keskestasantnian firm surface,' that is to say, one half of
its surface consists of land presence and the other of 'saliakooriapnian' masses
or, as your favorites would say, one half of it is land in one continuous
continent, and the other half is covered with water.
"So, my boy, as the three-brained beings of the planet Mars use only
'prosphora' or, as your favorites call it, 'bread,' for their first being-food, they
always sow 'wheat' on the land half of their planet. But since the wheat
derived the moisture it needed for the 'evolving djartklom' only from what is
called 'dew,' the yield from one grain of wheat was only a seventh part of the
total process of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, that is to say, the entire yield
was only one-seventh.
"As this amount of wheat was insufficient for their needs, and in order to
get more they would have to utilize the planetary saliakooriap, the three
centered beings there had been talking ever since our arrival of bringing the
necessary quantity of saliakooriap from the opposite side of the planet to the
side where their being-existence proceeded.
"Several of their years later, they finally decided the question and made the
necessary preparations, and just before I returned from the planet Earth they
set to work digging special 'canals' for conducting the saliakooriap.
"This undertaking, my boy, was extremely complicated, and to carry it out
the beings of the planet Mars were constantly inventing all sorts of 'machines'
and 'appliances,' among which were many original and ingenious ones, and



as I was always interested in any new invention, I was very much taken by this work. "By the courtesy of those kind Martians I spent nearly all my time at these
works, and that is why during this period I very seldom descended to the
other planets of that solar system.
"Occasionally, however, for a rest, I flew to the planet Saturn to visit
Gornahoor Harharkh, who meanwhile had become my real essence-friend,
and to whom I am indebted for such a marvel as my big teskooano which, as
I have already told you, increases the visibility of remote concentrations 7,
000, 285 times."



CHAPTER 23
The fourth personal sojourn of Beelzebub on
the planet Earth
BEELZEBUB continued thus: "I descended for the fourth time to that planet Earth at the request of my essence-friend Gornahoor Harharkh.
"First of all I must tell you that when I had become friendly with this
Gornahoor Harharkh, I would always, during our 'exchanges of subjective
opinion,' share with him my impressions about the strange psyche of the
three-centered beings of that planet of yours The result of these conversations
was that he too became so interested in your favorites that he even very
seriously asked me to keep him informed, if only in a general way, about my
observations of them; and thereafter I sent him, just as I did to your uncle
Tooilan, copies of all my notes on the particularities of their psyche.
"And how Gornahoor Harharkh came to be the cause of this descent of
mine occurred in the following way:
"As I have just told you, after my third descent to your planet, I
occasionally, for a rest, ascended to the planet Saturn to see my friend During
these visits I became convinced of his great learning, and one day the idea
came to me to invite him to descend to the planet Mars on our ship Occasion,
so that there on the spot he might give me the benefit of his knowledge
concerning the details of setting up my observatory, which was just then
being completed.
"Here let me emphasize that if this observatory later became famous, and
was in fact the best of all the installations of its kind in the whole Universe, I
am indebted chiefly to the learning of this essence-friend of mine.
"Well then, when I mentioned this to Gornahoor Harharkh,



without thinking long he agreed, and at once we began considering
how to carry out our intention The problem was that the route from the planet
Saturn to the planet Mars passed through cosmic spheres that did not
correspond to the presence of Gornahoor Harharkh, a being who had as yet
only the possibilities for an ordinary planetary existence.
"The result of our deliberations was that on the following day his chief
assistant began, under his direction, to arrange a special compartment in our
ship Occasion, and to equip it with every sort of apparatus for elaborating the
substances that make up the atmosphere of the planet Saturn, to which the
existence of Gornahoor Harharkh was adapted by Nature.
"One 'khrkh-khr-khroo' later, when all these preparations had been
completed, we set out on our journey in the direction of the planet Mars,
where we arrived safely at my house And there on Mars, which has almost the
same atmosphere as the planet Saturn, my essence-friend very soon became
acclimatized and began to exist almost as though on his own planet.
"It was during his stay on Mars that he devised the 'teskooano,' or
'telescope,' thanks to which my observatory became so famous throughout the
whole Universe The teskooano he constructed is indeed a marvel of being
Reason, for, as I told you, it increases the visibility of remote cosmic
concentrations 7, 000, 285 times, both during certain processes taking place in
cosmic substances in the atmospheres surrounding almost all cosmic
concentrations and during certain processes which the cosmic 'ethernokrilno'
undergoes in interspatial spheres.
"With this teskooano I was sometimes able to observe from my house on
Mars almost everything taking place on those parts of the surface of other
planets of that solar system which, during the process of the 'general system
movement,' were at that moment within the field of vision of my observatory.



"Well, my dear boy, one day while Gornahoor Harharkh was staying with
me as my guest and we were observing together the existence of those
favorites of yours, we happened to notice a fact, which became the subject of
a very serious exchange of opinions between us about the three-centered
beings of your peculiar planet.
"The result of this exchange was that I undertook to descend to the surface
of that planet and to bring back to the planet Saturn a number of the beings
your favorites call 'apes,' in order to carry out certain experiments with them
and elucidate the fact that had astonished us."
At this point in his narrative, Beelzebub was brought a "leitoochanbros,"
that is, a sort of metal plate on which is recorded the text of an etherogram
received from somewhere or other, the addressee having only to hold the plate
to his organ of auditory perception to hear everything communicated in it.
Having listened to the contents of the leitoochanbros, Beelzebub turned to
his grandson and said:
"You see, my boy, what coincidences occur in our Great Universe This
etherogram refers to your favorites in connection with the 'ape-beings' I just
mentioned It was sent to me from Mars and informs me, among other things,
that the three-centered beings of the planet Earth are once more troubled by
the 'ape question. '
"I must first tell you that on account of their abnormal being-existence,
there was long ago crystallized and there is periodically intensified in the
presence of those peculiar three-brained beings arising and existing on the
planet Earth a strange factor, producing from time to time a 'crescendo
impulse,' under the action of which they wish to find out at any cost whether
they have descended from these apes or the apes have descended from them



"Judging from the etherogram, this time the question is agitating chiefly the biped beings who breed on the continent called 'America. ' "Although this question always troubles them somewhat, every once in a while it becomes for a long time, as they express it, the 'burning question of the day. '
"I remember very well that this 'agitation of mind' over the origin of the apes occurred among them for the first time when their 'center of culture,' as they also like to express it, was the country of Tikliamish The starting point of this 'agitation of mind' was the wiseacring of a certain 'learned being of new formation' named Menitkel. "This Menitkel became a learned being because, in the first place, his childless aunt was an excellent 'matchmaker,' and mixed a great deal with 'power-possessing beings', and because, in the second place, at the age when he was on the threshold of being a responsible being he was given as a birthday present a book entitled Manual of Bon Ton and Love-Letter Writing As he was financially secure and therefore quite free, thanks to an inheritance from his uncle, a former pawnbroker, he compiled, out of boredom, a massive and erudite work about the origin of these apes, in which he 'cooked up' an elaborate theory supported by all kinds of 'logical proof,' but of course such 'logical proof as can be conceived and crystallized only in the Reason of those freaks who have taken your fancy. "This Menitkel then 'proved' by his theory that their 'fellow countrymen,' the apes, were descended from none other than people who had, as they say, 'gone wild ' The other terrestrial beings of that period, as had already become proper to them, believed implicitly this Auntie's darling, without any 'essencecriticism' whatsoever, and from that time on this question, agitating the strange 'Reason' of your favorites, became the subject of disputes and fantasies, right



up until what is called the seventh 'great planetary process of reciprocal
destruction.'
"Thanks to this maleficent idea there was fixed in the instincts of most of
the unfortunates of that period another abnormal so-called 'dictatorial factor,'
which began to engender in their common presence the false feeling that these
ape-beings were sacred. And this factor, which engendered such a sacrilegious
impulse, passed by heredity from generation to generation and reached the
instincts of many beings even of the present time.
"As for the false notion cooked up by that 'pawnshop progeny,' it held its
ground for nearly two of their centuries and became an integral part of the
'Reason' of most of them. But due to various events growing out of the
seventh planetary process of reciprocal destruction, which lasted nearly half a
century, it gradually faded away and completely disappeared from their
common presence.
"But when their so-called 'cultured existence' became concentrated on the
continent of 'Europe,' and when the time again came around for that peculiar
disease known as 'wiseacring' to manifest itself with maximum intensity—for
this disease, by the way, had long before become subject to the fundamental
cosmic law of Heptaparaparshinokh, according to which its intensity had to
fluctuate with a certain periodicity—then, to the grief of three-brained beings
of the whole Universe, that 'ape question,' or 'who is descended from whom,'
once more arose and having become crystallized again became part of the
abnormal 'Reason' of your favorites.
"In this instance also, the 'ape question' arose from the stimulus given by a
learned being, of course again a 'great' one, but of an altogether 'new
formation,' by the name of Darwin. This 'great' scientist, basing his theory on
that same logic of theirs, set about 'proving' exactly the opposite of what
Menitkel had said, that is, he 'proved' that it was they



themselves who were descended from these Mister Apes. "As for the objective reality of either of the theories of these 'great' terrestrial learned beings, I am reminded of one of the wise sayings of our esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin: " 'Luck smiled on them both, for they both managed to find the authentic godmother of the incomparable Scheherazade on an old dunghill ' "In any case, bear in mind that for many centuries this question, among others just as ephemeral, has provided material for the kind of thinking your favorites consider the 'highest manifestation of Reason.' "In my opinion your favorites could get a correct answer to this question
that always agitates them of how the apes arose, if only they really knew how
to apply another of the maxims of our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin, who often
used to say:
'The cause of every misunderstanding must be sought in woman. ' "If they had made use of this wise maxim to resolve their enigmatic question perhaps they would have finally discovered the origin of these fellow countrymen of theirs.
"As the subject of the genealogy of these apes is indeed exceedingly complicated and unusual, I shall inform your Reason about it from every possible aspect. "The fact is that neither are your favorites descended from apes nor are apes descended from them, but the cause of the arising of these apes is in this case—as in every other misunderstanding there—their women. "First of all I must tell you that none of those terrestrial ape-beings now arising there in various exterior forms ever existed before the second 'transapalnian perturbation', it was only after this disaster that the genealogy of their species began.
"The cause of the arising of these 'misconceived' beings



—as well as that of all events more or less serious in the objective sense that
occur on the surface of that ill-fated planet—stemmed from two sources
totally independent of each other.
"The first, as always, was the same lack of foresight on the part of certain
Most High, Most Saintly Cosmic Individuals, and the second was, once again,
those abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence established by your
favorites themselves.
"The point is that during the second transapalnian perturbation, besides the
chief continent of Atlantis many other large and small land masses entered
within the planet, and new land masses appeared in their place These
displacements of various parts of the common presence of this unfortunate
planet lasted several of their days, accompanied by frequent planetary tremors
and manifestations that could not fail to evoke terror in the consciousness and
feelings of beings of every kind.
"During that period many of your three-brained favorites who, together
with one-brained and two-brained beings of other forms, had chanced to
survive unexpectedly found themselves upon other newly formed land masses
in places that were entirely unfamiliar to them It was just then that many of
these strange 'keschapmartnian' three-brained beings of active and passive sex
or, as they say, 'men' and 'women,' were compelled for a number of their years
to exist apart, that is to say, without the opposite sex.
"Before continuing to relate how all this occurred, I must tell you in a little
more detail about that sacred substance which is the final result of the
evolving transformations of every kind of being-food and is formed in the
presence of every being without distinction of 'brain system ' This sacred
substance, elaborated in the presence of beings of every



kind, is almost everywhere called 'exioëhary,' but your favorites on the planet
Earth call it 'sperm. '
"Through the all-gracious foresight and command of our Common Father
Creator and according to the actualization of Great Nature, this sacred
substance arises in the presence of all beings, without distinction of brain
system or exterior coating, in order that by its means they may consciously or
automatically fulfill that part of their being-duty which consists in the
continuation of their species But in the presence of three-brained beings it
also arises in order that they may consciously transform it for coating their
higher being-bodies for their own being.
"Before the second transapalnian perturbation there, which the
contemporary three-brained beings refer to as the 'loss of the continent of
Atlantis,' in the period when various consequences of the properties of the
organ kundabuffer had already begun to be crystallized in their presence, a
being-impulse was gradually formed in them which later became
predominant.
"This impulse is now called 'pleasure', and in order to satisfy it they were
already beginning to exist in a manner unbecoming to three-centered beings,
that is to say, most of them gradually began to remove this sacred being
substance from themselves for the satisfaction of this impulse alone.
"Well, my boy, from then on most of the three-brained beings of the planet
Earth were not content to carry out the process of the removal of this
substance, which is continuously elaborated in them, only at those periods
normally established by Great Nature for beings in accordance with their
organization, for the purpose of the continuation of their species Owing to
this, and also to the fact that most of them had ceased to utilize this substance
consciously for coating their higher being-bodies, it came about that when



they did not remove it from themselves in ways that by then had become
mechanical, they naturally experienced a sensation called 'sirklinimana,' a
state they describe as 'feeling out of sorts,' and which is invariably
accompanied by what is called 'mechanical suffering.'
"Remind me at some opportune moment about those periods fixed by
Nature for the normal process of the utilization of the exioëhary by beings of
different brain-systems for the continuation of their species, and I shall
explain this to you in detail.
"Well then, they like ourselves are only 'keschapmartnian' beings, and
when this sacred substance, continuously and inevitably formed in them, is
utilized normally for the continuation of their species by means of the sacred
process 'elmooarno,' its removal from their presences must be accomplished
exclusively with the opposite sex. But these three-brained beings who by
chance had escaped disaster were no longer in the habit of utilizing this
substance for coating their higher being-bodies and, as they were already
existing in a manner unbecoming to three-brained beings, when they were
obliged to exist for several of their years without beings of the opposite sex,
they turned to various antinatural means for the removal from themselves of
this sacred substance, exioëhary.
"The beings of the male sex had recourse to the antinatural means called
'moordoorten' and 'androperasty' or, as the contemporary beings would say,
'onanism' and 'pederasty,' and these antinatural means fully satisfied them.
"But for the three-brained beings of the 'passive sex' or, as they call them,
'women,' these antinatural means were not sufficiently satisfying, and so the
poor 'women-orphans' of that time, already more cunning and inventive than
the men, began to seek out beings of other forms and accustom them to be
their 'partners.' Well then, it was after these 'partnerships' that there began to
appear in our Great Uni



verse those species of beings which, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin would say, are 'neither fish nor fowl.'
"As regards the possibility of this abnormal blending of two different kinds of
exioëhary for the conception and formation of a new planetary body of a
being, it is necessary to give you the following explanation:
"On the planet Earth, as on other planets of our Universe where
'keschapmartnian' beings breed and exist—that is, three-brained beings in
whom the formation of the sacred exioëhary for the creation of a new being
must take place exclusively in the presences of two beings of distinct, in
dependent sexes—the fundamental difference between the sacred exioëhary
formed in the presences of beings of opposite sexes, that is, in men and
women, consists in this, that in the exioëhary formed in the presences of
beings of the male sex, the localized 'holy affirming' or 'positive' force of the
sacred Triamazikamno participates, while in the exioëhary formed in beings
of the female sex there participates the localized 'holy denying' or 'negative'
force of the same sacred law.
"Thanks to the all-gracious foresight and command of our Father of
everything existing in the Universe, and in accordance with the actualizing
power of Great Mother Nature, in certain surrounding conditions and with the
participation of the third separately localized holy force of the sacred
Triamazikamno, namely, with the 'holy reconciling' force, the blending of the
exioëhary formed in two separate beings of distinct, independent sexes during
the process of the sacred 'elmooarno' taking place between them brings about
the arising of a new being.
"In the case I was speaking of, the abnormal blending of two heterogeneous kinds of exioëhary was possible only by virtue of a certain cosmic law known as the 'affinity of the numbers of the totality of vibrations,' which began to act



owing to the second transapalnian perturbation on this ill-fated planet, and
which then still continued to act on its common presence.
"Concerning this cosmic law, it is important to tell you that it arose and
began to exist in the Universe after the fundamental sacred law of
Triamazikamno had been modified by our Creator in order to render the
Heropass harmless, and after its holy parts, until then entirely independent,
had become dependent upon forces from outside. But, my boy, you will
understand this cosmic law in all its aspects only when I shall explain in
detail, as I have promised you, all the fundamental laws of world-creation and
world-existence.
"Meanwhile, you should know that on normally existing planets anywhere
in our Great Universe the exioëhary formed in the presence of a three-brained
being having organs of perception and transformation for localizing the 'holy
affirming' force of the sacred Triamazikamno, in other words, the exioëhary
formed in a three-brained keschapmartnian being of the 'male' sex, can never
be blended— owing to that same law—with the exioëhary formed in the
presence of a two-brained keschapmartnian being of the opposite sex.
"On the other hand, when a special combination of cosmic forces occurs
and this same law of the 'affinity of the numbers of the totality of vibrations'
begins to act, the exioëhary formed in a three-brained keschapmartnian being
of the 'female' sex can sometimes, in certain surrounding conditions, blend
quite well with the exioëhary formed in two-brained keschapmartnian beings
of the male sex, but only as the active factor in the actualizing process of the
fundamental sacred Triamazikamno.
"In short, during those terrible years on that planet of yours, a phenomenon
very rare in the Universe appeared, that is,



a blending of the exioëhary of two keschapmartnian beings of different brain
systems and of opposite sexes, and the result was the arising of the ancestors
of these terrestrial 'misconceived' beings now called 'apes,' who give your fa
vorites no peace, and from time to time so agitate their strange Reason.
"But when this terrible period was over, a relatively normal process of
ordinary existence was reestablished on your planet, and your favorites of
different sexes again began to find each other and exist together, and
thereafter those 'ape-beings' actualized the continuation of their species among
themselves.
"And this continuation of their species was possible because the conception
for the arising of the first of these abnormal beings had taken place according
to the same external conditions that in general determine the presences of
future keschapmartnian beings of active or passive sex.
"The most interesting result of this highly abnormal manifestation of the
three-brained beings of your planet is that there now exist a great many
species of the descendants of these ape-beings, differing in exterior form, and
each of these different species bears a striking resemblance to some form of
two-brained quadruped being still in existence there.
"This came about because the blending of the exioëhary of the
keschapmartnian three-brained beings of the female sex, which brought about
the arising of the ancestors of those apes, proceeded with the active exioëhary
of the various species of quadruped beings that exist there even until today.
"Indeed, my boy, during my last personal stay on the planet Earth, when I
happened in the course of my travels to come across the various species of
apes and, in accordance with a habit that has become second nature, I
observed them, I ascertained definitely that the whole of their outer func



tioning and the so-called 'automatic postures' of each 'species' of these
contemporary apes are exactly like those in the common presence of certain
normally arisen quadruped beings there, and their 'facial features' are even
exactly the same as those of particular quadrupeds As for the 'psychic
features' of all the different species of these apes, they are absolutely
identical, even down to minute details, with those of the psyche of the three
brained beings of the 'female sex' there. "
At this point in his tales Beelzebub became silent. After a long pause he
looked at his favorite Hassein with a smile that clearly expressed a double
meaning. Then, still smiling, he said:
"The text of the etherogram I have just received also indicates that this
time, in order to settle once and for all who is descended from whom—they
from the apes or the apes from them—these freaks, your favorites, have
decided to carry out 'scientific experiments', and several of them have already
left for the continent of Africa, where many of these apes breed, with the
object of bringing back the number required for these 'scientific
investigations' of theirs.
"To Judge by this etherogram, the beings of the planet Earth who have taken your fancy are once again up to their usual 'tricks. ' "From all I have learned about them during my observations, I foresee that
this 'scientific experiment' will unquestionably arouse the serious interest of
the rest of your favorites, and will for a time serve their strange Reason as
material for endless discussion and argument. And all this will be quite in the
order of things there.
"Concerning the 'scientific experiment' itself which they propose to carry
out with the apes brought from Africa, I can say in advance with certainty
that, at any rate, the first part of it will succeed with flying colors



"And it will succeed because the apes themselves, issuing from what is
called a 'titillarian result,' are by nature very fond of occupying themselves
with titillation, and before the day is out will no doubt play their part and
enthusiastically assist your favorites in this 'scientific experiment.'
"As for the beings who propose to carry out this experiment, and as for any
benefit to be derived from it by the other three-brained beings there, you can
get a good idea of the whole thing if you remember the profoundly wise
saying of our honorable Mullah Nasr Eddin 'Happy is the father whose son is
busy even with murder and robbery, for then he will have no time to teach
him titillation.
"It seems, my boy, that I have not yet told you why and by whom, ever since I
left the solar system Ors, I have been kept informed by etherogram of the
most important events taking place on its various planets, and also of course
on your planet Earth.
"You remember that my first descent in person to the surface of that planet
of yours was made on account of one of the young beings of our tribe, who
afterward did not wish to stay there any longer but returned with us to the
planet Mars, where he later became an excellent governor of the beings of our
tribe dwelling on that planet, and eventually of all the beings of our tribe who,
for one reason or another, still dwell on certain planets of the system Ors.
"Well then, my boy, when I left that solar system, I made him a gift of my
famous observatory with everything in it, and in gratitude for this he promised
to report to me once a year, according to the time calculation of the planet
Mars, all the important events occurring on the planets of that system And so
he keeps me accurately informed of the most important events on all the
planets on which there is a being-existence, and, knowing my great interest in
the three-brained beings breeding on the planet Earth, he does his



best, as is clearly evident, to send me information concerning all their
manifestations, thus keeping me constantly in touch with the whole process of
ordinary existence of these three-brained beings, although I am now
inaccessibly remote, even for their featherweight thoughts.
"This governor of our beings gathers all his information about the three
brained beings of the planet Earth either from his own observations through
the great teskooano I left him, or from reports communicated to him by those
three beings of our tribe who chose to remain forever on the planet Earth, all
three of whom at the present time on the continent of Europe have substantial
enterprises of their own—indispensable for everyone existing there under the
prevailing conditions.
"One of them has an 'undertaker's business' in one of the large cities, the
second, in another large city, runs a 'bureau for marriage and divorce', and the
third is the proprietor of a network of agencies founded in various cities for
what is called 'currency exchange. '
"However, my boy, owing to this etherogram, I have wandered a long way
from my original tale. Let us go back to our former theme.
"Well then, on this fourth flight of mine to the planet Earth our ship
Occasion alighted on the sea called the 'Red Sea ' And we alighted on this sea
because it washed the eastern shores of the continent of Grabontzi, now called
'Africa,' where I wished to go, and where the ape-beings I needed then bred in
greater numbers than on any of the other land masses on the surface of your
planet, and also because this sea was particularly convenient for mooring our
ship Occasion, but above all because it bordered the country known as 'Nilia,'
now called 'Egypt,' where at that period those beings of our tribe existed who
wished to remain on



that planet, and upon whose help I was relying to collect the apes.
"Having alighted on the Red Sea, we left our ship Occasion and reached
the shore by 'hippodrenekakh', and afterward, on camels, we came to the city
where our beings existed, then the capital of the future Egypt. This capital city
was called 'Thebes.'
"On the very day of my arrival in the city of Thebes, one of the beings of
our tribe there told me, among other things, that the Earth-beings of that
locality had devised a new system for observing other cosmic concentrations
from their planet, and in order to put it into effect were then building the
required structures, and, as everybody was saying, this new system offered
advantages and possibilities hitherto unparalleled on the Earth.
"When he had told me all he had seen with his own eyes, I at once became
greatly interested, for from his account of certain details of this new
construction it seemed to me that these terrestrial beings had perhaps found a
way of overcoming a difficulty to which I myself had just been giving a great
deal of thought while completing the building of my observatory on the planet
Mars.
"And so I decided to postpone for a while my original intention of
immediately going farther south on that continent to collect the apes I needed,
and to go instead to the place where those structures were being erected, in
order to find out all about it for myself.
"Well then, the day after my arrival in the city of Thebes, I took as guide one
of the beings of our tribe who had many friends there, among them the chief
builder of those structures, and accompanied of course by our faithful Ahoon,
I traveled this time on what is called a 'choorteteff' down that great river now
known as the 'Nile.'



"Near the place where this river flowed into a large saliakooriapnian area,
those great artifacts were just being completed, certain parts of which
especially interested me.
"The district where the work was being carried on—both for this new
'observatory,' as they called it, and for other buildings designed for the
welfare of their being-existence —was then named 'Avazlin'; a few years later
it came to be called 'Caironana,' and today it is referred to simply as the
'outskirts of Cairo.'
"These great artifacts were begun long before my fourth flight to the Earth
by one of their 'pharaohs'—a title given to their kings by the beings of that
region—and at the time of my first visit to this place they were being
completed by his grandson, also a pharaoh.
"Although the observatory that interested me was not quite finished,
observations of the visibility of cosmic concentrations could be made from it,
and the results issuing from these concentrations as well as the reciprocal
action of these results could be studied.
"At that period on the Earth the beings occupied with such observations
and studies were called 'astrologers.' But later, when that psychic disease of
your favorites called 'wiseacring' was finally fixed in them, and these
specialists 'shriveled and shrank,' becoming 'specialists' only in giving names
to remote cosmic concentrations, they came to be called 'astronomers.'
"The difference in value and significance for the beings around them between
the professionals of that time and those who supposedly follow the same
occupation today may show you the extent of the decline that has steadily
taken place in the crystallization of data engendering 'sane logical mentation,'
which your favorites as three-brained beings ought to have in their common
presence; I therefore find



it necessary to explain this change for the worse, and help you reach an
approximate understanding of it.
"At that period, the terrestrial three-brained beings of responsible age
called 'astrologers,' besides making observations and investigations of various
other cosmic concentrations for the purpose of a more detailed study of the
branch of general learning they represented, took upon themselves several
other definite essence-obligations toward their fellow beings.
"One of their fundamental obligations was to advise, as our 'zirlikners' do,
all the conjugal pairs in their 'flock,' according to their types, about the time
and form of the process of the sacred 'elmooarno' for the purpose of a de
sirable and corresponding conception of their results And when these results
were actualized or, as they say, 'new-born,' the astrologers had to draw up for
each of them an 'oblekioonerish,' that is, what your favorites call a 'horoscope '
And from then on they or their deputies guided those young beings during the
whole period of their formation up to responsible age, as well as during their
responsible existence itself, giving them corresponding indications on the
basis of the oblekioonerish and of the cosmic laws, constantly explained by
them, relating to the action of the results of other large cosmic concentrations
on the process of being-existence on all planets.
"These indications and, so to speak, 'warning counsels' of theirs consisted
in the following:
"As soon as a function became disharmonized in the presence of any being,
or was only just beginning to be so, he would apply to the astrologer of his
district, who, on the basis of the oblekioonerish and of the variations expected
according to calculation in the atmospheric processes caused by the action of
other planets of their solar system, would indicate just what the disharmonized
being should do with



his planetary body at certain definite periods of the krentonalnian movement
of that planet, as for instance, in what direction to lie down, how to breathe,
what movements it was preferable to make, with which types of beings to
avoid relations, and many other things of this kind.
"Besides all this, the astrologers assigned to the beings of their flock in the
seventh year of their existence, again on the basis of their oblekioonerish,
corresponding mates of the opposite sex for the purpose of fulfilling one of
the chief being-duties, that is, the continuation of the species or, as your
favorites would say, they assigned them 'husbands' and 'wives.'
"Justice must be done to your favorites of that period as long as these
astrologers existed among them, they followed their counsels very strictly and
entered into conjugal unions only according to their indications.
"Therefore, at that period, in regard to their conjugal unions they always
corresponded to each other according to their types, just as they do on all
other planets inhabited by keschapmartnian beings Far as they were from
knowing many trogoautoegocratic cosmic truths, the ancient terrestrial
astrologers made these matches successfully because they had at least a
thorough knowledge of the laws governing the influence of the different
planets of their solar system on the beings breeding on their own planet, that
is, the influence of these planets on a being at the moment of his conception,
for further development as well as for his complete attainment of the being of
a responsible being.
"Thanks to the practical knowledge acquired over many centuries and
transmitted from generation to generation, they knew which types of the
passive sex corresponded to which types of the active sex. Thus the pairs
chosen according to the indications of the astrologers nearly always turned out
to be corresponding, which is the opposite of



what happens there today when your favorites are united in conjugal pairs
who almost never correspond in type; so that throughout their entire existence
about half of the so-called 'inner life' of these couples is spent on what our
esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin expresses in one of his sayings:
" 'What a good husband he is, and what a good wife she is, whose whole
inner world is not taken up with the constant nagging of the other half!'
"In any case, my boy, if these astrologers had continued to exist and practice
there, they surely would have acquired such experience that the existence of
the beings of this unfortunate planet would gradually have come to bear some
resemblance, at least in their family relations, to that of similar beings on
other planets of our Great Universe. But this beneficial practice, established in
the process of their existence, your favorites have thrown—as they have all
their other good attainments, without even having had time to make real use
of it—to the 'gluttonous swine' of our venerable Mullah Nasr Eddin.
"As usually happens there, these astrologers began gradually to 'shrink,'
and finally, as is said, they 'vanished.'
"After the function of the astrologers had been abolished, other
professionals in the same field appeared in their place, but this time from
among the 'learned beings of new formation,' who also began to observe and
study, as it were, the results issuing from the various large cosmic concentra
tions and their influence on the existence of the beings of their planet. But as
the ordinary beings around them soon noticed that their 'observations' and
'studies' consisted merely in inventing names for various remote suns and
planets—meaning nothing to them—among the milliards in the Universe, and
in supposedly measuring, by a method known to these professionals alone, the
distances between



the cosmic points seen from their planet through those 'playthings' of theirs,
which they also call 'telescopes,' they gave them, as I have already told you,
the name of 'astronomers. '
"Now that we have mentioned these contemporary 'ultra-fantasists,' so highly
esteemed by your favorites, it will do no harm to enlighten your Reason as to
their real significance.
"First of all, my boy, you should know about the existence of a 'something'
that is actualized for these terrestrial types, as it is in general for every cosmic
unit, and that serves for beings with Objective Reason as an 'initiating factor'
for comprehending the sense and meaning of any cosmic result This
'something,' which serves as an 'initiating factor' in evaluating the
significance of these contemporary terrestrial beings, is a wiseacring 'map'
named by them, of course unconsciously, an 'inventory of the heavenly
spaces. '
"There is no need to draw any other logical conclusion about this
'initiating factor' actualized specially for them, the very name of this map of
theirs is enough to show that its designations can only be relative With the
means at their disposal, even though they rack their 'esteemed brains' in
devising names and calculating various measurements, your favorites can see
only those suns and planets that, fortunately for them, do not change too
rapidly the course of their falling in relation to their own planet, thus making
it possible for them over long periods of time—long, of course, as compared
with the brevity of their own existence—to observe and, as they pompously
put it, 'mark down their positions.'
"In any case, my boy, whatever may result from the activities of these
contemporary representatives of 'science,' please don't hold it against them. If
they bring no good at all to your favorites, at least they do them no great harm
After all, they have to be occupied with something.
"It is not for nothing that they wear spectacles made in



Germany and special smocks sewn in England Let them be! Let them
be occupied with this, God bless them!
"Otherwise, like most of the other freaks there who are concerned,
as they say, with 'higher matters,' they will, out of boredom, busy
themselves with the struggle of 'five against one ' And everyone knows
that beings who are occupied with this exercise always radiate
vibrations very harmful for those around them.
"Well enough! . . .Let us leave these contemporary titillators in
peace and return once more to our interrupted theme.
"I think, my boy, that before I continue to speak about the observatory
and other structures erected for the welfare of the being-existence of
your favorites, you should know that the 'conscious power' of the
three-brained beings manifested in the creation of those great artifacts
that I saw with my own eyes—unparalleled before and after that
period—was also a result of the attainments of ordinary three-brained
beings, members of the learned Society of Akhldanns, which was
formed on the continent of Atlantis before the second great terrestrial
catastrophe, and so it will be appropriate if I first tell you, even though
briefly, the history of the arising of that truly great learned society.
"It is absolutely necessary to inform you of this history, because in the
course of my further explanations about those three-brained beings of
the planet Earth who have taken your fancy I shall probably have to
refer more than once to that society of learned beings.
"And I must tell you about the history of its arising and existence so
that you may realize that if something is attained by the three-brained
beings on your planet thanks to their being-partkdolgduty'—that is to
say, their conscious labor and intentional suffering—not only are these
attainments utilized by them for the welfare of their own being but also,



as with us, a certain part of these attainments is transmitted by heredity and
becomes the property of their direct descendants.
"You can perceive this law-conformable result in the fact that, although
abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence had begun to be established
even before the disappearance of the continent of Atlantis, and although after
the second great catastrophe they worsened to such an extent that the ableness
to manifest the possibilities proper to the presence of three-brained beings was
soon totally crushed in them, nevertheless, at least part of their scientific
attainments passed by inheritance, even though mechanically, to their remote
posterity.
"I must first tell you that I learned about the history of this society through
what are called 'teleoghinaras,' also found in the atmosphere of your planet
Earth As you probably do not yet know exactly what a 'teleoghinara' is, try to
transubstantiate in the corresponding parts of your common presence the
information concerning this cosmic actualization.
"A 'teleoghinara' is a materialized idea or thought, which after its arising
exists almost eternally in the atmosphere of the planet where it appeared.
" 'Teleoghinaras' can be formed from being-contemplation of a quality
such as only those three-brained beings have and can actualize who have
coated in their presences their higher being-bodies, and have brought the
perfecting of the Reason of these higher being-parts up to the degree of the
sacred 'Martfotai ' And a sequence of being-ideas materialized in this way
concerning a given event is called a 'korkaptilnian thought-tape.'
"The 'korkaptilnian thought-tapes' concerning the arising of the learned
Society of Akhldanns were, as I found out much later, intentionally fixed by a
certain eternal Individual, Asoochilon, now a saint, who became coated in the
common presence of a three-brained being named Tetetos,



who arose on the continent of Atlantis and existed there four centuries before
the second great transapalnian perturbation.
"These 'korkaptilnian thought-tapes' are never destroyed as long as the
given planet remains in the same 'tempo of movement' as at the moment of
their arising, and they are subject to none of those transformations, whatever
the cosmic cause, to which all other cosmic substances and crystallizations are
periodically subject And however long a time may have passed, every three
brained being who has acquired in his presence the ableness to enter into the
being-state called 'soorptakalknian contemplation' can perceive these
'korkaptilnian thought-tapes' and become aware of their contents'
"And so, my boy, I myself learned the details of the arising of the Society of
Akhldanns partly from the texts of these 'teleoghinaras' and partly from
numerous data I gathered much later when I made my usual detailed
investigations concerning a highly important fact that interested me From
these two sources of information it became evident to me that this learned
Society of Akhldanns, which arose on the continent of Atlantis and was
composed of three-brained beings of the Earth, was founded 735 years before
the second transapalnian perturbation.
"It was founded on the initiative of a being there named Belcultassi, who
was able to bring the perfecting of his highest being-part to the Being of a
Sacred Eternal Individual, and this highest part of his now dwells on the Holy
Planet Purgatory.
"In the course of my investigation of all the inner and outer being-impulses
and manifestations that led this Belcultassi to form that truly great society of
ordinary three-brained beings—'envied' in its day throughout the whole
Universe as 'worthy of imitation'—it appeared that one day while this future
Sacred Individual was engaged in contem



plation, according to the practice of every normal being, and by association
his thoughts were concentrated on himself, that is, on the meaning and aim of
his existence, he suddenly sensed and cognized that the functioning of the
whole of him had been proceeding until then not as it should have proceeded
according to sane logic.
"This unexpected realization shocked him so profoundly that thereafter he
devoted the whole of himself exclusively to becoming able at any cost to
unravel this and understand it.
"First of all, he decided to attain without delay the 'potency' that would
give him the force and the possibility to be absolutely sincere with himself,
that is, to be able to overcome those impulses which had become habitual in
the functioning of his common presence from the many heterogeneous
associations arising in him from all sorts of accidental shocks, coming from
outside and also engendered within, namely, the impulses called 'self-love,'
'pride,' 'vanity,' and so on.
"And when, after incredible what are called 'organic' and 'psychic' efforts,
he had attained this, he began, without mercy for these being-impulses that
had become inherent in his presence, to think and recall just which being
impulses had arisen in him on just what occasions in the course of his past
existence, and how he had, consciously or unconsciously, reacted to them.
"Analyzing himself in this manner, he began to recall exactly which
impulses had provoked this or that reaction in his 'independently spiritualized'
parts, that is, in his body, in his feelings, and in his thoughts, and the state of
his essence when he reacted to something more or less attentively, and how
and when, in consequence of such reactions, he had manifested consciously
with his 'I' or had acted automatically under the direction of his instinct alone.



"And it was then that this bearer of the future Sacred Individual,
Belcultassi, having in this way recalled all his former perceptions,
experiencings, and manifestations, clearly realized that his external
manifestations did not correspond at all either to his perceptions or to the
definite impulses formed in him.
"He then began to make similar sincere observations of impressions
coming from without as well as from within—at the very moment they were
perceived by his common presence, and he made all these observations with
the same exhaustive, conscious verifications of how these impressions were
perceived by each of his spiritualized parts, when and how they were
experienced by the whole of his presence, and for what manifestations they
became the impulses.
"These conscious observations and impartial verifications at last convinced
Belcultassi that in his common presence something was proceeding not as it
should proceed according to sane being-logic.
"As it became clear to me during my further detailed investigations, although
Belcultassi had become convinced of the accuracy of his observations of
himself, he doubted the validity of his own sensations and understanding, and
even the normality of his own psychic organization He therefore set himself
the task of verifying first of all whether he was in general normal in sensing
and understanding everything in this way and not otherwise.
"To carry out this task, he decided to find out whether others sensed and
cognized things in the same way he did. With this aim he began inquiring
among his friends and acquaintances, trying to learn from them how they
sensed all this, and how they cognized their perceptions and manifestations,
both past and present—doing so of course very



discreetly, to avoid touching those impulses inherent in them of self-love, pride, and so on. "Thanks to his inquiries, Belcultassi gradually succeeded in evoking sincerity in his friends and acquaintances, and as a result he learned that they all sensed and saw everything in themselves the same way that he did. "Now among these friends and acquaintances of his were several serious beings not yet entirely enslaved by the action of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, and they also, having penetrated to the gist of the matter, became very deeply interested in it, and continued to verify what proceeded in themselves and independently to observe those around them. "Shortly afterward, again on the initiative of Belcultassi, they began to meet together from time to time to share their observations and findings. As a result of prolonged verifications, observations, and impartial conclusions, this entire group of terrestrial beings became absolutely convinced, as Belcultassi was, that they were not as they ought to be. "A little later many other beings who also had such a presence joined their group. And still later they founded the society which they named the 'Society of Akhldanns.' "The word 'akhldann' then expressed the following concept: 'the striving to become aware of the sense and aim of the Being of beings.'
"From the day of the founding of this society, Belcultassi himself stood at its head, and the activities of its members were carried out under his general guidance. For many of their years the society existed under the same name, and its members were called 'Akhldannsovors'; but later, when for purposes of a general character they divided up into a number of independent groups, the members came to be called by the names of their different groups.



"And this division into groups took place for the following reason:
"When the members of the society had become definitely convinced that
there was something very undesirable in their presence, they began to search
for every possible means of achieving its removal from themselves, in order to
become able to be what they ought to have been according to sane logic, and
thus to correspond to the sense and aim of their existence, the elucidation of
which they had determined to carry out at any cost as the very basis of their
task But when they began to put into practice this task decided on by their
Reason, they soon realized that in order to fulfill it they must first collect more
detailed information in various special branches of knowledge.
"And as it proved impossible for each of them individually to acquire all
the necessary specialized knowledge, they divided up for convenience into a
number of groups, so that each group could study one of the special branches
of knowledge required for their common aim.
"Here you should note, my boy, that it was then that genuine Objective
Science arose there for the first time, and developed normally until the second
great catastrophe to their planet—certain of its branches even developing at an
unprecedented rate Consequently, during that period many objective cosmic
truths, great and small, gradually became evident to those three-brained beings
who have taken your fancy.
"The members of this first, and perhaps last, great terrestrial learned society
were then divided into seven independent groups or 'sections,' and each of
these sections received a specific designation.
"The members of the first group of the Akhldann Society were called
'Akhldann-fokhsovors,' which meant that they



studied the presence of their own planet and the reciprocal action of its separate parts. "The members of the second section were called 'Akhldann-strassovors,'
and this meant that they studied the 'radiations' of all the other planets of their
solar system and the reciprocal action of these radiations.
"The members belonging to the third section were called 'Akhldannmetrosovors,' which meant beings occupied with the study of that branch of knowledge similar to our 'silkoornano,' corresponding in part to what your contemporary favorites call 'mathematics.' "The members of the fourth group were called 'Akhldann-psychosovors,' a
name designating those members of the society who made observations of the
perceptions, experiencings, and manifestations of beings like themselves
observations that they verified statistically.
"The members of the fifth group were called 'Akhldann-harnosovors,'
which meant that they were occupied with the study of the branch of
knowledge that combined the two contemporary terrestrial sciences called by
your favorites 'chemistry' and 'physics.'
"The members belonging to the sixth section were called 'Akhldann
mistessovors,' that is to say, beings who studied all kinds of outer events,
whether actualized consciously or arising by themselves, and further studied
which of these events were erroneously perceived by beings, and in what
circumstances.
"And as regards the members of the seventh and last group, they were
called 'Akhldann-gezpoodjnisovors.' These members of the Akhldann Society
devoted themselves to the study of those manifestations of the three-brained
beings of their planet proceeding in them not as a result of various
functionings coming from impulses of different kinds engendered by data
already present in them, but as a



result of cosmic influences coming from outside and not depending on the
beings themselves.
"The three-brained beings of your planet who became members of this
society actually approached Objective Knowledge to a degree that had never
been reached before and perhaps will never be reached again.
"And here it is impossible not to express regret that, to the great misfortune of
the terrestrial three-brained beings of all later epochs, just at the moment
when, after incredible being-efforts by the members of that great society, the
required tempo of work had finally been established—both with regard to the
conscious discernment of themselves and the unconscious preparation for the
welfare of their descendants—just at the height of all their efforts, as I said,
certain of them ascertained that something serious was soon to befall their
planet.
"In order to determine the character of the serious event they anticipated,
they dispersed over the whole planet and, shortly afterward, as you already
know, the second transapalnian perturbation occurred to that ill-fated planet
of yours.
"Well then, my boy, after this catastrophe, a number of the members of that
great learned society who had survived gradually came together again and,
having lost their native land, first settled with other surviving beings in the
center of the continent of Grabontzi, but later, when they had somewhat come
to themselves after this 'cataclysm not according to law,' they jointly decided
to try to reestablish their society and perhaps to resume and fulfill in practice
all the tasks that had formed its basis Unfortunately, on that part of the surface
of the continent of Grabontzi the abnormal conditions of being-existence
already established before the



catastrophe had by this time begun to 'boil furiously'; and so these surviving
members of the Akhldann Society looked for another place on that continent
for their permanent existence more suitable for carrying on their work, which
demanded complete seclusion.
"They found a suitable place in the valley of the large river flowing
northward on that continent and they all migrated there with their families, in
order to continue in seclusion to fulfill the tasks undertaken by their society.
"The entire region through which this great river flowed they first named
'Sakronakari.' This name was afterward changed several times and today that
region is called 'Egypt,' while the great river then known as 'Nipilhooatchi,' is
now, as I have already said, called the 'Nile.'
"Not long after these former members of the learned Society of Akhldanns
had settled on this part of the surface of the planet Earth, all the beings of our
tribe then existing on that planet migrated to the same place. The relationship
of the beings of our tribe with that part of the surface of your planet, and also
with those former members of the Society of Akhldanns who by chance had
survived, came about as follows.
"I once told you that, just before the second transapalnian perturbation, our
'pythoness' during a prophecy had insisted that for the continuation of their
existence on that planet all the beings of our tribe should migrate without
delay to a definite part of the same continent, now called 'Africa.' The part of
the continent indicated by the 'pythoness' lay near the source of the river
Nipilhooatchi, and the beings of our tribe existed there during the whole of
the second transapalnian perturbation and also later, when things became
relatively normal and most of the surviving terrestrial beings had almost
forgotten the catastrophe, and had again formed—just as if nothing had
happened to them—one of their famous 'centers of culture' in the very heart of
the future



Africa. And while the former members of the Society of Akhldanns were
looking for a suitable place for their permanent existence, they chanced to
meet several beings of our tribe, who advised them to migrate farther down
the same river.
"Our friendly relations with many of the former members of the Society of
Akhldanns had begun on the continent of Atlantis and went back almost to the
founding of that society Do you remember, I told you that when I descended
to that planet for the first time, the beings of our tribe were assembled in the
city of Samlios in order, with my participation, to find some way out of the
difficult situation that had been created? Well then, those general meetings of
ours were held in one of the chapter halls of the principal 'cathedral' of the
Society of Akhldanns, and from that time on good relations were established
between the beings of our tribe and certain members of that society.
"And there, in the future Egypt, where both of these groups of beings had
migrated as I have described, the relations of the beings of our tribe with
those former members who had by chance survived, and also with their
descendants, lasted without interruption almost until the departure of our tribe
from your planet.
"The hope of the few surviving members of the Society of Akhldanns that
they would be able to revive the society and carry out its tasks was not
fulfilled Nevertheless, thanks to them alone, there was preserved in the
presence of the beings of several generations after the loss of Atlantis the
sense and 'instinctive conviction' of the need for what is called 'completed
personal being.
"It was also thanks to them that certain attainments of the Reason of the
three-brained beings there survived as long as their Reason remained normal,
and after a while began to be transmitted mechanically from generation to
generation,



reaching the beings of quite recent periods and even certain beings of the
present day.
"Among the results of the scientific attainments of the members of the
Akhldann Society, transmitted by inheritance, were also unquestionably those
imposing and ingenious 'structures' that, during the fourth descent of mine to
your planet, I saw being erected by the beings breeding on that part of the
present Africa.
"Although, when I saw this new observatory with my own eyes, the
expectations I had formed about it from everything our countrymen had told
me were not justified, nevertheless this observatory and the other architectural
works of the beings of that region proved to be exceedingly ingenious, and
aroused in my common presence data that enriched my consciousness with a
great deal of productive information.
"So that you may clearly represent to yourself and understand how these
structures were erected by the three-brained beings of this region for the
welfare of their being-existence it will be enough, I think, if I explain to you
in as great detail as possible how the particularity of their ingenious and
practical inventions was manifested in this new observatory, on account of
which I had decided to visit that place.
"To begin with, I must inform you of two facts related to the change in the
common presence of these three-brained beings who have taken your fancy.
"The first fact is that at the beginning, while they were still existing
normally in a manner becoming to all three-brained beings in general and
while they still had what is called 'olooestesnokhnian sight,' they could
perceive with their own eyes the visibility of all great and small cosmic
concentrations existing beyond them during any process of the Omnipresent
Okidanokh taking place in their atmosphere up to a distance proper to the
vision of ordinary three-brained beings.



"Moreover, those who had consciously perfected themselves and who had
thereby brought the sensitivity of perception of their organ of sight up to what
is called the 'olooessultratesnokhnian state,' acquired, as do three-brained
beings everywhere else, the possibility of perceiving, at that same distance,
the visibility of all cosmic units whose arising and further existence depend
upon crystallizations coming directly from the sacred Theomertmalogos, that
is to say, from the emanations of our Most Holy Sun Absolute.
"And when the abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence had
become fixed there, and when, for reasons I have already told you about,
Great Nature was compelled, among other restrictive measures, to degrade the
functioning of their organ of sight to what is called the 'koritesnokhnian'
level—proper only to the presence of one-brained and two-brained beings
from that time on the three-brained beings there were able to perceive the
visibility of any great or small cosmic concentrations situated beyond them
only when the sacred process of 'Aieioiuoa' proceeded in the 'omnipresent
active element' Okidanokh in the atmosphere of their planet or, as they say,
according to their understanding and perceptions, in the 'dark of night. '
"The second fact, also related to the degeneration of their sight to the
'koritesnokhnian' level, is based on a law common to all beings, namely, that
the results of any manifestation of the Omnipresent Okidanokh are perceived
only when the organ of sight is in immediate contact with the vibrations
formed in beings which actualize the functioning of that being-organ,
enabling it at the given moment to perceive the visibility of cosmic
concentrations situated beyond them, that is to say, the results of any
manifestation of the Omnipresent Okidanokh are perceived only when they
take place within certain limits—depending upon the quality of perception
attained by the given organ—and beyond these limits what is called the
'momentum of the



impulse' dies down; or, to put it otherwise, these beings perceive the visibility of objects only when they are almost next to them. "But if these results take place beyond the mentioned limits, this manifestation does not reach those beings in whose presence the organs of visual perception have been formed only by the results of the totality of 'itoklanotz.' "Here it is opportune to recall one of the profound sayings of our Mullah Nasr Eddin, which very neatly fits the present case, that is, the degree to which the visual perception of your contemporary favorites is limited. This wise saying of his, seldom used there, consists of the following words: 'Show me the elephant the blind man has seen—and then I will believe that you really see a fly.'
"Well, my boy, thanks to the artificial devices for the observation of other cosmic concentrations which I had seen, and which were being constructed in that future Egypt on the initiative coming from the Reason of the remote descendants of the members of the learned Society of Akhldanns, any one of these unfortunate favorites of yours, in spite of the 'koritesnokhnian' sight that had long before become inherent in them, acquired the power to perceive freely at any time, as they say, 'of the day or night' the visibility of all those remote cosmic concentrations which during the process of the general harmonious movement fell within the sphere of their observation. "To compensate for the limitation of their organ of visual perception they invented the following: instead of placing their 'teskooano,' or telescope, on the surface of the planet, as was the custom in those days and still is, they placed it very deep within the planet, according to an idea which, by the way, had also come down to them from their remote ancestors, and carried out their observations of cosmic con



centrations found beyond the atmosphere of the Earth through specially
hollowed-out 'shafts.'
"The observatory I then saw had five of these shafts Each of them opened
toward the horizon from a different point in the space occupied by the
observatory, but they all converged at a small underground hollow, something
like a 'cave ' From there the specialists of that time, called 'astrologers,' made
their observations for the purpose of studying, as I have already told you, the
visible presences and the results of the reciprocal action of cosmic
concentrations belonging to their own solar system as well as to other systems
of our Great Universe.
"They made their observations through any one of the five shafts, which
looked out in different directions toward the horizon, according to the given
position of their planet in the process of the 'common-cosmic harmonious
movement' in relation to the cosmic concentration being observed.
"I repeat, my boy, that although the chief particularity of the observatory
erected by the three-brained beings of the future Egypt was not new to me,
since this principle had also been applied in my observatory on Mars—the
only difference being that my seven long tubes were placed not within the
planet but on its surface—nevertheless all their innovations were so
interesting that, for any eventuality, I even made a detailed sketch of
everything I saw during my stay there, and later made use of some of it in my
own observatory.
"As for the other large structures there, I shall perhaps tell you more about
them later Meanwhile I shall only say that all these separate, still unfinished
structures were laid out not far from the observatory itself and, as I learned
upon examining them under the guidance of the chief builder, a friend of one
of our tribe, they were intended partly for the



observation of other suns and planets of our Great Universe, and partly for
determining and intentionally directing the currents of the surrounding
atmosphere so as to obtain the 'climate' desired.
"All these structures occupied a fairly large area in that locality and were
enclosed within a special lattice fence made of the plant known there as
'zalnakatar.'
"It is very interesting to note here that at the main entrance to that vast
enclosure they had erected a rather large stone figure—large of course in
comparison with the size of their presences—called the 'Sphinx,' which
strongly reminded me of the statue I had seen on my first descent in person to
your planet in the city of Samlios, just opposite the enormous building
belonging to the learned Society of Akhldanns, which was then known as the
'principal cathedral' of this society.
"The statue I saw in the city of Samlios and which greatly interested me
was the emblem of the society, and was called 'Conscience.'
"It represented an allegorical being, each part of whose planetary body
represented one part of the planetary body of some definite form of being
existing on the Earth, which, according to the notions crystallized in the three
brained beings there, expressed to perfection one or another being-function.
"The mass of the planetary body of this allegorical being was represented
by the 'trunk' of a terrestrial being of definite form called 'bull.'
"This bull trunk rested on the four legs of another form of being existing
there called 'lion'; and to the part of the trunk called the 'back' were attached
two large wings, similar in appearance to those of a powerful bird-being
breeding there called 'eagle.'
"And at the place where the head should have been, there



were fixed to the bull's trunk by means of a piece of 'amber' two breasts representing the 'breasts of a virgin. ' "When I became interested in this strange allegorical figure on the
continent of Atlantis and inquired about its meaning, one of the learned
members of the great society of men-beings gave me the following
explanation:
" 'This allegorical figure is the emblem of the Society of Akhldanns, and
serves as a stimulus for all its members constantly to recall and awaken in
themselves the impulses corresponding to those it represents.
"And he went on to say: " 'Each part of this allegorical figure arouses in every member of our
society, in the three independently associating parts of his common presence,
that is, in the body, in the thoughts, and in the feelings, a shock calling forth
corresponding associations for the separate realizations which, in their totality,
alone make it possible for us to rid ourselves little by little of the maleficent
factors present in every one of us, both those factors transmitted by heredity
and those we have ourselves acquired, which gradually engender within us
undesirable impulses, as a consequence of which we are not what we might be.
" 'This emblem of ours constantly reminds us and indicates to us that it is
possible to attain freedom from those factors only if we unremittingly compel
our common presences to think, feel, and act under all circumstances in
accordance with what is expressed in this allegorical figure.
" 'And all of us who are members of the Society of Akhldanns understand
our emblem in the following way:
'The trunk of this allegorical being, represented by that of a bull, means
that the factors crystallized in us, both inherited and personally acquired,
which engender in our presences those maleficent impulses can be regenerated
only by indefatigable labors—those labors for which, among all the beings of
our planet, the "bull" is particularly fitted



" 'That this trunk rests on the legs of a lion means that these labors must be
performed with the awareness and feeling of courage and of faith in one's
'might'—that property possessed in the highest degree, among all the beings of
the Earth, by the being to whom these legs belong, the mighty "lion."
'The wings of the strongest and highest-soaring of birds, the "eagle,"
attached to the bull's trunk, constantly remind the members of our society that,
during these labors, and while experiencing this inner psychic property of self
respect, one must meditate unceasingly on questions not concerned with the
manifestations directly required for ordinary being-existence.
'As regards the strange image of the head of our allegorical being in the
form of the "breasts of a virgin," this means that "love" should predominate
always and in everything during the inner and outer functionings evoked by
one's consciousness—such a love as can arise and exist only in the presence of
concentrations formed in the lawful parts of every whole responsible being in
whom the hopes of our Common Father are placed.
" 'And that the head is fixed to the trunk of the bull with amber signifies
that this love should be strictly impartial, that is to say, completely separated
from all the other functions proceeding in every whole responsible being.
"In order, my boy, for you to understand the meaning symbolized by the
material known there as 'amber,' I must add that amber is one of the seven
planetary formations in the arising of which the 'omnipresent active element'
Okidanokh enters with its three separate, independent, and sacred parts in
equal proportions, and, in the process of planetary actualization, these
intraplanetary and surplanetary formations serve to impede the independent
flow of the three separate streams of these three localized sacred parts.



At this point in his tale, Beelzebub paused for a moment, as if pondering
something, and then continued:
"While I was describing to you what I then saw on a part of the surface of
your planet still surviving today, where there existed certain direct
descendants of the members of that truly great learned Society of Akhldanns,
there were gradually revived in me—as a result of the manifestations of my
being-Reason and due to the effect of various associations aroused by the
visual impressions of the environment of that region—all the scenes and the
whole series of associative thoughts evoking a certain being-experiencing of
mine that occurred during my last stay there when I visited contemporary
Egypt and was sitting one day absorbed in thought at the foot of one of those
ancient structures which have chanced to survive from that period and are
called today the 'pyramids.'
"And in the general functioning of my Reason there proceeded, among
other things, the following reflections:
"Good! . . . If not even one of the benefits for ordinary being-existence
formerly attained by the Reason of the beings of the continent of Atlantis has
come down by inheritance to contemporary beings of your planet, this could
perhaps be logically justified by the simple fact that, for cosmic reasons
neither issuing from the three-brained beings there nor in any way depending
upon them, the second great cataclysm not according to law occurred, in
which not only this continent itself perished but also almost everything ex
isting upon it.
"But Egypt! Was not its magnificence still quite recent? "There is no denying it. "As a result of the third small catastrophe to that ill-fated planet, and of the
fifth—about which I will speak later—this part of its surface was covered with
sand. Nevertheless, the three-brained beings dwelling there did not perish, but
were only scattered over various other parts of the same continent,



and so in whatever new conditions they found themselves, there should have
been preserved in their presence the crystallized results of the factors
perfected for normal 'being-logical mentation,' transmitted to them by heredity.
"Well, my boy, after these distressing 'alstoozori' of mine or, as your
favorites would say, 'sorrowful reflections,' I wished to clarify for myself the
true cause of this lamentable fact, and as a result of careful investigations I
finally understood and became aware with my whole being that this
abnormality is due exclusively to one aspect of the chief particularity of their
strange psyche, that particularity which has become a completely crystallized,
inseparable part of their common presence and serves as a factor for the pe
riodic arising in them of the 'urgent need to destroy everything outside
themselves.
"For when this particularity of their psyche—horrifying for every being
with Reason—reaches its climax and those three-brained beings begin to
manifest it outwardly, that is to say, when they begin to carry out the process
of reciprocal destruction on some part of the surface of their planet, then, at
the same time, just in passing, as it were, with no deliberate aim and even
without what is called 'organic need,' they also destroy everything that comes
within range of their organ of sight. At the height of these psychopathic parox
ysms, the beings between whom this terrible process takes place destroy not
only each others' intentionally produced objects but also works of the beings
of former ages that have chanced to survive and reach them intact.
"And so it was, my boy, that at the period of my fourth sojourn on the surface
of your planet, and after my arrival in the country now known as 'Egypt,' I
stayed there several days among the remote descendants of the members of
the learned Society of Akhldanns, and became acquainted with certain results
of their being-partkdolgduty that had survived



for the welfare of their descendants. Then, accompanied by two members of
our tribe, I went to the southern countries of this continent where, with the
help of the local three-brained beings, I captured the desired number of ape
beings.
"Having accomplished this, I signaled telepathically to our ship Occasion,
which descended to us, it must be said, on the first very dark night And when
we had loaded the ape-beings into the special compartment of the ship that
had been arranged for Gornahoor Harharkh under his own direction, we
reascended to the planet Mars, and three Martian days later, taking the apes
with me, I ascended on the same ship to the planet Saturn.
"Though we had decided to carry out the experiments on the apes only in
the following year, when they would have become thoroughly acclimatized
and adapted to their new conditions of existence, I ascended to the planet
Saturn without delay, because at my last meeting with Gornahoor Harharkh I
had promised him to be present at a family solemnity that was soon to take
place.
"This family solemnity, called a 'khri-khra-khri,' was the consecration by
the beings around Gornahoor Harharkh of his recently arisen first heir
"I had promised to attend this family solemnity in order to take upon
myself toward this first heir of his what is called the 'alnatoorornian being
duty.'
"Here it is interesting to remark that the ceremony for assuming this being
duty also took place in ancient times among the three-brained beings of your
planet and has even come down to your contemporary favorites but, just as in
everything else, they have kept only the external form of this serious and
important procedure The beings who, as it were, take this obligation upon
themselves are called by your contemporary favorites 'godfathers' and
'godmothers.'
"This first heir of Gornahoor Harharkh was then named Raoorkh."



CHAPTER 24
Beelzebub's fifth flight to the planet Earth
BEELZEBUB continued his tale as follows: "After my fourth sojourn on the surface of the planet Earth, many years passed by.
"During these years, of course only from time to time, I attentively observed through my teskooano the being-existence of these favorites of yours. "By now their numbers had considerably increased, and they were already
populating almost all the large and small land masses on your planet, and of
course their chief particularity continued to manifest itself, that is to say,
every so often they would begin to destroy each other's existence.
"During this time, that is, between my fourth and fifth visits, the surface of your planet underwent great changes, particularly in the places where the existence of your favorites was concentrated For example, their 'centers of culture' on the continent of Ashhark that I had personally visited on my previous descents to the Earth, namely, the countries of Tikliamish and Maralpleicie, had entirely disappeared by the time of my fifth arrival there "The cause of the destruction of these 'centers of culture' and of the changes on the surface of the Earth was a new catastrophe, the third for this ill-fated planet. "This third catastrophe was entirely local in character, and occurred as a
result of unprecedented accelerated 'displacements of parts of the atmosphere'
or, as your favorites would say, 'great winds,' which lasted several years.
"And the cause of these abnormal displacements, or 'great winds,' was
once again those two fragments which had broken off from this planet of
yours during the first great ca



lamity and which later became small independent planets of that solar system,
known today as the 'Moon' and 'Anulios.'
"Strictly speaking, the main cause of this third terrestrial catastrophe was
the larger of the fragments, namely the Moon, the smaller fragment, Anulios,
played no part in it whatsoever.
"The accelerated displacements in the Earth's atmosphere came about in
the following way:
"When the atmosphere around the small, accidentally arisen planet Moon
had been finally formed, and the Moon was still falling back upon its
fundamental mass, by a path established according to the already mentioned
'law of catching up,' and this newly arisen definite presence around the Moon
had not yet acquired its own harmony within the 'common-system harmony of
movement,' then the 'osmooalnian friction,' as it is called, not being
harmonized with the whole, provoked in the Earth's atmosphere these
accelerated displacements, or 'great winds.'
"And by the force of their currents these unprecedented 'great winds' began
to wear away the projecting land masses and to fill up the corresponding
depressions.
"Among these depressions were the two regions of the continent of
Ashhark where the process of existence of the first and second groups of the
beings of what is now called 'Asia' were chiefly concentrated, that is to say,
the main parts of the countries of Tikliamish and Maralpleicie.
"Certain parts of the country of Pearl-land were also covered by sand, as
well as the region in the middle of the continent of Grabontzi where, after the
loss of Atlantis, there was formed the leading 'center of culture,' as they called
it, for all the three-brained beings there—a region that in those times was the
most flourishing part of the surface of your planet and is now a desert, known
as the 'Sahara.'
"Bear in mind that, besides the countries I have men



tioned, several other smallish land surfaces of that hapless planet were also
covered by sand as a result of those abnormal winds.
"It is interesting to note here that your contemporary favorites also learned, by
some means or other, that the three-centered beings of that period changed the
places of their permanent existence, and having attached one of their 'labels'
to this, namely, the 'great migration of races,' they stuck it on to what they call
their 'knowledge.'
"A number of the 'learned' there are now puffing and blowing with all their
might to find out why and how it all occurred, so that they can tell everybody
else about it.
"At the present time there are several theories about this that have nothing
in common and, in an objective sense, are each more absurd than the other,
but are nevertheless recognized there by what is called 'official science.'
"But in fact, the true cause of the migration of the three-centered beings of
that epoch was that as soon as this process of erosion began, the beings
inhabiting the continent of Ash-hark, fearing to be buried by the sands, started
to move to other, safer places. And this migration took place in the following
order:
"Most of the three-brained beings populating Tikliamish moved to the
southern part of the continent of Ashhark, to the country later called 'Persia,'
while the rest moved north and settled in the regions afterward called
'Kirghizcheri.'
"As for the beings inhabiting the country of Maralpleicie, some wandered
eastward, while the others, the majority, went toward the west.
"Those who went east, after crossing high mountains, settled on the shores
of a large 'saliakooriapnian' space, in the region later called 'China.'
"And those beings of Maralpleicie who had sought safety by moving to the west, after wandering from place to place,



ultimately reached the neighboring continent, later called 'Europe. '
"As for the three-brained beings who existed in the middle of the continent
of Grabontzi, they dispersed over the whole surface of the planet.
"Well, my boy, this fifth flight of mine to your planet took place during the
period just after the redistribution of the various groups of these favorites of
yours.
"And it took place on account of the following events: "First of all I must tell you that the chief particularity of the psyche of your
favorites, namely, their 'periodic need to destroy the existence of beings like
themselves,' interested me more and more with each succeeding century of
theirs, and parallel with this, the irresistible urge grew in me to find out the
exact cause of a particularity so phenomenal for three-brained beings.
"That is why, my boy, in the interval between my fourth and fifth sojourns
on the planet Earth, in order to have more material that might throw light
upon this question that interested me so intensely, with the help of my
teskooano on the planet Mars I organized my observations of the existence of
those peculiar three-brained beings in the following way:
"I purposely selected a large number of individual beings from among
your favorites, and during many of their years, either I personally or someone
I specially commissioned kept them under close observation, trying as much
as possible not to miss anything, and to clarify for myself from every aspect
all the particularities in their manifestations during the process of their
ordinary existence.
"And I must confess, my boy, that when I happened to be quite free, I
sometimes followed with great interest, for whole 'sinonooms'—or, as your
favorites approximately define the corresponding flow of time, for whole
'hours'—the movements of those three-brained beings selected by me,



trying to find a logical explanation for what are called their 'psychic
experiencings.'
"And so, one day, while I was carrying on these observations from the planet
Mars through my teskooano, it flashed upon me that the length of their
existence was, century by century, and even year by year, becoming shorter,
at a very definite and uniform rate; and this served as the starting point for my
subsequent intensive study of the psyche of these three-brained beings who
have taken your fancy.
"Of course, when I first became aware of this, I immediately took into
account not only the chief particularity of their psyche, that is, their periodic
reciprocal destruction, but also the innumerable what are called 'diseases'
found exclusively on that planet, and most of which, by the way, arose and
continue to arise owing as always to the abnormal external conditions of
ordinary being-existence they themselves have established—conditions that
are greatly to blame for their inability to exist normally until the sacred
'rascooarno.'
"When I noticed this for the first time, and began to recall my former
impressions on the subject, this fact flashed upon my essence, and each of the
separate independent spiritualized parts of my whole presence became filled
with the conviction that in the beginning these three-brained beings of your
planet had actually existed, according to their time calculation, for as many as
twelve, and some of them even for fifteen centuries.
"For you to have a clearer picture of the rate at which the length of their
existence diminished during this period, it is enough to tell you that when I
left that solar system forever, the maximum length of their existence had
decreased to no more than seventy to ninety of their years.
"And in recent times, if one of them were to exist even



as long as this, all the other beings of that peculiar planet would consider that
he had lived to a 'great age.'
"And if anyone were to exist for a little over a century he would be
exhibited in their museums, and of course all the rest of the beings there
would know about him because his 'photograph' and descriptions of his
manner of existence, down to each step he takes, would keep appearing in all
their 'newspapers,' as they are called.
"So, my boy, since at the time when I suddenly became aware of this fact I
had no special business on the planet Mars, and since it was quite impossible
to try to probe this new peculiarity by means of the teskooano, I decided to go
in person to the planet Earth, in order to clear up for myself on the spot the
causes of this phenomenon.
"Several Martian days after my decision, I again flew there on the ship
Occasion.
"At the time of this fifth flight of mine to your planet, their 'center for the
incoming and outgoing results of the perfecting of being-comprehension' or
their 'center of culture,' as they call it, was the city of 'Babylon', so it was just
there that I decided to go.
"This time our ship Occasion alighted on what is now called the 'Persian
Gulf,' because before our flight we had ascertained through the teskooano that
the most convenient place both for our plan of travel—which was to reach the
city of Babylon—and for the mooring of our ship Occasion would be that
particular saliakooriapnian space of the surface of your planet.
"This expanse of water was convenient for my further travels because the
large river on whose banks stood the city of Babylon flowed into it, and we
proposed to go up this river in order to reach the city.



"In those days, the 'incomparably majestic' Babylon was flourishing in every
respect It was a 'center of culture' not only for the beings dwelling on the
continent of Ashhark but also for the beings of all the other land masses, large
and small, which were adapted to the needs of ordinary being-existence on
that planet.
"When I first arrived in this 'center of culture' of theirs, they were just then
preparing what later became the principal cause of acceleration in the rate of
degeneration of their 'psychic organization,' especially in the sense of the
atrophy in them of the instinctive functioning of those three fundamental
factors which ought to exist in the presence of every three-brained being
namely, those factors which give rise to the being-impulses existing under the
names of 'Faith,' 'Hope,' and 'Love. '
"And the degeneration of these being-factors, increasing from one
generation to another, has reached such a point that instead of the real being
psyche that should exist in the presence of every kind of three-brained being,
there now exists in the presence of your contemporary favorites a 'real'
psyche, to be sure, but one that can be very well described by the following
wise saying of our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin 'It has everything in it except the
core, or even the kernel.
"I must not fail to tell you as fully as possible what occurred during that
period in Babylon, as all this information may serve you as valuable material
for helping to elucidate and transmute in your Reason all the causes that taken
together have finally given rise to that psyche, so strange for three-centered
beings, which your contemporary favorites now have.
"To begin with, I must tell you that I obtained the information about the
events I am going to relate chiefly from those beings whom the other three
centered beings there call 'learned.'



"And before going any further, I must dwell a little on just what kind of beings are considered 'learned' by the others on your planet. "Even before my fifth sojourn there, that is, before the period when, as I
have told you, Babylon was in full flower, those who were regarded by others
as 'learned' were not such beings as become worthy to be considered learned
everywhere else in the Universe, namely, those who from the earliest times,
even on your planet, have acquired by their conscious labor and intentional
suffering the ability to contemplate all the details of everything that exists
from the point of view of world-arising and world-existence, which enables
them to perfect their highest being-body to the corresponding degree of the
Sacred Scale of Objective Reason, and later to sense the cosmic truths
accessible to this highest body, according to its level of development But ever
since the time of what is called the 'Tikliamishian civilization,' and especially
in our era, the beings there who become 'learned' are almost always those who
have learned by rote the greatest possible amount of vacuous information,
such as old women love to repeat about what was supposed to have been said
in the 'good old days.'
"Note, by the way, that our venerated Mullah Nasr Eddin expresses the
importance of such learned beings as follows 'Everybody seems to believe
that our learned professors know that half a hundred is fifty. '
"There on your planet, the more such information one of your favorites
stores up—information he has never verified, and moreover has never sensed
for himself—the more 'learned' he is considered to be.
"Well, my boy, when we reached the city of Babylon, it was literally overflowing with 'learned' beings, who were gathered there from almost everywhere on your planet.



"As the reason for their gathering is extremely interesting, I will tell you something about this also. "The point is that most of the learned beings of the Earth had been
assembled there under compulsion by a highly eccentric Persian king, under
whose dominion at that period was also the city of Babylon.
"To help you understand the fundamental aspect of all the results of the
abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence that gave rise to the
eccentricity of this Persian king, I must first enlighten you about two facts
that had been established long before.
"The first of these facts is that, almost from the time of the loss of the
continent of Atlantis, there gradually began to be crystallized and in later
centuries to be definitely fixed in the presence of every one of your favorites a
particular property, thanks to which the sensation called 'happiness for one's
being'—experienced from time to time by every three-brained being from the
satisfaction of his inner self-evaluation—appears in their presence exclusively
when they have at their disposal a great deal of that famous metal they call
'gold. '
"The worst of it is that, because of this particular property in their common
presence, the sensation arising from the possession of that metal is reinforced
by the beings surrounding the possessor, and even by those beings who learn
about it only by hearsay rather than through their own perceptions At the
same time it is the custom there never to take into account the kind of being
manifestations through which someone came to own a great quantity of this
metal, and what is more, such a being evokes in the presences of all those
around him the functioning of that crystallized consequence of the properties
of the organ kundabuffer called 'envy.'
"And the second fact is this, that when their chief particularity functions in the presences of your favorites at an



accelerated tempo, and the process of reciprocal destruction breaks out among
their different communities according to established custom, then after this
maleficent property, inherent in them alone, has run its course and this process
of theirs ceases for a while, the king of the community in which a greater
number of subjects has survived, on receiving the title of 'conqueror,' usually
seizes for himself everything belonging to the beings of the conquered
community.
"The king-conqueror then usually commands his subjects to despoil the
conquered community of all their lands, and to seize all the young beings of
female sex and all the 'riches' accumulated in the course of centuries.
"Well, my boy, when the subjects of that eccentric Persian king conquered the
beings of another community, he ordered them not to take or even touch any
of these, but instead to bring back as 'captives' only the learned beings of the
conquered community.
"In order to represent clearly to yourself and understand just why this
peculiar craze, proper to him alone, arose in the individuality of that Persian
king, you must know that at the period of the Tikliamishian civilization, in the
town of 'Chiklaral,' a learned three-brained being by the name of
Harnakhoom—whose essence later became crystallized into what is called an
'Eternal Hasnamuss Individual'—invented the notion that any old metal you
like, found in abundance on the surface of that planet, could easily be
transformed into the rare metal 'gold', and that all you needed to know for this
was one very small secret.
"This pernicious invention of his became widely spread there and, having
become crystallized in the presence of the beings of that time, passed from
generation to generation and gradually took the form of a maleficent, fantastic
science under the name of 'alchemy'—the very name of that great science
which had indeed existed there as a branch of genuine



knowledge during long-past epochs when the consequences of the properties
of the organ kundabuffer had not yet been completely crystallized in the
presence of their ancestors— a science that could have been most useful, or
indeed essential, for all three-brained beings there, even of contemporary
times.
"Now at that period to which my tale relates, this Persian king needed for
one or another of his undoubtedly hasnamussian aims a large amount of the
metal called 'gold,' rare on the surface of the Earth; and as he had heard about
this method, invented by the future Hasnamuss Individual Harnakhoom, he
was eager to obtain gold by so easy a means.
"When this Persian king had definitely decided to obtain gold by means of
alchemy, he realized then and there with the whole of his being that he did not
yet know that 'little secret' without which it was absolutely impossible to
fulfill this desire So he began to ponder how to find out that 'little secret '
"And this pondering of his led to the following conclusion: 'Since the learned already have knowledge of every other kind of "mystery," there must be at least one of them to whom this mystery is known "Having finally reached this conclusion, he began to wonder with an
intensified functioning of 'being-astonishment' why such a simple idea had
never entered his head before and, summoning certain of his faithful subjects,
he ordered them to find out which of the learned beings of his capital knew
about this 'mystery.'
"When it was reported to him the following day that not a single one of the
learned beings of the capital knew this secret, he ordered further inquiries to
be made among learned beings of his entire realm and, when after several
days he received the same negative reply, he began once more to ponder, this
time very seriously.



"His serious reflection first led his Reason to the conclusion that one or
another of the learned beings of his community undoubtedly knew this secret
but of course, since 'professional secrecy' was strictly observed among beings
of that fraternity, nobody was willing to reveal it.
"He then realized that it was necessary not merely to question, but to put
pressure on the learned beings to compel them to reply.
"That same day, he gave appropriate instructions to his closest assistants in
such matters, and they immediately began making 'interrogations,' using
methods that had long been customary among power-possessing beings for
interrogating ordinary beings.
"And when this eccentric Persian king finally became convinced that the
learned beings of his community really knew nothing about this mystery, he
began to look in other communities for learned beings who might know about
it.
"As the kings of these other communities were unwilling to hand over their
learned beings for interrogation, he decided to compel these recalcitrant rulers
by force And so, at the head of the numerous hordes under his sway, he set off
on what are called 'military expeditions.'
"This Persian king had many hordes in subjection to him because at that
period, thanks to the 'foreseeing adaptability' of Great Nature, what is called
the 'birthrate' had increased among the beings of the part of the surface of your
planet where his kingdom was situated, moreover, at this same period, the
conditions required for the common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process were
being actualized whereby there had to issue from this region of the surface of
your planet more of those vibrations that arise from the destruction of the
existence of beings.
At this point Hassein interrupted Beelzebub with the following words:



"Dear Grandfather, I do not understand why the issuing of the vibrations
required to actualize this most great cosmic process should depend on a
particular region of the surface of the planet."
To his grandson's question Beelzebub replied: "Since before long I intend to make the problem of the terrible process of
reciprocal destruction, which they call 'war,' the theme of one of my tales
concerning the three-brained beings of the planet Earth, it is better to defer
this question of yours until this special tale, because then, I think, you will
understand it clearly."
Having said this, Beelzebub returned to his narrative about the Babylonian
events.
"When this eccentric Persian king with his subject hordes began to conquer
the beings of other communities and to carry off their learned beings by force,
he assigned the city of Babylon as a gathering place for them, and there they
were taken in order that this lord of half the continent of Asia could
interrogate them as he pleased, in the hope that one of them might happen to
know the secret of turning base metal into gold.
"With the same aim he even undertook what is called a 'campaign' into the
country of Egypt.
"And he undertook this campaign because at that period the learned beings
of all the continents were assembled there, the opinion being widely held that
more information pertaining to their various 'sciences' was available in this
Egypt than anywhere else on their planet.
"This Persian conqueror then carried off from Egypt all the learned beings
he found there, both the native ones and those from other communities, and
among their number were several Egyptian 'priests,' descendants of those
learned members of the Society of Akhldanns who, having chanced to
survive, had been the first to populate that country.
"But when a little later a new craze arose in the presence



of that eccentric Persian king, this time for the process itself of the destruction
of the existence of his fellow-beings, the new craze supplanted the former one,
and he forgot all about the learned beings, who then began to exist freely in
the city of Babylon awaiting his further instructions.
"The learned beings thus assembled from almost the whole of the planet in
the city of Babylon often used to meet together, and of course, as is proper to
'learned' beings on the planet Earth, they discussed among themselves
questions immeasurably beyond their comprehension, from which they could
never derive anything useful whatsoever, either for themselves or for the
ordinary beings there.
"Well, it was precisely during these meetings and discussions that there
arose among them, as generally happens with terrestrial learned beings, a
'burning question of the day,' which this time in some way or other stirred
them, as they say, 'to their very marrow. '
"The question that chanced to become the 'burning question of the day' so
vitally affected the whole being of every one of them that they even 'climbed
down from their pedestals' and began discussing it not only with the 'learned'
like themselves, but here, there, and everywhere, with anyone they happened
to come across.
"As a result, the interest aroused by this question gradually spread among
all the ordinary three-brained beings then existing in Babylon, and by the time
we arrived it had become the 'question of the day' for everyone there.
"Not only did the learned beings themselves talk about and discuss this
question, but similar conversations and arguments raged like fury among the
ordinary beings there also.
"It was talked about and discussed by young and old, by men and women,
and even by the Babylonian butchers.
"And all, especially the 'learned,' were exceedingly anxious to know more
about this question.



"Before our arrival there, many of the beings existing in Babylon had even
lost their Reason over it, and many others were already candidates for losing
theirs.
"This 'burning question of the day,' which both the 'sorry scientists' and the
ordinary beings of the city of Babylon wanted to resolve, was whether or not
they had a 'soul.'
"All sorts of fantastic theories about this question existed in Babylon, and
at every moment new theories were being 'cooked up'; and of course, each of
these 'catchy theories' had its devotees.
"In spite of the number and variety of these theories, they were all based
upon two quite opposite assumptions One of these was called the 'atheistic'
and the other the 'idealistic,' or 'dualistic.'
"All the dualistic theories maintained the existence of the 'soul,' and of
course its 'immortality,' as well as every conceivable 'tribulation' it might
suffer after the death of the being, man.
"And all the atheistic theories maintained just the opposite.
"In short, my boy, when we arrived in the city of Babylon, there was then
taking place what is called the 'building of the Tower of Babel.' "
Having uttered these words, Beelzebub thought a moment and went on as
follows:
"Now I wish to explain to you the expression, the 'building of the Tower
of Babel,' which I just used and which is very often used on your planet by
the contemporary three-brained beings.
"I wish to touch upon this expression and explain it to you, first because I
chanced to be a witness of all the events that gave rise to it, and second
because the history of its arising and its transformation in the understanding
of your contemporary favorites can show you very clearly that,



thanks as always to the same abnormally established conditions of ordinary
being-existence, no exact information about events that have really occurred
there among beings of former epochs ever reaches the beings of later
generations And if something like this expression does happen to reach them,
their fantastic Reason at once elaborates a whole theory on the basis of it, thus
multiplying in their presence those illusory 'being-egoplastikoori,' or what
they call 'psychic images,' thanks to which there has arisen in the Universe
that strange 'unique psyche' which every one of your favorites has.
"Well, my boy, when we arrived in Babylon and I began mingling with
various beings and making corresponding observations in order to clear up the
question that had interested me, almost everywhere I went I ran across those
learned beings who were meeting in great numbers, and I began associating
exclusively with them, confining my observations to them and to their
individualities.
"Among the learned beings whom I often met for the sake of my aim was a
certain Hamolinadir, who had been brought there under compulsion from
Egypt.
"During these meetings between this terrestrial three-brained being,
Hamolinadir, and myself, almost the same relations were established as in
general prevail between three-brained beings who often meet one another.
"This Hamohnadir was one of those learned beings in whose common
presence the factors for the impulses of a three-brained being, which had
passed to him by heredity, were not entirely atrophied, and moreover, it
turned out that during his preparatory age the responsible beings around him
had prepared him to be more or less normally responsible.
"I should add that at that time there were many such learned beings in the city of Babylon.



"Although this learned Hamolinadir was descended from the race of
beings called 'Assyrian,' and his arising and preparation for becoming a
responsible being had taken place in that very city of Babylon, his knowledge
had been acquired in Egypt, in the highest school of all those existing on the
Earth at that time, called the 'School for Materializing Thought.'
"When I first met him he was at an age when his 'I'—in the sense of
intelligently directing the 'automatic psychic functioning' of his common
presence—had already attained the maximum stability possible for a three
centered being of the planet Earth at that time, so that during what is called
his 'passive waking state' he had being-manifestations that were very clearly
expressed, such as 'consciousness of self,' 'impartiality,' 'sincerity,'
'sensitivity,' 'resourcefulness,' and so forth.
"Shortly after our arrival in Babylon, I began going with this Hamolinadir
to various 'meetings' of the learned beings I have mentioned, where I listened
to every imaginable kind of what they called 'report' upon the very subject
that was then the 'question of the day' and the cause of such 'agitation of
minds' throughout Babylon.
"My friend Hamolinadir was also very wrought up about this burning
question.
"He was agitated and perplexed by the fact that the numerous theories on
this subject, the new as well as the old, were all, in spite of their entirely
contradictory proofs, equally plausible and convincing.
"The theories proving that we have a soul, he said, were very logically and
convincingly expounded, but equally logical and convincing were those
proving quite the contrary.
"So that you can put yourself in the place of that likable Assyrian, I shall
explain to you that in general on your planet—then in Babylon as well as at
the present time—all the theories on a question such as that of the 'beyond, or



any other 'detailed clarification' of some particular fact, are nearly always
invented by those three-brained beings in whom most of the consequences of
the properties of the organ kundabuffer have been completely crystallized, so
that there actively functions in their presence that being-property they call
'cunning ' Owing to this, either consciously, of course with that sort of Reason
which they alone possess, or automatically, that is of itself, they gradually
acquire in their common presence the capacity for 'spotting the weak-nesses'
in the psyche of beings like themselves, and this capacity gradually forms
data in them for the ability to sense and at times even to understand the
peculiar logic of the beings around them, and according to these data they
invent and elaborate some 'theory' concerning this or that question And as I
have already told you, because of the gradual atrophy of the being-function
called the 'instinctive sensing of cosmic truths' in most of the three-brained
beings there— also owing to the abnormal conditions of ordinary being
existence established by them—if one of them happens to devote himself to
an intensive study of any of these theories, he is bound willy-nilly to be
convinced by it with the whole of his presence.
"Well, my boy, seven of their months after our arrival in the city of Babylon I
went one day with my friend Hamolinadir to what is called a general
scientific 'conference. '
"This scientific conference had been convened by the learned beings
previously brought there 'under compulsion' by the Persian king, who had
meanwhile got over his craze for the science of alchemy and forgotten all
about it, and there were also present at this conference many other learned
beings from other communities, who had come there voluntarily, as they said,
'for the love of science.'
"At this general scientific conference that day, the order of speakers was determined by lot.



"My friend Hamolinadir was among those who were to report on various topics, and therefore drew a lot, it fell to him to speak fifth. "Of the speakers who preceded him, some reported on new 'theories' they had invented, while others criticized theories already established and well known to everybody.
"At last came the turn of this likable Assyrian. "He mounted what is called the 'rostrum,' and as he did so some attendants
hung a placard above it announcing the subject of the speech to be given, as
was the custom at that time.
"The placard stated that the speaker had chosen as his theme the 'instability of human Reason. '
"This terrestrial friend of mine began by explaining the structure, as he understood it, of the human 'head-brain' and in what cases and in what manner various impressions are perceived by the other brains of man, and how it is only after a definite 'agreement' among all the brains that the total results are impressed on the 'head-brain. ' "At first he spoke calmly, but the longer he spoke, the more agitated he became, until his voice rose to a shout as he began to criticize the 'Reason' in man. "At the same time, he mercilessly criticized his own Reason. "Still continuing to shout, he very logically and convincingly
demonstrated the instability and fickleness of human Reason, giving various
examples of how easy it is to persuade and convince this Reason of anything
you like.
"Although in the midst of the shouting of this terrestrial friend of mine,
Hamolinadir, the sound of his sobbing could be heard, nevertheless, even
while sobbing, he continued to shout:
'To every man, and also of course to me, it is quite easy to prove anything whatever, all you need to know is which



shocks and which associations to arouse in the various brains while one or
another "truth" is being proved It is even easy to prove to a man that our
whole world and all the people in it are nothing but an illusion, and that the
authenticity and reality of the world are nothing but a "corn," and what is
more, the corn on the big toe of his left foot Apart from this corn, nothing in
the world exists, everything only "seems," and even then only to "psychopaths
squared. " '
"At this point in the speech of this likable terrestrial three-brained being, an
attendant offered him a bowl of water, and after he had eagerly gulped it
down, he continued to speak, but now more calmly.
"He said further: " 'Take myself as an example I am not just an ordinary learned man I am
known all over Babylon and in many other cities as an exceedingly learned
and wise man.
" 'I completed the highest course of study that has ever existed on Earth,
and the like of which will probably never exist again.
" 'But what has this highest development given my Reason with respect to
that question which, for the past year or two, has been driving all Babylon
insane?
'During this general dementia over the question of the "soul," this
Reason of mine, in spite of its high development, has brought me nothing but
"five Fridays a week. "
'Over this period, I have followed with the greatest attention and utmost
seriousness all the old and new theories about the "soul," and there is not a
single one of them with whose author I do not inwardly agree, for all these
theories are very logically and plausibly expounded, and such Reason as I
have cannot but agree with their logic and plausibility. 'I myself have written
a very lengthy work on this "question of the beyond" and no doubt many of
those present are familiar with the logic of my thought, and probably



there is not one of you here who does not envy this logical thinking of mine.
" 'Yet now, I honestly and sincerely declare before you all that,
regarding this "question of the beyond," I, with all the knowledge
accumulated in me, am neither more nor less than an "idiot cubed."
" 'At this moment in the city of Babylon what is taking place among us is
the collective building of a tower by which to ascend to Heaven and see with
our own eyes what goes on there.
" 'This tower is being built of bricks that outwardly all look alike, but that
are made of quite different materials.
'Among these bricks are bricks of "iron" and "wood," and also of "dough," and even some of "eider-down." " 'Well then, with these bricks an immensely high tower is now being built
right in the center of Babylon, and every more or less conscious person must
realize that sooner or later this tower is certain to fall and crush not only all
the people of Babylon but also everything else there.
" 'Personally, as I still wish to live, and have no desire to be crushed by the
Babylonian tower, I am going away from here at once . . . And as for all the
rest of you, do as you please!'
"He uttered these last words while leaving, and ran off. "And from that time, I never saw that likable Assyrian again.
"As I learned later, he left the city of Babylon that same day forever, and
went to 'Nineveh' and existed somewhere there to a ripe old age I also
ascertained that this Hamolinadir never again occupied himself with 'sciences'
and spent the rest of his existence in growing 'choongary,' which in
contemporary language is called 'maize.'
"Well, my boy, the speech of this Hamolinadir at first made such a deep
impression upon the beings there that for almost



a month they went about, as is said, 'down in the mouth. ' "And when they met one another, they could speak of nothing else, but only recalled and repeated various passages from his speech. "They repeated them so often that certain of Hamolinadir's expressions spread among the ordinary beings of Babylon and became what are called 'household sayings.' "Some of these sayings have even reached contemporary beings of the planet Earth, and among these is the 'building of the Tower of Babel ' "So the beings of today picture to themselves quite clearly that once upon a time a certain tower was built in this city of Babylon to enable beings to ascend in their planetary bodies to God Himself. "And the contemporary beings also say, and are even quite persuaded, that during the building of this Babylonian tower a confusion of tongues occurred. "In general, there have reached the contemporary beings of the planet Earth a great many such isolated expressions, uttered by various beings with Reason of former epochs, both from the time when Babylon was the center of culture and from other epochs, concerning some details of a whole understanding, and simply on the basis of these 'scraps,' your favorites of recent centuries, with their quite nonsensical Reason, have cooked up such balderdash as our arch-cunning Lucifer himself might envy.
"As I already told you, among the many teachings then current in Babylon concerning the 'question of the beyond,' there were two, having nothing in common with each other, that had a large number of adherents. "And it was precisely these two teachings, passing from generation to generation of your favorites, which began to confuse their 'sane beingmentation,' already muddled enough without that.



"Although the details of both these teachings underwent changes in the
course of their transmission through the generations, the fundamental ideas
contained in them remained the same and have even reached contemporary
times.
"One of these two teachings with adherents in Babylon was the 'dualistic,'
and the other, the 'atheistic', thus one of them proved that beings have a 'soul,'
and the other, quite the opposite, namely, that they have nothing of the kind.
"In the 'dualistic,' or 'idealistic,' teaching it was said that within the coarse
body of the being-man there is a fine and invisible body, which is the 'soul.'
"This 'fine body' of man is immortal, that is to say, it is never destroyed. "It was said further that this 'fine body,' or 'soul,' has to make a
corresponding payment for every action of the 'physical body,' whether
voluntary or involuntary, and that every man, at birth, already consists of
these two bodies, the 'physical body' and the 'soul. '
"According to this teaching, as soon as a man is born, two invisible 'spirits'
perch upon his shoulders.
"On his right shoulder sits a 'spirit of good' called an 'angel,' and on his
left, a 'spirit of evil' called a 'devil. '
"From the very first day these spirits record in their 'notebooks' all the
manifestations of the man, the spirit sitting on his right shoulder recording all
his so-called 'good manifestations' or 'good deeds,' and the spirit sitting on his
left shoulder, his 'evil' ones.
"It is among the duties of these two spirits to prompt a man and compel
him to carry out as many manifestations as possible in their respective
domains.
"The spirit on the right constantly strives to make the man refrain from
those acts which are in the domain of the opposite spirit, and perform as many
acts as possible in his own domain.



"And the spirit on the left does the same thing, but vice versa.
"In this strange teaching it was further said that these two rival spirits are
always contending with each other, and that each strives with 'might and
main' to make the man perform more of those actions which are under his
charge.
"When the man dies, these spirits leave his 'physical body' on the Earth
and take his 'soul' to 'God,' who exists somewhere 'up in Heaven.'
"There 'up in Heaven' this 'God' sits surrounded by His devoted angels and
archangels, with a pair of 'scales' suspended in front of him.
"On each side of the scales spirits stand on duty On the right stand the
spirits who are called 'servants of Paradise,' and these are the 'angels', and on
the left stand the 'servants of Hell'—these are the 'devils. '
"The spirits who have been sitting on the man's shoulders all his life bring
his 'soul' after death to 'God', and 'God' then takes from their hands the
'notebooks' where the notes of all the man's actions have been written down,
and places them on the pans of the scales.
"On the right pan He puts the notebook of the angel and on the left the
notebook of the devil and, depending on which pan sinks lower, 'God'
commands the spirits on duty on that side to take this 'soul' into their charge.
"In the charge of the spirits on duty on the right is the place called
'Paradise.'
"This 'Paradise' is a realm of indescribable beauty and splendiferousness. It
abounds in magnificent fruits, and innumerable fragrant flowers. Enchanting
sounds of cherubic songs and seraphic music constantly echo in the air. And
many other marvels were enumerated whose outer effects, according to the
perceptions and cognitions abnormally inherent in the three-brained beings of
that strange planet,



were likely to evoke, as they say, 'great satisfaction' in them, that is, the
satisfaction of those needs that are unworthy of three-centered beings, which
drive from their presence everything, without exception, that was put into it by
our Common Father which is imperative for every three-brained being to
possess.
"The spirits on duty to the left of the scales, who, according to this
Babylonian teaching, are the 'devils,' are in charge of what is called 'Hell.'
"As for 'Hell,' it was said to be a place without a trace of vegetation, always unimaginably hot, and without a single drop of water. "In this 'Hell' there constantly echo sounds of frightful 'cacophony' and
furious 'insults.'
"All around stand instruments of torture of every conceivable sort, from the
'rack' and 'wheel' to machines for 'lacerating bodies' and rubbing them with
salt, and so on and so forth.
"In this Babylonian 'idealistic' teaching, it was explained in detail that for
his 'soul' to enter 'Paradise,' a man must constantly strive while on Earth to
provide as much material as possible for the 'notebook' of the spirit-angel
perched on his right shoulder, since otherwise there would be more material
for the record of the spirit on his left shoulder, in which case his soul would
inevitably be cast into that most awful 'Hell. ' "
Here Hassein could restrain himself no longer, and suddenly interrupted
Beelzebub with the following words:
"And which of their manifestations do they consider good and which bad?" Beelzebub gave his grandson a very strange look and, shaking his head,
replied:
"As regards the question of which being-manifestations are considered good on your planet, and which bad, two



distinct ways of understanding, having nothing in common, have existed from the most ancient times up to the present day. "The first way of understanding exists there and passes from one generation to another through such three-brained beings as were the members of the learned Society of Akhldanns on the continent of Atlantis, and through such as those who, several centuries later, after the second transapalnian perturbation, were beginning, although in a different manner, to acquire almost the same data in the foundation of their common presence, and who were called 'initiates.'
"This way of understanding is expressed there as follows: 'Every deed of a man is good in the objective sense if it is done according to his conscience, and every deed is bad if from it he later experiences remorse. "And the second way of understanding arose soon after the 'wise invention'
of the great King Koniutsion, and, passing from generation to generation
through ordinary beings there, it gradually spread over almost the entire planet
under the name of 'morality. '
"Here it will be interesting to note one particularity of this morality which was grafted on to it at the very beginning, and ultimately became part and parcel of it. "Just what this particularity of terrestrial 'morality' is you can easily
represent to yourself and understand if I tell you that, both inwardly and
outwardly, it has acquired the unique property that belongs to the being named
'chameleon.'
"And the strangest and most original aspect of this particularity of the 'morality' there, especially of the contemporary 'morality,' is that its functioning automatically depends on the moods of the 'local authorities', and these moods in their turn depend, also automatically, on the state of the four sources of action existing there under the names of 'mother-in-law,' 'digestion,' 'John Thomas,' and 'cash. '



"The second Babylonian teaching, which had many followers and, passing
through the generations also reached your contemporary favorites, was based
on one of the atheistic theories of that period.
"In this teaching of the terrestrial hasnamussian candidates of that time, it
was stated over and over again that there is no 'God' in the world, much less
any 'soul' in man, and that therefore all the arguments and discussions about
the 'soul' are nothing but the delirium of sick visionaries.
"It was further maintained that there exists in the world only one particular
law of mechanics, according to which everything that exists passes from one
form into another, that is to say, the results arising from any preceding causes
are progressively transformed and become the causes of subsequent results.
"And therefore man also is a result of some preceding cause and in his turn
must serve as the cause of some kind of result.
"Moreover, it was said that all 'supernatural' phenomena—even those
actually perceptible to most people— are also nothing but results ensuing
from this particular law of mechanics.
"The full comprehension of this law depends on the progressive, impartial,
and all-round knowledge of its manifold details, which can be revealed to a
pure Reason in proportion to its development.
"But as regards the Reason of man, this is merely the sum of all the
impressions he has perceived, from which there gradually arise in him data for
the possibility of comparisons, deductions, and conclusions.
"As a result of all this, he obtains more information concerning various
facts around him repeatedly occurring in the same way, which in their turn
serve in the general organization of man as material for the formation of
definite con



victions. And from all this is formed man's Reason, that is to say, his own subjective psyche.
"Whatever may have been said in these two teachings about the 'soul,' and
whatever maleficent means were prepared by those 'learned' beings,
assembled there from almost the entire planet, for the gradual transformation
of the Reason of their descendants into a veritable 'mill of nonsense,' the out
come need not have been, in the objective sense, a total calamity, but the full
objective terror lay in the fact that there later resulted from these teachings a
great evil, not only for their descendants, but maybe even for everything that
exists.
"The point is that during this great 'agitation of minds' in the city of
Babylon, when these learned beings, through their collective wiseacrings, had
acquired in their presences a mass of new data for hasnamussian
manifestations—in addition to those they already had—and when they
dispersed and went home to their own countries, they began, of course
unconsciously, to propagate everywhere, like contagious bacilli, all those
notions which together finally and utterly destroyed the last remnants and
even the traces of the results of the holy labors of the Very Saintly Ashiata
Shiemash.
the remnants, that is to say, of those holy labors, 'consciously suffered,' which
he intentionally actualized in order to create the special external conditions of
ordinary being-existence in which alone the maleficent consequences of the
properties of the organ kundabuffer could gradually disappear from the
presence of your favorites, so that in their place there could gradually be
acquired those properties befitting every three-brained being—whose whole
presence is an exact likeness of the whole Universe.
"Another result of the diverse wiseacrings on the 'question of the soul' by those 'learned' beings in the city of Babylon was that, soon after my fifth appearance in person on the



surface of your planet, this 'center of culture' of theirs, the incomparable and
indeed magnificent Babylon, was in its turn, as is said there, 'completely
swept from the face of the Earth,' down to its very foundations.
"Not only was the city of Babylon itself destroyed but also everything
acquired and accomplished by the beings who had existed there for many of
their centuries.
"In the name of justice I must say here that the prime initiative for the
destruction of the holy labors of Ashiata Shiemash did not spring from those
learned terrestrial beings then assembled in the city of Babylon, but rather
from the invention of a well-known 'learned' being who had existed on the
continent of Asia several centuries before these Babylonian events His name
was Lentrohamsanin, and this being, whose highest being-part was coated
into a definite unit and perfected to the required gradation of Objective
Reason, became one of those 313 Eternal Hasnamuss Individuals who now
exist on the small planet bearing the name of 'Retribution. '
"I shall tell you more about this Lentrohamsanin, since the information
about him will help you to understand better the strange psyche of those
three-brained beings who exist on that peculiar remote planet.
"But I shall speak of Lentrohamsanin only after I have told you all about
the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, since the information about this now
Most Saintly Individual and his activities in relation to this planet of yours is
of the utmost importance and value for deepening your understanding of the
strangeness of the psyche of the three-brained beings who please you and who
breed on the planet Earth. "



CHAPTER 25
The Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash sent from
Above to the Earth
" AND so, my boy! "Now listen very attentively to the information I will give you about the Very
Saintly, now Common-Cosmic Individual, Ashiata Shiemash, and his ac
tivities connected with the three-brained beings arising and existing on that
planet Earth which has taken your fancy.
"I have already told you more than once that, by the all-gracious command
of our Infinitely Loving Common Father Endlessness, our Highest and Most
Saintly Cosmic Individuals sometimes actualize within the presence of some
terrestrial three-brained being the 'definitized conception' of a Sacred
Individual, in order that, having become a terrestrial being with such a
presence, he might comprehend the situation on the spot and give a suitable
new direction to the process of the ordinary being-existence of your favorites,
thanks to which there could perhaps be removed from their presences the
already crystallized consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer,
as well as the predisposition to new crystallizations.
"It was just seven centuries before the Babylonian events of which I have
spoken that there was actualized in the planetary body of a three-brained being
there the 'definitized conception' of a Sacred Individual named Ashiata
Shiemash, who became in his turn a Messenger from Above, and who is now
one of the Highest and Most Saintly Common-Cosmic Sacred Individuals.
"The conception of Ashiata Shiemash took its form in the planetary body
of a boy of poor family descended from what



is called the 'Sumerian race,' in a small village called 'Pispascana," situated
not far from Babylon.
"He grew up and became a responsible being partly in this village and
partly in Babylon itself which, although not yet magnificent at that time, was
already a famous city.
"The Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash was the only Messenger sent from
Above to your planet who by his holy labors succeeded in creating conditions
in which for a certain time the existence of its unfortunate beings somewhat
resembled the existence of three-brained beings with the same possibilities
that inhabit other planets of our Great Universe And this saint was also the
first who, for the accomplishment of the mission assigned to him, refused to
employ the customary methods established during centuries by all the other
Messengers from Above for the three-brained beings of that planet.
"The Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash taught nothing whatever to the
ordinary three-brained beings of the Earth, nor did he preach anything to
them, as was done before and after him by all the other Messengers sent from
Above with the same aim.
"And in consequence of this, none of his teachings in any form passed
from his contemporaries even to the third generation there, let alone to
contemporary beings.
"Definite information relating to his very saintly activities did, however,
pass from the contemporaries of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash to the
beings of following generations through those known as 'initiates,' by means
of a certain 'legomonism' of his deliberations under the title of 'The Terror of
the Situation.'
"In addition to this, there has been preserved from the period of his very
saintly activities, and exists even to the present day, a 'marble tablet' on which
were engraved his 'counsels' and 'commandments' to the beings of that time.
"And this tablet, which has remained intact, is now the



most precious sacred relic of a small group of initiated beings called the
'Olbogmek Brotherhood,' whose place of existence is in the middle of the
continent of Asia.
"The name 'Olbogmek' means, 'There are no different religions, there is only one God. "On my last visit in person to the surface of your planet, I happened to
become acquainted with this legomonism, which transmitted to the initiated
beings of remote generations of the planet Earth the deliberations of the
Saintly Ashiata Shiemash under the title of 'The Terror of the Situation. '
"This legomonism was of great help to me in elucidating certain strange
aspects of the psyche of these peculiar beings, which until then I had been
unable to understand at all, in spite of my careful observations of them during
tens of centuries.
"Dear, beloved Grandfather, tell me, please, what does the word
'legomonism' mean?" asked Hassein.
"Legomonism," Beelzebub replied, "is the name given to one of the means
used there for transmitting from generation to generation information about
certain events of long-past ages through those three-brained beings who have
become worthy to be, and to be called, 'initiates.'
"This means of transmitting information had been devised by the beings of the continent of Atlantis. "For your better understanding of how information can be transmitted to
beings of succeeding generations by means of a legomonism, I must tell you a
little about those beings whom other beings there call 'initiates.'
"In former times on the planet Earth, this word was used in one sense only those three-brained beings were called 'initiates' who had acquired in their presences almost identical objective data, which could be sensed by other beings. "But during the last two centuries this word has come to have two different
meanings.



"According to the first meaning it is used, as in the past, to designate those
beings who become 'initiates' thanks to their personal, conscious labor and
intentional suffering, and who thus acquire in themselves, as I have already
told you, objective merits that are perceptible to other beings of any brain
system and that evoke trust and respect.
"In the other meaning, this word is used as a title conferred upon one
another by those beings belonging to what are called 'robber gangs,' which
have greatly multiplied there during this period and whose members have as
their principal aim to 'steal' from those around them only 'essence-values. '
"Under the pretence of following 'supernatural' or 'occult' sciences, these
'robber gangs' are really occupied, and very successfully, with this kind of
'plunder.'
"And so, any and every regular member of such a gang calls himself an
'initiate.'
"Among these terrestrial 'initiates of new formation' there are even 'great
initiates,' and these 'great initiates' are those who, especially at the present
time, in the course of their virtuoso enterprises, go through 'fire, water,
copper pipes, and even through all the roulette halls of Monte Carlo.
"Well then, my boy, 'legomonism' is the name given to the successive
transmission of information about long-past events on the planet Earth from
initiate to initiate of the first kind, that is, between really meritorious beings,
transmitting what they themselves have received from similar meritorious
beings.
"For this means of transmitting information we must give the beings of the
continent of Atlantis their due, it was a very wise device and did indeed attain
their aim.
"It is in fact the sole means by which information about certain events of
long ago has accurately reached beings of later generations.
"As for the information that passes from generation to



generation through the mass of ordinary beings of that planet, either it disappears and is completely forgotten or, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin says, all that is left of it is 'skin and bones and tales for Scheherazade.' "Hence it is that when a few scraps of information about some event or other do happen to reach the beings of remote generations, and the 'learned beings of new formation' concoct their hodge-podge out of these scraps, a most peculiar and instructive phenomenon occurs when all the 'cockroaches' hear what is in this hodge-podge, the 'evil spirit of Saint Vitus' immediately enters their common presences and dances to his heart's content. "As for the way in which the contemporary learned beings of the planet
Earth concoct their hodge-podge from scraps of information that reach them,
this is very well defined in one of the wise sayings of our dear Mullah Nasr
Eddin, consisting of the following words:
" 'A flea has been put into the world for just one thing— that when it
sneezes that deluge is released which our learned beings so dearly love to
describe.'
"I must tell you that when I used to exist among your favorites, it was sometimes almost impossible for me to keep from 'bursting out laughing,' as they would say, when one or another of the 'learned' beings there delivered a lecture or told me personally about some past events of which I myself had been an eyewitness. "These lectures and 'stones' are full of such comical fictions that neither our arch-cunning Lucifer nor his aides could have invented them, even if they wanted to.



CHAPTER 26
The legomonism concerning the deliberations of the
Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash under the title of
"The Terror of the Situation"
"THE LEGOMONISM," Beelzebub continued, "through which the deliberations of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash were transmitted began with the following prayer: 'In the name of the Cause of my arising, I will always strive to be just toward every already spiritualized source and toward all sources of future spiritualized manifestations of our Common Creator, Almighty Autocrat Endlessness Amen. " 'To me, a trifling particle of the whole of the Great Whole, it was commanded from Above to be coated with the planetary body of a threecentered being of the Earth in order to help all other such beings arising and existing upon it to free themselves from the consequences of the properties of that organ which, for great and important reasons, was implanted in the presence of their ancestors. " 'All the Sacred Individuals before me who were intentionally actualized from Above, while striving for this same aim, have always endeavored to accomplish the task laid upon them through one or another of the three sacred ways for self-perfecting foreordained by our Endless Creator Himself, that is, through the sacred ways based on the being-impulses called "Faith," "Hope," and "Love. " 'When I had completed my seventeenth year, I began, as commanded from Above, to prepare my planetary body in order, during my responsible existence, to be able to be impartial.
'During this period of my self-preparation it was also



my intention that as soon as I reached responsible age, I would carry out the task laid upon me through one or another of these three sacred being-impulses. " 'But when during this period of self-preparation I chanced to meet many
beings of almost all "types" who existed here in the city of Babylon, and
when in the course of my impartial observations I became aware of various
traits of their being-manifestations, there crept into me and progressively
increased an essence-doubt as to the possibility of saving the three-centered
beings of this planet by any of these three sacred ways.
" 'The different manifestations of the beings I encountered not only
increased my doubt, but gradually convinced me that the consequences of the
properties of the organ kundabuffer, having passed by heredity through many
generations over a very long period, had ultimately so crystallized in their
presence that they have reached contemporary beings as a lawful part of their
essence, and thus these crystallized consequences of the properties of the
organ kundabuffer are now, as it were, a "second nature" of their common
presence.
" 'So, when I finally became a responsible being, before making my choice
of one of the three sacred ways, I decided to bring my planetary body into the
state of the sacred "ksherknara," that is, into the state of "all-brains-balanced
being-perceptiveness," and only in that state to choose the way for my future
activities.
'With this aim I then ascended "Mount Veziniama," where for forty days
and nights I knelt on my knees and devoted myself to concentration.
" 'For a second forty days and nights I neither ate nor drank, but recalled
and analyzed all the impressions present in me of everything I had perceived
during my existence here in the period of my self-preparation.
" 'A third forty days and nights I remained on my knees



and neither ate nor drank, and every half hour I plucked two hairs from my
breast.
'And it was only when I had finally attained complete freedom from the
influence of all bodily and spiritual associations linked with the impressions
of ordinary life that I began to ponder what I was to do.
'This pondering of my purified Reason then brought me to the certainty that
it was already too late to save the contemporary beings by any of the three
sacred ways.
'This pondering of mine also made it categorically clear to me that all
the genuine functions proper to men-beings —as they are proper to all three
centered beings of our Great Universe—had already degenerated in their
remote ancestors into quite other functions, which were included among the
properties of the organ kundabuffer, and were very similar to the genuine
sacred being-functions of Faith, Hope, and Love.
'And in all probability this degeneration was due to the fact that when
the organ kundabuffer had been destroyed in their ancestors, and they had
acquired in themselves factors for the genuine sacred being-impulses, then, as
the taste of many of the properties of the organ kundabuffer still remained in
them, these properties resembling the three sacred impulses gradually became
mixed with the genuine ones, and as a result, factors were crystallized in their
psyche for the impulses of "faith," "hope," and "love," which although similar
to the genuine were somehow or other quite peculiar.
" 'The contemporary three-centered beings also at times believe, love, and
hope both with their Reason and with their feelings, but how they believe,
how they love, and how they hope—in this lies all the peculiarity of these
three being-properties of theirs!



" 'They also believe, but in them this sacred impulse does not function independently, as it does in general in all the three-centered beings with the same possibilities on the various other planets of our Great Universe, but its arising is dependent upon certain factors that have been formed in their common presence, owing as always to the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer—as, for instance, those peculiar properties arising in them which they call "vanity," "self-love," "pride," "self-importance," and so forth. " 'In consequence of this, the three-brained beings of the Earth are
particularly subject to the perception and fixation in their presence of all sorts
of "sinkrpoosarams" or, as it is expressed here, they "believe any old twaddle."
" 'It is very easy to convince a being of this planet of anything you like, provided that during his perception of this nonsense there is evoked in him, either consciously from without or automatically by itself, the functioning of one or another corresponding consequence of the properties of the organ kundabuffer crystallized in him from among those forming what is called his "subjectivity," as for instance "self-love," "vanity," "pride," "swagger," "presumptuousness," "arrogance," and so on. " 'If these influences act upon their degenerate Reason and upon the
equally degenerate factors in their localizations— factors that actualize being
sensations—not only is a false conviction crystallized in them concerning the
aforementioned nonsense, but they will even, in all sincerity and faith, prove
vehemently to those around them that it is just so and can in no way be
otherwise.
" 'In an equally abnormal form data have been molded in them for evoking the sacred impulse of Love.



" 'In the presence of the beings of contemporary times there is as much as
you please of that strange impulse they call "love", but this "love" of theirs is
also the result of certain crystallized consequences of the properties of the or
gan kundabuffer, and this impulse arises and manifests itself in the presence
of every one of them entirely subjectively— so subjectively and so differently
that if ten of them were asked to explain how they sense this inner impulse of
theirs, all of them—if, of course, they for once replied sincerely, and frankly
acknowledged their genuine sensations and not those they had read about
somewhere or heard about from someone else—all ten would reply differently
and describe ten different sensations.
" 'One would explain this sensation in the sexual sense, another in the sense
of pity, a third as a desire for submission, a fourth, a common interest in outer
things, and so on and so forth, but not one of the ten could describe, even re
motely, the sensation of genuine Love.
" 'And none of them could describe it, because for a long time now none of
the ordinary men-beings here has ever had any sensation of the sacred being
impulse of genuine Love And without this "taste" they cannot have the
faintest idea of that sacred being-impulse, the most beatific in the presence of
every three-centered being of the Universe, which, in accordance with the
divine foresight of Great Nature, forms in us such data that, when we
experience their results, we can rest in bliss from the meritorious labors we
have fulfilled for the purpose of self-perfection.
'Nowadays, if one of these three-brained beings "loves" somebody or
other, it is either because this somebody always encourages and undeservedly
flatters him, or because this one's nose is very like the nose of that female or
male with whom, thanks to the cosmic law of "polarity" or "type," a
relationship has been established that has not yet been broken, or finally, he
"loves" someone only because this



someone's uncle is in business in a big way and may one day give him a boost, and so on and so forth. " 'But never do men-beings here love with genuine, impartial, and non
egoistic love.
" 'Thanks to the kind of love that exists in the contemporary beings here, their hereditary predisposition to the crystallization of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer now proceeds in them without hindrance, and becomes definitely fixed as a lawful part of their nature.
'And as regards the third sacred being-impulse, Essence-Hope, its plight in the presence of the three-centered beings here is even worse than that of the first two. " 'Not only has this being-impulse, in its distorted form, finally adapted itself to the whole of their presence but this newly formed, maleficent "hope," which has taken the place of the being-impulse of sacred Hope, is now the principal reason why factors can no longer be acquired in them for the functioning of the genuine being-impulses of Faith, Hope, and Love. " 'In consequence of this newly formed, abnormal "hope" of theirs, they always hope for something, and this constantly paralyzes all the possibilities that appear in them, whether evoked intentionally from without or arising accidentally within them—possibilities that could perhaps still destroy in their presence their hereditary predisposition to the crystallization of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer.
" 'When I returned from Mount Vezniama to the city of Babylon, I continued
my observations in order to discover whether it would be possible to help
these unfortunates in some other way.
" 'And in the course of a year of special observations of all their manifestations and perceptions, I made it categor



ically clear to myself that although the factors for engendering in their presence the sacred being-impulses of Faith, Love, and Hope have completely degenerated in the beings of this planet, nevertheless, the factor that should engender that being-impulse on which, in general, the whole psyche of beings of a three-brained system is based, namely, the impulse existing under the name of "Objective Conscience," is not yet atrophied in them, and remains in their presence almost in its primordial state. " 'Thanks to the abnormally established conditions of ordinary external being-existence here, this factor gradually sank into that consciousness of theirs which they call the "subconscious," and as a result, it takes no part whatever in the functioning of their ordinary consciousness. " 'Well, I then understood beyond all doubt, with all the separate ruminating parts making up the whole of my "I," that only if this being-factor still surviving in their common presence were to participate in the general functioning of the consciousness under whose direction they pass their daily, as they call it, "waking existence"—only then would it be possible to save the contemporary terrestrial three-brained beings from the consequences of the properties of that organ which was intentionally implanted in their first ancestors. 'My further pondering confirmed that this could be attained only if their
ordinary being-existence were to flow for a long time under fully foreseen,
corresponding conditions.
'When these deliberations had been completely transubstantiated in me, I decided to consecrate the whole of myself from that time forward solely to the creation of such conditions here that the functioning of sacred Conscience, still surviving in their subconscious, might gradually pass into the functioning of their ordinary consciousness.
" 'May the blessing of our Almighty, Infinitely Loving



Common Father, Uni-Being, Endless Creator be upon my decision. Amen!' "Thus ended the legomonism concerning the deliberations of the Very Saintly and Incomparable Ashiata Shiemash, under the title of 'The Terror of the Situation.'
"So, my boy, when early in my last sojourn on the surface of your planet I first learned the details of this legomonism which I have just repeated, I at once became interested in the deductions of this later Most High, Very Saintly Common-Cosmic Individual, Ashiata Shiemash, and since there existed no other legomonism nor any other source of information concerning his further very saintly activities among those favorites of yours, I resolved to investigate in detail and make entirely clear to myself what measures he had taken and how he had carried them out in order to help these unfortunates to free themselves from the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, which had passed to them by heredity and were so maleficent for them. "And so, as one of my chief tasks during this last sojourn of mine on the surface of your planet, I made a detailed investigation and elucidation of the further very saintly activities among your favorites of the Great EssenceLoving, now Most High, Very Saintly Common-Cosmic Individual, Ashiata Shiemash. "As regards the 'marble tablet' that by chance remained intact since the time of the very saintly activities of the Great Ashiata Shiemash, and is today the principal sacred relic of the brotherhood of initiated beings called the 'Olbogmek Brotherhood,' I happened, during this last stay of mine on your planet, to see and read what was engraved on it. "In the course of my subsequent investigations it turned out that, later on, when this Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash had established the particular conditions of ordinary being-existence he had planned, several of these tablets, on his



advice and initiative, were set up in appropriate places in many of the large towns, and upon them were engraved all kinds of precepts and counsels for a corresponding existence. "But later, when their big wars began again, all these tablets were destroyed by these strange beings themselves, with the exception of that one which has somehow remained intact, as I have already told you, and is now the property of this brotherhood. "On this surviving marble tablet was engraved an inscription concerning the sacred being-impulses called 'Faith,' 'Love,' and 'Hope,' which was as follows:
FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE
Faith of consciousness is freedom Faith of feeling is weakness Faith of body is stupidity
Love of consciousness evokes the same in response Love of feeling evokes the opposite Love of body depends only on type and polarity
Hope of consciousness is strength Hope of feeling is slavery Hope of body is disease
"Before telling you more about the activities of the Very Saintly Ashiata
Shiemash for the welfare of your favorites, I must, I think, clarify for you at
somewhat greater length the inner impulse they call 'hope,' about which the
Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash remarked that its case is even worse than that
of the other two.
"And the special observations and investigations I made later in regard to this strange and abnormal impulse clearly showed me that the factors engendering it in their presence are, in truth, most maleficent for them



"Thanks to this abnormal hope of theirs, a singular and very curious
disease, with the property of evolving, arose and exists among them even
until now—a disease called 'tomorrow.'
"This strange disease, 'tomorrow,' has brought the most terrifying results,
particularly for those unfortunate three-brained beings there who chance to
learn, and become categorically convinced with the whole of their presence,
that they possess some very undesirable consequences, and that in order to be
delivered from these consequences it is indispensable for them to make
certain efforts, which they even know just how to make but never succeed in
making, on account of this maleficent disease, 'tomorrow.'
"And indeed, that is just the maleficent part of this terrifying evil which,
owing to various causes great and small, is concentrated in the process of the
ordinary being-existence of these pitiable three-brained beings—that by
putting off 'from tomorrow till tomorrow,' even those unfortunate beings who
do by chance learn about all that I have mentioned are also deprived of the
possibility of ever attaining anything real.
"This disease, 'tomorrow,' so maleficent for your favorites, has become an
obstacle for contemporary beings not only because it totally deprives them of
all possibility of removing from their presence the crystallized consequences
of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, but also because it hinders most of
them in honestly discharging even those being-obligations of theirs that are
quite indispensable in the established conditions of ordinary being-existence.
"Thanks to this disease, 'tomorrow,' the three-brained beings there,
particularly the contemporary ones, almost always put off 'until later'
everything that needs to be done at the moment, being convinced that 'later'
they will do better and more.
"Even those unfortunates who, either by chance or owing



to a conscious action from outside, become aware through their Reason of
their complete nullity and begin to sense it with all their separate spiritualized
parts, and who happen to learn what being-efforts must be made, and how to
make them, in order to become such as is proper for three-brained beings to
be—even these beings, by putting off 'from tomorrow till tomorrow,' almost
all arrive at the point that one sorrowful day there arise and are manifest in
them those forerunners of old age called 'feebleness' and 'infirmity,' which are
the inevitable lot of all cosmic formations, great and small, toward the end of
their completed existence.
"Here I must not fail to tell you about the strange phenomenon I noted
during my observations and studies of the almost entirely degenerate presence
of those favorites of yours—that is to say, I definitely established that in many
of them, toward the end of their planetary existence, most of the consequences
of the properties of the organ kundabuffer crystallized in their common
presence atrophy of their own accord, and some of them even entirely
disappear, thanks to which these beings begin to see and sense reality a little
better.
"In such cases there appears in the common presence of these favorites of
yours a strong desire to work upon themselves—to work, as they say, for the
'salvation of their souls.'
"But needless to say, nothing can result from such desires of theirs simply
because it is already too late, the time allotted them for this purpose by Great
Nature having already passed, and although they see and feel the necessity of
making the required being-efforts, yet for the fulfillment of these desires they
now have only 'ineffectual yearnings' and the 'lawful infirmities' of old age.
"Well, my boy, my research and investigations concerning the further activities of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash



for the welfare of the three-brained beings arising and existing on this planet of yours made the following clear to me. "When this great, and as regards his Reason almost incomparable, Sacred Individual became definitely convinced that the sacred ways that exist for the purpose of self-perfection for all three-brained beings of the Universe were no longer suitable for the beings of the planet Earth, then, after his year of special observation and studies of their psyche, he again ascended that same Mount Vezniama, and for several terrestrial months contemplated and pondered how to carry out his decision, that is, to save the beings of this planet from their inherited predisposition to the crystallization of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, by means of those data which remained intact in their subconscious for the fundamental sacred being-impulse, Conscience. "This pondering of his definitely convinced him that it would indeed be possible to save them by means of the data in their common presence for engendering this sacred being-impulse, but only if the manifestations of these data surviving in the subconscious were without fail to participate in the functioning of the consciousness under whose direction their daily waking existence flows, and furthermore, only if this being-impulse were to be manifested over a long period through every aspect of this consciousness of theirs.



CHAPTER 27
The order of existence created for men by
the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash
BEELZEBUB went on to relate the following "My research and investigations
also made clear to me that after the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash had
pondered on Mount Vezniama and had drawn up in his mind a definite plan
for his further most saintly activities, he did not return to the city of Babylon
but went straight to the city of 'Djoolfapal,' the capital of a country then
called 'Kurlandtech' situated in the middle of the continent of Asia.
"On arriving there, he first of all entered into relations with the brethren of
the 'Tchaftantoori Brotherhood,' which had its place of existence not far from
that city, and whose name signified 'To be—or not to be at all.'
"This brotherhood was founded five of their years before the arrival of the
Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash on the initiative of two terrestrial three
brained beings who had become genuine 'initiates' according to the principles
existing before the 'Ashiatan' epoch.
"One of these two terrestrial beings who had become genuine initiates was
named Poundoliro and the other, Sensiminiriko.
"You should know, by the way, that in the common presences of both of
these genuine terrestrial initiates their highest being-parts had already been
coated to the gradation called 'completion,' and that, during their further
existence, they had time to perfect these highest parts of theirs to the required
gradation of sacred Objective Reason, thus today, their perfected highest
being-parts have become worthy to have, and in fact do have, the place of
their existence on the Holy Planet Purgatory.



"My further exhaustive investigations showed that in all the separate
spiritualized parts of the common presences of both of these three-brained
beings, Poundoliro and Sensiminiriko, there arose and was continuously
sensed the suspicion, which later became a conviction, that owing to some
obviously nonlawful causes, 'something very undesirable' for them had been
acquired and was functioning in their general organization and that, moreover,
it was impossible for this very 'undesirable something' to be removed simply
by means of the data present within them. They therefore decided to seek out
some other beings like themselves who were striving for the same aim, so that
they could try together to rid themselves of this very 'undesirable something.'
"They soon found beings corresponding to this aim among the 'monks'
dwelling in places called 'monasteries,' of which there were many at that
period in the environs of the city of Djoolfapal. And with these monks whom
they had chosen they founded the said brotherhood.
"So, after arriving in Djoolfapal, the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash
established relations with the brethren of the Tchaftantoori Brotherhood, who
were already working on that abnormal functioning of their psyche which they
themselves had observed; and he began to enlighten their Reason by means of
objectively true ideas, and to guide their being-impulses in such a way that
they could sense these truths without the least participation either of the
undesirable factors already abnormally crystallized in their presence, or of any
new factors that might arise from the results of external perceptions received
from the abnormally established forms of ordinary being-existence.
"While thus enlightening the brethren of this Tchaftantoori Brotherhood
and discussing his suppositions and intentions with them, the Very Saintly
Ashiata Shiemash was occupied with drawing up the 'rules' or, as is also said
there, the 'statutes' for the brotherhood which, in association with



the brethren he had already initiated, he founded in the city of Djoolfapal, and
which was later called the 'Heeshtvori Brotherhood,' a name signifying 'Only
he will be called and become the son of God who acquires in himself
Conscience. '
"Later, when everything had been worked out and organized with the
participation of these brethren of the former Tchaftantoori Brotherhood, the
Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash sent these same brethren to various places and
entrusted them, under his general guidance, with the task of spreading the
idea that in the 'subconscious' of all men there are crystallized and always
present the data manifested from Above for engendering in them the divine
impulse of genuine Conscience, and that only he who acquires the 'ableness'
to let the action of these data participate in the functioning of that
consciousness in which he passes his everyday existence has, in an objective
sense, the honest right to be called and really to be a genuine son of our
Common Father Creator of all that exists.
"These brethren preached this objective truth at first chiefly among the
monks of the many monasteries in the environs of Djoolfapal, and later
among the ordinary inhabitants of the city.
"As a result of their preaching they first of all selected thirty-five serious
and well-prepared what are called 'novices' for this Heeshtvori Brotherhood
that they had founded in the city of Djoolfapal.
"Thereafter, the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, while continuing to
enlighten the minds of the former brethren of the Tchaftantoori Brotherhood,
also undertook, with the help of these brethren, to enlighten the Reason of
those thirty-five 'novices.'
"And so it continued for the whole of one of their years, and only after this
did certain of the brethren of the former Tchaftantoori Brotherhood, as well as
certain of the thirty-five 'novices,' gradually prove worthy to become what are



called 'all-rights-possessing brethren' of this first Heeshtvori Brotherhood. "According to the statutes drawn up by the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash,
any one of them could become an 'all-rights-possessing brother' of the
Heeshtvori Brotherhood only when, in addition to the attainment of certain
other also foreseen objective merits, he could bring himself—in the sense of
the 'ableness consciously to direct the functioning of his own psyche'—to the
state of knowing how to convince to perfection a hundred other beings, and to
prove to them first that the factor for the impulse of Objective Conscience
exists in man, and second how this impulse must be manifested in order that
he may respond to the real sense and aim of his existence, moreover, so to
convince them that each of these others, in his turn, would acquire in himself
the necessary 'intensity of ableness' to convince no fewer than a hundred
others also.
"It was those who became worthy to be such 'all-rights-possessing
brethren' of the Heeshtvori Brotherhood who were first given the name of
'priest.'
"For your better comprehension of the very saintly activities of Ashiata
Shiemash, you must also know that afterward, when all the results of his
saintly labors were destroyed, this word 'priest,' as well as the word 'initiate'
about which I have already told you, was used and continues to be used by
your favorites down to the present time in two quite different senses.
"In one sense the word 'priest' was and still is commonly used—but only in
certain places—for unimportant separate groups of those professionals
existing there whom everybody now calls 'confessors' or 'clergymen.'
"And in the other sense, the word 'priest' was used and still is used to designate those beings who, by their pious existence and by the merits of their deeds performed for the



good of those around them, stand out so much from the rank and file of the
ordinary three-brained beings there that whenever they remember them there
arises in their presence the process called 'gratitude. '
"Already during that period, while the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash was
enlightening the Reason of the brethren of the former Tchaftantoori
Brotherhood and of the newly collected thirty-five 'novices,' there began to
spread among the ordinary beings of the city of Djoolfapal and its environs
the true idea that in the common presence of men-beings all the data exist for
the manifestation of the divine impulse of Conscience, but that this divine
impulse does not take part in their general consciousness, and that it takes no
part because certain of their manifestations, while bringing them various
'immediate satisfactions, destined to be paid for later,' and numerous material
advantages, nevertheless gradually atrophy the data put into their presence by
Nature for evoking in other beings around them, without distinction of 'brain
system,' the objective impulse of divine Love.
"This true information began to spread thanks chiefly to the ideally wise
foresight of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, which obliged, as I have
already told you, each one striving to become an 'all-rights-possessing
brother' of the Heeshtvori Brotherhood to attain, in addition to many definite
self-earned 'merits,' the 'ableness' to bring the three separate spiritualized and
associating parts of a further hundred three-brained beings there to sense the
divine impulse of Conscience.
"When the organization of the first Heeshtvori Brotherhood in the city of
Djoolfapal had been more or less regulated, and was established in such a
way that the further work could be carried on independently, simply under the
direction of the Reason of the brethren present in the brotherhood, the Very
Saintly Ashiata Shiemash himself then set



about choosing from among the 'all-rights-possessing brothers' those who had
begun, consciously by their Reason and unconsciously by their feelings, to
sense this divine impulse in their subconscious, and who were fully convinced
that by certain efforts upon themselves this divine being-impulse might
become and remain forever an inseparable part of their ordinary consciousness
And those who had sensed and become aware of this divine impulse of Con
science, and who were called 'first-degree initiates,' he set apart, and he began
to enlighten their Reason separately concerning 'objective truths' which up till
then had been quite unknown to the three-brained beings of that planet.
"And it was these 'first-degree initiates' whom he had set apart from the
others who were the first to be called 'great initiates.'
"You should note that at that time all the principles of Being of the initiated
beings there were renewed by the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash and later
came to be called 'Ashiata's renewals. '
"Well then, it was to those same 'great initiates' who were first set apart that
the Very Saintly, now Most Saintly, Ashiata Shiemash then explained in
detail, among other things, what this being-impulse of Objective Conscience
is, and how factors for its manifestation arise in the presence of three-brained
beings.
"And concerning this he once said the following " 'The factors for the being
impulse of Objective Conscience arise in three-brained beings from the
localization in their presence of particles of the "emanations of the sorrow" of
our All-Loving and Long-Suffering, Endless Creator, that is why the source of
manifestation of genuine Conscience in three-centered beings is sometimes
called the "Representative of the Creator. "
" 'And this sorrow is formed in our All-Maintaining



Common Father from the struggle constantly proceeding in the Universe between joy and sorrow. '
"And he said further: 'In all the three-centered beings of our entire Universe without
exception, including us men, owing to the data crystallized in our common
presence for engendering in us the divine impulse of Conscience, "all of us"
and the whole of our essence in its very foundation are and must be only
suffering.
'And we must be suffering, because this being-impulse can come to its
full manifestation in us only through the constant struggle between two quite
opposite 'complexes of functioning' issuing from two sources of quite opposite
origin, namely between the processes of the functioning of our planetary body
and the parallel processes of the functionings arising progressively from the
coating and perfecting of our higher being-bodies within this planetary body
of ours, which processes in their totality actualize every kind of Reason in
three-centered beings.
" 'Consequently, like all three-centered beings of our Great Universe, we
men existing on the Earth, owing to the presence in us also of the factors for
engendering the divine impulse of Objective Conscience, must always inev
itably struggle with the two quite opposite functionings arising and proceeding
in our common presence, the results of which are always sensed by us either
as "desires" or as "nondesires."
" 'And so, only he who consciously assists the process of this inner
struggle, and consciously assists the "nondesires" to prevail over the "desires,"
behaves in accordance with the Being of our Common Father Creator
Himself, whereas he who consciously assists the contrary only increases His
sorrow.



"So, my boy, owing to everything I have just told you, scarcely three years
passed before all the ordinary beings of the city of Djoolfapal and its environs,
and even of many countries of the continent of Asia, not only knew that this
divine being-impulse of genuine Conscience existed in them and that it could
take part in the functioning of their ordinary 'waking consciousness' and that,
in all the brotherhoods of the great prophet Ashiata Shiemash the initiates and
priests were elucidating and indicating what had to be done and how it had to
be done in order to attain this, but what is more, almost all of them began to
strive and to exert themselves in order to become priests of the Heeshtvori
Brotherhood, many branches of which were founded at that period on the
continent of Asia, each one functioning almost independently.
"And these almost independent brotherhoods arose in the following order:
"When the common work of the brotherhood founded in the city of
Djoolfapal had finally been established, the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash
began to send the aforementioned 'great initiates' with appropriate instructions
to organize similar brotherhoods in other countries and towns of the continent
of Asia, while he himself remained in Djoolfapal, and from there he guided
the activities of these helpers of his.
"However it may have been, my boy, it turned out that almost all your
favorites, those strange three-brained beings, wished and began to strive with
all their spiritualized being-parts to have divine Objective Conscience in their
ordinary waking consciousness That is to say, most of the beings of Asia of
that time began to work upon themselves under the guidance of initiates and
priests of the Heeshtvori Brotherhood, in order to transfer into their ordinary
consciousness the results of the data present in their subconscious for en



gendering the impulse of genuine divine Conscience and thereby, on the one hand, to have the possibility of completely removing from themselves, perhaps forever, the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, maleficent not only for them personally but also for subsequent generations to whom these properties would pass by heredity and, on the other hand, to have the possibility of consciously taking part in diminishing the sorrow of our Common Endless Father. "Owing to all this, at that period, particularly on the continent of Asia, the question of Conscience began to predominate during the ordinary process of being-existence of your favorites, both in the 'state of waking consciousness' and in the 'passive-instinctive state.' "Even those three-brained beings of that time in whose presence the taste of this divine impulse had not yet been transubstantiated, and who in their very strange consciousness, proper to them alone, had only the barest indications about this being-impulse which could be present in them as well, also tried to manifest themselves in everything according to these indications.
"The upshot of it all was that within ten terrestrial years there had disappeared of their own accord the two chief forms of abnormally established ordinary being-existence there, from which flowed and continue to flow most of the maleficent causes that increasingly prevent the establishment of conditions for at least a normal outer being-existence for your unfortunate favorites. "In the first place, their division into numerous communities, with various
forms of organization for external and even internal existence which they call
'state organizations,' disappeared of itself and, in the second place, there also
disappeared in the same way those various what are



called 'castes' or 'classes' that had long before been established in these numerous communities of theirs. "In my opinion, it was the second of these two chief forms of abnormally
established ordinary being-existence, namely, the assigning of each other to
different classes or castes, that had become, as you will surely understand for
yourself later, the basis for the gradual crystallization in the common pres
ence of your favorites of a particular psychic property that in the whole of the
Universe is inherent exclusively in the presence of those three-brained beings.
"This unique property was formed in them soon after the second
transapalnian perturbation and, gradually developing and becoming stronger
in them, passed from generation to generation by heredity, until it reached
contemporary beings as a lawful and inseparable part of their general psyche,
and this particular property they call 'egoism.'
"Sometime later, at an appropriate place in my further tales about the
three-brained beings of the planet Earth, I will explain to you in detail how,
thanks to the abnormal conditions of external being-existence established
there, your favorites first began assigning each other to various castes and
how subsequently, thanks again to similar abnormalities, this maleficent form
of mutual relationship has persisted until today But meanwhile you should
know that the cause of the arising in their common presence of this unique
property of 'egoism' was that, owing as always to those abnormally
established conditions, soon after the second transapalnian perturbation their
general psyche became dual.
"This became fully evident to me during my last sojourn on the surface of this planet of yours, when I began to be deeply interested in the legomonism concerning the deliberations of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash entitled 'The Terror of the Situation ' In the course of my detailed research



and investigations relating to his subsequent very saintly activities and their
results, the question arose in me of how and why those factors, obtained from
the particles of the emanations of the sorrow of our Common Father Creator
for the actualizing in their presence of the divine being-impulse of Objective
Conscience, were crystallized just in their 'subconscious,' and so avoided that
final degeneration of all the data placed in them for engendering the being
impulses of Faith, Hope, and Love And this strange anomaly, by the way,
fully justifies one of the numerous wise sayings of our highly esteemed,
irreplaceable, and honorable Mullah Nasr Eddin, which states:
'Every real happiness for man can arise exclusively from some
unhappiness—also real—which he has already experienced.
"This duality of their general psyche is produced because, on the one hand,
various what are called 'individual initiatives' issue from that localization in
their presence which is always predominant during their waking existence and
is nothing but the result of accidentally perceived impressions coming from
their abnormal environment, which taken as a whole make up their so-called
'consciousness', and on the other hand, various other 'individual initiatives'
simultaneously issue from that normal localization existing in the presence of
every kind of being which they call the 'subconscious.'
"And because these 'individual initiatives' issue from two different
localizations, each of your favorites in his daily waking existence is, as it
were, divided into two independent personalities.
"Here it must be remarked that this duality was also the reason why their
presence gradually lost that impulse, indispensable to three-brained beings,
called 'sincerity.'
"Later, the practice even took root among them of inten



tionally suppressing this being-impulse called 'sincerity', and now, from the day of their arising or, as they say, from the day of their !birth,' these threebrained beings are accustomed by their producers—or, as they say, their 'parents'— to an entirely contrary impulse, namely 'deceit.' "To teach and influence their children how to be insincere with others and deceitful in everything has become so ingrained in the beings of the planet Earth of the present time that they even consider this their duty toward their children, and they describe this conduct by the famous word 'education.' "They 'educate' their children never to be able and never to dare to do as
the conscience present in them instinctively directs, but only to do what is
prescribed in the manuals of 'bon ton' usually compiled by various candidate
hasnamusses.
"And of course by the time these children grow up and become responsible beings, they already manifest themselves and act automatically just as they were taught during their formation, just as was suggested to them, and just as they were 'wound up'—in short, just as they were 'educated ' "Thanks to all this, the conscience that might be in the consciousness of the beings of that planet is, from their earliest infancy, gradually driven back within, so that by the time they are grown up this conscience is found only in what they call their 'subconscious. ' "And the functioning of the aforementioned data for engendering in their presence this divine impulse of Conscience gradually ceased long ago to participate in that consciousness under the direction of which their 'waking existence' flows. "That is why, my boy, the crystallization in their common presence of the divine manifestation issuing from Above, forming the data for the arising of this sacred being-impulse, takes place only in their 'subconscious,' which has ceased to participate in the process of their ordinary daily existence,



so that these data have escaped the degeneration undergone by all the other sacred being-impulses that they also ought to have in their presence, namely, the impulses of Faith, Hope, and Love. "Furthermore if, for some reason or other, the action of the divine data crystallized in their presence for this being-impulse begins to manifest itself in certain of them from their 'subconscious,' and strives to participate in the functioning of their abnormally formed 'ordinary consciousness,' then no sooner are they aware of this than they at once take all sorts of measures to avoid it, because in the conditions now prevailing there it has become impossible for anyone to exist with the functioning in his presence of this divine impulse of genuine Objective Conscience. "Ever since 'egoism' became firmly implanted in the presence of your favorites, this unique being-property became, in its turn, the main contributing factor for the gradual crystallization in their general psyche of the data for the arising of several other exceptionally peculiar being-impulses, now existing there under the names of 'cunning,' 'envy,' 'hate,' 'hypocrisy,' 'contempt,' 'haughtiness,' 'servility,' 'slyness,' 'ambition,' 'duplicity,' and so on and so forth. "These exceptionally peculiar properties of their psyche which I have just named, utterly unbecoming to three-brained beings, were already fully crystallized in the presence of most of your favorites, and had become the inevitable attributes of the psyche of every one of them long before the period of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, but when the new forms of existence, intentionally created by Ashiata Shiemash himself, began to be fixed and to flow automatically in the process of their being-existence, these strange psychic properties entirely disappeared from the presence of most of the threebrained beings there Later, however, when they themselves destroyed all the results of the very saintly labors of this Essence-Loving Ashiata Shiemash,



these same maleficent psychic properties gradually arose again in all of them
and, in the contemporary three-brained beings there, they are the foundation
of the whole of their essence.
"And so, my boy, when the data arose in the common presence of your
favorites for engendering this peculiar being-impulse of egoism, this 'unique
property'—evolving gradually and giving rise to factors for other, also
peculiar, but secondary being-impulses—took the place of a Unique All
Autocratic Ruler in their general organization; and then, not only every
manifestation of that divine being-impulse of Conscience but even the faintest
stirring of that impulse became a hindrance to the actions of this All
Autocratic Ruler And later, when your favorites felt obliged, consciously or
unconsciously, always and in everything, to prevent the sacred impulse from
taking part in the functioning of that consciousness under the control of which
it had become proper for them to pass their waking existence, the action of
those divine data was gradually, as it were, 'diverted' from the functioning of
their ordinary consciousness and participated only in the functioning of their
'subconscious.'
"And it was only after my detailed research and investigations had made
all this clear to me, that I understood why there arose and still exists that
division of themselves into various 'classes' or 'castes' which has such
maleficent consequences for them.
"Later detailed investigations also showed me very definitely and clearly
that in that consciousness which they call the 'subconscious,' even in the
beings of the present time the data for the acquisition in their presence of this
fundamental divine impulse of Conscience do indeed continue to be
crystallized and hence to be present during the whole of their existence.



"The fact that these data for the divine being-impulse are still crystallized and that their manifestations continue to participate in the process of their being-existence was further confirmed, apart from the aforesaid investigations, by the difficulty I frequently had on account of it during my observations of them from the planet Mars. "The point is that, although I could freely observe the existence proceeding on the surface of the other planets of that solar system through my teskooano on the planet Mars without any difficulty whatsoever, my observations of the process of existence of your favorites was at times a real misery, owing to the special coloration of the atmosphere of the planet Earth. "And this special coloration occurred, as I later ascertained, because from time to time there appear in the presence of this atmosphere large quantities of those crystallizations which are frequently radiated from the presence of these favorites of yours when they are moved by the particular inner impulse which they call 'remorse of conscience. ' "And this is because, when they happen to receive and experience some kind of moral shock, the associations proceeding in them from impressions previously perceived— associations that consist mainly, as I have already told you, of various kinds of rubbish—almost always become changed, calmed, and even for a time entirely cease. "In consequence, there automatically takes place in the common presence of these three-brained beings there a combination of functioning that frees the data present in their 'subconscious' for the manifestation of the divine impulse of Objective Conscience and temporarily allows it to participate in the functioning of their ordinary consciousness, with the result that this 'remorse of conscience' begins to proceed in them And the 'remorse of conscience' thus produced in your favorites gives rise to those particular crys



tallizations I have mentioned, which issue from them mixed with other radiations, and it is the totality of these radiations that gives the atmosphere of your planet that special coloration which hinders the being-function of sight from penetrating freely through it. "Here it is necessary to say that these favorites of yours, particularly the contemporary ones, have become experts in preventing this inner impulse of theirs called 'remorse of conscience' from lingering long in their common presence. "No sooner do they begin to sense a twinge or even the slightest 'prick' of the arising of the functioning in them of this being-impulse than they immediately 'squash' it, whereupon this impulse, not yet quite formed in them, promptly subsides. "For 'squashing' the first stirring of any remorse of conscience in themselves, they have even invented some very effective special means which now exist there under the names of 'alcoholism,' 'cocainism,' 'morphinism,' 'nicotinism,' 'onanism,' 'monkism,' 'Athenianism,' and others with names also ending in 'ism. '
"Sometime later, my boy, on a suitable occasion, I shall also tell you in detail, as I promised, about those results of the abnormally established conditions of ordinary existence there that become factors for the arising and perpetuating of this maleficent assignment of each other to various castes. "I will without fail explain this to you, because the information about this abnormality may serve as very good data for a better understanding of the strangeness of the psyche of these three-brained beings who please you. "Meanwhile listen attentively and try to assimilate the following when the particular psychic property of 'egoism' had been completely formed in the common presence of these favorites of yours and had given rise—as it still continues to do—to various secondary impulses of which I have



told you, and furthermore, when the impulse of sacred Conscience had
entirely ceased to take part in their waking consciousness, these three-brained
beings arising and existing on the planet Earth, both before and after the
period of the very saintly activities of Ashiata Shiemash, have always striven
to organize their welfare during the process of their ordinary existence
exclusively for them themselves.
"And as in general there never is, nor can there be on any of the planets of
our Great Universe enough of everything required for the equal external
welfare of everyone, irrespective of what are called 'objective merits,' the
result is that the prosperity of some is always built on the adversity of others.
"It is this exclusive regard for their own personal welfare that has
gradually crystallized in their psyche the quite peculiar and unprecedented
properties I cited such as 'cunning,' 'contempt,' 'hate,' 'servility,' 'lying,'
'flattery,' and so on, which, on the one hand, are factors for outer
manifestations unbecoming to three-brained beings, and on the other are
causes of the gradual destruction of all those inner possibilities, placed in
them by Great Nature, of becoming particles of the whole of the Reasonable
Whole.
"Well then, my boy, when the results of the very saintly labors of the
Essence-Loving Ashiata Shiemash had begun to blend with the processes of
both their inner and outer being-existence, and when thanks to this the data
for the divine impulse of Conscience, surviving in their 'subconscious,'
shared more and more in the functioning of their 'waking consciousness,'
then their being-existence, both personal and in their relations with others,
began to proceed on this planet almost as it does on the other planets of our
Great Universe on which three-brained beings exist.
"These favorites of yours then began to behave toward one another as toward the manifestations, differing only in



degree, of a Unique Common Creator, and showed respect for one another
only according to the merits personally attained by means of 'being
partkdolgduty,' that is, by means of personal conscious labor and intentional
suffering.
"That is why, during that period there ceased to exist those two chief
maleficent forms of their ordinary existence, namely, their division into
separate independent communities and the division of themselves within these
communities into different 'castes' or 'classes.'
"At that time also, all the three-brained beings on your planet began to
consider themselves and to consider those like them simply as beings bearing
in themselves particles of the emanations of the sorrow of our Common
Father Creator.
"And all this came about because, when the action of the data for the
divine being-impulse was participating in the functioning of their 'ordinary
waking consciousness,' and the three-brained beings began behaving toward
one another solely in accordance with Conscience, the consequence was that
masters ceased to deprive their slaves of freedom, and power-possessing
beings of their own accord relinquished their unmerited rights, having
realized and felt by conscience that they exercised these rights and occupied
these positions not for the common welfare but only for the satisfaction of
their various personal weaknesses, such as 'vanity,' 'self-love,' 'self-calming,'
and so on.
"Of course, at that period there also continued to be all kinds of 'chiefs,'
'directors,' and 'specialist-advisors,' but just as on all planets of the Universe
inhabited by three-brained beings of varying degrees of self-perfecting, they
occupied these positions chiefly from difference of age and from what is
called 'essence-power,' instead of through hereditary right or by election, as
was the case both before and after this blissful Ashiatan epoch and is the case
today.



"All these chiefs, directors, and advisors then became such of themselves,
in the lawful course of events, in accordance with the objective merits they
personally acquired, which could be sensed as real by all the beings around
them.
"And this took place as follows: "All the beings of that planet then began to work in order to have in their
consciousness this divine function of genuine Conscience, and for this
purpose, as everywhere in the Universe, they transubstantiated in themselves
what are called the 'being-obligolnian strivings' of which there are five,
namely.
"The first striving to have in one's ordinary being-existence everything
satisfying and really necessary for the planetary body.
"The second striving to have a constant and unflagging instinctive need to
perfect oneself in the sense of Being.
"The third the conscious striving to know ever more and more about the
laws of world-creation and world-maintenance.
"The fourth the striving, from the beginning of one's existence, to pay as
quickly as possible for one's arising and individuality, in order afterward to be
free to lighten as much as possible the sorrow of our Common Father.
"And the fifth the striving always to assist the most rapid perfecting of
other beings, both those similar to oneself and those of other forms, up to the
degree of the sacred 'Mart-fotai,' that is, up to the degree of self-individuality
"During this period, when every terrestrial three-centered being existed
and worked consciously upon himself in accordance with these five strivings,
many of them, thanks to this, soon reached objective attainments perceptible
to others.
"The objective attainments of these beings of course attracted the attention of all those around them, who there



upon made those who had attained these merits stand out from their midst and paid them every kind of respect, Joyfully trying to merit the attention of these outstanding beings and to receive their indications and counsel as to how they likewise could perfect themselves. "These outstanding beings, in their turn, then began to make the one with the highest attainments among themselves stand out, and this outstanding being, without hereditary or other right, automatically became the chief of them all And corresponding to his recognition as chief, his directions were widely circulated not only on neighboring parts of the surface of your planet but also on other continents and islands. "At that period the counsel and guidance and, in general, every word of these chiefs became sacred law for all the three-brained beings there, and were followed with devotion and joy—contrary to what had proceeded there before the results obtained by the very saintly labors of Ashiata Shiemash, and to what again took place after they themselves had destroyed the fruits of these labors. "That is to say, these strange favorites of yours now carry out the various commands and injunctions of their chiefs and, as they call them, 'kings,' only from fear of what are called 'bayonets' and 'lousy cells,' of which there are a great many at the disposal of these chiefs and kings. "The results of the very saintly labors of Ashiata Shiemash also had definite repercussions on that terrible manifestation peculiar to the psyche of your favorites, namely, their 'irresistible urge periodically to destroy each other's existence. "The process of reciprocal destruction established there, ensuing from that terrible particularity of their psyche, entirely ceased on the continent of Asia, and took place only occasionally on those large and small territories of that planet of yours that were far away from this continent and where, because of the great distance, the influence of the 'initiates.'



and 'priests' could not reach and be transubstantiated in the presence of the beings breeding on these parts of the surface of your planet. "But the most astonishing and significant result of the very saintly labors
of Ashiata Shiemash was that at that period not only did the duration of the
existence of these unfortunates become a little more normal—that is to say, it
began to increase, while what they call the 'death rate' fell —but at the same
time the number of results for the continuation of their species diminished,
that is, their 'birth rate,' as they say, also fell by at least a fifth.
"Thereby there was practically demonstrated one of the cosmic laws called
the 'law of the equilibration of vibrations,' that is, vibrations arising from the
evolution and involution of the cosmic substances required for the Most Great
Omnicosmic Trogoautoegocrat.
"This decline in both their 'death rate' and 'birth rate' came about because,
as their existence became approximately normal for three-centered beings,
they also began to radiate from themselves vibrations corresponding more
closely to the requirements of Great Nature, thanks to which, Nature had less
need of those vibrations that are obtained from the destruction of the
existence of beings.
"You will also fully understand this cosmic law of the equilibration of
vibrations when at the proper time I explain to you in detail, as I have so often
promised, all the fundamental cosmic laws.
"It was just in this way, my boy, and in this sequence, that there was
gradually created, thanks to the conscious labors of the Very Saintly Ashiata
Shiemash, a welfare unprecedented for your favorites, but to the infinite
sorrow of all more or less consciously thinking individuals of all gradations of
Reason, shortly after the departure from this planet of the Very Saintly
Ashiata Shiemash, these unfortunates themselves, as had become proper to
them with



regard to every good attainment of their ancestors, totally destroyed it all, and thus it was they destroyed and swept away from the face of their planet all that beneficence, so that even the rumor has failed to reach contemporary beings that once upon a time such bliss existed. "Certain inscriptions, however, which have survived from ancient times and have reached contemporary beings, contain some information that there once existed on their planet a special kind of 'state organization,' at the head of which were beings of the highest attainments. "And on the basis of this information, the contemporary beings have merely invented a name for this 'state organization', they call it a 'priest-state,' and let it go at that. "But what this 'priest-state' was, and why it existed is it not all the same to contemporary beings of the planet Earth what 'ancient savages' did!"



CHAPTER 28
The chief culprit in the destruction of all the Very
Saintly Labors of Ashiata Shiemash
"You REMEMBER, my boy, I have already told you that the 'learned beings'
then assembled in the city of Babylon from almost the whole surface of the
Earth were not primarily to blame for the arising of the factors that caused the
final destruction of the surviving beneficent results of the conscious labors of
the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash for later generations of your favorites, but
as had long before become proper to most of the terrestrial 'learned beings of
new formation,' they were merely, like 'contagious bacilli,' the unconscious
dissemmators of every kind of already existing evil among their own and
subsequent generations.
"The basis of all the great and small maleficent activities of those 'learned'
beings and of all their unconscious harmful manifestations leading to the
destruction of the last remnants of the results, so beneficent for the three
brained beings there, of the very saintly conscious labors of the Essence
Loving Ashiata Shiemash was, as my further detailed research on his saintly
activities showed me, the 'invention' of a learned being, well known in his
day, who was also a 'learned being of new formation,' named Lentrohamsanin.
"Thanks to the double 'center of gravity' of his inner existence, the 'highest
being-part' of the presence of this terrestrial three-brained being was coated
and perfected up to the required gradation of Objective Reason, and later this
highest being-part became, as I once told you, one of those 313 'highest being
bodies' who are called 'Eternal Hasnamuss Individuals' and who have the
place of their further



existence in the Universe on a small planet named 'Eternal Retribution.' "Strictly speaking, as regards this terrestrial three-brained being
Lentrohamsanin, I should now have to keep my promise and explain to you
fully the expression 'hasnamuss,' but I prefer to do so a little later at the
proper place in the flow of my tale.
"The maleficent 'invention' or, as contemporary terrestrial learned beings
of new formation would say, the 'composition' or even the 'creation' of that
learned being was actualized, as I have already told you, at least two
centuries before the time when during my fifth sojourn I first visited the city
of Babylon, where learned beings were assembled, partly by coercion and
partly voluntarily, from almost the whole surface of the planet.
"This maleficent 'invention' of that learned being of a former period
reached the learned beings of the Babylonian epoch by means of what is
called a 'kashireitleer,' inscribed by Lentrohamsanin with his own hand.
"I find it necessary to give you a few details about the arising of this
Lentrohamsanin and how, thanks to the accidental circumstances of his
environment, he later became a 'great learned being' and an authority for his
contemporaries almost everywhere on the surface of your planet.
"This very characteristic story can serve as an excellent example of a
practice, long ago firmly established in the process of existence of these
three-brained beings who have taken your fancy, by which some of them
become so to say 'authorities,' at first for other 'learned beings of new for
mation' and then for all the unfortunate ordinary beings there.
"It was by chance that I came upon the details concerning the conditions
of Lentrohamsanin's arising and subsequent formation into a responsible
being, while I was trying to



find out which aspects of the strange psyche of your favorites had led to the
gradual change, and finally to the total destruction, of all those beneficent
forms introduced and fixed in the process of their being-existence by the
ideally foreseeing Reason of our now Omnicosmic, Very Saintly Ashiata
Shiemash, during the period of his self-preparation to be what he now is for
the whole of the Universe.
"It was then that I learned that this Lentrohamsanin arose or, as is said
there, was 'born' on the continent of Asia in the city of 'Kronbookhon,' the
capital of 'Nievia.'
"His conception resulted from the blending of two heterogeneous
'exioëharies' formed in two already elderly three-brained 'keschapmartnian'
beings.
"His 'producers' or, as they say, his 'parents,' having chosen the capital of
Nievia as their place of permanent existence, had moved there three terrestrial
years before the arising of that future Universal Hasnamuss.
"He was the first-born of his elderly and very rich parents, for although the
blending of their exioëharies had been actualized many times before, yet, as I
found out, they were so absorbed in acquiring riches that they did not wish to
be hindered in this pursuit, and always had recourse, at each actualization of
this sacred blending, to what is called 'toosy' or, as your contemporary
favorites express it, 'abortion. '
"By the time the source of the 'active principle of his origin,' in other
words his father, had built up his fortune, he had several 'caravans' of his own
as well as 'caravanserais' for bartering goods in various cities of Nievia.
"As for the source of the 'passive principle of his origin,' that is, his
mother, she at first followed the profession of what is called 'toosidji,' but
later she organized a 'holy place' on a small mountain, and spread propaganda
about its supposed significance, which was that childless beings of the female
sex, on visiting this place, would become able to conceive



"When this couple, in what is called their 'declining years,' had become
very rich, they moved to the city of Kronbookhon to exist there solely for
their own pleasure.
"But soon they felt that without a real 'result,' that is, 'without a child,'
pleasure could never be complete, and from that time on, without sparing any
money, they took every possible measure to obtain such a 'result. '
"With this in view, they visited all sorts of holy places maintained for that
purpose, with the exception, of course, of their own 'holy mountain,' and tried
every kind of 'medical means' that purported to aid the blending of heteroge
neous exioëharies And when by chance this blending actually took place,
there finally arose that long-awaited result of theirs, later called
Lentrohamsanin.
"From the very first, his parents were completely wrapped up in what they
described as their 'God-sent result,' or son, and spent vast sums on his
pleasures and on what is called his 'education. '
"Their ideal was to give him the very best upbringing and education the
Earth could provide.
"For this purpose they engaged what are called 'tutors' and 'teachers,' both
from their own country of Nievia and from various distant lands.
"The foreign 'tutors' and 'teachers' were brought there chiefly from the country today called 'Egypt. ' "By the time this 'papa's and mama's darling' was nearing the age of
responsible being he was already, as they say there, 'very well brought up'
and 'educated', that is, he had in his presence a great many data for all kinds
of 'egoplastikoori' consisting, as usual, of fantastic and dubious information,
and later, when he reached responsible age in the abnormally established
conditions of existence there, he responded automatically to all kinds of
corresponding accidental shocks.
"When this future great learned being reached responsible age he had indeed a great deal of information or, as it is



called there, 'knowledge', nevertheless in relation to this information or 'knowledge' he had acquired no Being whatever.
"Well, on the one hand because of the total lack of Being in his presence and on the other hand because there were already thoroughly crystallized in him those consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer called 'vanity,' 'self-love,' 'swaggering,' and so forth, this 'mama's and papa's darling,' having become a learned being of new formation, had the ambition to be considered a 'famous scientist'—not only among the beings of Nievia but also over the whole of the surface of their planet. "So, with all his presence he dreamed and ruminated about how he could
attain this.
"He spent many days in serious thought, and finally decided first of all to invent a theory about some question nobody before him had ever touched upon, and then to inscribe this invention of his upon a 'kashireitleer,' the likes of which had never been inscribed upon before, nor ever could be in the future. "And from that day on he set to work to carry out that decision of his. "With the help of his many slaves he first prepared such a 'kashireitleer' as had never existed before. "In those days on the planet Earth, 'kashireitleers' were usually made from
one or another part of the hide of a quadruped being called 'buffalo,' but
Lentrohamsanin made his 'kashireitleer' from a hundred buffalo hides joined
together.
"By the way, 'kashireitleers' were later replaced by what is called
'parchment.'
"Well, when this unprecedented kashireitleer was ready, the future great Lentrohamsanin inscribed upon it his invention concerning a question that indeed had never entered



anybody's head before, nor was there any reason why it should have.
"That is to say, in these wiseacrings of his he criticized in every way the
prevailing order of collective existence.
"This kashireitleer began thus: " 'Man's greatest happiness consists in not being dependent on any other
person, whoever it may be, and in being free from the influence of anyone
whatsoever!'
"Some other time, my boy, I will explain to you how your favorites on the
planet Earth generally understand 'freedom.'
"The inscription of this future Universal Hasnamuss went on as follows:
" 'Undeniably, life under the present state organization is far better for us
than it used to be, but where then is that real freedom which we need to bring
us happiness?
" 'Don't we work and toil as much now as we did under any former state
organization?
" 'Do we not have to labor and sweat to get enough barley to keep us alive and
not starve to death-like chained dogs?
'Our lords and masters and pastors are always harping upon some other
world, supposedly so much better than this one, where life is wholly blissful
for the souls of those men who have lived worthily here on Earth 'Don't we
live here worthily now? 'Don't we constantly labor and sweat for our daily
bread?
'If all that our masters and pastors tell us is true and if their own way of
living here on Earth really corresponds to what is required of their souls for
the other world, surely God ought to, and even must, give them more
possibilities in this world than to us ordinary mortals.
" 'If everything that our leaders and counselors tell us and try to make us
believe is really true, let them prove it to us ordinary mortals by facts.



" 'Let them prove it to us, for instance, by changing a pinch of common
sand into bread—the very sand in which, thanks to the sweat of our brow, the
barley grows for our daily bread.
'Let our present leaders and counselors do this, and I will be the first to fall on my knees and kiss their feet. " 'But meanwhile, things being as they are, we ourselves must struggle and
we ourselves must strive for our real happiness and real freedom, and liberate
ourselves from the need to toil and sweat.
" 'True, for eight months of the year we have no trouble obtaining our
daily bread, but how we must work ourselves to the bone during those four
summer months getting the barley we need.'
" 'Only he who sows and reaps the barley knows what hard labor it takes.
" 'True, for eight months we are free, but only from physical labors, while
our consciousness, namely, our dearest and highest part, is the slave, day and
night, of these illusory ideas always being dinned into us by our masters and
pastors.
'No, enough.' We ourselves, without our present leaders and counselors, who have become such without our consent, must strive for our real freedom and our real happiness. 'And we can obtain real freedom and happiness only if we all act as one,
that is, "all for one and one for all " But first we must destroy everything that
is old.
" 'And we must do this to make room for the new life we ourselves shall
create, which will give us real freedom and real happiness.
" 'Down with dependence on others! " 'We ourselves will be the masters of our own destiny and no longer those
who rule our lives without our knowledge and without our consent.
" 'Our lives must be governed and guided by those whom



we ourselves shall elect from our midst, that is, only from those who themselves toil for their daily bread. " 'And we must elect these governors and leaders on the basis of equal rights without distinction of sex or age, by universal, direct, equal, and open ballot.
"Thus ended that famous kashireitleer.
"When this future Universal Hasnamuss, Lentrohamsanin, had finished
inscribing his wiseacrings on this unprecedented kashireitleer, he arranged an
enormous and costly banquet to which he invited the 'learned beings' from all
over Nievia, taking upon himself all their traveling expenses, and at the end
of the feast he showed them his kashireitleer.
"The 'learned beings' gathered at that free banquet from almost the whole
of Nievia were at first so flabbergasted at the sight of that unique kashireitleer
that they were, as is said there, !struck dumb,' and it was only after some time
that they began to look at each other with amazement and to exchange
opinions in whispers.
"Above all they asked one another how it was possible that not a single
being, ordinary or learned, had known or guessed that in their own country
there existed a learned being with such knowledge.
"Suddenly the oldest one of them, and the most renowned, jumped up on
the table like a boy, and with the intonation long since proper to the learned
beings of new formation, which has also reached contemporary learned
beings, proclaimed the following:
'Listen, all of you, and try to realize that we, assembled here as
representatives of the beings of the Earth—we who have already, thanks to
our great knowledge, attained independent individuality—now have the
privilege of being the first to behold with our own eyes the coming of a Mes
siah of divine consciousness, sent from Above to reveal world truths to us '



"Thereupon began that pernicious reciprocal 'praising to the skies' which
has always been practiced among the 'learned beings of new formation' and
which prevents any true knowledge that happens to reach them from evolving
there as it does everywhere else in the Universe, if only through the passage
of time, on the contrary, owing to this maleficent practice, even the
knowledge already attained is destroyed, and its possessors become shallower
and shallower.
"Well then, all the learned beings began shouting and pushing each other
in order to get near Lentrohamsanin, and hailing him as their 'long-awaited
Messiah,' they expressed to him by their admiring glances the extent of what
is called their 'high titillation. '
"The most interesting thing about all this is the reason why these learned
beings were so worked up and gave vent so freely to their learned 'snivelings,'
which was that there had been formed in the psyche of your favorites, thanks
as always to the same abnormally established conditions of ordinary
existence, a certain extremely strange conviction that anyone who becomes a
follower of a well-known and important being will appear to others to be
almost as well known and important himself.
"So, on the strength of his being very rich, and what is more now very
famous, all the other learned beings of the country of Nievia immediately
expressed their approval of this Lentrohamsanin.
"Well, my dear boy, no sooner had the learned scientists of Nievia returned
home after this banquet than they began talking, at first to their neighbors and
later here, there, and everywhere, about that extraordinary kashireitleer, and,
foaming at the mouth, they asserted and proved to everybody the truth of
those 'revelations' which the great Lentrohamsanin had inscribed upon this
kashireitleer.



"The result of it all was that the ordinary beings of the city of
Kronbookhon, as well as of other cities of Nievia, talked among themselves
of nothing but these 'revelations.'
"And gradually, as usually happens there almost everywhere, beings
became divided into two opposing parties, one of which favored the
'invention' of the future Universal Hasnamuss, and the other the already well
established forms of being-existence.
"Thus it continued for almost a whole terrestrial year, during which the
ranks of the contending parties increased everywhere, while toward each
other one of their specific properties called 'hate' also increased The result
was that one sorrowful day in the city of Kronbookhon there suddenly broke
out between the followers of these two opposing currents the process of what
is called 'civil war.'
'Civil war' is the same as 'war', the only difference is that in ordinary
war beings of one community destroy the beings of another community,
whereas in civil war the process of reciprocal destruction goes on among
beings of one and the same community—for example, brother annihilates
brother, father, son, uncle, nephew, and so on.
"During the first four days, while that horrible process was at its height in
Kronbookhon, and the attention of the other beings of the whole country of
Nievia was concentrated on it, everything was still relatively quiet in the
other cities, except for occasional skirmishes here and there But at the end of
the fourth day, those who were for the 'invention' of Lentrohamsanin, that is,
for the 'learned beings,' were victorious in Kronbookhon, and from then on
the same process began in all the large and small cities of Nievia.
"This widespread and horrible process continued until a 'horde' of learned
beings appeared who, 'feeling firm ground beneath their feet,' compelled all
the surviving beings to accept Lentrohamsanin's ideas, and immediately
destroyed everything From then on, all the three-brained beings of



Nievia became followers of the 'invention' of Lentrohamsanin, and soon
afterward there was established in that community a special form of
government called a 'republic.'
"Still later, the community of Nievia, having by then become great and
powerful, began, as usually happens there, making war on neighboring
communities for the purpose of imposing upon them its new form of 'state
organization. '
"And so, my boy, on the largest continent of your planet, the processes of
reciprocal destruction again began to take place among these strange three
brained beings, and at the same time there were gradually changed and finally
destroyed those various beneficent forms of ordinary existence which had
been established thanks to the ideally foreseeing Reason of our now Most
Saintly Ashiata Shiemash.
"Thereupon there again arose on the surface of your planet—only to be
destroyed anew and to give place to others—numerous separate communities
with every kind of 'inner state organization. '
"Although the direct effect of that maleficent invention of the now
Universal Hasnamuss Lentrohamsanin was that the practice of existing in
separate communities was revived among your favorites, and although they
again resumed their periodic reciprocal destruction, yet in some of these
newly arisen, independent communities on the continent of Asia beings still
continued to conform in their ordinary existence to many of the wisely
foreseen usages of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, which had been
inseparably fused with the automatic process of their daily life.
"And so those who were to blame for the final destruction of the usages
and customs that still remained in certain communities were the
aforementioned 'learned beings' who had been assembled in the city of
Babylon.
"And they were to blame owing to the following circumstances:



"At the !general planetary conference' of all the learned beings on the famous 'question of the beyond,' which was organized in Babylon, it happened that among those who went there of their own accord was the great-grandson of Lentrohamsanin, who had himself become a 'learned being. ' "He brought with him an exact copy on papyrus of his great-grandfather's famous kashireitleer, the original of which he had received by inheritance And at the very height of the 'frenzy' unleashed by the 'question of the soul,' during one of the last big general meetings of the learned beings, he read aloud the text of that maleficent 'invention' of his great-grandfather, whereupon it occurred, as had become proper to the strange Reason of these 'sorry scientists,' that from one question that interested them they at once passed to quite another, namely, from the question of the 'soul' to the question of what is called 'politics.' "Then, all over the city of Babylon meetings and discussions again began on the subject of various kinds of 'state organizations,' those already existing and those which in their opinion ought to be formed. "Of course, all their discussions were based on the 'truths' expounded in the invention of Lentrohamsanin, as reproduced on the papyrus brought by his great-grandson, a copy of which almost every learned being then in Babylon carried in his pocket. "For several months they discussed and argued, and they ended up by splitting into 'parties', that is to say, all the learned beings then in the city of Babylon split into three independent sections, under the following names "The first the section of the 'Legomonists', "The second the section of the 'Neomothists', "The third the section of the 'Paleomothists ' "Each of these sections soon had its adherents among the ordinary beings of Babylon, and once again things would



certainly have ended in civil war if the Persian king, getting wind of all this,
had not immediately cracked them on their learned noddles.
"On his orders some of these learned scientists were executed, others were
imprisoned with lice, and still others were banished to places where even
now, as Mullah Nasr Eddin would say, 'French champagne cannot be found '
The few who were shown to have been mixed up in all this only because they
were obviously mad were permitted to return to their own countries, while
those who had taken no part whatever in 'political questions' were not only
given full liberty to return to their native lands, but by order of the Persian
king, their departure was even conducted with 'full honors.'
"And so, my boy, those Babylonian learned beings who for various reasons
survived and were scattered over almost the whole surface of the planet
continued by momentum to wiseacre, taking as their basis—not consciously,
of course, but simply mechanically—the two leading questions that had
arisen during those Babylonian events and had become the 'theme of the day,'
namely, the famous questions concerning the 'soul of man' and 'internal state
organization.'
"The result of these wiseacrings of theirs was that throughout the continent
of Asia civil wars broke out in various communities and the process of mass
reciprocal destruction between different communities started up once more.
"The destruction of the last remnants of the conscious labors of the Very
Saintly Ashiata Shiemash thus continued on the continent of Asia for about a
century and a half, yet in spite of this, certain customs created by Ashiata
Shiemash for the good of their being-existence were still preserved in some
places and continued by momentum.



"But when the three-brained beings of the neighboring continent, now
called 'Europe,' began taking part in these Asiatic wars and when 'hordes,' led
by the arch-vainglorious Greek called Alexander of Macedonia, overran
almost the whole continent of Asia, they made, as is said, a 'clean sweep' from
the surface of that ill-fated planet of everything that had been established and
preserved, so clean a sweep that not a trace was left even of the memory that
there once existed on their planet such 'bliss,' intentionally created for their
existence by that Reason whose possessor is now one of our seven Most
Saintly Omnicosmic Individuals, without whose participation even our Uni
Being Common Father does not allow Himself to actualize anything.
"And now, my boy, after my tale about this Lentrohamsanin—thanks to
which you have received a concrete picture of the consequences for later
generations of the activities of a typical representative of Eternal Hasnamuss
Individuals— it will be opportune to explain a little more in detail, as I
promised you, the significance of the word 'hasnamuss.'
"In its widest sense the word 'hasnamuss' designates any three-brained
being—whether he has already coated his highest being-parts or consists of
his planetary body alone —in whose common presence, under the influence
of certain 'individual impulses,' a certain 'something' arises which participates
in the 'completed formation' of his independent individuality.
"This 'something' arises in these cosmic individuals and, during the process
of the transformation of substances, blends with the crystallizations resulting
from the action of the entire 'spectrum' of what are called 'naloo-ossnian
impulses. '
"In accordance with the chief cosmic law, the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, this 'naloo-ossnian spectrum of impulses'



in its original essence consists of seven heterogeneous layers, from the point of view of their engendering as perception and resulting manifestation. "And if these different aspects of the entire 'spectrum of naloo-ossnian impulses' were described according to the notions of your favorites and expressed in their language, they might be defined as follows:
1 Every kind of depravity, conscious as well as unconscious, 2 The feeling of self-satisfaction from leading others astray,
3 The irresistible urge to destroy the existence of other breathing creatures, 4 The inclination to free oneself from the necessity of making the beingefforts required by Nature, 5 The tendency to make use of every kind of artifice to conceal what in the opinion of others are one's physical defects, 6 Serene enjoyment in the use of what is not personally deserved,
7 The striving to be not what one is
"This 'something' which, together with these 'naloo-ossnian' impulses, arises in the presences of specific individuals not only is the cause of 'painfully retributive consequences' for these individuals themselves but also has the particularity that, whenever one of these 'imperious tendencies' ceases to act in their presences, the radiation proper to one or another aspect of the manifestation of this 'something' has a greater effect on surrounding beings, and becomes a factor for engendering the same in them. "In the common presence of every three-brained being, there can arise during the process of his planetary existence any one of four kinds of independent hasnamuss individual.



"The first kind of hasnamuss individual is a three-brained being who,
while acquiring this 'something' in his common presence, still consists only of
his planetary body and who, during the process of the sacred rascooarno is
subject to the consequences of the properties of this 'something' in him and is
thus destroyed forever such as he is.
"The second kind of hasnamuss individual is a three-brained being in
whose common presence the 'kesdjan body' has already been coated with the
participation of that same 'something', and, as is proper to such a cosmic
arising, having acquired the property of 'toorinoorino,' that is,
'nondecomposition' in any sphere of that planet on which he arose, has to
exist such as he is, undergoing certain transformations, until this 'something'
has been eliminated from him.
"A hasnamuss individual of the third kind is a three-brained being in
whose common presence the highest being-body, or 'soul,' has been coated,
again with the participation of this 'something', and this highest being-body
also acquires the property of toorinoorino, but this time corresponding to this
highest coating, that is to say, it is not subject to decomposition, either in the
spheres of that planet on which he arose, or in any other sphere of the Great
Universe.
"The fourth kind of hasnamuss individual is like the third, but with this
difference, that the hasnamuss of the third kind has the possibility of at some
time becoming so to say 'cleansed' from this 'something,' whereas for the
fourth kind this possibility is lost forever
"That is why the fourth kind of hasnamuss is called an 'Eternal Hasnamuss
Individual.'
"For these four kinds of hasnamuss individuals who have this 'something' in
their presence, the 'retributive consequences' I have mentioned do not entail
the same suffering, but correspond to the nature of each as well as to the 'ob



jective responsibilities' flowing from the original foresight and hope of our
Common Father for these cosmic actualizations.
"For the hasnamuss of the first kind, who acquires this 'something' while
consisting only of a planetary body, the decomposition of his planetary body
does not proceed according to the general rule, that is to say, all the various
sensed impulses in his organism do not stop functioning simultaneously at
the approach of the sacred rascooarno, that is, death.
"But the process of the sacred rascooarno already begins in him during his
planetary existence and proceeds in stages, that is, one by one his 'separate
spiritualized localizations' gradually cease to function in his common
presence—or, as your favorites would say, in such a being first one of his
brains with all its functions dies, later on, the second one dies, and only then
does the final death of the being occur.
"In addition to this, after the final death, the disintegration of all the active
elements of which the 'planetary body' was formed proceeds much more
slowly than usual, and is subject to the inextinguishable action—lessening
only in proportion to the volatilization of the active elements—of the 'naloo
ossnian impulses' sensed during his life.
"For the second kind of hasnamuss individual, in whose common presence
the 'kesdjan body' has already been coated, the 'retributive consequences' are
that, on the one hand, such an indeed unfortunate arising, freed from the
planetary body of a three-brained being, and not having the possibility of
perfecting himself independently without a planetary coating, does not
succeed in eliminating from his presence this maleficent 'something,' which
is not necessarily acquired by his own fault, and which always and in
everything in the Universe is an obstacle to the correct flowing of the
'common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process', and on the other hand, owing
to the property of 'toorinoorino,'



that is, not being subject to decomposition in any sphere of that solar system in which he arose, he must inevitably be coated in a new planetary body, usually with the exterior form of a being of a one- or two-brained system, and in view of the generally brief existence of such beings and of his not having time to adapt himself to any one exterior form, he must constantly begin all over again in the form of another being of that planet with all the uncertainty as to the result of this coating. "And as for a hasnamuss individual of the third kind, namely, a threebrained being in whom the highest being-body has been coated, but with this 'something' participating to the extent that he has not lost forever the possibility of freeing himself from it, his fate is still more terrible For, as a higher cosmic arising predetermined by the foresight of the First Principle of everything existing to serve as a help in the administration of the enlarging world—who from the moment of his completed formation, even before being perfected in Reason, was held responsible for every subjective manifestation, voluntary or involuntary—he has the possibility of eliminating this 'something' from his presence, but solely through the action of the results of intentionally actualized partkdolgduty, that is to say, of conscious labor and intentional suffering. "Such a higher being-body must therefore suffer unremittingly, according
to the degree of 'cognizance of his own individuality,' until this 'something' is
entirely eradicated from his common presence.
"As a place for the suffering existence of the high orders of hasnamuss individuals, the Higher Sacred Individuals have intentionally allotted from all the large cosmic concentrations four small planets, disharmonized in their subjective functioning and situated in various most remote corners of our Great Universe.



"One of these four disharmonized planets, called 'Retribution,' is specially
prepared for the Eternal Hasnamuss Individuals, and the other three for the
higher being-bodies of hasnamusses who still have in their presence the
possibility of ridding themselves at some time or other of this maleficent
'something. '
"These three small planets exist under the names of:
Remorse of Conscience Repentance Self-Reproach
"Here it is interesting to note that from all the highest being-bodies that have
been coated and perfected in every kind of exterior form of three-brained
being of the whole Universe, only 313 have, so far, reached the planet
Retribution, two of whom had their arising on your planet, and one of these is
the highest being-body of precisely this Lentrohamsanin.
"On that planet Retribution, the Eternal Hasnamuss Individuals must
constantly endure those incredible torments called 'inkiranondel,' which are
like the suffering of 'remorse of conscience' only much more intense.
"The greatest anguish of this state of the highest being-bodies is that they
must always endure these terrible sufferings, fully conscious that there is no
hope whatever of their coming to an end. "



SECOND BOOK



CHAPTER 29
The fruits of former civilizations and the
blossoms of the contemporary
"IN FOLLOWING the associative flow of my tales about the three-brained beings breeding on the planet Earth who have taken your fancy, I must now tell you, my boy, something about
the two powerful communities there called 'Greeks' and 'Romans,' who swept
away from the surface of that ill-fated planet even the memory of the results
obtained from the most saintly labors of the Essence-Loving Ashiata
Shiemash.
"First of all I must tell you that at the time when, on the surface of your
planet, on the continent of Asia, the definitized sacred conception of our now
Omnicosmic, Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash was actualized from Above
within the presence of a three-brained being, and also later, during the period
of his very saintly activities and the subsequent gradual destruction by your
favorites of all the results issuing from them, great numbers of those strange
three-brained beings existed on the neighboring continent called 'Europe,' and
had already grouped themselves into various independent communities.
"According to the cosmic laws I once mentioned to you, the two
communities that during those periods became the greatest and most
powerful, that is to say, better organized and possessing more means than the
others for the process of reciprocal destruction, were the 'Greek' and 'Roman'
communities.
"And about these 'very ancient' communities—'ancient,' that is, from the
point of view of your contemporary favorites—I must tell you and possibly
even in detail, for not only did they make a 'clean sweep' from the face of that



unfortunate planet of the last results that might have been beneficial for the
three-brained beings of all subsequent epochs, and even of all trace of the
memory of the very saintly labors of the Essence-Loving Ashiata Shiemash,
but also they were the cause of the utter nonsense that proceeds in the Reason
of your contemporary favorites, and of the complete atrophy in them of that
'fundamental being-impulse,' the main lever of objective morality, called
'organic shame.'
"A closer acquaintance with these large groupings of your favorites and
with the various 'blessings' bequeathed by them to the beings of later epochs
will help you to understand how separate independent communities are
formed there, and how a given community, having become powerful—with no
thanks to the beings themselves—takes advantage of this to begin destroying
everything attained by other less powerful communities and forces its own
'new inventions' upon them, in most cases sincerely imagining that these are
just what the others need.
"I must warn you, my boy, that my story of the arising of those ancient
communities called the 'Greek' and the 'Roman,' and of everything later
connected with them, is not based on my personal investigations, but only on
the information about them that I got from one of the beings of our tribe who
chose to remain forever on that planet of yours.
"In descending to the planet Earth for the sixth and last time, I was
determined, at any cost, to elucidate for myself all the genuine reasons why
the psyche of the three-brained beings on that planet, which should be like the
psyche of all the three-brained beings of our Great Universe, had become so
exceptionally strange.
"And having repeatedly confirmed, during my investigations, that the
fundamental cause of the various abnormalities in the general psyche of
contemporary beings was



the so-called 'civilization' spread by these two large groups of beings called the Greeks and the Romans, I was obliged to investigate certain details about them also. "But as I was fully occupied at that time with my research concerning the activities of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, I entrusted the inquiry into the history of the arising of these two independent groupings of your favorites, with respect to what is called their 'subjective being,' to that same member of our tribe who, as I have already told you, still carries on an 'undertaker's business' in a large city on the continent of Europe. "From the investigations of this countryman of ours, it seems that long, long ago, before the period of my tale about the majestic city of Babylon, that is, when the existence of those strange beings was proceeding mainly on the continent of Asia and their chief center of culture was in the country of Tikliamish, there were as yet no definitely organized communities on the continent of Europe, which is now the principal place of existence of your favorites. "At that time, there chiefly existed on that continent two-brained and onebrained beings called 'wild quadrupeds' and 'reptiles', as for your favorites, the biped beings, they existed there only in small groups and were almost as wild as the quadrupeds themselves. "These small groups of biped beings occupied themselves only with destroying the quadruped and reptile beings, and occasionally also one another. And the number of your favorites on the continent of Europe did not increase until emigrants from Maralpleicie, wandering from one region to another, finally arrived on the continent of Europe and settled there.
"Toward the close of that period there migrated from Tikliamish to that continent a number of beings of the first



Asiatic group who followed two quite different professions, some of them
were engaged in various marine occupations, and others in raising cattle and
sheep.
"The sheep-raising families settled chiefly on the southern shores of the
continent, which at that time were very suitable for the grazing and fattening
of these quadruped beings.
"And that group of terrestrial beings was then called 'Latinaki,' a word that
meant 'shepherds.'
"At first these shepherds, with their families and flocks, were scattered in
different places Later on their numbers gradually increased, partly through the
immigration of Asiatic beings with the same profession as themselves and
partly because they were becoming more and more 'prolific,' since Nature on
the planet Earth had begun to adapt herself to the deteriorating quality of the
vibrations she required, which should have been formed from the radiations of
these three-brained beings, by substituting those vibrations obtained only from
the process of their sacred 'rascooarno' or, as they say, from their 'death.'
"And when thanks to all this their numbers had considerably increased, and
external conditions demanded frequent relations between isolated families,
they formed their first place of common existence, which was called 'Rimk.'
"It was from that group of Asiatic shepherds that the later famous 'Romans'
originated, their name having come from this first common dwelling place,
Rimk.
"As for the Asiatic beings engaged in 'marine occupations,' such as fishing
and gathering sponges, coral, and seaweed, they also emigrated with their
families for the convenience of their profession, some of them settling on the
western shores of their own continent of Ashhark, some on the southeastern
shores of the continent of Europe, and others on the islands near the straits
that still divide these two continents.



"The beings of these newly formed groups were then called 'Hellenaki,' which meant 'fishermen.' "In time their numbers also grew, owing to the same causes I spoke of with regard to the group of shepherds. "Their name changed many times until finally they were known as 'Greeks.'
"And so, my dear boy . . . it was largely on account of the beings of these two
groups that the Reason of your contemporary favorites has become
mechanical, and that the data for engendering the impulse of 'being-shame'
have completely atrophied in them.
"The Greeks were the cause of the gradual decay of the Reason of the
three-brained beings there, which has so degenerated in contemporary beings
that it has become, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin says, a real 'mill for
nonsense.
"And it is thanks to the Romans that, as a result of successive changes in
the presence of contemporary three-brained beings, those factors are never
crystallized which in other three-brained beings engender the impulse called
'instinctive shame,' that is, the being-impulse that is the basis of what are
called 'morals' and 'objective morality.'
"And thus it was that those two communities arose which, as so often happens there, later became solidly established and powerful for a certain time. "And the history of the maleficent 'legacy' they passed on to the beings of
subsequent generations is as follows:
"According to the investigations of our countryman, it seems that the
earliest ancestors of the beings of the community that was later called
'Greece' were obliged, during the frequent storms at sea that hindered them in
their 'marine occupations,' to seek refuge from the rams and winds in
sheltered places, where they played various 'games' they had invented, to 'kill
time.'
"As it later became clear, these ancient fishermen at first



amused themselves with such games as children play there —but children, it
must be remarked, who have not yet gone to school, for today those who go to
school have so much homework to do, consisting chiefly of learning by rote
the poetry composed by various candidate hasnamusses that the poor children
never have time to play any games at all.
"In short, these poor bored fishermen first played ordinary children's
games long since customary there, but later, when one of them invented a new
game called 'pouring from the empty into the void,' they were all so pleased
with it that from then on they amused themselves with that alone.
"This game consisted in formulating some question or other, always about
some nonsense, that is to say, a question about some deliberate piece of
absurdity, and the one to whom the question was addressed had to answer as
plausibly as possible.
"Well, it was just this game that became the cause of everything that
happened later.
"It turned out that among those ancient bored fishermen several were so
clever and ingenious that, following the principle of that curious game, they
became expert in inventing very long explanations.
"And when one of them discovered how to make what was afterward
called 'parchment' from the skin of the fish called 'shark,' some of these
skillful fellows, just to swagger before their companions, even began
inscribing these long explanations of theirs on these fishskins, employing the
conventional signs invented earlier for another game called 'mousetrap. '
"Still a little later, when these bored fishermen had been replaced by their
descendants, the latter inherited these inscribed fishskins, as well as the craze
for this peculiar game, and these various inventions, both their ancestors' and
their own, were given for the first time the high-sounding name of 'science.'



"And from then on, as the craze for 'cooking up' these 'sciences' passed from generation to generation, the beings of that group whose ancestors had been simple Asiatic fishermen became 'specialists' in inventing sciences of every sort. "These sciences, moreover, also passed from generation to generation and certain of them have reached contemporary beings of that planet almost unchanged. "Hence it is that almost half of what are called the 'egoplastikoori' arising in the Reason of the contemporary beings of that ill-fated planet—from which, in general, what is called a 'world outlook' is formed in beings—are crystallized just from the 'truths' invented by those bored fishermen and their descendants.
"As regards the ancient shepherds who later founded the powerful community called 'Rome,' their ancestors also were often forced, on account of bad weather, to seek refuge for their flocks in sheltered places, and to pass the time together somehow or other. "And so, since they were together, they did a lot of talking But when everything had been talked out and they felt bored, one of them suggested that as a relief they should take up the occupation which they were the first to call cinque contra uno—five against one—a pastime which has been preserved under the same name among their descendants down to the present time. "As long as only the beings of the male sex engaged in that pastime everything went 'smoothly and peacefully,' but when a little later their 'passive halves,' that is to say, their women, joined in and, immediately appreciating it, soon became addicted to it, they gradually attained such 'finesses' in this occupation that if our arch-cunning Lucifer himself were to rack his honorable brains, he could not invent even a tithe of the 'turns' these erstwhile shepherds invented and



prepared for the beings of succeeding generations of that ill-starred planet.
"Now, my boy, when these two independent groups of terrestrial beings
multiplied and, in accordance with the usual aim of all communities there
during all periods of their existence, acquired every variety of 'effective
means' for reciprocal destruction, they began carrying out these processes with
other independent communities—for the most part, of course, with less
powerful communities—and occasionally between themselves.
"Here it is very interesting to note that during intervals of peace between
these two communities—who were almost equal in the possession of efficient
means for reciprocal destruction—the beings of both these groups, whose
places of existence were close to each other, often came into contact and had
friendly relations, with the result that little by little each picked up from the
other those specialties that had originally been invented by their ancestors In
short, the result of the frequent contacts between these two communities was
that the Greek beings, borrowing from the Romans all their refinements of
'sexual turns,' began organizing their what were called 'Athenian nights,' while
the Roman beings, having learned from the Greeks how to cook up 'sciences,'
composed their later very famous 'Roman law.'
"A great deal of time has passed since then The inventors of both those
kinds of being-manifestation have long since disappeared, and their
descendants who chanced to become 'powerful' have also disappeared Yet
now the contemporary three-brained beings of that planet 'fondly' dedicate
more than half their existence and the being-energy they have acquired to
absorbing and actualizing somehow or other, unconsciously and sometimes
even consciously, those two 'ideals' whose initiators were the bored Asiatic
fishermen and shepherds.



"Well then, my boy, later on it seems, when both these groupings of your
favorites had acquired many of the aforementioned 'effective means' for the
successful destruction of the existence of beings like themselves, and had be
come past masters at persuading or coercing the beings of other countries to
exchange their own inner convictions for the ideals invented by their
ancestors, they first conquered the neighboring communities situated on the
continent of Europe, and afterward, with the hordes they had collected during
this time, they turned toward the continent of Asia.
"And there, on the continent of Asia, they first began spreading that
maleficent influence of theirs among the beings populating its western
shores—in whom, as I have already said, being-impulses for a more or less
normal being-existence had been instilled for centuries—and then they
gradually began to advance into the interior.
"Their advance into the interior of the continent of Asia met with great
success, and their numbers constantly increased, chiefly because the learned
beings who had been in Babylon were continuing to infect the Reason of
beings everywhere on that continent with their hasnamussian political ideas.
"What also helped them very much was that there were still preserved in
the instinct of the Asiatic beings the results of the influence of the 'initiates'
and 'priests,' disciples of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, who through
their sermons had inculcated one of the chief commandments of Ashiata
Shiemash, which declared:
'Do not kill another even when your own life is in danger.' "Profiting by this, these former fishermen and shepherds could advance very easily, destroying on their way all those who declined to worship the 'gods' they themselves had



adopted, that is to say, their fantastic 'sciences' and their phenomenal
'depravity.'
"These 'sowers of evil' for all the three-brained beings of all succeeding
generations arising on the continent of Europe—especially the Greeks
moved into the interior of the continent of Asia, progressing slowly to be sure,
yet effectively.
"But when some time later there appeared at the head of these hordes that
arch-vainglorious Greek, the future hasnamuss, Alexander of Macedonia,
there began the clean sweep of the last remnants of the results of the very
saintly intentional labors of our now Common-Cosmic Most Saintly Ashiata
Shiemash—after which it was again, as they say, just the 'old, old story.'
"Although each time the place of the 'center of culture' of your favorites
has changed, a new so-called 'civilization' has arisen, bringing for the beings
of succeeding epochs some new maleficence, nevertheless, not one of these
many 'civilizations' has ever prepared so much evil for the beings of later
epochs, including of course the present one, as that famous 'Greco-Roman
civilization.'
"Without mentioning many other lesser psychic features, unbecoming to
three-brained beings and now existing in the presence of your favorites, that
civilization is chiefly to blame for the complete disappearance, especially
from contemporary beings, of the possibility of crystallizing in their presence
the data for 'sane logical mentation' and for engendering the impulse of
'being-shame. '
"In short, my boy, the 'ancient Greek fantastic sciences' were the cause of
the complete atrophy of the former, and the 'ancient Roman depravity,' of the
latter.
"In the early period of that Greco-Roman civilization, these pernicious
impulses, which by now have become being-impulses, namely, the 'passion
for inventing fantastic sciences' and the 'passion for depravity,' were inherent
in



the Greek and Roman beings alone Later when, as I have already said, the
beings of both these communities chanced to become powerful and began
influencing the beings of other communities, those peculiar and unnatural
being-impulses gradually infected your unfortunate favorites everywhere.
"This took place, on the one hand, as a result of the persistent influence of
these two communities, and on the other, because of that peculiarity of their
psyche—common to all the three-brained beings of that planet and already
well fixed in it before this—which is called 'imitation.'
"And thus, little by little, the psyche of your favorites, already shaky
enough before this, has become so unhinged that in all of them without
exception both their world outlook and the whole ordering of their daily
existence rest and proceed exclusively on the basis of those two 'Greco
Roman inventions,' that is to say, on the basis of 'fantasizing' and of 'striving
for sexual gratification. '
"Here it is very interesting to note that, although the heritage from the ancient
Romans has caused the gradual disappearance from the presence of your
favorites of the 'organic shame' proper to three-brained beings, there has
arisen in its place something rather like it In the presence of your
contemporary favorites there is as much as you want of this 'pseudo being
impulse,' which they also call 'shame,' but the data for engendering it are quite
singular.
"This being-impulse arises in their presence only when they do something
which, under their abnormally established conditions of ordinary being
existence, is considered improper to be done in front of others.
"But if nobody sees them, then nothing they do—even if according to their
own consciousness and their own feelings it is undesirable—gives rise in
them to any such impulse.
"The 'blessings' prepared by the ancient Romans have in



recent times so permeated the nature of your favorites breeding on all the
continents of that ill-fated planet that it is even difficult to say which
contemporary community has inherited the most from these 'obliging'
Romans.
"But as for the inheritance from the ancient Greeks, namely, the passion for
'inventing various fantastic sciences,' this has not become inherent in all the
three-brained beings of our day equally It has passed down only to certain
beings in each of the contemporary large and small communities of that
peculiar planet, but it has passed down chiefly to certain beings of a
community existing there today under the name of 'Germany.'
"Indeed, the beings of this Germany can boldly be declared to be the
'direct heirs of the ancient Greek civilization', for it is they who bring every
kind of new 'science' and 'invention' into contemporary civilization.
"Unfortunately, my boy, the beings of that German community have in
many respects outdone the beings of ancient Greece.
"Thanks to the 'sciences' invented by the ancient Greeks, it was only the
'being-mentation' of other beings that was spoiled and continues to be spoiled.
"But the contemporary beings of the community of Germany have gone
even further, they have become very skillful in inventing 'sciences' that spread
the specific disease of wiseacring among the rest of your favorites, and during
the process of this disease many of them, half-consciously or even quite
automatically, chance to notice some small detail of the common-cosmic
process which actualizes everything existing Then, when they have shared
this information with their colleagues, they together make use of this detail
for vet another 'invention,' thereby adding to the number of 'new means'
which have so accumulated on that planet during the last two centuries that
their total effect has now



become what is called the 'resultant decomposing force,' counterbalancing the 'resultant creative force' of Nature. "And indeed, my boy, it is only owing to the 'sciences' concocted by certain beings of contemporary Germany that the other three-brained beings belonging to all communities have in their turn acquired the possibility of 'inventing ' And almost every day, now here now there, they think up some 'new invention' or 'new means' which they employ in the process of their existence, and they have brought it about that poor Nature there—already enfeebled without this through no fault other own—is scarcely able to actualize her 'evolutionary' and 'involutionary' processes. "In order that you may clearly understand how these contemporary 'beneficiaries' have surpassed their 'benefactors,' I must now tell you also about certain 'means,' widely used there at the present time, which owe their existence exclusively to these 'Nature-helping' heirs of the ancient Greeks. "I will describe certain of these means, now existing and in use everywhere there which have been invented by the beings of that contemporary community of Germany. "I should like to point out, by the way, one very odd phenomenon, which is that these contemporary successors of the ancient Greeks give names to their maleficent inventions which for some reason or other all end in 'me.' "Let us take for example, among the many particularly harmful inventions of the German beings, just those five what are called 'chemical substances' now existing under the names of 'satkaine,' 'aniline,' cocaine,' 'atropine,' and 'alizarine,' all of which are used there at the present time by the beings of all the continents and islands on that planet even, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin says, 'without economizing.' "The first of these 'means, specially invented by the German beings, namely 'satkaine,' is nothing other than 'samookoorooazar,' that is, one of the seven 'neutralizing gases' that arise and are always to be found in the common presence.



of each planet, and which take part in the 'completed crystallization' of every
definite surplanetary and interplanetary formation, and when isolated are,
always and everywhere, what are called 'indiscriminate destroyers of the
already arisen. '
"Concerning this German invention I also learned, among other things, that
a being of that community happened to obtain this gas from some definite
surplanetary and interplanetary formations and, noticing its special property,
reported his discovery to several of his colleagues So, owing to the fact that
there was then proceeding in the presences of all the beings of their
community what is called the 'most intense experiencing' of the chief
particularity of the psyche of the three-brained beings of your planet, namely,
the urgent need to destroy the existence of others like themselves, these
'scientists' thereupon enthusiastically decided to devote themselves to finding
a way of utilizing the special property of this gas for the speedy mass
destruction of the existence of the beings of other communities.
"Having begun their practical research with this aim in view, one of these
'scientists' soon discovered that if this gas were concentrated in a pure state
ready to be released at will in any given space at any given time, it could
serve their purpose admirably.
"That was enough for them, and from then on, during the processes of
reciprocal destruction, this gas, artificially isolated from the general harmony
of the actualization of everything existing, was released in a certain way by
the ordinary beings of that community, just when and where the greatest
number of beings of so-called 'hostile communities' were gathered.
"When this particularly poisonous cosmic substance, intentionally
liberated into the atmosphere under the said conditions, and striving to
reblend with other corresponding cosmic substances, happens to enter the
planetary bodies.



of three-brained beings nearby, it instantly and completely destroys their
existence, or at least permanently damages the functioning of one or another
part of their common presence.
"The second of the chemical substances I enumerated, called 'aniline,' is a
coloring matter that can be used for the dyeing of most of those surplanetary
formations from which the three-brained beings there make all kinds of
objects needed in the process of their ordinary being-existence.
"Although thanks to that 'invention,' your favorites can now dye any object
any color they wish, yet how long these dyed objects last—ah, just here lies
buried their famous Bismarck's 'pet cat. '
"Before that maleficent aniline was invented, the objects produced by your
favorites for their ordinary existence, such as, for instance, 'carpets,' 'pictures,'
and various articles of wool, wood, and leather, were colored with simple
vegetable dyes, which in the course of centuries they had learned how to
obtain, and these objects would last from five to ten or even fifteen of their
centuries But now, thanks to this aniline, or to dyes with other names that
have this aniline as their base, all that remains of these objects after thirty
years or so is only the memory of them.
"And owing to this maleficent aniline, the beings of the community of
Germany have been responsible not only for the rapid destruction of the
products of all the contemporary beings, but also for the nearly complete
disappearance of articles from ancient times from the face of that ill-fated
planet.
"And this was because, for various hasnamussian purposes and for their
famous, as they call them, 'scientific aims,' they set about collecting the
surviving ancient productions from all centuries and, not having the least idea
of how to preserve ancient objects, they only hastened their destruction More



over, they used the 'antiquities' they collected, and still use them, as models for 'cheap goods' known everywhere on that ill-fated planet as 'ersatz.'
"As for the third of those chemical substances they invented, namely 'cocaine,' not only is this 'chemical means' of great assistance to Nature in hastening the decomposition of planetary formations—in this instance, their own planetary bodies—but it also has an effect on the psyche of contemporary beings of the planet Earth surprisingly like that which the famous organ kundabuffer had on the psyche of their ancestors. "In the days when their ancestors still had within them this invention of the
Great Angel Looisos, they were almost always in exactly the same state as the
beings of today when they introduce into themselves this German invention
called 'cocaine. '
"I must point out, my boy, that even though the action of that German invention is similar to the action of the organ kundabuffer, this came about, of course, without any conscious intention on the part of the beings of Germany, they became colleagues of the Great Angel Looisos only by chance. "At the present time almost all the beings who become genuine representatives of contemporary civilization introduce into themselves this 'blessing' of present-day culture very meticulously and with delight and tenderness, and always of course, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin says, 'to the glory of the cloven-hoofed. '
"The fourth of the enumerated chemical substances, namely 'atropine,' is also in great demand there at present. It has a variety of applications, but is most commonly used for a certain exceedingly strange purpose.
"It seems that, thanks as always to the abnormally estab



lished conditions of ordinary being-existence there, the organ of sight of your favorites has acquired the property of finding the faces of others beautiful and pleasing only when they have dark eyes. "And when this chemical substance called 'atropine' is introduced in a certain way into the eyes of beings, the pupils become dilated and the eyes look darker, so most of them introduce this 'atropine' into their eyes in order that their faces may appear beautiful and pleasing to others. "And indeed, my dear boy, those terrestrial beings who employ this German 'blessing' do have very dark eyes until they are forty-five. "I say until forty-five because so far there has never been a case there of a being continuing to use this means who could still see after the age of fortyfive.
'Alizarine,' the fifth and last of these 'inventions,' is also widely used there. "This 'blessing' of contemporary civilization is used chiefly by what are called 'confectioners' and other specialists who prepare for the beings of that planet very 'tasty' articles for their first food. "The confectioners and other professionals who prepare these tasty tidbits for the first food of your favorites use this sure-fire German innovation 'alizarine,' of course unconsciously, for the sole aim of giving these products an enticing appearance—that aim which has become the ideal of the whole of contemporary civilization, and which our honored Mullah Nasr Eddin expresses in the following words 'As long as everything looks fine and dandy to me, what does it matter if the grass doesn't grow?' "In short, my boy, these present-day successors to the beings of ancient Greece, with all their practical 'attainments' based on the 'sciences' they have invented, have become a great help to poor Nature—though only, it is true, in the



process of decomposition. It is not for nothing that our dear Mullah Nasr
Eddin gives the following wise counsel. 'Better pull ten hairs a day out of
your mother's head than not help Nature.'
"Strictly speaking, the capacity to cook up 'fantastic sciences' and to devise
new methods for ordinary being-existence did not pass from the ancient
Greeks to the beings of contemporary Germany alone; the same capacity was
inherited, and perhaps no less, by the beings of another contemporary
community, also independent, and in its turn enjoying dominion.
"This community of your favorites is called 'England.' "There has even passed to the beings of this second contemporary
community, and directly to them alone, one of the most maleficent inventions
of the ancient Greeks, which the English beings have thoroughly assimilated
and put into practice.
"This particularly harmful invention of theirs was called by the ancient
Greeks 'diapharon,' and contemporary beings call it 'sport.'
"I shall tell you about this contemporary 'sport' in as much detail as
possible at the end of this tale; but meanwhile you should know that although
the beings of the community of England also invent in large quantities a wide
range of new objects required by your favorites in the process of their
ordinary being-existence, they do not invent chemical substances as do the
beings of Germany, no . they invent chiefly what are called 'metalwares.'
"Especially in recent times, they have become expert in inventing and
supplying to the beings existing over the whole surface of your planet vast
quantities of all sorts of metalwares, called padlocks, razors, mousetraps,
revolvers, scythes, machine guns, saucepans, hinges, guns, penknives,
cartridges, pens, mines, needles, and many other things of the same kind.



"And ever since the beings of this contemporary community started
inventing these practical objects, the ordinary existence of three-brained
beings of your planet has become, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin describes it,
'not life but free jam.'
"The beings of this community are now the benefactors of the other beings
of your planet, offering them, as they say, 'philanthropic aid,' especially as
regards their first 'being-duty,' namely, that of carrying out from time to time
the process of 'reciprocal destruction.'
"Thanks to them, the discharge of that 'being-duty' has gradually become,
for your contemporary favorites, the 'merest trifle.'
"Before those inventions existed it used to be exceedingly arduous for your
poor favorites to fulfill that 'being-duty,' for they had to spend a good deal of
toil and sweat on it.
"But nowadays, thanks to the contraptions invented by these English
beings, it has become, again in the words of our esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin,
just roses, roses.
"The contemporary beings scarcely need to make any effort whatsoever in
order to destroy completely the existence of beings like themselves
"Sitting quietly in what they call their 'smoking rooms' they can destroy,
just to pass the time, as it were, dozens and sometimes even hundreds of
others like themselves.
"Now, I might as well also tell you a little about the direct descendants of the
beings of the Greco-Roman civilization..
"The descendants of the beings of the once 'great' and 'powerful'
community of Greece still exist today and also have their own independent
community, but they now have scarcely any significance whatever for the
other independent communities there.
"They no longer do what their ancestors did, who were consummate
specialists in 'cooking up' all kinds of fantastic



sciences, and if a contemporary Greek were to produce a new science, the beings of other communities would not pay the slightest attention to it. "And they would pay no attention to it, simply because that community has not at the present time enough 'guns' and 'ships' to be what is called an 'authority' for the other contemporary beings there. "But although these descendants of the former great Greeks, namely, the Greeks of the present day, have lost the knack of being an imaginary authority for other three-brained beings there, they have adapted themselves perfectly on almost all the continents and islands to keeping what are called 'shops' where, without any haste, slowly and gently, they trade in 'sponges,' 'halva,' 'rahat lokoum,' and so forth, and sometimes 'Persian dried fruit,' not forgetting, of course, the dried fish called 'kefal.'
"As for the descendants of the famous Romans, they too continue to arise and exist and, although they no longer even bear the name of their ancestors, they still call the chief center of their community 'Rome.' "The beings of the community established by the descendants of those former shepherds, who later became the great Romans, are now called Italians "Scarcely anything has been inherited from their ancestors by these Italians except that specific being-impulse which the ancient Romans were the first to crystallize in their presences, and which gradually infected all the other threebrained beings on that planet. "At the present time the beings of that community of Italy lead a calm and peaceful existence, doing nothing more than unostentatiously inventing new forms of their harmless and very innocent what is called 'macaroni.'
"Nevertheless, certain beings of that contemporary Italy



have inherited from their ancestors one special and very peculiar property
called 'giving pleasure to others.
"However, they manifest this inherited need of 'giving pleasure,' not
toward beings like themselves but toward beings of other forms.
"In all fairness it must be stated that this special property passed to beings
of various parts of present-day Italy and became ingrained in their nature, not
so much from the great Romans as from their ancestors of considerably later
epochs, that is to say, from the time when they began propagating among
beings, both of their own and of neighboring weaker communities, the
teaching, already distorted for their egoistic purposes, of a certain genuine
sacred Messenger from Above.
"At the present time the beings of various parts of Italy manifest this
property of giving pleasure to others in the following way:
"When they destroy the existence of the quadruped beings called 'sheep'
and 'goats,' whose planetary bodies they use for their first food, they do not do
so all at once, but in order to give them this 'pleasure' they do it 'slowly' and
'gently' over a period of many days, that is, one day they take off one leg, then
a few days later, a second leg, then the third, and so on, for as long as the
'sheep' or 'goat' still breathes And 'sheep' and 'goats' can breathe for a long
time without these parts of their common presence, because although these
parts do not participate in the main functions of the taking in of cosmic
substances required for existence, they do participate in those functions that
engender in all beings the impulses giving self-sensations.
"After what I have just said, there seems to be no need to say more about
the descendants of those Romans, who were once so great and so menacing
for the other communities there.



"Now let us talk about that particularly maleficent invention of the ancient
Greeks which is practiced today by the beings of the community of England,
and which is called 'sport. '
"These beings of contemporary England, who make the most use of this
particularly harmful invention of the ancient Greeks, have thereby added one
more sure-fire factor for shortening the duration of their existence, already
trifling enough without this Furthermore, experiencing in their turn the
'greatness' of their community, they have now become 'authorities' for the
three-brained beings of other communities, and having made the practice of
this invention their ideal and its propagation their aim, they are infecting by
every possible means the beings of all the other large and small communities
of that ill-fated planet.
"The cause of this serious misconception was the disappearance from the
common presence of your favorites of the possibility of the crystallization in
them of those factors which actualize 'logical mentation' in three-brained
beings.
"And since they lack this 'logical mentation,' all of them, almost without
exception, accept the statements of certain candidate hasnamusses affirming
that they can obtain 'something' very beneficial for themselves through 'sport',
and now believing these assertions with all their presence, and in the hope of
obtaining this benefit, they give themselves up entirely to this sport.
"None of these unfortunates know, or probably will ever realize, not only
that this maleficent 'sport' of theirs brings them nothing beneficial but that, as
I have just told you, owing to this sport alone, they shorten still further the
duration of their existence, already sufficiently trifling without this.
"So that you may represent more clearly to yourself and understand why the
duration of their existence is still further



diminished on account of this sport, it is now opportune to explain to you, as I
have promised, the difference between the duration of being-existence
according to the 'fulasnitamnian' principle and according to the principle of
'itoklanotz.'
"You remember that when I explained to you how these favorites of yours
define the 'flow of time,' I told you that when the organ kundabuffer with all
its properties was removed from their presence, and—in conformity with the
'fulasmtamnian' principle—they began to have the same duration of existence
as all normal three-brained beings arising everywhere in our Universe, they
also should without fail have existed until their second being-body, the
'kesdjan body,' had been completely coated in them and perfected in Reason
up to the sacred 'Ishmetch.'
"But later, when they began existing in a manner more and more
unbecoming to three-brained beings and entirely ceased to actualize in their
presence the being-partkdolgduty foreseen by Great Nature, which alone
enables three-brained beings to acquire the data for coating their higher parts,
and when because of this the quality of their radiations failed to respond to the
demands of the most great common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process, then
Great Nature, in order to restore the 'equilibrium of vibrations,' was compelled
gradually to adapt the duration of their existence to the principle called
'itoklanotz,' which in general determines the duration of existence of one
brained and two-brained beings that have not the same possibilities as three
brained beings, and are therefore incapable of actualizing in their presence the
partkdolgduty foreseen by Nature.
"According to this principle, the duration of their being-existence and also
the entire content of their common presence generally depend upon the results
arising from the following seven factors in their surroundings:



1 Heredity in general, 2 Conditions and environment at the moment of conception,
3 The combined radiations of all the planets of their solar system during
their formation in the womb of their productress,
4 The level of being-manifestation of their producers during the period in which they themselves are preparing for responsible age, 5 The quality of being-existence of the beings in the immediate surroundings, 6 The quality of what are called 'teleokrimalnichnian thought waves'
formed in the atmosphere around them—also during the period of
their preparation for responsible age—that is, the sincerely manifested
good wishes and actions of 'beings of the same blood', and finally,
7 The quality of their own 'being-egoplastikoori,' that is, their beingefforts for the transubstantiation in themselves of all the data for obtaining Objective Reason
"The chief particularity of existence according to this principle of
itoklanotz is that in the presence of beings existing according to it, depending
on the enumerated seven exterior factors, there are crystallized in their 'being
localizations' or, as your favorites say, in their 'brains'—which are the central
locations of the sources of manifestation of all the separate independent parts
of their common presence—what are called 'bobbinkandelnosts,' that is to
say, a certain 'something' that gives to these 'localizations' or 'brains' a
definite quantity of possible 'associations' or 'experiencings.'
"And so, my boy, because these contemporary favorites of yours, the
three-brained beings of the planet Earth, now arise only according to the
principle of itoklanotz, there are



crystallized in their brains, from the moment of conception up to the age of responsible beings, these 'bobbinkandelnosts,' with very definite possibilities for actualizing the processes of association. "To throw more light on this question and help you understand it better,
and not to waste time on explanations concerning the very essence and the
forms of functioning of these cosmic actualizations called 'bobbinkandelnosts,'
which are lawfully crystallized in the 'localizations' or 'brains' of beings who
exist only on the basis of itoklanotz, I will take as an example those 'artificial
djamtesternokhi,' which your favorites also have and which they call 'me
chanical watches.'
"As you already know, although these 'artificial djamtesternokhi,' or
'mechanical watches,' are of different systems, they are nevertheless all
constructed on the same principle of the tension or pressure of an unwinding
'spring.'
"One system of djamtesternokhi contains a spring exactly calculated and
set so that its tension while unwinding will last twenty-four hours, another
system has a spring set for a week, a third for a month, and so on.
"The 'bobbinkandelnosts' in the brains of beings who exist only according
to the principle of itoklanotz correspond to the springs in mechanical watches
of different systems Just as the duration of the movement of mechanical
watches depends upon the springs they contain, so the duration of the
existence of beings depends exclusively on the bobbinkandelnosts formed in
their brains at the time of their arising and during the process of their further
formation.
"Just as the spring of a watch is 'wound up' for a definite length of time, so
these beings can 'associate' and 'experience' only to the extent of the
possibilities for experiencing put into them by Nature while these
bobbinkandelnosts are being crystallized in their brains.



"They can associate and consequently exist just so long —no more, no less.
"As mechanical watches can run only for as long as the spring has been
'wound up,' so the beings in whose brains these bobbinkandelnosts are
crystallized can experience, and consequently can exist, only until the
bobbinkandelnosts formed in their brains, in accordance with the mentioned
seven exterior factors, are used up.
"And so, my boy, when the results of partkdolgduty were no longer
obtained in the presence of your favorites, and the duration of their existence
began to depend exclusively on the results of the mentioned seven accidental
exterior factors, then thanks to all this the length of their existence, especially
among contemporary beings, became extremely variable.
"At the present time, it may range from one of their minutes up to seventy
or ninety of their years.
"And so, owing to all I have just said, no matter how your favorites exist,
and no matter what measures they adopt, and even if they were to put
themselves, as they say, 'in a glass case,' as soon as the contents of the
bobbinkandelnost crystallized in one or another of their brains is used up, that
brain immediately ceases to function.
"The difference between mechanical watches and your contemporary
favorites is that in watches there is only one spring, whereas your favorites
have three of these independent bobbinkandelnosts.
"And these bobbinkandelnosts in all three independent 'localizations' of
three-brained beings in general have the following names:
the first the bobbinkandelnost of the thinking center, the second the bobbinkandelnost of the feeling center, and the third the bobbinkandelnost of the moving center.



"Nowadays it frequently happens that the process of the sacred
'rascooarno' in your favorites takes place 'by thirds' —that is to say, they 'die
in parts ' This also proceeds from the fact that, arising and being formed only
according to the principle of itoklanotz and existing inharmoniously, they use
up the contents of the bobbinkandelnosts of their three separate, independent
brains disproportionately, and hence they frequently undergo such a horrible
'dying' as is not proper to three-brained beings.
"During my stay among them I personally very often witnessed their
'dying by thirds.'
"And this can take place because even though the bobbinkandelnost of one
of their brains may be entirely used up, the beings themselves, especially the
contemporary ones, sometimes continue to exist for quite a long time.
"For instance, it often happens that, owing to their particularly abnormal
existence, the contents of one of their bobbinkandelnosts are used up and, if it
is the case of the moving center or, as they themselves call it, the 'spinal cord,'
then although this three-brained being continues to 'think' and to 'feel,' he has
already lost the possibility of intentionally directing the parts of his planetary
body.
"Here it is interesting to note that, when in one of your contemporary
favorites a part finally dies in this way, their 'zirlikners' or, as they are called,
'physicians,' look upon such a death as unquestionably a disease, and begin to
treat it with every kind of wiseacring already proper to them, and they give
these supposed diseases all sorts of names sounding like an ancient language
utterly unknown to them called 'Latin. '
"These widespread diseases there have such names as the following
'hemiplegia,' 'paraplegia,' 'paralysis progressiva,' 'paralysis essentialis,' 'tabes
dorsalis,' 'paralysis agitans,' 'sclerosis disseminata,' and so on and so forth.



"Such a death by thirds has become particularly frequent during the last two
centuries on the planet Earth which has taken your fancy And this occurs to
those of your favorites of all communities there, both large and small, who
either because of their 'professions' or because of one of the 'passions' that
arise in beings on account of the same abnormally established conditions of
their ordinary being-existence— have more or less used up the contents of the
bobbinkandelnosts of one or another of their being-brains.
"For instance, a 'one-third death' through exhaustion of the
bobbinkandelnost of the moving center or spinal cord often occurs among
those terrestrial beings who give themselves up to that occupation practiced
by the beings belonging to the community of England, thanks to the
maleficent invention of the ancient Greeks now called 'sport.'
"You will clearly understand the nature of the pernicious consequences of
that harmful occupation when I tell you that, during my stay among those
favorites of yours, I once devoted a special section of my statistics to
clarifying for myself how long those three-brained beings can exist who take
up the profession of 'wrestling,' and never once did I find a single one who
had existed longer than forty-nine of their years.
"And a 'one-third death' through the premature using up of the
bobbinkandelnost of the feeling center occurs there for the most part among
those beings who become by profession what are called 'representatives of art.'
"Most of these terrestrial professionals, especially the contemporary ones,
at first fall ill with one or another form of what is called 'psychopathy,' and
later, because of their psychopathy, they so to say intentionally 'learn to feel',
thereafter, repeatedly experiencing this abnormal being-impulse, they
gradually use up the contents of the bobbinkandelnost



of their feeling center and, by thus disharmonizing the tempo of their own common presence, bring themselves to that peculiar end which is not often met with even among them. "It is worth mentioning here, by the way, that the 'one-third death' through
the feeling center also occurs among your favorites thanks to a very original
form of 'psychopathy' called 'altruism.'
"And as regards the premature partial death through the bobbinkandelnost
of the thinking center—this kind of death has been occurring more and more
frequently in recent times among your favorites.
"This partial death through the thinking center chiefly befalls those
favorites of yours who try to become, or have already become, 'scientists of
new formation,' and also those who are addicted to reading what are called
'books' and 'newspapers. '
"As a result of reading superfluously and associating only by thoughts, the
contents of the bobbinkandelnost of the thinking center of those three-brained
beings are exhausted before the contents of the bobbinkandelnosts of their
other being-centers.
"And so, my boy, all these misfortunes, such as the shortening of the duration
of their existence and many other maleficent consequences, occur to your
favorites only because they have not yet learned about the cosmic law called
the 'equilibration of differently sourced vibrations. '
"If only such an idea would occur to them and they were to carry on their
usual wiseacrings with it, they would then perhaps discover one very simple
'secret.'
"I am sure that somebody would stumble on this 'secret' because, in the first place, it is simple and obvious, and in the second place, they discovered it long ago and have often put it to practical use.



"They even apply this simple secret to those mechanical watches we took as an example in connection with the duration of their existence. "In all the mechanical watches of various systems, they use this simple secret in a corresponding part of the general mechanism of the watch for regulating the 'tension of the spring,' and it is called, it seems, the 'regulator "By means of this 'regulator' it is possible, for instance, to make the mechanism of a watch that is wound up for twenty-four hours go for a whole month or, on the contrary, run down in five minutes. "In the common presence of every being existing merely on the basis of itoklanotz, there is 'something' similar to the regulator in a mechanical watch, and this 'something' is called 'iransamkeep,' which means 'not to give oneself up to the associations resulting from the functioning of one brain alone. "But even if your favorites should hit upon this simple secret, it would change nothing They still would not make the necessary being-efforts, accessible even to contemporary beings, whereby they can, through the foresight of Nature, acquire the capacity for what is called 'harmonious association,' which alone creates the energy for active being-existence in the presence of every three-brained being and consequently in them also But at the present time, this energy is elaborated in the presence of your favorites only during their quite unconscious state, that is, during what they call 'sleep "But since your favorites, especially the contemporary ones, constantly exist passively under the direction of only one of the separate spiritualized parts of their common presence, and constantly manifest themselves exclusively in accordance with the factors for negative properties also lawfully arising in their common presence, there proceeds in them that same disproportionate expenditure of the con



tents of their various bobbinkandelnosts—that is to say, they always
experience the possibilities of action, placed in them by Nature according to
law, though only in one or two of their brains, and in consequence of this, the
contents of one or two of their bobbinkandelnosts are prematurely exhausted,
whereupon, just like mechanical watches in which the 'spring' has run down
or the force of the 'regulator' has weakened, they cease to act.
"Sometime later, I shall explain to you why it is that when beings who
exist according to the principle of itoklanotz manifest under the direction of
only one or two of their spiritualized sources, and not harmoniously with all
three combined and in agreement, the particular brain in which there has been
an excess of associations is prematurely used up and consequently dies, and I
shall also explain why, owing to this, the other bobbinkandelnosts are
likewise used up, even though they had no part in it.
"But you should also know that one can still occasionally find certain of
your favorites whose planetary existence lasts up to five of their centuries.
"You will then clearly understand that in the case of certain of your
favorites, even of recent times, who somehow find out and correctly
assimilate in their Reason certain details concerning the 'law of associations'
proceeding in the separate brains of beings, as well as the reciprocal action of
these independent associations, and who exist more or less in conformity with
this law, the bobbinkandelnosts formed in their separate being-brains are not
used up, and they thus acquire the possibility of existing much longer than the
other three-brained beings on that planet.
"During my last stay there, I personally met several of these terrestrial
contemporary three-brained beings who were already two or three, or even
four of their centuries old I met them chiefly in a small 'brotherhood'
composed of beings from almost all of their 'religions,' whose per



manent place of existence was in the middle of the continent of Asia.
"The members of that brotherhood, so it seems, discovered the mentioned
'law of associations' in being-brains partly by themselves and partly thanks to
information that reached them from ancient times through genuine initiates.
"As for the beings of the contemporary community of England, who have
become the chief victims of that particularly maleficent invention of the
beings of the ancient Greek civilization, they not only practice it in the
process of their own existence but they try as hard as they can to infect the
beings of all the other communities with this same evil Moreover, by this
maleficent sport of theirs, these unfortunates not only diminish still further the
already trifling duration of their own existence but, in my opinion, they will
eventually bring about the same fate for their community as quite recently
befell a large community there named 'Russia.'
"I thought about this just before my final departure from that planet, when
I learned that the 'power-possessing beings' of this no less great contemporary
community of England were beginning to utilize that maleficent sport for
their own hasnamussian aims, exactly as the 'power-possessing beings' of the
community of Russia utilized for the same aim the famous question of 'vodka.'
"Just as the 'power-possessing beings' of Russia then tried, by every kind
of artifice, to instill into the weak wills of the ordinary beings the necessity
for the intensive use of this 'vodka,' so the 'power-possessing beings' of
England are now maneuvering in every way to infatuate the ordinary beings
of their community with this sport of theirs.
"The forebodings that then arose in me are, it seems, already being justified. "And I draw this conclusion from the etherogram I recently received from
the planet Mars informing me, among



other things, that although there are more than two and a half million of what
are called 'unemployed' beings in that community of England, the 'power
possessing beings' there take no measures concerning this, but only endeavor
to spread still more widely among them that famous 'sport' of theirs.
"Just as in the large community of Russia all the newspapers and
magazines used to publish countless articles on the question of 'vodka,' so now
in the community of England more than half the contents of all these 'sowers
of evil' are devoted to that famous 'sport.' "



CHAPTER 30
Art
A THIS PLACE in his tales, Beelzebub became silent. Then turning suddenly to
his old servant Ahoon, who was sitting there listening as attentively as his
grandson Hassein, Beelzebub said:
"What's this, old man! Are you really listening to me with as much interest
as our Hassein? Weren't you there yourself, and didn't you go with me
everywhere on that planet Earth, and didn't you see with your own eyes and
sense for yourself everything I am telling him about?
"Instead of just sitting there open-mouthed at my tales, why don't you also
tell our favorite something? There is no getting out of it. Since those strange
three-brained beings interest him so greatly, we have to tell him all we can
about them.
"Surely something or other about those freaks must have struck you . . well, whatever it was, tell us about that." On hearing these words, Ahoon thought a little and replied.
"After your subtly psychological tales about all these muddle-heads, what
can I add with my stories?"
But then, with unaccustomed seriousness and borrowing the style and even
entire expressions of Beelzebub himself, he went on:
"Well now . . How shall I put it? My essence was often thrown off balance
by those strange three-brained beings, and their foolish capers nearly always
evoked the being-impulse of amazement in one or another of my spiritualized
parts."
And then addressing Hassein, he said:



"All right, dear Hassein! "I shall not, like His Right Reverence, tell you in detail about any
particular oddity of the psyche of those three-brained beings of our Great
Universe who have taken your fancy No, I shall only remind His Right
Reverence of a certain factor whose origin goes back to the time of our fifth
stay on the surface of that planet, and which, when we returned there for the
sixth and last time, had become the chief reason why, in every one of your
favorites, from the first day of their arising until their formation as
responsible beings, their capacity for normal 'being-mentation' is distorted
step by step, and is finally transformed almost into a 'kaltoosaroo.' "
Thereupon, turning to Beelzebub, with a timid look and in a hesitant tone
he continued:
"Don't blame me, Your Right Reverence, if I venture to express to you an
opinion that has just arisen in me and that is the outcome of data perhaps
already worn too thin for being-conclusions.
"In telling our dear Hassein the various reasons why the psyche of the
contemporary three-brained beings of the planet Earth has been transformed,
as you once deigned to express it, into a 'mill for grinding out nonsense,' you
scarcely even mentioned one factor which, perhaps more than any other, has
contributed to this during recent centuries.
"You yourself were present, as I well remember, at the arising of that
factor during our stay in Babylon—I mean that factor which has since
become definitely maleficent for the contemporary beings there and which
they themselves call 'art. '
"If, in your wisdom, you should consent to take up that question in detail,
then, it seems to me, our dear Hassein would have the ideal material for
elucidating all the peculiar



abnormalities of the psyche of the three-brained beings arising in most recent times on that planet Earth which interests him. Having said this, and wiping the drops of sweat from his forehead with the tip of his tail, Ahoon became silent and resumed his usual expectant posture.
Turning to him with an affectionate glance, Beelzebub said: "Thank you, old man, for reminding me of this. It is true that I have scarcely mentioned that harmful factor they themselves created, which led to the final atrophy of those data for their being-mentation that had by chance still survived in them. "All the same, old friend, although it is true that I have scarcely referred to it so far, this does not mean that I have not considered it We have ample time before us on our journey and, in all probability, in the course of my later tales to our common favorite Hassein, I would have remembered in due time what you have just reminded me about. "However, perhaps it is opportune to speak just now about this contemporary terrestrial 'art' because, as you have said, during our fifth stay there, I actually witnessed the events that gave rise to the causes of this contemporary evil, and that occurred thanks again to those learned beings who were gathered in the city of Babylon from almost the whole surface of that ill-fated planet. "
Beelzebub then turned to Hassein and spoke as follows: "This definite concept, now existing there under the name of 'art,' is one of
those automatically acting data, the totality of which gradually and almost
imperceptibly, yet very surely, converts these unhappy favorites of yours
beings who have in their presence all the possibilities for becoming particles
of a part of divinity—merely into what is called 'live meat.'
"In order to throw light on all aspects of the question of



this famous contemporary terrestrial 'art,' and for your clear understanding of how it all came about, you must first know about two facts relating to what occurred in the city of Babylon during our fifth visit in person to the surface of that planet of yours. "The first fact explains how and why I came to be a witness of those events which served as the basis for the existence among contemporary three-brained beings of the planet Earth of that now definitely maleficent notion called 'art', and the second is related to the earlier circumstances which, in their turn, were the origin of these events. "Concerning the first of these facts, I must tell you that after the events which occurred among those learned terrestrial three-brained beings who had come to Babylon from almost the whole planet—that is to say, after they had split into several independent groups and had become absorbed, as I have already told you, in the question of 'polities'—I resolved to leave Babylon and continue my observations among the beings of the powerful community called 'Hellas ' I therefore decided to learn their 'language' without delay, and from then on I began to visit those places in the city of Babylon frequented by those beings who would be most useful to me in this study. "One day, as I was walking along a certain street not far from our house I
noticed on a large building I had often passed what is called on the Earth a
'signboard,' which had just been put up, announcing that in that building a new
club for foreign learned beings had just been opened, called the 'Adherents of
Legomonism ' On the door was a notice to the effect that the enrollment of
members of the club was still going on, and that all reports and scientific
discussions would be conducted only in the local and Hellenic languages.
"This interested me very much, and at once I thought of the possibility of
making use of this newly opened club for practice in the Hellenic language.



"I then asked certain beings who were going in and out of the building for
particulars concerning the club, and when, thanks to the explanation of one of
these learned beings with whom, as it turned out, I was already acquainted, I
had made it all more or less clear to myself, I then and there decided to
become a member.
"Without thinking long about it, I entered the building and, passing myself
off as a foreign learned being, I asked to be enrolled as an Adherent of
Legomonism I managed to do this very easily, owing to that acquaintance
whom I had met by chance and who, like the others, took me for a learned
being like himself.
"Well, my boy, having thus become, as they say, a 'full member' of this
club, I began to go there regularly, chiefly to talk with those learned members
who were familiar with the Hellenic language I needed to practice.
"Now as regards the second fact I mentioned, this was due to the following
events:
"You must remember that among the learned beings who were then
gathered in Babylon from almost the whole planet, some had been brought
there by coercion by the aforementioned Persian king, and others had come of
their own accord, drawn by that famous question of the 'soul And among the
beings brought there by coercion were some who were not, like the majority,
'learned beings of new formation,' but who, with a sincerity proceeding from
their separate spiritualized parts, strove for high knowledge with the sole aim
of self-perfection.
"Owing to their genuine and sincere strivings, to the corresponding
manner of their existence, and to their being-acts, this small number of
beings, even before their arrival in Babylon, had been considered 'initiates of
the first degree' by those terrestrial three-brained beings worthy to become



'all-rights-possessing initiates according to the renewed rules of the Most Saintly Ashiata Shiemash.' "And thus, my boy, when I began frequenting this club, it became evident
to me, both from conversations with its members and from other data, that
these few terrestrial learned beings, who were sincerely striving to perfect
their Reason, had from the beginning kept to themselves in the city of
Babylon, and never mixed in any of the affairs in which the general mass of
Babylonian scholars very soon became involved.
"These few learned beings kept themselves apart, not only in the
beginning when all the others established a meeting place in the very heart of
Babylon, where for their better mutual support, both material and moral, they
founded a central club for all the learned beings of the Earth, but also later on,
when the whole body of learned beings split into three separate sections, each
having its independent club in a different part of the city, these initiated
beings identified themselves with none of the three sections.
"They existed in the suburbs and scarcely ever met any of the main body
of learned beings, and it was only a few days before I was admitted as a
member that they united for the first time for the purpose of organizing the
club of the 'Adherents of Legomonism. '
"These few learned beings I am speaking of had all without exception
been brought to the city of Babylon by coercion and were for the most part
among those taken by the Persian king from Egypt.
"As I learned later, this union of theirs had been brought about by two
learned beings who were 'initiates of the first degree.'
"One of these two terrestrial initiates, who had his arising among a race of beings called the 'Moors,' was named Kami el-Norkel. The other learned initiate was named Pythagoras,



who had his arising among the Hellenes—those who were afterward called
'Greeks.'
"These two learned beings, as it later became clear to me, happened to
meet in the city of Babylon and, during what is called an 'ooissapagaoomnian
exchange of opinions,' that is, during one of their conversations, the question
arose, 'Which forms of being-existence can serve the welfare of beings of the
future?' They came to the conclusion that in the course of changing
generations of beings on the Earth a very lamentable phenomenon occurs,
namely, that for some reason or other during the processes of reciprocal de
struction called 'wars' and 'popular uprisings,' numbers of initiated beings of
all degrees are invariably destroyed and, together with them, there are also
destroyed forever many legomonisms—the sole means by which information
about former real events on the Earth is transmitted and continues to be
transmitted from generation to generation.
"When these two sincere and honest terrestrial beings ascertained what
they considered so 'lamentable a phenomenon,' they deliberated a long time
and decided to take advantage of the exceptional gathering of so many
learned beings in the same city to confer together for the purpose of finding
some means of averting at least this distressing phenomenon, which
proceeded on the Earth owing to the abnormal conditions of the life of man.
"And it was for this very purpose that they organized that club and called it
the 'Club of the Adherents of Legomonism.'
"So many like-thinking beings at once responded to their appeal that two
days after my admission, the enrollment of new members was closed.
"And on the day when new members were no longer admitted, the number enrolled was 139, and the club continued with this same number of members until the Persian



king abandoned his craze concerning those terrestrial learned beings.
"As I learned on joining the club, all the members present on the opening day
had organized a 'general meeting,' at which it had been unanimously decided
to hold a daily general meeting for reports and discussions dealing exclusively
with the two following questions first, 'What measures should be taken by the
members of the club on their return home in order to collect all the
legomonisms existing in their native lands and to place them at the disposal of
the learned members of the club?' and second, 'What is to be done in order
that the legomonisms might be transmitted to remote generations by some
other means than through initiates alone?'
"Before my enrollment as a member, there had already been a great variety
of reports and discussions concerning those two questions at their general
meetings, and on the day of my admission a great deal was said on the
question of how to attract, for the fundamental task of the club, the
participation of initiated beings from among the followers of various 'paths,'
who were then known as 'onandjiki,' 'shamanists,' 'Buddhists,' and so on.
"Well then, it was on the third day after I became a member of this club
that there was uttered for the first time that word which has chanced to reach
contemporary beings there and which has become one of the potent factors in
the final atrophy of all the data still surviving in them for more or less normal
logical being-mentation, namely, the word 'art,' which then had quite another
meaning and referred to an entirely different idea.
"On that day when the word 'art' was uttered for the first time and its
underlying idea and exact meaning were established, there was listed among
the speakers a Chaldean



learned being, very well known in those times, named Aksharpantziar.
"As the report of that already very aged Chaldean sage, the great
Aksharpantziar, was the origin of all the subsequent events relating to that
famous contemporary art, I will try to recall his speech and repeat it to you as
nearly as possible word for word.
"He spoke as follows: " 'Past centuries, and especially the two last ones, have shown us that
during those inevitable psychoses of the masses leading to wars between
states and popular revolts within states, it invariably happens that many of the
innocent victims of the collective bestiality are those very beings who, owing
to their piety and conscious sacrifices, are worthy to become initiates, and
through whom various legomonisms containing information about real events
that have taken place in the past could be transmitted to the conscious beings
of succeeding generations.
" 'Just such pious men as these always become the innocent victims of the
popular bestiality because, in my opinion, being already free within, they
never wholly identify themselves, as all the others do, with ordinary interests,
and cannot share in the attractions, enthusiasms, and sentiments, or any other
manifestation of those around them, however sincere.
'Because these pious men exist normally, and in their relations with
those around them are always well-wishing in both their inner and outer
manifestations, in ordinary times they acquire the respect and esteem of
everyone But when the mass of people fall into this psychosis and split into
their usual two opposing camps, their Reason becomes bestialized by the
fighting, and they begin to entertain morbid suspicions of just these men who
in normal times have always been unassuming and serious.
'And if the attention of those afflicted with this psychosis



happens to rest a little longer than usual on these exceptional men, they then have no doubt whatever that these serious and outwardly quiet beings have been, even in normal times, neither more nor less than "spies" for their present enemies. 'With their diseased Reason these brutalized men categorically conclude that the seriousness and quietness of these beings were simply "secrecy" and "duplicity. " " 'And no matter to which hostile party they belong, the result of their psychopathic conclusions is that, without any remorse of conscience whatsoever, they put these serious and quiet men to death. " 'This, it seems to me, is the most frequent reason why, in the course of their transmission from generation to generation, the legomonisms about events that really took place on this planet are totally disappearing from the face of the Earth.
'And so, my highly esteemed colleagues, if you wish to know my personal opinion, let me tell you sincerely with all my being that, in spite of everything I have said as regards the transmission of true knowledge to distant generations through corresponding initiates by means of legomonisms, there is nothing whatever that can be changed. " 'Let this form of transmission continue as before, as it has been established on the Earth since the dawn of centuries, and as this form of transmission by initiates through their "ableness to be" was renewed by the great prophet Ashiata Shiemash. 'But if we men of today now wish to render some benefit to men of future times, all we must do is add to this existing means of transmission some new means or other, ensuing from the practices of our contemporary life on the Earth as well as from the experience of former generations over many centuries, in accordance with information that has come down to us.
'I personally suggest that this transmission to future



generations be carried out through the human "afalkalnas," as they are called,
that is, through various works of man's hands which have entered into the
everyday life of people, and also through the human "soldjinokhas," that is,
through various procedures and ceremonies, which have been established for
centuries in the social and family life of people and which pass automatically
from generation to generation.
'Certain of these human "afalkalnas," particularly those made of lasting
materials, may remain intact and be handed down to our remote posterity, or
copies may pass from generation to generation, thanks to the property rooted
in man's essence of giving out as his own, after having changed some minor
detail, works that have reached him from long-past epochs.
'In regard to the human "soldjinokhas," such as various "mysteries,"
"religious ceremonies," "family and social customs," "religious and popular
dances," and so on, although their external forms often change with the flow
of time, the impulses they engender in man, and the manifestations that ensue
from them, always remain the same.
'Therefore, if we insert the useful information and true knowledge we
have already attained within the inner factors that engender these impulses
and manifestations, as well as in the works that I have mentioned, we can
fully count on this knowledge reaching our very remote descendants, some of
whom will decipher it and thereby enable all the others to utilize it for their
good.
'The question now is only this by what means can we bring about such a
transmission through the various human "afalkalnas" and "soldjinokhas"?
'For my part, I propose that this be done through the universal law called
the "Law of Sevenfoldness.”
'The "Law of Sevenfoldness" exists on the Earth and will exist forever
and in everything.



" 'For instance, in accordance with this law, the white ray is composed of
seven independent colors, in every definite sound there are seven different
independent tones, in every state of man there are seven different independent
sensations, furthermore, every definite form can be made up of only seven
different dimensions, every mass remains at rest on the Earth only as a result
of seven "reciprocal thrusts", and so on.
'Well then, we wish that knowledge existing today— both what we have
personally attained and what has reached us from times past, just that
knowledge which all agree will be useful for our remote descendants—be
indicated in some way or other in these human "afalkalnas" and
"soldjinokhas," so that in the future it may be perceived by the pure Reason
of man by means of this great universal law.
'The Law of Sevenfoldness, I repeat, will exist on the Earth as long as
the Universe exists, and it will be seen and understood by men in all times as
long as human thought exists, and therefore it can boldly be said that the
knowledge indicated in this manner in the works of man will also exist
forever on the Earth.
'And as for the method itself, that is to say, the mode of transmission by
the application of this law, this, in my opinion, can be worked out as follows:
'In all the works that we will intentionally create on the basis of this law
for the purpose of transmission to remote generations we shall intentionally
introduce certain 'inexactitudes,' also conformable to law, and in these lawful
inexactitudes we will place, in an intelligible manner, the content of some
true knowledge or other in the possession of men of the present day.
" 'At the same time, to serve as the "key" for deciphering those
inexactitudes in that great law, we will insert in our works something like a
legomonism, and we will secure its



transmission from generation to generation through initiates of a special kind,
whom we shall call "initiates of art. "
'And we shall call them thus because the whole process of such a
transmission of knowledge to remote generations through the Law of
Sevenfoldness will not be natural but artificial.
" 'And so, my most worthy and impartial colleagues " 'It must now be clear to
you that if, for some reason or other, the useful information concerning
knowledge already attained by men about past events on the Earth fails to
reach our descendants through genuine initiates, then thanks to this new
means of transmission I have proposed, men of future generations will always
have the possibility of discovering and understanding for themselves, if not
everything now existing on the Earth, at least those fragments of common
knowledge which chance to reach them through these "works of the hands" of
our contemporaries as well as through those various ceremonies existing
today, in which, in accordance with this great Law of Sevenfoldness, and by
means of these "artificial" indications of ours, we shall now put what we wish.' "
"With these words the great Aksharpantziar concluded his report.
"This speech of his aroused considerable excitement, and a noisy discussion
broke out among all the members of the club of the Adherents of
Legomonism, with the outcome that then and there they unanimously decided
to do as the great Aksharpantziar had suggested.
"A brief interval was then allowed for a meal, after which they all
assembled again, and this second general meeting lasted throughout the night.
"They reached the unanimous decision to begin the following day making
what are called 'minia-images'—or, as the contemporary three-brained beings
call them, 'models'



—of various productions, and to try to devise the most suitable means of indication, on the principles laid down by the great Aksharpantziar, and then to bring these 'minia-images,' or 'models,' of theirs to the club where they would be exhibited and explained to the other members. "Within two days, many of them already began bringing the 'miniaimages' they had made and showing them with the necessary explanations, while others began demonstrating every variety of those procedures which beings of that planet carried out on special occasions in the process of their ordinary existence, as they still do today. "The models they brought included different combinations of colors and various forms of constructions and buildings, and the being-manifestations they demonstrated included the playing of different musical instruments, the singing of every kind of melody, and also the exact representation of certain experiencings foreign to them, and so on and so forth. "Shortly thereafter, for the sake of convenience, the members of the club divided themselves into a number of groups, and devoted each seventh part of the period of time they called a 'week'—or, as they would say, each 'day'—to the presentation and explanation of their productions relating to one particular branch of knowledge. "Here it is interesting to note that this definite period of the flow of time known as a 'week' has always been divided into seven days, and this division was made by the beings of the continent of Atlantis, who expressed in it that same Law of Sevenfoldness, with which they were quite familiar. "On the continent of Atlantis the days of the week were called as follows:
Adashsikra Evosikra Gevorgsikri



Midosikra Maikosikra
Lookosikra Soniasikri
"These names changed many times and at present the beings there name the
days of the week thus:
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday
"Well then, as I have just told you, they devoted each day of the week to
productions in one or another special branch of knowledge—either works of
their hands, or some other form of consciously designed being-manifestation
"Thus, Monday was devoted to the first group, and this day was called the
'day of religious and civil ceremonies',
"Tuesday was allotted to the second group, and was called the 'day of
architecture',
"Wednesday was called the 'day of painting', "Thursday, the 'day of religious and popular dances', "Friday, the 'day of sculpture', "Saturday, the 'day of the mysteries' or, as it was also called, the 'day of the
theater',
"Sunday, the 'day of music and song "On Monday, that is, on the day of religious and civil ceremonies, the
learned beings of the first group demonstrated various ceremonies in which
the 'fragments of knowledge' selected for transmission were indicated by
means of inexactitudes in the Law of Sevenfoldness, chiefly



through inexactitudes in the law-conformable movements of the participants. "Let us suppose, for instance, that the leader of the given ceremony, the priest or, according to contemporaries, the minister, had to raise his arms toward Heaven. "This posture of his infallibly demanded, in accordance with the Law of Sevenfoldness, that his feet should be placed in a certain position, but these Babylonian learned beings intentionally placed the feet of the leader of the ceremony not as they would normally be placed in accordance with this law, but 'otherwise. ' "And in general it was just in these 'otherwises' that the learned beings of this group, by means of a conventional what is called 'alphabet,' indicated in the postures of the participants in the given religious ceremony the ideas they intended to transmit to their remote descendants.
"On Tuesday, the day of architecture, the learned beings belonging to the second group brought various models for buildings and other constructions designed to last a very long time. "And they planned these buildings not in exact accordance with the stability ensuing from the Law of Sevenfoldness, nor as the beings there were mechanically accustomed to do, but 'otherwise.' "For instance, according to all the data, the cupola of a certain construction
had to rest on four columns of a certain thickness and definite strength.
"But they placed this cupola on only three columns, and they calculated the reciprocal thrust—or, as it is also expressed, the 'reciprocal resistance' ensuing from the Law of Sevenfoldness for supporting the surplanetary weight—not from the columns alone, but also from other unusual combinations ensuing from the same Law of Sevenfoldness, which was known to the mass of ordinary beings of that



time, in other words, they calculated the required resistance of the columns
chiefly by taking into account the force of the weight of the cupola itself.
"Or to give another example a certain cornerstone, according to all the data
established there, both mechanically from the practice of centuries and thanks
to the fully conscious calculations of certain beings with Reason, ought in
fallibly to have a definite mass corresponding to a certain force of resistance,
but on the contrary, they cut and set this cornerstone in such a way that it did
not correspond at all to the aforementioned data, and on the basis of the Law
of Sevenfoldness they calculated the mass and force of resistance required for
the support of the superimposed weight from the setting of the lower stones,
which in their turn they did not set according to the established custom but
according to calculations based on the manner of setting the still lower stones,
and so on.
"And it was just by setting these stones in these unusual architectural
combinations derived from the Law of Sevenfoldness that they indicated, also
by means of a conventional 'alphabet,' the content of some useful information
"This group of learned members of the club of the Adherents of
Legomonism also indicated what they wished in their minia-images, or
models, of proposed constructions by utilizing the law called 'Deivibritzkar,'
that is, the law of the 'action of vibrations arising in the atmosphere of en
closed spaces.
"This law, no knowledge of which has reached contemporary beings of that
planet, was then well known to the beings there, who were quite aware that
the size and form of an enclosed space, and also the volume of air it contains,
influence beings in a particular way.
"Utilizing this law, they indicated their various ideas as follows:
"Let us suppose that, in keeping with the character and



purpose of some building or other, and in accordance with the Law of Sevenfoldness and the practice established by centuries, its interior would necessarily evoke certain sensations in a definite lawful sequence. "Then, by utilizing the law of Deivibritzkar, they designed the interior of
this proposed building in such a way that these sensations would be evoked in
the beings who entered, not in the anticipated lawful sequence but in some
other order.
"And it was just in these deviations from the lawful sequence of sensations
that they inserted what they wished to transmit.
"Wednesday, the day of painting, was devoted to the study of the
combinations of different colors.
"On that day the learned beings of this group brought for demonstration all
sorts of objects for domestic use made of very durable colored materials, such
as 'carpets,' 'fabrics,' and 'chinkrooaries,' that is, drawings in various colors on
skins specially tanned to last many centuries.
"On these objects were drawn, or embroidered in many-colored threads,
various scenes of nature on that planet and different forms of beings breeding
there.
"Before continuing to speak about the way in which these terrestrial
learned beings indicated certain fragments of knowledge in their
combinations of colors, I must point out one fact concerning this subject,
which is most distressing for your favorites and which took place in their
presence, again on account of those abnormal forms of daily existence
established by them themselves.
"This fact I wish to explain to you concerns the gradual deterioration in the
quality of those 'organs of perception' which are formed in the presence of
every kind of being, especially the organ that interests us at present, namely,
the organ for perceiving and distinguishing what is called the



'blending of center-of-gravity vibrations,' which reach their planet from the spaces of the Universe. "I am referring to what is known as the 'common integral vibration issuing from all sources of actualizing,' which the learned being Aksharpantziar called the 'white ray,' and also to the separate blendings of 'center-of-gravity vibrations,' which are perceived and distinguished by beings as different 'tonalities of color.' "You must know that from the time of the arising of the three-brained beings of the planet Earth, before the period when the organ kundabuffer was implanted in them, and later when this organ was totally removed from their presence, and even much later, beginning from the second transapalnian catastrophe almost up to the time of our third flight in person to the surface of that planet, the organ of sight was actualized in them with the same 'sensitivity of perception' as in the common presence of all ordinary threebrained beings of the whole of our Great Universe. "During these periods I have mentioned, in all the three-brained beings arising on your planet, this organ was formed with the requisite sensitivity to perceive the blendings of the separate 'center-of-gravity vibrations' of the 'white ray,' and to distinguish one-third of all the 'tonalities of color' found in general in the presences of the planets as well as in all other cosmic concentrations, great and small. "Objective Science has precisely established that the number of separate
blendings of 'center-of-gravity vibrations' issuing from the 'common integral
vibration,' that is, the number of 'tonalities of color' is exactly equal to one
'hooltanpanas' which, according to the calculations of the terrestrial three
brained beings, would amount to 5, 764, 801 tonalities.
"Only a third of this total number of blendings or tonalities—with the exception of the one tonality which is accessible only to the perception of our All-Autocratic



Endlessness—that is, 1, 921, 600 tonalities, can be perceived as 'different colors' by all ordinary beings on whatever planet of our Great Universe they arise. "But if the three-brained beings complete the perfecting of their highest part, and their organ for the perception of visibility thereby acquires the sensitivity of what is called 'olooestesnokhnian sight,' they can then distinguish two-thirds of the total number of tonalities existing in the Universe which, according to terrestrial calculation, amounts to 3, 843, 200 different tonalities of color. "And only those three-brained beings who perfect their highest being-part to the state of what is called 'Ishmetch' become able to perceive and distinguish the total number of blendings or tonalities, with the exception of that one tonality which, as I have already told you, is accessible to the perception of our All-Maintaining Creator alone. "Although I intend to explain to you later in detail how and why in the presences of 'insapalnian cosmic concentrations' every definite formation acquires, from evolving and involving processes, the property of producing various effects upon this organ of beings, nevertheless I do not consider it superfluous to touch upon this question now. "First of all it must be said that the 'common integral vibration,' like every already definite cosmic formation, is formed according to the completed result of the fundamental cosmic law of the holy Heptaparaparshinokh, namely, that cosmic law which the three-brained beings of the planet Earth of the Babylonian period called the 'Law of Sevenfoldness', in other words, this vibration consists of seven complexes of results or, as is sometimes said, seven 'classes of vibrations' issuing from cosmic sources, whose arising and further action depend on seven other sources, which in their turn arise and depend on seven further ones, and so on right up to the first most holy, unique, seven-propertied vibration issuing from the Most Holy Prime Source.



And all these together compose the 'common integral vibration' of all sources of
actualization of everything that exists in the Universe, and later, thanks to
their transformations, they actualize in the presences of the cosmic
insapalnian concentrations the number of different tonalities of color I have
mentioned.
"As for the details of the 'most holy, unique, seven-propertied vibration,'
these you will understand only when I have explained to you in its proper
time, as I have already many times promised you, all about the great
fundamental laws of world-creation and world-maintenance.
"And meanwhile, as regards this question, you ought to know that when
this 'common integral vibration,' which the terrestrial three-brained beings call
the 'white ray,' enters with the presence proper to it into the spheres of its
possible transformation in the presence of an insapalnian planet, there occurs
in it, just as in the case of every definite cosmic arising having the possibility
of further actualization, that cosmic process called 'djartklom', that is to say, it
itself remains as a presence, but its essence disintegrates, as it were, and en
genders processes for evolution and involution by the separate 'center-of
gravity vibrations' of its arising, and these processes are actualized thus
certain groups of 'center-of-gravity vibrations' separate themselves from the
others and are transformed into third ones, and so on.
"During these transformations, the 'common integral vibration,' or 'white
ray,' acts through its 'center-of-gravity vibrations' upon other ordinary
processes taking place nearby in intraplanetary and surplanetary arisings and
decompositions, and owing to 'kindred vibrations,' and in accordance with
surrounding conditions, its center-of-gravity vibrations blend and become part
of the common presence of these definite intraplanetary or surplanetary
formations in which these processes are taking place.
"So, my boy, during my personal descents to the planet



Earth, I noted, at first without any conscious intention on the part of my
Reason, and later I quite intentionally verified, the progressive worsening of
this being-organ in all your favorites.
"Deteriorating century by century, the 'sensitivity of perception' of that
organ, by means of which there chiefly proceeds in the presence of three
brained beings what is called the 'automatic saturation by externals'—which
serves as the basis for the possibility of natural self-perfecting—had been
diminished to such a point that at the time of our fifth stay there, during the
period called by contemporary beings the period of the 'greatness of Babylon,'
your favorites could perceive and distinguish the blendings of the 'center-of
gravity vibrations' of the white ray at most up to the third degree of its
'sevenfold strata,' that is, only up to 343 different tonalities of color.
"Here it is interesting to note that quite a number of the three-brained beings
of the Babylonian epoch already suspected the gradual deterioration of the
sensitivity of this organ of theirs, and certain of them even founded a new
society in Babylon, which launched a peculiar 'movement' among the painters
of that time.
"This peculiar 'movement' had the following program to find out and
elucidate the truth only by means of the tonalities existing between white and
black.
"And they executed all their works using exclusively the tonalities from
black to white.
"When I found out about that particular 'movement' among the Babylonian
painters, they were already using about fifteen hundred quite distinct shades
of the color 'gray. '
"This new 'movement' in painting made a great stir among the beings who
were striving to learn truth at least in something, and it even gave rise to
another and still more



peculiar 'movement,' this time among the beings then known in Babylon as
'olfactorists,' who studied and devised new combinations of 'concentrations of
vibrations' acting in a particular way on the sense of smell of beings, and
producing definite effects on their general psyche, that is to say, among those
beings who made it their aim to find the truth by means of smells.
"Certain enthusiasts of this study, in imitation of the followers of the new
'movement' in painting, founded a similar society, the stated purpose of which
was: 'to seek the truth in the nuances of smells given off between the moment
of the action of cold at freezing and the moment of the action of heat at
decomposition.'
"As the painters had done with colors, they also found between these two
limits of smell about seven hundred very definite gradations, which they
employed in their experiments.
"I do not know where these two peculiar 'movements' in Babylon would
have led, if a newly appointed mayor of the city, soon after our arrival there,
had not started prosecuting the followers of that second 'movement' since, with
their already sufficiently keen sense of smell, they had begun to get wind of
and unwittingly to expose certain of his 'shady dealings,' with the result that he
used every possible means to suppress everything connected not only with that
second 'movement,' but with the first as well.
"As regards that organ of theirs about which we began to speak, namely, the
organ for perceiving the visibility of cosmic arisings outside themselves, the
deterioration of its sensitivity continued after the Babylonian period and
reached such a point that during our last stay on the surface of this planet your
favorites, instead of the 1, 921, 600 'tonalities of color' which they ought to
have perceived, had the possibility of perceiving and distinguishing only the
result of the



penultimate 'sevenfold crystallization of the white ray,' that is, forty-nine tonalities, and even then only some of your favorites had that capacity, while the rest, perhaps the majority, were deprived even of that. "But what is most interesting as regards the progressive deterioration of
that most important part of their common presence is the sorry farce that
results, which is that those contemporary three-brained beings who can still
manage to distinguish this miserable fraction of the total number of
tonalities—merely forty-nine—look down with disdain and self-conceit upon
those other beings who have lost the capacity to distinguish even this
insignificant number, as upon beings with an abnormal deficiency in that
organ, and speak of them as afflicted by the disease called 'Daltonism.'
"The last seven blendings of the 'center-of-gravity vibrations' of the 'white
ray' were called in Babylon, just as now among the contemporary beings of
that planet, by the following names:
Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet
"Now listen to the way in which the learned beings belonging to the group of
painters indicated the useful information and various fragments of knowledge
they had attained, through lawful inexactitudes of the great cosmic law called
the 'Law of Sevenfoldness,' by means of the combinations of these seven
independent definite colors and other, secondary tonalities derived from them.
"In accordance with that definite property of the 'common



integral vibration,' or the 'white ray,' during the process of its transformations
about which I have just spoken and which was already familiar to the learned
Babylonian painters, each of its 'center-of-gravity vibrations' or one of the
separate colors of the 'white ray' always ensues from another and is
transformed into a third, for example, the color orange is obtained from red,
and in turn passes into yellow, and so on and so forth.
"So, whenever these learned painters of Babylon made their pictures, or
wove or embroidered with colored threads, they arranged the different
tonalities—whether lengthwise or crosswise or at the points of intersection of
the lines of color—not in the lawful sequence in which this process normally
takes place in accordance with the Law of Sevenfold-ness, but 'otherwise', and
it was in these equally lawful 'otherwises' that they placed the substance of
certain information and knowledge.
"On Thursday, namely, the day dedicated to sacred and popular dances, the
learned beings of this group presented with the necessary explanations all
possible forms of religious and popular dances, some already in existence
which they only modified, and other quite new ones created by them.
"And in order that you should have a better idea and understanding of the
way in which they indicated what they wished in these dances, you must know
that the learned beings of this time had long been aware that, in accordance
with the Law of Sevenfoldness, every posture or movement of any being
always consists of seven 'mutually balanced' tensions arising in seven
independent parts of his whole presence, and that each of these seven parts in
their turn consists of seven different what are called 'lines of movement,' and
that each line has seven what are called 'points of dynamic concentration', and
finally that all this is repeated in the same



way and in the same sequence, but always on a diminishing scale, down to the
minutest particles of the whole body, called 'atoms.'
"And so, in the movements of their dances, which were lawful in their
accordance with each other, these learned dancers inserted intentional
inexactitudes, also lawful, indicating in them in a certain order the
information and knowledge they wished to transmit.
"On Friday, the day devoted to sculpture, the learned beings belonging to this
group brought and exhibited minia-images, or models, made from a material
called 'clay.'
"Those minia-images, or models, which they brought for exhibition
represented, as a rule, beings like themselves, singly or in groups, or beings of
all sorts of other exterior forms breeding on their planet.
"Among these works were also various 'allegorical beings,' represented
with the head of a being of one form, the body of another, the limbs of a third,
and so on.
"The learned beings of this group indicated all that was necessary by the
introduction of lawful inexactitudes in connection with what was then called
the 'law of proportions.'
"You should know that all the three-brained beings of the Earth, and
especially of course the sculptors of that period, already knew that, in
accordance with the great Law of Sevenfoldness, the dimensions of any
specific part of any whole being derive from the seven dimensions of other,
secondary parts, which in their turn derive from seven tertiary parts, and so on
and so forth.
"Therefore, the dimensions of each large or small part of the whole
planetary body of a being are larger or smaller in exact proportion to the
dimensions of the other parts.
"For a clear understanding of what I have just said, the face of any threebrained being can serve as a good example.
"The facial dimensions of every three-centered being in



general, as also the facial dimensions of the three-centered beings of the planet Earth, are the result of the dimensions of the seven fundamental parts of the whole body, and the dimensions of each separate part of the face are the result of seven different dimensions of the whole face. For example, the dimensions of the nose of any being are determined by the dimensions of the other parts of the face, and this nose in its turn has seven definite what are called 'surfaces,' and these surfaces also have seven lawful dimensions, down to the atom itself of this face of theirs, which is one of the seven independent dimensions of the whole planetary body. "Now it was in the deviations from these lawful dimensions that the learned sculptors among the members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism indicated all kinds of useful information and fragments of knowledge that they intended to transmit to beings of remote generations.
"On Saturday—the day of the mysteries, or the day of the theater—the demonstrations that were given by the learned members of this group were the most interesting of all and, as is said, the most 'popular.' "I myself also preferred these Saturdays to all the other days of the week
and tried not to miss one of them I preferred them because the demonstrations
given on those days by the beings of this group frequently provoked such
spontaneous and sincere laughter among all the other members of this section
of the club that I sometimes forgot which three-centered beings I was with,
and allowed that being-impulse to manifest itself in me which properly arises
only among beings of the same nature.
"At the outset, the learned beings of that group demonstrated before the other members of the club various forms of being-experiencings and manifestations. Then all of them together selected from these demonstrations what best corresponded to different details of one or the other mystery



already in existence or newly created by themselves, and only afterward, by means of intentionally allowed deviations from the principles of the Law of Sevenfoldness in the being-experiencings and manifestations that they reproduced, did they indicate what they wished to transmit. "In this connection it must be noted that although in former times 'mysteries'—some of which contained many instructive ideas known to antiquity—did sometimes happen to reach beings of later epochs, having passed automatically from generation to generation, in recent times those mysteries in which the learned members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism intentionally introduced all manner of knowledge, calculating that it would reach their remote posterity, have almost totally ceased to exist. "The mysteries that had been incorporated in the process of the ordinary existence of your favorites many centuries earlier began to disappear soon after the Babylonian period At first their place was taken by what are called 'kesbaadji' or, as they are now called on the continent of Europe, 'puppet plays,' but afterward they were completely supplanted by the 'theatrical shows' or 'spectacles' that at present are one of the forms of that contemporary art of theirs which has a particularly maleficent action in the progressive shrinking of their psyche. "These theatrical spectacles came to replace the mysteries at the beginning
of the contemporary civilization after the beings, to whom only 'odds and
ends' of information had passed down about the activities of the learned
Babylonian 'mysterists,' began trying to imitate them and set about doing, as
it were, the same thing.
"From then on, the other beings called these imitators of the mysterists by such names as 'players,' 'comedians,' 'actors,' and nowadays they even call them 'artists,' of whom, I may say, very many have sprung up during recent times.



"Well then, these learned beings of Babylon belonging to the group of
mysterists indicated a variety of useful information and knowledge they had
attained by means of what is called the 'flow of associative movements' of the
participants in these mysteries.
"Although the terrestrial three-brained beings of that time were well
acquainted with the law of the 'flow of associative movements,' no
information whatever about these laws has reached contemporary beings.
"Since this 'flow of associative movements' does not proceed in the
presence of the three-brained beings who please you in the same way as in the
presence of other three-brained beings in general, and since there were quite
special reasons for this, proper to them alone, I must first of all explain it to
you in rather more detail.
"The process itself is the same in them as in us, but in us it takes place only
when we are intentionally resting in order to allow the whole functioning of
our common presence to be free to transform, without hindrance from our
will, every variety of being-energy required for an all-round active existence,
whereas in them these various being-energies can now arise only during their
total inactivity, that is, during what they call their 'sleep,' and then of course
only after a fashion.
"However, like all other three-brained beings of the whole of our Great
Universe, they consist of three separate independent spiritualized parts, each
having a central place of concentration for all its functioning in a localization
of its own, which they call a 'brain ' Thus every impression, whether coming
from without or arising from within, is perceived independently, in
accordance with its nature, by each of these brains of theirs And afterward
as is also proper to the presence of every kind of being without distinction of
brain-system—these impressions, together with



previous ones, form a totality of data which, thanks to accidental shocks, evoke an independent association in each of these separate brains. "So, my boy, ever since your favorites completely ceased consciously to
actualize in their common presence being-partkdolgduty—owing to which
alone there can arise in beings, from associations of various kinds, what is
called a 'sane comparative mentation' as well as the possibility of conscious
active manifestation—their separate brains, already associating quite
independently, have engendered in one and the same common presence three
being-impulses of different sources, and thanks to this, they gradually have
acquired, as it were, three personalities having nothing in common with each
other in respect of needs and interests.
"More than half of all the anomalies arising in the general psyche of your
favorites, particularly in recent times, are due in the first place to the process
occurring in their entire presence of three different kinds of independent
associations, evoking in them being-impulses from three localizations of
different natures and properties, and in the second place to the connection that
exists between these three separate localizations, in them as in the presence of
every kind of three-brained being, and which is predetermined by Great
Nature for other functionings of their common presence, and finally, to the
fact that every impression perceived and sensed, that is, every shock, arouses
associations of three different kinds of impressions in the three localizations,
and consequently evokes three totally different kinds of being-impulses in one
and the same presence So, on account of all this, a number of experiencings
are almost always proceeding in them simultaneously, and each by itself
evokes in their whole being a desire for a corresponding manifestation, and
thus is actualized a corresponding movement in accordance with the separate
parts of their whole presence.



"And these associative experiencings of different sources proceed in their common presence and flow one from the other also in accordance with the Law of Sevenfoldness.
"The learned members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism in Babylon who belonged to this group indicated the knowledge they wished to transmit in the movements and actions of those taking part in the mysteries in the following way: "For instance, in fulfilling his role in a given mystery according to lawful associations, a participant, as a result of some new impression evoked in one or another of his brains, ought to have reacted by some particular manifestation or movement, but instead, he would intentionally enact the manifestation or movement not as it ought to have been done in accordance with the Law of Sevenfoldness, but 'otherwise', and in these 'otherwises' the learned beings of this group inserted in a definite way what they wished to transmit to distant generations. "And now, my boy, in order that you should have a concrete picture of these Saturday demonstrations, which I was always glad to attend as a rest from my intense activities at that time, I will tell you how these learned mysterists demonstrated before the other learned members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism various being-experiencings and manifestations according to the flow of associations, from which certain fragments were selected for future mysteries. "For these demonstrations they constructed in one of the large halls of the club a specially raised platform, which they then called the 'reflector of reality,' but beings of later epochs, who chanced to receive information about these learned Babylonian mysterists and began imitating them and doing, as it were, the same thing, called and still call this sort of construction a 'stage. '



"Well then, at the beginning, two of the participants would always come
onto this 'reflector of reality' or 'stage', and then usually one of them would
stand for a while and, as it were, listen to his own 'dartkhelkhloostnian' state
or, as it is sometimes called, the state of his own inner 'associative psychic
experiencings. '
"Listening in this way, it would become clear to his Reason that, for
instance, the sum total of his associative experiencings took the form of an
urgent impulse to punch the face of another being, the sight of whom always
aroused in him by association a certain series of impressions already present
in him, which invariably evoked in his general psyche disagreeable emotions,
offensive to his 'conscious feeling of himself.'
"Let us suppose that these disagreeable experiencings are always produced
in him when he sees a 'trodokhakhoon,' a professional whom contemporary
beings there call a 'policeman.'
"As soon as this 'dartkhelkhloostnian' psychic state and impulse of his
become perfectly clear to his Reason, he recognizes, on the one hand, that in
existing conditions of external social existence it is impossible for him to
gratify this impulse to the full, and on the other hand, being already perfected
in Reason and thus well aware of his dependence on the automatic
functioning of the other parts of his common presence, he understands clearly
that the fulfillment of some urgent being-duty of great importance to those
around him is contingent on the gratification of this impulse And having
thought over everything in this way, he decides to gratify this urge of his as
best he can by doing at least a 'moral injury' to that 'trodokhakhoon,' that is,
by evoking in him associations of an offensive nature.
"With this object in view, he turns to the other learned being who had
come onto the stage with him, and treating him now as a 'trodokhakhoon' or
policeman, he says:



'Hey, you! Don't you know your duty? Don't you see what's going on over there ?' With this, he points in the direction of another room of the club where the other participants in the demonstrations of that day are waiting 'Those two fellows, a "soldier" and a "cobbler," are fighting in the street, disturbing the public peace, and here you are leisurely strolling about imagining yourself God knows who and leering at the passing wives of honest and respectable citizens! Just you wait, you scamp! Through my chief, the head medical officer of this city, I'll have you reported to your chief for negligence and breach of duty!' "From that moment, the learned being who had spoken would assume the role of a physician because he had chanced to call his superior the 'chief medical officer' of the city, while the second learned being who had been called a 'policeman' would become a 'policeman ' Two other learned participants would then immediately be called from the other room by the one who had assumed the role of policeman, and would take the roles of 'cobbler' and 'soldier. ' "And these two latter learned beings would have to manifest themselves in these roles only because the first learned being, who in accordance with his 'dartkhelkhloostnian' state had assumed the role of a physician, had called them 'cobbler' and 'soldier. ' "Well then, these three learned beings who were thus cast impromptu by the first, and were obliged to represent every kind of perception and manifestation lawfully corresponding to types foreign to them or, as your favorites would say, to play 'borrowed roles'—namely, the roles of 'cobbler,' 'soldier,' and 'policeman'—went on to enact their experiencings and the reflex-manifestations resulting from them, thanks to the being-property called 'ikhriltatzkakra,' a property well known to the learned beings of the planet Earth of that period, who had already perfected their presence up to the ableness of actualizing this property.



"Three-centered beings can acquire this being-property called 'ikhriltatzkakra' only after having personally acquired in their presence what is called 'egoaitoorassian will,' which in turn can be obtained only thanks to being-partkdolgduty, that is, to conscious labor and intentional suffering. "So, in this way the learned members of the group of mysterists then in Babylon became players of 'borrowed roles' and demonstrated before the other members of the club the experiencings, and the actions ensuing from them, produced under the direction of their well-informed Reason. "And then, as I have said, with the other members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism who were present, they selected from the beingimpulses thus demonstrated those which best corresponded to their aim, and which had to be experienced and manifested in specific actions according to the law of the flow of associations coming from different sources, and only then did they include those selected in the details of some particular mystery. "Here it is important to emphasize that the learned three-brained beings who belonged to the group of the mysterists in Babylon did indeed reproduce amazingly well and accurately the subjective features of the perceptions and manifestations of various types foreign to them. "And they were able to do this not only because they possessed the beingproperty of 'ikhriltatzkakra,' but also because, like all the learned beings of the planet Earth of that time, they were well versed in what is called the 'law of type,' and were well aware of the twenty-seven quite distinct types of threebrained beings on their planet, and even of what the beings of each type would inevitably perceive in this or that situation, how they would perceive it, and what would have to be their reaction. "As regards this being-property called 'ikhriltatzkakra,' I must add that only this property gives beings the possibility of restraining themselves within the limits of the impulses



and promptings evoked at any given moment in their common presence by
the associations flowing from that brain in which they themselves have
consciously set in motion one or another series of impressions already present
in them, and it is only thanks to this property that beings have the possibility
of perceiving all the details of the psyche of a 'type' they have thoroughly
studied and of manifesting themselves according to that type and fully imper
sonating it.
"In my opinion, the absence of just that property has caused most of the
anomalies that have resulted in your three-brained favorites becoming
possessed of such a strange psyche.
"You must know that in the presence of the three-brained beings there
today, as in the presence of every kind of three-brained being in general, all
new impressions accumulate in the three separate brains in the order of what
is called 'kinship,' and afterward take part—along with impressions previously
registered—in the associations evoked in these three separate brains by every
new perception in accordance with and depending on the 'center-of-gravity
impulses' present in them at that moment.
"So, my boy, in view of the fact that there is a continuous flow in the
presence of your contemporary favorites of three kinds of independent
associations, which likewise continue to evoke different kinds of being
impulses, and furthermore, that your favorites have entirely ceased to
actualize consciously all those cosmic results by means of which alone the
being-property of 'ikhriltatzkakra' can be acquired in three-brained beings,
then in view of all this, the common presence of each of your contemporary
favorites during the process of his existence consists, as it were, of three quite
separate personalities, which have and can have nothing in common in respect
of either the nature of their arising or their manifestations.



"Hence there proceeds in their common presence that particularity of
theirs, which is that with one part of their essence they always wish one thing,
at the same time with another part they definitely wish something else, while
thanks to the third part, they actually do something quite different.
"In short, what takes place in their psyche is just what our dear teacher
Mullah Nasr Eddin defines by the term 'a real mish-mash. '
"To return to the demonstrations of the Babylonian learned beings
belonging to the group of the mysterists, I must add that in the course of the
action the number of participants gradually increased as other colleagues
joined in to meet the demands of various intentionally evoked associative
happenings.
"Besides accurately representing the perceptions and automatic
manifestations of the role that happened to be allotted to him, and which were
proper to the personality of a type quite foreign to him, each participant had to
manage while he was fulfilling that role to find some plausible pretext for
going out to change into a corresponding costume.
"And they changed their costumes in order to manifest themselves more
clearly and in a more striking way in the fulfillment of their roles, so that the
other members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism who verified and
selected the fragments for the future mysteries could follow the action more
easily and make the best selection from everything they saw.
"On Sunday, namely the day dedicated to music and song, the learned beings
belonging to this group produced every kind of 'melody' on various 'sound
producing instruments,' as well as with their voices, and then explained to all
the other learned beings how the knowledge they wished to transmit was
indicated in these works of theirs.



"They also had in view to implant these works in the customs of different
communities, calculating that the melodies they created, passing from
generation to generation, would reach men of the remote future who, in
deciphering them, would discover a knowledge attained on the Earth long
before and use it for the good of their ordinary existence.
"Before telling you how the learned beings of this group inserted their
indications in these instrumental and vocal productions, I must first explain
certain particularities of the perceptive organ of hearing in the common
presence of every kind of being.
"Among these particularities is the property called 'vibroechonitanko. '
"You must know that those parts of the brains of beings which Objective
Science calls 'khlodistomaticules'—certain of which the learned physicians on
your planet call 'cerebral nerve ganglia'—are composed of crystallized
'nirioonossian vibrations,' which in general arise in every being once his
formation is complete, as a result of the process of all kinds of perceptions by
their organ of hearing, and these 'khlodistomaticules,' under the action of
similar but not yet crystallized vibrations, engender in the corresponding
region of a given brain the property of 'vibroechonitanko' or, as it is
sometimes called, 'remorse. '
"In accordance with the foresight of Great Nature, these
'khlodistomaticules' serve in the presence of beings as factors enabling the
arising of the process of association at those moments when inner promptings
are absent or stimuli from outside do not reach their brains.
"As for the still uncrystallized 'nirioonossian vibrations' that enter the
common presence of beings, these are emitted either by the 'vocal cords' of
every kind of being or by certain artificial sound-producing instruments they
have invented.
"When the vibrations arising from those sources enter the



presence of beings and touch the 'khlodistomaticules' of one or another brain, they produce, in relation to the general functioning of the whole being, this process of 'vibroechonitanko. ' "The second particularity of the functioning of the perceptive organ of hearing is that in general the vibrations obtained from the sequence of sounds of any melody evoke associations in the presence of beings in just that one of the three brains in which at that moment the 'momentum of what has just been experienced' is sustained most intensely, and as a result the sequence of impulses evoked for inner experiencing usually follows an automatic order.
"Well then, these learned musicians and singers in the city of Babylon combined their melodies in such a way that the sequence of vibrations of the sounds would evoke in beings a sequence of associations, and therefore impulses for inner experiencings, not in the usual automatic order, that is to say, they combined the melodies so that the sequences of vibrations, on entering into the common presence of beings, would evoke the 'vibroechonitanko' in the 'khlodistomaticules' not of just one brain, as usually takes place—namely, the brain in which the associations predominate at the given moment—but now in one brain, now in another, and now in the third Further, they predetermined the quality or, as they say, the 'frequency of vibrations' of the sounds which would affect one or another brain. "They were completely familiar with all this, that is, they knew from
which vibrations data are formed in this or that brain of the beings, and for
which new perceptions these data might serve as what are called 'determinants
of new results.
"Owing to the combinations of sequences of sounds, there arose simultaneously in the presence of beings different sorts of impulses evoking various contradictory sensations,



which in their turn gave rise to unusual experiencings and reflex movements not proper to them. "And indeed, my boy, the sequence of sounds they combined did have an exceedingly strange effect on all the beings whose presence they entered "Even in me, a being cast, as they would say, 'in another mold,' various being-impulses were engendered, and followed one another in an unusual sequence. "And this happened because the sounds of their melodies, combined in a definite sequence, upon entering my common presence underwent 'djartklom' or, to put it in another way, the sounds were 'sorted out' and acted equally upon my 'khlodistomaticules' of all three sources, with the consequence that the associations in my three independent brains—coming from similar but differently natured series of impressions—although proceeding simultaneously and with an equal intensity, engendered in my presence three quite different promptings. "For instance, the localization of my consciousness or, as your favorites would say, my 'thinking center,' engendered in my common presence, let us suppose, the impulse of 'joy', the second localization in me, or my 'feeling center,' engendered the impulse called 'sorrow', and the localization of the body itself or, as once again your favorites would call it, my 'moving center,' engendered the impulse of 'religiousness.' "And it was just in these unaccustomed impulses, evoked in the beings by their instrumental and vocal melodies, that the learned members of that group indicated what they wished to transmit.
"And so, my boy, after all I have related, I imagine you have enough material to understand why and how, during my fifth stay in person on your planet, I happened to be a



witness of the events that gave rise to that famous word 'art,' and in what connection it was first used and what meaning was given to it in that period which your contemporary favorites call the 'Babylonian civilization.' "I shall now speak about certain facts, the knowledge of which will enable you to picture clearly to yourself and understand how greatly the 'logical mentation' in all these three-brained beings pleasing to you has deteriorated, and in so short a time that, without the least resistance on the part of their individuality, they have allowed themselves to become the 'slaves' of those few 'nonentities' among them who, having totally lost the divine impulse of Conscience, have created for their egoistic aims from this empty word 'art' that chanced to reach them an 'unerring factor' for the final atrophy in all of them of the data still surviving for conscious being. "During the period of my sixth and last stay there in person, I heard everywhere about this contemporary 'art' of theirs and came in contact with its results, and when I had made clear to myself what it was all about, I recalled my Babylonian friends of an earlier time and their good intentions toward their remote descendants, and set about verifying in detail, whenever opportunities arose, just what were the results of everything I had happened to witness, which I have just been telling you about. 'Initiating you now into the impressions, kept secret from strangers, which became fixed in my common presence during my last stay in person on the surface of your planet as a result of my conscious perceptions of this contemporary 'art' of theirs, my 'I,' with a profound being-impulse of pity, must now emphatically state that of all the fragments of knowledge attained by the beings of the Babylonian civilization—fragments which, it must be admitted were rich in content for the good of ordinary existence—abso



lutely nothing has reached the beings of contemporary civilization apart from
a few empty words without any inner content.
"Not only did nothing whatever reach them of all the fragments of general
knowledge which the learned beings of the club of the Adherents of
Legomonism had indicated in 'lawful inexactitudes' in the sacred law of
Heptaparaparshinokh or, as they called it, the 'Law of Sevenfoldness,' but in
the interval of time between these two civilizations, their being-rumination
has deteriorated so much that today they no longer know or even suspect the
existence on their planet of this universal law.
"And as regards the word 'art' which, thanks to their strange Reason, has
gotten 'tangled up' during this time with 'the devil knows what,' as they
themselves would say, I must tell you that my special investigations made it
clear to me that, among other words and expressions used by the learned
beings of Babylon which automatically passed from generation to generation,
this word 'art' happened to get into the vocabulary of certain three-brained
beings, in whose presence the consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer had crystallized in a sequence and with a 'reciprocal action' that
favored the arising of data in them for the being of 'hasnamuss individuals '
And as these beings, for some reason or other, happened to like this word,
they began using it for their egoistic aims, and gradually turned it into a
'something' which, though it still consists of 'utter futility,' has gradually been
enveloped in a fairylike exterior, which now blinds every one of your
favorites who keeps his attention on it a little longer than usual.
"Besides this word 'art,' quite a number of other words used in the
discussions of the learned members of the club of the Adherents of
Legomonism passed automatically from



generation to generation, as well as some 'foggy notions' about certain definite
conceptions of that time.
"Among these latter—as much for its name as for its caricature-like
imitation—is their contemporary notion of the 'theater. '
"You remember, I have told you that in Babylon both the hall and the demonstrations themselves of the learned beings belonging to the group of the mysterists were given the name 'theater. ' "If I now enter into somewhat more detail about this contemporary theater
of theirs, perhaps you will have enough material to understand how, in spite
of all the good intentions and efforts of those ancient learned beings, scarcely
anything of the true knowledge attained during the time of the Babylonian
culture has reached the beings of contemporary European culture to which
their art is largely indebted for that fairylike exterior I spoke of, and further
more, you will grasp certain aspects of the maleficence of that famous
contemporary 'art. '
"As I have told you, a certain amount of information about the activities of
the group of the mysterists reached the beings of the contemporary epoch
who, wishing to imitate them also in this, began building special halls for this
purpose, which they too called 'theaters. '
"The three-brained beings of contemporary civilization quite frequently
assemble in considerable numbers in these theaters of theirs to observe and
presumably to study the various prepared manifestations of their 'artists,' as
they have quite recently begun to call them, just as in Babylon the other
learned members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism studied the
demonstrations of the learned beings of the group of the mysterists.
"These theaters have acquired the greatest importance in the ordinary
process of existence of your favorites, and so



they erect particularly imposing buildings for this purpose which, in most of their contemporary cities, rank among the most noteworthy constructions.
"Here, I think, it will do no harm to comment upon the misunderstanding
connected with the word 'artist.'
"This word was also passed down to your contemporary favorites from the Babylonian epoch, not as all the others were, that is, as empty words without any sense, but just as a distant echo of a word formerly used. "You must know that at that time the learned members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism were given a name by the other learned beings, who were well disposed toward them, a name which they adopted for themselves, and which your contemporary favorites would write as 'Orpheist.' "This word was formed from distinct roots of words then in use, which in contemporary times would signify 'right' and 'essence.' If someone was called that, it meant that he 'rightly sensed the essence. ' "After the Babylonian period, this expression also passed automatically from generation to generation with almost the same meaning, but about two centuries ago, when certain beings with hasnamussian tendencies began wiseacring about that empty word 'art,' and when various 'schools of art' arose and everybody considered himself a follower of one or another of those schools, then, since they did not understand the genuine meaning of the word 'art,' and chiefly because one of these schools was named after a certain Orpheus, a figure invented by the ancient Greeks, they decided to coin a new word defining their 'vocation' more exactly. "So in place of the expression 'Orpheist' they invented the word 'artist,' which was supposed to mean 'he who is occupied with art.'



"In order that you may represent to yourself more clearly all the factors connected with this misunderstanding there, you must know first of all that before the second transapalnian catastrophe, when these favorites of yours still prepared themselves for responsible existence normally, as did all threebrained beings of our Great Universe, they had at their disposal for their 'speech'—that is, for mutual intercourse through appropriate sounds, intentionally uttered— and could pronounce up to 341 different consonances or 'letters. ' "But later on, when thanks as always to the same conditions of ordinary being-existence abnormally established by them, every property inherent in the presence of three-brained beings gradually deteriorated, this 'beingableness' also deteriorated and at such a rate that the beings of the Babylonian period could use for their conversation only seventy-seven definite sounds And thereafter the deterioration continued so rapidly that five centuries later your favorites could pronounce at most only thirty-six different 'letters,' and the beings of certain communities could not articulate even this small number of separate sounds. "And so, my boy, information concerning the Babylonian period passed from one generation to another not only through what is called 'oral transmission,' but also by means of markings on certain durable materials, that is, 'inscriptions' consisting of conventional signs or letters, which stood for different 'articulated being-sounds' of that time When, at the beginning of the contemporary civilization, certain beings began to decipher these inscriptions, 'a bit here and a bit there,' and realized that they could not pronounce many of these 'letters,' they invented what is called a 'written compromise.' "This 'written compromise' was that, in place of any sign or letter which they could not pronounce, even though they sensed the 'flavor' of its pronunciation, they decided to use



a somewhat similar letter contained in their alphabet at the time, and so that
everybody should understand that it was not that letter but quite another, they
always wrote beside it a letter of the ancient Romans, still existing, but
already meaningless, called in English 'h' and by the contemporary French
'ahsh.'
"From then on, all the rest of your favorites followed suit, namely, to each
of these 'suspicious' letters they added this Roman 'inheritance. '
"When this 'written compromise' was invented, there were about twenty
five of these 'suspicious' letters, but in the course of time, as their ability to
pronounce deteriorated along with the increase of their wiseacring, the
number of combined letters specially fabricated for such a 'being-faculty'
diminished, and by the time the word !artist' was invented only eight of these
combinations remained, and in front of this notorious 'h' they wrote letters,
partly ancient Greek and partly Latin, which produced the following 'th,' 'ph,'
'gh,' 'ch,' 'sch,' 'kh,' 'dh,' and 'oh. '
"The basis for the misunderstanding I mentioned was the compromising
sign 'ph. '
"And this was so because this sign appeared both in the word by which the
learned mysterists were designated and in the word which stood for a
personality invented by the ancient Greeks, with whose name, as I have
already said, one of their 'schools of art' had been connected, the result was
that the representatives of terrestrial art I spoke of, with their quite bob-tailed
Reason, then thought that this word merely indicated the followers of the
'historical personality' Orpheus, and since many of them did not consider
themselves his followers, they invented the word 'artist' in its place.
"As you see, not every legacy of the ancient Romans turned out to be
maleficent, since in the present case their little letter 'h' even became an
inspiring factor for



engendering in the presence of beings of subsequent generations—already without any initiative or ability of their own— the 'being-power' to substitute for the long-established expression 'Orpheist' this new word 'artist. ' "Here I must tell you about something very strange concerning the gradual
atrophy in the presence of all the terrestrial three-brained beings there of this
'being-ableness' to reproduce the sounds required for verbal intercourse.
"The point is that the deterioration of this capacity does not proceed at the
same rate in the psychic and organic functioning of the planetary bodies of all
the beings in every generation, but it alternates, as it were, at different times
and on different parts of the surface of this planet, affecting at one time more
the psychic and at another time more the organic part of the functioning of
their planetary body.
"A very good illustration of what I have just said is afforded by the
sensation of the 'taste' and the capacity to pronounce two different sounds or
letters known and used there by almost all the contemporary beings breeding
on all parts of the surface of your planet, and passed down to them by the
ancient Greeks from times long past.
"These two letters were called by the ancient Greeks 'theta' and 'delta '
"Here it is interesting to note that your favorites of very ancient times used
these two letters in the formation of words having two quite opposite
meanings.
"To be precise, they used the letter 'theta' in words expressing ideas
relating to the idea of 'good' and the letter 'delta' in words relating to the idea
of 'evil', as for example 'theos,' meaning 'god,' and 'daimonion,' meaning
'demon.'
"The meaning of these two letters, as well as the 'taste' of their consonance,
passed to all the beings of contemporary civilization, but for some reason or
other they indicated these two different letters, having entirely opposite
essences, by means of one and the same sign, namely, the sign 'th. '



"The beings of a large contemporary community called 'Russia,' however hard they try, cannot pronounce these two letters at all, yet they are clearly aware of their difference; and whenever they have to use them in words expressing a definite idea, even though the sounds they make do not correspond to these letters in the least, they sense the difference between them correctly and never use one letter for the other. "On the other hand, the beings of the contemporary community called 'England' still pronounce both these letters in almost the same way as the ancient Greeks; but they sense no difference in them, and for words of entirely opposite meanings, they employ, without the least embarrassment, one and the same conventional sign, in the form of their famous 'th.' "For instance, when beings of that contemporary England utter their favorite and frequently used expression 'thank you,' you can clearly hear the ancient letter 'theta'; and when they pronounce the no less common word 'there,' you hear quite definitely and distinctly the ancient letter 'delta', but for both these letters, they make use, without any 'remorse,' of the same panparadoxical 'th. '
"Well, I think that's enough about terrestrial philology. "We had better continue to examine why it is customary among your
contemporary favorites to have theaters everywhere, and what their
contemporary actors do in these theaters, and how they manifest themselves
there.
"Their custom of assembling in theaters, often in large groups, arose in my opinion because these theaters and all that goes on in them happen to correspond very well to the abnormally formed common presence of most of your favorites, who have entirely lost the need proper to three-brained beings to actualize their own initiative in everything, and who exist solely in accordance with accidental shocks



from outside or the promptings of the consequences crystallized in them of one or another of the properties of the organ kundabuffer. "Ever since those theaters of theirs came into existence, your favorites have
assembled in them, not for the purpose of watching and studying the
representations of their 'contemporary actors,' no they assemble merely to
satisfy one of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer,
very readily crystallized in the common presences of most of them, called
'oornel,' which they call 'showing off.'
"Thanks to this consequence of the properties of the organ kundabuffer,
most of the contemporary beings acquire in their presence a very strange need
to evoke in others the expression of the being-impulse called 'astonishment' in
regard to themselves, or even to catch a trace of it on the faces of those around
them.
"The strangeness of this need of theirs lies in the fact that they get
satisfaction from the manifestation of astonishment on the part of others in
regard to their external appearance, which they arrange to conform exactly
with the demands of what is called 'fashion,' that maleficent custom that has
existed ever since the Tikliamishian civilization and is now one of those
being-factors which automatically leave them neither the time nor the
possibility to see or sense reality.
"This custom, so maleficent for them, consists in periodically changing the
external form of what is called the 'covering of their nullity.'
"Here, by the way, I would remark that it has gradually become the rule, in
the general process of the ordinary existence of these three-brained beings
who have taken your fancy, for these changes in the external form of this
covering to be determined by the sort of beings of both sexes who have
already become 'worthy' to be candidates for hasnamuss individuals.



"In this respect, contemporary theaters turned out to be admirably suited to
your favorites, because it is very convenient and easy for them to show off, as
they like to say, their 'chic coiffures' or the 'specially tied knots of their cra
vats,' or the daringly bared what are called 'koopaitarian' parts of their bodies,
and so on and so forth, and at the same time stare at the 'latest fashions'
brought out according to the edicts of those famous candidates for hasnamuss
individuals.
"To get a clear picture of what the 'contemporary artists' do in these theaters
during all this 'showing off,' you must first be told about an exceedingly
strange 'illness,' known there under the name of 'dramatizacring,' the
predisposition to which arises in the presence of certain of your favorites
thanks simply to the carelessness of what are called their 'midwives.'
"The criminal carelessness on the part of the midwife in most instances
consists of this before doing her job, she calls on the way at the houses of her
other clients and drinks rather more 'wine' than is good for her, so that while
fulfilling her obligations she unconsciously mutters certain words fixed in the
process of the ordinary existence of your favorites like the 'incantations' of
what are called 'magicians', and the unfortunate new being, at the very
moment of its appearance, as they say, 'in God's world,' first imbibes the
words of this 'maleficent incantation,' formulated as follows 'Ekh, you, what a
mess you've made!'
"And so, my boy, thanks to this criminal carelessness on the part of the
midwife, the unfortunate new being acquires in his presence that
predisposition to the strange 'illness' I mentioned.
"When one of these three-brained beings, who at his first breath has acquired this predisposition to 'dramatizacring,' reaches the age of a responsible being, if he should know



how to write even a little and has the wish to do so, he suddenly gets this strange illness, and begins wiseacring on paper or, as is said there, 'composing' various 'dramas. ' "The subjects of these works are usually some events or other which are supposed to have occurred in the past or might occur in the future, or simply events of 'contemporary unreality.' "In the common presence of the sick being, there also appear in the course of this peculiar malady seven very specific symptoms. "The first is that, when this strange illness arises and begins to function in the presence of a being, particular vibrations are spread around him which act on those near him, as they say, exactly like the 'smell of an old goat. ' "The second is that, as a result of the change in the inner functioning of such a being, the exterior form of his planetary body undergoes the following changes his nose is held aloft, his arms, as is said, 'akimbo', his speech is punctuated by a special little cough, and so on. "The third, that such a being is always terrified of certain perfectly harmless formations, natural or artificial, as for instance, a 'mouse,' a 'clenched fist,' the 'stage manager's wife,' a 'pimple on his own nose,' 'his own wife's left slipper,' and any number of other things. "The fourth symptom causes him to lose entirely all capacity for understanding the psyche of beings like himself "The fifth consists in this, that inwardly and in his outer manifestations he
criticizes everybody and everything that does not come from himself.
"As for the sixth, the data necessary for the perception of anything objective are more atrophied in him than in all other terrestrial three-brained beings. "And the seventh and last symptom is that there arise in him what are called 'hemorrhoids,' which are, by the way, the only thing he carries with modesty.



"Further, it usually happens that if the sick being has an uncle who is a member of one or another of their parliaments, or has struck up an acquaintance with the widow of a former 'businessman' or, if for some reason the period of his preparation for becoming a responsible being has been spent in an environment or in conditions where he has automatically acquired the property called 'slipping in without soap,' a 'producer'—or, as he is sometimes called, an 'angel'—takes his 'play' and orders 'artists' or 'actors' to 'reproduce' it exactly as it was wiseacred by this being who has fallen ill with the strange illness of 'dramatizacring.' "And these contemporary actors first reproduce this work among themselves, without spectators, and do this over and over again until it corresponds exactly to the indications of the sick being and the orders of the 'director', and finally, when all this proceeds without the participation of the consciousness and feelings of the actors, who are completely transformed into 'living automatons,' then with the help of those who have not yet become complete automatons—for which reason they acquire the name of 'stage managers'— they go through the same procedure, but now in the presence of other ordinary beings assembled in these contemporary theaters of theirs.
"Thus from all I have just said, you can easily conclude that these theaters,
apart from many definitely maleficent consequences, which I shall soon
describe in detail, cannot of course contribute anything toward that lofty aim
of the Babylonian learned beings when they created for the first time that form
of conscious representation of perceptions and of the associative reactions to
them of other beings like themselves.
"All the same, it must be admitted that these theaters and contemporary actors, of course accidentally, did provide for



the process of their ordinary being-existence one 'not-so-bad' result.
"To understand what this 'not-so-bad' result consists of, I must first explain
another particularity that has become proper to the common presence of
beings who arise according to the principle of 'itoklanotz. '
"According to this principle, the elaboration in the presence of these
beings of the energy necessary for what is called their 'waking state' depends
on the quality of the associations proceeding in them during their complete
passivity or, as your favorites say, during 'sleep', and vice versa, the energy
needed to make this sleep 'productive' is elaborated from the associative
process going on in them during the 'waking state,' which in its turn is
dependent on the quality or intensity of their activity.
"And this was the case for those terrestrial three-brained beings ever since
Great Nature was compelled, as I have already told you, to replace the
'fulasnitamnian' principle which until then had been proper to their presence
with the principle of 'itoklanotz.' Thereupon there was acquired and still
remains in the process of their existence the particularity that if, as they say,
they 'sleep well,' they will 'be awake well' and, vice versa, if their 'waking
state' is bad they will also 'sleep badly. '
"And so, my boy, since in recent times they have been existing very
abnormally, the established automatic tempo that previously had more or less
helped the appropriate associations to proceed in them has also undergone a
change, so that now they sleep badly and when awake are even worse off than
before.
"And the reason why these contemporary theaters with their actors have
come to be useful for improving the quality of their sleep is to be found in the
following circumstances.
"After the need to actualize being-partkdolgduty had entirely



disappeared from the presence of most of them, and all the associations
of unavoidably perceived shocks began to flow during their waking state only
from various 'already automatized series of former imprints' made up of
'impressions experienced long ago' and endlessly repeated, there disappeared
in them even the instinctive need to receive all sorts of new shocks—vital for
three-brained beings—which issue either from their inner, separately
spiritualized being-parts or from corresponding perceptions coming from
without for conscious associations, namely, for those being-associations upon
which depends the intensity of transformation of every kind of 'being-energy'
in the presence of beings.
"In the last three centuries the very process of their existence has become
such that in the presence of most of them there have almost ceased to arise
during their daily existence any of those 'being-confrontative associations'
which usually proceed in three-brained beings as a result of every kind of new
perception, and from which alone data can crystallize in them for their own
individuality.
"Well then, when your favorites, leading their daily lives in this manner, go
to these present-day theaters and watch the senseless manipulations of the
actors, and receive shocks one after another from reminiscences of previously
perceived images, no less senseless and absurd, there willy-nilly appear in
them during this waking state of theirs more or less tolerable being
associations, so that when they get home and go to bed they sleep much better
than usual.
"But although these contemporary theaters with all that goes on in them
happen to be an excellent means for helping your favorites to sleep better—of
course only for today— the objectively evil consequences they entail for
beings, particularly for the rising generation, are incalculable.
"The greatest harm done by these theaters is that they serve as an additional factor for the complete destruction in



three-brained beings of all possibilities of ever feeling a need proper to them called the 'need for real perceptions. "And they have become such a maleficent factor chiefly because of the
following:
"When they go to their theaters and, sitting quietly, watch the varied yet
senseless manipulations and manifestations of contemporary actors, although
they are in their usual waking state, all their associations, whether 'mental' or
'emotional,' proceed in them exactly as they do during their complete passivity
or sleep.
"That is to say, when they receive a large number of accidental shocks,
which stimulate other shocks ensuing from perceptions previously fixed and
automatized in a series of impressions, and when there is projected onto them
the functioning of the 'organs of digestion and sex,' all this hinders the flow of
those conscious being-associations which, pitiable as they are, have somehow
become automatized to produce in them a more or less correct tempo for the
transformation of the substances required for their passive existence, during
which the substances required for their active existence must be transformed.
"In other words, during the time they spend in these theaters, they are not
entirely in that passive state in which the transformation of substances
required for their usual waking state has become more or less automatized
And so these contemporary theaters of theirs have become merely an
additional maleficent factor for the destruction of the 'need for real perceptions.'
"Among many other aspects of the maleficence of their contemporary art,
the radiations of the contemporary 'representatives of art' themselves are one
of the most obviously ignored but most harmful for all the three-brained
beings there, as regards the possibility of acquiring conscious 'individual
being.'
"Although these maleficent radiations have gradually become



the lot, or the specific attribute, of the representatives of all branches of
their art, my detailed 'physico-chemical investigations' definitely showed me
that they are always most pernicious in those contemporary artists or actors
who perform in these theaters of theirs.
"The noxious effect on all the rest of your favorites of the totality of the
radiations given off by these actors has become distinctly noticeable in their
present civilization, particularly during recent times.
"Although in previous epochs certain of the ordinary beings there also took
up that profession, on the one hand, data for 'hasnamussian properties' did not
always become completely crystallized in the presence of every one of them,
and on the other hand, the other beings instinctively sensed the maleficent
influence radiating from these professionals and hence were on their guard
and took great care to behave toward them in a corresponding manner.
"Indeed, in former centuries these artists or actors were relegated by other
beings everywhere to the lowest caste and were regarded with contempt And
even at the present time in many communities, for instance on the continent
of Asia, it is not acceptable to shake hands with them, as is almost always the
custom when meeting beings like oneself.
"In these communities, it is still considered defiling to sit at the same table
with these actors and to eat with them.
"But on the continent that is now the chief place of what is called their
'cultured existence,' contemporary beings not only inwardly consider these
actors to be on the same level as themselves, but even copy their outer
appearance, and at the present time imitate them in everything.
"A good example of what I have just said is the custom, now followed by
your favorites, of shaving the beard and moustache.



"You should know that in past epochs these terrestrial professional actors
always had to go about during the process of their ordinary existence with
moustaches and beards shaved off.
"And they had to shave off these 'expressers' of their masculinity and
activity, first of all because, constantly playing the roles of other beings, they
often had to change their appearance, putting suitable 'makeup' on their faces
and wearing wigs and false moustaches and beards, which they could not
possibly have done with their own beards and moustaches, and second,
because the ordinary beings of all the former communities there, considering
such actors dirty and a harmful influence and fearing that they might not
recognize them if they chanced to meet them in ordinary conditions of
existence and might inadvertently touch them, promulgated everywhere a
strict ordinance requiring professional actors always to shave off their
moustaches and beards in order to be unmistakable for other beings.
"While explaining to you the origin of this custom among actors of
shaving their moustaches and beards, I recalled a very sensible 'measure of
justice' employed by the three-brained beings of the epoch of the
Tikliamishian civilization also connected with the shaving of hair, but in this
case with the hair growing on the heads of beings.
"A law was then established and strictly enforced which decreed that those
petty criminals who, after trial by seven elderly beings of the given district,
had been found guilty of some 'immorality' or 'crime' belonging to one of four
previously established categories—the sort of criminals with whom all their
'prisons' are usually crammed today—had always to go about everywhere for
a definite term with one of four sides of their heads shaven, and furthermore,
any such convicted being was obliged to uncover his head whenever he met
or spoke with others.



"It is interesting to note that there then existed another law, comparable to the one about shaving the head, in regard to the immoral behavior of women. "In regard to the women, a decree existed that was also very strictly
enforced, subject in this instance to the jurisdiction of seven elderly local
women who had earned respect by their previous conduct And the penalties
for women applied to four manifestations that were then considered as the
greatest laxity and immorality.
"For instance, if all the neighbors noticed that some woman had behaved negligently and without due regard to her family duties, and if the seven elderly women confirmed it, then, according to this law, for a definite term wherever she went she had to appear with painted lips. "And if various women noticed that she had begun to manifest a
weakening of her maternal instinct toward her children, she was condemned
according to this law to go about everywhere, also for a definite term, with the
left half other face made up and painted white and red.
"And if, following the same procedure, it was established that a woman
manifested an inclination to avert the possibility of conceiving a new being for
the prolongation of her species, she was condemned to appear before others
with her face made up and also painted white and red, but this time only on
the right halt.
"And as for a woman who attempted to violate her 'chief wifely duty,' that
is, who deceived or even had the intention of deceiving her legal husband or
who attempted to destroy a new being conceived in her, she was obliged by
the same procedure, and also for a definite term, to go about everywhere made
up and painted white and red, this time over the whole of her face. "
At this point in his tale, Beelzebub was interrupted by Ahoon with the following words:



"Your Right Reverence All your explanations concerning terrestrial art
and those three-brained beings who are, so to say, its representatives, and
particularly your elucidations about the contemporary 'comedians' or actors,
have prompted me to make use of the impressions fixed in my common
presence and perceived during my last stay on the surface of the planet Earth,
in order to give our dear Hassein some good and practical advice. "
Having said this, Ahoon was about to look expectantly at the face of
Beelzebub with his usual unblinking gaze, but noticing the familiar smile,
always sorrowful yet kind and indulgent, he turned in some confusion toward
Hassein and, without waiting for permission, spoke as follows:
"Who knows? Maybe, dear Hassein, you too will one day visit that planet
Earth and have to exist among those peculiar three-brained beings who have
taken your fancy. "
And then, still keeping to the style and intonation of Beelzebub himself, he
went on:
"It is for this very reason that I now wish to initiate you into the results of
certain impressions I involuntarily received of the various types of those
contemporary representatives of art, as well as the peculiarities of their
manifestations.
"You must know that the three-brained beings of contemporary
civilization not only adorn this present-day art with a false halo and,
particularly during the last few decades, treat its so-called 'adepts' as equals
and imitate them in their exterior manifestations but also, always and
everywhere, unduly encourage and exalt them And in these contemporary
representatives of art themselves, who as regards their genuine essence are
really almost nonentities, there appears of itself, without any being
consciousness on their part, a false assurance that they are not like all the rest
but, as they call themselves, 'beings of a higher order', and the result is that in
the common presence of these types the crystallization of the consequences of
the properties of



the organ kundabuffer proceeds more intensively than in the presence of all
the other three-brained beings there.
"Furthermore, in regard to these unfortunate three-brained beings, the
surrounding abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence are already
established in such a way that there are bound to be crystallized in their
common presence and to become an inseparable part of their general psyche
those consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer they now call
'swaggering,' 'pride,' 'self-love,' 'vanity,' 'self-conceit,' 'self-infatuation,' 'envy,'
'hate,' 'touchiness,' and so on and so forth.
"These enumerated consequences are particularly conspicuous and most
rigidly crystallized in those representatives of art who are 'manipulators' in
the contemporary theaters, and this is because these 'manipulators,' who are
always interpreting the roles of certain of their fellow men with a being and
significance far superior to their own, and who in themselves, as I have
already said, are almost nonentities, gradually acquire, with their wholly
automatized Reason, a false view of themselves.
"Thus, with their quite automatized 'consciousness' and completely
nonsensical emotions, they feel themselves to be immeasurably superior to
what they really are.
"I must confess, dear Hassein, that during our earlier visits to the surface
of that planet of yours and also at the beginning of our last sojourn there,
although I was in many places and had various relations with those three
brained beings who have taken your fancy, I scarcely ever felt in my common
presence a genuine impulse of being-pity for the infinitely unhappy fate of
these favorites of yours, caused by circumstances hardly depending on
themselves at all.
"But toward the end of our sixth visit there, when certain of them were
formed with the kind of inner presence now possessed by the representatives
of almost all branches of that art of theirs, and when these newly arisen
'types,' taking



part in the process of ordinary being-existence on an equal basis with others, happened to come into the field of perception of my sight with their exaggeratedly abnormal 'inner appreciation of themselves,' they served as a shock for the arising in me of the impulse of pity, not only for them themselves but for all your unfortunate favorites. "Now try to turn your attention, not to all three-brained beings in general, nor to the other representatives of their contemporary art, but only to those who have become and have acquired the title of 'artists' or 'actors.' "Although every one of them in his genuine essence is almost what is called a 'nonentity,' that is, something utterly empty but enveloped in a certain visibility, they have gradually acquired such an opinion of themselves, by dint of repeating always and everywhere their favorite exclamations such as, 'What genius!' 'What talent'' 'What a gift'' and any number of other expressions as empty as themselves, that it is as if, among similar beings around them, only they are of 'divine origin'—only they are !almost gods. ' "Now listen and try to transubstantiate in the corresponding parts of your common presence, for use at the proper time, my really very practical advice. "This practical advice is that if for some reason you should have to exist, particularly in the near future, among the three-brained beings of that planet Earth which has taken your fancy—and I say in the 'near' future, because the presence of these favorites of yours as well as all the external conditions of their ordinary being-existence frequently degenerate—and if you should engage, as is proper to every conscious three-brained being, in some enterprise or other having as its aim the welfare of beings around you, and whose fulfillment depends partly on them themselves, then in whatever community of contemporary civilization you may be and whatever 'circles' you may frequent in the interests of your work, if you should ever meet any of these



terrestrial 'types,' be very, very careful and take all necessary measures to keep on good terms with them. "To see why you must be so careful with these recently arisen types, and in order that you may understand them better from every aspect, I must not fail to mention two other facts that have become quite clear. "The first is that, owing as always to the conditions of ordinary beingexistence abnormally established there, and also to the 'fictitiously inflated,' maleficent idea of their famous art, these 'representatives of art,' in the preconceived picturings and notions of the other three-brained beings, gradually become crowned with an imaginary halo, and thereby automatically acquire such authority that any opinion they express is considered beyond dispute. "And the second fact is that during their formation these recently arisen types acquire an inner presence that permits them, quite unconsciously on their part, just as easily to become somebody's slave as through accidental outer conditions to become his worst enemy. "That is why I advise you to be very much on guard not to make enemies among them, so as not to stir up a lot of trouble for yourself in carrying out your affairs. "Well then, our dear Hassein, the very 'tzimmes' of my advice to you is that if indeed you should have to exist among the beings of the planet Earth and have dealings with these representatives of contemporary art, never tell the truth to their face.
"May you be preserved from such a fate! "Any truth makes these terrestrial types extremely indignant, and their animosity toward others almost always begins from this indignation You must only say to their face the sort of things that 'tickle' those consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, infallibly crystallized in them, which I have already enumerated, namely, 'envy,' 'pride,' 'self-love,' 'vanity,' 'lying,' and so on.



"And, as I noticed during my stay there, the means of tickling which never fail to act on the psyche of these unfortunate favorites of yours are the following: "Suppose that one of these representatives of art has a face like a crocodile, be sure to tell him that he is the living picture of a bird of paradise. "If one of them is as stupid as a cork, say that he has the mind of Pythagoras. "If he has behaved in a certain matter like a 'super-idiot,' tell him that even that cunning fellow Lucifer could not have handled it better. "Suppose that from his appearance you see signs that he has several terrestrial diseases from which he is rotting day by day, then, with an expression of astonishment on your face, ask him: " 'Do, tell me please, what is your secret for always looking so fresh, like "peaches and cream," ' and so on. Only remember one thing . . . never tell the truth. "Although you have to behave like this toward all the beings of that planet, it is indispensable toward the representatives of all the branches of contemporary art.
Having finished speaking, Ahoon, smirking like a suburban matchmaker at the wedding of a client, or the proprietress of a Paris fashion house seated in an 'ultra-chic café,' began rearranging the curls of his tail. Hassein looked at him with his usual smile full of sincere gratitude and said:
"Many thanks to you, dear Ahoon, both for your advice and for your
clarification of certain details of the strange psyche of the three-brained beings
on that thoroughly ill-treated planet of our Great Universe.
And then turning to Beelzebub he addressed him in the following words
"Please, kind Grandfather, tell me. Is it really possible that



all the intentions and efforts of those Babylonian learned beings have come to
nothing, and that of all those fragments of knowledge then known on the
Earth, nothing whatever has reached the contemporary three-brained beings?'
To this question of his grandson, Beelzebub replied: "Indeed, my boy, to the great sorrow of everything existing in the
Universe, scarcely anything has survived from the results of their labors, and
hence nothing has been inherited by your contemporary favorites.
"The information they indicated in the manner I described passed from
generation to generation for only a few of their centuries. Soon after the epoch
of the 'magnificence of Babylon,' thanks again to their chief particularity,
namely, the 'periodic process of reciprocal destruction,' not only did there
almost entirely disappear the legomonism containing the keys to the lawful
inexactitudes in the Law of Sevenfoldness that were introduced into each of
the branches of the 'being-afalkalnas and soldjinokhas' but, as I have already
told you, there was also gradually lost even the very idea of this universal law
of the holy Heptaparaparshinokh, known in Babylon as the 'Law of
Sevenfoldness.'
"Every kind of conscious production of the beings of the Babylonian
period was gradually destroyed, partly by decay in the course of time and
partly during processes of reciprocal destruction, whenever this psychosis of
theirs reached the stage called the 'destruction of everything within the sphere
of visual perception. '
"These were the two chief reasons why almost all the consciously
actualized results of the learned beings of the Babylonian epoch disappeared
from the surface of that ill-fated planet, and at such a rate that after three of
their centuries there was almost nothing left of them.
"It must also be noted that the second reason I mentioned led to the gradual
decline and the almost total disappearance



of that new form established in the Babylonian era for the transmission of information and various fragments of knowledge to later generations through the beings they called 'initiates of art.' "I know a good deal about the disappearance of that custom of certain beings becoming 'initiates of art,' because just before I left that planet forever I had to elucidate this very thoroughly for another aim of mine. "For this purpose I specially prepared a very good 'tikloonia' chosen from among the beings of the female sex there, and made these clarifications through her. " 'Tikloonias' were formerly known on that planet as 'pythonesses,' but the contemporary ones are called 'mediums.' "So then, I found out that in the most recent times only four of these beings, 'initiates of art,' still remain there, through whom the keys to the understanding of ancient art still continue to be transmitted by means of a 'direct line of inheritance,' and that this transmission now proceeds under very complex and arcane conditions. "Of these four initiated beings still living today, one comes from among the beings called 'Redskins' dwelling on the continent of 'America', another, from among those inhabiting what are called the 'Philippine Islands', the third, from among the beings of the continent of Asia, in the region known as the 'source of the Pianje River', and the fourth and last, from among those who are called 'Eskimos.'
"Now listen carefully to why I used the expression 'almost' when I said that three of their centuries after the Babylonian period every kind of conscious and automatic reproduction of the 'being-afalkalnas and soldjinokhas' had almost entirely ceased to exist. "The point is that two of the branches of knowledge connected with the conscious productions of the beings of the



Babylonian period chanced upon favorable conditions and certain of their
elements passed from generation to generation, partly consciously through the
beings transmitting them, and partly automatically.
"One of these two branches recently ceased to exist, but the other has even
reached certain beings of contemporary times almost unchanged.
"This branch that reached beings of contemporary times is called 'sacred
dances.
"Thanks exclusively to the survival of these sacred dances from
Babylonian times, a very limited number of three-brained beings now have
the possibility, by means of certain conscious labors, to decipher them and
learn the information hidden there which is useful for their own being.
"And the of her branch I mentioned, which recently ceased to exist, was
the branch of knowledge of the Babylonian learned beings devoted to the
'combination of different tonalities of color,' which contemporary beings call
'painting.'
"The transmission of this branch of knowledge from generation to
generation proceeded almost everywhere and, although gradually coming to
an end with the flow of time, it continued until quite recently at a regular
tempo, both consciously and automatically, among the beings of a community
called 'Persia.'
"And it was only just before I left your planet for the last time, when the
influence of the so-called 'painters' of contemporary European culture began
to make itself felt also in Persia and the Persian beings of the same profession
began to wiseacre, that the transmission of this branch of knowledge entirely
ceased.
"It must be remarked that in spite of all this, quite a number of the works
of Babylonian times did reach the beings of contemporary civilization, chiefly
the beings breeding on the continent of Europe But these beings, with



out suspecting the 'well of wisdom' concealed in these works—which were not 'originals' but only partially decayed copies made by their recent ancestors, who were not yet complete 'plagiarists'—and without taking the appropriate practical measures to safeguard them, simply stuffed them into what are called 'museums ' And there, little by little these works have been either totally destroyed or partially mutilated by frequent copyings with various corrosive and oxidizing compositions such as 'alabaster,' 'fish glue,' and so on, only in order that the copyists might swagger before their friends or fool their teachers, or achieve some other hasnamussian aim. "It must in fairness be admitted that now and again certain beings of contemporary civilization have suspected that something was concealed in the works that chanced to reach them in their original form, specially created in Babylon by the members of the club of the Adherents of Legomonism, or even in the copies of these originals made in the course of their transmission from generation to generation by various conscientious professionals, to whom, as I have already said, it had not yet become proper to 'plagiarize,' and who therefore did not resort to altering the details of the works of others in order to pass them off as their own And it sometimes happened that certain of these inquiring beings of the European civilization, while searching very attentively, actually found in these works some fragment or other of this 'something' that had been intentionally hidden in them. "For instance, at the beginning of the contemporary European civilization,
a certain monk named Ignatius, who had formerly been an architect, attained
the possibility of deciphering the knowledge and useful information hidden in
the productions of almost all the branches of what was then called 'ancient
art,' which had come down from the Babylonian epoch.



"This monk Ignatius was about to share his 'discovery' with other monks
like himself, that is, with two of his so-called 'brethren'—with whom he, as a
specialist, had been sent by his abbot to direct the laying of the 'foundations of
a temple' that later became famous—when for some trifling reason ensuing
from the crystallized consequences of one of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer called 'envy,' he was murdered while asleep, and his planetary
body was thrown into the expanse of water surrounding the small island on
which it was proposed to erect that temple.
"This monk Ignatius arose and was formed as a responsible being on the
continent of Europe, but when he reached responsible age, in order to enrich
himself with information concerning the profession he had made the aim of
his existence, namely, that of 'architecture,' he left for the continent of Africa
And there he entered the brotherhood which existed on that continent under
the name of the 'Truth Seekers' And afterward, when this brotherhood
migrated to the continent of Europe, where it grew in numbers and its
members took the name of 'Benedictines,' he was already an 'all-rights
possessing brother' of this order.
"The temple I referred to exists there even until today and is called, it
seems, the abbey of 'Mont Saint-Michel. '
"On this continent of Europe several other inquiring beings also happened
to notice lawful inexactitudes in the works of various branches of art that had
reached them from ancient times, but no sooner did they find the key to the
understanding of these inexactitudes than their existence came to an end.
"Still another being from the continent of Europe noticed these
inexactitudes, and becoming more and more interested and laboring
perseveringly, he was able fully to decipher works of almost all the branches
of art.
"This wise terrestrial three-brained being was named Leonardo da Vinci.



"In concluding my present tale about contemporary terrestrial art, I might as well mention yet another of the many specific characteristics of those beings of contemporary civilization who devote themselves to this famous art. "This specific characteristic of theirs is that whenever one of these beings notices some 'lawful illogicality' in the productions that have come down from ancient times and begins to work in his branch of art in quite a new manner, perhaps in order to make this lawful illogicality clear to himself in practice, most of the beings around him occupied professionally in the same branch at once become his followers and begin doing supposedly the same thing, but of course without either aim or sense. "And it is owing to this 'specific' characteristic of the psyche of the representatives of contemporary art that, on the one hand, what are called 'new movements in art' are constantly springing up among your favorites, and on the other hand, those movements which were somehow rightly established by preceding generations, even though only after a fashion, are constantly dwindling. "Although this phenomenon exists among the representatives of all branches of contemporary art, for some reason or other the beings occupied in the branch they call 'painting' are most susceptible to it. "Hence it is that at the present time there exist among these professionals a great many 'new movements in painting' which have arisen in this way and have nothing in common. These new movements are known there by names such as 'cubism,' 'futurism,' 'synthesism,' 'imagism,' 'impressionism,' 'colorism,' 'formalism,' 'surrealism,' and many of her such names also ending in 'ism. ' At this place in Beelzebub's tale the hoofs of all the passengers of the
trans-space ship Karnak suddenly radiated 'something phosphorescent.'



This meant that the ship Karnak was nearing the place of her destination,
that is, the planet Revozvradendr. And already a stir and bustle began among
the passengers preparing to descend from the ship.
Beelzebub, Hassein, and Ahoon ended their conversation and also
hurriedly began to get themselves ready.
The phosphorescent gleaming of the hoofs came about because from the
engine room there were directed to that section of the ship, concentrated in
the required proportions, the holy parts of the sacred Omnipresent Okidanokh.



CHAPTER 31
The sixth and last sojourn of Beelzebub on
the planet Earth
WHEN, AFTER two "ornakras" or, as they say on the planet Earth, after two
"months," the cosmic intersystem ship Karnak left the atmosphere of the
planet Revozvradendr and began to fall back in the direction of the solar
system Pandetznokh toward the planet Karatas, Hassein sat down in his usual
place and turned to Beelzebub with the following words:
"Dear and beloved Grandfather . . . be kind as always and tell me something
more about the three-centered beings breeding on the planet Earth. "
In reply to this, Beelzebub related the story of his sixth and last sojourn on
the planet called "Earth."
He began thus: "I visited that planet for the sixth time just before I received my full
pardon, with permission to leave that very remote solar system situated
almost beyond reach of the direct emanations of the Most Holy Sun Absolute,
that is, just before my return here to the center of the Universe— to the place
of my arising—in the very bosom of our Common Uni-Being Endlessness.
"This time, as it turned out, I had to exist among these peculiar beings for
a fairly long period, namely, a little less than a year of our time or, by their
time calculation, more than three hundred years.
"This last visit of mine to the surface of that planet which has pleased you
was brought about by the following circumstances.
"You must know that after my fifth visit to that planet of yours I continued as before to observe from time to time



the existence of the three-brained beings there I observed them most
attentively during those periods when their chief particularity was taking place
among them, namely, during the 'processes of reciprocal destruction. '
"And I observed them so attentively at these periods because I wished to
clarify for myself, beyond all doubt, the causes of the periodic manifestations
of that utterly horrifying need of their strange, not to say phenomenal, psyche.
"So when I happened to be a little freer than usual, I would follow for
almost a whole Martian day or night all their different manifestations during
this process.
"And thanks to these special observations I made from the planet Mars, as
well as during my former personal sojourns among them, I acquired a fairly
exact knowledge of all the ways and means used by them for more effective
destruction of each other's existence.
"Well, my boy, once while I was watching this process of theirs from the
planet Mars through my big teskooano, I suddenly noticed something
absolutely new, which served as the initial cause impelling me to undertake
my sixth descent, that is, I saw that without moving from their places they did
something with a certain object out of which came a tiny puff of smoke,
whereupon a being from the opposite side immediately fell down either totally
destroyed or with one or another part of his planetary body mutilated or de
stroyed forever.
"This observation greatly astonished me, as I had never seen such a means
of reciprocal destruction before, and no data had as yet crystallized in my
presence for a confrontative logical explanation of their possible use of such a
means for destroying the existence of other beings like themselves My former
logical and psychological explanations could in no way be applied to this new
means for destroying each other's existence.



"Until then I had explained to myself that the beings of any given epoch did not acquire such an abnormal particularity of their psyche all by themselves, but that this horrible periodic being-need was acquired and gradually assimilated over the course of very many of their centuries, as always thanks to the abnormal conditions of existence established by the beings of earlier generations, and that this being-need, owing to external circumstances not depending upon them, had finally become inherent in the contemporary threebrained beings, and it was therefore inevitable for them to occupy themselves with this. "And indeed, my boy, at the start of these processes, they usually refrain instinctively from such unnatural behavior But later, when each of them finds himself in the midst of the process, and willy-nilly sees and becomes convinced that the destruction of the existence of beings like himself is accomplished so simply and that the number of those destroyed always grows and grows—then in spite of himself he begins instinctively to feel, and automatically to value, his own existence And seeing with his own eyes that at that very moment the possibility of losing his existence depends solely on the number of enemy beings not yet destroyed, and in consequence of the strengthened functioning in his imagination of the impulse called 'cowardice,' then because of the impossibility in such conditions of deliberating sanely with his already weakened being-mentation, and from a natural desire for selfpreservation, he begins to strive with all his being to destroy the existence of as many beings as possible on the enemy side, so as to have a greater chance of saving his own And as this feeling of self-preservation gradually becomes more intense, they all reach the state, as they themselves call it, of 'bestiality.' "But as regards that new means of destroying each other's existence which I then saw, it was impossible to apply this logical confrontation of mine for the simple reason that the



opposing sides were stationed fairly far apart, and that in these semi-favorable
conditions they quietly and cold-bloodedly, out of boredom as it were, did
'something or other' with a certain something, and thereby destroyed the
existence of other beings like themselves.
"And so this new means of theirs for the destruction of each other's
existence strengthened in my essence the need to clarify and to understand
beyond doubt all the genuine causes of this phenomenally strange psyche,
which had become proper solely to the presence of those peculiar three
brained beings.
"As I had nothing particular to do at this time on the planet Mars, I decided
to wind up my current affairs without delay and descend in person to your
planet, and there, on the spot, to elucidate at any cost this question that had
always troubled me, in order that once having solved it I would no longer
have to think about these phenomena of our Great Universe.
"Several Martian days later I flew there, as always, on the ship Occasion.
"This time we decided to descend on the continent of Asia near the country
named 'Afghanistan,' since before our flight we had clearly seen through our
teskooano that the latest process of reciprocal destruction was just then going
on in that country.
"Having descended onto a region near Afghanistan, we decided to send our
ship Occasion for mooring to some isolated place far from those regions
recently populated by your favorites.
"I must tell you that in recent times it has become anything but easy to find
a suitable mooring place for our ship on the surface of your planet, since your
favorites have built themselves many kinds of contrivances for 'marine
locomotion,' which they also call 'ships,' and these ships of theirs are



constantly flitting about in all directions, mostly around the continents. "We had, of course, the possibility of making our ship Occasion invisible to their organs of sight, but we could not annihilate its presence, and therefore it could not remain stationary on the water without the constant danger of their ships bumping into it. "Well, my boy, for this reason we decided this time to send our ship for mooring to what is called the 'North Pole,' where their ships had as yet no possibility of going.
"While we were descending to the surface of this planet of yours, the process of reciprocal destruction in Afghanistan came to an end, but all the same, I remained near this country, as at that period these processes of theirs took place most frequently on just that part of the continent of Asia. "Since, on this last personal flight of mine to the surface of your planet, I intended to attain without fail a complete awareness of the causes of the phenomenon that constantly troubled my essence—that is, of understanding all the reasons why the psyche of those three-brained beings who please you has become such an 'anomaly'—I did not return to the planet Mars as soon as on previous occasions but, as I have already told you, existed among your favorites for about three hundred of their years. "In giving you the information that throws light on the results of the data which were deposited for various reasons in the common presence of the three-brained beings of the planet Earth, my essence prompts me and animates my 'I' and all the separately spiritualized parts of my common presence to emphasize that during this last sojourn of mine on the surface of your planet I had to study very seriously, and to clarify by experiment, not only the details of the psyche of individuals taken singly but also the perceptions and



manifestations of the psyche of these beings in their mass reactions to each other under the influence of various combinations of surrounding conditions. "For these experiments of mine I was even obliged to have recourse to those branches of general knowledge which we call 'saonoltooriko,' 'gasometronoltooriko,' and 'sakookinoltooriko,' somewhat resembling what is found among your favorites under the names of 'medicine,' 'physiology,' and 'hypnotism.' "Soon after the beginning of my sixth sojourn I became categorically convinced, as a result of my experimental investigations, that most of the causes of the strangeness of their psyche lie, not in that usual consciousness in which they have automatized themselves to exist during what they call their 'waking state,' but in the consciousness which, thanks to their abnormal ordinary being-existence, was gradually driven back within their common presence and which, although it should have been their real consciousness, remains in them in its primitive state and is called by them the 'subconscious.' "This 'subconscious' is, moreover, just that part of their general psyche which, as you remember, was first observed by the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, who established that in it there are not yet atrophied the data for the fourth sacred impulse, named 'Objective Conscience.'
"Having chosen as the chief place of my existence the region in the center of
the continent of Asia called 'Turkestan,' I not only went from there to those
places where the processes that interested me were running their course but
during the lulls in these processes I also traveled a great deal, visiting almost
all the continents, where I encountered beings of many 'nationalities.'
"During these travels of mine I did not stay long anywhere except in certain independent countries on the continent of



Asia called 'China,' 'India,' 'Tibet,' and also of course in that half-Asiatic, halfEuropean community that has recently become the largest of all, named 'Russia. ' "In the beginning, whatever time I had free from observations and investigations concerning my chief aim I devoted to the study of 'languages,' in order to have greater possibilities of establishing suitable relations everywhere with beings of all 'types,' belonging to every 'nationality. ' "Maybe, my boy, you do not yet know about that phenomenal absurdity found only on this ill-fated planet, which consists in this for 'verbal intercourse,' again thanks to the abnormal external conditions of their ordinary existence, there are as many different 'languages' or 'dialects' having nothing in common with each other as there are distinct independent groups into which they have gradually become divided, whereas on all other planets of our Great Universe where three-brained beings breed, there is everywhere one common form of what is called 'sound-manifesting mutual intercourse.' "Yes . . . this 'multiplicity of languages' is another of the exclusive characteristics of these strange three-brained beings who please you. "Indeed, on every scrap of 'terra firma,' and even for each tiny independent group accidentally separated from the others on such a scrap, these strange beings have developed a quite different dialect, and still continue to do so. "So nowadays, because of this, if one of the inhabitants of some locality of
the planet Earth finds himself by chance in another place on the same planet,
he has no possibility whatever of communicating with his fellow beings there
unless he learns their language.
"Even I, who by then knew eighteen of their 'languages' to perfection, found myself at times during my travels in situations where I could not even get fodder for my horses, in spite of the fact that my pockets were full of what they



call 'money,' for which in general they will joyfully give you anything you wish. "It may happen that if one of these luckless beings, existing in some town
or other and knowing all the 'languages' used in that town, must for some
reason go to a place no farther away than sixty or so of their 'miles'—a
distance corresponding approximately to one of our 'klintranas'—then,
because of the abnormality I referred to, and also of course because the data
for instinctive perception were long ago atrophied in these unfortunates, this
ill-fated three-brained being, so near the place of his established existence,
becomes absolutely helpless and can neither ask for what he really needs nor
understand a word of what is said to him.
"Not only do these numerous 'languages' of theirs have nothing in
common, but some of them are so constructed that they do not correspond at
all with the possibilities of those organs in the common presence of beings
called 'vocal cords,' which are specially adapted by Nature for this purpose
Even I, who have a much greater possibility than these beings in this respect,
was entirely unable to pronounce certain words.
"The beings of the planet Earth, however, have themselves realized this
'absurdity' of theirs, and recently while I was still there, a number of
'representatives' of various 'substantial' communities met together somewhere
in order to find a way out of this difficulty.
"The chief purpose of these representatives of the important contemporary
communities was to select one of the existing 'languages' and make it the
common language for the whole planet.
"But as usual, nothing came of this really sensible intention of theirs,
owing of course to their inevitable dissensions, which always cause their
promising beginnings to fall through.
"In my opinion it will be useful if I tell you in a little more



detail why these dissensions occurred, as this is a very characteristic example
of all the 'dissensions' in general that arise among them.
"At the outset, these representatives of the substantial communities, why I
don't know, limited their choice of a common planetary language to one of
the following three !ancient Greek,' 'Latin,' and the language recently
invented by contemporary beings called 'Esperanto. '
"The first of the three languages was the language that was elaborated and
served for the 'verbal intercourse' of the beings of that ancient community
which arose, as I have already told you, from a small group of Asiatic
fishermen that later became a substantial community whose beings were, for
a long time, specialists in the 'invention of sciences.'
"From the beings of this community, that is, the ancient Greeks, not only
many different 'sciences' but also their 'language' reached contemporary
beings.
"The second language they proposed for common planetary use, namely
Latin, was the language spoken by the beings of that other substantial ancient
community which was formed, as I have also told you, from a small group of
Asiatic shepherds, whose descendants had been the cause of the gradual
formation in the presence of all the beings of subsequent generations of that
perverted function which ultimately became fixed and inherent in your
contemporary favorites—thanks to which all impulses arising in them, in the
sense of striving for evolution, are automatically paralyzed at their very
root—the function they call 'sexuality. '
"Well then, when these representatives of various powerful contemporary
communities met together in order to choose one of the three languages, they
could not settle upon any one of them owing to the following considerations:
"Latin they found poor in its number of words. "And indeed, my boy, the shepherds with their limited



needs could not create a very rich vocabulary, and although Latin later
became the language of a large community, apart from the special words
required for orgies, they did not introduce into it anything worthwhile for the
contemporary beings of your planet.
"As for Greek, though by virtue of the wealth of its vocabulary it could
very well have served as the universal language for their whole planet—since
these former fishermen, in inventing every possible kind of fantastic science,
also devised many corresponding words that remained in that language—these
representatives of the powerful communities could not fix their choice upon it
because of a characteristic also ensuing from this strange psyche of theirs.
"The point is that all the beings who were assembled to select a common
planetary language were representatives of communities which, at that period
of contemporary civilization, had become 'powerful' or, as they also say, 'great.'
"This ancient Greek language is still spoken by the beings of a small
community called 'Greece,' but today, although they are descendants of the
former, great Greeks, they do not have as many 'guns' and 'ships' at their
disposal as those 'important' communities whose representatives had come
together to make a unanimous choice of one common language for the whole
planet.
"Therefore, in all probability, those representatives who rejected this
language deliberated somewhat as follows:
" 'Good Heavens! How could the whole world use a language spoken by
the beings of such an insignificant community, which hasn't even enough guns
to entitle its representatives to equal participation in our "international five
o'clocks"?'
"Of course the contemporary beings who become representatives of
'important' communities know nothing of the true reasons why this or that
community of beings like



themselves, dwelling on one or another part of their planet, becomes at times temporarily 'important' or 'great. ' "They do not even begin to suspect that this is not because of any particular
qualities in the beings of these communities, but depends exclusively on the
part of the surface of their planet from which, for the purposes of the most
great universal trogoautoegocratic process, and in correlation with the
harmonious movement of the whole of their solar system, there are required at
the given period more of those vibrations arising either from their radiations
or from the process of the sacred rascooarno in them.
"And as for the third language that the assembled representatives
considered for the use of the whole planet, namely, the one they call
Esperanto, there did not even arise their usual squabbles, which they
characterize as 'foaming at the mouth,' since they themselves, even with their
bob-tailed Reason, immediately recognized that it could in no way serve their
purpose.
"The inventors of this Esperanto must have imagined that a language is like
one of their contemporary 'sciences,' which can be cooked up at home in one's
study, indeed, it never entered their heads that a practical language can take
form only in the course of many centuries and even then only during the
process of more or less normal being-existence.
"This new invention called 'Esperanto' might, however, be suitable for the
'hens' of our highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin to keep him supplied with
amusing anecdotes.
"In short, this promising undertaking of theirs, to establish one common
planetary language, changed nothing in their utter absurdity and everything is
still just as it was before, that is to say, this comparatively small planet, with
its paltry, 'half-dead terra firma,' remains, as our dear teacher Mullah Nasr
Eddin also says, 'a thousand-tongued hydra. '



"Well, my boy, at the very beginning of my last stay among them, when I
began my investigations in regard to the fundamental aim I had set myself this
time, that is, to become aware beyond all doubt of the causes that had
engendered such a peculiar psyche in the presence of the three-brained beings
of that planet, and when I had to make clear certain hidden details of this
psyche of theirs, there unexpectedly arose for me a very serious difficulty It
turned out that it was possible to bring to light these hidden properties which
are in their subconscious only with their own voluntary help, that is, with the
help of that consciousness which, with the flow of time, has become proper to
them during their waking state Furthermore, I realized that this voluntary help
would have to come from the three-brained beings of all the different types
that have begun to be formed there during recent years.
"But by this time, as it proved, all the data for the arising in their presence
of the being-impulse called 'sincerity' had already atrophied in them to such a
degree that they no longer had the least possibility, even if they wished, of
being sincere, not only with other beings but even with themselves, that is,
they could no longer, with one of their spiritualized parts, criticize and judge
another part of themselves impartially.
"Here it must be said that my subsequent special research revealed that the
atrophy of the data which should be in them for the possibility of being
sincere with themselves has one cause, whereas the atrophy of the possibility
of being sincere with others has another.
"The cause of the atrophy of the data for being sincere with themselves lies
in the disturbance of the coordination of their common psyche.
"The point is that, at the beginning of this sixth sojourn of mine among
your favorites, on the one hand data continued to be crystallized in their
common presence for the



arising in them, as in all three-brained beings, of the being-impulse called 'self-remorse,' which they call 'remorse of conscience,' while on the other hand all their inner and outer manifestations in the ordinary process of their beingexistence began to be progressively less and less becoming to three-brained beings. "Consequently, the causes for the manifestation of this being-impulse of 'remorse of conscience' arose more and more frequently in their presence And the sensations thus induced, which are similar to those ensuing from 'beingpartkdolgduty,' infallibly led to the suppression and enslavement of the 'denying principle' inherent in the common presence of three-brained beings, called 'self-calming' And then, during all the inner and outer manifestations of their common presence, which were set in motion by the natural stimuli of one or another of their independent spiritualized localizations, each time this disagreeable sensation of 'self-remorse' arose, they began—at first deliberately, on the initiative of their ruminating parts, and later by force of habit—to stifle and gradually stop all 'self-criticism.' "And the resulting 'impotence,' increasing more and more in their inner organization, has brought on by frequent repetition the whole disharmony of the functioning of their psyche, and has gradually caused the almost total disappearance from their common presence of the data necessarily inherent in every three-brained being of our Great Universe for manifesting sincerity even toward themselves. "As for the disappearance from their common presence of data for the 'ableness to be sincere' with other beings like themselves, this was caused by that abnormal form of their mutual relationships long before established there which, as I have already told you, was based on their division into different 'castes or classes.' "When this habit of assigning one another to these various maleficent castes had become inherent in them, there grad



ually crystallized in the common presence of each of them two peculiar, quite
opposite 'organic properties,' whose manifestations have ceased little by little
to depend on either their ordinary consciousness or their 'subconscious. '
"These two properties consist in their always behaving toward each other
either with 'haughtiness' or with 'servility.'
"While these properties are being manifested in them, any relationship 'on
equal terms' with anybody at all is paralyzed And thanks to this, their inner
sincere, as well as their outer habitual, relationships have become established
in such a way, particularly in recent times, that it is now quite usual, if
someone belongs to a caste considered higher than that of another, for
impulses called 'haughtiness,' 'contempt,' 'condescension,' and so on always
and in everything to arise in him toward the other And if someone considers
his own caste lower than that of another, there will unfailingly arise in him the
impulses they call 'self-abasement,' 'false humility,' 'obsequiousness,'
'cringing,' and many others of the same sort, all of which together constantly
corrodes in their presence what is called the 'awareness of one's own indi
viduality,' which ought to be present in them also.
"And so these properties, becoming inherent in their common presence,
gradually caused your favorites to lose the habit of being sincere with others
like themselves and finally to cease automatically to be capable of it, even
with those belonging to their own caste.
"For this reason, my boy, I decided this time, while existing among these
favorites of yours, to choose that profession which makes it possible, now and
then, automatically to establish relations in which they can be sincere up to a
certain degree, and I did this in order to have the opportunity of asking
questions indispensable to my research, and thus of collecting material for my
elucidations.



"That is why I then became one of those professionals known there at the present time as 'physicians.' "This profession corresponds more or less to that of our 'zirlikners.'
"Besides this profession, there is, by the way, yet another one with whose
representatives some of your favorites automatically become more sincere,
perhaps, than with the physicians, especially as regards their 'inner
experiencings,' as they call them, which I needed most of all for my
elucidations.
"However, although this profession might have yielded more material for
my investigations, I decided not to choose it for myself, for the sole reason
that this profession, to which those called 'confessors' most often devote
themselves, constantly constrains one to play a role outwardly and never
allows one to consider one's real inner impulses.
"Before going further, I must also explain a little about these
contemporary 'physicians' who ought to correspond to our 'zirlikners.'
"You are probably already well aware that our zirlikners on the planet
Karatas, as also the beings corresponding to them on the other planets of our
Great Universe inhabited by already formed three-brained beings, are those
responsible individuals who voluntarily take upon themselves essential
obligations in relation to the beings of their 'district,' and who devote the
whole of their existence to helping any one of them to fulfill his being
obligations if, on account of a temporary disorder in the functioning of his
planetary body, or for some other reason, he ceases to be able to fulfill his
inner or outer being-duty himself.
"It must be said that formerly, on your planet also, those professionals
now called 'physicians' were almost the same and did almost the same as our
zirlikners. But with the flow of time, the responsible beings there who
devoted them



selves to that profession, namely, to the fulfillment of this high being-duty
voluntarily taken upon themselves, gradually degenerated like everything else
on that strange planet, and became extremely peculiar.
"And nowadays, when the functioning of the planetary body of one of your
favorites becomes impaired in this or that respect, and he can no longer fulfill
his being-obligations, these contemporary 'physicians' are indeed called in to
help, and, no question about it, these physicians do sometimes come, but how
they help and how their essence is manifested in the discharge of their
obligations, precisely here, as our highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin says,
'the dead camel of the merchant Vermassan Zeroonan Alaram is buried.'
"You should know first of all that these contemporary professionals are for
the most part those who during the period of their preparation to be
responsible beings succeed in 'stuffing' themselves with quantities of
miscellaneous information concerning the means for getting rid of every
possible kind of what are called 'illnesses,' means which, on that planet, old
women in their dotage have always prescribed and used for this purpose.
"Among these means for getting rid of their illnesses are various remedies existing under the name of 'medicines. ' "And when one of the young beings becomes a responsible professional,
and other beings apply to him for help, he prescribes precisely these remedies.
"Here it will be very useful for the development of your Reason if a
'logicnestarian implantation' is added to your common presence, based on
information concerning one very peculiar property acquired in the psyche of
these contemporary professionals of the planet Earth.
"This peculiar psychic property is acquired by those terrestrial
professionals as soon as they receive the title of



qualified physician,' and it functions in them as long as their wish persists to help of her beings who need their aid. "The point is that, in the common presence of such a professional, both the intensity of the desire to help others and the very quality of the help always depend exclusively on the 'prevailing smell' in the house to which he is called "In other words, if the house to which he is called smells of what are known as 'English pounds,' not only does his inner 'being-wish' to help the sufferer increase to the point of what is called 'ne plus ultra,' but his planetary body at once assumes the form and outer manifestations of a 'dzedzatshoon,' that is, a 'beaten dog.' "From this smell there appears on the faces of most contemporary
physicians what is called a 'boot-licking' expression, and their bobtail becomes
pressed tight, almost glued between their legs.
"But if the house to which one of these terrestrial zirlikners is summoned to help an ailing being smells of 'devalued German marks,' his inner beingwish to help the sufferer also increases, but only to impel him to write out as quickly as possible what is called a 'prescription'—another German invention—and to hurry out of the house. "Here I must also tell you that when, in the second case, this contemporary terrestrial physician leaves the house of the person who needed his help and walks along the street, his whole exterior, even the muscles of his face, invariably express something like the following 'Look out, you scum, or I'll crush you like cockroaches Don't you see who's coming? Not just anybody, but a genuine representative of science who has assimilated all the knowledge offered today by the highest seats of learning!' "It will be most opportune to tell you now a little about those 'medicines' I mentioned, which exist there in great quantity under every kind of name and which, on the advice



of these contemporary physicians, the ordinary beings introduce into themselves, ostensibly to cure their various illnesses. "And this is something I must really tell you about, for who knows some day you too may have to exist on that peculiar planet among those queer folk, and you would not know how to deal with these innumerable medications, nor what importance to give them. "Above all, you should remember that every young three-brained being who is preparing himself to take up the profession of physician when he reaches responsible age merely learns by rote as many names as possible from the thousands of medications known there today. "And later, when he has become a responsible being practicing this profession with the official title of 'physician,' and is called to the bedside of a sick person, his entire help consists in making a being-effort of a certain intensity just to remember the names of some of these medicines and then to write them on a scrap of paper called a 'prescription,' in order to indicate the mixture to be introduced into the planetary body of what is called 'his patient ' The intensity of his effort, however, depends first of all on the 'social status' of the patient, and second, on the number of eyes fixed on him by the beings surrounding the sick being. "Well then, this prescription he has written is taken by the near relatives of
the sick being to one of their contemporary 'pharmacies,' as they are called,
where the 'pharmacist' prepares the required 'mixture. '
"As for the way such 'mixtures' are prepared in these pharmacies and exactly what goes into them . . . well, you will understand this if I give you just one of the many pieces of information I picked up about it from one of the beings there exercising this very profession of pharmacist.
"The tale I am about to relate refers to the period when



I had begun making frequent visits to that large community called 'Russia.'
"Well, in one of the two chief cities of this large community, namely, the
city called 'Moscow,' I happened to establish friendly relations with one of
these professional pharmacists.
"This pharmacist, according to the notions on that planet, was already an
elderly being, he was very kind by nature and even, so to say, obliging.
"He belonged to what is known as the 'Jewish faith.' "It should be added that on almost all the continents there at the present
time most of these pharmacists, why I don't know, are beings belonging to the
'Jewish faith.'
"And so, whenever I visited that second chief city of Russia, I would
always go to see that acquaintance of mine at his pharmacy, and in the back
room, generally dignified by the name of 'laboratory,' I used to chat with him
about this and that.
"One day when I went into his 'laboratory,' I saw that he was pounding
something in a mortar and, as is customary there in such a case, I asked him
what he was doing.
"He replied: " 'I am pounding burnt sugar for this prescription,' and he handed me a
scrap of paper bearing the usual 'prescription' for a widely used medicine
known there as 'Dover's powder.'
"This powder is called 'Dover's' because it was invented by a certain
Englishman whose name was Dover, and it is chiefly used for coughs.
"Glancing at the prescription he handed me, I saw that sugar was no part
of it, much less burnt sugar at which I expressed my surprise and perplexity.
"Thereupon, with a good-natured smile, he answered me, 'Of course there
is no sugar in this prescription, but it does call for a certain amount of opium.



"And he went on to explain as follows: 'This Dover's powder, for some reason, is a very popular remedy among
us in Russia, and is used by almost all the peoples of our immense empire.
'Hundreds of thousands of packets of this powder are used daily all over
the country and, as you know, the opium it ought to contain is no cheap thing,
if real opium were put into this powder, that alone would cost us pharmacists
six to eight kopecks a packet, and we have to sell it for three to five kopecks
Besides, even if one collected all the opium from the whole globe there would
not be enough for our Russia alone.
'And so, instead of Dr Dover's prescription, we pharmacists have
invented another formula making use of substances that are easily obtainable
and affordable for everybody.
'That is why we prepare this powder with soda, burnt sugar, and a small
quantity of quinine, all these substances are cheap well, it is true, quinine is a
bit expensive but after all, you see, not much of it is needed In the whole
composition of these powders, there is only about two percent of quinine. '
"Here I could not help interrupting him: 'You don't mean it! . . . Is it
possible that no one has ever discovered that instead of Dover's powder you
are giving them this "concoction"?'
'Of course not,' laughingly replied this good acquaintance of mine
'These things can be detected only by sight and taste, and the powder we
make, whichever way you turn it and whatever microscope you examine it
under, is just the color it ought to be according to the original formula of this
Dr Dover And as to taste, thanks chiefly to the proportion of quinine we put
into it, it is absolutely impossible to distinguish it from the genuine powder
made with real opium.



" 'But what about the analysis?' I asked him " 'What analysis?' he replied sarcastically, though still with a kind smile 'A thorough analysis of a single powder would cost so much that with this money you could not only buy half a hundredweight of this powder but possibly open a whole pharmacy, so it is understandable that for three or five kopecks nobody is likely to be such a fool. " 'Strictly speaking, the kind of analysis you have in mind is never done anywhere. 'Each town, of course, has its own "analytical chemists," and even every district has specialists of this kind in its service. 'But what do they amount to and what do they know, these "analytical chemists"? 'Perhaps you are not aware of how these specialists, who occupy such responsible posts, study and what they understand? No?
'Then let me tell you. 'Take for instance some "mama's darling," a young man, with the inevitable pimples on his face—and he has pimples because his "mama" considered herself "well brought up" and thought it "indecent" to point out certain things to her son, so that this son of hers, whose consciousness was not yet formed, did that which "was done" in him, and the results of these "doings," as with all such young people, appeared on his face as pimples, well known even to contemporary medicine. Well, my esteemed Doctor . . ,' the pharmacist went on. "However, my boy, before continuing further with what the kind
pharmacist said I must mention that when I became a professional physician,
wherever I went your favorites called me 'doctor. '
"Some other time I will tell you all about this title they use, because that word 'doctor' was once the cause of a very sad misunderstanding involving our dear Ahoon.



"But now listen to what that amiable pharmacist went on to tell me.
'This young man,' he said, 'this mama's darling with the pimpled face,
studies at some university to become a specialist in analytical chemistry, and
there he is required to study textbooks fabricated for the most part by "learned
beings" from Germany.
"And really, my boy, these contemporary pure-blooded successors of the
ancient Greeks have also developed the habit, especially during recent times,
of cooking up all kinds of 'scientific books' on all subjects.
"Since 'chemical analysis' is one branch of their science, these German
'scientific beings' have produced a mass of books in this field also, and almost
all the peoples of Europe, as well as of other continents, use these books.
'Well,' continued that kind pharmacist, 'this young man, having finished
his university course and consequently having drawn his knowledge of the so
called "composition of substances" from books fabricated by German "scien
tists," has to make the analysis of our Dover's powder.
'In these German books from which he gathered his knowledge of the
"nature of substances" it is of course stated which elements each substance is
composed of, and the formulas also are invariably quoted.
'These books also describe the appearance of the substances when all the
required elements are present, and how their appearance changes if these
elements are lacking Several homely methods for recognizing substances are
also included in these German books—for instance, by sight, by taste, by
burning, as well as by certain methods that our grandmothers had heard tell of
in the "good old days," and so on and so forth.
'So then, on finishing the course, this young man receives the title of
"analytical chemist."
" 'And it sometimes happens that before being assigned



to a responsible post he gets "practice," usually through serving for a while at
a slaughterhouse, where he helps the local chemist, a former mama's darling
like himself, to ascertain with the aid of a microscope, in a certain way known
solely to themselves, whether or not the pork contains trichinae, and only
later, when there is a vacancy somewhere, is he appointed to the official post
of "analytical chemist."
" 'Well, dear Doctor, such an official analytical chemist receives our
Dover's powder for analysis On receiving it he recognizes it as Dover's
powder, either by looking at it or by tasting it as ordinary "mortals" do, or
because the sender has definitely stated that it is Dover's powder.
" 'For this analysis he picks up from his table what is called the
"pharmaceutical guide," also composed by Germans, which every official
analytical chemist is bound to have, and in the guide he hunts up the place
where the formulas of all kinds of powders are listed.
" 'As Dover's powder is known everywhere, it is of course also included in
this book.
" 'Thereupon our highly respected analytical chemist takes from his table a
form with his official title on it and writes:
" ' "The powder submitted to us for analysis, according to all the tests,
proves to be 'Dover's powder ' Analysis shows it to contain " And he copies
a formula from his German "pharmaceutical guide," deliberately increasing or
decreasing some of the figures, but of course only very slightly so that it won't
hit you in the eye.
" 'And he does this in the first place so that everyone should know that he
has not written up the results of his analysis any old way but has really
investigated the matter, and second because, after all, as the "town chemist"
he is an official personage, and will hardly wish to make enemies in the place
where he lives.
" 'The completed form is dispatched to whoever sent the



Dover's powder, and the famous analytical chemist himself is quite tranquil,
since no one will know that he made no analysis at all, nor can anyone check
up on him, as he is the only official analytical chemist in the town, and even if
one of these powders of ours should be taken to some first-rate chemist in
another town there would be no cause for alarm . . . Was that the only Dover's
powder in the world? The packet he analyzed no longer exists, for naturally in
making the analysis he had to destroy it.
'Besides, you would never find anyone who for the sake of three
kopeck's worth of Dover's powder would kick up a fuss.
" 'In any case, esteemed Doctor, for thirty years now I have been making
these powders according to our "prescriptions" and, believe me, I sell them,
and so far I have never had any misunderstanding on account of these Dover's
powders of ours And there can be no misunderstanding because Dover's
powder is known everywhere and everybody is convinced that it is excellent
for coughs.
'All that is required of any remedy is that it should be known to be
effective.
'As for how the remedy is made and what goes into it . . . what does that
matter?
'Personally speaking, from handling these medications for many years I
have formed the definite opinion that none of the remedies known to
contemporary medicine can be of any use without faith in them.
'And faith in a remedy arises in a person only when the remedy is well
known and everybody says that it is very good for this or that illness.
'It's the same with this powder of ours, once it is called "Dover's
powder" that is enough, because everybody knows it and many people say that
there is nothing better for coughs.
'Besides, speaking candidly, our new compound is



much better than the real one made from the prescription of Dr Dover himself, if only because it contains no substance injurious to the organism " 'For instance, according to Dr Dover's formula, opium must enter into the
composition of his powder.
" 'And you know the properties of opium If a man takes it often enough,
even in small doses, his organism soon becomes addicted to it, so that if he
ever stops taking it he suffers intensely.
" 'But with the powder made from our formula this would never happen, since it contains neither opium nor any other substance harmful to the organism. 'In short, my esteemed Doctor, everyone walking in the streets ought to
shout from the bottom of his heart "Long live the new formula for Dover's
powder!"
"He was about to say something more, but just then a boy brought him
from the pharmacy a whole stack of prescriptions, whereupon he got up and
said to me:
'Excuse me, my dear Doctor, I am obliged to stop our friendly chat and
get busy on the preparation of these innumerable orders.
" 'By bad luck both of my assistants are absent today, one of them because
his esteemed better half is about to bring into God's world one more mouth to
feed, and the other because he must go to court for the trial of a chauffeur
accused of kidnapping his daughter. '
"Well, enough of that. "If you really should have to exist among these favorites of yours, at least you will know from this last story of mine that although the physicians there write dozens of wiseacring names on their prescriptions, their remedies are almost always prepared in these official establishments called 'pharmacies' in the manner of that Dover's powder.
"It even happens occasionally that early in the morning



those good pharmacists prepare a whole barrel of some liquid or other, and a
large box of some powder, and the rest of the day they fill every prescription
that comes in by drawing liquid from the common barrel or by taking powder
from the common box.
"In order that the mixtures prepared beforehand should not always look
exactly alike, these worthy professionals add something to vary the colors and
to change their taste and smell.
"In spite of all I have said, however, I advise you very strongly to be
extremely careful with one sort of remedy they have, because it does
sometimes happen that these kind pharmacists put something poisonous for
the planetary body into these mixtures—of course by mistake.
"Moreover, for beings with normal Reason the custom has been
established—of course accidentally—of depicting what is called a 'skull and
crossbones' on the labels of mixtures of this kind, so that they can always
distinguish these toxic remedies from ordinary medications.
"Be that as it may, remember that among many thousands of medications
known and prescribed by contemporary physicians, only three—and even
these only sometimes— produce certain real results for the planetary bodies of
your contemporary ordinary three-brained beings.
"One of these three medications that do sometimes produce a useful
reaction is that substance or, more strictly speaking, those active elements
composing it, which the beings of Maralpleicie learned how to extract from
poppy seeds, and which they were the first to call 'opium. '
"The second substance is that which is called there 'castor oil ' This
substance was already used long ago by the beings of Egypt for embalming
their mummies, and it was they who also noticed that this medication has,
among other things, that action for which it is employed today.
"The knowledge about this 'castor oil' had been passed



down to the beings of Egypt from those beings of the continent of Atlantis who belonged to the learned Society of Akhldanns. "And the third substance is the one that from the dawn of centuries has been extracted from what is called the 'cinchona tree. '
"And now, my boy, listen to the information I shall give you about the title of 'doctor,' recently invented to designate terrestrial physicians. "This too, it seems, is an invention of the beings of that important
community of Germany, and they thought up this appellation in order to
indicate some merit or other of certain of them, but this same invention was
soon spread over the whole planet and for some reason became the ordinary
form of address for all contemporary physicians there.
"It must even be emphasized that, thanks to this invention, yet one more was added to the many factors that taken as a whole constantly lead them into error and render their 'being-mentation,' already weakened without this, year by year more 'gelatinous.' "On account of their new word 'doctor,' even our Ahoon, in spite of having
an incomparably more normal presence than theirs, and a being-Reason of
much higher quality, once had a very disagreeable and even idiotic
misadventure on that planet.
"But it would be much better, in my opinion, if he told you about it himself.
With these words, Beelzebub turned to Ahoon and said: "Do tell us, old fellow, how this all happened and what it was that all day
long for several days made you 'skoolmatchit' and 'tsirikooakhivat' or, as the
three-brained beings of the planet Earth would say, 'grumble' and 'sputter' like
your friend 'Dame Bess.' "



Then Ahoon, again imitating the style of Beelzebub and even his very
intonation, began to relate as follows:
"This misadventure of mine occurred in the following circumstances:
"During this sixth visit of ours to the planet Earth, toward the very end we
had to exist for a while in the capital of those German beings who, as His
Right Reverence deigned to say, invented this 'accursed' word 'doctor.'
"In the hotel where we had our place of residence, next to my room or, as
is said, in the 'number' next to mine, there existed two very agreeable beings
who had only recently celebrated the sacrament of the union of the active with
the passive for the purpose of serving the great all-universal
trogoautoegocratic process by the continuation of their species or, as your
favorites would say, they had not been 'married' long and were still considered
'newlyweds.'
"Well, by chance, I became acquainted with this young couple in the house
of some friends of mine, and after that they often invited me to their room for
what is called a 'cup of tea', and sometimes I even used to drop in on them
without being invited, in order to shorten the wearisome German evenings
"The passive half of this couple was, as is said there, in an 'interesting condition ' She was expecting her 'first-born.' "Like myself, they were in the capital for an indefinite period, for reasons
connected with the profession of the active half of this young couple and, as I
said, were staying in the same hotel that we were.
"His profession, by the way, was highly original, even according to the
notions of the beings of this incomparable planet He was famous in his own
country as one of the best specialists in the art of adorning the faces of his
clients with the 'scars' so dear to the students of German universities.
"One day I heard a nervous rapping on the wall of my room



"I instantly ran next door and found that the husband was not at home,
having had to go off somewhere just that day, meanwhile the young wife had
felt faint and, on the point of losing consciousness, instinctively rapped on the
wall.
"When I entered she already felt a little better, but implored me to hurry
for a doctor.
"Of course I rushed out into the street. But once there I thought 'And now where shall I go?' "Suddenly I remembered that not far from our hotel there lived a being
whom everybody called 'doctor,' and this title of 'doctor' was even engraved in
front of his name on a metal plate on the door of his house, so it was to this
house that I ran.
"But it turned out that he was at dinner, and his servant asked me to wait a
few minutes in the drawing-room, explaining that the doctor and his guests
would finish dinner immediately and would soon be coming out.
"So I sat down in the drawing-room to wait, but I cannot say that I sat very
quietly.
"I was sitting 'on live coals,' as they say, for I was most anxious about the
condition of my neighbor.
"The 'honorable doctor,' however, did not come Almost twenty minutes
passed I could bear it no longer and rang the bell.
"When the servant entered I begged her to remind the doctor about me and
to say that I was in a great hurry and could not wait for him any longer.
"She went away. "Another five minutes passed. "At last the doctor appeared. "I hurriedly explained to him what I had come for, but to my astonishment
he began to roar with laughter.
"I thought to myself 'Obviously while dining with his friends this doctor
has drunk a glass too many of German beer.



"And only when he had recovered a little from his hysterical laughter could
he tell me that to his great regret he was not a 'doctor of medicine' but only a
'doctor of philosophy.'
"At that moment I experienced such a state that it was as if I were hearing
for the second time the sentence of exile passed by our Endlessness upon His
Right Reverence and those nearest him, and in consequence upon me.
"Well, dear Hassein! "I left the drawing room of that doctor and was once more out in the street,
in the same predicament as before.
"Just then a 'taxi' happened to come along. "I jumped into it, asking myself 'Where now?' "Then I remembered that in a café where I sometimes went, I often noticed
a being whom everybody called 'doctor. '
"I ordered the driver to hurry to that café. "There a waiter I knew told me that this doctor had indeed been there but
had just left with some of his acquaintances, and that he had accidentally
overheard them mention the name of a restaurant where they were going, and
he gave me the address.
"Although this restaurant was some distance away, I told the driver to take
me there, as I knew of no other doctor.
"At long last, after half an hour, we reached the restaurant and I soon found this doctor. "Once again it turned out that he was not a physician, but a 'doctor of
jurisprudence .'
"This time I was really, as is said there, 'up against it. ' "Finally it entered my head to address myself to the head-waiter of the
restaurant and tell him exactly what I was looking for.
"This headwaiter turned out to be very obliging He not only explained to me what had to be done, but even accom



panied me to the house of a certain physician, this time called a 'doctor of obstetrics.' "Fortunately we found him at home and he was good enough to agree to come with me immediately But before we got there my poor neighbor had already brought forth her 'first-born.',' a boy, and having somehow swaddled the baby without anyone's help, was sound asleep after the terrible suffering she had endured in solitude. "And so, from that day on, I have with my whole being detested the sound of the word 'doctor,' and I would advise each of the beings of the planet Earth to use this word only when he is very, very angry. "In order that you may understand better the significance of contemporary physicians on your planet, I must also impart to you the following saying of our highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin. "He speaks of them thus: 'For our sins, God has sent us two kinds of physicians, one to help us die, the other to prevent us from living.' "



CHAPTER 32
Hypnotism
"AND SO," Beelzebub continued, "during this sixth and last sojourn of mine on the surface of the planet Earth, I decided to settle there for a long stay and to become a professional physician And I did indeed become one, only not such as most of them are, I chose instead the profession of what they call 'physician-hypnotist. ' "I became one of these professionals in the first place because in recent centuries they are the only ones on that planet who have access to all the 'classes' or 'castes' I spoke of and, since they inspire great confidence and possess authority, they evoke in ordinary beings a sincerity that enables these professionals to penetrate, as is said, their 'inner world. ' "And second, I chose this profession in order to have the possibility, while attaining my personal aim, also to give genuine medical assistance to some of those unfortunates. "Indeed, my boy, during recent times, among all the beings of whatever
class, on all the continents of that planet, there has been—and there still is—a
great need for such physicians.
"I may say that I already had a wide experience in this specialty, since during my previous elucidations of certain subtleties of the psyche of individual favorites of yours, I had had recourse many times to the methods used there by this kind of physician. "I must tell you that formerly your favorites, like all the other threebrained beings of the Universe, did not possess the particular psychic property that permits them to be brought into what is called a 'hypnotic state ' To fall into such a state became proper to your favorites owing to certain



combinations in their psyche arising from the disharmony of the functioning of their common presence. "This strange psychic property appeared soon after the destruction of Atlantis and became fixed in the presence of every one of them from the time when their 'zoostat,' that is, the functioning of their 'being-consciousness,' began to be divided and there was gradually formed in them two entirely different consciousnesses having nothing in common with each other, the first of which they called simply 'consciousness,' and the second, when they finally noticed it in themselves, the 'subconscious.' "If you try to represent clearly to yourself and to transubstantiate in the corresponding parts of your common presence what I am about to explain, you will perhaps understand almost half of all the reasons why the psyche of your favorites breeding on the planet Earth has finally become such a unique phenomenon. "This psychic peculiarity of falling into a 'hypnotic state' is, as I have just said, inherent only in the three-brained beings of this planet of yours, and one can therefore say that if they did not exist, then in the whole of our Great Universe there would not exist even a being-notion of 'hypnotism.' "Before explaining more about all this, it is appropriate to emphasize that although during the last twenty centuries almost the entire ordinary waking existence of most of the three-brained beings who have taken your fancy, particularly of the contemporary ones, has proceeded under the influence of this property of theirs, they give the name of 'hypnotic state' only to that state during which the process of this peculiar property flows in them at an accelerated rate and produces concentrated results. "And they fail to notice or, as they would say, they are not 'struck by' the incongruous results of this property, recently fixed in the ordinary process of their existence, because, on the one hand, in the absence of normal self



perfecting, they lack what is called a 'wide horizon,' and on the other hand,
arising and existing according to the principle of itoklanotz, it has become
proper to them to forget very quickly what they perceive But when the results
of this property begin to 'acceleratedly concentrate,' all incongruous
manifestations, their own and those of others, become so real that they are
strikingly obvious and unavoidably perceptible even to their bobtailed Reason.
"And even if certain of them should by chance notice something illogical
in their own manifestations or those of another, then, not having the
knowledge of the 'law of type,' they ascribe it to the traits of character of the
given being.
"This abnormal property of their psyche was first observed by the learned
beings of the city of Gob in the country of Maralpleicie, and they even made it
the basis for a serious and detailed branch of their science which spread over
the whole planet under the name of 'the science of nonresponsible
manifestations of personality.'
"But later, when the turn of their 'periodic process of reciprocal destruction'
came around again, this important branch of their science, which was still
comparatively normal, began gradually to be forgotten, like all their good
attainments, and finally it also entirely disappeared.
"And it was only many centuries later that this branch of science showed signs of reviving. "But thanks to the fact that at this period most of the learned beings had
already become 'learned beings of new formation,' they 'sat upon' this revival
so hard that before the poor thing had time to develop, it soon found its way
onto the common rubbish heap.
"And this happened in the following manner: "A learned being named Mesmer, by birth from the country called 'Austria
Hungary' and modest unlike his contemporaries, once happened to notice
clearly in the course of



certain of his experiments the real duality of consciousness in beings like himself. "He was greatly impressed by this and devoted himself entirely to this question which interested him. "Continuing to observe and to study, he almost succeeded in understanding it. "But later, when he began making practical experiments to clear up certain details, it was then that there was manifested toward him a particularity proper to the 'learned beings of new formation' there. "This particularity of the terrestrial 'learned beings of new formation' is called 'pecking to death. ' "As this honest Austro-Hungarian learned being conducted his experiments not as all the learned scientists of 'new formation' had become mechanized to do, he was, as is the custom there, meticulously 'pecked to death.' "And the process of 'pecking to death' of this poor Mesmer was so effective that for nearly two centuries it has continued from generation to generation among the learned beings of the Earth. "For instance, all the books now dealing with the question of 'hypnotism'and there are thousands of them—always begin by saying that this Mesmer was neither more nor less than a rogue with an 'itching palm,' and a charlatan of the first water, but that our 'honest' and 'great' learned beings soon saw through him and prevented him from doing serious mischief. "The more the contemporary learned beings of this peculiar planet are 'idiots squared,' the more they criticize Mesmer and say or write every possible kind of absurdity to discredit him. "And in doing this, they criticize just that honest and humble learned being of their planet who, if he had not been 'pecked to death,' would have revived the only science which



is absolutely necessary for them and by means of which alone they might perhaps be saved from the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer. "There is no harm in noting here that just before I left that planet forever, precisely the same thing as had occurred to this Mesmer was being repeated there On this occasion the victim was an honest and humble learned being belonging to the community of 'France,' who after persistent and conscientious labors came across the possibility of curing that terrible disease so widely spread in recent times that it now exists on a general planetary scal.e
"This terrible disease is called 'cancer.' "As this Frenchman also made practical experiments to elucidate the details of his discovery not in the customary way, other contemporary scientists thereupon manifested toward him that same particularity of 'pecking to death.' "Possibly now, my boy, there begin to be crystallized in your presence data for engendering an 'unshakable conviction' that thanks to the learned beings of 'new formation'— in whom this particularity has been implanted of not failing to 'peck to death' every colleague of theirs who does not conform to what has been established by the abnormal conditions of ordinary beingexistence—what is called the sacred 'antkooano,' upon which, among other things, the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash also counted, no longer proceeds in the presence of the three-brained beings of this ill-fated planet. "I chanced to learn about this 'essence-loving hope' of his during my investigations of his very saintly activities there. "Perhaps, my boy, you still do not know about the cosmic process of the sacred 'antkooano'? "The sacred 'antkooano' is the name given to the process of perfecting Objective Reason in three-centered beings, which takes place by itself simply from the 'flow of time. '
"As a rule, on all the planets of our Great Universe where



three-brained beings breed, the perfecting of Objective Reason can proceed only from personal conscious labor and intentional suffering. "This sacred 'antkooano' can take place only on those planets on which all cosmic truths have become known to all the beings there. "And all cosmic truths become known to everyone on those planets because those beings who by their conscious efforts learn some truth or other share it with others, and in this way, little by little, all cosmic truths become known to all the beings of that planet, whatever may be their aspirations and degree of self-perfecting. "Thanks to this sacred process, intentionally actualized by our AllForeseeing Common Endless Father in the three-brained beings of these planets, it has been foreseen that during the action in their presence of the fundamental holy cosmic law of Triamazikamno, the excess of its third holy force, namely, the 'Holy Reconciling,' obtained during the assimilation of cosmic truths of that order, should by itself crystallize in them the data for engendering that 'something' which is called 'egoaitoorassian being-will. '
"And so, my boy, this property of 'falling into a hypnotic state,' recently fixed in the common presence of your favorites, consists in this, that the functioning of their 'zoo-stat,' or as they themselves would say, their 'spiritual part,' passes into that functioning of their common 'whole' which normally proceeds during their completely passive state, that is, during their 'sleep,' while the entire functioning of their planetary body remains as it has become proper for it to be during their 'waking state. ' "In order that you should more clearly represent to yourself and understand the results flowing from this astonishing psychic property, you must know first of all about two facts regarding the common presence of these favorites of yours.



"One of these facts appears in their common presence owing to the cosmic
law of the 'self-adaptability' of Nature, and the other derives from those
abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence they themselves have
established, and about which I have repeatedly spoken.
"The first fact is that, from the time when, owing to their abnormal
existence, there was formed in them the 'two-system zoostat,' that is, two
independent consciousnesses, Great Nature gradually adapted herself to this
until finally it came about that, after your favorites reach a certain age, there
begin to proceed in them two 'inkliatzanikshanas' of different tempos or, as
they themselves would say, two different modes of 'blood circulation.'
"From this age on, each of these 'inkliatzanikshanas' or 'blood circulations'
of different tempo evokes the functioning of one of their consciousnesses, and
vice versa, the intensive functioning of either consciousness evokes the mode
of 'blood circulation' corresponding to it.
"The difference between these two independent modes of blood circulation
in their common presence depends on what is called the 'tempodavlakshernian
circulation' or, according to the expression of their contemporary 'medicine,'
the 'extent of filling of the blood vessels', in other words, in the conditions of
the 'waking state,' the 'center of gravity of the blood pressure' in their common
presence is situated in one part of the general system of 'blood vessels,'
whereas in the conditions of the passive state it is in another part.
"The second fact ensuing from the abnormal conditions of being-existence
of your favorites is that, from the first moment of the arising of their offspring,
in order to make them correspond to these abnormal conditions around them,
they intentionally try by every available means to fix in their 'logicnestarian
localizations' as many impressions as possible derived exclusively from the
artificial perceptions due to the results of their abnormal existence—and this
maleficent ac



tion toward their offspring they call 'education ' The totality of these artificial
perceptions gradually becomes isolated in their common presence and
acquires its own independent functioning, related with the functioning of their
planetary body only as much as is necessary for its automatic manifestation
And it is this totality of artificial perceptions which, owing to their naïveté,
they now regard as their real 'consciousness.'
"As for the sacred data put into them by Great Nature for genuine being
consciousness—the consciousness which they ought to have from the very
beginning of their preparation for responsible existence, along with the
properties inherent in them for engendering the genuine sacred being
impulses of Faith, Hope, Love, and Conscience—these data also gradually
become isolated in their presence and, remaining apart, they evolve
independently of the intentions of the responsible beings surrounding them as
well as of the beings themselves, and come to be regarded as what is called
the 'subconscious. '
"It is solely on account of this behavior toward their offspring—maleficent
in the objective sense, but 'benevolent' according to their naive subjective
understanding—that all the sacred data put into them by Great Nature for
forming their real being-consciousness become isolated and remain during the
entire period of their existence in an almost primitive state And all the
impressions inevitably perceived by means of the six 'being-skernalitsioniks'
or, in their terminology, 'sense organs,' existing in their presence specifically
for the perception of externals—which, by the way, they count as five—come
to be localized and, acquiring their independent functioning, gradually
become predominant in the whole of their common presence.
"Although this 'localization' of accidentally perceived impressions exists in
them and they are aware of its action, it plays no part in any functioning
inherent in their planetary



body or in the acquisition in their common presence of Objective Reason.
"All these impressions intentionally or accidentally perceived, from which this localization is formed, should serve only as material for the confrontative logic of that real being-consciousness which they ought to have in themselves, and which sometimes produces accidental results that they, in their naïveté, now confidently regard as mere reflexes of their what is called 'animal instinct,' quite insignificant in their opinion. "Thanks only to the fact that your favorites, especially the contemporary ones, do not know or even suspect the necessity at least to adapt their famous education to the subconscious of their offspring but always and in everything intentionally help every one of the rising generation to perceive impressions only from what is abnormally artificial, when any one of them reaches responsible age all his being-judgments and the deductions he draws from them are purely subjective And these judgments and deductions have no connection either with the genuine being-impulses arising in him, or with those lawful cosmic phenomena that it is proper to the Reason of every threebrained being to sense, and by means of which a bond is established between all the three-brained beings of our Great Universe for the collective fulfillment of the common universal functioning, for which purpose everything existing in the Universe exists. "For your broader understanding of this particular 'psychic state' so disastrous for your favorites, I must tell you that they arise, even today, with every kind of data for acquiring genuine being-Reason, and at their arising their presence does not as yet contain any 'logicnestarian growths' from which later their 'false consciousness' is localized and acquires an independent functioning And it is only after this that during their development and preparation to become responsible beings, either by themselves or under the inten



tional direction of their 'parents' or 'teachers,' that is, those beings who
undertake to prepare them for responsible existence, they begin to take in and
fix exclusively those impressions which are data for impulses corresponding
to the abnormally established conditions surrounding them And from then on
there is gradually formed and predominates in their common presence this
artificially formed 'consciousness' of theirs.
"And as for the totality of the spiritualized data localized in their presence
for the purpose of genuine being-consciousness, which they call the
'subconscious,' since it neither has nor acquires any 'logicnestarian growths'
for confrontation and criticism, but from the very beginning has only the
possibility of engendering the sacred being-impulses called 'Faith,' 'Love,'
'Hope,' and 'Conscience,' it always believes, always loves, and always hopes
in everything newly perceived.
"Well, my boy, by altering the tempo of their blood circulation, it is
possible to suspend for a time the action of the localization of their false
consciousness, now the 'sovereign master' of their common presence, thus
enabling the sacred data of their genuine consciousness to blend freely with
the general functioning of their planetary body during their waking state, and
if one then assists, in the required way, the crystallization of data which give
rise in this localization to an idea contrary to what is already fixed there, and
if one directs the action of this idea to a disharmonized part of the planetary
body, one can bring about in that part a rapid change in the blood circulation.
"During the period of the Tikliamishian civilization, when the learned
beings of the country of Maralpleicie discovered for the first time this
possibility of 'combinations' in their general psyche and tried to put each
other, at will, into this special state, they soon found out and understood how
to obtain it with the help of what is called 'being-hanbledzoin,'



that is to say, that cosmic substance which in its essence the three-brained
beings of contemporary civilization came very close to understanding and
which they called 'animal magnetism. '
"Now, my boy, I find it necessary for the given case and also perhaps for
my further explanations to inform you in more detail about the cosmic
substance called 'being-hanbledzoin.'
" 'Hanbledzoin' is nothing else than the 'blood' of the 'kesdjan body' of the
being, and just as the sum total of cosmic substances called 'blood' serves for
the nourishment and renewal of the planetary body of the being, so in the
same way 'hanbledzoin' serves for nourishing and perfecting the kesdjan body.
"You should know that in general the quality of the composition of the
blood in the common presence of your favorites, as in all three-brained beings,
depends on the number of being-bodies already completely formed in them.
"Blood, in the presence of three-brained beings, may be composed of
substances arising from the transformation of three distinct and independent
'cosmic sources of actualization. '
"The substances of that part of the being-blood designed by Nature for
serving the planetary body arise from the transformation of substances of that
planet on which the given being is formed and exists.
"But the substances designed for serving the kesdjan body of the being,
which in their totality are called 'hanbledzoin,' are obtained from the
transformation of elements of other planets and of the sun itself of that system
where this three-brained being has the place of his arising and existence.
"Finally, that part of the being-blood which almost everywhere is called the
sacred 'aiëssakhladonn,' and which serves the highest part of the being called
the 'soul,' derives from the direct emanations of our Most Holy Sun Absolute.



"Substances required for the blood of the planetary body of beings enter into them through their 'first being-food' or what your favorites simply call 'food. ' "But the substances needed both for coating and for perfecting the 'higher being-body,' that is, the 'kesdjan body,' enter into their common presence through their 'breathing,' and through certain what are called 'pores' of the skin. "As for the sacred cosmic substances required for the coating of the
'highest being-body,' which they call the 'soul,' these substances can be
assimilated and correspondingly transformed and coated in them, just as in us,
only through the process of what is called 'aiësiritoorassian contemplation,'
actualized in their common presence with the conscious participation of their
three independent spiritualized parts.
"You will be able to understand about all those cosmic substances with which the three independent being-bodies are coated and perfected in the common presences of certain of your favorites only when, as I have already promised, I tell you about the fundamental cosmic laws of world-creation and world-existence, nevertheless, to throw more light on our present subject, it is necessary to explain a little about the changed form of actualization in the common presence of your favorites of the 'second being-food' automatically taken in by them. "At first, after the destruction of the organ kundabuffer, when they, like all the other three-brained beings of our Great Universe, had a 'fulasmtamnian existence,' this second being-food was transformed normally, and all the principal elements composing it—those which arise from transformations on their own planet and those which flow into their atmosphere from transformations in other concentrations of their solar system—were assimilated by their common presences according to definite data already in them, and the surplus of certain of the component elements of this food,



not used by individual beings, passed automatically, as with us, into the
possession of meritorious beings around them.
"But later, as I have already said, when most of them began to exist in a
manner unbecoming to three-brained beings, Great Nature was constrained to
change their 'fulasmtamnian existence' into an existence according to the
principle of itoklanotz And from then on, in the presence of most of them,
owing to their abnormal being-existence, those definite crystallizations
foreseen by Great Nature which compose the most important part of the
second being-food and which, when assimilated by beings, are transformed
into substances for the coating and perfecting of their 'kesdjan body,'
gradually ceased to be assimilated either consciously or automatically for this
purpose And since these substances, transformed in other cosmic
concentrations, kept on flowing all the time into the atmosphere of their
planet, there arose in recent centuries among your unfortunate favorites yet
another new 'disease' with a specially harmful action upon them.
"The point is that, not being used up for their predetermined purpose, these
definite cosmic crystallizations, in the course of displacements of the
atmosphere, concentrate in certain atmospheric strata and enter into your
favorites, from time to time, in accordance with external surrounding con
ditions as well as with the inner state of their common presence, which by the
way depends chiefly on the form of their mutual relationships And so these
cosmic crystallizations enter into them as into apparatuses foreordained by
Nature for the transformation of cosmic substances needed for serving the
aims of the Most Great Common-Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat and, not meeting
with 'substrata' that correspond to the requirements of the lawful process of
'djartklom,' and thanks to other accidental factors, these crystallizations,
during their subsequent evolutionary or involutionary transformations into
new crystallizations proper



to this planet, even before these transformations are complete, produce upon planetary bodies the action which is characteristic of this specific new disease. "Here perhaps I should add that this disease, with such a definite cause, was given different names by your favorites at different times on various parts of the surface of your planet, and the contemporary beings likewise give it different names and wiseacre in all sorts of ways to explain its origin "Among the many names for this disease of theirs the most widely used at the present time are 'grippe,' 'influenza,' 'Spanish influenza,' 'dengue,' and others. "As regards the second kind of being-food, the absorption of which
continues among beings even until now, ever since your favorites lost the
possibility of existing according to the fulasnitamnian principle certain of its
elements continue to serve only for assisting the transformation of the first
being-food and for removing from the planetary body certain elements that
have already been utilized.
"Now, my boy, let us come back to that particular psychic property of your favorites, and the way in which I made use of it for my activities among them at that time in the capacity of a 'specialist in hypnotism. ' "Although this 'hypnotism' or, as they prefer to say, this branch of their
'science,' arose and became official only recently, it has already become
another of the serious factors for a still greater confusion of the psyche of
most of them, confused enough without this, and for deranging still further
the functioning of their planetary body.
"After I had become one of these professionals called a 'physicianhypnotist,' I grew quite interested in this official 'science' of theirs, and later, when I made my usual investigations of certain serious questions, for instance, of the results of the activities of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, and I chanced to come across something bearing upon this



branch of their science, I was also able to make clear to my Reason this
'misunderstanding' there.
"Since the impelling causes of the revival of this branch of their science,
which occurred automatically as is usual today, consisted in certain
exceedingly peculiar and, as they might say, 'piquant' facts, it will be
interesting in my opinion to tell you in more detail about this 'revival.'
"Although contemporary learned beings maintain that the originator of this
branch of their science was a certain English professor named Brade and that
it was developed by the French physician Charcot, in reality this was not so at
all.
"My detailed investigations of this question, by the way, made it clear to
me that the former, Brade, had unmistakable signs of the properties of a
hasnamuss, and the latter, Charcot, the typical properties of a 'mama's darling
"And terrestrial types like this could never have discovered anything
completely new.
"As a matter of fact, it appeared that what happened was the following:
"A certain Italian abbot, Pedrini by name, was what is called a 'confessor'
for a convent in his town.
"A nun named Ephrosinia often came to this abbot for confession.
"As the story went, it seems that she frequently fell into a certain
particular state, and while in this state she displayed manifestations unusual
for her environment.
"During confession she complained to the abbot Pedrini that at times she
felt herself unmistakably under the influence of 'diabolical suggestions.'
"Everything she told him and the stories circulated about her intrigued the
abbot Pedrini, and he became very much interested in verifying it all for
himself.
"One day, during confession, he tried by every possible means to evoke sincerity in this nun, and succeeded in find



ing out that this young 'novice' once had a lover, who had given her his portrait in a very beautiful frame, and that during periods of 'rest' from her prayers she allowed herself to gaze at this picture of her 'sweetheart', and it was just during these periods of 'rest' that it seemed to her that she became 'possessed of the devil.' "All this, frankly told by the nun, excited the abbot's interest still further, and he decided at all costs to find out the cause of this phenomenon With this aim in view he asked the nun Ephrosinia to be sure to bring with her the next time the portrait of her lover, in its frame .
"So at the next confession the nun brought this portrait. "There was nothing very special about the portrait itself, but the frame was indeed unusual, being all encrusted with 'mother-of-pearl' and various colored stones. "While the abbot and the nun were both examining the portrait and its frame, he suddenly noticed that something very strange was happening to the nun. "First she became pale and for a certain time as if turned to stone, and then all at once there began in her precisely the same manifestations, in all details, as occur between the newly married on what is called the 'first night.' "After seeing this, the abbot Pedrini was all the more consumed with desire to understand the causes of such an astonishing manifestation. "But as for the nun, two hours after this strange state of hers began, she recovered, and it was evident that she knew and remembered nothing of what had happened to he.r "As the abbot could not decipher this phenomenon by himself, he turned for help to one of his acquaintances, a certain Doctor Bambini. "Well, when the abbot Pedrini told everything in detail to the doctor Bambini, he also became very much interested, and they both began to occupy themselves with this question.



"They first made a number of elucidatory experiments upon the nun Ephrosinia, and after several what are called 'séances,' they noticed that this nun invariably fell into this peculiar state when her gaze rested rather a long time on one of the brilliant colored stones called a 'Persian turquoise,' which was among the ornaments on the frame of the portrait. "But later, when they made experiments upon other people with this same 'Persian turquoise,' they became categorically convinced that almost any three-brained being, without distinction of sex, who gazes for a long time at shining and brilliant objects of certain kinds, falls into a state similar to the one that proceeded in the first subject of their experiments Furthermore they noticed that the manifestations during this state vary with each subject and depend on the being-experiences that were predominant on some former occasion, and on the shining objects with which a connection was accidentally established during these experiences of theirs. "Well, my boy, as soon as information about the observations, deductions, and experiments of these two beings belonging to the community of 'Italy' spread among the contemporary 'learned beings of new formation,' many of them began to wiseacre about it, and when by chance, as is usual for them, they finally learned that in this state it is possible to change formerly fixed impressions very quickly into new ones, certain of them began to use this particular psychic property, inherent in them, for medical purposes. "And from then on, they called this mode of healing 'hypnotic treatment,'
and those beings who practiced it were known as 'physician-hypnotists ' But
what this state of theirs is and why it occurs in them remains even up till now
a question that they cannot answer.
"From that time on hundreds of 'theories,' still current today, made their appearance, as well as thousands of heavy



volumes devoted to this question, muddling still further the Reason of the ordinary three-brained beings of this ill-fated planet, already sufficiently muddled without that. "This branch of their science has come to be perhaps even more maleficent for them than the fantastic inventions of the ancient Hellenic fishermen and of the contemporary beings of the community of Germany. "Thanks merely to this branch of their science, there were acquired in the psyche of the ordinary beings of this ill-fated planet several new forms of what are called 'being-kalkali' —that is, 'essential strivings'—which appeared in the guise of certain definite new teachings existing under the names of 'anoklinism,' 'Darwinism,' 'Anthroposophism,' 'Theosophism,' and many others with names also ending in 'ism,' with the result that even those two data in their presence, which still helped them to be at least a little as three-centered beings should be, have finally disappeared in them. "These essential data, which until quite recently have been present in them,
engendered the being-impulses they called 'patriarchality' and 'religious
feeling. '
"This branch of their contemporary science was the cause not only of the
appearance of several additional and pernicious 'kalkali' in their common
presence, but also of the further derangement in many of them of the abnormal
functioning of their psyche, which to their great misfortune had long since
been disharmonized to the degree of 'alnokoorian cacophony.'
"You will understand this very well if I tell you that when I was existing on the continent called 'Europe' and in neighboring countries, and was again practicing as a 'specialist in hypnotism,' almost half my patients were ill on account of the wide dissemination of that maleficent science. "And this came about because the 'learned beings of new formation' were writing many books full of preposterous theories about this question, and when the ordinary beings



read them they became infatuated with these fantasies and began trying to put each other into this hypnotic state, thus bringing themselves to the point of becoming my patients. "Among such patients of mine were women whose husbands, having chanced to read these works, wished to suggest their egoistic desires to their wives, also the children of unreasonable parents, and various men who were under the sway or, as is said there, 'under the thumb' of their mistresses, and so on and so forth And all this because these sorry 'learned beings of new formation' cooked up their hasnamussian theories about this distressing state of theirs . "None of the theories current among them on the question of hypnotism corresponds in the least to reality. "Most recently, by the way, when I was on this unfortunate planet, a new maleficent means began to nourish there for producing on the psyche of beings the same effect as was and still is produced through that branch of their science called 'hypnotism. ' "And this new maleficent means is named 'psychoanalysis.' "You must without fail also know that when the beings of the period of the Tikliamishian civilization observed this peculiar psychic property for the first time, and understood that by its means certain other properties particularly unbecoming to them could be destroyed, the process of bringing someone into this state came to be regarded as a sacred process and was performed only in their temples before the whole congregation. "But your contemporary favorites, on the contrary, do not feel in their presence the slightest 'being-impulse of contrition' in regard to this property of theirs, nor do they consider as 'sacred' its concentrated manifestation, when intentionally evoked in case of need, and they have even adapted the process itself and its accidentally obtained results for serving as a means of 'tickling' certain of the



definitively fixed consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer.
"For instance, even when they meet together to celebrate some established
'patriarchal rite' such as a 'wedding,' 'baptism,' 'birthday,' and so on, one of
their great diversions is trying to bring one another into this state.
"It is lucky that they do not know—and let us hope that they never will
know—any other method than the one discovered for the first time by those
beings of the community of Italy, the abbot Pedrini and the doctor Bambini,
namely, that of gazing at a shining object, by which means, as I have already
told you, certain of them can indeed be brought into this 'concentrated
hypnotic state.'



CHAPTER 33
Beelzebub as professional hypnotist
BEELZEBUB resumed his tale as follows "When I existed among your favorites as a professional hypnotist I carried out my experiments on their psyche chiefly by means of that particular state which contemporary beings there call the 'hypnotic state. ' "To bring them into this state, I had recourse at first to the same means used by the beings of the Tikliamishian civilization for this purpose, that is to say, I acted upon them with my own 'hanbledzoin.' "But later, as the being-impulse called 'love of kind' frequently arose in my common presence, I had to produce this state in a great many threebrained beings there not only for my personal aims but for their benefit as well, and since this proved to be very harmful for my being-existence, I invented another means by which I obtained the same effect without the expenditure of my own 'hanbledzoin. ' "My invention, which I immediately put into practice, consisted in inducing a rapid change in what I have called the 'extent of the filling of the blood vessels,' by a particular way of hindering the circulation in certain blood vessels. "By means of this hindering I was able, even while the mechanized tempo
of the blood circulation of their 'waking state' was maintained, to bring about
at the same time the functioning of their real consciousness, that is, the one
they call their 'subconscious. '
"This new means of mine proved to be incomparably superior to the one
still used today by the beings of your planet, which consists in making the
person they hypnotize gaze at a shining object.
"Of course it is possible, as I have already told you, to



bring them into that psychic state by making them look fixedly at a shining
object, but this method does not work with all beings there—far from it And
the reason for this is that, even though fixing their gaze on a shining object
may bring about a change in the 'extent of the filling of the blood vessels,' the
chief factor for this change must be their own intentional or automatic
concentration of thought and feeling.
"And this concentration can only be obtained from an intense expectation,
or from a process taking place in them which they express by the word 'faith,'
or again, from the emotion of 'fear of something about to happen,' or finally
from those passions whose functioning has become inherent in the presence
of these beings, such as 'hate,' 'love,' 'sensuality,' 'curiosity,' and so on and so
forth.
"That is why in beings who are called 'hysterical,' who have lost for a
time, if not forever, the ability to concentrate their 'thought' and 'feeling,' it is
impossible to bring about a change in the 'extent of the filling of the blood
vessels' by having them fix their gaze on a shining object, and hence it is
impossible to induce the 'hypnotic state' in them by this means.
"But with my invention, that is, a specific action upon the 'blood vessels'
themselves, it was possible to bring into this state not only anyone you please
of these terrestrial three-brained beings, but even many one-brained and two
brained beings breeding there, as for instance various 'quadrupeds,' 'fish,'
'birds,' and so on.
"As regards that impulse of love of kind, which led me to seek a new
means of bringing your favorites into this state which had by now become
proper to them, it arose and gradually became dominant in me chiefly
because, during this period of my therapeutic activities, the ordinary three
brained beings of all castes everywhere soon began to love and respect me,
regarding me almost as one sent from



Above to help them free themselves from their pernicious habits, in short, they
began to manifest toward me their most sincere, almost genuine being
impulse of 'oskolnikoo' or, as they say, 'appreciation' and 'gratitude.'
"Nor was it only those I saved and their closest relatives who showed this
'being-oskolnikoo' or 'gratitude' toward me, but almost everyone who was in
contact with me or heard of me in one way or another, with the sole exception
of those professionals who were their physicians.
"These latter, on the contrary, hated me intensely and strained every nerve
to impair the good feelings which ordinary beings had for me, and they hated
me simply because I soon became their serious rival.
"Strictly speaking, they had every reason to hate me, because only a few
days after my therapeutic activities began, hundreds of patients attended my
daily consultations, with hundreds of others knocking at the door, while my
poor rivals had to sit for days on end in their famous 'consulting rooms,'
anxiously awaiting any odd patient who might stray in like a 'lost sheep. '
"And they waited with such impatience for these 'lost sheep' because some
of them could be transformed into what are called 'milch cows' from which
they milked, as was already customary there, that something they call 'dough '
"In all fairness to them, however, it must be said that without this 'dough' it
has become quite impossible to exist there in recent times, particularly for
those contemporary three-brained beings who become famous physicians.
"And so, my boy, as I have already told you, I began my activities as a
physician-hypnotist in the center of the continent of Asia, in various towns of
'Turkestan.'
"I stayed first in towns of the part of Turkestan which was later called
'Chinese Turkestan' to distinguish it from that part which, after its conquest by
the beings belonging



to the large community of Russia, was named 'Russian Turkestan.'
"In the towns of Chinese Turkestan there was a great need for physicians
of my specialty, because at that period there had developed more intensely
than usual among the three-brained beings breeding on that part of the surface
of your planet two most pernicious 'organic habits,' which had become proper
to them to acquire in their presence.
"One of these pernicious organic habits was the 'smoking of opium' and
the other was the 'chewing of anasha' or, as it is otherwise called, 'hashish.'
"As you already know, they obtain this 'opium' from the poppy plant, and
'hashish' is extracted from a surplanetary formation called 'chakla' or 'hemp.'
"And so, at this period of my activities, I existed at first mainly in various
towns of Chinese Turkestan, but later on, circumstances so fell out that I
preferred to stay in the towns of Russian Turkestan.
"Among the beings of Russian Turkestan, the first of these pernicious
habits or, as they sometimes say, 'vices'— namely, the smoking of opium
was almost nonexistent, and the chewing of anasha was even rarer, but on the
other hand, the use of what is called Russian 'vodka' was in full flower.
"This harmful product is obtained chiefly from the surplanetary formation
called the 'potato. '
"From the use of 'vodka,' just as from 'opium' and 'anasha,' not only does
the psyche of these ill-fated three-brained beings become utterly farcical but,
in addition, certain important parts of their planetary body little by little
degenerate completely.
"Here I may say that it was just at the beginning of these activities of mine
among your favorites that, in order to further my investigations of their
psyche, I began keeping those 'statistics' which later so greatly interested
certain



Very Saintly Cosmic Individuals of the highest gradations of Reason.
"Well then, my boy, while existing as a physician among the beings breeding
in the towns of Turkestan, I had to work so hard, especially toward the end of
my stay there, that certain functions of my planetary body began to get out of
order, so I started to consider how I might give up my activities, at least for a
while, and do nothing but rest.
"I could of course have gone home to the planet Mars for this purpose, but
there arose before me my own individual 'being-dimtzoneero,' that is, my
being-duty toward the 'essence-word' I had given myself.
"And the 'essence-word' I had given myself at the beginning of my sixth
descent was to exist among your favorites until I had finally made clear to my
Reason all the causes of the gradual formation in their common presence of
that exceptionally strange being-psyche.
"And as I had not yet fulfilled this 'essence-word' I had given myself, not
having had time to learn all the details needed for a full elucidation of the
problem, I considered a return to the planet Mars premature.
"But to remain in Turkestan and organize my existence in such a way as to
give my planetary body the required rest was not possible, because in almost
all the beings breeding on that part of the surface of your planet, both in
Chinese and in Russian Turkestan, there had already been crystallized, either
through personal perceptions or from the descriptions of others, data for
recognizing my appearance And by now each of the ordinary beings of this
country wished to speak with me, either about himself or someone close to
him, regarding one of those pernicious 'vices' and the means of deliverance
from it—means in which I had happened to become such an unparalleled
specialist.



"What I then devised and earned out to escape from this situation had the
result that Turkestan—concerning which, there were fixed and will always be
preserved in my common presence data for pleasant memories—ceased to be
my permanent place of existence on your planet during this last stay of mine,
and thereafter the cities of their 'famous' Europe with their 'cafés' serving a
'black liquid,' made of nobody knows what, replaced the towns of Turkestan
with their 'chaikhanas' and their delicious fragrant teas.
"I decided to go to the country on the continent of Africa which is called
'Egypt.'
"I chose this country of Egypt because it was at that period an ideal place
for resting, and many three-brained beings who were 'well off,' as they say,
went there for that purpose from all the other continents.
"On my arrival I settled down in the city called 'Cairo' and very soon
organized the external form of my ordinary existence so as to have the rest
needed by my planetary body after those intense and strenuous labors of mine.
"Do you remember my telling you that I went to Egypt for the first time
during my fourth descent to the surface of your planet in order to collect, with
the help of several beings of our tribe existing in that country, a certain
number of those accidentally arisen 'misconceptions' called 'apes'? I also told
you that I inspected many unusual works of architecture there, among them
that original observatory for the study of cosmic concentrations which had
greatly interested me.
"By the time of my sixth descent, scarcely anything remained of all the
numerous interesting constructions of the past.
"They had either been destroyed by the beings themselves during their
wars and revolutions, or had been covered over by sands.
"These sands were a consequence partly of the great winds



I have already mentioned, and partly of a planetary tremor which was later
called by the beings of Egypt the 'alnepoossian earthquake.'
"During this planetary tremor, an island then called 'Siapoora,' situated to
the north of a still existing island named 'Cyprus,' gradually, over a period of
five terrestrial years, sank into the planet in a very peculiar way And while
this process lasted, extraordinary 'low' and 'high tides,' as they are called, were
produced in the great spaces of the surrounding 'saliakooriap,' as a result of
which vast quantities of sand from beneath the saliakooriap rose to the surface
of this terra firma, and became mixed with the sand blown there by the winds.
"But do you know, my boy, while I have been telling you all this about
Egypt, it has gradually dawned on me, and my whole being has finally
become aware, that I committed an unpardonable error in the course of my
tales about the three-brained beings breeding on the planet Earth.
"Do you remember, I once told you that not one of the achievements of the
beings of past generations had ever reached the beings of subsequent
generations?
"Well, I am now aware that I made a mistake about this. "During my preceding tales about these beings who have taken your fancy,
not once was there recalled in my being-associations an event that took place
just the day before my final flight from the surface of that planet, and which
proved that after all something did reach even your contemporary favorites
from the achievements of the beings of the remote past.
"The emanations of joy that arose in me at the moment of my pardon by
our Omnipotent All-Just Creator Endlessness and from His gracious
permission to return to the bosom of my first arising must have prevented me
from absorbing that impression with enough intensity to bring about the
complete crystallization in the corresponding parts



of my common whole of the data that can engender in beings, during being
associations evoked by manifestations of the same source, a repetition of what
has previously been experienced.
"But just now, as I was speaking of this contemporary Egypt, and pictures
of certain localities that had pleased me on that part of your planet were
revived before my being-sight, the faint impressions I had retained of this
event gradually became coated into a definite awareness, and came back
clearly to my memory.
"Before telling you about this event which can only be described as deeply
tragic, and to give you a clearer representation of it, I must speak again about
the three-brained beings of the continent of Atlantis who had founded the
learned society under the name of 'Akhldann.'
"Certain members of this society who already had some idea of the sacred
Omnipresent Okidanokh discovered, by persistent labors, how to obtain from
their own atmosphere and also from certain surplanetary formations each of
its holy parts separately, and how these sacred, cosmic 'force-bearing'
substances, when kept in a concentrated form, could be useful to them for
their scientific experiments.
"The learned members of this great society also discovered among other
things that, by means of the separately localized third part of the Omnipresent
Okidanokh, namely, the sacred 'neutralizing force' or 'force of reconciling,'
they were able to bring a planetary 'organic' formation of any kind into such a
state that its presence would conserve forever all the active elements
contained in it at the given moment, in other words, they could suspend and
even completely stop its inevitable what is called 'decay. '
"The knowledge of the power to accomplish this passed by inheritance to
certain beings of Egypt, namely, those initiated beings who were the direct
descendants of the learned members of the Akhldanns.



"Well then, many centuries after the loss of Atlantis, beings of this Egypt,
starting from the knowledge that had reached them, succeeded in preserving
the planetary bodies of certain of them forever—again by means of the holy
'neutralizing force' of the sacred Okidanokh—in a nondecaying and
nondecomposing state after the sacred 'rascooarno' or, as they say there, after
their 'death. '
"To be sure, by the time of my sixth visit to that planet, all the beings and
everything that had been in this Egypt during my former visit had entirely
ceased to exist and not even the slightest notion of any of this knowledge
remained But the planetary bodies to which they had applied the afore
mentioned means were still intact and exist there even up to the present.
"And contemporary beings call these surviving planetary bodies
'mummies.'
"The transformation of planetary bodies into 'mummies' was accomplished
by the beings of Egypt very simply They kept the body destined to this
purpose for about half a month in what they call 'castor oil,' and later they
introduced into it the sacred 'substance-force,' dissolved in a corresponding
way.
"Well, my boy, according to the research and investigations of one of our
countrymen who exists there to this day, and about which I was informed by
etherogram after my final departure from your planet, it appears that just
when a process of reciprocal destruction began between the beings of this
Egypt and those of a neighboring community, the existence of one of their
'pharaohs' came to an end Now the beings whose business it was to preserve
forever the bodies of meritorious beings were unable, owing to the approach
of their enemies, to keep the planetary body of this pharaoh in castor oil as
long as was necessary, that is, for half a month Nevertheless, they put this
body into castor oil, then placed it in a hermetically sealed chamber and,



having dissolved the aforesaid sacred 'substance-force' in a certain way, they introduced it into the chamber also, in order to obtain the desired result. "It transpired that this sacred 'force,' effectively accomplishing what they had expected, was preserved in this hermetically sealed chamber and, as always takes place from the action of what are called 'catalysts,' remained in its integral state until quite recently. "This sacred 'something' would have remained in its pristine state for untold centuries among these three-brained beings who long ago ceased to have any 'reverence' in their essence, but since in the presences of these contemporary 'unconscious desecrators' a criminal passion has arisen, evoking in them a need to despoil even the sanctuaries of beings of past generations, they dug down into this chamber which ought to have been for them a profoundly revered sanctuary And thus they committed that sacrilege, the result of which caused me to become aware with the whole of my being of my mistake—the mistake I made when I so confidently assured you that nothing whatever had reached the beings of contemporary civilization from the beings of long-past epochs, for this event which has recently occurred in Egypt is indeed a consequence of the results attained by those ancient ancestors of theirs who used to exist on the continent of Atlantis. "This result of the scientific attainments of the beings of long-past epochs
reached contemporary beings and became their possession for the following
reason.
"Perhaps, my dear Hassein, you already know, as do all the responsible beings of our Great Universe, whatever their degree of being-intelligenceeven those who are still in the second half of their preparation for responsible age—that the essence of the presence of the planetary body of every being, as of every 'relatively independent' cosmic unit, great or small, must consist of all three sacred 'substance-forces'



of the holy Triamazikamno, that is, the forces of the Holy Affirming, Holy
Denying, and Holy Reconciling, and must constantly maintain them in a
corresponding and balanced state And if for some reason or other an excess of
the vibrations of one of these three sacred forces enters into any presence, then
infallibly and unconditionally the sacred 'rascooarno' must occur to it, that is,
the total destruction of its ordinary existence.
"Well, my boy, on account of this criminal need to despoil the sanctuaries
of their ancestors which, as I have already told you, had arisen in the presence
of your contemporary favorites, certain of them committed the outrage of
breaking into the hermetically sealed chamber, then the sacred 'substance
force' of the Holy Reconciling, existing separately in that place, not having
sufficient time to blend with the space, entered into the presences of these
beings and manifested the property inherent in it according to law.
"I shall say nothing at this point about how the psyche of the three-brained
beings breeding on this part of the terra firma surface of your planet
degenerated and in what form it came to be molded.
"Perhaps some time later, in its proper place, I shall explain this to you also, meanwhile, let us return to our interrupted theme. "The program of my external existence while in Egypt included, among
other things, the practice of taking a walk every morning in the direction of
what are known as the 'Pyramids' and the 'Sphinx. '
"The Pyramids and Sphinx were the sole, pitiful remnants that chanced to
survive from those majestic works of art— erected by the descendants of the
most great Akhldanns and by the great ancestors of the beings of this Egypt
the building of which I had witnessed with my own eyes during my fourth
sojourn on your planet.
"But I failed to have a thorough rest in Egypt since cir



cumstances soon obliged me to leave. And, strictly speaking, the
circumstances that led to my departure were the reason why the towns of dear
Turkestan with their pleasant 'chaikhanas' were replaced, as I already told
you, by the cities of their famous contemporary center of culture, the
continent of Europe with its no less famous 'café-restaurants,' in which,
instead of fragrant teas, they serve you a black liquid consisting of nobody
knows what."



CHAPTER 34
Beelzebub in Russia
"ALL THE FURTHER events that took place during this last sojourn of mine on the surface of the planet Earth, connected with the abnormal form of the ordinary being-existence of those three-brained beings who please you, and many trifling incidents that threw light on the characteristic details of their peculiar psyche, began in this way. "One morning as I was walking near the Pyramids, an elderly stranger, to
all appearances not a native, approached me and, greeting me in the manner
customary there, addressed me in the following words:
" 'Doctor! You will perhaps do me the kindness to allow me to be your
companion on your morning walks? I have noticed that you always walk
alone in this area I am also very fond of walking here in the morning and as I
too am quite alone in Egypt, I venture to propose that I should accompany
you on these walks of yours. '
"Since the vibrations of his radiations in relation to mine did not seem
acutely 'otkalooparian' or, as your favorites would say in such a case, he
appeared to be 'congenial,' and since I myself had also thought of establishing
relations there with someone with whom, as a rest from 'active mentation,' I
could sometimes converse by following the course of freely flowing
associations, I at once agreed to his proposal and from that day forth spent the
time of my morning strolls with him.
"During our further acquaintance, it transpired that this foreigner was a
subject of the large community called 'Russia,' and that among his
compatriots he was an important 'power-possessing being.'



"In the course of our walks together it so happened, why I don't know, that
we began to talk chiefly about the weak will of three-brained beings and
about those weaknesses unworthy of them that they call 'vices' to which,
particularly in recent times, they accustom themselves very quickly, and
which finally become the sole basis for their existence, as well as for the
quality of their being-manifestations.
"Once during one of these conversations he suddenly turned to me and said " 'My dear Doctor' In my native land the passion for alcohol has greatly
increased in recent times and become widespread among people of all classes
And this passion, as you know, always leads sooner or later to those forms of
mutual relationship which in general, as history shows, bring about the
destruction of the age-old customs and attainments of society.
'This is why several farsighted compatriots of mine, having at last
understood the gravity of the situation that had arisen in our country, met
together in order perhaps to devise some means or other to prevent a
catastrophe For the realization of this task of theirs, they then and there
decided to found a society under the name of the "People's Temperance
League," and chose me to be the head of this enterprise.
'At the present time, the activities of the League in organizing measures
for the struggle against this national evil are in full swing.
" 'We have already done much and we intend to do much more. '
"Having said this, he thought for a moment and then continued,
" 'Now, my dear Doctor, if you were to ask my personal opinion as to the
results to be expected from this League of ours, speaking frankly, even
though I am at the head of it, I should be hard put to say anything good about
it.



'As regards the general state of affairs of our League, my only hope
personally is for a "stroke of luck."
'In my opinion, the whole trouble is that this League is under the
sponsorship of several groups upon which the accomplishment of its task
depends, but as each group follows its own particular aims and wishes, the
solution of each separate question related to the basic aim of the League al
ways produces controversy And thanks to this, instead of improving the
conditions for the speedy attainment of the fundamental aim of this
undertaking, so important for my dear country, the members of our League
only succeed in multiplying, day after day, all kinds of misunderstandings
between them—"personal issues," "gossip," "intrigues," "plots," and so on and
so forth.
" 'As for myself, I have recently thought so much, rethought, and consulted
with so many people who have had some experience of life, trying to find
some way out of this situation which has turned out so badly, that I nearly fell
ill and, at the insistence of those near me, was obliged to undertake this
journey to Egypt with the sole object of resting But alas! Even here in Egypt I
have been unable to rest because those same gloomy thoughts of mine give
me no peace .
'Well, my dear Doctor, now that you already know more or less the gist
of this matter, which is the cause of my present inner imbalance, I will frankly
confess the thoughts and hopes that have arisen in me in connection with our
acquaintance.
" 'The point is,' he continued, 'that during our long and frequent talks on the
subject of the pernicious vices of people and the possible measures for getting
rid of them, I became fully convinced both of your subtle understanding of the
psyche of people and of your great competence in creating conditions for the
struggle against their weaknesses And that is why I consider you the only man
who might be the



source of initiative for organizing and also for carrying out the activities of the League we have founded for the struggle against alcoholism. " 'Yesterday morning an idea came into my head and, after thinking it over all day and all evening, I finally decided to ask you this " 'Would you consent to go to my country, to Russia, and, after you have seen on the spot everything that is going on there, help us to organize this League of ours in such a way that it may really bring my country the benefits for which it was founded?'
"And he added: " 'Your impartial love of humanity gives me the courage to make this request and also assures me that you will not refuse to take part in a work that may save millions of people. "When this amiable elderly Russian finished speaking, I reflected for a moment and replied that I might very well accept his proposal to go to Russia, since that country could also be suitable for my chief aim. "And I went on to say 'At the present time I have but one aim, which is specifically to clear up for myself all the details of the manifestations of the human psyche, both in individuals taken separately and in their relations with one another in groups Now, for studying the state and manifestations of the psyche of large groups, Russia would perhaps be very suitable for me since, as I have understood from our talks, in your country this disease of the "passion for alcohol" has spread among almost the whole population, and consequently, I should have more opportunity to carry out my experiments on beings of various types, both individually and collectively. ' "After this talk with the important Russian being, I soon got ready, and in a few days we left Egypt together Two weeks later we were in the chief place of existence of



this large community, the city still called at that time 'St. Petersburg.'
"As soon as we arrived there, my new acquaintance devoted himself to his
own affairs which had greatly accumulated during his long absence.
"By that time, among other things, the large building constructed by the
League for the purpose of the struggle against alcoholism had already been
completed, and my new acquaintance immediately set to work to organize
and prepare everything necessary for what is called the 'inauguration' of that
building and for launching the activities connected with it.
"Meanwhile I began to go about everywhere, as was my usual habit, and to
meet the beings of this city belonging to various 'circles,' as they are called
there, in order to become acquainted with the characteristic particularities of
their manners and customs.
"Well, it was then that I observed, among other things, that in the presence
of the beings belonging to this contemporary community, their 'ego
individuality' was beginning to take a form that was distinctly dual.
"After I noticed this and began specially to investigate the question, I
finally discovered that this duality arose in their common presence chiefly
owing to a discordance between the 'tempo of the place of their arising and
existence' and the 'form of their being-mentation.'
"From my point of view, my boy, you will understand very well this
particularly sharp duality of the individuality of the beings of this large
community if I repeat to you word for word the opinion about them of our
esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin, which he gave me personally.
"I must tell you that during the second half of this last sojourn of mine
among your favorites, I happened more than once to meet that unique
terrestrial sage, Mullah Nasr



Eddin, and to have 'exchanges of opinion' with him on various 'life questions,' as is said there. "My personal meeting with him, during which he uttered that wise saying
of his defining the real essence of the beings of this large community, took
place on a part of your planet called 'Persia,' not far from a city named
'Isfahan,' where I had gone for my research concerning the most saintly ac
tivities of Ashiata Shiemash, and also to clear up on the spot the question of
how there first arose that maleficent form of so-called 'politeness' now
existing everywhere among them.
"Before my arrival in Isfahan, I knew that the esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin
had left for the town of 'Talayaltnikum' to stay with the stepson of the eldest
daughter of his godfather.
"As soon as I reached this latter town, I sought him out, and during the
whole time I was there I visited him frequently, and sitting on the roof, as was
the custom in this country, we would chat together about all kinds of 'subtle
philosophic questions.'
"One morning, on the second or third day after my arrival there, on my
way to see him my eye was caught by an unusual bustle in the streets,
everywhere people were sweeping, cleaning, and hanging up what are called
'carpets,' 'shawls,' 'flags,' and so on.
"I thought 'Evidently this is in preparation for one of the two celebrated
annual festivals of the beings of this community.
"Having ascended to the roof and exchanged the usual greetings with our
dear and most eminent sage, Mullah Nasr Eddin, I pointed toward what was
happening in the street and asked him what it was all about.
"Over his face spread his customary benevolent grimace which, though
enchanting as always, nevertheless had a



slight tinge of contempt, and he was about to say something, but at that moment the shouts of the town criers and the clatter of horses resounded in the street below. "Then our wise mullah, without a word, got up heavily and taking me by the sleeve led me to the edge of the roof and, giving me a knowing wink with his left eye, drew my attention to a large 'cavalcade' which was galloping by, consisting chiefly, as I later found out, of beings called 'Cossacks,' belonging to that large community of Russia. "In the center of this huge 'cavalcade,' a 'Russian phaeton' was rolling along, drawn by four horses and driven by a very fat and 'impressive' coachman His imposing exterior, quite Russian in manner, was due to the padding introduced in appropriate places under his clothes In this phaeton were seated two beings, one of them characteristic of that country of Persia and the other a typical 'Russian general.' "When this cavalcade had disappeared, the mullah first of all recited his favorite saying 'So and so and so must be, do not do what must not be,' and uttering his favorite exclamation, something like 'Zrrt!' he returned to his place and suggested that I do the same, then, having stirred the still smoldering charcoal in his 'kalyan,' he sighed deeply and launched into the following tirade which, as always, was not immediately comprehensible. 'Just now there passed by, escorted by a large number of "thoroughbred
turkeys," a "crow" of this country who although "important" and of high rank,
was nevertheless molting and badly rumpled.
"High-ranking crows" of this country, why I don't know, no longer take a single step without these "thoroughbred turkeys," evidently in the hope that perhaps the pitiable remains of their feathers, from being constantly exposed to the powerful radiations of these turkeys, may become a little stronger and stop falling out. '
"Although I understood positively nothing of what he



had just said, yet being familiar with his habit of expressing himself allegorically at first, I was not at all surprised and did not question him, but patiently awaited his further explanations. "And indeed, after he had delivered his tirade and had thoroughly finished 'hubble-bubbling' the water in his 'kalyan,' he gave me, with the 'subtle venom' proper to him, a definition of the whole presence and the very essence of the beings of the contemporary community of Persia and explained to me that he compared the Persian beings to the birds called 'crows,' while the beings of the large community of Russia who had formed the cortege that had galloped by, he compared to the birds called 'turkeys. '
"He developed this thought of his in a long dissertation: 'If we analyze impartially and sum up statistically the understanding and imagery prevalent among people of contemporary civilization, comparing the races that populate Europe with those of other continents, and draw an analogy between these races and birds, it may be said that the people who arise and exist on the continent of Europe and represent the very "tzimmes" of contemporary civilization must certainly be called "peacocks," that is, the bird with the most beautiful and gorgeous exterior, while the people dwelling on other continents must be called "crows," that is, the most good-for-nothing and dirty of all birds. 'But as for those contemporary people who find the basic conditions for their arising and formation on the continent of Europe, but whose subsequent life, and consequently further "stuffing," proceeds for some reason on other continents, and conversely for those of our contemporaries who appear on God's earth on some other continent and are further "stuffed" in the conditions prevailing in Europe, there is no better comparison than with the bird called "turkey. "
'This "turkey," more than any other bird, expresses that



"something" which is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring, but is
just, as is said, "a half and a quarter plus three-quarters. "
'The best representatives of these "turkeys" are the contemporary people
of Russia, and it was precisely such "turkeys" that surrounded one of the
chief "crows" of this country who just went dashing by.
'These Russians indeed correspond ideally to this original bird, as I will
show you.
'Arising and formed on the continent of Asia, and above all having a
pure heredity, both organic and psychic, forged in the course of many
centuries in the conditions of existence prevailing on this continent, they
possess, in all respects, the nature of Asiatic people, and in consequence they
too should be "crows " But since in recent times they have all been doing
their utmost to become Europeans and with this intent have been "stuffing"
themselves accordingly, they are little by little ceasing to be "crows", and
since, according to various undoubtedly lawful data, they cannot turn into real
"peacocks" and, having left the "crows" behind but having not yet caught up
with the "peacocks," they are in themselves, as I have said, ideal "turkeys."
" 'Although the turkey is very useful for the household because its meat is
better and more tasty than that of all other birds—of course, if it is killed in
the particular way that ancient peoples learned from long centuries of
practice— yet, in its living state, the turkey is indeed a strange bird and has a
certain very special psyche which is impossible, even approximately, to
understand, especially for our people with their half-passive minds.
'One of the many specific features of the psyche of this strange bird, the
turkey, is that he always finds it necessary to swagger, and thus without
rhyme or reason will often puff himself out.



" 'Even when no one is looking he struts and puffs himself out, and he does
this solely because of his own imagination and silly dreams. '
"Having said this, Mullah Nasr Eddin got up slowly and heavily, and again
pronouncing his favorite saying 'So and so this must be it,' but this time with
the ending 'don't sit long where you shouldn't sit,' he took me by the arm and
together we descended from the roof.
"Here, my dear boy, with all due respect to the subtle psychological analysis
of our most wise Mullah Nasr Eddin, it should in justice be said that if these
Russians have become such exemplary turkeys, once more the blame must be
placed solely on the beings of the community of Germany.
"And the beings of Germany were guilty in this case because, in inventing
the famous aniline dyes, they overlooked one of the specific peculiarities of
these colors.
"The point is that by means of these dyes it is possible to change into any
other color all natural colors except one, namely, genuine natural black.
"And it is through this lack of foresight on the part of the German beings
that the scandalous misfortune of the poor Russians came about, that is to say,
owing to the fact that the feathers of the 'crows' are dyed by nature, as it unex
pectedly turned out, Just a genuine black, then even with these aniline dyes
on account of their disgraceful imperfection—they can never be dyed any
other color, and so these poor 'Russian crows' cannot possibly become 'pea
cocks. ' And worst of all, having ceased to be 'crows' and not yet being
'peacocks,' they willy-nilly turn into 'turkeys,' which represent perfectly what
has been formulated by our dear teacher as 'a half and a quarter plus three
quarters.
"Well, thanks to the wise explanation that the esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin gave me himself, I understood clearly



for the first time why all the beings of that large community there, when they reach responsible age, possess such a sharply dual individuality.
"But enough about that Listen now to the events I happened to take part in after my arrival in the chief place of existence of the community of Russia, then called 'St Petersburg. ' "As I have already said, while my acquaintance, the said important Russian, straightened out his affairs, which had become disorganized during his absence, I began to go about everywhere and meet beings of all 'classes' and 'situations' in order to study the particularities of their manners and customs, and make clear for myself the cause of their so-called 'organic need' for alcohol and the manifest consequences of its effects on their common presence. "It is interesting to remark that during these meetings with three-brained beings belonging to various 'classes' and 'situations,' I noticed several times, and after more attentive observation it became quite evident to me, that the majority of them carried in themselves the germ of that 'particular functioning of their common presence' which for a long time has been arising in your favorites owing to a certain combination of two independent external causes. "The first of these causes is a common-cosmic law that exists under the name of 'Solioonensius', and the second is a marked deterioration in the conditions of ordinary being-existence on some part or other of the surface of this planet of yours. "I am speaking about that germ of the 'particular functioning of their common presence' which after several of their years was molded in all the beings of this community in a form that became, during certain definite periods, inherent in them, and was a 'stimulating factor' for the specific manifestations proper only to the three-brained beings of the planet Earth And this time the totality of these mani



festations among the beings of that large community was called 'Bolshevism "Later I will tell you about this 'particular functioning of their common presence.' "I touched upon this question at this point only to give you a picture of the extremely abnormal conditions of being-existence in which my activities proceeded during this sojourn of mine among the beings of this large community, in their capital city, St Petersburg. "Even before my arrival in that city, I had thought of carrying out one of my intentions, for which everything that was necessary had already been prepared. "The fact is that well before this I had intended to set up in one or another of their large populated places something similar to what they call a 'chemical laboratory' in which I wished to make special experiments, by means I had decided on beforehand, on certain deeply hidden aspects of their strange psyche. "And so, my boy, when I had settled down in this city and discovered that almost half my time there would be free, I decided to take advantage of being temporarily half-occupied, and set about fulfilling this intention of mine. "The results of my inquiries showed me that in order to set up such a laboratory it was required first of all to have a 'permit' from the local 'powerpossessing beings,' and that is why I immediately took steps to get this permit. "The first steps I took showed me that, on account of the laws which had long been fixed in the process of existence of this community, a permit to have one's own chemical laboratory could be issued only by a certain 'department' of one of their 'ministries,' as they are called. "And so I betook myself to that department, but it turned out that although the staff of this department acknowledged that it was their responsibility to issue this sort of permit, they themselves did not know how it was to be done.



"And as I later understood, they did not know this simply because no one had ever applied to them for such a permit, and consequently the automatically constructed psyche of these unfortunate beings had not acquired the 'mechanical habit' for the manifestation of a being-duty of this kind. "Here it must be noted that in general during recent centuries in the presence of all the beings on that planet, almost every manifestation for the fulfillment of their being-duty proceeds thanks exclusively to the functioning of data formed in them through frequent repetitions of one and the same thing. "Among the power-possessing beings of this community, the crystallization of certain peculiar automatic 'being-data' proceeded more intensely than anywhere else at this period, and was manifested so strongly that it sometimes even seemed as if data for the immediate engendering of impulses that are in general proper to beings were completely absent in them This crystallization proceeded in them, as I later made clear to myself, in consequence of the action of the cosmic law of Solioonensius, which I mentioned to you. "But as to the fact that nobody had applied for a permit to the staff of that department, this was by no means because none of the inhabitants of this chief place of their existence needed a 'chemical laboratory', on the contrary, never had there been so many chemical laboratories in that city as at that time, and doubtless all their owners had somehow or other procured the necessary permits from somewhere. "And indeed, how could they do without them' Was it not just for this that there existed in this city, as in all large and small communities, a certain 'administrative body,' on which rests the 'prime hope of complete bliss for power-possessors,' which they call the 'gendarmerie' or 'police,' and one of whose chief obligations is to see to it that everyone, for every kind of enterprise, should have a corresponding permit? Indeed, it must not be supposed that the



'lynx-eyed' representatives of the mentioned 'prime hope of complete bliss for
power-possessors' would let anything slip by and allow a laboratory to be set
up anywhere without the corresponding permit.
"The basic reason for this seeming contradiction was something quite
different.
"It is necessary to tell you that in this community the attitude toward the
laws and regulations established by beings in the past for 'normal'—according
to their understanding—mutual relationship and in general for ordinary
existence had become such that the only beings who could obtain the benefits
to which they had objective right were those who knew how to act to the
contrary, that is, against the laws and regulations there.
"Of these private laboratories, such as I wished to set up, not one but
thousands could be found there, it was merely necessary first of all to know
the 'abnormal ins and outs' needed for procuring the permits for these
laboratories and then to act in accordance with these abnormalities.
"But in the short time I had stayed there, I had not yet discovered all the
subtleties of the ordinary being-existence in this community which, as I said,
had become particularly abnormal.
"That is why, when I set out to take the first steps to get the permit I
required, there began for me those endless vexations or, as they themselves
say, those 'idiotic dilly-dallying' fixed long ago in the process of their being
existence, and besides, all this proved in the end to be quite fruitless.
"It began thus when I reached the aforesaid 'department' and addressed
myself to the staff there, they all began to eye each other with perplexity and
to whisper together, and several of them rummaged through fat tomes,
obviously in the hope of finding some written rule about the issuing of permits
Finally, the head of the department came toward



me and pompously told me that the first requirement was to bring him from
another department a document certifying my 'personal loyalty,' as they
express it.
"This was the beginning of endless perambulations, from one department
to another, from one administration to another, from one official specialist to
another . . . and so on without end.
"Things went so far that I was shuttled back and forth between the district
'police commissioner' and the 'parish priest'—all but to the official city
midwife.
"On top of all this, one of these 'departments,' why I don't know, required
that a certificate issued by another department should be stamped by a third.
"In one department I had to sign a certain paper, in another to answer
questions having nothing to do with chemistry, while in a third I was told
exactly how to handle the equipment of the laboratory so as not to be
poisoned, and so on and so forth.
"It turned out that, without suspecting it at the time, I had been in the
hands of an official among whose obligations was that of dissuading those
who wished to set up 'chemical laboratories' from this 'abominable intention '
"But the most ridiculous of all was that to get this permit it was necessary
to apply to one public servant after another, who had not even the remotest
notion of what a laboratory was.
"I do not know how all this would have ended if, having wasted almost
two months, I had not finally given up all this foolish bother.
"And I gave it all up for a reason that was not without its humor.
"According to the rules of this senseless procedure, I had to get an official
paper from a doctor certifying that my work in this laboratory would not
endanger my personal health.



"So I went to the official doctor But when he wished to examine me
thoroughly and asked me to undress completely so that he might tap me all
over with his little hammer, I could not, of course, consent And I could not
consent to this because, if I had bared myself, I should inevitably have
betrayed my tail which, on your planet, I skillfully hid under the folds of my
clothes.
"And you understand of course that if anyone had caught sight of it, soon
they would all have known that I was not a being of their planet, and I would
not have been able to remain among them and continue the experiments
which interested me for the elucidation of the strangeness of their psyche.
"That is why I left this doctor without the necessary paper and, from that
day on, I gave up the whole thing and ceased trying to obtain a permit to set
up my own laboratory.
"In spite of the fact that I had been going about everywhere pursuing my
special aim and running here and there to get this permit, I often met that
important Russian, my first acquaintance, who, although he was very busy
with his own affairs, found time to visit me or to receive me at his house.
"During these meetings we almost always talked about the alcoholism in
his country, and the measures for struggling against this evil.
"From each of these exchanges of opinion, more and more material was
accumulated in me, since my impartial observations and studies of all the
aspects of the psyche of the beings of that locality were constantly
crystallizing new data in me.
"This important Russian laid great weight on my considerations and
remarks on what had already been done by the 'People's Temperance League'
and on the plans for future activities, and was always sincerely delighted by
the justness of my observations.



"At first, all my suggestions, which he reported to the League at their general meetings, were always accepted and carried out. "But when certain members of this League accidentally learned that the initiative for many useful measures came from some foreign doctor or other, who was not even a European, all the habitual 'protest' and 'intrigue' rose up against the proposals coming from me, and also against the head of the League himself. "Those to blame for all the misunderstandings that led to the sorrowful end of such an important institution as the League, created for the welfare of the three-brained beings of this community of many millions were, as always and in everything, the 'learned beings of new formation. ' "The point is that, on the insistence of certain hereditary 'power-possessing beings,' there were included among the permanent leading members of this new institution several 'learned physicians.' "They happened to be among the leaders of this League because in the presences of the hereditary power-possessors of that period there had become definitely fixed, as an integral part of their essence, that same 'inner overlord' of theirs, so maleficent for terrestrial three-brained beings, which of itself had become the sense and aim of existence for those unfortunates, and was called by them 'self-calming ' And therefore, to spare themselves the least beingeffort, they insisted that these learned physicians should without fail be included in this important institution of great social significance. "In recent times, for some reason or other, the members of that very
profession become learned beings of new formation.
"It is further necessary to tell you that when certain of these learned beings of new formation become 'power-possessors' and happen to take up important responsible



posts in the process of ordinary existence, they serve as sources of every kind of misunderstanding much more often than the hereditary power-possessing beings. "And they serve as sources of misunderstanding obviously because in their common presence there are acquired— and interwoven in a particular waythe characteristics of three quite different contemporary types of your favorites, namely, 'power-possessing beings,' 'learned beings of new formation,' and 'professional physicians. ' "And so, my boy, on the initiative and insistence of several hereditary power-possessing beings of that community— especially of those who, while outwardly still possessing power, had no more inner significance than 'empty hourglasses' or 'deflated gasbags'—the accomplishment of such a serious task as the relative 'saving' of many millions of beings similar to themselves was entrusted to those 'genuine stuffed turkeys' or, as they would say there, 'upstarts. ' "At first, as long as these upstarts who had accidentally been brought to power carried on the petty intrigues proper to them just among themselves, it was still only 'half a calamity' for the common undertaking, but when, thanks to all kinds of 'maneuverings,' intrigues began between all the members of the League, and they broke up into different 'factions'—a pernicious custom which is very widespread there and obstructs the actualization of every promising beginning—then even such a good beginning as this League, founded for the general welfare of contemporary three-brained beings, began, as they say, 'to crack at the seams. "Just when I arrived with my first Russian acquaintance in the chief place of existence of this community, these petty intrigues of theirs were 'in full swing' between the different factions, as well as between the separate members of that indispensable state organization. "When those upstarts who had accidentally been given power learned that many of the counsels and indications for



improving the organization came from me, a professional like themselves but
one who did not belong to their so-called 'corporation,' they realized that their
intrigues and mudslinging could have no significance whatever for me, and
directed them against the head of the League, whom they themselves had
chosen.
"It is appropriate to remark here, incidentally, that although every kind of
data for evoking the various being-impulses which they ought to have are in
general feebly crystallized in the presences of these contemporary profes
sionals there, the data which bring forth the impulse called 'corporate feeling'
for some reason or other are crystallized and function in them very strongly.
"Well, my boy, as long as I did not know that to be occupied with intrigues
and mudslinging or, as they sometimes express it, 'cutting each other's
throats,' is a compelling need in power-possessing beings of this community, I
continued to hope, and patiently awaited suitable conditions for the possibility
of achieving my fundamental aim, that is, of proceeding with my observations
and experiments on the psyche of the terrestrial beings en masse But when it
became definitely clear to me that in this community under the existing
conditions of reciprocal relationships I could never succeed in this, and I also
became convinced that it was impossible to get my own chemical laboratory
there by honest means, that is, strictly in conformity with the laws of this
community, I decided to remain there no longer but to depart and seek
suitable conditions for my aim in some other European community.
"When my first acquaintance, the influential Russian, learned about this
decision of mine he was greatly grieved, as were also several other Russian
beings who were really concerned for the welfare of their native land, and
who during this period had had time to become convinced that



my knowledge and experience might be very useful for their fundamental aim.
"Several days before I was to leave, the League was preparing for the
opening of the big building designed, as I have already told you, as the
headquarters for the struggle against alcoholism, and which the beings there
called by the name of their tsar, the 'National Building of Tsar Nicholas II. '
"On the eve of my intended departure, my important Russian acquaintance
came to see me unexpectedly and, having expressed his sincere regret at my
leaving, begged me very earnestly to stay a few days longer so that after the
dedication and opening of this building he might travel with me and
incidentally rest a little from all the recent worries and intrigues.
"I had no special reason to hurry, so I agreed, and postponed my departure
for an indefinite time.
"Two days later the inauguration of this building took place and, as I had
received what is called an 'official invitation' the previous evening, I betook
myself to the ceremony.
"Well, at this state solemnity of that contemporary community of many
millions of people, which even His Majesty the Tsar attended, there began to
flow in respect of my person what is called 'ooretstaknilkarool,' which
generally speaking always flows from the totality of the surrounding
abnormalities and, forming automatically in the psyche of every one of the
three-brained beings of that ill-starred planet, holds them all, as it were, in an
'exitless magic circle. '
"And the further events proceeded in the following order:
"On the day of this state solemnity, while the ceremony was still in
progress, my first Russian acquaintance suddenly ran toward me, pushing his
way through the beings who



were exhibiting themselves in all the blaze of what are called 'full-dress uniforms and decorations,' and in a joyous voice announced to me that I was to have the 'happiness' of being presented to His Majesty the Tsar, and having said this rapidly he hurried away. "It turned out that at this solemnity he had had some conversation with the tsar about me, as a result of which it had been decided that I should be presented to him. "To be presented to an 'emperor,' 'tsar,' or 'king' is considered on all the continents of that planet as a very, very great piece of luck, and that is why my acquaintance rejoiced beyond words at receiving such a favor on my behalf. "Obviously he wished to give me 'great pleasure' by this presentation, and thereby calm his own conscience, since he considered himself to blame for my unsuccessful stay in this capital.
"After this event, two days passed. "On the third morning, happening to glance out of the window of my lodging into the street, I saw quite an unusual commotion everywhere people were cleaning and sweeping, and numerous 'policemen' and 'officers' were walking up and down the street. "To my question as to what caused all this, our Ahoon explained to me that
on that day, in our street, a very important general was expected.
"On the same day, in the afternoon, while I was sitting at home and talking
with one of my new acquaintances, the concierge of the house came running
in to me, agitated and flustered and, in a stammering voice, announced 'His
Ex . . . Exce . . . cel . . . lency!' But he did not have time to finish before His
Excellency himself entered.
"As soon as the unfortunate concierge saw him appear, he was struck dumb as if by lightning, and then, pulling himself together, he backed hurriedly out of the room.



"His Noble Excellency himself, with a friendly smile, though with a shade of what is called 'hauteur,' characteristic of the power-possessing beings of that community, came toward me, at the same time inspecting with great curiosity the antiques that were in my room and, shaking my hand in a special way by the wrist, he sat down in my favorite armchair.
"Afterward, continuing to eye the antiques, he said: 'In a day or two you will be presented to His August Majesty, and since it is I who attend to these affairs, I have come to explain to you what you must do and how you must behave on such a great and important occasion of your life. ' "Having said this, he suddenly stood up and went over to a porcelain
figure of ancient Chinese workmanship which stood in a corner of my room,
exclaiming with impulsive rapture that thrilled his whole presence. 'How
charming! . . Where did you get this marvel of ancient wisdom . .?'
"And without taking his eyes off this figure and, giving himself up to his rapture or, more strictly speaking, with all his feelings coursing through him, he continued: " 'I am very much interested myself in all ancient art, but chiefly in the
Chinese, and that is why, of the five rooms set aside for my collection, three
are filled solely with ancient Chinese works.'
"Continuing to speak in this strain about his adoration for the works of
ancient Chinese masters, he unceremoniously sat himself down again in my
armchair and began to enlarge upon antiques in general, their value, and
where they are to be found.
"All at once, in the middle of this conversation, he hastily took his watch
from his pocket, automatically glanced at it, sprang to his feet, and
exclaimed:
" 'How vexing! I am obliged to interrupt our extremely interesting chat, as I must hurry home where a great friend



of my youth and his charming wife are doubtless already waiting for me.
" 'He is here for a short while from the provinces, passing through on his
way abroad, and I have not seen him since we served in the same regiment
and received different appointments, I to the Court and he to a civil post. '
"And he added: " 'As regards the instructions I am required to give you, and which was the
object of my visit, I will send my adjutant this very day, and he will explain
everything to you, and no worse perhaps than I would.
"Whereupon, with fussy self-importance, he took his leave.
"And indeed, on the evening of the very same day, as His Noble
Excellency had promised me, one of his adjutants came to my house This
adjutant of his was still, as is said there, a 'young man,' that is, a being who
had only just attained responsible age, with all the traits of that specific type
of terrestrial three-brained being one often comes across in recent times
among your favorites, defined by the words, 'mama's and papa's darling. '
"When he first arrived and began to speak to me, this 'mama's darling'
manifested himself toward me quite automatically, according to the data fixed
in his common presence by the rules of what is called 'bon ton' that had been
hammered into him But a little later, when it became clear to his strange
being-comprehension that I belonged neither to his own caste nor to a higher
one, and appeared to be one of those who, according to the abnormal
understanding of the beings of that community, are considered little better
than what are called 'savages,' he at once changed his tone and, still
automatically, began to manifest himself toward me according to the data for
'commanding and ordering about'—data fixed in the common presence of the
beings belonging to that caste—and he undertook to point out how



I must enter, leave, and move, and when to speak, and in what words. "Not only for two full hours did he show me by his own example how to
conduct myself, but he then announced that he would return on the morrow,
and he ordered me to practice so that, as he expressed it, 'no
misunderstanding would arise' which might lead to 'where even Makar did
not drive his goats.'
"On the day of my 'supreme presentation,' as they call it, I arrived at the
place where the chief of this large community had his residence, and was met
at the railway station by His Excellency in person, attended by a half dozen of
his adjutants, and from that moment—of course quite without the
participation of his 'personal subjective initiative,' but guided only by
automatic habit, acquired thanks to doing always one and the same thing—he
began to subjugate all the separate spiritualized parts and the manifestations
of my common presence, taking it all, as it were, under the directive of his
own 'I.'
"From that moment, as far as my outer manifestations were concerned, I was obliged, as our esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin would say, 'to dance to his tune. ' "No sooner were we seated in the carriage and driving away from the
station than he started showing me and prompting me as to how I must act
and speak and what I must not do or say.
"And later, in the hall where the celebrated presentation took place, when
he further instructed me and directed my presence this can neither be
spoken of in the language of a Scheherazade, nor described with the pen of a
'Mr Canineson.'
"In that hall every step I took, every movement I made, even the blinking
of my eyelids, was foreseen and 'prompted' by this important general.
"However, in spite of all the absurdity of this procedure,



if one takes into account that the perfecting of a being depends on the quality
and quantity of his inner experiences, then objective justice demands that your
favorites be given their due for this: on that day, of course unconsciously, they
compelled me to undergo and to feel perhaps more than I had undergone and
felt during all the centuries of my personal sojourns among them.
"However that may be, although I had agreed to this famous presentation
in order to observe and study that peculiar and 'contorted' psyche of your
favorites, I must say that, after the ordeal I had just lived through, I was able
to breathe freely only in the train, after my tormentors, particularly that lordly
general, had finally left me to myself.
"During that entire day, I was so occupied with the fulfillment of all the
innumerable foolish manipulations required of me, which were fatiguing in
view of my advancing years, that I did not even notice what the unfortunate
tsar looked like or how he conducted himself in this comedy.
"Now, my boy, if you will strive to assimilate thoroughly the information
about the events that happened to me as a consequence of this 'famous
presentation to His Majesty the Tsar,' you will probably be able to picture to
yourself and understand how, for most of your favorites, particularly in the
large community of Russia at that time, what is called their 'individual
significance' began to be appraised and established exclusively on the basis of
ephemeral outer 'vietroooretznel,' as occurred to me in this case.
"This habit of judging the merits of other beings according to ephemeral
outer appearance gradually took root in them, and continued to grow and
reinforce their illusion that the acquisition of 'being-individuality' depends
solely on this outer appearance; and all of them, subjectively, began to strive
only for that.
"This is why at the present time all of them, from the moment of their
arising, gradually lose the 'taste' of and



even the 'desire' for what is called 'objective-being Being.' "The manifestations of the aforementioned vietroooretznel in relation to
my person began, on the very next morning, to have their action, in the sense
that all the data for being-notions about my personality, which had previously
been firmly fixed in the presences of beings who knew me, changed abruptly
for no other reason than this objectively maleficent 'official presentation' of
mine to their highest 'power-possessing being '
"Their notions about my personal significance, as well as about all my
qualities and merits, were suddenly transformed for their individuality, for all
of them I suddenly became 'important,' 'wise,' 'extraordinary,' 'interesting,' and
so on and so forth, that is, the possessor of all kinds of fantastic being
qualities of their own invention.
"To illustrate what I have just said, the following characteristic examples
may serve.
"The proprietor of the shop where I usually bought the provisions for my
kitchen before attending to my business insisted, the first morning after this
'royal audience' of mine, on bringing the purchases to my house himself. All
the policemen standing at the street corners in the district where I was living,
who already knew me as a foreign physician, began saluting at the sight of me
even while still some way off, just as if I were one of their most important
generals.
"The same evening the chief of the department where I had first applied
personally brought to my house that miserable permit giving me the right to
have my own laboratory, for which I had languished for three months on the
doorsteps of every kind of 'official' and 'unofficial' establishment. And on the
next day I received four more permits for the same purpose from various
departments of other ministries that had no authority at all to issue such
permits but where, on account of this dilly-dallying of theirs, I had applied
during my senseless perambulations.



"The house owners, shopkeepers, children, and in general everyone in my
street became as amiable toward me as if I were intending to leave each of
them a 'large American legacy ' And so on and so forth
"After this 'emptycranian' event, I learned, by the way, that this unfortunate
tsar also always has to prepare himself for such official meetings with beings
who are strangers to him.
"And he has many of these official meetings almost every day and even
several times a day here a parade of the troops, there an audience with the
ambassador of some other ruler, in the morning, a delegation, at noon, a
presentation such as mine, later, a reception of different 'representatives of the
people,' as they are called, and in each case it is necessary for him to talk, or
even to deliver a full-scale speech.
"As the least word of such a terrestrial tsar can have and often does have
serious consequences, not only for the beings of the community he rules but
also for those of other communities, each word must be thought out from
every aspect.
"Well, for this purpose, surrounding these tsars or emperors, who occupy
their throne by hereditary right or by election, are many specialists chosen
from the ordinary three-brained beings there, who 'prompt' them in what they
must do and say on all occasions, and these promptings and directions must be
given in such a way that people do not notice that their emperor manifests not
on his own initiative but on the initiative of others.
"And in order to remember all this, these emperors must of course also
practice.
"And what it means to practice you can probably picture to yourself after
what I have just told you I understood this with all my being when I prepared
myself for my illustrious presentation.
"During my entire existence on that planet, by the way, such a preparation was necessary for me only once. Were



preparations of this sort necessary every day and for every separate occasion . . . one could only wish to be spared such a merciless fate! "I personally, at least, would not under any conditions wish to be in the skin of such a terrestrial emperor or tsar, and would wish it neither for my worst enemy nor for the enemies of my closest kin.
"Soon after this unforgettable 'supreme presentation' of mine I left St Petersburg, and thereafter the chief places of my existence were various cities on the continent of Europe as well as on other continents Later, but for other affairs, I often returned to the community of Russia, where during that period of the flow of time their 'great process of reciprocal destruction' and the 'annihilation of everything already attained by them' was taking place—a process which this time, as I told you, they called 'Bolshevism. ' "You remember, I promised to tell you about the real fundamental causes of this arch-phenomenal process. "Well then, as I have already mentioned, this grievous phenomenon arises there as a result of two independent factors, the first being the cosmic law of Solioonensius, and the second, as always, those same abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence established by them themselves. "In order that you should understand better both these factors, I will explain to you each of them separately, and will begin with the cosmic law of Solioonensius. "First of all you must be told that all the three-brained beings, on whatever planet they arise and whatever exterior coating they receive, always await the manifestations of the action of this law with impatience and joy, somewhat as your favorites look forward to their feasts of 'Easter,' 'Bairam,' 'Zadik,' 'Ramadan,' 'Kaialana,' and others. "The only difference is that your favorites look forward to these feasts of theirs with impatience because on these



'holy days' it has become customary for them to abandon themselves to
merrymaking and drunkenness, whereas the beings of other planets await the
action of Solioonensius with impatience because thanks to it the need for
evolving, in the sense of acquiring Objective Reason, increases in them by
itself.
"As for the causes that give rise to the action of this cosmic law, they are
different for each planet, but always flow from and depend upon what is
called the 'common-cosmic harmonious movement', and as regards your
planet Earth, what is called the 'center of gravity of causes' is brought about by
the 'periodic tension' of the sun of its system, brought about in its turn by the
influence upon this sun of a neighboring solar system, existing under the name
of 'Baleaooto.'
"In this latter system, however, the 'center of gravity of causes' is
determined by the presence, among the number of its concentrations, of a
great comet, 'Solni,' which, in accordance with certain combinations of the
'common-cosmic harmonious movement,' comes at times in its falling very
near to its sun Baleaooto, which is thereby forced greatly to increase its
'tension' in order to maintain the path of its own falling This tension provokes
the same in the suns of the neighboring systems, among which is the system
Ors, and when in its turn the sun Ors increases its tension in order not to
change the path of falling proper to it, it provokes the same tension in all the
concentrations of its own system, among which is also the planet Earth.
"The 'tension' in each of the planets acts also on the common presence of
all the beings arising and breeding on it, always engendering in the beings,
besides desires and intentions of which they are not aware, the feeling called
sacred 'iabolioonozor' or, as your favorites would say, 'religious feeling,'
namely, that 'being-feeling' which, as I have already said, appears at times in
the desire and striving for more rapid self-perfecting as regards Objective
Reason.



"It is interesting that when this sacred feeling—or another similar to it, likewise engendered by a certain common-cosmic actualization—is produced in the presence of your favorites, they accept it as a symptom of one of their numerous diseases, and call it 'nerves.' "It is necessary to remark that this impulse, inherent in the presence of all three-brained beings of our Great Universe, arose and was developed almost normally in most of the terrestrial beings of a former period, that is, from the time when the organ kundabuffer was removed from their common presence right up to the second transapalnian perturbation. "But later, among the chief evils flowing from the conditions of ordinary being-existence established by them themselves, especially since there began to predominate in the presence of every terrestrial three-brained being their 'inner evil god' named 'self-calming,' it came about that under the action of Solioonensius, instead of the desire and striving for a more rapid selfperfecting, a 'something' began to arise in them which they themselves characterize by the words 'need of freedom,' which is the chief cause of the appearance of these grievous processes of theirs such as this recent 'Bolshevism. ' "I will explain somewhat later how they represent to themselves this famous 'freedom' of theirs, for the moment I will only tell you that the sensation which arises from the action of Solioonensius strengthens the need in them for some change or other in the general outer conditions of their ordinary being-existence, which until then were more or less stable. "After the second transapalnian perturbation occurred to this ill-starred planet, that is, after the 'loss of Atlantis,' the action of the cosmic law of Solioonensius in the common presence of your favorites took place at least forty times, and each time, thanks to this strange need of freedom which



has become fixed in the majority of them, almost the same thing took place as
has recently been occurring among the groups inhabiting that part of the
surface of your planet called 'Russia. '
"Here it is extremely important to note that these terrifying processes could
never have occurred among the three-brained beings of the planet Earth if
those data for engendering the being-impulse of Conscience, which had
remained intact in their subconscious—data to which the Most Saintly Ashiata
Shiemash was the first to turn his attention, and which he relied upon for the
fulfillment of his mission—had taken part in the functioning of that con
sciousness of theirs which has become habitual for them during their waking
state.
"It is only because the data for the sacred impulse of being-Conscience do
not take part in the functioning of this consciousness of theirs that the action
of the law of Solioonensius, as well as of other inevitable cosmic laws, as
sumes these abnormal forms which are so lamentable for them.
"As regards the second factor, although all the causes serving together as the
source of its arising were, as I have said, the abnormal conditions of their
ordinary being-existence, in my opinion the basic cause is their famous
subdivision into 'castes,' which has become established for their mutual re
lationships and has existed there uninterruptedly, except in the period when
the results of the most saintly labors of Ashiata Shiemash had definitely taken
root in them.
"The only difference is that in former centuries the division into different
castes proceeded from the consciousness and initiative of certain independent
individuals there, whereas now this proceeds quite automatically without the
participation of the will or consciousness of anyone.
"Now, my boy, I find it opportune to explain to you



briefly in what way and in what progression these favorites of yours became automatically sorted out into their different celebrated 'classes,' and also how later they began by themselves to subdivide into 'castes. ' "Whenever, through various chance circumstances, a substantial group of your favorites concentrates somewhere in order to exist together, certain of them in whom for some reason or other the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer have already been thoroughly crystallized—which gives to their common presence the impulse for what is called 'cunning'—and in whose hands there are at that time many different what are called 'means of intimidation,' or what they themselves call 'weapons,' soon set themselves apart from the other beings and, putting themselves at their head, constitute the beginnings of what is called the 'ruling class.' "And further, since in all three-brained beings of the planet Earth, particularly of recent periods, the sacred being-impulse called 'Conscience' takes no part in the functioning of their ordinary consciousness—as a result of which they lack even the desire to make any conscious being-effort at allthe beings who have thus set themselves apart as the ruling class, making use of these 'means of intimidation,' compel the other beings of the given group to produce for them even those efforts which every being should without fail make for himself in his ordinary being-existence. "And the other beings of the group, also for the same reasons, not wishing
to produce these being-efforts themselves, least of all for others, and at the
same time fearing the means of intimidation of the beings of the ruling class,
begin to resort to all kinds of cunning in order to unload 'onto their neighbor's
back' the being-efforts inevitably required by the ruling class.
"The usual result is that the beings of every such group gradually sort themselves out and fall into different cate



gories according to the degree of their artfulness And it is precisely their
division into categories of this kind that leads to further subdivision in
subsequent generations, and the assignment of one another into these famous
'castes' of theirs.
"This relegating of one another to castes of different kinds infallibly
crystallizes in the common presence of each of them toward the beings
belonging to other castes the being-data for what is called 'hatred,' just those
data which are never found in any other beings in the whole of our Great Uni
verse, and which in turn invariably engender in the common presence of all
your favorites those impulses 'shameful' for three-brained beings, which they
call 'envy,' 'jealousy,' 'adultery,' and many others of the same sort.
"And so, my boy, these terrifying processes of reciprocal destruction and
of the annihilation of everything they have attained ensue partly from the
following cause in certain periods, when the action of the cosmic law of
Solioonensius makes itself felt in their common presence, arousing in them
the mentioned need for 'freedom,' then on the one hand, the intensity of action
of the data already inherent in them for constantly engendering the impulse of
'timidity' in front of power-possessors automatically diminishes, while on the
other hand, the intensity of action of those strange being-data provoking
'hatred' toward beings of other castes increases.
"That is why I said that this subdivision of your favorites into castes
bringing about in its total result these uniquely strange being-data which
manifest more and more in their functioning and which flow, as you have
doubtless been convinced by everything I have told you, from the conditions
of their abnormal ordinary being-existence—serves chiefly as the second
factor for the arising of these terrifying processes.



"These terrible processes usually arise and flow in the following sequence:
"It always begins like this Under the influence of the action of
Solioonensius, several beings from one or another group in whom data for
engendering that strange impulse toward beings of other castes, particularly
those of the ruling class, happen to have been crystallized more strongly than
in the rest—see and feel reality more than the others and begin, as is said
there, to 'clamor,' and these 'clamoring orators' become for those around them
what at the present time are usually called 'leaders.'
"And further, thanks both to this 'clamoring' and to the action of the
cosmic law of Solioonensius, which always combine abnormally in their
presences, others in their turn begin to clamor.
"When this uproar among the ordinary beings begins to act too
cacophonously upon what are called the 'effeminate nerves of the left half of
certain power-possessing beings of the community, and these latter give
orders to those whose jobs it is to grease with what is called 'Scottish cream'
the navels of several particularly vociferous clamorers, it is then that these
excesses of theirs begin and rise progressively to a climax—yet in the end, to
the misfortune of your favorites, they always lead to nothing.
"If these processes of theirs had improved the existence of beings of
subsequent generations even a little, then perhaps from the point of view of a
strictly impartial observer they might not appear to be so terrible But to the
misfortune of all the three-brained beings of our Great Universe, no sooner
does the 'blissful action' of this lawful cosmic manifestation cease, and these
terrifying processes come to an end, than there begins again the 'same old
story,' and ordinary being-existence grows more bitter than before and,
parallel with this, there also deteriorates what is called the 'sane awareness of
the sense and aim of their existence. '



"And it deteriorates, in my opinion, chiefly because after these processes,
the leaders of the former ruling class are usually replaced by beings from
other castes which have never had among their representatives, either of the
present or past generations, persons of any experience, conscious or
unconscious, of that being-manifestation which gives the ability to direct the
process of outer existence, and sometimes even of inner existence, of
surrounding beings who although 'similar' to them have not yet attained to
their degree of Reason.
"In all justice it must be admitted that although in the common presence of
the three-brained beings of the former ruling class the data present in their
'subconscious' for engendering real being-Conscience also did not take part in
the functioning of their 'waking consciousness,' these beings at least did have
the habit of ruling, acquired by heredity and improving automatically from
generation to generation.
"On the other hand, in the presence of the beings who have newly attained
to power, not only is real being-Conscience absent, as in the beings of the
former ruling class, but in addition, certain 'charms' begin to manifest in a
particularly stormy way and to give extraordinary and terrible results These
'charms' in general are crystallized in the presence of terrestrial three-brained
beings, especially of recent times, in consequence of the properties of the
organ kundabuffer, such as 'vanity,' 'pride,' 'self-conceit,' 'self-love,' and
others, whose functioning in them is still quite fresh, having almost never
before been 'satisfied' to a sufficient degree.
"To these terrestrial beings who become 'impromptu power-possessors,'
with no hereditary data at all in themselves for even the automatic ability to
rule, one of the sayings of our dear teacher can be fittingly applied
" 'I have yet to meet that idiot used to shuffling about in



a pair of old slippers who would feel comfortable in smart new shoes.
"And really, my boy, each time the action of Solioonensius comes to an
end and a 'relatively normal' existence begins again among your favorites, the
'freshly baked' power-possessing beings 'cut those capers' thanks to which
there is a constant increase in the birth rate of what are called 'slugs,' 'snails,'
'lice,' 'cockroaches,' and many similar parasites which destroy everything
good on that planet.
"As I have begun to speak about Bolshevism, in order to give you still another
example of the strangeness of the being-mentation of your favorites that has
become proper to them, I shall tell you about one of their naive rationali
zations which is not without its humor.
"This naïveté of theirs, which arises from their excessively poor
confrontative being-judgment, consists in this, that although during the last
two centuries all events there, without exception, in the sphere of their mutual
relationships occurred entirely automatically, without the participation of the
consciousness or intention of any contemporary being, nevertheless they do
not hesitate to ascribe, even with envy, all the good or bad results flowing
from these events to one or another of their fellow beings.
"And this abnormality which has become fixed in the entirety of their spiritualized parts is due to the following causes. "First of all, there have gradually disappeared from their common presence
all those being-data, the totality of which can engender in beings the property
called 'prescience,' and thus they are entirely deprived of the possibility of
foreseeing imminent events in any degree whatsoever, second, having a
'narrow horizon' and a 'short memory,' they not only know nothing about
long-past events on their planet, but



even do not remember what happened quite recently, even yesterday, and
third, they have no knowledge of the cosmic laws thanks chiefly to which
there arise those sorrowful events that proceed among them So these
contemporary favorites of yours are convinced with all their presence that this
is the first time that the terrible process they call 'Bolshevism' has broken out
on their planet and that nothing like it had ever existed before that 'darling
civilization of theirs', and they are even sure that it happened owing to the
'progressive evolution' of the Reason of beings like themselves.
"Their reasoning on the subject of similar processes which have taken
place many times in the past on their planet may serve as a good example to
illustrate and characterize the phenomenal stupidity and rigidity of their being
judgment.
"The simple common sense of every three-brained being would indicate
that such processes were bound to take place, and ever since I became
interested in the strange psyche of these favorites of yours and began to
occupy myself with observing them in every aspect, I myself have been a
witness no less than forty times of exactly similar processes, which I would
call the 'destruction of everything within sight. '
"It is interesting to note that almost half of all these terrifying processes
occurred not far from the place where what they call their 'cultured existence'
is now concentrated, that is, they took place on that part of the surface of their
planet named 'Egypt. '
"These terrible processes occurred so often in Egypt because, in the course
of long periods of time, this part of the surface of your planet has occupied, in
relation to the 'common-cosmic harmonious movement,' the position of 'center
of gravity of radiations. ' And that is why the influence of the cosmic law of
Solioonensius often acted on the presence of the three-brained beings breeding
there, each time bringing forth in them this abnormality.



"If we compare the authentic data about the events that took place in Egypt
with the data on this subject fixed in the being-representation and
understanding of almost every responsible being of their famous
contemporary 'culture'— data which they discovered, as it were, thanks to
their 'already perfected Reason'—we will have an obvious example of the kind
of data on which their 'logical mentation' is built during their responsible
existence Besides, this would allow me to note and stress once more all the
maleficence, in an objective sense, of that practice firmly established in the
process of their ordinary existence, which they dignify by the high-sounding
words of 'education' and 'schooling' of the growing generation.
"The fact is that among the many kinds of ephemeral, fantastic
information, which taken as a whole forms that strange Reason, proper to
them alone, the history of this Egypt likewise has its place .
"This fantastic 'history,' evidently thought up by some candidate or other
for becoming a 'hasnamuss individual,' was even made an 'obligatory subject'
in all their educational establishments, where this history, among other similar
stupidities, is 'hammered' into their separate concentrations for the functioning
of spiritual perceptions and manifestations, or into what they would call the
'brains' of these future responsible beings, and furthermore, when these
unfortunates do become 'responsible beings,' all this fantastic information,
learned parrotlike under compulsion, serves them as the basis for being
associations and 'logical confrontative mentation.'
"And so today, my boy, on that ill-fated planet every being of responsible
age, instead of having the real knowledge which a normal three-brained being
should possess concerning the events that took place on their planet in the
past, knows about everything in that same way in which he



unconsciously assimilates with his whole being 'information' about this Egypt and speculates about it with his being-Reason. "There's no gainsaying it thanks to their system of 'education' and 'schooling,' each of the so-called 'responsible' three-brained beings of this strange planet already knows the history of the beings who existed long ago in Egypt. "Yet the way he knows it, that is, by means of taking in information 'like a parrot,' and what totality of being-representations result from this in all three of his spiritualized parts, you may picture to yourself and clearly understand from the following illustration of mine. "Almost every one of them 'knows' that the ancient Egyptians had twenty
four dynasties. But if any one of them is asked 'Why were there so many
dynasties there?' it would appear that he had never even thought about it.
"And if anyone insists on an answer, this same being, who up till now 'knew' and was sure with all his presence that there were twenty-four dynasties among the ancient Egyptians, would at best—provided of course that someone helps him to be sincere and to express aloud the associations flowing in him—reveal his logical mentation in some such way as this
'These Egyptians had twenty-four dynasties. " 'Well . . . This proves that a monarchical state organization existed among
the Egyptians and that the position of "king" passed by inheritance from father
to son. Now it was customary for kings of the same lineage to have the same
family name and for all the kings of that name to compose one dynasty.
Therefore there were as many dynasties of kings as there were family names
"Very understandable, and as clear as a patch on the baggy trousers of the honorable Mullah Nasr Eddin.
"And if any of the beings of contemporary culture really



longs to know why the family names of these ancient Egyptian kings changed so often, and makes a great effort to explain this to his Reason, his beingmentation at best will again associate somewhat in the following sequence. 'Evidently in olden times it often happened that in this Egypt the "kings" or, as they were called there, "pharaohs," grew tired of reigning and abdicated their power to another—and very likely this proceeded in the following way and under the following circumstances. " 'Let us suppose that some pharaoh or other named John Geoffrey lived peacefully and with full satisfaction, and ruled over all the Egyptians. " 'Well, it once happened that this same King or Pharaoh John Geoffrey felt a very great weariness from all this reigning of his and, one sleepless night, pondering over his "kingly position," he realized for the first time with all his being that, willy-nilly, a man grows tired of reigning, and that this occupation is, in general, an extremely "trying job" and from his personal point of view could not be said to be either useful or safe. 'Pharaoh John Geoffrey became impressed by this realization and, profiting by the experience acquired in his past existence, decided to try and find a way to "prevail upon" somebody or other to deliver him from this weariness, so undesirable for him. " 'To this end he probably invited some other, still ordinary, John Geoffrey to come to him, and very politely addressed him, more or less as follows: "My highly honorable and incomparably kind John Geoffrey, I frankly confess to you, as to the only friend and subject worthy of my trust, that this kingdom over which I rule has grown too tiresome for me and this has happened perhaps because I have become extremely weary.
" ' "Speaking between ourselves, as regards my dear son



and heir to whom I might now hand over the kingdom, although he appears to
be very strong and healthy, he is, in fact, neither one nor the other.
" ' "You, as a father known for his love of his posterity, will surely
understand if I tell you that I love my son and heir greatly, and I would not
like him to reign and get as tired as I am, so I have just decided to propose
that you, as a faithful subject and personal friend, should deliver me and my
son from reigning and take this high obligation upon yourself."
" 'And since this still ordinary John Geoffrey was evidently, as is said
there, a "good sport," and on the other hand a rascal full of "vanity," he
shrugged his shoulders and said, with tears in his eyes, "I might as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb," and agreed, and from the very next day he
began to reign.
'As the family name of this other John Geoffrey was different, on the
very next day the number of Egyptian dynasties was increased by one.
" 'Now, as many pharaohs of this Egypt often grew tired and, loving their
sons, desired to spare them such a fate, they renounced their kingdoms in this
way in favor of others, and that is why the number of dynasties mounted up
there.
"In reality, however, the changes of dynasty in Egypt did not proceed so
simply, and in the intervals between dynasties such perturbations took place
there that in comparison with them contemporary Bolshevism is merely
'child's play.'
"More than once, in the heat of this contemporary Bolshevism, I happened
to witness how several beings who for reasons of course independent of them
personally had not taken part in this process—and so could half-consciously
observe it from outside—grew sincerely indignant with all their presence at
the actions of the beings similar to themselves who participated in this
terrifying process and whom they called, and still call, 'Bolsheviks. '



"In my opinion, it will do no harm to tell you in this connection that that
being-experiencing of theirs which is admirably characterized by the words
'vainly to grow sincerely indignant' is also one of the unfortunate peculiarities
of the psyche of these ill-fated three-brained beings who please you,
especially the contemporary ones.
"This psychic abnormality has the effect of gradually deranging in their
common presence many functionings, both of their planetary body, already
deranged without this, and of their kesdjan body—if of course this second
being-body is already coated in them and has attained the required
'individuality.'
"And this abnormality of their psyche, namely, 'vainly to grow indignant'
or, as they sometimes say, 'to get needlessly upset,' also flows from the fact
that there has long since disappeared from their common presence the 'being
horizon' proper to three-brained beings, as well as the 'instinctive sensing of
reality in its true light. '
"On account of the absence of these two particularities in their psyche,
they cannot even vaguely suspect that individual beings similar to themselves
are in no way the cause of these terrifying processes, but that these processes
take place on their ill-fated planet from two inevitable great causes The first
of these causes is precisely that cosmic law of Solioonensius, entirely
independent of them, and the second cause, which partly depends on them, is
that, thanks to all the results of the abnormal conditions of ordinary being
existence established by them, the data that continue to be crystallized in their
common presence for bringing forth the sacred impulse of Conscience do not
in general take part in the functioning of the ordinary 'waking state' of any of
them—which is the reason why the action of the first cause takes such a
terrible form.
"As I have just said, your favorites cannot even approximately understand
that individual persons are in no way the



cause of these terrifying planetary processes and only by chance happen to
occupy positions which compel them, on account of the established
conditions of mutual existence, to manifest themselves in one role or another
And the results of these roles take one form or another, with a rigorous
conformity to law entirely independent of them themselves.
"At the height of this last process of theirs, namely, Russian Bolshevism,
beings of other communities were sincerely indignant on learning that those
who by chance had become as it were 'active' in this distressing process were
giving orders to other ordinary beings to shoot some Tom, Dick, or Harry.
"To clarify my further explanations about these terrifying processes, I must
tell you that this last process is still going on today on a large area of the
surface of this ill-fated planet, and also that during recent times these favorites
of yours have very greatly increased in number Thus if we compare the
relative number of three-brained beings destroyed in the last process with that
of earlier processes, the current one will indeed seem 'child's play. '
"In order that you may understand this better, and be able to compare those
former processes with contemporary Bolshevism, I will now describe to you a
couple of little scenes from ancient history, from, let us say, that Egypt I have
just mentioned.
"In one of the intervals between dynasties of these Egyptian pharaohs or
kings, when a process similar to this contemporary Bolshevism was taking
place in Egypt, the governing committee of the revolutionaries announced,
among other things, to all the population of that country, that 'elections' would
soon be held for the chiefs of large and small centers or, as they say, 'towns'
and 'villages,' and that these elections would be carried out according to the
following principle.
"Those would be elected as chiefs of the towns and villages



who put into their sacred urns a greater number of what are called 'kroahns'
than the others. A 'kroahn' was the name then given in Egypt to a sacrificial
offering.
"Now, my boy, according to the religion of the beings of this country,
during the ceremonies, which were conducted in special places, it was the
custom to set before each ordinary being attending these ceremonies a special
clay urn, in which, after reciting certain prayers, he had to put the vegetables
or fruit designated for that day.
"Well, the objects considered 'worthy' to be offered as sacrifices were then
called 'kroahns.' In all probability, this 'manipulation' had been invented by
the theocrats of that time as a source of revenue for the benefit of their
'spongers,' as they are called.
"In the decree about which I have just told you, it was stipulated that on
that occasion the 'kroahns' were to consist of the eyes of the bandits—the
name the ordinary three-brained beings gave to those of the ruling class
behind their backs—and that no exception was to be made for the beings of
the 'passive sex,' children, or the aged.
"It was further stated in this decree that the one who had the most 'kroahns'
in his sacred urn on the day of the elections would be appointed chief of all
Egypt and, as I already said, as regards the towns and villages, those beings
would be appointed as chiefs who had the correspondingly greatest number of
'kroahns' in their sacred urns.
"You may picture to yourself, my boy, what went on that day everywhere
in Egypt, for the sake of collecting in their sacred urns the greatest number of
eyes of the beings who in that period of the flow of time belonged to the caste
of the ruling class.
"On another occasion, also in Egypt, I witnessed a no less terrifying scene.
"For a clear representation of this, you should first know



that formerly, in every one of the large Egyptian centers or 'towns,' there was
an enormous square in which all kinds of public ceremonies were held, both
religious and military, and where masses of beings from the whole of Egypt
assembled for these occasions.
"Those beings, especially the masses who belonged at the given period to
the weaker castes, impeded the ceremonies, and therefore a certain pharaoh
ordered ropes to be stretched around the squares to prevent the beings
belonging to the 'lower castes' from disturbing the progress of the ceremonies.
"But when these ropes were stretched, it soon became evident that they
would not be able to withstand the pressure of the crowd and would always
end up by breaking So the pharaoh ordered what are called 'metal ropes' to be
made, whereupon those known as 'priests' there consecrated them and gave
them the name of sacred 'cables. '
"These sacred cables stretched around the squares used for public
ceremonies, particularly in the large towns of Egypt, were of colossal length,
sometimes as much as one 'centrotino' or, as the contemporary beings of your
planet would say, 'ten miles' long.
"Well, I once witnessed how a crowd of ordinary Egyptian beings began
to skewer up on one of these sacred cables—just like an 'Asiatic shashlik'
all the beings, without distinction of sex or age, who up till then had belonged
to the ruling class.
"And that same night, with the help of forty pairs of buffalo, this novel
'skewer' was dragged down and thrown into the river Nile.
"I saw much punishment meted out in this spirit, both during my personal
sojourns on the surface of this planet of yours and through my large
teskooano from the planet Mars.
"And your contemporary favorites, who are naive to the



nth degree, grow sincerely indignant that these Bolsheviks of theirs shot a
certain Tom Brown.
"If we compare the actions of the former three-brained beings who were
subject to this 'psychic state' with the actions of the contemporary Bolsheviks,
these latter ought even to be given praise and thanks that, although the various
consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer are completely
crystallized in their common presence—as they are in general in the presence
of all contemporary three-brained beings there—in the very heat of that
period when they were merely puppets under the influence of the cosmic law
of Solioonensius, they manifested themselves in such a way that the dead
body of the person they shot could at least be recognized as Tom Brown's and
nobody else's. "
At this place of his tale Beelzebub sighed deeply and, gazing at one spot,
became concentratedly thoughtful.
Hassein and Ahoon, with a shade of surprise but also some sadness on
their faces, began to stare at him with intense expectation.
After a little while, Hassein made an inexplicable grimace and then, in a
voice expressing pained tenderness, addressed Beelzebub, who was still deep
in thought.
"Grandfather! Dear Grandfather! "Please manifest aloud the information you acquired during your long
existence and which you have in your common presence, so particularly dear
to me, since it may give me material for an answer to the question that has
just arisen in my essence, an answer that I cannot yet even vaguely represent
to myself, having no data whatever about it for logical confrontation in any of
the spiritualized parts of my common presence.
"This question arising in my essence, the answer to which is already
necessary to the whole of my presence, consists



in this Even if, for reasons not depending on them, these unfortunate three
brained beings who breed on the planet Earth do not have the possibility
during their responsible existence of acquiring divine Objective Reason, why
is it, since they arose so long ago and their species has survived for so many
centuries, that those customs and 'instinctive automatic habits' proper to all
beings could not gradually have been formed by now in their presence thanks
to the flow of time alone, even in the abnormal conditions of their ordinary
existence—which existence, in both the 'egoistically personal' and the
'collective' sense, might then flow more or less tolerably from the point of
view of objective reality?"
Having said this, our poor Hassein looked inquiringly at the cause of the
cause of his arising.
To this question of his favorite grandson, Beelzebub replied as follows:
"Well, to be sure . . . my dear boy. In the course of long centuries many
customs and what are called 'moral habits,' often very good and useful for
their ordinary existence, were gradually established among your favorites of
the planet Earth, as on all planets where beings arise who spend part of their
existence simply in ordinary processes But herein lies the evil, that these
happy achievements of being-welfare, which become fixed in the process of
ordinary existence from the flow of time alone, and which improve through
transmission from generation to generation, sooner or later disappear entirely
or are so modified that they are automatically transformed into 'unhappy'
ones, thus increasing the number of those small harmful factors that taken as
a whole 'dilute' more and more each year both the psyche and the very
essence of your favorites.
"Of course, if at least any of these good customs and already automatized
moral habits, fixed by time in the process of their existence, could have
survived and passed by



inheritance to subsequent generations, this alone would have made their
existence, now so 'desolate' in the objective sense, a little more acceptable in
the eyes of an impartial observer.
"The causes of the complete destruction or modification of this being
welfare for their tolerable existence—arising from the good customs and
moral habits acquired in the passage of time—are once again to be found in
the abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence established by them
themselves.
"And the concentrated result of these abnormal conditions around them is
a special property that arose not long ago in their psyche, and that became the
basic cause of the aforementioned evil This property is called 'suggestibility.'
"Thanks to this strange property, only recently fixed in their psyche, all
the functionings of their common presence gradually began to change, and as
a result, each of these beings, particularly those who arose and reached
responsible age during the last centuries, came to represent in themselves a
peculiar type of cosmic formation which has the possibility of acting only if it
is constantly under the influence of another formation similar to itself.
"And indeed, my boy, at the present time all these terrestrial three-brained
beings, taken both as separate persons and as large or small groups, must
infallibly 'influence' or come under the 'influence' of others.
"To give you a clearer picture and an all-round understanding of how
customs and habits, useful for their ordinary existence, which have been
automatically acquired by them in the course of centuries, either disappear
without a trace or change for the worse on account of this property of their
strange psyche, we will take as an example those terrestrial three-brained
beings whom all other beings of your planet call 'Russians' and who make up
the majority of that community named 'Russia. '
"The existence of the beings who made up this large con



temporary community proceeded over the course of many centuries in the
neighborhood of beings belonging to certain Asiatic communities Thanks to
various events these communities had existed for a relatively long time and,
as in general happens in such cases, many good customs and moral habits had
been gradually formed and fixed in the process of their ordinary existence
And these Russians, often meeting with the beings of these, for them, 'ancient'
communities, and even at times having friendly relationships with them,
gradually adopted and began to use in the process of their ordinary existence
many of these useful customs and moral habits.
"And so, my boy, thanks to that singular property of the three-brained
beings of your planet, which arose soon after the 'Tikliamishian civilization,'
and became fixed in their psyche with an intensity due chiefly to the
progressive deterioration in the conditions of ordinary being-existence es
tablished by them—a psychic property which from the very beginning was
inherent in the common presence of the beings composing this community,
later the largest—then, on account of all this, in recent centuries they found
themselves under the 'influence' of beings of one or another of the Asiatic
communities, and the whole 'external mode' and 'associative psychic form' of
their ordinary existence proceeded under that influence.
"But later, thanks to changed circumstances arising once more from the
terrifying process of 'periodic reciprocal destruction' that exists only on that
ill-starred planet, the three-brained beings dwelling on that part of the
continent of Asia called 'Russia' were deprived of this influence and, since
'being-partkdolgduty' had also finally ceased to be actualized in their
presence, that most maleficent property of their psyche called 'suggestibility'
gradually became stronger and they, being unable to lead an independent
existence, were compelled to fall under some new influence, this time the



influence of the beings of European communities, chiefly of the community
named 'France.'
"From the time that the beings of this community of France began to
influence automatically the psyche of the beings of the community of Russia,
and the Russians were striving to imitate the French beings in everything, all
the good customs in the process of their existence and those moral habits
inherent in them, which had been borrowed either half-consciously or
automatically from the beings of ancient Asiatic communities, were gradually
forgotten, and new 'French' ones were acquired.
"Among the automatic customs and moral habits transmitted to the beings
of the community of Russia from the beings of ancient Asiatic communities,
there were thousands that were indeed very good and useful.
"From these thousands of good customs and useful habits, let us take as an
example at least two the custom of chewing what is called 'keva' after
consuming the 'first being-food', and the practice of washing oneself
periodically in what are called 'hammams.'
" 'Keva' is a certain mastic prepared from various roots, which is chewed
after eating and which, no matter how long it is chewed, hardly ever
decomposes, but on the contrary becomes more and more elastic.
"This mastic was invented by a wise being who belonged to one of the old
Asiatic communities.
"It is useful to chew this 'keva' because it increases the amount of what is
called on the Earth 'saliva' and also of other substances formed in beings and
elaborated by their planetary bodies so that the first being-food may be better
and more easily transformed in them or, as they themselves say, better and
more easily 'digested' and 'assimilated. '
"Thanks to this 'keva' their teeth are also strengthened and their mouths are
cleansed from the remains of the first food, this latter use of 'keva' is very
necessary for your



favorites as it prevents these remains from decomposing and so they do not
give off that disagreeable odor from their mouths that has already become
proper particularly to the contemporary three-brained beings there.
"The second custom, namely, that of washing themselves periodically in
special establishments called 'hammams,' was also invented by a certain
Asiatic being of ancient times.
"In order that you may clearly understand the necessity for this second
custom in the process of existence of terrestrial beings, I must first explain the
following:
"The functioning of the planetary body of beings of all forms of external
coating is in general adapted by Nature in such a way that the process of their
nourishment by the 'second being-food,' which your favorites call 'breathing,'
takes place in them not only through the 'organs of breath' but also through the
'pores' of their skin.
"Not only does the second being-food enter afresh through the pores of the
skin but certain of these pores, after the transformation of this second being
food, give off those elements of this food that are no longer needed for the
planetary body.
"These unnecessary elements should be eliminated from the pores of the
skin by gradual evaporation, thanks to factors derived from the processes
taking place in the environment of the given beings, such as movements of the
atmosphere, accidental contacts, and so on.
"But ever since your favorites invented the practice of covering themselves
with 'clothes,' these clothes of theirs have hindered the normal elimination or
evaporation of those elements of the second being-food unnecessary for the
planetary body, and these unnecessary substances, having no way of
evaporating into space and continuing to accumulate, begin to condense and
form in the various pores of their skin a deposit of a certain 'oily something. '



"From that time on, among a number of other factors, this 'something' began to contribute to the formation on this ill-fated planet of innumerable illnesses which, taken all together, are the chief cause of the gradual shortening of the duration of existence of these unfortunates. "Well, my boy, in the 'dim and distant past,' as your contemporary favorites say, a wise and learned Asiatic being by the name of Amambakhlutr once clearly noticed, in the course of his conscious observations of various facts proceeding around him, that this 'oily something' that collects in the pores of the skin has a maleficent influence on the general functioning of the whole planetary body, so he began to study this evil and search for a means of getting rid of it. "The result of the investigations and long deliberations of this Amambakhlutr, and of several other learned beings who became his followers and helpers, was that they became convinced of the impossibility of persuading beings similar to themselves not to wear clothes, and decided to find a means for artificially eliminating these residues of the second beingfood from the pores of the skin by implanting in the psyche of the beings around them some being-usage or other which would become indispensable in the course of time, and in this way would enter into their habits and customs "And what these learned Asiatic beings with the great Amambakhlutr at their head experimentally elucidated and put into practice, well, this was the origin of those 'hammams' which exist there in various places even till now. "During their scientific experiments at that time, they discovered among other things that by ordinary washing, even with hot water, it was impossible to remove the oily deposits from the pores of the skin, as these excretions of the planetary body are not on the surface of the skin but in the depths of the pores. "Their further experiments showed them that it was only possible to cleanse the pores of the skin by means of slow



warming, thanks to which the deposits of this 'oily something' could be
gradually dissolved and eliminated.
"For this purpose, they then invented those specially equipped rooms that
later came to be called 'hammams', and they knew so well how to disseminate
their sense and significance among the beings of the whole continent of Asia
that the need to make use of these rooms for the given procedure was
implanted in the psyche of all of them.
"Well, this need of going periodically to the 'hammam' became inherent in
the beings of the continent of Asia and was later transmitted to the beings of
the community of Russia.
"As regards this 'oily something' that collects in certain pores of the skin of
your favorites, I must also tell you the following:
"Since the substances composing this 'oily something,' like everything in
general existing in our Great Universe, cannot stay long in one and the same
state, they inevitably undergo the processes of evolution and involution
required by Great Nature And since during these processes there are given off
from all 'temporary' or 'transitory' cosmic arisings what are called 'secondary
active elements,' that is, elements temporarily crystallized by the 'momentum
of vibrations' and which, as everyone knows, have the property of being
perceived very 'cacophonously' by the organ of smell of beings, your favorites
on the planet Earth who do not use these 'hammams' always give off a
particular 'rastropoonilo' or, as they themselves say, 'odor,' which even they
consider 'not altogether pleasant. '
"And indeed, my boy, on certain continents there, particularly on the
continent of Europe, where the custom of going to the 'hammam' is not
prevalent, it was very difficult for me as a being with an extremely acute sense
of smell to exist among those three-brained beings on account of their
'rastropoonilo' or 'specific odor. '



"This unpleasant odor, given off by those whose skin is never specially
cleansed, was so strong that without any difficulty I could detect to which
community a given being belonged, and could even distinguish one being
from another.
"The varieties of these specific odors depend upon how long the
decomposition of oily excretions in the pores of the skin has been going on
"Fortunately for them these unpleasant odors do not affect them so
painfully.
"And they do not affect them because their sense of smell is very poorly
developed and besides, as they always exist among these odors, they
gradually become accustomed to them.
"And so, my boy, this custom of washing themselves periodically in special
'hammams' was borrowed by the Russians from the Asiatic beings, but when
they fell under the influence of the European beings and chiefly, as I have al
ready told you, of those of the community of France, then since these French
beings do not have the custom of going to the 'hammam,' the Russians also
gradually ceased going there, and thus this good custom, established among
them for centuries, began to disappear.
"Formerly, almost every Russian family had its own 'hammam,' but when I
was recently for the last time in their chief place of existence then called 'St
Petersburg,' where more than two million of these Russian beings existed,
only seven or eight of such 'hammams' were to be found, and even these were
frequented only by 'house porters' and 'workmen,' that is, beings who had
come to the capital from distant villages where the custom of going to the
'hammam' or, as they sometimes call it, the 'bath,' had not yet fallen
completely into disuse.
"As regards the majority of the inhabitants of this capital



and especially the beings of what is called the 'ruling class,' in recent times they have not been going to the 'hammam' at all, and if some 'queer chap' were to go sometimes from force of habit, he would take great pains to keep anyone else in his caste from knowing about it. 'May the devil preserve me!' thinks this bold fellow 'Otherwise such gossip will fly around that my entire career will be ruined!' "To go to the 'hammam' is now considered very 'improper' and 'unintelligent' by beings belonging to the ruling class. But it is 'improper' and 'unintelligent' only because the French, whom they regard as the 'most intelligent' contemporary beings of their planet, never go to the 'hammam.' "These unfortunates do not know, of course, that just a few decades ago, thanks as always to the abnormally established conditions of ordinary beingexistence, these same French, particularly the 'intelligentsia,' as they are called, not only never went to the 'hammam,' but did not even wash themselves in the morning in order not to spoil their fashionable artificial appearance, which was so difficult to rearrange.
"Now as regards the first-mentioned good custom that I took as an example and which two centuries ago was still an organic need of every being of the community of Russia, namely, the chewing of 'keva' after the consumption of the first being-food, this custom no longer exists at all among contemporary Russians. "However, I saw with my own eyes how the custom of chewing 'keva'—of course without any understanding of its significance—began to be implanted among the beings dwelling on the continent called 'America,' where the use of this 'keva' or, as they call it, 'chewing gum' is now very widespread and has even given rise to a great industry and branch of commerce And it is interesting to note that the



basic ingredient of this American chewing gum is exported from Russia,
namely, from the region called 'Caucasia.' The beings dwelling in that region
do not even know why these 'crazy' Americans import this root which is good
for nothing and for nobody.
"Of course the thought never enters the head of any of them that these
Americans, importing this 'good-for-nothing' root, are indeed in a subjective
sense crazy, yet objectively they are doing neither more nor less, as your
favorites say, than 'robbing' the beings of this Russia 'in broad daylight. '
"Well, my boy, a mass of other good customs and moral habits, adopted in
the course of centuries by these Russian beings and already well fixed in the
process of their ordinary existence, also began gradually to disappear during
the last two centuries when these Russians came under the influence of the
European beings, and in their place new customs and new moral habits were
formed, which they still have at the present time, such as the practice of
'kissing a lady's hand,' of 'being polite only to young ladies,' of 'looking at a
woman in the company other husband only with the left eye,' and so on and so
forth.
"Here I must emphasize, with an impulse of regret, that at the present time
the same thing is going on everywhere in the process of the ordinary existence
of the beings of all communities there, on whatever continent it may be.
"I hope, my boy, that by now you can more or less clarify the question that
arose in your being, and picture to yourself why, although their species has
existed for so long, there has not yet been formed among these unfortunate
favorites of yours the automatic being-customs and instinctive habits through
which their existence might flow more or less tolerably, even in the absence of
Objective Consciousness.
"I repeat thanks to the aforementioned property, which only recently
became fixed in their common psyche, it has



become natural for them at the present time, as it were according to law,
always to influence or to come under the influence of others.
"In both cases the results of the action of this peculiar property are
obtained without any consciousness on their part, and even without their
desire.
"From all that I have told you about the way these contemporary Russians
always follow the example of others and imitate them in everything, you can
clearly understand to what extent the functioning of the data for 'being
confrontative logical mentation' has already deteriorated in the presence of
terrestrial three-brained beings.
"In general, to follow the example of others or to set an example for others
is considered and recognized as fully reasonable and absolutely necessary
everywhere in the Universe among all three-brained beings; and if the three
brained beings of this large community of Russia follow the example of the
beings of France, this is very sensible on their part. Why not follow a good
example?
"But these unfortunates, on account of this particular property of their
psyche, as well as of several other specific features of their strange
character—which became definitely fixed in them thanks to the total
disappearance from their common presence of at least sometimes actualizing
'being-partkdolgduty'—became what are called 'compulsive copycats' and
also began to follow bad examples, and even to reject their own good customs
merely because they do not exist elsewhere.
"They do not even consider, for instance, that conditions of ordinary
existence among these French beings were perhaps built up abnormally, and
therefore they had not had time to recognize the necessity of sometimes
washing themselves in 'hammams' and of chewing 'keva' after the first being
food.
"But to throw away their own good customs for the sole



reason that they do not exist among the beings of France whose example they follow—this is indeed genuine 'turkeyness.' "Although this peculiarity which I have just called 'turkeyness' has already become inherent in almost all the three-brained beings who breed on this planet of yours, its manifestation and results are especially noticeable among the three-brained beings who breed on the continent of Europe. "This I observed and understood later when I left St Petersburg to travel in various countries of this continent of Europe, where I happened to remain much longer than on my former visits, and therefore had time to observe and study in all possible conditions the finer details of the psyche not only of beings taken separately but also in groups. "As a matter of fact, the form of external existence of all the communities on the continent of Europe is scarcely to be distinguished from that of the beings of the large community of Russia. "The form of existence of the beings of the various groups on this continent differs only insofar as the accidentally longer duration of existence of any community has allowed time for the automatic acquisition of certain good customs and instinctive habits which then become proper to the beings of that community alone. "Here, by the way, it should be emphasized that the duration of existence of any community does indeed play an important role as regards the acquisition of good customs and instinctive habits. "But unfortunately for all the three-brained beings of the whole Universe, whatever their degree of Reason, the existence of any more or less organized group among them is in general short-lived, thanks as always to that chief particularity of theirs, namely, 'periodic reciprocal destruction. ' "As soon as good being-usages begin to be established in the ordinary existence of any of their groups, this terrible



process suddenly breaks out, and then either the good customs and habits
automatically acquired during centuries are totally destroyed, or the beings of
the given group, thanks to the aforementioned property, fall under the
influence of beings of another group having nothing in common with those
under whose influence they were before.
"Therefore all these customs and moral habits acquired during centuries
are very soon replaced by 'new' ones, which in most cases are half-baked and
are good, as is said, 'only for a day.'



CHAPTER 35
A change in the appointed course of falling of the
intersystem ship Karnak
AT THIS POINT in Beelzebub's conversation with his close companions, he
was told that the captain of the ship was asking permission to speak with him
personally.
Soon after Beelzebub had given his consent, the captain entered and,
bowing respectfully, addressed Beelzebub.
"Your Reverence," he said, "at the beginning of our journey you were
gracious enough to let fall a hint that on the return journey you might decide
to stop at the Holy Planet Purgatory to see the family of your son Tooilan If
this is indeed your intention, then it would be better if you gave me the order
now, because we shall soon be passing through the solar system 'Khalmiani,'
and if we do not alter the falling of our ship right away, before passing
through this system, we shall greatly lengthen the path of the ship's falling. "
"Yes, my dear Captain," Beelzebub replied "There is nothing against
stopping on the way at that holy planet Who knows whether there will be
another such happy occasion for me to go there and visit the family of my
dear son Tooilan. "
The captain bowed and was on the point of going out, when Beelzebub, as
if remembering something, suddenly stopped him and said:
"Wait, my dear Captain, I have another request to make of you " And
when the captain came back and sat down in his appointed place, Beelzebub
continued:
"My request is that, after our visit to the Holy Planet Purgatory, you be good enough to direct the course of falling



of our ship Karnak so that we may make a stop on the surface of the planet 'Deskaldino. ' "The point is that at the present period of the flow of time the planet
Deskaldino is the permanent place of existence of the great Saroonoorishan,
my first educator, who was, so to say, the primary cause of the spiritualization
of all the parts of my genuine common presence.
"And, before returning to the sphere on which I arose, I should like to take
advantage of the opportunity, as I did on another occasion, to prostrate myself
at the feet of the prime creator of my genuine being, the more so, since just
now, returning from what was perhaps my last conference, it was apparent not
only to me personally but also to most of the individuals I met that the
functioning of each of the separate spiritualized parts of my common presence
was wholly satisfactory, and in consequence, an inextinguishable being
impulse of gratitude arose in me toward the great Saroonoorishan.
"I am well aware, my dear Captain, that I am giving you no easy task,
because I already witnessed the difficulties of carrying out such a request
when I was returning after my gracious pardon to the place of my arising, the
planet Karatas, and desired to visit the planet Deskaldino on the way On that
occasion the captain of the intersystem ship Omnipresent had agreed to this
and had directed the falling of the vessel toward the atmosphere of that planet
Overcoming all the obstacles with great effort, he succeeded in carrying out
my request And thus, before going back to my native land, I was able to reach
the surface of the planet Deskaldino and have the happiness of greeting the
great Saroonoorishan, the creator of my genuine being-existence, and receive
what was most dear and most precious to me, his 'creator-benediction.' "
To this request of Beelzebub's, the captain replied: "Very good, Your Reverence, I will think over how to



carry out your desire I do not know just what the obstacles were at that time for the captain of the ship Omnipresent, but now, on the direct route between the Holy Planet Purgatory and the planet Deskaldino there lies the solar system called 'Salzmanino,' which includes numerous cosmic concentrations destined, for purposes of the general trogoautoegocratic process, for the transformation and radiation of the substance 'zilnotrago', and therefore it will scarcely be possible for our ship Karnak to fall in a direct line through this system But in any event, I will try in one way or another to satisfy the desire expressed by Your Reverence. " Having said this the captain rose and, bowing respectfully to Beelzebub,
went out.
When the captain of the ship had left the place where Beelzebub was seated, Hassein ran to his grandfather and, sitting down as usual at his feet, coaxingly asked him to continue his tale of what had happened to him after his departure from the capital of that large community of the beings of the planet Earth, then called "St Petersburg. "



CHAPTER 36
Just a wee bit more about the Germans
BEELZEBUB began thus: "From St Petersburg I went first of all to what are called the 'Scandinavian
countries,' and afterward I settled in the chief center of the beings of the
contemporary community called 'Germany. ' "
Having said this, Beelzebub patted the curly head of his grandson, and
then with a kind but somewhat mischievous smile he continued:
"This time, my boy, as I wish you to have a certain understanding of the
peculiar psyche of the three-brained beings of this contemporary European
group also, I shall depart from my usual custom of initiating you into various
details of my views, but instead will set you a 'problem ' In trying to solve it
you will make thoroughly clear to yourself the specific character of the
psyche of the beings of that European community, and have ideal practice for
your active mentation.
"This original problem I have devised is that, through active mentation,
you are to deduce those logical data, the totality of which should reveal to you
the very essence of the reason why these particular beings, in whatever part of
what they call their 'Fatherland' they happen to be, invariably observe the
innocent custom, whenever they gather for some 'solemnity' or other, or are
simply 'on a spree,' of singing one and the same song, composed by
themselves and in the highest degree original, consisting of the following
words:
Blödsinn, Blödsinn, Du mein
Vergnügen,



Stumpfsinn, Stumpfsinn, Du meime
Lust
"Well, my boy, if you can make anything out of this riddle, there will be
fulfilled in your common presence the wise saying of our dear teacher Mullah
Nasr Eddin, expressed in the following words 'The greatest happiness is to
obtain the pleasurable along with the profitable. '
"It will be profitable for you because you will have ideal practice for your
active mentation, and pleasurable, because you will satisfy your desire to
understand the specificity of the psyche of the three-brained beings belonging
to this contemporary European group.
"Since the beings of this contemporary group, as I have already told you,
are the direct successors of the ancient Greeks as inventors of every possible
kind of 'science,' and since your deductions from the problem I have set you
might be diametrically opposite to 'logical confrontation,' I find it necessary to
help you a little by giving you two more facts.
"The first fact is that certain words of this song are untranslatable into any
of the other languages there, in spite of there being so many on that planet that
it is called a 'thousand-tongued hydra', and the second fact is that when it
finally became inherent in the beings of this group, just as in the ancient
Greeks, to invent every sort of maleficent means for 'weakening' what is
called 'logical being-mentation,' already sufficiently weakened without this,
they also invented a so-called 'grammatical rule,' according to which during
any 'exchange of opinions' they always place the particle of negation after an
affirmation—for instance, instead of saying 'I do not want this,' they say, 'I
want this no.t
"Thanks to this 'grammatical rule' of theirs, in any exchange of opinions
the listener is first obliged to consider each proposition as if it were liable to
happen, which arouses



in him a certain 'being-diardookino' or, as they would say, a certain
'experiencing.' And only later the speaker, in conforming to their grammatical
rule, finally pronounces their famous 'nicht,' with the result that there is
produced in their common presence each time something that slowly but
surely gives rise to the aforesaid specific character of their common psyche,
and all this should help you to elucidate the original problem I have set you. "



CHAPTER 37
France
A LITTLE LATER, Beelzebub went on "After Germany, for a short time the
place of my existence on the continent of Europe was in the community
called 'Italy,' and after Italy, in the community that had become for the beings
of Russia the 'source' for fostering that 'vice,' long since fixed in the abnormal
process of the ordinary existence of terrestrial three-brained beings of recent
centuries, which is called 'suggestibility', that is to say, I settled among the
beings of the community of France.
"Now, my boy, I wish to inform you about the specific aspects of the
psyche of those three-brained beings of France in such a way that you may at
the same time realize to what extent a deterioration has taken place among
your favorites in the normal capacity for crystallizing all the being-data for
ruminating impartially and personally, and how a subjective 'essence-opinion'
is formed in them about every reality, at times entirely opposite to what it
would be if they perceived that same reality directly through their own
impressions.
"In order to make clear what I have just told you it will be useful, in my
opinion, to take these French beings as an example.
"Nowadays, among the beings of all the groups breeding on the continent
of Europe, where their so-called 'cultured existence' is concentrated, as well
as on all the other continents, there is infallibly crystallized from the very
beginning of their formation into responsible beings data for their image of
the individuality of these French beings, which evoke in them a fixed idea
that of all the beings similar to them on their planet, these French are, as they
express it, the most 'depraved' and 'immodest. '



"Before I chose the community of France as my permanent place of
existence, data for just such an image about them had been formed in my own
presence because, in going about almost everywhere and speaking with beings
of various groups inhabiting the terra firma parts of your planet, I frequently
heard this sort of opinion about the French beings.
"Although I had sometimes been in that community of France, on my
earlier visits I paid no special attention to the particularities of the psyche of
those beings or to this opinion about them held by the beings of nearly all the
other communities there.
"This time, however, on settling in one of their provincial towns, my
presence instinctively expected, of course, to receive impressions of 'immoral'
and 'depraved' manifestations of the local three-brained beings, but to my
great and ever-increasing surprise, I soon discovered that I would not perceive
anything of the kind.
"A little later, when I began to go about among them, and even to make
friends with some of them and with their families, not only did the data for
this 'automatic opinion' about them begin to be decrystallized in me, but there
began to be crystallized the required 'being-data' for finding out how there
could have been formed in the common presence of the beings of other
communities an opinion that was so contrary to reality.
"This question interested me more and more each day because while
existing among them, it gradually became clear to me that the beings of that
community were in fact not the most 'depraved' and 'immoral' but, on the
contrary, the most 'patriarchal' and 'modest' of all the three-brained beings
grouped on the continent of Europe.
"So I then set about making observations and gathering corresponding
information to clear up for myself this misunderstanding of your
contemporary favorites.



"While I was in that provincial town, I was unable to throw any light on this question, but later, when I happened to go to the capital of that community, from the very first day the basic causes of this misunderstanding gradually became clear to my Reason. "For the elucidation of these causes I relied on my impartial observations and considerations, as well as on the following facts: "When I arrived in that capital named 'Paris'—which, by the way, in the 'logicnestarian crystallizations' of the contemporary three-brained beings breeding on all the continents of your planet had become a center of their imaginary 'culture,' just as the cities of Samlios, Koorkalai, Babylon, and so on had been for the beings of former periods—I went straight from the railway station to a hotel that had been recommended to me by an acquaintance in the city of Berlin. "The first thing I happened to notice was that the entire staff of this hotel were foreigners, most of whom spoke the English language, whereas not so long before, it seems, the employees of this hotel spoke nothing but Russian. "The day after my arrival in that present-day Samlios, I inquired for a certain being belonging to the community called 'Persia,' to whom I had an introduction from one of my good friends existing in the Persian capital. "This new Persian acquaintance of mine suggested that same evening that I
should go out with him to what is called the 'Boulevard des Capucines' and sit
for a while in the then famous 'Grand Café.'
"When we arrived at this Grand Café we sat down at one of the many tables which, as is usual in Paris, took up half the sidewalk. "As I have already told you, a 'cafe' serves the same purpose for the beings on the continent of Europe as the 'chaikhanas' for the beings dwelling on the continent of Asia. The only difference is that in the 'chaikhanas' they give you



a kind of reddish liquid to drink, squeezed out of a certain well-known flower
there, while in the cafés on the continent of Europe, although they also serve a
liquid, not only is it completely black but from what it is squeezed—no one
knows except the proprietor of the establishment.
"We began to drink the black liquid served to us, called 'coffee. ' "Here too I noticed that all the employees of this Grand Café or, as they
call them, 'waiters,' were beings from other groups, chiefly from the European
community called 'Italy. '
"You must know that in general in this part of the city of Paris—this
'foreign Paris'—each 'business' is a specialty of the beings of one or another
community of the continent of Europe or of other continents.
"And thus, seated at a table in that famous Grand Café, or rather outdoors
in front of it, we began to watch the passers-by strolling up and down on the
other half of the pavement.
"Among the strolling crowd were beings of almost all the separate groups
of the continent of Europe and of other continents—mostly, of course, from
those communities whose turn it was at that period to be rich, predominantly
beings from the continent of America.
"For in Paris the beings of the continent of America had by this time
definitely taken the place of the beings of the great community of Russia
since the 'death' of that community.
"Most of those strolling by were beings belonging to the ruling class, who
often come to the 'capital of the world' to have, as they say, a 'good time.'
"There were also many businessmen among them, who had come to Paris
for what is called the 'fashion trade,' chiefly perfumery and women's clothes
"Among the motley crowd walking along the Boulevard



des Capucines, one could see many young people who had come to learn both the 'latest dances' and how to design 'fashionable hats.'
"While we were talking and watching that mixed crowd whose faces reflected satisfaction at the fulfillment of a long-cherished dream, my new acquaintance, the young Persian, suddenly turned to me in surprise and, pointing with his finger at a passing couple, exclaimed: " 'Look! Look at that! There go some "real French people!" ' "I looked and saw that indeed this couple greatly resembled the beings I had seen in provincial towns of that country. "After they had disappeared in the crowd, we began to speculate about the reason why this 'genuine' French couple came to be in that part of their capital. "After various surmises, we concluded that this couple probably lived in some outlying quarter of the real French Paris and had gone for some family celebration or other to their relatives' in another part of this French Paris on the opposite side of the city. "Evidently they had drunk rather too much at that family feast, and after the celebration, not wanting to make a detour, they decided to return home by the direct route, which happened to pass right by the Grand Café. "Probably this was the only reason why these genuine French people were to be seen in this part of Paris. "Talking all the while, we continued to watch the passing crowd decked out in the latest fashions. "Although most of them were showing off the latest 'creations,' it was obvious that these clothes had only just been bought—today or yesterdayand on close observation and by comparing their faces with their clothes, one could be



reasonably sure that in the ordinary course of their existence at home they rarely had the possibility of being so expensively dressed and of feeling so carefree. "Among the 'visiting foreign princes,' as some of the 'natives' call them, swarms of 'professionals of both sexes' —also foreigners but already well acclimatized to that part of Paris—began to appear, whereupon my new acquaintance, the young Persian, suggested that he become my Paris cicerone and that we go to what are called the 'places of ill fame' and take a look at French 'depravity.' "I agreed, and we left the Grand Café and went first to what is known as a 'brothel' situated nearby. "There I learned that the owner of this 'noble establishment' was a certain
Spanish Jew.
"In the rooms of this house was a crowd of women 'Poles,' 'Viennese,' 'Jews,' and 'Italians,' and even two 'Negresses.' "I had wanted to see how 'real Frenchwomen' appeared in this setting, but from my inquiries it became clear that there was not a single 'real Frenchwoman' in this establishment. "Leaving this brothel we returned to the boulevards and walked along observing the varied crowd. "At every step we passed numerous beings of the female sex bearing obvious signs of the aim of their 'nocturnal quests' on these boulevards. "All these women belonged to the previously mentioned nationalities as
well as to others and included 'Swedes,' 'English,' 'Russians,' 'Spaniards,'
'Moldavians,' and so on, but scarcely one genuine Frenchwoman.
"Soon some dubious-looking beings of the male sex accosted us and
proposed that we do a certain 'Grand Duke' with them.
"At first I did not understand what 'Grand Duke' meant,



but after various inquiries it became clear that this odd expression had
acquired a definite meaning there during the time when the now defunct
'monarchic Russia' still flourished.
"In that period, it seemed, the beings belonging to the ruling class of the
now dead Russia were very fond of the 'capital of the world' and often went
there, and almost every one of them, just to swagger, passed himself off as a
titled personage such as a 'count,' a 'baron,' or a 'duke,' but most frequently as
a 'grand duke ' And, since all of them unfailingly made the rounds of all the
dubious places of 'foreign Paris,' this tour was called by the professional
guides the 'Grand Duke's tour.
"Taking one of these guides, we went on to see the nocturnal sights of that
'contemporary Koorkala. '
"We visited various of these 'haunts'—the Café of the 'homosexuals,' the
club of the 'lesbians,' and many other 'dens of iniquity,' where one can see all
sorts of abnormalities such as recur from time to time in all the chief 'centers
of culture' of these unfortunates.
"Going from one of these disreputable places to another we eventually
reached the famous streets of 'Montmartre,' which are not strictly speaking on
Montmartre itself but on the lower slope of the district of that name, which
abounds in every kind of disreputable 'nightclub,' intended however not for
the beings of the community of France but exclusively for 'foreigners. '
"Aside from these dubious establishments there are many restaurants there,
also designed for foreigners, that stay open until dawn.
"This whole district in general comes to life only at night, by day it is
almost 'dead,' as they express it, and not one foreign visitor ever goes there
"All these restaurants have what are called open 'stages.'



on which are presented various 'amazing things' that supposedly take place
among beings similar to themselves existing on other parts of the surface of
their planet.
"They show the 'belly dance' of the African beings, Caucasians with their
'dagger dances,' and mulattoes with their 'snakes'—in a word, whatever is
considered that season to be a 'fashionable novelty'!
"But what they show in the 'Montmartre theaters' as supposedly
proceeding among the beings similar to them breeding on other continents of
their planet has nothing in common with what I, who had existed everywhere
and had observed and studied all the specific manifestations of the beings of
each locality, had seen with my own eyes in those very places.
"Recently in this Montmartre many 'special Russian restaurants' have been
opened, and in these Russian restaurants, as well as in others, the so-called
'artists' or 'actors' are beings of the great community of Russia, chiefly from
the former 'ruling class.'
"Here I may as well tell you that only a short time ago the fathers and
grandfathers of these 'artists' or 'actors' of the contemporary 'theater
restaurants,' when they frequented the same Montmartre establishments—at
the expense, of course, of the sweat of their peasants—ridiculed and insulted
the individual dignity of beings of other communities, but today, their
children and grandchildren have to humble themselves and serve as objects
for the satisfaction of the 'hasnamussian caprices' of newcomers from other
communities whose pockets 'bulge with money.'
"As regards such a state of affairs, our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin has another
very wise saying:
" 'If a father likes to ride, even on a child's sled, his son will have to drag
the big village sleigh up the mountain.



"While we were sitting in one of those restaurants, my new Persian friend
was called away by some other Persian acquaintances of his, and I remained
alone at the table with the champagne that one is always obliged to order at
night in these restaurants of Montmartre. "
At this point in his tale Beelzebub sighed deeply, and then continued:
"Just now, while I was telling you about that evening spent in a restaurant
in Montmartre among the contemporary three-brained beings breeding on the
planet Earth, the 'being-sarpitimnian sensation' I experienced at that time has
involuntarily been revived in me, and at this moment the memory of
everything I experienced is so intensely and repeatedly associated in all three
spiritualized parts of my common presence that it compels me to digress from
the theme I began, in order to share with you the sad and distressing
reflections induced in me by my solitude in those dreadful surroundings in
Montmartre after my young Persian cicerone had left me.
"The fact is that for the second time in the whole of my existence, the
process took place in my being of this same 'being-sarpitimnian' sensation,
which once before had engendered in my common presence a feeling of
'revolt' on account of the 'lack of foresight' of various kinds on the part of our
Most High, Most Saintly Cosmic Individuals, whereby all these objective
misfortunes arose, and will perhaps go on arising on the planet Earth and
even in all our Great Universe.
"And this time my being-mentation began to associate in the following sequence: "How was it possible not to have foreseen, in their calculations of the harmonious movement of cosmic concentrations, that the comet Kondoor would collide with this ill-fated planet Earth?



"If those who should have done so had foreseen this, none of the
misfortunes issuing one from another would have happened, and there would
have been no need to implant in the presence of the first three-brained beings
of this ill-fated planet that organ kundabuffer, so maleficent for them, which
was the cause of all the subsequent distressing and terrifying results.
"It is true that later when this maleficent organ was no longer necessary it
was destroyed, yet again they did not foresee that by the destruction of the
organ itself the possibility was not destroyed that in the future, owing to the
peculiar manner of existence of these beings, the consequences of its
properties would be crystallized in the presence of their descendants.
"In other words, this time also they did not foresee that even though it was
possible to destroy that organ, the fundamental cosmic law of
Heptaparaparshinokh with its 'mdnel-ins' nevertheless remains the same as
regards the evolutionary process for the three-brained beings of the planet
Earth as it is for everything existing in the whole Universe.
"It was thanks particularly to the second almost criminal lack of foresight
that this most terrible situation has come about for the three-brained beings
there, that is to say, although on the one hand, all the possibilities for coating
the 'higher being-bodies' exist in their common presence as in the presence of
all three-brained beings of our Great Universe, on the other hand, due to the
crystallization in them of the various consequences of the properties of the
organ kundabuffer, it is almost impossible for them to bring the perfecting of
the higher sacred parts coated in them up to the required degree And since, in
accordance with the fundamental cosmic laws, such formations as the 'higher
being-parts' coated in the common presence of three-brained



beings are not subject to decomposition on planets, and since their planetary bodies cannot exist endlessly and must inevitably undergo the process of the sacred 'rascooarno' at the proper time, the unfortunate 'higher being-bodies' arising in these terrestrial three-brained beings must inevitably languish forever in all kinds of exterior planetary forms.
"So, my boy, sitting alone in that restaurant in Montmartre, watching those contemporary favorites of yours, I continued to reflect. "How many centuries have passed since I began to observe the existence of
the three-brained beings of this ill-fated planet!
"In the course of these long centuries many Sacred Individuals have been sent from Above with the special aim of helping them to deliver themselves from the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, yet nothing has changed here and the whole process of ordinary being-existence goes on just as before "During all this time, I have observed no difference whatever between the three-brained beings of this planet who existed nearly a hundred of their centuries ago and the contemporary ones. "Are not the beings sitting here in this restaurant the same, and do they not
behave just as unbecomingly as the beings of the city of Samlios on the
continent of Atlantis, which in its day was considered 'the source and the
place of concentration of the results attained in the sense of the perfecting of
their Reason'—or as contemporary beings would say, their chief 'center of
culture'—and where I also went sometimes to sit in their 'sakroopiaks,' as they
called such restaurants.
"After Atlantis perished, many, many centuries passed



"The three-brained beings increased considerably and their chief 'center of
culture' was established on the continent of Grabontzi, which today is called
'Africa.'
"Again many centuries passed, and their principal center of culture became
the city of Koorkalai on the continent of Asia in the ancient community called
'Tikliamish.'
"In those days, too, I used to sit among them in their 'kaltaani,' which were
like contemporary restaurants Was I not a witness of similar scenes there also?
"There in front of me, that stout gentleman with an enormous growth on
his neck, sitting with two young street girls dress him in the costume of a
'Kafirian'—would he not look exactly like that type I once saw sitting in a
'kaltaan' in the city of Koorkalai?
"Or over there, on the left, at that other table, the young man holding forth
in a squeaky voice with such conviction to his 'bottle companions' about the
causes of the disorders in some community . . . put a 'chambardakh' on his
head and would he not be exactly like a real 'Khan of the mountains,' as they
were then called?
"And that tall man, alone in the corner, putting on airs and making eyes at
a lady sitting with her husband at a nearby table . . . is he not a genuine
'Veroonkietz'?
"And these waiters, exactly like dogs with their tails between their legs,
serving the people sitting there . . . are they not 'Asklay slaves'?
"After Tikliamish several more centuries passed, and I happened to be in
the majestic city of Babylon. Was it not the same there too? Were not the
three-brained beings of that city these same Asklays, Kafirians,
Veroonkietzes, Klians, and so on?
"Only their clothing and the names of their nationalities have changed
"In Babylonian times they were called 'Assyrians,' 'Per



sians,' 'Sikitians,' 'Aravians,' and various other names ending in 'ian.'
"Yes . . . and now, after so many centuries I am here again in their contemporary 'center of culture,' this time in the city of Paris "And again it is the same . . . shouting, uproar, laughter, invective . . . just as it was in the city of Babylon, in Koorkalai, and even in Samlios, their first center of culture. "Do not these contemporary beings gather to pass the time in a way unbecoming to three-brained beings, as did the beings of all former periods of existence on that ill-fated planet? "During all the time I have been observing these unfortunates, not only
have whole peoples and many of their centers of culture disappeared without
a trace but even the very terra firma on which they existed has completely
changed or disappeared from the face of the planet, as happened for example
to the continent of Atlantis.
"After Samlios, their next center was established on the continent of Grabontzi. Have not the peoples inhabiting it also disappeared in the same way? And if the continent itself has not vanished, at least the place where its center lay is now so completely covered with sands that nothing remains but the desert known as the 'Sahara. ' "Again many centuries passed. Their new center was established in
Tikliamish. What is left of it but a desert, called the 'Black Sands'?
"If, by chance, some once famous nation has been spared to the thousandth generation, it is now vegetating in complete nothingness, somewhere not far from the place where it formerly existed.
"Centuries have succeeded centuries "I saw their center of culture, the city of Babylon. What has remained of this truly great city? A few stones of the



city itself, and a few remnants of formerly great peoples who, though they
still exist, are looked down upon by their contemporaries as utterly
insignificant.
"And what will become of their present center of culture, the city of Paris,
and the peoples, so powerful today, who surround it the French, Germans,
English, Dutch, Italians, Americans, and so forth—future centuries will show.
"Meanwhile, one thing only is certain those unfortunate germs of 'higher
being-bodies,' which arose and continue to arise in some of the three-brained
beings here, are condemned, as I have already told you, to 'languish' in the
presences of abnormal forms of all kinds—forms which it has become proper
to this ill-starred planet Earth to actualize, owing to the nonlawful
consequences arising from the lack of foresight of certain of our Most High,
Most Sacred Common-Cosmic Individuals.
"I was still absorbed in such thoughts, so sorrowful for my essence, when
my new friend, the young Persian, returned.
"After a while, as this restaurant became extremely noisy and stifling, we
decided to go on to another place also in Montmartre.
"But when we got up to leave, a group of beings sitting at the next table,
who had overheard us talking about the place we intended to go to, invited us
to join them for a while at their table and then go on together They asked us to
wait until a friend of theirs arrived.
"These new acquaintances, as it turned out, were beings from the continent
of America.
"Although it was growing more and more unpleasant in that restaurant and
the din of drunken voices was increasing, we agreed at first to wait for their
friend, but when a row suddenly broke out in a far corner of the room we left
without waiting for these Americans.
"And the row had started, as it transpired, because one



being struck a drinking companion on the head with a champagne bottle,
simply because the latter refused to drink to the health of the prime minister
of some government or other, but insisted on drinking to the health of the
'Sultan of Toogoort.'
"One of the Americans who did not want to wait any longer for his friend
went with us to the other restaurant.
"On closer acquaintance, this American three-brained being proved to be
observant, jolly, and talkative.
"All the way there, and at the new place we went to, he talked all the time
and made us laugh, chiefly because of his clever and apt comments on the
comic aspects of the passers-by and the other customers in the restaurant.
"Upon questioning him, we learned that this American was the proprietor
of a large, fashionable dancing school in Paris.
"From all that he told us about his business, I understood that the pupils of
his school consisted entirely of American beings who came there especially to
learn a favorite American dance, the 'fox trot.'
"I also learned that this 'fox trot' was purely American in origin and that it
was all the rage, especially in America.
"So when we had chosen a new brand of champagne, and this jolly
American had stopped his chatter for a moment, I asked him:
" 'Tell me please, my dear sir, if this is the case, why do you not have your
school at home in America instead of here in the city of Paris, so far from
your own country and from the source of this beneficial "fox trot"?'
" 'What on earth do you mean?' he exclaimed in a tone of sincere surprise
'But I have a large family.'
" 'If I had my school in my native country, not only would my family
starve to death, but I should not even be able to rent a damp basement in New
York to shelter us in bad weather from the freezing north winds there.



'But here in Paris, thank the Lord, there are plenty of people who want to
learn the "fox trot," and will pay whatever you ask for it.
'I don't understand,' I interrupted 'You tell me that all your pupils here
are from your own country, and in the same breath you say that over there
nobody would attend your school How do you explain that?'
" 'That's the whole trick,' answered this honorable American.
" 'The cause of this is a very little "psychological kink" from among the
number of other specific kinks that all together make up the "stupidity" of my
compatriots.
" 'The point is that my school is in Paris or, as the "cognoscenti" at home in
America say, in the "contemporary Babylon. "
" 'And this contemporary Babylon is so popular with our Americans that
every one of them considers it an obligation to visit this world capital.
" 'Every American who has managed to save up even a few dollars simply
has to come here.
" 'And, by the way, do you know it is not so easy for us to save money in
America It is only here in Europe that they think that in America the streets
are paved with dollars Let me tell you, for the people who live there, those
American dollars are really not at all easy to come by Every cent must be
earned by the sweat of one's brow.
" 'In America we do not pay, as they do in certain European countries, for
such ephemeral values as "fame," "renown," "talent," and so forth.
'For example, here in Europe, if some painter or other once happens to
paint a good picture and becomes famous, then forever afterward, no matter
what trash he may produce, the public will always pay a high price for it,
simply because it is said to be the work of that famous painter 'At home in
America, however, it is a different story.



Everything is done for cash, and every product is valued by its weight and measure "Name," "talent," "genius," and all that sort of merchandise is cheap with us and you can only get dollars there with hard work. 'But fortunately for me, our Americans have many weaknesses, and among them is the passion for "seeing Europe." " 'To satisfy that passion, every American tries hard, even at times depriving himself of necessities, to save up little by little his hard-earned dollars, to be able to go to Europe and of course to the "capital of the world" Paris. " 'That is why there are always so many of my compatriots here that the streets of Paris, as is said, are "paved with Americans " And as our Americans have still another highly developed weakness, namely "vanity," they are flattered if people find out that they have learned the fox trot not merely in Philadelphia or Boston, but in Paris itself, where all the fashionable "novelties" of the Earth originate And as the fox trot is a fashionable novelty, the "Paris fox trot" is for them the last word in civilization. " 'And so, thanks to these two "ferments" in my compatriots, I, who am only a poor dancing teacher, always have plenty of Americans here who pay me well. " 'True, they pay me in francs and not in dollars, but of course, the moneychangers must also earn something— they also have families. '
"After this explanation of his, I asked him: " 'Please tell me, my dear sir, is it possible that your compatriots come to Paris and stay here so long just to learn this "fox trot" of yours?' 'Why only the fox trot?' he replied 'While they are here they also visit the city and its outskirts, and sometimes they even travel quite a distance In short, during this time they also "study" Europe.
'They "visit" and "study" Europe in order, as they say



at home, to "complete their education and schooling", but between ourselves,
this is merely one of the parrotlike phrases of those of us who pretend to be
real Englishmen. Actually my compatriots come to see Paris, as well as Eu
rope, solely to satisfy their vanity.
'They travel not to become more learned or well informed but simply to
be able to boast afterward to their acquaintances at home that they have been
to Europe and have seen this, that, and the othe.r
'But do you know how my dear compatriots visit and study Europe?
You don't? Then listen to this:
'Here in Europe every large town has a branch of an establishment
named "Book and Son" well suited to this particular need, and of course there
is one of these branches in Paris.
" 'Well then, these dear compatriots of mine gather together like a flock of
sheep, in groups of several dozen, and a whole party of "tourists" are seated in
an enormous "Book's bus" and go wherever they are taken.
" 'On that Book's bus, beside the driver there is another person, referred to
as a "Book's sleepy-type. "
" 'During the tour of that famous Book's bus, this "sleepy-type" calls out
from time to time in a weak voice the names of the places and the various
historical and non-historical sights of Paris and its environs, which he has
learned by rote from the itinerary mapped out by Mr Book himself .
" 'These "sleepy-types" have very weak voices and look half-consumptive
because they are usually very tired and don't get enough sleep, and this is
probably because many of them work hard somewhere else at night in order
to eke out their tiny earnings from Book and Son, which are not enough for
them to live on, since it is no easy task to support a family, especially in Paris
" 'And if my dear compatriots hear little of what these



"sleepy-types" say with their feeble voices, what difference does it make?
Isn't it all the same to them what that sleepy creature is mumbling, or in what
voice? They really don't need to know any details of what they are seeing.
Why should they care what they see and what it all means? All they need is
the "fact" that they were in such and such a place and, in general, "saw
everything."
" 'They are fully satisfied with this, for afterward in conversation they can
say with a clear conscience that they were here, there, and everywhere, and all
the other Americans will think that they are not just the "tail of a donkey," but
have been to Europe and visited everything and seen all the sights that every
"cultivated" person must see.
" 'Ah, my good Sir! Do you think I am the only one who lives off the
stupidities of my compatriots?
'Who am I, after all? I am a little man, just a "dancing teacher. " 'But did you notice the fat man who was sitting with me in the first
restaurant? Well . . . he is a real shark. And incidentally, this species has been
breeding in great numbers in America, especially in recent times.
" 'That fat man, an Americanized English Jew, is the principal partner in a
well-established American firm.
" 'This firm has branches in many American and European cities, and he is
the man who performs the functions of director of the Paris branch.
'This firm not only fills its coffers by exploiting the stupidity of my
compatriots, but unfortunately adds its share of sharp practices.
" 'And this is how they cook up their shady deals: " 'The Paris branch of the firm, using American methods of advertising, is
already widely known in America, and many of my compatriots, impelled by
that same "vanity" and other weaknesses proper to them, regularly order their
fashionable wardrobes from the branch here, and this branch



sends them "genuine French models" from the "capital of the world. "
'All this is done quite honorably, according to the rules of modern
business, and on the basis of "triple-entry bookkeeping" and "schachermacher
accounting."
'As for the intimate side of the business of this "reputable firm," founded
by various American "sharks," let me tell you how these "sharks" skin
everyone to fill their own bottomless pockets.
'Well, when the Paris branch receives a mail order from one of its
American customers, this is forwarded di-rect-ly to the branch in Germany,
where materials and labor are much cheaper than here And the German branch
slow-ly and lei-sure-ly fulfills this American mail order, following all the
dictates of "Paris fashions," whereupon it calmly sticks a "Paris label" on its
product and, again di-rect-ly, ships it by steamer from Hamburg to its New
York branch, and there the client receives her order, happy and proud that
tomorrow she will wear "not just anything" but a real Paris "creation" made in
Paris itself, according to the "latest fashion."
" 'What is most interesting in all this is that nobody loses out through the
"commission business" of this "respectable firm", on the contrary it is
convenient and profitable for everyone Even the French, who are hosts in the
"capital of the world," gain something from this commerce of theirs
although, it is true, only insofar as they make a profit from the postage stamps
that the Paris branch sticks on its correspondence.
" 'As you see, everyone is satisfied and everyone is pleased, and even
benefited, and what is more, the whole transaction justifies an axiom of
political economy—not universally accepted, by the way—that without an
international exchange of goods nations cannot possibly exist.



" 'But what am I? . . . I am only a poor little dancing teacher!'
"This jolly American was going to say something more, but at that
moment we heard a great hubbub in the next room and desperate cries of both
men and women We got up to leave the restaurant, and it was only when we
were in the street that we found out that a being of the female sex from the
community of Spam had flung vitriol in the face of another female being from
the community of Belgium, because she had given a present of a cigar case
engraved with the inscription, 'Always at your service,' to a being of the male
sex from the community called 'Georgia,' whose existence in Paris had been
supported until that day by the first woman.
"When we got into the street it was very late, day was beginning to break.
So we took leave of that amusing American and went to our hotels.
"On the way home, while pondering over everything I had seen and heard in
that famous Montmartre, I understood quite well why and how an opinion so
contrary to reality had been formed in the beings belonging to other com
munities about those beings of the community of France.
"Thanks to everything I had seen and heard that night, it became clear to
me that the beings of other communities, on arriving in France, go first of all
to this part of Paris and to similar places where everything without exception
has been organized and arranged especially for them by foreigners like
themselves, but who came there long before and therefore speak the local
language much better than they.
"And as the capacity for being-discernment is generally atrophied in
contemporary beings, and they lack what is called a 'wide being-horizon,' they
take all this as French, and afterward, when they return to their respective
com



munities, they tell their compatriots about everything they have seen, heard,
and experienced in that part of Paris as if it were purely of French origin and
only the French had a hand in it.
"In this way, an opinion about the French is gradually formed in other
beings that is not at all corresponding to reality.
"Moreover, there is still another and deeper cause for this opinion about
the beings of France formed in the strange consciousness of the beings of
other communities, and it also is based on one of the peculiarities of their
common psyche This peculiarity is due once again to that maleficent practice
invented by themselves which they call 'education. '
"The point is that from the very first day of a child's appearance on 'God's
earth,' as they express it, while Nature herself is still developing this prime
conception of a future three-brained responsible being, your favorites begin to
hinder this development by this same maleficent 'education' of theirs.
"And that is not all by their pernicious practice of 'educating,' they stuff
and hammer into the 'spetsitooalitivian concentrations' or, as they would say,
the 'brains' of these newly born beings, all kinds of ephemeral and fantastic
ideas These brains are in general localized in beings for the perception and
accumulation of all kinds of impressions and of the results of conscious
being-awareness, and among the newly born they are still quite pure and
receptive to the highest degree.
"The greatest misfortune for your favorites is that this maleficent process
continues for most of them almost up to the age when they should already be
responsible beings.
"And the result of all this produces that peculiarity of their common
psyche I mentioned, which consists in the following first, almost all of their
functions intended for active being-manifestation adapt themselves little by
little to re



sponding only to the sum of these false and fantastic ideas, and second, the
whole presence of each of them gradually becomes accustomed to perceiving
all new impressions without the least participation of the being-factors that
Nature puts into beings for new perceptions—in other words, to perceiving
new impressions only according to the false and fantastic notions that have
previously been inculcated in them.
"The contemporary three-brained beings there ultimately lose even the
very need for grasping in its entirety everything they see or hear for the first
time, so that what is newly seen and newly heard merely serves as a shock,
arousing associations based on information previously implanted in them and
corresponding to these new impressions.
"Thus, when these favorites of yours become responsible beings,
everything they see or hear for the first time is perceived automatically
without any effort whatsoever on the part of their essence-functions, and
without evoking in them, as I have already said, the slightest being-need to
sense and understand whatever is going on inside or outside of them.
"In a word, they are satisfied merely with what someone else at one time
or another, consciously or unconsciously, has put into them.
"I hope, my dear boy, that after all I have just told you, it will become clear to
you why, among the three-brained beings of the other groups on your planet,
data for an opinion so uncorresponding to reality have been crystallized re
garding the beings of that separate community known as 'France.'
"Be that as it may, it is a great misfortune for the ordinary beings of France
that the contemporary three-brained beings of other groups have selected the
capital of this community for their so-called 'cultural manifestations.'



"At any rate, I personally pity the ordinary beings of this community with
all my essence, now that their capital, even though only a certain part of it, has
come to be considered the 'center of culture' of the whole planet.
"It is even astonishing that most of the beings of the community of France,
in spite of the quite abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence, due to
their capital having unfortunately become the chief 'center of culture' for the
whole of that ill-fated planet, were able to preserve in their presences,
however unconsciously, those data for the two being-impulses on which,
above all, objective morality is based, and which are called 'patriarchality' or
'love of family,' and 'organic shame.'
"Since this contemporary 'center of culture' has long been the gathering
place for beings from all over the planet who have completely given
themselves up to the 'evil god' holding absolute dominion in each of them,
namely, to the 'evil god' that has become their ideal and is very well described
in the words—'to attain a complete absence of the need for being-effort and
for any essence-anxiety about anything whatever'—these beings must of
course, consciously or unconsciously, have a harmful influence on the beings
of the whole community of France.
"You will understand very well, my boy, what a misfortune it is for the
ordinary beings of France that the present-day center of culture lies within
their community if I tell you about one of the consequences of this I learned
about it from information communicated to me in one of the latest
etherograms concerning the three-centered beings of your planet.
"I must tell you that when these beings, who have completely given
themselves up to their 'inner evil god,' flock to one of these 'centers of culture,'
they occupy themselves—among their other harmful actions, simply out of
idleness and to satisfy their whims—with devising new



forms of manifesting their hasnamussian properties or, as is said there, with new 'fashions,' which they then spread all over the planet. "This hasnamussian practice of 'devising new fashions' existed in former civilizations also, during the Tikliamishian civilization it nourished under the name of 'adiat,' and in the Babylonian period, under the name of 'haidia.' " 'Adiat,' 'haidia,' or 'fashion' consists in devising new means of beingmanifestation for ordinary existence, and various methods of changing and disguising the reality of one's presence. 'Adiat,' 'haidia,' or 'fashion' play the same role in their daily beingexistence as those customs of ours which are established to alleviate the inevitable external conditions independent of beings, customs that gradually enter into use everywhere as an essential need These contemporary customs or 'fashions' of theirs, on the other hand, are first merely temporary and serve only for the satisfaction of the insignificant personal aims of these present and future hasnamusses, which have become utterly abnormal and trivially egoistic, and second, they are neither more nor less than the results of automatic reasoning based on relative notions flowing from the abnormally established conditions of ordinary being-existence there. "And so about half a century ago, in this city of Paris, certain candidates for hasnamuss invented the fashion for beings of the female sex to wear their hair short, and this maleficent invention of theirs spread like wildfire by the usual well-proven ways and means. "However, as at that period the feelings of 'morality' and 'patriarchality' were still very strong in the beings of the female sex of the community of France, they did not adopt this harmful invention, it was the beings of the female sex of England and America who adopted it, and began cutting their hair.



"Moreover, as the beings of the female sex of both these communities thus
deliberately deprived themselves of that part of their presence which is
adapted for certain exchanges of cosmic substances, Great Nature did not fail
to react and began to produce corresponding results, which will assuredly take
such forms as have already arisen twice on this planet the first time, in the
country of 'Uneano,' now 'Kafiristan,' where what are called 'Amazons'
appeared, and the second time in ancient Greece, where the 'religion of the
poetess Sappho' was founded.
"Meanwhile, in these two contemporary communities of England and
America, the cutting of women's hair has already produced in the first case
'suffragettes,' and in the second, what are called 'Christian Scientists' and
'theosophists ' Moreover, when this hasnamussian fashion of cutting the hair
of female beings became widespread, a proportionate increase was observed
everywhere—as I was informed by the etherogram I received—in what they
call 'women's diseases,' that is, various sorts of inflammation of the sexual
organs, such as 'vaginitis,' 'uteritis,' 'ovaritis,' as well as 'fibrous tumors' and
'cancer. '
"And so, my boy, although this 'fashion' of cutting the hair of beings of the
female sex, invented in Paris by beings with hasnamussian properties, did not
at first catch on in the community of France, yet, since their capital had be
come the general rendezvous of beings with such properties, who went on
spreading this harmful invention, these latter have ultimately succeeded in
implanting it there And so the beings of the female sex in France have
likewise begun to cut their hair, and at the present time this haircutting is in
full swing for nearly all of them At the hairdressers in Paris, as I was informed
in this etherogram, they have to wait their turn exactly as people did not long
ago in the community of Russia to receive 'American flour ' And this
contagious



rush of women to the hairdressers to get their hair cut has already given rise to court actions between these hairdressers and the fathers, husbands, and brothers of these 'shorn lambs,' and even to many 'divorces,' as they are called. "It is interesting to note that the judges there, as was also communicated in that etherogram, in each case acquitted the hairdressers, on the ground that the beings of the female sex who had gone to them were over sixteen years of age, and therefore, under the laws of that country, had reached their majority and were free to do as they pleased. "But, of course, if these French judges, and in general the judges of the whole planet, knew that there exists in the Universe a definite law regarding all formations, without exception, which serve the great Trogoautoegocrat for the transformation of cosmic substances, they would undoubtedly have a completely different understanding of the concept expressed by the word 'majority. ' "The point is that, according to that definite cosmic law, during the transformation of cosmic substances all such individuals, among whom are the keschapmartnian beings of the female sex, are the sources of all those active elements which by their fusion in subsequent cosmic formations must serve in the process of the great holy law of Triamazikamno as its second holy force, in other words, these beings are always the 'negative' or 'passive principle. ' "And so, owing to this cosmic law, these sources transforming the active elements that serve as the passive principle can never be free to have any independent manifestations Only those sources can have this independence which transform the active elements that should serve as the 'Holy Affirming' or 'active principle' of the holy Triamazikamno. "That is why the sources that serve as the passive principle cannot be
responsible for their manifestations, that is, they cannot be, as they say, 'major.'



"Speaking of these French beings, I must also tell you, in order to characterize
them more fully, that the members of the 'ruling class' there invented a very
good means for 'calming' the minds of the ordinary beings of that community,
which they employ just as the power-possessing beings of the large
community of Russia employ their means of encouraging the use of the
famous 'vodka,' and as do the power-possessing beings of present-day
England with their no less famous 'sport. '
"However, although the power-possessing beings of the community of
France also successfully apply these 'good means' for the attainment of their
egoistic aims, it must be admitted—no offense to the power-possessing beings
of England and Russia—that these means of theirs do scarcely any harm to
the planetary bodies of the ordinary beings.
"Nor is this all with these means they unconsciously bring a certain benefit
to the ordinary beings of their community, by diverting them and giving them
temporary relief from the ill effects of their obsession with 'fashion,' which
was invented, as I already told you, by the present and future hasnamusses
gathered in their capital from various countries, and which now enslave the
ordinary beings of France even more than the beings of all other communities.
"These 'good means' are called 'fairs,' and at the present time these fairs are
held in the principal squares of all their towns and villages in turn, in just
those squares where, about two centuries ago, the three-brained beings used to
meet for discussions of what they call 'religious and moral topics.'
"In all justice it must be said, my boy, that these French 'fairs' are very,
very amusing places .
"I confess that even I liked to visit them and pass an hour or two there,
thinking about nothing.
"At these French fairs everything is cheap, everything is marvelous.



"For instance, for a trifling fifty centimes, everyone can 'whirl' himself
giddy on what are called 'pigs,' 'chameleons,' 'whales,' and so forth, and on
various new American and non-American inventions designed for producing
stupor.
"And if a being recovers too quickly from all these 'stupefactions' he can
then, for only a few more centimes, treat himself to something very tasty,
often prepared right on the spot.
"It is true that after these dainties, the beings, as far as their stomachs are
concerned, often become . . . h'm h'm . . . but what is this compared to the
pleasure they had in eating them?
"And in case one of the ordinary beings there wishes to 'try his luck,' as
they say, then for another few centimes he can satisfy this desire in a
thousand ways, for these famous French 'fairs' offer every attraction known
on the planet Earth for gambling or for fun—in a word, everything from the
'roulette of Monte Carlo' to the game of 'snipsnapsnorum.'



CHAPTER 38
Religion
BEELZEBUB continued as follows "Now I shall also explain to you a little
about that 'stumbling block' which was one of the chief causes of the gradual
dilution of the psyche of these unfortunate favorites of yours, namely, the
peculiar 'havatviernonis' which they always have there, and the totality of
whose action and effect on the common presence of beings they call
'religiousness.'
"This factor, arch-maleficent in the objective sense, which gradually brings
about an automatic dwindling of their psyche, arose on that ill-starred planet
when various consequences of the properties of always the same for them
accursed organ kundabuffer began to be crystallized in them, and afterward,
passing through different outer forms, began to be transmitted from
generation to generation.
"Thanks to these crystallizations, there began to be acquired in the
common presence of certain terrestrial three-brained beings the first germs of
what are called 'hasnamussian properties' and, in keeping with their egoistic
aims, they invented for the confusion of their fellow beings various fictions,
among which were all kinds of fantastic 'religious teachings ' And when
others of your favorites began to have faith in these fantastic 'religious
teachings' and, thanks to the same crystallizations, gradually lost their 'sane
mentation,' from then on there arose in the process of the ordinary existence
of these strange three-brained beings a large number of 'havatviernonis,' or
'religions,' having nothing in common with each other.
"Although these numerous 'havatviernonis,' or 'religions, ' have absolutely
nothing in common, they are all built



upon religious teachings, which in turn are based solely on that, in the
objective sense, maleficent idea that your favorites call 'Good and Evil ' This
idea, which strictly speaking was the chief factor in the gradual dilution of
their psyche, has quite recently been the cause of grave events among the
blissful 'highest being-bodies' or, as they are called there, 'souls,' who dwell
on that holy planet toward which we are falling at the present moment.
"I must not fail to tell you, my boy, the history of the events that recently
happened on this Holy Planet Purgatory, first of all because they have a
common-cosmic character and are connected with the individuality of every
relatively independent responsible Individual, and second, because certain
members of our 'genealogical tree' were the involuntary cause of these events.
"But I shall relate this story only at the end of my present tale, and I have a
very good reason for this, connected with the development of your being
mentation.
"Meanwhile bear in mind that among these terrestrial three-brained beings
who please you, there have always existed and there still exist all kinds of
'religious doctrines' on the basis of which they build up their innumerable
'religions,' and these doctrines usually arise in the following way:
"I have already told you that, owing to the unforeseeingness of certain
Most High, Sacred Cosmic Individuals, the consequences of the properties of
the organ kundabuffer, which they invented and later removed, began to be
crystallized in the common presence of these unfortunates, making it almost
impossible for them to be perfected to the degree of Being proper to three
brained beings Thereupon, our Abundantly Loving Common Father
condescended to direct these same Sacred Individuals to actualize more often
in the common presence of certain terrestrial beings the germ of a Sacred
Individual, so that these beings, having



been completely formed up to responsible age and acquiring Reason in the
conditions already fixed in the general process of existence of your favorites,
would become aware of reality and indicate to the beings similar to them how
they, with their Reason, ought to guide the functioning of their separate
spiritualized parts in order to decrystallize the consequences of the properties
of the organ kundabuffer, and to succeed in destroying in themselves the
predisposition to new crystallizations.
"And so, my boy, after these terrestrial three-brained beings in whose
presences are actualized the germs of Sacred Individuals undergo the sacred
'rascooarno' or, as they say, 'when they die,' their contemporaries, in order to
remember all their indications and explanations and also to transmit them to
the beings of subsequent generations, gather them all into 'one whole,' and
this 'whole collection of indications' usually serves as the origin of every kind
of religious teaching there.
"The strangeness of the psyche of your favorites with respect to religious
teachings that arise in this way manifests itself in that, from the very
beginning, they understand 'literally' everything that has been said and
explained by these genuine Sacred Individuals actualized from Above, and
never take into account under what circumstances and for what occasion this
or that was said or explained.
"Furthermore, during the transmission from generation to generation of
these religious teachings, the meaning of which had been distorted from the
outset, these strange three-brained beings continue to adopt in regard to them
two modes of behavior which have already become fixed in their general
existence The first consists in this those beings who in the given period of the
flow of time belong to the caste called the 'ruling class' immediately hook on
to these religious teachings the 'maleficent question' formulated on this ill
starred planet as 'Religion for the State or the State.'



for Religion,' and make use of all their cunning to Juggle with the known facts
to justify their own egoistic aims And the second mode of behavior is
manifested by certain ordinary beings there who, owing to the fault of their
'producers,' have acquired in their common presence, from their very arising
as well as during their preparation for responsible age, the properties called
'psychopathy' and 'parasitism'—properties that prevent them from ever having
in themselves any data for the manifestation of any being-duty whatever So
these ordinary beings become, as it were, 'authorities' on all the trifling details
of these new religious teachings, and begin to 'peck like crows on a jackal's
carcass' at that totality—already pecked at from the beginning—of all that had
been said and indicated by the genuine Sacred Individuals intentionally
actualized from Above.
"In short, the result of these two forms of behavior, fixed in the process of
the ordinary existence of the three-brained beings of this planet—namely, the
hasnamussian manifestations of the beings of the ruling class and the
psychopathy of certain ordinary beings—is that soon after a religion is
founded, no matter on what doctrines it is based, your favorites always get
split up into their famous 'sects ' Consequently, in all epochs, the same thing
occurs with religions as with the countless spoken languages on this
comparatively small planet, which our highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin
referred to as a 'thousand-tongued hydra', and in the present case he would
doubtless describe it as a 'flood of titillating titillations. '
"During the period of my observations of the process of existence of your
favorites, the germs of these Sacred Individuals were actualized many times in
the common presence of certain beings and, in almost every case—with the
exception of the Most Sacred Ashiata Shiemash and everything connected
with his holy labors—when they had fulfilled the mission imposed on them
from Above, no sooner



had the process of the sacred rascooarno occurred in them than religious
teachings began to arise there in the way I described That is to say, at first
these peculiar beings collected from 'bits here and bits there' the indications
and detailed explanations of these Sacred Individuals, and made them into
'one whole' in order to remember it all themselves and also to transmit it to
subsequent generations And later, as this 'whole collection' fell into the hands
of those two types of beings I spoke of, they began, as I have expressed it, to
'peck' at all this, and then, dividing themselves up into their famous 'sects,' to
produce fantastic new religious teachings thought out by themselves, with the
result that on this planet of yours there are as many religions as there are
colors in the rainbow, and the 'same old story' starts over again.
"During recent centuries hundreds of these independent religious
teachings arose in the common process of the planetary existence of your
favorites, and all of them were based on what had survived of the totality of
indications and explanations given to them by the Sacred Individuals inten
tionally actualized from Above.
"On such surviving fragments which, in recent times, have strangely
inspired them, and from which with their bob-tailed Reason they have
borrowed ideas for inventing their newer and ever newer religious teachings,
there were based five religions which still exist today, namely
Buddhism Judaism Christianity Islam Lamaism
"About the first of these, the Buddhist religion, I have already told you
"The second, namely Judaism, was founded, as it were,



precisely on the teaching of Saint Moses, the name given to one of the genuine Sacred Individuals who, in his turn, was intentionally actualized from Above. "This Sacred Individual was actualized in the planetary body of a boy who arose in the country now called 'Egypt,' shortly after my fourth sojourn on the surface of this planet of yours. "This Sacred Individual, now called Saint Moses, accomplished a great deal for them and left them many such exact and corresponding indications for ordinary existence that, if they had adopted and applied them more or less normally, then indeed all the consequences of the properties of the maleficent organ kundabuffer might have gradually been decrystallized, and even the predisposition for new crystallizations might have been destroyed. "But to the common misfortune of all the three-centered beings of our Great Universe, whatever their degree of Reason, his followers, as was already proper to them, began to mix into all the counsels and indications of this 'normality-loving' Saint Moses such a mass of what may be called 'spices' that the saintly author himself could not, with the best will in the world, have recognized anything of his own in this 'hodge-podge. ' "Your favorites of the very first generation after the contemporaries of Saint Moses evidently found it profitable, for their special aims, to insert into his religious teaching almost the entire fantastic doctrine which I have already described in my tale about the three-brained beings of the second group on the continent of Ashhark, now called 'Asia,' and which was invented by the king named Koniutsion—later a saint—for the purpose of saving his subjects from the pernicious habit of chewing the seeds of the poppy. "After Saint Moses, that Sacred Individual was sent from Above who laid
the foundations of the religion which your contemporary favorites call
'Christianity.'



"That Sacred Individual, whom they call Jesus Christ, was actualized in the
planetary body of a boy of the race of terrestrial three-brained beings which
Saint Moses, by command from Above, chose from among the beings
inhabiting the country of Egypt and led to the 'Land of Canaan. '
"After this Jesus, there were actualized, also on the continent of Asia, two
other Sacred Individuals on whose teachings the beings there founded two of
the enumerated religions that still exist to this day.
"One of these two Sacred Individuals was Saint Muhammad, who appeared
among the 'Arabs,' and the other, Saint Lama, who appeared among the beings
dwelling in the country named 'Tibet. '
"At the present time, the first of the five religious teachings I mentioned,
namely Buddhism, is found chiefly among the beings dwelling in the country
of 'India,' the former 'Pearl-land,' and in the countries called 'China' and 'Japan.'
"The followers of the second religious teaching, namely Judaism, are now
scattered over the whole planet.
"In this place in my tales it will do no harm to explain the reason why the
followers of the teaching of this Moses are so widely scattered, as this will
help you understand one peculiar property of the organ kundabuffer, the one
which evokes the feeling called 'envy', and you will also understand how each
property of this organ, no matter how small, may be the cause of very serious
consequences.
"The point is that the beings who professed the teaching of this Moses had
organized themselves very well in their community at that time, and therefore
this property called 'envy' began to be crystallized in relation to them in the
psyche of the beings of all the other communities of that period.
"And so strongly was this property crystallized in them that even after
many of their centuries had passed, when the Jewish community had already
ceased to be organized and



powerful, and had come to an end—as occurs there to all powerful
communities according to law—this attitude of the beings of other
communities toward the descendants of the Jewish community not only did
not change but in most of your favorites the feeling of 'envy' toward them even
became organic.
"The third religion, founded on the teaching of Jesus Christ, soon spread so
widely in its original form that almost a third of all the three-centered beings
of this planet became its followers.
"But before long they also began to mistreat this religious teaching based
on 'resplendent Love,' and transformed it into something equally resplendent,
but now, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin says, into a 'resplendent
terasakhaboora from the kesbaadji fairytale. '
"Furthermore, it turned out that the followers of this great religious
teaching split up, on account of some unimportant external details, into
various sects, and were no longer called just 'Christians,' as were the first
followers of this teaching, but 'Orthodox,' 'Zevrodox,' 'Ypsylodox,'
'Hamilodox,' and various other cognomens also ending in 'dox. '
"And into this teaching of truth and verity they also began, for various
egoistic and political reasons, to mix fragments taken from other 'religious
teachings' already existing there—fragments that not only had nothing in
common with the teaching of Jesus but sometimes even flatly contradicted the
truths revealed by this divine teacher.
"They mixed into it a great deal from the teaching of Saint Moses, which
by that time had been thoroughly distorted, and much later, during the period
that contemporary beings there call the 'Middle Ages,' the so-called 'Fathers
of the Church' inserted into this Christian religion nearly the whole of that
fantastic doctrine invented long ago in the city of Babylon by those learned
beings belonging to the school of the dualists, about which I have already told
you.



"The 'Fathers of the Church' in the Middle Ages probably concocted this mixture for the benefit of their own 'shops' and the 'shops' of their assistants, because of the famous 'Paradise' and 'Hell' contained in that doctrine. "So at the present time, in place of the teaching of the divine teacher Jesus Christ, which revealed the power of the All-lovingness and All-Forgivingness of our Creator suffering for beings, a teaching now exists that our Creator torments the souls of His followers. " "Dear and kind Grandfather, explain to me, please, what is meant by 'Fathers of the Church'?" asked Hassein. "They give the name of 'Fathers of the Church' to those beings there who become professional dignitaries of the highest rank of any 'religious teaching '
After this laconic reply, Beelzebub continued: "By the way, I should tell you here that the teaching of Jesus Christ was preserved unchanged among a rather small group of terrestrial beings and, passing from generation to generation, has even come down to the present day in its original form. "This small group of terrestrial beings is called the 'Brotherhood of the Essenes.' The members of this brotherhood first succeeded in introducing the teaching of this divine teacher into their own being-existence, and then in transmitting it to later generations as a very good means of freeing themselves from the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer. "The fourth great religion existing there today arose several centuries after the Christian religion and was founded on the teaching of the 'full-of-hope' Saint Muhammad At first it spread there widely, and might eventually have become a 'hearth of hope and reconciliation' for all of them if these strange beings had not also stirred this up into a 'hodge-podge.'
"On the one hand, its followers mixed into it some of the



fantastic theories of the Babylonian dualists, and on the other, the 'Fathers of
the Church' of this religion, in this case called 'Islamic sheikhs,' invented and
added to it many things about the blessings of that famous Paradise suppos
edly existing in the 'other world'—blessings such as could never have entered
the head of the chief governor of Purgatory, His All-Quarters Maintainer the
Arch-Cherub Helkgematios, even if he had deliberately tried to imagine them.
"Although the followers of this religion also split up, from the very first,
into many different 'sects' and 'sub-sects'— which, by the way, continue to
exist even till now—they nevertheless all subscribe to one or the other of its
two independent 'schools,' as they are called, which were formed at the time
of its arising.
"These two schools of the Islamic religion are called there 'Sunnism' and 'Shi'ism.' "It is interesting to note that the psychic hatred of each other formed in the
beings belonging to these two independent branches of one and the same
religion has now, on account of their frequent clashes, been completely trans
formed into organic hatred.
"During recent centuries the beings of certain European communities have
greatly contributed by their intrigues to this peculiar transformation of that
strange being-function.
"And they make use of these intrigues again and again to increase the
animosity between the followers of these two independent schools of one and
the same religion so that they should never unite, for if this were to happen
there might soon be an end of those European communities.
"The point is that nearly half of the three-brained beings there are
followers of this Islamic teaching, and only as long as this hatred prevails
among them will they constitute no serious threat of 'reciprocal destruction' to
European communities.
"And hence the power-possessors of certain 'freshly



baked' communities that have accidentally arisen always rub their hands and
rejoice when sparks fly between these Sunnis and Shi'ites, because they may
then count on a long and secure existence for themselves.
"Now as regards the fifth teaching, the teaching of the Sacred Individual
called Saint Lama, who was also a genuine Messenger from our Endlessness,
this teaching was spread only among those three-brained beings there who,
because of their geographical location, scarcely ever came in contact with
other beings of this ill-starred planet, and in consequence were scarcely
affected by the abnormally established conditions of ordinary being-existence
there.
"One part of this teaching was also soon changed and even destroyed by its
followers, but the other part entered more or less into the existence of this
little group of beings and began to produce the expected results Thanks to this
the hope grew, even among the highest Sacred Individuals, that this teaching,
created by the saintly labors of Saint Lama, might one day accomplish what
had become a necessity in the Megalocosmos for everything that exists
"But your favorites did not allow this to happen and by their 'military
expedition' or 'Anglo-Tibetan war,' without so much as a thought they
knocked this possibility soundly on the head.
"I will tell you a little later about this 'military expedition. ' "And I shall tell you about it because I myself happened to be an
eyewitness of all those lamentable events there.
"But first I must tell you how they now wish, of course with the help of the
'Swivel-eyed General,' to 'wipe out' even the remnants of the two religions
still existing on your planet that, although changed beyond recognition, have
nevertheless during the last centuries made the ordinary existence of your
favorites, though very remotely, yet all the same a tiny bit more like the
existence of the three-brained beings breeding on the other planets of our
Great Uni



verse—and, for certain of them, have rendered their fantastically haphazard existence somewhat more tolerable in the objective sense. "Namely, I shall describe how there is actually now proceeding the final 'dispatch' of two of the five great religions I mentioned, which were founded, though 'from bits here and there,' nevertheless on the teachings of genuine Messengers of our Endlessness Himself the one, on the teaching of Saint Jesus, and the other, on the teaching of Saint Muhammad. "I repeat that these great religions were founded on bits taken here and
there from the teachings of two genuine Messengers of His Endlessness and,
although the three-brained beings of former centuries stripped both these
teachings, as 'the Russian Sidor stripped his goats,' nevertheless it was owing
to these teachings that some of them, even down to the present time, believed
in something and hoped for something, whereby their desolate existence was
made a little more bearable.
"But these contemporary, arch-strange three-brained beings there have taken it upon themselves to sweep even these last traces off the face of their planet. "Although this process arising from the strangeness of their psyche,
namely, the process of the final destruction of these two great religions, began
after my departure from their solar system, nevertheless, thanks to an
etherogram about the beings of that peculiar planet which I received just
before our flight from the planet Karatas, I understand what is going on there
and can now say with complete conviction that they will not stop at stripping
them, but without further ado will entirely destroy their last traces.
"This etherogram, by the way, informed me that on your planet, first, a university for Jewish youths was being opened in the city of Jerusalem, and second, an order had been promulgated in the community of Turkey closing all the



'dervish monasteries' and prohibiting men from wearing the 'fez,' and women, the 'yashmak. ' "The first half of the message—about the opening of a university for
Jewish youths in the city of Jerusalem—made it clear to me that the Christian
religion also had already come to an end.
"But to understand this, you should know that not so long ago all the
communities on the continent of Europe, whose inhabitants are for the most
part followers of this religion, waged their great wars against the followers of
other religions on account of this city of Jerusalem, and they called these wars
the 'Crusades.'
"They carried on these 'wars' or 'crusades' for the sole purpose of making
this city, where the divine teacher Jesus Christ had existed, suffered, and died,
exclusively Christian, and during these crusades of theirs nearly half the
beings of male sex of that continent perished.
"But today in this same city of Jerusalem, they have opened a
contemporary university for Jewish youths, almost certainly with the common
consent of all the European Christian communities.
"Those people are called 'Jewish' among whom the divine Jesus appeared
and existed, and whose beings tortured and crucified him on a cross.
"Although the present generation of Jews are not outright enemies of Jesus
Christ, nonetheless each of them now holds the conviction that this Jesus who
appeared among their ancestors and became a sacred personality for all the
followers of the Christian religion was nothing but an 'impulsive and sick
visionary.
"Among contemporary beings of the planet Earth, a 'university' is just that
'hearth' on which everything acquired by preceding generations during tens of
centuries is burned, and on this 'hearth' a 'half-day tasty lentil soup' is quickly
cooked to take the place of everything attained through cen



tunes of the conscious and unconscious efforts and labors of their unfortunate ancestors. "This is quite enough to convince me in my whole being of what will
eventually become of this Jerusalem, now that they have opened one of their
famous universities there and, moreover, for Jewish youths.
"I already see in my mind's eye that, before many of their years have
passed, on the spot where the planetary body of the divine Jesus was buried
there will be a parking lot for contemporary cars, that is, a place for those
'mechanical marvels' which were just what was needed to drive the con
temporary beings insane.
"Indeed, these sacrilegious beings have not only gradually distorted the
doctrine of this divine teacher for their egoistic and political aims, but they are
now destroying even his memory.
"But after all, this has long been the style of your favorites. "I may say in passing that the whole of contemporary 'civilization' there
tends only to increase the speed of this machine they have invented, which is
so maleficent for them.
"In fact, in the last etherogram I received about your favorites I was
informed among other things that they had already established with one of
these machines a 'record speed' of 325 miles an hour.
"Of course, the only result of such a 'record' will be that the already rather
meager size of their ill-fated planet will become completely trifling, even to
their bob-tailed being-picturings of reality.
"Well, may the Lord Creator be with them, my boy! "Whatever speed they attain with these 'machines' of theirs, all the same, as
long as they remain as they are, neither they themselves nor even their thought
will ever go beyond their atmosphere.
"Now as regards the second great religion which, as I have already told you, was founded upon 'bits here and bits



there' taken from the teaching of the full-of-hope Saint Muhammad—this
religion, from its very beginning, was particularly made use of by beings with
hasnamussian properties for their egoistic and political aims, and hence it is
the most 'stripped' of all.
"The power-possessing beings of certain communities began to 'season'
this divine teaching, for their hasnamussian aims, with such 'spices' of their
own invention that a 'sherakhoorian concoction' was produced, the secret of
which would be the envy of all the famous contemporary European 'pastry
cooks' and 'chefs.'
"And so . . . "Judging by the latter part of this etherogram, the process of the total
destruction of this second great religion is bound to start or has already done
so, on account of the order promulgated by the power-possessing beings of
the community of Turkey.
"The point is that this community of Turkey is one of the largest
communities there whose beings profess this religion.
"I must first tell you that from the beginning of the Islamic religion, certain
beings of this community took in this teaching in its original form very well
and gradually incorporated it into their daily existence, just as the Essene
brethren had done with the Christian doctrine.
"And therefore, although the Islamic religion was gradually changed under
the influence of the power-possessors there, yet among the particular beings I
have mentioned its teaching passed from generation to generation in an un
changed form.
"So until now there has remained at least a faint hope that, if one day the
strange beings of the planet Earth should suddenly settle down a little, this
teaching would come back to life and actualize the aims for which it was
created by the full-of-hope Saint Muhammad.



"But alas, my boy! . . . The beings who had assimilated this teaching were called 'dervishes,' and it was about the closing of just these dervish monasteries that the order was given in the contemporary community of Turkey. "Of course, by the abolition of this 'dervishism' those last dying sparks will also be entirely extinguished which, preserved like embers in the ashes, might one day have rekindled that hearth of possibilities which Saint Muhammad had counted upon and for which he had hoped. "And as regards the other decree mentioned in that etherogram and promulgated in the community of Turkey, forbidding beings of the male sex to wear the once famous 'fez,' and the beings of the female sex the 'yashmak,' the consequences of these innovations are very clearly depicted in my beingpicturings of the future. "Thanks to these innovations, there is no doubt that exactly the same thing will happen in Turkey as happened to the beings of the large community of Russia after they also began to imitate everything European. "For example, only one or two centuries ago, before the beings of that
large community of Russia had begun copying everything European, there
still existed there the two being-functions called 'martaadamlik' and
'namusslik' or, as they are still called, 'religious feeling' and the 'feeling of
patriarchality.'
"And it was owing to these being-feelings that a couple of centuries ago the beings of that large community were famous among other beings of the whole planet for their morality and the patriarchal foundations of their family life. "But afterward, when they began imitating everything European, both these being-feelings still present in them began to atrophy little by little, and nowadays, in almost all the beings of that community, religious feeling and the feeling of patriarchality have become something or other which



our wise teacher Mullah Nasr Eddin expresses merely by the exclamation:
" 'Ekh . . . be off with you!' "In Russia, moreover, this did not start with the 'yashmak' or the 'fez.'
"No, these headdresses were not worn there. "It began with the 'beard' of the beings of the male sex. For them, the
'beard' represents the same thing as our tail, which, as you know, contributes
to the masculinity and activity of the beings of the male sex among us.
"Now it is the turn of these unfortunate Turks. "Once they have started to exchange the 'fez' for European 'bowlers,' the
rest will follow of itself.
"Doubtless the psyche of these Turkish beings will soon degenerate, as did
the psyche of the beings of the community of Russia.
"The only difference is that in the case of the Russians a single being,
namely their tsar, was the cause of this transformation of their psyche,
whereas for the community of Turkey, several beings were responsible.
"The point is, these Turks recently changed their centuries-old state
organization for a new one, a certain special 'republican' form, and instead of
having one ruler, as in the old established organization, they now have
several.
"That former state organization of theirs may have been bad, but at least
there was only one ruler, whose rare innovations for his community were all
of a patriarchal character.
"But now in this community of Turkey there are several leaders, and each
of them wiseacres and imposes his callow ideas upon the unfortunate ordinary
beings there—ideas not corresponding at all either to the long-since
crystallized needs of the psyche of the beings of this community or to the
established pillars of their being-morality.
"It is also interesting to note that, just as formerly the



Russian tsar was supplied by his nearest old patriarchal functionaries with
large quantities of what is called 'money' obtained by the sweat of the
peasants, and was sent to the continent of Europe to study many different
methods of government in various communities there, in order that when he
came home he might the better orient himself in the ruling of his community,
so these present-day callow Turkish rulers were likewise provided by their
own 'patriarchal' fathers with a great deal of money, this time obtained by the
sweat of the 'khaivansanansakoffs,' and also were sent to the continent of
Europe to get what they call a 'good education' for the future welfare of their
fatherland.
"Well, my boy, in both these cases, because the future rulers of these two
large, highly populated communities were sent to the continent of Europe
quite young, before becoming aware of their responsibility, and above all
because they were well provided with money from the sources I mentioned,
the manner of existence of the beings on the continent of Europe was
absorbed and permanently crystallized in them as so splendiferous and
beneficial that when later, on account of the abnormally established conditions
of existence in their countries, they became the leaders of these communities
of many millions, they could not help but aim to make the existence of their
compatriots as 'happy,' according to their bob-tailed notions, as that of the
Europeans .
"The present rulers of the contemporary community of Turkey, by the way,
saw and absorbed many good things in the community of Germany, where
they were sent to study what is called 'militarism'—that is, the special subtle
ties for directing the processes of reciprocal destruction.
"That is why they existed for a long time in that community of Germany
and for a number of years were what are known as 'German Junkers '
"And what they found best they saw and absorbed in



the capital, Berlin, along the avenue called 'Unter den Linden.' "I do not yet know what future benefits these new Turkish rulers will
bestow on their compatriots, but meanwhile, they have already done for their
fatherland one 'highly patriotic deed. '
"To understand the essence of this patriotic deed, you must first know that
in the capital of Turkey, in the streets and alleys of the quarters called 'Galata'
and 'Pera,' all the female beings of a 'special designation' used to belong to
foreign communities, though these women earned and spent 'genuine Turkish
lira.'
"But thanks to the recent innovations, the Turks now have the firm hope
that soon these 'genuine patriotic lira' of theirs will cease to be at the disposal
of the female beings of any alien community but will pass solely to their own
'dear she-compatriots.'
"It is not for nothing that our highly esteemed Hadji Nasr Eddin says:
'The most important thing is to have plenty of money, and then even our
"namuss" may crack.
"Or sometimes, in such cases, he says in Turkish 'Duniam ishi, pakmazli
pishi, geyann purnundah pussar eshahi dishi,' which means in English: 'The
affairs of the world are like honey-cakes, and whoever eats them grows an
ass's tooth. '
"Now let me tell you in a little more detail, as I promised, about the teaching
of the last Sacred Individual, Saint Lama, who appeared among the beings of
Tibet, and about the causes of the total destruction of that teaching also.
"As I already told you, the doctrine and preaching of this saint were not so
widely spread because of the geographical conditions of the locality where he
appeared and where he also taught those unfortunate three-centered beings
what



they had to do to free themselves from the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer. "On account of the geographical conditions of this country, the beings
there were little in touch with the abnormal conditions of ordinary being
existence of the beings of other communities, and as certain of them were
more receptive to the teaching of this last Sacred Individual, it gradually
entered into their essence and began to be actualized in practice also.
"So, my boy, for many years circumstances were such in that country
called 'Tibet' that the local beings came to be grouped according to the degree
of their inner transubstantiation of the teaching of this Saint Lama, and
according to the degree of their need to work upon themselves, and organizing
their ordinary existence in a corresponding way, they had the possibility,
thanks to their isolation due to the inaccessibility of their country to
foreigners, of working unhindered, according to the instructions of Saint
Lama, on their liberation from the consequences of the properties of that
organ which, to their common misfortune, had been implanted in their earliest
ancestors.
"Among these beings, certain of them had already attained this liberation,
many others were on the path toward this attainment, while still others had the
firm hope of one day also reaching this path.
"But just when the conditions and environment for productive work had at
last taken a definite turn in the right direction in Tibet, that event occurred
through which the possibility for the beings of this country of one day freeing
themselves from the misfortune oppressing them was completely destroyed or,
at any rate, again delayed for many years.
"But before I tell you about what happened there, you should know
something else.



"Only a few centuries ago, the chief particularity of your favorites on the
planet Earth, namely, the process of their periodic 'reciprocal destruction,'
used to take place between beings of different communities on one and the
same continent, and if, exceptionally, this process occurred between beings of
different continents, it was only between groups dwelling along the common
borders of two adjacent continents And this was because travel by sea was
still very difficult for terrestrial beings some centuries ago.
"But after a contemporary being there had by chance discovered the
possibility of using the power of artificially rarefied water or, as they say,
'steam,' for such locomotion, and had devised suitable vessels for that purpose,
these terrestrial beings began to travel for these maleficent processes to the
coasts of nearby continents or even to more distant ones.
"During the last century, on one of these continents, a favorite dwelling
place of the beings of this peculiar planet was the country of ancient Pearl
land or, as contemporary beings call it, 'India. '
"Do you remember that I once told you how beings of the continent of
Atlantis used to sail to that self-same Pearl-land on the continent of Ashhark,
now called 'Asia,' to search for pearls, and how later it was they who first
populated that country?
"So, my boy . . . "This unfortunate Pearl-land, or India, has also become during recent
centuries the favorite place of the contemporary beings of the continent of
Europe, but this time for their processes of reciprocal destruction.
"Arriving there by sea, they began to carry on their processes of reciprocal
destruction, both among themselves and with the beings breeding there, that
is, the beings of one European community tried to destroy the existence of
beings of another European community, or these processes



took place between beings of that locality, with the European beings helping one side or the other. "The processes of reciprocal destruction of local character were very frequent in that hapless Pearl-land, especially during the last ten or fifteen centuries. "And this was because after one of those great processes the beings of that
country, who had formerly belonged to only two different communities, were
split into a great number of small independent ones, and also because a certain
combination was produced in their common psyche, whereby 'outbursts' of the
striving for reciprocal destruction occurred in the beings on that part of the
surface of the planet Earth, not all at once but at different times.
"And this new combination in their common psyche was also produced
thanks to a slight unforeseen misunderstanding connected with the 'common
harmonic movement' of the whole of that solar system.
"Some day I will explain to you the details of that misunderstanding.
"Meanwhile let us return to our story. "So . . .
"That part of the surface of the planet Earth called 'India' has remained a
source of natural wealth in recent centuries, as it was before.
"And therefore when, in the strange psyche of the European beings who
had gone to that country to take part in the process of reciprocal destruction,
the need to carry on this 'horror' had passed, they stayed on there either to pre
pare themselves for subsequent processes or, as they say, to 'earn enough' to
send to their families who had remained on the continent of Europe what was
required for their ordinary existence.
"And they 'earned' all sorts of 'riches' there by trading for the most part in manufactured goods called 'copper but



tons,' 'hand mirrors,' 'beads,' 'earrings,' 'bracelets,' and various other gewgaws
for which it appeared the beings of that country also had a weakness.
"From the outset of this period, the beings of the continent of Europe also
began with various subterfuges to take possession of the lands belonging to
the beings of Pearl-land and settled down there in separate groups, just as in
Europe, according to the community from which they had emigrated.
"These beings continued to manifest toward each other the kind of strange
being-relationships that exist and have always existed on the continent of
Europe between beings belonging to one community and those of another
namely, thanks to the consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer, they cultivated feelings that had been crystallized in them in the
form of particular functions known as 'envy,' 'jealousy,' 'sandoor,' that is,
'wishing for the rum or enfeeblement of others,' and so on.
"And there in Pearl-land, too, beings of one community began to trumpet
full blast against the beings of another community that 'hasnamussian music'
they call 'polities', that is, they began to criticize each other, to disparage each
other, to 'run each other down,' and so on, with the aim of creating what is
called 'prestige' for their own community among the local beings.
"In pursuing these 'politics,' one of the heads of a certain European
community somehow learned the 'secret' of influencing the psyche of beings
of other communities, so that they would acknowledge the authority and
supremacy of his own.
"Later, when this being initiated the other heads of his community into that
secret—the principle of which is called 'ksvatznell' or 'inciting one against the
other'—and they all made it the basis of their 'politics,' then indeed the beings



of this community began to gain the upper hand everywhere and in everything. "Although the former heads of this community and also that being who had hit upon the secret of 'ksvatznell' perished long ago, subsequent generations continued, automatically of course, to employ this 'secret,' and gradually not only took over almost the whole of Pearl-land but also subordinated to their influence the very essence of all the beings breeding on that part of the planet Earth. "During the period referred to in my tale concerning the destruction by contemporary beings of the labors of Saint Lama, despite the passage of two centuries, everything went on in the same way. "The recent heads of that mentioned European community who, thanks only to the secret of 'ksvatznell,' had had the luck gradually to subordinate everything to their influence and to take it all into their hands, were proud of their success and wanted to lay their 'paws' even on that which until then had been considered unattainable. "In other words, they decided to take possession of that neighboring country called 'Tibet,' then held to be inaccessible And so, one fine day'fine' for them, but a 'sorry day' for all the rest of the beings of that planetthey gathered together many beings of their community, and still more from the small local communities they had already conquered, and with the help of every new invention of contemporary 'European civilization' for the process of reciprocal destruction, they began very quietly moving up toward this country hitherto considered inaccessible. "In spite of the help of all these 'new European inventions,' this movement of theirs up the heights of this country was very difficult, and cost them dearly, not only in what they call 'pounds sterling' but also in what they call 'casualties. '
"While this assemblage of terrestrial three-brained beings



continued their slow and laborious ascent, the beings who dwelt above in
Tibet as yet suspected nothing of the 'military expedition' against their
country.
"And they learned about it only when the troops had reached the heights.
"When the beings of this high country learned of this unusual event, they
became very alarmed and agitated, because for many centuries they had been
accustomed to the notion that the place of their existence was inaccessible to
others, and that beings of other communities, no matter what their means for
the process of reciprocal destruction, would never be able to reach them.
"So certain were they of this that not even once had they cast a glance
downward to see the preparations that were being made during this time for
penetrating into their 'inaccessible' country, and hence they did not take any
corresponding measures in advance.
"And so those sorrowful events came to pass which were to destroy
forever all the results created by that full-of-faith Sacred Individual, Saint
Lama.
"First of all I must tell you that in this high country there also existed a
small group of seven beings who, according to the rule established from the
very beginning, were the guardians of the most secret instructions and
counsels of Saint Lama.
"This 'group of seven' had followed the indications of Saint Lama for
freeing themselves from the consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer, and had brought their self-perfecting up to the final degree.
"When this 'group of seven' learned what was happening, they sent their
leader to join the agitated chiefs of the whole country in a conference, which
was held in the capital on the very day of the intrusion of these uninvited
guests.
"At this first conference of theirs, the assembled heads of the Tibetan
beings unanimously decided to request these



uninvited visitors, very calmly and courteously, to be good enough to return whence they had come, and to leave undisturbed both themselves and their peaceful country that was doing no harm to anyone. "When, after a few days, it became clear that these uninvited guests would not consent to return, and as a result of this request even hastened to move more deeply into the country, the members of the first conference became still more alarmed, and arranged a second conference to deliberate what to do to prevent these beings from, as is said, 'entering a stranger's house without invitation. "All sorts of means were proposed for ridding their country of these beings who had forced their way like magpies into a stranger's nest. But one means in particular found support to destroy to the last man all these swaggering intruders. "And indeed, my boy, this could easily have been done, because such is
the nature of the country that, without any other means, merely by hurling
stones down from the mountains, a single being could destroy thousands of
enemies passing along the valleys, all the more since every one of them knew
the contours of his native country like the palm of his hand.
"Toward the close of the conference, all the leaders of the country of Tibet
were in such a state of excitement that they would almost certainly have
decided to carry out the proposal supported by the majority if the head of that
small 'group of seven,' who had been sent there by the other members, had not
intervened in this stormy debate.
"This head of the 'group of seven,' already almost a saint, in persuading the other participants in this conference to give up what they had proposed, said among other things. 'The existence of every being is equally precious and dear to God, our Common Creator, so the destruction of these beings, especially of so many of them, would give no



small grief to That One Who, even without this, is overburdened with care
and sorrow for everything that exists among us on Earth.
"All that this future saint went on to say in the assembly of Tibetan chiefs
was so persuasive that they decided not only to take no measures against the
intruders but even to take every kind of precaution that no one should hinder
the march of events.
"And so the beings who had appeared from below as 'uninvited' guests,
meeting with no opposition anywhere, moved forward into the heart of that
unique country, which had hitherto been isolated from the ever-worsening
conditions of ordinary being-existence on your planet.
"Well, it was just then that the event occurred which resulted in a great
calamity, not only for all present and future beings of this unlucky country but
perhaps even for all present and future three-brained beings of the whole of
that unfortunate planet.
"You should know that at the final conference of all the leaders of Tibet,
among other things a resolution was carried that certain members of the
council, chosen by lot, should go to those districts through which these
strangers would pass, in order to forewarn the local inhabitants of the decision
taken by their leaders, and to persuade them to permit no one, under any
circumstances, to hinder the passage of these intruders .
"Among those sent to the districts through which the armed invaders
would pass, the lot fell to the chief of this small 'group of seven. '
"And when he arrived for this purpose at a certain large center near which
the armed hordes of foreign beings had camped for a needed rest, in the street
of this place a stray bullet fired—intentionally or accidentally—by one of
these newcomers killed this future saint on the spot.
"Thus ended the existence of the chief of that small group



of nearly perfected brethren, and in spite of the terror which overwhelmed
them, nothing remained for them but to take the necessary steps for bringing
home the planetary body of their chief.
"In order that you may clearly represent to yourself the real terror of the
situation experienced by these six brothers who were left without their leader,
and also understand all the disastrous consequences of this event, I must first
of all tell you, even though briefly, the history of the rise and existence of this
small group in Tibet, which for centuries had always consisted of seven three
brained beings of your planet.
"This group was formed and existed long before the appearance on the
planet Earth of the last Sacred Individual, Saint Lama.
"At the very beginning it was composed of seven beings directly initiated
by Saint Krishnatkharna, who was also a Messenger of our Endlessness,
specially sent to the three-centered beings of the planet Earth breeding in the
country of Pearl-land.
"When Saint Buddha later appeared in Pearl-land, he ascertained that many
of Saint Krishnatkharna's instructions for the psyche of the beings of that
country were not yet obsolete, and that, if absorbed by any of them, these in
structions could help destroy those consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer—to free themselves from which he too had been sent to help
them, and he therefore decided to make some of these instructions of Saint
Krishnatkharna the basis of his own teaching And after these seven beings
who had been directly initiated by Saint Krishnatkharna were shown the aim
and necessity of their existence by Saint Buddha and clearly sensed this, and
were convinced that the instructions of Saint Buddha did not at heart
contradict the instructions of Saint Krishnatkharna, but even complemented
them and corresponded more exactly



to the psyche of the beings of that period, they became followers of Saint Buddha. "Still later, when Saint Lama appeared specially for the beings of the
country of Tibet, he found, in his turn, that many instructions of Saint Buddha
still corresponded very well with the psyche of the beings of that country,
provided certain details were modified in accordance with the changes in
external conditions of existence due to the passage of time So he also included
in the basis of his teaching many instructions from the truths already revealed
by Saint Krishnatkharna before him and renewed by Saint Buddha And once
again this small group of initiated beings, as well as other followers of Saint
Buddha, sensing clearly that the additions and changes brought to this
teaching by Saint Lama corresponded better to the contemporary psyche,
became followers of Saint Lama.
"Among the beings of this small group there was a rule which, by the way,
they observed very strictly, according to which certain secret instructions of
Saint Lama concerning the beings of their group could be transmitted from
generation to generation through their leader alone, and he could initiate the
other six into these secrets only after certain attainments on their part.
"That is why the six members of this small group, all of whom already
merited and were ready to receive initiation in the near future, were so
horrified when they learned of the destruction of their leader With the loss of
this sole initiate of that time, they were deprived forever of the possibility of
becoming initiated themselves into these secret instructions of Saint Lama.
"Owing to the fact that their leader was killed so unexpectedly, it was even
doubtful whether they could use the sole remaining possibility of receiving
these instructions by communicating with the Reason of their leader by means
of



the process of the sacred 'almtznoshinoo'—a process about which they already knew, and for which moreover they had in themselves all the required data. "But probably, my dear boy, you know nothing as yet about this sacred process? "The sacred 'almtznoshinoo' is the process by means of which certain three-centered beings, who have been able to attain the coating of their own kesdjan bodies up to completed functioning and to a definite degree of Reason, intentionally bring about the coating or, as is otherwise said, the 'materialization' of the 'kesdjan body' of a being whose planetary body has ceased to exist, up to such a density that this second body regains for a limited time the possibility of manifesting through certain functions proper to its former planetary body. "This sacred process can be carried out upon the kesdjan body of a being
who during his existence has also brought his higher being-body up to
completed functioning, and in whom the Reason of this body has been
brought up to the degree called the sacred 'being-mirotzinoo. '
"In our Great Universe, besides the process of the materialization or intentional coating of the kesdjan body of a being whose planetary body has ceased to exist, there is another process called the most sacred 'djerymetly ' And this other most sacred process consists in this first of all the highest being-body, namely, the 'body of the soul,' is intentionally coated, and only after that, as in the first case, is the sacred 'almtznoshinoo' actualized. "Of course it is possible to carry out these processes only if such higher being-bodies are still in those spheres which are in contact with the atmosphere of the planet where these 'holy sacraments' are performed. "Furthermore, these 'materializations,' evoked intentionally and consciously by certain beings, can exist, and a con



nection and communication with them can be maintained, only as long as
these beings consciously feed the kesdjan body with their own sacred
'aiëssakhladonn.'
"Thus, those six remaining members of the small 'group of seven' might
have had recourse to this same sacred process of 'almtznoshinoo' for
communicating with the Reason of their destroyed leader if they had foreseen
the possibility of his sudden disappearance, and while he was still in existence
had made a certain preparation that was indispensable for accomplishing this
process.
"In order to understand the essence of this preparation for the sacred
process of the 'sacrament of almtznoshinoo,' you need to know about two
special properties of the 'being-hanbledzoin,' that is, the 'blood' of the kesdjan
body.
"The first of these properties of the 'being-hanbledzoin' consists in this, that
if any part of it is separated and removed from the rest, then no matter where
and how far away it is taken, a sort of 'threadlike connection' is formed
between this part and the principal concentration of this cosmic substance, this
'connection' moreover is formed of the same substance, and its density and
thickness increase or diminish in proportion to the distance between the
principal concentration and this separated part.
"And the second special property of this hanbledzoin is that if a part of it is
again introduced, accidentally or intentionally, into the principal concentration
of this substance, no matter where this concentration may be, or in what
quantity the hanbledzoin is introduced, it blends with the hanbledzoin of the
original concentration and is distributed uniformly throughout it both as
regards density and quantity.
"And so, since the kesdjan body of the being is coated with substances that
in their totality make this cosmic formation much lighter than the mass of
cosmic substances composing the atmosphere surrounding the planets, the



kesdjan body is no sooner separated from the planetary body of the being than
it rises, according to the cosmic law called 'tenikdoa' or, as it is sometimes
called, the 'law of gravity,' to that sphere in which it finds the density that
corresponds with its own mass and which is thus the place corresponding to
such cosmic arisings.
"In view of all this, the preparation required for the sacrament of the sacred
almtznoshinoo consists in removing beforehand, during his planetary
existence, a part of the hanbledzoin of the being on whose kesdjan body this
sacred process is to be performed after his death, and this part must either be
kept in some corresponding surplanetary formation, or be introduced into
those beings who perform this 'ritual,' and intentionally blended with the
hanbledzoin of their own kesdjan bodies.
"Thus, when the perfected three-brained being predesignated for the
sacrament of almtznoshinoo ceases his planetary existence, and his kesdjan
body is separated from his planetary body, then, thanks to the first special
property of this being-hanbledzoin, that 'connection' I have just told you about
begins to establish itself between his kesdjan body and the place where the
part of his hanbledzoin had been preserved beforehand, or with those beings
who have intentionally coated this particle in their own kesdjan bodies.
"In order to be clear about this question in our subsequent talks, I must tell
you here that this connection—one end of which is kept in the kesdjan body
that has risen to its corresponding sphere, and the other end of which stays
either within those surplanetary formations where the part of the general mass
of the hanbledzoin was fixed, or in those beings who intentionally blended it
with the hanbledzoin of their own kesdjan body—can exist in space for only a
limited period, that is, until the planet on which the given being had arisen has
completed one revolution around its sun.



"At the beginning of a new revolution such connections completely
disappear.
"And they disappear because, in the atmosphere surrounding each planet,
the evolution and involution of the cosmic substances required for the great
cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, in accordance with the fundamental sacred cosmic
law of Heptaparaparshinokh, again commence flowing only for the
trogoautoegocratic process of local character, that is, within the limits of the
'autonomous activity' of the given solar system, and as a result, all cosmic
substances, without exception, which happen to be in the atmosphere during
the period of this revolution, including the said connections, are immediately
transformed into cosmic substances corresponding to this atmosphere.
"So, my boy! . . . "Until the end of a complete revolution, those beings existing on planets
who either have in themselves a particle of the hanbledzoin of a kesdjan body,
or have at their disposal the surplanetary formation in which a part of the
hanbledzoin was fixed, can at any time—assuming, of course, that they
possess all the corresponding data—attract such a body back to the solid part
of their planet, and by 'saturating' it to the required density with their own
hanbledzoin, can establish a contact with the Reason of that already
completely formed independent cosmic unit.
"And this 'attraction,' or 'materialization,' as it is sometimes called, is
brought about by means of what is known as 'vallikrin,' that is, by the
conscious infusion, in a certain way, of their own hanbledzoin into the ends of
these connections.
"This sacred process of almtznoshinoo had already been carried out several
times by three-centered beings on your planet at different periods even before
it was attempted in Tibet, and several legomonisms existed concerning these
sacred processes of former times.



"It was through these legomonisms that this small group of Tibetan beings
already knew all the details of the procedure relating to this sacred process,
and of course they also knew about the special preparation required for it.
"But having now no other possibility of learning all the secret instructions
than to attempt to enter into contact with the Reason of their deceased leader,
they decided to try to carry out this sacred sacrament upon his kesdjan body,
even without the said preparation.
"And this risk that they took was the cause of the great misfortune I
mentioned.
"As my further investigations showed me, this misfortune occurred in the
following way:
"Those six 'great initiates,' still existing in their planetary bodies, took
turns in pairs, for three days and nights, to carry out uninterruptedly the
process of 'vallikrin' upon the planetary body of their former leader, that is,
the infusion of their own hanbledzoïn into his body But because a connection
with his kesdjan body had not been established beforehand, their hanbledzoïn
did not accomplish what was expected but only accumulated chaotically over
his planetary body And since, unfortunately for them, an intensified blending
of the sacred active element Okidanokh was proceeding during these days in
the atmosphere above that locality or, as your favorites say, there were violent
'thunderstorms,' there took place between these two cosmic results, still in the
process of transition from one definite cosmic phenomenon to another, what
is called a 'sobrionolian' contact.
"And this contact on that small area of your ill-starred planet set in motion
the accelerated cosmic phenomenon called 'nichto-oonichtono,' that is to say,
the sudden, instantaneous evolution of all surrounding cosmic crys
tallizations—in other words, all the nearby surplanetary



formations were instantly transformed into the prime-source substance
'ethernokrilno.'
"This sobrionolian contact or, as it would be called on the planet Earth,
'explosion,' was so powerful that during this nichto-oonichtono, everything
without exception was transformed into ethernokrilno—the planetary body of
the chief of this small group as well as those of the other six brethren who
were performing this sacred sacrament, and likewise all the already
spiritualized or merely concentrated surplanetary formations within a radius
of one 'shmana' or, as your favorites would say, within about one 'square
mile.'
"Among the destroyed formations, both natural and artificial in origin,
were all the 'books' which had belonged to these seven 'great terrestrial
initiates,' and many other things used as means to keep in memory everything
concerning the three Sacred Individuals intentionally actualized from Above,
namely, Saint Krishnatkharna, Saint Buddha, and Saint Lama.
"Now, my boy, I think you will understand the meaning of those words by
which I described this charming 'military expedition' when I said that this was
a great calamity, not only for the beings of that country but perhaps also for
all the three-brained beings of the whole planet.
"So, my dear Hassein, it has doubtless become clear to you how all the five
religions I named, still existing there at the present time, founded on the
teachings of five genuine saints sent from Above to help your favorites free
themselves from the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer,
have gradually become altered, thanks as always to the abnormal conditions
of ordinary being-existence established by them, until they were finally
converted, from the point of view of any sane mentation, into children's fairy
tales— and how, nevertheless, these same religions still served some



of them as a support of those inner moral motives owing to which, during certain periods, their common existence became more or less becoming to three-centered beings. "But now, after the final destruction of the last remnants of these religions, it is difficult to foresee how it will all end. "The last of these five religions, founded on the teaching of the genuine Messenger Saint Lama, has been completely destroyed, moreover 'with a crash,' by that charming military expedition of theirs "The last but one, founded on the teachings of Saint Muhammad, they are just now destroying by the prohibition of the famous 'fez' and 'yashmak,' with the gracious assistance of the 'German Junkers.' "And as regards the religion founded still earlier on the teaching of Jesus Christ—a religion and teaching upon which the highest Individuals placed great hopes—those arch-strange three-brained beings of today are completely destroying it by organizing in the city of Jerusalem a 'university' for contemporary Jewish youth. "Although the religion founded on the teaching of Saint Moses has existed for a long time and is still maintained after a fashion by its followers, because of the organic hatred formed in the beings of the other communities toward the beings who follow this religion, and owing to the maleficent idea existing there called 'politics,' they will doubtless sooner or later finish off that religion as well, and also 'with a crash. ' "And finally, as regards that religion supposedly founded on the teaching of Saint Buddha, I already told you that, thanks to their notorious 'suffering,' based on a misunderstood idea, its followers have from the very beginning turned this teaching into a means for the 'prostitution of thought,' as is said there. "By the way, it should be noted that the first to indulge in this 'prostitution of thought' were the 'Tanguori,' then



the 'Brahmanists,' 'Shuenists,' and so on, and today the 'Theosophists' and
other 'pseudo-learned beings' busy themselves with the same thing. "
After these words, Beelzebub was silent for a few moments, and it could be
seen that he was pondering deeply over something, and then he said:
"I have this moment come to the conclusion that it will be very, very
useful for your Reason if I tell you about another event connected with the
mystery of the sacred 'almtznoshinoo,' which concerns that Sacred Individual
whose conception was actualized among your favorites and who, after his
formation, was named Jesus Christ.
"This important event, connected with the appearance of this Sacred
Individual among them, is denned, according to the understanding of your
contemporary favorites, by the words, the 'death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ. '
"Your acquaintance with this event will further enlighten you on the sense
and essential significance of the sacred sacrament of almtznoshinoo, and will
also give you a striking example of how—thanks only to the strange
inherency of their common psyche called 'wiseacring'—the meaning was
distorted of even those 'bits and pieces collected into a whole' from the
counsels and indications of the genuine Sacred Individuals intentionally
actualized from Above From the very first generation after the
contemporaries of these Sacred Individuals, nothing was left of what they call
'religious teachings' for the beings of subsequent generations except, as I told
you, material suitable for inventing 'children's fairy tales.'
"Well, my boy, when this Sacred Individual, Jesus Christ, actualized in the
planetary body of a terrestrial three-brained being, had to be separated from
his outer planetary coating, certain terrestrial three-brained beings performed
this sacred process of almtznoshinoo on his kesdjan body, so that in



view of the imminent violent interruption of his planetary existence, they
would have the possibility of continuing to communicate with his divine
Reason and of thus receiving the information about certain cosmic truths and
specific instructions for the future which he had not had time to give them.
"Information about this great event was accurately recorded by certain
participants in the performance of this sacred process, and was intentionally
communicated for a definite purpose to the ordinary beings around them.
"But inasmuch as that period of time coincided with the intensified
functioning of a certain aspect of the strange Reason of your favorites,
namely, the periodic 'ekbarzerbazia,' or the inherent need to lead their fellow
beings into error, and also because many of them were then striving to be
called 'learned'—learned, of course, of 'new formation'— they inserted all
sorts of 'absurdities' in most of the notes and descriptions set down by the
witnesses of this sacred process for transmission to future generations For
example, in addition to the incontestable information that Jesus Christ had
been crucified on a cross, and that after the crucifixion he was buried, they
demonstrated Just as convincingly that after his crucifixion and burial Jesus
Christ was resurrected and continued to exist among them and to teach this
and that—and only afterward did he raise himself with his planetary body to
Heaven.
"As a result of this kind of wiseacring of theirs—criminal, in the objective
sense—all true faith in the divine teaching of salvation of the All-Loving
Jesus Christ, uniquely feasible for them, was totally destroyed in the beings of
subsequent generations.
"The absurdities that were written down gradually engendered in the
presences of certain beings of later generations the impulse of doubt, not only
about what I have just told you, but also concerning all the real information
and



accurate instructions and explanations of this Sacred Individual, intentionally
actualized among them from Above.
"The data engendering doubt in these terrestrial three-brained beings began
to be crystallized and became an inalienable part of their psyche chiefly
because, in spite of the almost automatic existence proper to them, they grad
ually acquired in the course of many of their centuries data for a more or less
correct instinctive sensing of certain cosmic truths, as for instance, the
indubitable fact that if the process of the sacred rascooarno occurs to anyone
or, as they say, if someone 'dies' and is buried, this being will never exist
again, nor will he ever speak or teach again.
"And so those of your unfortunate favorites in whom there still proceeded,
however feebly, the functioning of being-mentation according to the laws of
sane logic, and who had refused to accept such illogical and incoherent ab
surdities, ultimately lost all faith in any truth, whatever it might be, actually
uttered and explained by the Sacred Individual, Jesus Christ.
"And as for the other terrestrial three-brained beings who, by the way, form
the majority, they for many reasons—but chiefly because in the earliest years
of their existence it became proper to them to occupy themselves with 'moor
doorten'—on reaching responsible age, usually turn into what are called
'psychopaths,' accepting blindly, and literally, without any being-logical
mentation, all the fantastic 'absurdities' which have reached them, and a very
peculiar kind of 'faith' in all this 'religious teaching' becomes automatically
formed in them, as if it represented the totality of all the truths relating to this
Sacred Individual, Jesus Christ, who was indeed intentionally actualized
among them from Above.
"The information about what is called the 'Last Supper,' given in the
collection of notes still existing among your contemporary favorites, which
purports to be the true and



accurate history of this Sacred Individual and is called by them 'Holy Writ,'
was nothing other than an account of the preparation for the great sacrament
of almtznoshinoo on the kesdjan body of Saint Jesus Christ.
"It is interesting to remark that in this collection of notes from 'bits here
and bits there,' which your favorites call 'Holy Writ,' there are many exact
words and even whole sentences uttered at that Last Supper by Saint Jesus
Christ himself, as well as by those directly initiated by him, who in this Holy
Scripture are called 'disciples' or 'apostles ' But your favorites, particularly the
contemporary ones, understand these words and phrases, just as they do
everything else, only literally, without any awareness of their inner meaning.
"And this nonsensical, literal understanding is due, of course, to the fact
that they have entirely ceased making the being-efforts necessary to fulfill in
their common presence partkdolgduty, which alone can crystallize in three
brained beings the data for the capacity of genuine being-comprehension.
"That is why, my boy, they cannot even understand the fact that in the days
when this Sacred Individual, Jesus Christ, was actualized among them and
also when this Holy Writ of theirs was being complied, fewer words were
used by those beings than are used at the present time.
"They do not realize that at that period the 'being-mentation' of beings on
this planet was closer to the normal mentation proper to three-brained beings,
and consequently the transmission of ideas and thoughts was still what is
called 'imagonisirian' or, as is otherwise said, 'allegorical. '
"In other words, in order to explain some action or other to themselves or
to someone else, the terrestrial three-brained beings of that time referred to the
understanding already present in them of similar actions in the past.
"But now all this takes place in them according to the principle called 'chainonizironness.'



"And this came about because, thanks as always to the abnormally
established conditions of ordinary existence, their being-mentation began to
function without any participation of their 'localization of feeling' or, in their
terminology, their 'feeling center,' and thus finally became completely
automatized.
"Hence, during all this time, in order to be able to make anything clear to
themselves, even approximately, or explain it to others, they have
automatically been compelled to invent, and go on inventing, a great many
almost meaningless words for things and also for ideas, great and small, and
so their mentation has gradually begun to function, as I have just said,
according to the principle of 'chainonizironness.' '
"Well, it is with this kind of mentation that your contemporary favorites
try to decipher and understand a text written in the 'imagonisirian' manner for
the mentation of beings who were contemporaries of the divine Jesus Christ.
"In this connection, my boy, I must explain a certain fact, absurd to the
highest degree and in the objective sense blasphemous, so that you may see
more clearly the real nothingness of their Holy Writ, which has become
particularly widely spread among your favorites since their last process of
reciprocal destruction, and in which, as you may already surmise, there is
everything you please except reality and truth.
"I will tell you in particular about what is said in this Holy Writ, which has
supposedly reached them in an unchanged form, about the most important,
most reasonable, and most devoted of all the beings directly initiated by this
Sacred Individual or, as they would say, about one of his 'apostles.'
"This devoted and beloved apostle, initiated by Jesus Christ, was named
Judas.
"Anyone wishing to draw knowledge of the truth from the present version
of this Holy Writ will arrive at the conviction, which will become fixed in his
essence, that this



Judas was the basest of all conceivable beings, and a conscienceless, doublefaced traitor. "But in fact, not only was this Judas the most faithful and devoted of all the
close followers of Jesus Christ, but it was solely thanks to his Reason and
presence of mind that all the acts of this Sacred Individual could produce that
result which, if it did not lead to the total destruction of the consequences of
the properties of the organ kundabuffer in these unfortunate three-brained
beings, was nevertheless, during twenty centuries, the source of nourishment
and inspiration for the majority of them, and made their desolate existence at
least a little endurable.
"In order that you may represent more clearly to yourself the genuine
individuality of this Judas and the significance of his manifestation, you
should also know that when the Sacred Individual, Jesus Christ, intentionally
actualized in a planetary body of a terrestrial being, was completely formed
for responsible existence, he decided to carry out the mission imposed on him
from Above to enlighten the Reason of these three-brained terrestrial beings
by means of twelve beings chosen from different types, initiated and prepared
by him personally.
"But at the very peak of his divine activities, before having fulfilled his
intention, that is, before having had time to explain certain cosmic truths and
give the required instructions for the future, he was compelled by
circumstances independent of him to allow the premature cessation of his
planetary existence to take place.
"He therefore decided, together with the twelve terrestrial beings he had
intentionally initiated, to have recourse to the sacred sacrament of
almtznoshinoo—the actualization of which was already well known to them,
as they had already acquired in their presences all the data for its fulfillment
so that he should have the possibility, while he was still in that cosmic
individual state, to finish the work of prepara



tion, according to the plan he had designed for accomplishing the mission
assigned to him from Above.
"But, my boy, when they had decided on this and were ready to begin the
preliminary preparations required for this sacred sacrament, they saw that it
was utterly impossible because it was too late, they were already surrounded
by beings called 'guards,' and their arrest, with everything that would follow,
was expected at any moment.
"And it was just here that Judas intervened. "This future saint, the inseparable and devoted helper of Jesus Christ, who
is 'hated' and 'cursed' owing to the naive stupidity of the peculiar three-brained
beings of your planet, then rendered his great objective service for which
terrestrial three-brained beings of all subsequent generations should be
grateful.
"The wise and onerous initiative that he took upon himself with
disinterested devotion was that at the moment of despair, on ascertaining that
it was impossible to fulfill the required preparation for carrying out the sacred
almtznoshinoo, this Judas, now a saint, leaped to his feet and hurriedly said:
'I will go and do everything necessary so that you have the possibility to
fulfill this sacred preparation without hindrance Meanwhile, set to work at
once. '
"Having said this, he approached Jesus Christ and, after speaking with him
aside for a few moments, he received his blessing and hurriedly left.
"Thus the others were able to complete without hindrance everything
necessary for the accomplishment of the sacred process of almtznoshinoo.
"After what I have just said, you will doubtless understand how the
terrestrial three-brained beings of the two types I described distort every truth,
for their various egoistic aims, and have done so to such an extent that in the
case of Judas, now a saint, thanks to whom alone they have benefited for



twenty centuries from a blessed hearth of tranquility in the midst of their desolate existence, there has been crystallized in the presence of beings of all later generations this unprecedentedly unjust representation. "I think myself that if Judas was portrayed in their Holy Writ in this way, it may have been because it was necessary for someone or other belonging to the mentioned types to belittle for a certain purpose the significance of Jesus Christ himself. "That is to say, it would make him appear so naive, so unable to feel and see beforehand, in a word, so unperfected that, in spite of knowing this Judas and existing with him for so long, he failed to sense and be aware that this nearest disciple of his was a perfidious traitor, who would sell him for thirty worthless pieces of silver.
At this point in his tales, Beelzebub and all the passengers of the intersystem ship Karnak suddenly sensed in their organs of taste a slightly sour and bitter flavor. The sensation was caused by a special 'magnetic current,' released from the steering compartment to inform all the passengers that their ship was approaching the place of their destination, in this case, the Holy Planet Purgatory. Beelzebub therefore interrupted his tale and, glancing affectionately at his grandson, said: "Now, willy-nilly, we shall have to stop our talk about this Sacred Individual, Jesus Christ, but nevertheless, my boy, when we get home to our dear Karatas, remind me someday when I am free to tell you the rest of this story in detail. "The entire history of the actualization of this Sacred Individual in the planetary body of a terrestrial being— including his existence among the beings of various groupings on your planet and also his violent end—is very, very interesting, especially for you who wish to clarify to your



Reason all the subtleties of the strange psyche of these peculiar three-brained
beings, moreover it will be particularly interesting and instructive for you to
know that part of the history of Saint Jesus Christ which relates to the period
of his existence there from the age of twelve to the age of twenty-eight,
according to their time-calculation. "



CHAPTER 39
The Holy Planet Purgatory
AFTER SEVERAL "dianosks" the cosmic ship Karnak left the holy planet, and
again began to fall toward its final destination, namely, toward the planet
which had been the place of Beelzebub's arising and whither he was returning
to finish his long existence—that long existence which, on account of certain
definite circumstances, he had had to spend on various cosmic concentrations
of our Great Universe, always under conditions very unfavorable for him
personally, but which he nevertheless fulfilled, in the objective sense, quite
meritoriously.
When the usual tempo of the falling of the ship Karnak had been
reestablished, Hassein, sitting down once more at his grandfather's feet,
turned to him and said:
"Grandfather, oh, dear Grandfather! Explain to me, please, why, as my
Uncle Tooilan told me, does our All-Embracing, Uni-Being Autocrat
Endlessness appear so often upon that holy planet where we have just been?"
At this question of his grandson, Beelzebub became thoughtful a little
longer and with more concentration than usual, and then said slowly:
"Yes I do not know, my dear boy, with what to begin this time in order
to answer this question of yours in such a form as would satisfy me also, since
among the many other tasks I have set myself as regards your 'oskiano,' I
decided to see that you should have at your present age a thorough knowledge
and understanding concerning this holy planet.
"In any case, you must first of all be told that this holy planet, which is called 'Purgatory,' is the heart, as it were, and place of concentration of all the final results of the pul



sation of everything that functions and exists in the whole of our Great
Universe.
"Our Common Father Creator Endlessness appears there so often only
because this holy planet is the place of existence of the most unfortunate of
'highest being-bodies' who obtained their coating on various planets of the
whole of our Great Universe.
"The 'highest being-bodies' who have become worthy to dwell on this holy
planet suffer as perhaps no one and nothing suffers in the whole of our Great
Universe.
"In view of this, our All-Loving, All-Merciful, and Absolutely Just Creator
Endlessness, having no other possibility of helping these unfortunate 'highest
being-bodies,' often appears there, so that by these appearances of His, He
may soothe them, if only a little, in their terrible yet inevitable state of
inexpressible anguish.
"This holy planet began to fulfill its aim long after the period of the flow
of time when the process of 'creation' of the now-existing 'world' had been
finished.
"In the beginning, all the 'highest being-bodies,' like those who now have
the place of their existence on this holy planet, went directly to our Most Most
Holy Sun Absolute, but later, when that all-universal terrifying calamity
which we call the 'chootboglitanical period' occurred in the Megalocosmos,
similar 'highest being-bodies,' having lost the possibility of blending directly
with our Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, began to dwell on this holy planet.
"Only after this 'chootboglitanical period' did the necessity arise for that
order of universal functioning which this Holy Planet Purgatory fulfills at the
present time.
"And from then on, the whole surface of this holy planet was organized
and adapted for these highest being-bodies as the place of their subsequent
unavoidable existence.
Having said this, Beelzebub thought a little, and then with a slight smile continued:



"Not only is this holy planet the center of concentration of the results of
the functioning of all that exists, but it is now also the best, the richest, and
the most beautiful of all the planets of our Universe.
"When we were there, you probably noticed that we always saw and
sensed that the entire space of our Great Universe or, as your favorites would
say, the 'whole sky,' seemed to reflect a radiance recalling that of the famous
and incomparable 'almacornian turquoise ' Its atmosphere is always as pure as
the 'phenomenal sakrooalnian crystal. '
"Everywhere on that planet, each individual, with all his presence, senses
everything around him 'iskoloonitzinernly' or, as your favorites would say,
'blissfully-delightfully. '
"On that holy planet, as the well-informed say, of springs alone, both
mineral and fresh, which in purity and clarity are unequaled on any other
planet of our Universe, there are about ten thousand.
"From the whole of our Universe the most beautiful and melodious
'songbirds' are gathered there, of which, according to the experts, there are
about twelve thousand species.
"And as for the surplanetary formations, such as 'flowers,' 'fruits,' 'berries,'
and so on, words are inadequate Suffice it to say that there are collected and
acclimatized on this planet almost the whole 'flora,' 'fauna,' and 'foscalia' from
all the planets of our Great Universe.
"Everywhere on that holy planet, in well-situated 'gorges,' there are
convenient 'caves' of various interior forms, some made by Nature and some
artificially, with striking views from their entrances In these caves there is
everything required for a blissful and serene existence, completely free from
essence-anxiety in any part of the presence of a cosmic independent
Individual, such as 'highest being-bodies' can become.
"It is in these very caves that, by their own choice, those 'highest being
bodies' exist who, owing to their merits,



come to this holy planet from the whole of our Great Universe to continue
their existence.
"In addition to all I have mentioned, they also have at their disposal the
very best, most convenient, and most rapid 'egolionopties' or, as they are still
sometimes called, 'omnipresent platforms. '
"These egolionopties move freely in all directions in the atmosphere of the
holy planet, at any desired speed, even at the speed of falling of the second
order suns of our Universe.
"This system of egolionopty was, I believe, invented specially for this holy
planet by the famous angel, now already Archangel Herkission.
Having uttered these last words, Beelzebub suddenly became silent and again
deeply thoughtful, and Hassein and Ahoon looked at him with surprise and
interrogation.
After some time had passed, Beelzebub, shaking his head in a certain
manner, turned again to Hassein and said:
"I am just thinking that it would be very reasonable on my part if to this
question of yours—why our Endlessness so often rejoices this holy planet
with His appearance—I should answer in such a way that I could also explain,
as I have several times promised you, about the fundamental cosmic laws by
which our present world exists and is maintained, because it is only by taking
these two questions together that you will have sufficient material for a full
representation and a thorough understanding of this Holy Planet Purgatory,
and at the same time learn more about the three-brained beings who interest
you and who arise on the planet Earth.
"I also now wish to give you as many clear and detailed explanations as
possible concerning this holy planet, because sooner or later you will have to
know about it, since every responsible three-brained being of our Universe,
irrespective of the cause and the place of his arising and also of the form



of his exterior coating, will ultimately have to know everything about this holy planet. "And he must know all this in order to strive to exist in the direction corresponding to the sense and aim of existence—a striving which is the objective lot of every three-brained being in whom, for whatever reason, the germ arises for the coating of the 'highest being-body. "And so, my boy, first of all I must repeat once more that our Endlessness was forced to create the whole world which exists at the present time "In the beginning, when nothing yet existed and when the whole of our
Universe was empty endless space, with the presence only of the prime-source
cosmic substance 'ethernokrilno,' our Most Great and Most Most Holy Sun
Absolute existed alone in all this empty space, and it was on this sole cosmic
concentration that our Uni-Being Creator with His cherubim and seraphim had
the place of His Most Glorious Being.
"It was just during this period of the flow of time that there appeared to our Creator All-Maintainer the imperative need to create our now-existing 'Megalocosmos,' that is, our 'world. ' "We were privileged to learn from the third most sacred canticle of our cherubim and seraphim that our Omnipotent Creator once ascertained that the Sun Absolute, on which He dwelt with His cherubim and seraphim, was almost imperceptibly, yet steadily, diminishing in volume. "As this fact ascertained by Him appeared very serious, He decided to review immediately all the laws which maintained the existence of that still unique cosmic concentration. "During this review, it became clear to our Omnipotent Creator for the first time that the cause of this gradual diminishing of the volume of the Sun Absolute was simply the 'Heropass,' that is, the flow of Time itself
"Thereupon our Endlessness grew deeply thoughtful, for



in His divine deliberations He had become clearly aware that if the action of
the Heropass should continue to diminish the volume of the Sun Absolute, it
would sooner or later bring about the complete destruction of this sole place
of His Being.
"And in view of this, our Endlessness was compelled to take certain
corresponding measures, so that this merciless Heropass could not bring about
the eventual destruction of our Most Most Holy Sun Absolute.
"Furthermore, we were found worthy of learning, again from a sacred
canticle of our cherubim and seraphim but this time the fifth sacred canticle,
that after this divine ascertainment of His, our Endlessness devoted Himself
entirely to finding some way of averting this inevitable end, ordained by the
lawful commands of the merciless Heropass, and that, after long divine
deliberations, He decided to create our now existing 'Megalocosmos.'
"To understand more clearly how our Endlessness decided to attain
immunity from the maleficent action of the merciless Heropass and how He
ultimately accomplished it, you must first know that before this the Most Most
Holy Sun Absolute existed on the basis of the system called 'Autoegocrat,'
according to which the inner forces that maintained the existence of this
cosmic concentration had an independent functioning, not dependent on any
forces coming from outside This system was based on those two fundamental
sacred cosmic laws by which the whole of our Megalocosmos is still
maintained, namely, on the two primordial cosmic laws called the sacred
'Heptaparaparshinokh' and the sacred 'Triamazikamno.'
"I have already told you a little about these two fundamental primordial
sacred cosmic laws, however, I shall now try to explain them to you in rather
more detail.
"The first of these fundamental primordial sacred cosmic



laws, namely the law of Heptaparaparshinokh, is formulated by cosmic Objective Science in the following words: 'The flow of forces follows a line that constantly deflects at specific intervals and unites again at its ends. ' "According to this primordial sacred cosmic law, the line of the flow of
forces has seven points of deflection or, as is otherwise said, seven 'centers of
gravity,' and the distance between two consecutive points of deflection, or
'centers of gravity,' is called a 'stopinder of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh.'
"The complete process of this sacred law, acting through everything newly
arising and existing, is always made up of seven stopinders.
"And as regards the second fundamental primordial cosmic law, namely the
sacred Triamazikamno, cosmic Objective Science formulates it in these terms.
'A new arising from the previously arisen through the "harnel-miatznel,"
the process of which is actualized thus the higher blends with the lower in
order together to actualize the middle, and thus to become either higher for the
preceding lower or lower for the succeeding higher.
"As I have already told you, this sacred Triamazikamno consists of three
independent forces, which are called:
the first, 'surp-otheos' the second,
'surp-skiros' the third, 'surp-athanotos'
"Objective Science calls these three holy forces of the sacred
Triamazikamno by the following names:
the first, the 'affirming force' or the 'pushing force' or simply the 'force plus'



the second, the 'denying force' or the 'resisting force' or simply the 'force minus' the third, the 'reconciling force' or the 'equilibrating force' or the
'neutralizing force '
"At this place in my explanations concerning the fundamental laws of 'world
creation' and 'world-maintenance,' it is interesting to note, by the way, that the
three-brained beings of this planet that has taken your fancy, during the period
before the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer had been
crystallized in their common presence, began to be aware of these three holy
forces of the sacred Triamazikamno, which they named:
the first, 'God the Father' the second, 'God the Son'
and the third, 'God the Holy Ghost '
"In various circumstances they expressed the hidden meaning of these forces
and their longing to receive from them a beneficent effect for their own
individuality by the following prayers:
Sources of divine rejoicings, revolts, and sufferings, direct your actions upon us
Holy Affirming, Holy Denying,
Holy Reconciling, transubstantiate
in me for my being



or
Holy God, Holy the Firm, Holy the
Immortal, have mercy on us
"Now, my boy, listen very attentively. "In the beginning, as I have already told you, our Most Most Holy Sun
Absolute was maintained solely by means of these two primordial sacred
laws, but at that time these laws functioned quite independently without the
help of any forces whatever coming from outside, and this system was called
'Autoegocrat.'
"And when our All-Maintaining Endlessness decided to change the
principle of functioning of both these fundamental sacred laws, He made their
hitherto independent functioning dependent on forces coming from outside.
"Since this new system of functioning of the forces which until then
maintained the existence of the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute required the
existence of corresponding sources outside the Sun Absolute, where such
forces could arise and from which they could flow into the presence of the
Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, our Almighty Endlessness was then
compelled to create our existing Megalocosmos with all the cosmoses of
different scales and the relatively independent cosmic formations contained in
it, and since then the system for maintaining the existence of the Sun
Absolute has been called 'Trogoautoegocrat. '
"Our Common Father Uni-Being Endlessness, having decided to change the
principle of the maintenance of existence of that still unique cosmic
concentration and sole place of His Most Glorious Being, first altered the
functioning itself.



of these two primordial sacred laws, and He made the greater change in the
law of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh.
"This change in the functioning of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh
consisted in the alteration of what is called the 'subjective action' of three of
its 'stopinders.' In one He lengthened the law-conformable duration, in
another He shortened it, and in a third, disharmonized it.
"To provide the stopinder between the third and fourth 'points of
deflection' with the required property of absorbing for its functioning the
automatic inflow of all surrounding forces, He prolonged its duration.
"And this is the stopinder of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh which is still
called the 'mechano-coinciding mdnelin. '
"And the stopinder that He shortened is between the last 'point of
deflection' and the beginning of a new cycle of the completing process of this
sacred law By this shortening, in order to facilitate the beginning of a new
cycle, He predetermined that the functioning of this stopinder would depend
solely upon the influx through that stopinder of external forces resulting from
the action of that cosmic concentration itself in which the completing process
of this primordial sacred law is flowing.
"And this stopinder of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh is the one that is
still called the 'intentionally actualized mdnelin. '
"As regards the third stopinder which was changed in its subjective action
and which is fifth in the series and called 'harnel-aoot,' its disharmony came
about by itself, simply as a result of the change of the other two stopinders.
"This disharmony of its subjective functioning, resulting from its
'asymmetry' in relation to the whole process of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, consists in the following:
"If the completing process of this sacred law flows in conditions in which
it is subject to many 'extraneously'



caused' vibrations, its functioning produces only external results.
"But if this same process takes place in absolute quiet, in the absence of
any extraneously caused vibrations whatever, all the results of the functioning
of this stopinder remain within that concentration in which the process is
completed, and these results only become perceptible to the outside on direct
and immediate contact with it.
"But if during the functioning of this process neither of these two sharply
opposite conditions predominates, the results of its action usually divide into
the external and the internal.
"Thus from that time on, the actualization of the primordial sacred law of
Heptaparaparshinokh began to proceed in the greatest as well as the smallest
cosmic concentrations with the subjective action of its stopinders changed in
this way.
"I repeat, my boy, try very hard to understand everything relating to both these
fundamental cosmic laws, since knowledge of these two sacred laws,
especially knowledge of the particularities of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh,
will help you later to understand very well and easily all the second-order and
third-order laws of 'world-creation' and 'world-existence. '
"Furthermore, an all-around awareness of everything concerning these
sacred laws makes it possible for three-brained beings, irrespective of the
form of their exterior coating, to become able, in the presence of all
surrounding cosmic factors not depending on them, whether favorable or
unfavorable, to ponder on the sense of their own existence, and so to acquire
data for the elucidation and reconciliation in themselves of that 'individual
collision,' as it is called, which often arises in three-brained beings from the
contradiction between the concrete results flowing from the



processes of all the cosmic laws and the results presupposed and even
definitely expected by their 'sane logic ' And so, correctly evaluating the
essential significance of their own presence, they become capable of being
aware of the place truly corresponding to them in these common-cosmic
actualizations.
"In short, the transubstantiation in themselves of an all-around
understanding of the functioning of these two fundamental sacred laws leads
to the crystallization in the common presence of three-brained beings of data
for engendering that divine property, indispensable to every normal three
brained being, existing under the name of 'semooniranoos.' Your favorites also
have an approximate representation of this, and they call it 'impartiality. '
"And so, my dear boy, when in the beginning our Common Father Creator
Almighty changed the functioning of both these primordial sacred laws, He
directed the action of their forces from within the Most Most Holy Sun
Absolute into the space of the Universe, whereupon there came into being the
'Emanation of the Sun Absolute,' which is now called 'Theomertmalogos' or
'Word-God.'
"For the sake of clarity in certain of my further explanations it must be
remarked here that, in the process of creation of the now existing world, the
'Force of the Divine Will' of our Endlessness participated only at the very
beginning.
"The subsequent creation went on automatically, of its own accord, entirely
without the participation of the 'Force of His Own Divine Will,' thanks only to
these two changed fundamental cosmic laws.
"And the process of creation then took place in the following sequence:
"Thanks to the new property of the fifth stopinder of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, the emanations issuing from



the Sun Absolute began to act at certain definite points of the space of the Universe upon the prime-source cosmic substance 'ethernokrilno,' and thus, by means of the totality of the old and new properties of the sacred primordial laws, certain definite concentrations began to take form. "Further, thanks to those factors these definite concentrations acquired their own laws of Heptaparaparshinokh and Triamazikamno, which began to exert their action upon each other, and there were gradually crystallized in these concentrations everything necessary for the appearance of those large concentrations which still exist and are now called 'second-order suns.' "When these newly arisen suns had been completely actualized and both fundamental laws with their own functioning had been finally established in them, then, in the same way as in the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, their own results began to be transformed and radiated, and these, uniting with the emanations of the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute in the space of the Universe, became factors for the actualization of the common-cosmic fundamental process of the sacred law of Triamazikamno .
"That is to say: "The Most Most Holy Theomertmalogos began to manifest itself in the
quality of the third holy force of the sacred Triamazikamno, the results of the
action of any one of the newly arisen 'second-order suns' began to serve as the
first holy force And the results of all the newly arisen 'second-order suns' as a
whole, acting upon the given newly arisen 'second-order sun,' began to serve
as the second holy force of this sacred law.
"As soon as the process of the common-cosmic sacred Triamazikamno was thus established in the space of the Universe, crystallizations of different 'densities' were gradually formed out of that same prime-source ethernokrilno, and began to group themselves around each of the second-order



suns, giving rise to new concentrations—and in this way more new suns appeared, but this time 'third-order suns.' "These third-order cosmic concentrations are those which at the present time are called 'planets. ' "At this stage in the process of the first outer cycle of the fundamental
sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, that is, after the formation of the third-order
suns or 'planets,' owing to the changed fifth deflection of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh—which, as I have already said, is called 'harnel-aoot'
just here, the initial impulse given for the completing process, having lost half
the force of its vivifyingness, manifested only half of its action outside itself,
keeping the other half for itself—that is, for its own functioning—in conse
quence of which, on these last big results called 'third-order suns' or 'planets,'
there began to arise what are called 'similarities to the already arisen. '
"And as the surrounding conditions of actualization were established
everywhere in conformity with the second particularity of the fifth stopinder
of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, the development of the fundamental outer
cycle of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh came to an end, and the entire action
of its functioning entered forever into the results already manifested by it, and
from then on there began in them their own permanent processes of
transformation, called 'evolution' and 'involution.'
"Then, this time thanks to a second-order cosmic law named 'litsvrts' or the
'aggregation of the homogeneous,' the 'relatively independent' formations
called 'similarities to the already arisen' began to be grouped on the planets
into yet other 'relatively independent' formations.
"Owing to these processes of 'evolution' and 'involution' inherent in the
sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, there also began to be crystallized and
decrystallized in the presence of all cosmic concentrations, great and small,
all sorts of definite



cosmic substances, with their own subjective properties, which Objective Science calls 'active elements. ' "And all the results of the 'evolution' and 'involution' of these active
elements, actualizing the trogoautoegocratic principle of existence of
everything in the Universe by means of reciprocal feeding and maintenance,
produce the common-cosmic process 'Iraniranumange,' or what Objective
Science calls the 'universal exchange of substances.
"So, my boy, thanks to this new system of 'reciprocal feeding of
everything existing,' in which our Most Most Holy Sun Absolute Itself took
part, that equilibrium was established in the Universe which no longer gives
the merciless Heropass the possibility of bringing about anything unforeseen
to our Most Great and Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, and thus, the cause for
the divine anxiety of our Almighty Uni-Being Endlessness concerning the
wholeness of His eternal place of dwelling disappeared forever.
Here I must tell you that when this vast divine actualization was completed,
our triumphant cherubim and seraphim gave for the first time to all the newly
arisen concentrations the names that exist even today They then defined every
'relatively independent' concentration by the word 'cosmos,' and to distinguish
the different orders of arising of these cosmoses, they added to this term a
specific corresponding name.
"They named the Most Most Holy Prime-Source Sun Absolute Itself
'Protocosmos.'
"Each newly arisen second-order sun, with all its definite results, they
called 'Deuterocosmos.'
"Each third-order sun, which we now call a 'planet,' they called
'Tritocosmos.'
"The smallest 'relatively independent' formation that arose on the planets, thanks to the new inherency of the fifth



stopinder of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, and which is the very smallest
likeness of the Whole, was called 'microcosmos', and finally, those
'aggregates of microcosmoses' that also became concentrated on the planets,
this time thanks to the second-order cosmic law called 'mutual attraction of
the similar,' were named 'tetartocosmoses.'
"And all those cosmoses that together compose our present world were
called the 'Megalocosmos. '
"Our cherubim also gave names, still existing today, to the emanations and
radiations issuing from all these cosmoses of different scales, by means of
which the Most Great Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat proceeds.
"The emanation of the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute Itself, as I have
already told you, they called 'Theomertmalogos,' or 'Word-God.'
"The radiation of each separate second-order sun they called
'mentokifezoin.'
"The radiation of each planet separately they called 'dynamoomzoin.' "That given off from the microcosmoses they called 'photoinzoin. ' "The radiations issuing from the tetartocosmoses they called 'hanbledzoïn.'
"The radiation of all the planets together of each solar system they called 'astroluolucizoin. ' "The radiation of all the newly arisen second-order suns taken together
they called 'polorotheoparl. '
"And the aggregate of the results issuing from all cosmic sources, great
and small, they then named the 'common-cosmic Ansanbaluiazar.'
"It is interesting to remark concerning this 'common-cosmic
Ansanbaluiazar' that present-day Objective Science has the formulation.'
'Everything issuing from everything and again entering into everything.



"Specific names were also given to all the 'temporarily independent crystallizations' arising in each of the innumerable cosmoses through the evolutionary and involutionary processes of these fundamental sacred laws.. "I shall not enumerate the names of the many temporarily independent 'centers of gravity' which were crystallized in each separate cosmos, but I shall indicate only the names of those 'definite active-element centers of gravity' in the cosmoses having a direct relation to my later elucidations, that is, of those temporarily independent centers of gravity crystallized in the presences of tetartocosmoses. "These independent crystallizations in tetartocosmoses were given the following names:
1 protoëhary 2 deuteroëhary 3 tritoëhary 4 tetartoëhary 5 pentoëhary 6 exioëhary 7 resulzarion
"And now, my boy, after everything I have just explained to you we can return to the question of why and how the 'highest being-bodies' or, as your favorites call them, 'souls,' began to arise in our Universe, and why our UniBeing Common Father turned His divine attention particularly to these cosmic arisings. "The point is that when the 'common-cosmic harmonious equilibrium' had been established and regularized in all the cosmoses of different scales, then in each of the tetartocosmoses, that is, those relatively independent 'aggregates of microcosmoses' that had their arising on the surface of the planets—where the surrounding conditions accidentally cor



responded to certain data present in these cosmoses, enabling them to exist
for a certain period of time without 'seccruano' or, in other words, without
'constant individual tension'— the possibility appeared of independent
automatic movement from one place to another on the surface of these
planets.
"Thereupon, when our Common Father Endlessness perceived this
automatic movement of theirs, there arose in Him for the first time the divine
idea of making use of it as a help for Himself in the administration of the
enlarging world.
"From that time on He began to actualize everything for these
tetartocosmoses along such lines that the inevitable 'okrualno,' that is, the
periodic repetition in them of the completing process of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, could be accomplished in such a way that, under the
conditions of a certain kind of change in the functioning of the common
presences of some of them, there would be transformed and crystallized, in
addition to the crystallizations that had to be transformed for the purpose of
the new common-cosmic exchange of substances, also those active elements
from which new independent formations could be coated in them with the
inherent possibility of acquiring 'individual Reason. '
"That this idea arose then for the first time in our Endlessness we can also
hear from the words of the sacred canticles with which, at all divine
solemnities, our cherubim and seraphim extol the marvelous works of our
Creator.
"Before going on to relate how this was accomplished, I must tell you that
the functioning of the common-cosmic Iraniranumange is harmonized in such
a way that all the results obtained from transformations in different cosmoses
localize themselves together according to what is called the 'quality of their
vibrations,' and penetrate everywhere throughout the Universe, taking a
corresponding part in



both planetary and surplanetary formations, and generally the temporary place of their free concentration is the 'atmosphere' with which all the planets of our Megalocosmos are surrounded, and through which the connection is established for the common-cosmic Iraniranumange. "And thus, the effect of this divine attention directed toward these tetartocosmoses was that, while serving as apparatuses for the Most Great Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, the possibility appeared in them that from among the cosmic substances transformed through them, both for the needs of this most great common-cosmic process and for the needs of the process of their own existence—the latter substances composed exclusively of cosmic crystallizations derived from the transformations of that planet itself on which these tetartocosmoses arose—results began to appear in their common presences such as proceed from cosmic sources of a higher order, and composed of what are called vibrations of greater 'vivifyingness.' "And it was from such cosmic results that exactly similar forms began to be coated in their common presences, composed at first of the cosmic substance 'mentokifezoin,' that is, of substances transformed by the sun and the other planets of that solar system within whose limits these tetartocosmoses had the place of their arising—substances that reach every planet through the radiations of the said cosmic concentrations. "In this way, the common presence of certain tetartocosmoses then began to be composed of two independent formations coming from two entirely different cosmic sources, and these formations began to have a Joint existence, as if one were placed within the other. "Well, my boy, when these new 'coatings' were completed and began to function correspondingly in the presence of the tetartocosmoses, from that time on they ceased



to be called 'tetartocosmoses' and were called 'beings,' which then meant 'two
natured,' and these second coatings were named 'kesdjan bodies.'
"Now when everything corresponding to it was acquired in the new coating
of these two-natured formations and all the functioning proper to such cosmic
arisings was finally established, these new formations in their turn—on
exactly the same basis as in the first case, and also provided that there was a
certain change of functioning—began to absorb and assimilate cosmic
substances issuing directly from the Most Most Holy Theomertmalogos, after
which, similarities of a third kind began to be coated in them.
"These coatings, which are the 'highest sacred parts' of beings, we now call
'highest being-bodies.'
"Later, when their 'highest being-bodies' were finally coated and all the
corresponding functions had been acquired in them, and above all when it
became possible for the data for engendering the sacred function of 'Objective
Reason' to become crystallized in them—data that can be crystallized
exclusively in the presence of cosmic arisings of this order—and when what is
called 'rascooarno' occurred to these 'tetartocosmoses,' or 'beings,' that is, the
separation from each other of these differently natured 'three-in-one
formations,' only then did this 'highest being-part' receive the possibility of
uniting itself with the Cause of Causes of everything now existing, our Most
Most Holy Sun Absolute, and begin to fulfill the purpose on which our All
Embracing Endlessness had placed His hope.
"Now I must explain to you in greater detail in what sequence this sacred
rascooarno occurred to these first tetartocosmoses and how it occurs now to
the three-brained beings.
"At first the 'second being-body,' or 'kesdjan body,' and 'third being-body'
separate themselves from the fundamen



tal 'planetary body' and, leaving it behind on the planet, rise together to the
sphere that is the place of concentration of those cosmic substances from
which the 'kesdjan body' of a being is formed.
"And only at the end of a certain time does the principal and final sacred
rascooarno occur to this 'two-natured arising,' after which the 'highest being
part' becomes an independent Individual with its own individual Reason.
"Formerly, that is, prior to the 'chootboglitanical period,' it was only after
the second process of the sacred rascooarno that this sacred cosmic
actualization became worthy of being united with the presence of our Most
Most Holy Sun Absolute or went to other cosmic concentrations where such
independent holy Individuals were needed.
"And if at the approach of the final process of the sacred rascooarno these
cosmic arisings had not yet attained the required gradation of the sacred scale
of Reason, these 'highest being-parts' had to exist in that sphere until they had
perfected their Reason to the required gradation.
"Here it is impossible not to take notice of the objective terror of the
already formed 'highest being-parts' who, owing to all the results unforeseen
from Above in new cosmic processes, have not yet perfected themselves to
the necessary gradation of Reason.
"The fact is that, in accordance with various second-order cosmic laws, the
'kesdjan being-body' cannot exist long in this sphere, and at the end of a
certain time must decompose, even if the 'highest being-part' existing within it
has not by that time attained the requisite degree of Reason As long as this
'highest being-part' has not perfected its Reason to the requisite degree, it must
always be dependent upon some kesdjanian arising or other, so that
immediately after the second sacred rascooarno every still unperfected
'highest being-body' enters a state called 'teshgekdnel' or 'searching for a
similar two-natured arising corresponding to itself,' in



the hope that as soon as the highest part of another two-natured arising
perfects itself to the required degree of Reason and undergoes the final
process of the sacred rascooarno, and before the rapid disintegration of its
kesdjan body is clearly sensed, this first 'highest being-body' might instantly
enter that other kesdjan body and continue to exist in it for its further
perfecting, a perfecting which sooner or later must inevitably be
accomplished by every arisen 'highest being-body. '
"And that is why, in the sphere to which the higher being-parts rise after
the first sacred rascooarno, that process takes place called the 'okipakhalevian
substitution of the external part of the soul,' or 'substitution of a new kesdjan
body for the old one. '
"Here it might as well be mentioned that your favorites also have a
representation somewhat similar, as it were, to the 'okipakhalevian
substitution ' They have even invented very clever names for it,
'metempsychosis' and 'reincarnation,' and in the last century have created
around this question a branch of their famous 'science' which gradually
became, and still is, one of those minor maleficent factors which in their
totality are making their Reason, already strange enough without this, always
more and more 'shooroombooroom,' as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin would
say.
"According to the fantastic theories of this branch of their 'science,' now
called 'spiritualism,' they assume among other things that each of them
already has a 'highest being-part' or, as they call it, a 'soul,' and that this soul
is constantly undergoing reincarnation—something like this 'okipakhalevian
substitution' of which I have just spoken.
"Of course, if these unfortunates were to take into consideration that,
according to the second-order cosmic law called 'tenikdoa,' or 'law of gravity,'
this being-part, in the rare cases when it does appear in them, rises from the
surface of their planet immediately after the first rascooarno—or as



they express it, after the 'death' of the being—they would perhaps understand
that the explanations and proofs given by this branch of their 'science' for all
sorts of phenomena supposedly produced among them by these fantastic
'souls' of theirs are merely the fruits of their idle fancy; and they would then
realize that everything else 'proved' by this 'science' is nothing but Mullah
Nasr Eddin's 'twaddle.'
"Now let me tell you about the two lower being-bodies, namely, the planetary body and the kesdjan body. "After the first sacred rascooarno, the planetary body of a being which is
formed of microcosmoses, that is, of crystallizations transformed by the planet
itself, gradually decomposes according to a certain second-order cosmic law
called 'retarnotoltoor,' and disintegrates on that planet into the primordial
substances from which it arose.
"The second being-body, the kesdjan body, being formed of radiations of
other concentrations of tritocosmoses and of the sun itself of the given solar
system, rises to the corresponding sphere I was speaking about, and after the
second process of the sacred rascooarno also gradually decomposes, and the
crystallizations of which it consists return in various ways to the sphere of
their own primordial arisings.
"But the highest being-body, formed of crystallizations received directly
from the sacred Theomertmalogos within the limits of the solar system where
the being has arisen and existed, can never decompose And this highest part
must exist in the given solar system until perfected to the required degree of
Reason—just that Reason which makes such cosmic formations 'irankipaekh,'
that is, formations of the most most sacred substances already mentioned,
which can exist independently of kesdjanian arisings and not be subject to
what are called 'painful influences' from any external cosmic factors whatever.
"And so, my boy, in the beginning, as I have already told you, after these cosmic arisings had perfected their Reason



to the necessary gradation of the 'Sacred Scale of Reason,' they were taken onto the Sun Absolute, there to fulfill the roles predestined for them by our Creator Endlessness. "You should know that as regards the determination of the specific degrees of individuality, from the very beginning our cherubim and seraphim established that 'Sacred Determinator of Reason' which still exists and which measures the gradations of Reason or, more exactly, the 'totality of selfawareness' of all cosmic concentrations, large and small, and also determines the 'degree of justification of the sense and aim of their existence,' as well as the further role of each separate individual in relation to everything existing in our Great Megalocosmos. "This Sacred Determinator of Pure Reason is simply a kind of measuring rod, that is, a line divided into equal parts, one end of this scale marks the total absence of any Reason, that is, absolute 'Firm Calm,' and the other end indicates 'Absolute Reason,' that is, the Reason of our Incomparable Creator Endlessness. "Here I think you might as well be told about the various sources in the common presence of all three-brained beings for the manifestation of beingReason. "In every three-brained being, irrespective of the place of his arising and the form of his exterior coating, data can be crystallized for three independent kinds of being-mentation, the total results of which express the degree of Reason proper to him. "Data for these three kinds of being-Reason are crystallized in the presence
of each three-brained being to the extent that there are coated and perfected in
him—by means of being-partkdolgduty—the corresponding higher being
parts that should compose his common presence as a whole.
"The first and highest kind of being-Reason is the pure or Objective Reason proper only to the presence of the highest being-body or to the common presence of those three



brained beings in whom this highest part has already arisen and perfected itself, and then only if it has become the 'initiating center of gravity' of the individual functioning of the whole presence of the being. "The second kind of being-Reason, which is named 'okiartaitokhsa,' can appear in the presence of those three-brained beings in whom the second being-body, or kesdjan body, is already completely coated and functions independently. "As regards the third kind of being-Reason, this is nothing but the automatic functioning proceeding in the common presence of all beings in general and also in the presences of all surplanetary formations, thanks to repeated shocks coming from outside, which evoke habitual reactions from data crystallized in them corresponding to previous accidentally perceived impressions. "Now, my boy, before going into a more detailed explanation of how the higher parts were coated and perfected in the common presences of the first tetartocosmoses, and also of those who were afterward named 'beings,' I must give you some information about the fact that we, beings who arose on the planet Karatas, as well as those who have arisen on your planet Earth, are no longer 'polormedekhtic' or, as is still said, 'monoeniphitic,' as were the first beings who were transformed directly from the tetartocosmoses, but we are 'keschapmartnian' beings, that is, almost 'half-beings,' owing to which the completing process of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh does not take place through us or through your favorites exactly as it did in them. "We are such 'keschapmartnian' beings because the last fundamental stopinder of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, which almost all the beings of the Megalocosmos now call the sacred 'ashagiprotoëhary,' is not situated in the center of the planets upon which we have arisen, as in general is the case for most of the planets of our Great Megalocosmos,



but is in the center of their satellites, which for our planet Karatas is the little
planet of our solar system called 'Prnokh-Paiokh,' and for the planet Earth, its
former fragments now called the 'Moon' and 'Anulios. '
"Thanks to this, the completing process of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh
for the continuation of the species is carried out not through one being, as
with the tetartocosmoses, but through two beings of different sexes, called by
us 'actavas' and 'passavas,' and on the planet Earth, 'man' and 'woman. '
"I might say here that there even exists in our Great Megalocosmos a
planet on which this sacred law of Heptaparaparshinokh carries out its
completing process for the continuation of the species of the three-brained
beings through three independent individuals.
"You might as well be acquainted somewhat in detail with this uncommon
planet, which is called 'Modiktheo' and belongs to the system of the
Protocosmos.
"Beings arising on this planet are three-brained, like all those on the other
planets of our Great Megalocosmos, and in their outer appearance are very
similar to us, at the same time they are, and are considered by all others, the
most ideal and perfect of the innumerable forms of exterior coatings of three
brained beings of our Great Universe, and all our now existing angels,
archangels, and most of the Sacred Individuals nearest to our Common Father
Endlessness received their arising upon this marvelous planet.
"The transformation through them of the cosmic substances required for
the common-cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, according to the sacred law of
Heptaparaparshinokh, proceeds on the same principles on which it does in
our common presence and in the presence of your favorites breeding on the
planet Earth.
"It is solely for the continuation of their species that this sacred law carries out its completing process through three



kinds of beings, and that is why such three-brained beings are called
'triakrkomnian.' Just as among us, separate beings of different sexes are called
'actavas' and 'passavas,' and on your planet 'man' and 'woman,' so on the
planet Modiktheo the beings of the different sexes are called 'martna,' 'spirna,'
and 'okina,' and although externally they are all alike, their inner structures are
entirely different.
"The process of the continuation of their species takes place among them
in the following manner:
"All three beings of different sexes simultaneously receive the sacred
'elmooarno' or, as your favorites say, 'conception,' through a special action,
and with this sacred 'elmooarno' or conception they exist apart from one
another for a certain period, entirely independently, but each of them with
very definite intentional perceptions and conscious manifestations.
"And when the time draws closer for the results of these conceptions to
become manifest or, as they say on the Earth, when the moment of 'birth'
approaches, there appears in all three of these uncommon beings an
'aklonoatistian' longing for one another or, as your favorites would say, they
experience a 'psycho-organic attraction ' And the nearer the moment for this
being-manifestation or 'birth' approaches, the more closely they press together
and ultimately almost grow on to one another, and thereupon, at one and the
same time, they actualize in a certain way the results of these conceptions of
theirs.
"Well then, during this process all three conceptions suddenly merge into
one, and thus there appears in our Megalocosmos a new three-brained being
having this uncommon structure.
"And three-centered beings of this kind are indeed ideal in our
Megalocosmos because at their very arising they already have all three being
bodies.
"And this is so because the 'producers' of such a being,



namely martna, spirna, and okina, each separately conceive the arising of one
of the three being-bodies within themselves and, owing to their special
corresponding being-existences, aid the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh to form
the given being-body to perfection and, at the moment of 'birth,' to merge it
with the other bodies into one.
"Take note, by the way, my boy, that the beings arising on that
incomparable and marvelous planet have no need, unlike the three-brained
beings on the ordinary planets of our Megalocosmos, to coat their higher
being-bodies with the help of those factors designed by our Creator as a
means of perfecting themselves—factors we now call 'conscious labor' and
'intentional suffering. '
"And now, my dear Hassein, to give you a more detailed explanation of the
process of transformation of cosmic substances through beings in general, let
us take as an example the common presence of your favorites.
"Although the process of transformation of substances for the continuation
of the species no longer takes place either in us or in your favorites exactly as
it did in the first tetartocosmoses who were transformed into beings, we shall
nevertheless take your favorites as an example, since the transformation of
cosmic substances for the needs of the Most Great Common-Cosmic
Trogoautoegocrat proceeds through their common presence exactly as it did
through the first tetartocosmoses At the same time you will acquire some
information about several other minor details of their strange psyche, and also
about how, in general, they understand and regard their being-duty, in the
sense of serving the common-cosmic process of Iraniranumange— destroying
for the beatification of their own bellies everything provided according to law
and foreseen for the welfare of the whole Megalocosmos.



"As for the particularities of the transformation of cosmic substances,
owing to which at the present time the continuation of the species proceeds in
a different manner for different beings, I will now only say that the difference
depends on the place of concentration of the sacred 'ashagiprotoëhary,' that is,
on the place of concentration of those cosmic substances which are the results
of the last stopinder in the common-cosmic Ansanbaluiazar.
"Now, my boy, I shall repeat once more all your favorites, even the
contemporary ones, are—like us and like all the other three-centered beings
of our Megalocosmos—just such apparatuses for the Great Cosmic
Trogoautoegocrat as were the original tetartocosmoses from whom arose the
first ancestors of the beings now existing on the planet Earth as well as of
those on all the other planets of our Universe.
"Thus through each of them the cosmic substances arising in all seven
stopinders of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh could be transformed, and all of
them, even the contemporary ones, besides serving as apparatuses for the
Most Great Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, could have the possibility of absorbing
from the cosmic substances transformed through them everything required for
the coating and perfecting of both higher being-bodies For indeed, each three
brained being arising on this planet of yours represents in himself, in all
respects, as does every three-brained being in our Universe, an exact
similarity to the whole Megalocosmos.
"The difference between each of them and our Great Megalocosmos is only one of scale. "In this connection, you should know that your contemporary favorites are very fond of a notion they got hold of somewhere, which they either sense instinctively or repeat automatically, I don't know which, and express in the words 'We are made in the image of God. '



"These unfortunates do not even suspect that, of all their notions about
cosmic truths, this expression is the only true one.
"And indeed, each of them is the 'image of God'—not of that 'God' they
picture with their bob-tailed Reason, but of the real God, as we sometimes
call our common Megalocosmos.
"Each of them, down to the smallest detail, is exactly similar, though in
miniature, to the whole of our Megalocosmos, and in each of them there are
all the separate functionings which actualize in the Megalocosmos the cosmic
harmonious Iraniranumange, or 'exchange of substances,' maintaining the
existence of everything existing as one whole.
"This expression of theirs—'We are made in the image of God'—can serve
us here as a very good illustration of how far 'perceptive being-logic' or, as it
is sometimes called, 'aimnophnian mentation,' is already atrophied in them.
"Although this formulation corresponds to the truth, when they try to
express its exact meaning, it is the same here as it is in general with all their
verbal formulations, that is, even if they should wish actively and sincerely,
with their whole presence, to impart their inner representation and essential
understanding of it, what would come out of their strange shortsighted
mentation would at best be something of this sort .
'Good . . . if we are made "in the image of God" . . . that means . . . that means
. . . God is like us and also looks like us and that means our God has the same
moustache, beard, nose, as we have, and also wears clothes as we do He
wears clothes doubtless because He likes modesty, just as we do It was not for
nothing that He expelled Adam and Eve from Paradise only because they lost
their modesty and forgot their fig leaves.
"In some of the beings there, particularly of recent times,



their 'aimnophnian being-mentation,' or 'perceptive logic,' has deteriorated to such a point that in their picturings they can see this God of theirs very clearly, with a little comb sticking out of His left vest pocket, with which He sometimes combs His famous beard "This superpeculiar aimnophnian being-mentation about their God proceeded in your favorites chiefly as a result of the hasnamussian manifestations of those 'learned' beings who, as you remember, assembled in the city of Babylon and together began inventing various maleficent 'fictions' about that God of theirs, which by chance were afterward spread everywhere on that ill-fated planet, and since at that period the three-brained beings there were existing in a particularly 'selzelnualnian' manner, that is, particularly 'passively' as regards the being-efforts proper to three-centered beings, they thoroughly absorbed and appropriated these maleficent fictions. "Later, in their transmission from generation to generation, these fictions were gradually crystallized into such monstrous 'logicnestarian material' that, in the psyche of the contemporary three-brained beings, there began to proceed this exceptionally distorted, aimnophnian being-mentation. "And the reason why they picture their 'God' to themselves with a long beard is because, among the maleficent fictions of the 'learned beings' of Babylon, it was said, among other things, that that famous 'God' of theirs had the appearance of a venerable old man with a long flowing beard. "But in their imaginings about their 'God' your contemporary favorites have gone still further. They picture him as an 'old Jew,' since in their bobtailed notions all sacred personages come from that race. "Be that as it may, my little Hassein, each of your favorites in his whole
presence is, in every respect, exactly similar to our Megalocosmos.



"I once told you that in them, as in us, the head is the place of concentration of cosmic substances, the total functioning of which corresponds exactly to the totality of functions that our Most Holy Protocosmos fulfills for the entire Megalocosmos. "This concentration of substances, localized in their head, they call the 'head brain ' The separate 'ossaniaki' or poptoplasts' of this localization or, as terrestrial learned beings call them, 'brain cells,' are destined to fulfill exactly the same purpose for the whole presence of each of them as is fulfilled for the whole of our Great Universe by the perfected highest bodies of three-brained beings who have already united themselves with the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute or Protocosmos. "When these highest parts of three-brained beings, perfected to the corresponding gradation of Objective Reason, attain this union, they fulfill precisely that function of the 'ossaniaki' or 'cells of the head brain' which our Uni-Being Common Father Endlessness foresaw at the creation of the now existing world, when He graciously decided to use in the future those coatings that obtained independent individuality in the 'tetartocosmoses' as an aid for Himself in the administration of the enlarging world. "Further, in each of them, in what is called their 'spinal column,' another
concentration is localized, called the 'spinal marrow,' which contains those
'denying sources' that in their functioning fulfill precisely the same role in
relation to the head brain as the second-order newly arisen suns of the
Megalocosmos fulfill in relation to the Most Most Holy Protocosmos.
"It must be noted without fail that in former epochs on your planet your favorites knew something about the specific functioning of different parts of their 'spinal marrow,' and even knew and adopted various 'mechanical means' for acting upon corresponding parts of it, during periods when



some disharmony or other appeared in their 'psychic state,' as they express it,
but little by little the information relating to this sort of knowledge also
'evaporated' and, although your contemporary favorites know that there are
certain concentrations in this spinal marrow of theirs, they have not the
slightest notion for what function they were designed by Great Nature, and
simply name them 'nerve nodes of the spinal marrow.
"It is these nerve nodes of their spinal marrow that are the sources of denial
in relation to the various shades of affirmation in their 'head brain,' precisely
as the second-order suns are the sources of denial in relation to the various
shades of affirmation of the Most Most Holy Protocosmos.
"And just as in the Megalocosmos all the results issuing in the course of
the flow of the fundamental process of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh—on
the one hand from the affirmation of the Most Most Holy Protocosmos and on
the other from the various shades of denial of the newly created suns
thereafter serve as a 'reconciling principle' for everything newly arising and
already existing, so in your favorites also there exists a corresponding
localization for the concentration of all results issuing from the affirmation of
the 'head brain and from all the shades of denial of the 'spinal marrow', and
these results thereafter serve as a 'regulating' or 'reconciling principle' for the
functioning of the whole presence of each of them.
"As regards the place of concentration of this localization, which serves the
common presence of terrestrial three-brained beings as a 'regulating' or
'reconciling principle, it should be noted that in the beginning, in them as in
us, this third concentration existed in your favorites in the form of an
independent brain, localized in the region of what is called the 'breast.'
"But after the process of their ordinary being-existence began to change markedly for the worse, Great Nature, due



to certain causes flowing from the common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic
process, was compelled to change, without destroying its actual functioning,
the system of localization of this brain of theirs.
"That is to say, Great Nature gradually dispersed this organ, which had
been concentrated in one place, into small localizations over their whole
common presence, but chiefly in the region of what is called the 'pit of the
stomach.' They themselves at the present time call the totality of these small
localizations in this region the 'solar plexus,' or the 'complex of nodes of the
sympathetic nervous system.'
"In these nerve nodes scattered over the whole planetary body, all the
results obtained from the affirming manifestations of their 'head brain' and
denying manifestations of their 'spinal marrow' accumulate. And these results,
once they are fixed in the nerve nodes scattered over the whole of their
common presence, serve as the 'neutralizing principle' in the further process of
affirmation and denial between the head brain and spinal marrow, in the same
way as in the Megalocosmos the sum of all the results of the affirming
manifestations of the Protocosmos and the various shades of denial of the
newly arisen suns serve as the 'neutralizing force' in their further process of
affirmation and denial.
"And so, like ourselves, the three-brained beings of the planet Earth are not
only apparatuses—with the qualities of all three forces of the fundamental
common-cosmic Triamazikamno—for transforming cosmic substances re
quired for the Most Great Trogoautoegocrat, but also have the possibility,
while absorbing these substances coming from three independent sources, of
assimilating, in addition to the substances indispensable for their own
existence, certain substances destined for the coating and perfecting of their
own higher being-bodies.
"In this way those three-sourced substances entering their



common presence for transformation are, for them just as for us, a threefold
being-food.
"In other words, those substances which, on the path of their returning
evolutionary ascent toward the Most Holy Protocosmos from the sacred
'ashagiprotoëhary'—that is, from the last stopinder of the fundamental sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh—are converted with the aid of their own planet into
higher corresponding surplanetary formations, enter the three-brained beings
for further transformation as their 'first being-food,' namely, their ordinary
'food' and 'drink. '
"The 'second-sourced' substances, arising from the transformations of their
own sun and of all the other planets of their solar system, and which penetrate
the atmosphere of their planet through the radiations of the latter, enter into
them for further evolutionary transformation, again just as with us, as the
'second being-food,' which is, as they say, the 'air' they breathe, and it is these
substances in the air that serve for the coating and maintenance of the
existence of their 'second being-body. '
"Finally, the substances of the 'first source' which, for them as well as for
us, are a third kind of being-food serve for the coating and perfecting of the
'highest being-body' itself.
"But alas, it was in relation to these sacred cosmic substances that those
sorrowful results occurred and continue to occur among your unfortunate
favorites from all the abnormalities established by them in the ordinary
process of their being-existence.
"Although these sacred substances of the higher being-food have never
ceased to enter into them, they enter, particularly in contemporary beings,
only spontaneously, without any participation of their conscious intention, and
only in the amount required for the transformations pro



ceeding through them for the purposes of the common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic harmony and for the automatic continuation of their species demanded by Nature. "When the abnormal conditions of ordinary being-existence were finally fixed there—with the result that both the instinctive and the intentional striving for self-perfecting disappeared from their essence—they not only ceased to feel the need to absorb these cosmic substances consciously, but even lost the knowledge and understanding of the existence and significance of 'higher being-foods.' "At the present time, your favorites only know about the first being-food, and they know about that simply because, in the first place, willy-nilly, they cannot help knowing about it, and, secondly, their use of it has already become a vice for them, and occupies an equal place alongside the other weaknesses that have gradually been crystallized in them as consequences of the properties of the maleficent organ kundabuffer. "Up to this time not one of them has even become aware that this 'first being-food' is composed almost exclusively of substances necessary for the maintenance of the existence of their coarse planetary body, which is a denying source, and that this 'first being-food' can provide almost nothing for the higher parts of their presence. "As for the higher cosmic substances of which a certain quantity must of
necessity be transformed through them for the continuation of their species
and for the maintenance of the general harmony of the common-cosmic
'Ansanbaluiazar,' your contemporary favorites have no need at all to disturb
their 'inner god,' self-calming, about it since, as I have already said, this
transformation proceeds quite spontaneously in them, without the
participation of their own conscious intention.
"It is interesting to note, however, that in the beginning,



that is, soon after the destruction of the organ kundabuffer in the three-brained beings breeding on this planet of yours, they knew about these two higher being-foods and made use of them with conscious intention, and certain beings of the continent of Atlantis, during its final period, even considered the process of the absorption of these higher being-foods as the chief aim of their existence. "The beings of the continent of Atlantis then named the second being-food 'amarloos,' which meant 'help for the moon,' and they named the third beingfood the sacred 'amarkhoodan,' which signified for them 'help for God.' "As regards the absence in the psyche of your contemporary favorites of a
conscious need of absorbing these higher sacred cosmic substances, I wish to
draw your attention to one very important consequence, very sorrowful for
them.
"The fact is that when they ceased to absorb intentionally the cosmic substances necessary for the arising and existence of the higher being-parts, the very striving for self-perfection disappeared from their common presence, as well as the capacity for what is called 'intentional contemplation,' which is the principal factor for the assimilation of those sacred cosmic substances So from then on, in order to make sure that the required quantity of these substances would enter them and be assimilated, Nature gradually had to adapt herself and arrange that, in the course of the whole process of their existence, such 'unexpectednesses' should occur to each of them as are not at all proper to occur to any three-brained being of our Great Megalocosmos. "And poor Nature had to adapt herself to this abnormality so that, due to these unexpectednesses, certain intense being-experiencings and active deliberations might proceed in them automatically, independently of them themselves, and so that, due to these active deliberations, the required trans



formation and assimilation of the necessary sacred particles of the higher
being-foods might also proceed in them automatically.
"Now, my boy, let us go into the actual processes of transformation taking
place in the evolutionary and involutionary movements of all these cosmic
substances through just such apparatuses for serving the Most Great
Common-Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat as your favorites are In them, as in us, as
well as in all large and small cosmoses of our common Megalocosmos, these
transformations proceed strictly according to the two fundamental cosmic
laws, the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh and the sacred Triamazikamno.
"Before telling you how the cosmic substances entering into beings as
their 'first being-food' are transformed in them for the purposes of the
common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process, and also serve, provided the
beings have a certain attitude toward this process, for the coating and
perfecting of their own higher parts, you should bear in mind, for a clear
representation of all this, that in our Megalocosmos— from results issuing
from every kind of trogoautoegocratic process—there are many hundreds of
independent 'active elements' having various specific subjective properties
that take part in new formations.
"Wherever they may be, these many hundreds of 'active elements' with
various properties, issuing from the seven stopinders of the fundamental,
common-cosmic sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, are divided and localized
depending upon the stopinder from which they arose—into seven what are
called 'okhtapanatzakhian' classes according to their 'affinity of vibrations '
And all definite concentrations of our Megalocosmos, both large and small,
are formed out of active elements belonging to these seven independent
classes that have, as I have just said, their own subjective properties.
"These subjective properties, including what is called their



'proportionate force of vivifyingness,' are determined first by the form of
functioning of the fifth stopinder of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh that was
flowing during their arising, and second, by the conditions in which those
active elements were formed, whether as the result of the conscious intention
of some independent individual or simply automatically, owing to the second
order cosmic law named the 'attraction and fusion of similarities. '
"Well then, these many hundreds of definite active elements belonging to
the seven okhtapanatzakhian classes, each having seven different subjective
properties—among which the properties of 'vivifyingness' and 'decomposition'
are of prime significance—compose in their totality the fundamental,
common-cosmic Ansanbaluiazar, through which is actualized the Most Great
Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, that true savior from the law-conformable action of
the merciless Heropass.
"It is necessary to tell you also that in accordance with this second-order
cosmic law, the 'attraction and fusion of similarities,' the first appearance of
concentrations of every kind formed from the ethernokrilno present
everywhere in the Universe proceeds in the following manner:
"If particles of ethernokrilno, already present in the different spheres of all
seven stopinders of the fundamental, common-cosmic Ansanbaluiazar, for
some reason or other collide, they combine and give rise to all kinds of
'crystallizations' that do not yet have any subjective properties, but if these
combined particles of ethernokrilno happen to fall into conditions where a
process of 'harnel-miatznel' is taking place, they fuse with one another and,
according to the nature of their vibrations, are transformed into active
elements now having specific properties.
"Thereafter, if these active elements with their own specific subjective
properties enter into other processes of 'harnel-miatznel' under different
conditions, they again fuse



with each other according to the same law of affinity of vibrations, and thus
acquiring new properties, are transformed into active elements of another
okhtapanatzakhian class, and so on and so forth.
"That is why, in our Megalocosmos, there are so many independent active
elements with their different specific subjective properties .
"And if now, my boy, you can satisfactorily grasp the stages of the process
of transformation of cosmic substances by means of 'beings-apparatuses,' into
which these substances enter as first being-food, you will at the same time
have an approximate understanding of everything relating to the chief
particularities of the sacred Law of Heptaparaparshinokh as well as the
processes of evolution and involution of the higher being-foods.
"When these evolving active elements, in their returning ascent from the
last stopinder of the fundamental, common-cosmic sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, enter into the common presence of 'beings-apparatuses'
as their first being-food, they begin on entering the mouth itself gradually to
be changed through the process of the second-order law of 'harnel-miatznel'
that is, they mix and fuse, according to 'affinity of vibrations,' with active
elements that have already evolved in the presence of the beings and have
acquired vibrations corresponding to the subsequent stopinders of the being
Heptaparaparshinokh And then, when they reach the stomach of the beings
they are transformed into specific active elements named 'being-protoëhary,'
which correspond in their vibrations to the ascending fourth stopinder of the
fundamental, sacred common-cosmic Heptaparaparshinokh.
"From there, this totality of active elements, whose 'center of gravity of
vibrations' is that of 'being-protoëhary,' gradually evolves and, again thanks to
the process of harnel-miatznel, acquires corresponding vibrations in what is
called



the 'duodenum' and is completely transformed this time into 'beingdeuteroëhary. "Then, passing through the whole of what is called the 'intestinal tract,' one
part of these definite substances of being-deuteroëhary is used for the needs
of the planetary body itself as well as for the local harnel-miatznel to which
all newly entering food is subject, but the other part, also by means of a
process of harnel-miatznel of local character, continues its independent
evolution and is ultimately transformed into the still higher specific
substances called 'being-tritoëhary.
"This totality of cosmic substances, temporarily crystallized in the
common presence of the 'beings-apparatuses,' and corresponding in its
vibrations to 'being-tritoëhary,' has as its principal place of concentration what
is called the 'liver. '
"It is just at this place of the 'being-Ansanbaluiazar' that the 'lower mdnel
in' of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, called the 'mechano-coinciding mdnel
in,' is located, and therefore the substances of 'being-tritoëhary' cannot evolve
further independently, solely by the process of harnel-miatznel.
"Indeed, because of the change in the general functioning of the
primordial, common-cosmic sacred Law of Heptaparaparshinokh, this totality
of substances named 'being-tritoëhary' can evolve further only with the help
of forces coming from outside.
"So if these substances of 'being-tritoëhary' do not receive any help from
outside for their further evolution in the common presence of beings, then
both this totality of substances and all those center-of-gravity substances of
the being-Ansanbaluiazar crystallized up to this stage must always involve
back again into those specific cosmic crystallizations from which they began
their evolution.
"To provide this help from outside, Great Nature most



wisely adapted the inner organization of beings in such a manner that the
substances which had to enter into their common presence for the coating and
feeding of their 'second being-body,' or 'kesdjan body,' that is, the totality of
cosmic substances your favorites call 'air,' could at the same time serve as the
outer help required for the evolution of the substances of the 'first being-food. '
"The active elements that compose this 'second being-food,' or 'air,' enter
the presence of beings through the nose and, gradually evolving with the
cooperation of various processes of harnel-miatznel of local character, are
transformed in what are called the 'lungs' into 'protoëhary,' but this time into
'astralnomian-protoëhary. '
"And then the substances of this 'astralnomianprotoëhary,' entering into the
presence of beings for their own evolution and still having in themselves,
according to the Sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, all the possibilities of evolving
from their centers of gravity by the process of harnel-miatznel alone, mix with
the totality of substances of the first being-food which have already evolved
up to the third stopinder of the sacred being-Heptaparaparshinokh, and further
evolve together, and thus help these substances of the first being-food to pass
through the lower 'mechano-coinciding mdnel-in' and to be transmuted into
other definite substances, named 'being-tetartoëhary,' while the 'astralnomian
protoëhary' itself is transmuted into the substances named 'astralnomian
deuteroëhary. '
"So, my boy, at this point I can give you one more illustration of the
difference between Autoegocrat and Trogoautoegocrat, that is, of the
difference between the former 'autoegocratic' system of maintaining the
existence of the Sun Absolute and the 'trogoautoegocratic' system established
at the creation of the Megalocosmos.
"If the transformation of substances through 'beings-apparatuses' were to
proceed according to the law of the



sacred Heptaparaparshinokh as it was before certain of its stopinders were
modified, that is, as it functioned before the creation of our now existing
Megalocosmos, the cosmic substances composing the 'first being-food,' on
entering such an 'apparatus-cosmos' for the local process of evolution, would
continue their ascent up to their complete transformation into specific, 'higher
active elements' without any hindrance or any need of help coming from
outside, by the process of harnel-miatznel alone But now, since the inde
pendent functioning of this primordial sacred law has been changed into a
dependent one, the evolution and involution of substances through its
changed stopinders must always be dependent upon externally caused
manifestations coming from outside.
"In this case, the outer help for the complete transformation through
beings of these cosmic crystallizations into 'higher crystallizations' is the
'second being-food,' which has an entirely different origin and must actualize
entirely different cosmic results.
"Some time later I will explain to you in detail how the transformation of
the substances of the second and third being-foods takes place in beings, but
meanwhile note only that these higher cosmic substances are transformed
according to exactly the same principles as the substances of the first being
food.
"Now we shall continue to investigate just how, according to the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, the transformation of the substances of their first
being-food proceeds in the presence of 'beings-apparatuses.'
"As I have already said, the ordinary first being-food is thus gradually
transformed into specific substances called 'being-tetartoëhary,' which in
beings, as of course also in your favorites, have as the central place of their
concentration the two 'hemispheres of their head brain. '
"One part of this 'being-tetartoëhary,' localized in both



hemispheres of their head brain, is utilized unchanged for the planetary body
of the being, but the other part, having in itself all the possibilities for
independent evolution without help coming from outside, continues to evolve,
and mixing again through the process of harnel-miatznel with previously
formed higher substances already present in the beings, it is gradually
transformed into still higher specific 'active elements' called 'being-pentoëhary.'
"These substances have as the central place of their concentration in beings
what is called the 'sianoorinam,' which is also located in the head, your
favorites call this part of their planetary body the 'cerebellum.'
"In accordance with the fifth deflection of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh,
it is these very substances that are free to produce, in the manifestations of the
common presence of three-brained beings, results not similar but always
opposite to each other.
"That is why, with respect to these being-substances, the beings must
always be very, very much on their guard in order to avoid undesirable
consequences for their entire whole.
"From the 'cerebellum,' one part of these specific substances is also utilized
for the needs of the planetary body, but the other part, passing in a 'particular
way' through the nerve nodes of the spine and breast, is concentrated, in the
beings of the male sex, in the 'testicles' and, in the beings of the female sex, in
the 'ovaries,' which are the places of concentration in the common presence of
beings of 'being-exioëhary,' which is for them their most sacred possession
Incidentally, bear in mind that the 'particular way' I mentioned is called 'trnlva.'
"And it is only after this that the cosmic substances that enter 'beings
apparatuses'' for the purpose of evolution, that is, for the possibility of passing
the 'lower mdnel-in' of the fundamental common-cosmic exchange of
substances, are



transformed into that definite totality of cosmic substances whose production
is the automatic justification of the sense and aim of the existence of all
beings in general, and in particular of the contemporary three-brained beings
breeding on the planet Earth. And everywhere in the Universe this totality of
cosmic substances is called 'exioëhary.'
"So, my boy, this totality of cosmic substances named 'exioëhary,'
resulting from the evolution of the first being-food in these beings
apparatuses, corresponds in its vibrations to the last stopinder of the being
Heptaparaparshinokh and, according to the particularity of this stopinder, it
enters the 'higher intentionally actualizing mdnel-in' of the law of
Heptaparaparshinokh And in order to complete its transformation into new
higher substances and acquire vibrations corresponding to the next higher
degree of vivifyingness, that is, corresponding to the fifth stopinder of the
fundamental process of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, it indispensably
requires just that outside help which can be obtained in the presence of three
brained beings only through those factors mentioned by me more than once,
and which are manifested in 'being-partkdolgduty', in other words, those
factors which our Common Father Creator Endlessness consented to
designate as the means by which certain tetartocosmoses—as a final result of
their service to the purposes of the common-cosmic Iraniranumange— could
become helpers in the administration of the enlarging world And as for these
factors, which are the sole possible means for the assimilation of the cosmic
substances required for the coating and perfecting of the higher being-bodies,
today we call them 'conscious labor' and 'intentional suffering. '
"Here it might be worth while to note and even to emphasize that of all the
definite cosmic substances that are formed and are always to be found in the
common presence of your favorites, they know well only this 'being



exioëhary,' which they call 'sperm,' and even masterfully perform with it
various kinds of their 'manipulations.'
"And by this name 'sperm' they give importance to the totality of definite
substances formed only in the presence of beings of the male sex, scorning
and leaving nameless a similar totality of the 'end results' of the substances
arising in beings of the female sex.
"Well then, ever since your favorites ceased to actualize being
partkdolgduty in their presence, this totality of substances, which inevitably
arises in the presence of all beings as the final result of the transformation of
their first being-food, no longer receiving, in accordance with the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, the outside help required for completing its evolution
into other higher definite active elements, began to involve back toward those
crystallizations from which its evolution began From then on, such
involutionary processes in the common presence of your favorites became
factors engendering in them data for the arising of their innumerable
'illnesses,' thus, on the one hand, breaking down their previously established
essence-individuality and, on the other hand, shortening the general duration
of their existence.
"Your favorites, the beings of the planet Earth, particularly those of the
present time, no longer use these substances of 'being-exioëhary' at all
consciously, either for self-perfecting or for the reproduction of a new being
similar to themselves.
"And so these sacred cosmic substances formed in them either serve only
for the purposes of the Most Great Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, without any
participation of their own being-consciousness and individual desire, or for
the involuntary conception of a new being like themselves who is for them
without their cognized wish a distressing result of the fusion of those sacred
substances of the two opposite



sexes, representing two opposite forces of the sacred Triamazikamno—a fusion taking place during the satisfaction of that function of theirs which, thanks to the 'inheritance' from the ancient Romans, has become the chief vice of contemporary three-brained beings. "I must remark, my boy, with sadness, that this depraved tendency, already firmly fixed in their common presence is, particularly for your contemporary favorites, a means of automatically destroying to their very root even those impulses that on rare occasions give rise to manifestations worthy of threebrained beings, and evoke in them what is called the 'thirst for Being. ' "I repeat, my boy, not only have these favorites of yours, particularly the contemporary ones, ceased to make conscious use of these sacred substances, inevitably formed in them, for the coating and perfecting of their 'higher parts' and for the fulfillment of that being-duty foreseen by Nature which consists in the continuation of their species, but when this latter does accidentally occur, they regard it as a great misfortune for themselves, because its consequences must for a certain time hinder the free gratification of the many and various vices fixed in their essence "And so in consequence of this, particularly at the present time, they strive
with their whole presence and by every means to prevent the actualization of
this involuntary and accidental, yet sacred, manifestation foreseen by Great
Nature .
"In the last few centuries there, a great many of them, in whom data for all
kinds of 'hasnamussian properties' were more strongly crystallized than in
others, even became specialists in aiding the destruction of these
unintentionally actualized sacred being-fulfillments, and these specialists are
called 'makers of angels. '
"Yet this 'being-act,' which your favorites have turned



into their chief vice, is considered everywhere in our Great Universe, by beings of all natures, as the most sacred of all divine sacraments. "Even many two-brained and one-brained beings of the planet Earth, such as the beings called 'hyenas,' 'cats,' 'wolves,' 'lions,' 'tigers,' 'wild dogs,' 'baigooshis,' 'frogs,' and many others, who in their 'law-conformable presences' have no data at all for 'comparative logic,' still continue, of course only instinctively, to sense this act as sacred, and fulfill it only during those periods ordained by Great Nature for this holy sacrament, that is, chiefly during the period which is the beginning of a new cycle of that cosmic concentration on which they arise and exist—the period called, by three-brained beings everywhere, the 'dianosks of the holy sacrament of the great Serooazar,' known on the planet which interests you as 'spring days.'
"Perhaps, my boy, you do not yet know anything about the 'holy sacrament of the great Serooazar'?" Beelzebub asked his grandson. To this question of Beelzebub, Hassein replied "No, dear Grandfather, I do not yet know the details of this, I only know that these dianosks are regarded among us on the planet Karatas as great, holy days and are called 'helpingGod dianosks' And I also know that almost as soon as these great holy days are past, all our beings, 'actavas' as well as 'passavas,' begin to prepare themselves for the next ones, and that one 'loonias' before the beginning of this sacred mystery both old and young cease to introduce the 'first beingfood' into themselves and, through various sacred ceremonies, mentally give thanks to our Common Creator for their existence. "I also know that the last two of these solemn dianosks are known among us as the 'dianosks for glorifying the progenitor of each family



"And that is why, dear Grandfather, every year during these dianosks we
all remembered and spoke only of you, and each one of us strove with his
whole being to manifest the sincere wish that your destiny may constantly
create for you conditions of being-existence that will help you quickly and
without hindrance to bring your Reason up to the required sacred gradation,
and that thereby you may the sooner finish your present 'ordinary being
existence,' personally burdensome for you.
With these last, solemnly pronounced words, Hassein fell silent .
"Very well, my boy," said Beelzebub "We will talk about the 'holy
sacrament of Serooazar' when we return to our dear Karatas.
"There I will explain to you in detail where and how the holy sacrament of
Serooazar for the continuation of the species is fulfilled with the substances of
'being-exioëhary,' and on what occasions and in what way the fusion and
subsequent results of the two kinds of 'being-exioëhary' are obtained one kind
is transformed as affirming principle through 'beings-apparatuses'' known on
our planet Karatas as 'actavas' and on your planet Earth as beings of the 'male
sex', and the other kind is transformed as denying principle through 'beings
apparatuses'' known on the planet Karatas as 'passavas' and on the planet
Earth as beings of the 'female sex. '
"Now let us talk about the perfected 'highest being-bodies,' or 'souls,' who
came to this Holy Planet Purgatory, to which all my explanations have
referred.
"Well . . . "At the beginning, when all the higher being-parts arose and were
perfected in beings up to the required sacred gradation of Objective Reason
that is to say, when in accordance with the 'lower mdnel-in' of the sacred
Hepta



paraparshinokh, thanks to the second being-food the 'kesdjan body' was
formed in beings, and in accordance with the 'higher mdnel-in' of the same
sacred law, thanks to the third being-food the third and highest 'being-body'
was coated and perfected—then these completely perfected highest being
parts, after their separation from the lower being-parts, were deemed worthy
to be immediately united with the Most Most Holy Prime Source and began to
fulfill the purpose divinely foreordained for them.
"And thus it continued right up to the time of that terrifying cosmic event
which, as I have already told you, is now called the 'chootboglitanical period '
"Before that common-cosmic misfortune, all the 'highest being-bodies' that
arose and were perfected in certain tetartocosmoses and in their first
descendants were immediately united with the Most Most Holy Protocosmos
itself, because their common presences were still actualizing the results fully
corresponding to it.
"Before this terrifying cosmic event, the sacred Theomertmalogos that
issued from the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute was still in a pure state,
without any admixture of extraneously caused arisings having their own
subjective properties, and when this sacred Theomertmalogos entered the
spheres of those planets on which the sacred crystallizations arose, whose
transformations through 'beings-apparatuses'' served for the coating and
perfecting of higher being-bodies, these latter acquired presences exactly
corresponding to the required conditions of existence in the sphere of the Most
Most Holy Sun Absolute.
"But after that common-cosmic misfortune, on account of which the sacred
Theomertmalogos began to issue from the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute with
the admixture of subjective properties coming from extraneously caused aris
ings, from that time on, the sacred 'highest being-bodies' no longer had the
possibility of corresponding to the re



quired conditions of existence in the sphere of the Most Most Holy Prime Source. "This admixture of extraneously caused arisings took place in the sacred Theomertmalogos owing to the following and, I must add, unforeseen causes "When each perfected 'highest being-body' becomes an independent Individual and acquires its own law of the sacred Triamazikamno, it begins to emanate similarly to the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, but in miniature And when a great many of these perfected independent Sacred Individuals had been assembled on the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, then between the emanations of these Sacred Individuals and the atmosphere of the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute there was established what is called a 'geneotriamazikamnian contact, ' which brought on this terrible misfortune for the 'perfected highest being-parts' of which I have just told you. "To be sure, the action of the results of this 'geneotriamazikamnian contact' soon became harmonized with the already existing action of our Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, and, from then on, the emanations of the sacred Theomertmalogos had to be changed, and the first consequences of this disastrous contact brought about a change in the harmonious movement of many solar systems and produced a disharmony in the inner functioning of certain of their planets. "It was just then that there broke away from the solar system Khlartoomano that famous planet with quite exceptional particularities, which exists alone in space, at the present time this planet is called 'Remorse of Conscience. ' "This 'geneotriamazikamnian contact' consisted in this in the atmosphere of the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute unusual vibrations of diverse origin began, as I have already said, to emanate from these highest being-bodies and, uniting with the emanations of the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, penetrated with them everywhere in the Megalo



cosmos and reached certain planets on which highest being-bodies were
continuing to arise in beings And these unusual vibrations began to be
transformed and crystallized with the sacred Theomertmalogos, thus
participating in the coating of the 'highest parts' of these beings.
"And from that time on, these sacred arisings contained special properties
in their presences, due to the fact that certain manifestations of the other parts
of the being in whom these sacred arisings were being coated began to enter
and be assimilated in the composition of these higher parts, producing very
unusual results which came to be called, and are called even now, 'sins of the
body of the soul. '
"It was just on account of those unusual results that these cosmic
formations, even if perfected to the required gradation of Objective Reason,
ceased to correspond in their common presences to the conditions of existence
in the sphere of the Most Most Holy Protocosmos, and from then on lost the
possibility of being deemed worthy to unite themselves with it.
"Well then, as soon as the facts became known about the helpless position
of these highest being-bodies who had become 'independent cosmic Sacred
Individuals,' perfected in Reason, but whose presences no longer
corresponded to the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, our All-Loving Creator,
in His infinite justice and mercy, at once took all the corresponding measures
demanded by this unforeseen and sorrowful phenomenon.
"This grievous phenomenon indeed placed these Sacred Individuals in a
desperate situation because they had no possibility, on account of those 'sins'
in their presences, of uniting with the Bosom of the Prime Source of the Great
Whole, yet at the same time, having attained that gradation of the sacred Scale
of Reason which subjects them to the second-order cosmic law named
'tetetzender,' they had lost



the possibility of free existence on the surface of ordinary planets. "Among the various divine measures undertaken was the issuance of His decree to choose the very best planet in the whole of our Great Megalocosmos, to adapt its surface in a special manner, and to reserve it for the further free existence of these highest being-bodies that were perfected in Reason, so that they might have all the possibilities of purifying themselves from the undesirable elements in their presences. "It was then that for the first time this holy planet received the name of 'Purgatory,' and its chief organization and government were undertaken at his own wish by our All-Quarters Maintainer, the Great Arch-Cherub Helkgematios, that same great Helkgematios who after the creation of the world first merited the sacred Anklad, that is, first attained that degree of Reason which is the highest that can be attained by an independent Individual, whatever his nature, and which is the third degree below the Absolute Reason of our Endlessness. "Although this holy planet is indeed the very best in every respect, as you have seen for yourself, and everything on its surface is of such a quality that it is always perceived, as I have already said, 'iskoloonizinernly,' in other words, 'bliss-fully-delightfully,' by each independent Individual, yet for these perfected highest being-bodies who exist there this is of no account, since they are always deeply absorbed in their intense work of purifying themselves from those undesirable elements which have entered their presences for reasons totally foreign to their individuality. "In the common presences of these unfortunate highest being-bodies, perfected in Reason to the highest limit attainable by ordinary higher cosmic Individuals, there is one single datum which occasionally engenders in them the impulse of hope that they may at some time purify themselves



and have the happiness of uniting with, and becoming a particle of, that
'Greatness' which our Omnipotent All-Just Common Father Endlessness
actualizes for the welfare and happiness of everything existing in our
Megalocosmos.
"Here it is interesting to note that almost all the three-brained beings arising
on the various planets of our Megalocosmos either know of or instinctively
sense the existence of the Holy Planet Purgatory, it is only the three-brained
beings on your planet who remain unaware of it, or at least the majority of
those who arose shortly before the loss of the continent of Atlantis and since
its disappearance.
"As soon as the three-brained beings of our Megalocosmos, irrespective of
exterior coating, acquire any degree of self-awareness, they begin to dream
consciously or instinctively of going to that holy planet, so that later they may
have the happiness of becoming a particle of that Greatness with which
sooner or later every essence is destined to blend.
"And for the realization of these dreams of theirs, those three-brained
beings who have attained a greater self-awareness always eagerly and even
joyfully accept those unpleasantnesses to their presence coming from
privations suffered by their planetary bodies during their ordinary being
existence, because they well understand and instinctively feel that their 'lower
being-body' is, in their own sacred cosmic law of Triamazikamno, the
indispensable source of denying manifestations of all kinds, and as such must
always manifest itself negatively toward their affirming part, in other words,
the manifestations of this lower part of theirs must necessarily always be
opposed to what is required by their highest being-part.
"Thus every wish of the planetary body is taken as undesirable for the
highest divine part that has to be coated and perfected, and that is why all the
three-centered beings of our Great Megalocosmos constantly carry on a
relentless



struggle against the desires of their planetary bodies, so that through this 'disputekrialnian friction,' as it is called, the sacred crystallizations should be formed in them for the arising and perfecting of this highest divine being-part. "In this constant struggle of theirs, the equilibrating, harmonizing principle is their second being-body which, in their own individual law of Triamazikamno, represents the neutralizing source, and therefore this second being-part always remains indifferent to their mechanical manifestations, but during their active manifestations it always tends, in accordance with the second-order cosmic law of 'oordekhplifata,' to unite with those desires of which there are more, whether in one or the other of the two opposite beingparts.
"As I have already said, in the beginning—that is, before the loss of the continent of Atlantis—the three-brained beings of your planet also had an approximate understanding of the Holy Planet Purgatory, and there even existed several legomonisms about it After the loss of that continent certain fragments of these legomonisms were preserved intact by learned beings of that time who happened to survive, and these fragments began to be transmitted from generation to generation. "But later, when that peculiar disease of theirs which I characterized by the word 'wiseacring' arose in the psyche of these strange three-brained beings, they began to wiseacre with this fragmentary information about the Holy Planet Purgatory in such a way that, in the psyche of beings of subsequent generations, representations and conceptions began to be formed and fixed which are defined to perfection by a certain exclamation of our highly esteemed, incomparable Mullah Nasr Eddin, consisting of the following being-sound 'tchoort-zoo-oort!' "And as for those fragments of the legomonisms concerning the holy planet which continued to be transmitted



from generation to generation through genuine initiates there, they came
down almost unchanged to a relatively recent epoch, that is, to what is called
the 'Babylonian epoch', but then, owing to the agitation of mind that seized
everyone in Babylon and was due, as I have already told you, to the learned
beings of 'new formation' with various properties unbecoming to three
brained beings, these fragments gradually became distorted and ultimately
turned to dust.
"In spite of the fact that the initiates of that epoch were still relatively
normal responsible beings who did not change their ideals as easily as most
contemporary beings—for instance, as easily as the 'London fou-fou-klé''
change their gloves—yet the psychosis which then seized all these strange
three-brained beings, in their desire to find out at any cost whether they had a
'soul' and whether it was immortal, was so strong and so widespread that this
unhealthy need of their psyche stirred up and infected the minds of even the
genuine initiates there, who under the influence of this psychosis introduced
into the legomonism relating to the Holy Planet Purgatory such a
'khaboorchooboor' that, from sheer pleasure, the tail of our Lucifer turned a
shade of the color 'tango. '
"The confusion in the minds of the initiated beings of the planet Earth at
that time came about, in my opinion, chiefly because of that beautiful theory
of the Babylonian dualists, according to which there exist in some other world
a 'paradise' and a 'hell.'
"And it was just these two expressions, namely, 'paradise' and 'hell,' which
in my opinion were the cause of all the subsequent twaddle.
"The point is that one of the legomonisms about the Holy Planet Purgatory
indeed contained both of these words, 'paradise' and 'hell. '
"But I do not know whether the two words used by the



Babylonian dualists were taken directly from the legomonism or whether they were used by coincidence. "Be that as it may, in the legomonisms about the Holy Planet Purgatory
these two words express the following concepts the word 'paradise' referred to
the magnificence and richness of that holy planet, and the word 'hell' referred
to that inner state experienced by the highest being-bodies who dwell there
that is, a state of constant anguish, grief, and oppression.
"One of the legomonisms even gave a detailed explanation of the causes of
this state of theirs, it was said that these 'highest being-parts,' or 'souls,' having
finally reached this holy planet after incredible sufferings and conscious
labors, and having seen and understood the reality and significance of
everything existing, and above all seeing our Common Father Endlessness
Himself so near and so often, became aware that because of the undesirable
elements present in them, they were still unable to help Him in the fulfillment
of His most sacred tasks for the good of our whole Megalocosmos.
"And so, those two words were evidently just why the poor initiates of that
time, infected by the general psychosis, imagined that in that fantastic and
beautiful theory of the future 'Babylonian hasnamusses' the same things were
spoken of, only more fully, and they then began half-consciously to insert
certain details from this fantastic theory into the legomonisms concerning the
holy planet After-ward, all this information, passing from generation to gen
eration, blossomed out with such embellishments as our dear Mullah Nasr
Eddin expresses by the one word, 'khralkanatonschachermacher. '
"After what I have just told you, my boy, you can judge what kind of notions and images exist nowadays on your planet about what is called the 'question of the beyond', it can truly be said that if these concepts and notions of your



eccentrics were heard by our hens, they would laugh so hysterically that the same thing might happen to them as happens to your favorites when they take what is called 'castor oil. ' "So that you may better sense and understand, and at the same time for a better fairylike illumination of the meaning of the expressions I just used, 'hen's laughter' and 'castor oil,' I must tell you about another consequence of that 'cunning wiseacring' of these favorites of yours, in this case concerning the question of 'being-exioëhary,' as this will give you additional data for elucidating by a concrete example certain particularities that I have already indicated of the fundamental, sacred cosmic law of Heptaparaparshinokh. "After the loss of the continent of Atlantis, certain knowledge concerning the origin and significance of this same 'being-exioëhary' also survived, and this too passed from generation to generation. "Well, about thirty or thirty-five of their centuries ago, after one of their big processes of reciprocal destruction, when most of your favorites, as usually happens there after these terrible excesses, again began to see reality more often and to be less satisfied with the conditions of their ordinary existence, it so happened that certain of them, who had sensed very strongly the emptiness of their existence and were seeking a means of somehow filling this emptiness, found out about these surviving fragments of knowledge bearing on the authentic significance of 'being-exioëhary. ' "In this fragmentary, yet authentic information, it was very convincingly indicated that by means of the substance 'exioëhary,' or 'sperm,' formed in them, it was possible to perfect oneself, but unfortunately for them they found no indications in these surviving fragments of what had to be done and precisely how it was to be done.
"Certain of them then began to think and strive persist



ently to understand somehow what must be done in order to work for selfperfection by means of this substance inevitably formed in their presence. "These serious ponderings of theirs led them to the conviction that self
perfecting could doubtless be actualized simply by abstaining from the
ejection, in the habitual manner, of this substance formed in them, called
'sperm,' and certain of them decided to unite and exist together, in order to
verify in practice whether such abstinence could indeed give the expected
results.
"But however hard these beings of your planet who were the first to be
interested in this question strove to clarify it, they arrived at nothing, and it
was only their descendants of the second generation, after long conscious
observations and intensive active mentation, who at last categorically
understood that this was indeed possible, but exclusively on condition of the
ceaseless fulfillment of being-partkdolgduty-duty And certain of the beings of
this second generation, as well as of the two subsequent generations, after
seriously devoting themselves to this, did indeed attain the expected results.
"But from the fourth generation on, those beings who were still interested
in this question were no longer followers from essence-conviction but from a
property called 'imitation,' which by that time had become inherent in these
terrestrial three-brained beings—yet they also began to exist together and to
do, as it were, the same thing.
"So from that time and even down to the present, these adepts
automatically continue to organize themselves in separate groups, and
sometimes form substantial sects of different denominations and, basing their
aim on this 'abstinence,' exist together in isolated communities.
"These places of theirs for segregated communal existence are called
'monasteries,' and the beings belonging to these sects, 'monks.'



"At the present time, very many of these monasteries exist there, and the large number of monks who enter them do indeed strictly abstain from the ejection, in the habitual way, of the 'being-exioëhary,' or 'sperm,' formed in them, but of course this abstinence of theirs never gives any sensible result And this is because the thought never enters the heads of these hapless contemporary 'monks' that, although it is indeed possible to perfect themselves by means of this substance, this can proceed only if the second and third being-foods are intentionally absorbed and consciously digested in one's presence, which is possible only for one who has already accustomed all the parts of his presence to fulfill consciously both 'sacred beingpartkdolgduties,' that is, 'conscious labor' and 'intentional suffering.' "It is, however, unjust to say that no 'sensible result' at all is obtained by these monks. They have even obtained 'sensible results' of two independent kinds. "So that you may understand why the abstinence of these contemporary monks produces two different kinds of results, I must tell you once more that, in accordance with the fundamental, sacred cosmic law of Heptaparaparshinokh, if any formation, large or small, existing in our Megalocosmos fails to receive, in the process of its evolution, corresponding help from outside at the time of its passing through both mdnel-ins of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh, it begins to involve back to the state from which it began its evolution. "It is the same, of course, for the definite cosmic substances formed in the presences of these terrestrial abstaining monks. "And so, my boy, since these terrestrial monks, particularly the contemporary ones, do not intentionally help the further evolution of this substance inevitably formed in them from the constant use of the first beingfood—that is, they do not actualize being-partkdolgduty in their common presences, intentionally or even automatically—and since at the



same time they do not remove this substance from themselves in the normal way intended by Nature, it begins to involve in them And during this involution of 'being-exioëhary' or 'sperm,' among the many transient substances formed in their common presences by this involutionary process, a definite substance is elaborated with the property of exerting two kinds of action on the general functioning of the planetary body of a being. "The first kind of action of this definite substance consists in promoting the deposit of superfluous 'karatsiag' or, as they call it there, 'fat ' And the second promotes the arising and spreading in the whole planetary body of what are called 'poisoninoskirian vibrations.' "In the first case, these terrestrial abstaining monks become so extraordinarily fat that indeed one sometimes meets specimens among them with such an abundant deposit of fat that they could give many points to that form of being your favorites expressly overfeed in order to increase this fat in their planetary bodies, and this form of being they call 'pig.' "In the second case, on the contrary, these abstaining monks become, as is usually said there, 'thin as a rail', and the penetrating action of the 'poisoninoskirian vibrations' is evident chiefly in their general psyche, which becomes sharply dual, with manifestations of two diametrically opposite kinds—the outer and visible, for show, sensed by everyone around them, and the inner and hidden, which the ordinary beings there, especially the contemporary ones, are entirely incapable of perceiving or detecting In other words, in their outer, visible manifestations, these 'poisoninoskirian monks' appear to be what your favorites would describe as 'bigots of the highest degree,' and in their secret inner manifestations, hidden from others, what your favorites would call 'expert cynics,' also of the highest rank.
"As for why the involutionary process of the exioëhary



among certain of the abstaining monks produces 'poisoninoskirian vibrations'
instead of deposits of fat, there even exists a very detailed 'theory,' worked out
several centuries ago by a certain what is called 'Catholic monk,' who proved
conclusively that this happens because in the first years of their existence
these 'thin monks' busy themselves very zealously with that occupation from
which, as is known even to contemporary medicine, 'pimples' generally
appear on the faces of young beings there.
"So that you may represent to yourself and fully understand the
significance of this sort of abstinence among these contemporary monks, it
remains for me to add that during my last sojourn on the planet Earth I
became convinced that, thanks only to the results of the involutionary process
of the exioëhary in these unfortunate terrestrial abstaining monks, the
crystallization of various consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer in their common presence has become greatly facilitated and has
therefore increased.
At this point in his narrative, Beelzebub was interrupted by a ship's servant
who handed him a 'leitoochanbros ' He put it to his ear and began to listen to
the contents.'



THIRD BOOK



CHAPTER 40
Beelzebub tells how men learned and again
forgot about the fundamental cosmic law of
Heptaparaparshinokh
AFTER BEELZEBUB had listened to the contents of the "leitoochanbros" handed to him, his grandson Hassein again turned to him and said: "Dear and kind Grandfather! Please help me clear up one contradiction which I do not understand and which does not accord with my logical confrontations. "When you began your elucidations concerning the Holy Planet Purgatory, you enjoined me to try to take in everything you told me, without missing anything, and you also enjoined me to maintain without ceasing the intensity of my 'active mentation,' so that corresponding data for a clear representation of all the details of both fundamental sacred cosmic laws should be completely crystallized in me I did indeed try during all your elucidations to do so and, it seems to me, I cleared up so much for myself about these cosmic laws that perhaps I could even freely explain them to someone else. "In any case, I can already represent to myself very well the sacred law of Triamazikamno with the particularities of all three of its independent sacred forces, and have cognized it for my own essence quite satisfactorily, and in regard to the sacred law of Heptaparaparshinokh, although certain of its details, unimportant in my opinion, are still not entirely clear to my Reason, I hope that with a little more active pondering I shall understand them as well. "However, while trying to assimilate these sacred laws thoroughly, I clearly sensed that they are very complicated and that it is difficult to have a 'complete' understanding of



them And suddenly a question arose in me which continues to perplex and
interest me how is it possible that the three-brained beings who arise and exist
on the planet Earth could understand these sacred cosmic laws, or could even
discern them among the surrounding cosmic results? From all your tales about
these beings, I got the full impression that ever since the second transapalnian
perturbation there, each of them, by the time he reaches responsible age,
thanks to the prevailing abnormal 'oskiano,' possesses only 'automatic Reason.'
"And when I myself tried to understand these two sacred cosmic laws, I
became convinced with the whole of my essence that it would be impossible
to do so with that Reason alone.
Having said this, Hassein looked inquiringly and eagerly at his beloved
grandfather.
Beelzebub, after thinking a moment, began to speak as follows:
"All right, my dear boy, I shall try to throw some light on this natural
perplexity which understandably arises within you.
"It seems to me that I already told you that ever since the period you
mentioned, almost all the three-brained beings on that planet, thanks to the
abnormally established conditions of ordinary being-existence, have had only
an 'automatic Reason', nevertheless it does sometimes happen that certain of
them chance to escape this common fate and, instead of that usual 'automatic
Reason,' 'genuine Objective Being-Reason' is formed in them as it is in all
three-centered beings of our Great Megalocosmos.
"Such exceptions, especially during recent centuries, are very rare there,
yet, I repeat, they do occur.
"In order that you may approximately represent to yourself and understand
how these exceptions occur, you must above all remember that, although after
the consequences



of the properties of the organ kundabuffer had begun to be crystallized in them their Reason became quite automatic, nevertheless the presence of each one of them has always contained, from their arising and the beginning of their formation, the germ of all the possibilities for the crystallization, during their further formation into responsible beings, of corresponding being-data which could later serve for the engendering and functioning of Objective Reason—that Reason which should be in the common presence of threebrained beings of all natures and all external forms, and is none other than the 'representative of the Very Essence of Divinity. ' "Their greatest misfortune in the objective sense, which you yourself 'instinctively suspect,' as I discern from the way you asked this question, especially from your allusion to 'oskiano,' is that, in spite of having such possibilities in themselves at their arising, they are subjected from the very first days after separation from their mother's womb— thanks to the abnormalities established in the process of ordinary being-existence of the beings of responsible age around them—to the stubborn influence of that maleficent means they have invented for their own use, namely, that sort of 'oskiano' I have already told you about, called 'education.' "In consequence, the possibilities for the free development of all that is required for engendering Objective Being-Reason are gradually atrophied in these unfortunate, utterly blameless, newly arisen beings, and finally disappear during the period of their 'preparatory age ' And later, when these young beings reach 'responsible age,' they acquire in the 'center of gravity of their essence,' instead of the Objective Reason they ought to have, merely a strange conglomeration of automatically perceived artificial and even deceptive impressions which, though having nothing in common with the localizations of their spiritualized being-parts, neverthe



less makes a connection with the separate functionings of their common
presence As a result, not only does the whole process of their existence flow
automatically, but almost the entire process of the functioning of their
planetary body becomes dependent only on accidental, external impressions,
also perceived automatically.
"In very rare cases certain of these favorites of yours, on reaching
responsible age, possess genuine pure Reason, proper to responsible three
brained beings .
"This usually comes about in the following way: "For instance, one of these newly arisen beings, immediately after
separation from his mother's womb, finds himself in the course of his further
formation in surrounding conditions in which all those abnormalities that fill
to overflowing the entire process of external being-existence of the three
brained beings breeding on this ill-fated planet do not touch him or have any
maleficent influence over him And thus the germ within him of the possibility
of acquiring pure Reason does not have time during the process of his further
formation to atrophy to the very root.
"Furthermore, it also sometimes happens that in these relatively normal
conditions such a young three-brained being, during the period of his
preparation for responsible existence, finds as a responsible guide a three
brained being who, also of course by chance, was completely formed in the
same way, and in the functioning of whose waking consciousness there
already participate, thanks to the frequent fulfillment in his presence of being
partkdolgduty, the data which have remained whole in his subconscious for
engendering the divine impulse of Conscience.
"And so this same guide, who is aware with the whole of his being of the
importance and significance of the responsibility taken upon himself in
relation to the new being who has only just reached preparatory age in the
aforementioned conditions, begins, impartially and according to Con



science, to create for his 'oskiano' every kind of inner and outer factor for
perceiving corresponding impressions, in order to crystallize in his common
presence all those data which alone, in their totality, can give to the three
brained being when he reaches responsible age the 'power' to be
'svolibroonolnian' or, as your favorites would say, the 'power not to be
identified with and not to be affected by externals through one's inevitably
inherent passions ' And it is solely this being-impulse, engendered in the being
by these data, that can help him to attain a free and impartial observation of all
true phenomena appearing in the cosmic results around him.
"Here it is appropriate to remark that on most planets of our Megalocosmos
where three-brained beings arise and exist, there is an oft-repeated saying,
formulated in the following words:
" 'Our Common Father Endlessness is only the Creator of a three-centered
being But the genuine creator of his essence during the period of his
preparatory existence is his "oskianotsner" '—that is, he whom your favorites
on the planet Earth call 'educator' or 'teacher. '
"And so it sometimes happens, even during the last few centuries, that one
of your favorites who has reached responsible age, having been completely
formed and prepared for external perceptions in the way I described, discovers
by chance a certain law-conformable particularity in the cosmic results around
him and begins to study it in detail and from every aspect, and having
ultimately, after long persevering labors, attained to some objective truth, he
initiates similar beings around him into this truth.
"Now, my boy, listen while I tell you how these peculiar three-brained
beings first became aware of the fundamental cosmic law of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, and how the totality of information concerning this
knowledge possessed by certain beings of ancient times was actualized in all
its



details from generation to generation, thus becoming the inheritance of every
subsequent three-brained being of this planet of yours, and listen also to what
the strangeness of their psyche has made out of all this.
"I wish to explain to you in as great detail as possible, in historical
sequence, not only how your favorites became aware of this sacred law, but
also how they gradually forgot about it, because this information will greatly
help you to elucidate those 'unimportant details,' as you called them, which
you have not yet completely transubstantiated in your Reason Furthermore,
you will learn from this that even in our day, among your contemporary
favorites, genuinely learned responsible beings do occasionally appear whose
impartial and modest conscious efforts could generate the arising and gradual
development of genuine Objective Science even on this ill-fated planet
assuming that the other three-brained beings there were to exist more or less
normally— and as a result that welfare might also be obtained for them which
has long since been merited and enjoyed by the three-brained beings of all
other planets of our Great Megalocosmos.
"In the beginning, during the period when the three-brained beings of that
planet still had in themselves the organ kundabuffer, it was of course out of
the question that they could have learned about any cosmic truths.
"But later, when this maleficent organ had been removed from their
presence, and when in consequence their psyche became free and, so to speak,
'individual' and their own— it was just then that all the trouble arose with their
'relatively sane being-mentation. '
"The first time that these three-brained beings who have taken your fancy
perceived and cognized with their whole presence the fundamental cosmic law
of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh was on the continent of Atlantis when cer



tain beings—do you remember, I have already told you— understood by themselves that something 'not quite right' proceeded in them, and when they also discovered that they had certain possibilities of destroying this something 'not quite right' and of becoming such as they ought to be. "It was just at that period of the flow of time when certain of them had observed those 'abnormal functionings' proceeding in their common presence—abnormal, that is, according to sane being-mentation—and were seeking out their causes, and trying to find every possible means of removing them from themselves, that many branches of genuine science reached a very high degree of development Among those who were seriously interested in this 'most essential activity of Reason,' as it was then called, was a terrestrial three-brained being by the name of Theophany, who was the first to lay a rational foundation for the subsequent development of this branch of genuine science. "As I chanced to learn later, this Theophany was once pouring a certain mixture onto a marble slab to dry, which consisted of the extract of the plant then called 'patetook,' pine resin, and cream from the milk of the then famous 'Khenionan goats,' so that when hardened it would produce a mastic used for chewing after eating, when he noticed for the first time that in whatever way and in whatever quantity this mixture was poured onto the marble slab, it always solidified in the same way—and after the final cooling always assumed a form composed of seven distinct plane surfaces. "This fact, unexpectedly ascertained by Theophany, greatly astonished him and an intense wish arose in his common presence to elucidate to his Reason the root causes, still unknown to him, of this law-conformable phenomenon, and he therefore began to repeat the same procedure, but now with a conscious aim.
"From the very beginning of the investigations under



taken by Theophany, his friends—other learned beings with whom he shared
the findings of his experiments—also became interested and participated in
his further research.
"Well then, after long and detailed investigations, this group of learned
three-brained beings of your planet recognized for the first time and became
categorically convinced that almost all the cosmic results manifested around
them, perceived by the organs of beings in some or other definite form,
always have in the course of their external transitory states seven independent
aspects.
"As the result of the conscious labors of these few learned three-brained
beings, a branch of almost normal science arose and began to develop on the
continent of Atlantis under the name of 'tazaloorinono,' which meant the
'science of the seven aspects of every whole phenomenon.
"But when that continent perished, no trace of this branch of genuine
science survived, and again for many long centuries the beings of that planet
knew nothing about this sacred cosmic law.
"This branch of science on the continent of Atlantis was evidently so
widely known that the learned beings there saw no need to include anything
about it in a legomonism, as, you may remember, they usually did for all
those ideas, the knowledge of which they wished to transmit unchanged to
beings of future generations.
"If a legomonism concerning this branch of science had existed, something
of this knowledge would certainly have been preserved, as was the case with
other knowledge attained by the beings of Atlantis, through those who were
by chance saved after the loss of that continent.
"The knowledge concerning the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh became
known again only after many, many of their centuries, thanks to two great
terrestrial learned beings, the brothers Choon-Kil-Tess and Choon-Tro-Pel,
who later be



came saints and who are now on the Holy Planet Purgatory where we have just been. "Do you remember, I already told you that on the continent of Asia, in the
country of Maralpleicie there was a king named Koniutsion, a descendant of
the learned member of the Society of Akhldanns who had gone there from At
lantis for the observation of all kinds of natural phenomena of their planet,
and that this same king had invented for his subjects the 'ingenious tale' I told
you about in order to save them from the pernicious habit of chewing the
seeds of the flower called 'gulgulian.'
"Well then, the grandson of this King Koniutsion, after the arising of an
heir who in his turn became king over the beings of this group, had two
results of the male sex, twins, the first of whom was named Choon-Kil-Tess
and the second Choon-Tro-Pel In the country of Maralpleicie the word 'choon'
meant 'prince. '
"These two brothers, direct descendants of one of the chief members of the
great learned society, happened on the one hand to meet with corresponding
conditions during their 'preparatory age,' and on the other hand they
themselves tried their utmost to prevent the atrophy of the hereditary
faculty—present in them as in all newly arisen three-brained beings of this
planet—of crystallizing data for engendering in themselves the power to
actualize being-partkdolgduty And moreover, since the 'affirming source' of
the causes of their arising or, as is said, their 'father,' had decided to direct
their responsible existence into the field of learning and took all
corresponding measures to prepare them for this, they became, from the very
beginning of their responsible age, almost like the three-brained beings
everywhere on the planets of our Great Megalocosmos who choose the same
aim, that is, those who pursue scientific research not for the satisfaction of
their weaknesses called 'vanity,' 'pride,' and



'self-love'—as is done, particularly in contemporary times, by the beings there who choose this same field for themselves—but for the attainment of a higher level of being. "At the outset they became, as is said there, 'learned specialists in the field
of medicine,' and afterward, learned in general.
"The period of their preparatory age and the early years of their responsible existence were spent in the city of Gob, in the country of Maralpleicie, but when this part of the surface of your planet began to be buried beneath the sands, they both joined those refugees who went east. "This group of three-brained beings fleeing from the country of
Maralpleicie, among whom were these twin brothers, the future great learned
beings, crossed the eastern heights of Maralpleicie and settled on the shores of
a large water space.
"They later formed a settled group inhabiting a country which still exists today and which is known as 'China. ' "Well then, in this new place of their permanent existence called 'China,' these same two brothers were the first, after the loss of the continent of Atlantis, to ascertain and cognize the fundamental cosmic law of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh. "It is a most interesting and curious circumstance that the initial source of
this discovery of theirs was the totality of cosmic substances localized in that
same surplanetary formation called there 'papaveroon,' or 'poppy ' As I have
already said, it was owing to the pernicious habit of chewing the seeds of this
poppy that their great-grandfather, King Koniutsion, first invented for his
subjects his famous 'religious teaching. '
"Evidently these two great terrestrial learned beings had inherited from their ancestor, King Koniutsion, in addition to the ability to recognize and understand their being-duty



toward their fellow beings, a passionate interest in the study of this product, which has always been one of the innumerable harmful factors for bringing the psyche of your favorites, already enfeebled without this, to its ultimate degeneracy. "In order that you may better represent to yourself and understand just why this small surplanetary formation I mentioned, named 'papaveroon' or 'poppy,' enabled these exceptional terrestrial learned beings to rediscover that most great cosmic law, you must know first of all that on all planets, among all kinds of surplanetary and intraplanetary formations in general, and particularly among formations called 'flora,' there arise, for the purposes of the transformation of common-cosmic substances during the process of Iraniranumange, three classes of crystallizations. "The crystallizations belonging to the first class are called 'oonastralnian arisings', those belonging to the second class, 'okhtastralnian arisings', and those belonging to the third class, 'polormedekhtic arisings.' "Through the 'oonastralnian arisings'' there are transformed in the course of
evolutionary or involutionary processes those cosmic crystallizations, or
!active elements,' which are derived only from substances transformed by that
planet itself on which this kind of surplanetary or intraplanetary formation
exists for the purposes of the common-cosmic Iraniranumange.
"Through the 'okhtastralnian arisings' there are transformed, besides the
cosmic crystallizations I have mentioned, also those 'active elements' which
are derived from the substances transformed by the sun itself and by the other
planets of the given solar system.
"And through the arisings of the third class, namely the 'polormedekhtic,' there are transformed, besides the cosmic crystallizations of the first two classes, all those 'active ele



ments' corning from the transformation of substances of various cosmic concentrations belonging to other 'solar systems' of our common Megalocosmos. "The surplanetary formation known on your planet by the name of 'poppy' belongs to the class of polormedekhtic arisings, and through it there evolves or involves the totality of results of the transformation of all other 'cosmic centerof-gravity concentrations' penetrating the atmosphere of this planet of yours through the common-cosmic process of what is called the 'universal diffusion of the radiations of all kinds of cosmic concentrations.
"And so, my boy, after these two great terrestrial learned beings, Choon-Kil
Tess and Choon-Tro-Pel, were more or less settled in their new place of
permanent existence in that still quite young China, they resumed the
intentional fulfillment—interrupted through no fault of theirs—of being
partkdolgduty in the professional field chosen for their responsible existence,
namely, scientific research in the branch called 'medicine. '
"They then undertook a study of the totality of cosmic substances which your favorites had long since learned to extract from that polormedekhtic plant and had named 'opium,' a word denoting in the language of the beings of that group, 'dream-maker. ' "These two great brothers began to investigate this opium because they, as well as many other three-brained beings of that time, noticed that on introducing a certain preparation of this substance into themselves, every painful sensation temporarily disappeared. "First of all, they set out to study the action of all its properties in the hope of finding one property by means of which to eradicate or at least bring under control the special form of 'psychic illness' which was then very widespread among the refugees around them.



"In the course of their research, they first noticed that this opium consisted of seven independent crystallizations with specific subjective properties. "And on further and more detailed investigations they established clearly that each of the seven independent crystallizations of this 'one whole' consisted in its turn of seven other specific crystallizations, also with their independent subjective properties, and these in their turn, again of seven, and so on almost to infinity. "This astonished and interested them so greatly that they put aside all the tasks they had set themselves, and from then on devoted themselves with perseverance exclusively to the investigation of this amazing fact which they had been the first to observe, and ultimately they attained results without precedent, even at the period of the existence of the continent of Atlantis, and unequaled at any later epoch among the three-brained beings of your planet. "Well, many centuries after the planetary existence of these great terrestrial learned beings, now saints, Choon-Kil-Tess and Choon-Tro-Pel, when I happened, for one of my investigations, to become acquainted with the detailed history of their activities, I learned that, after they had been convinced beyond doubt that this totality of cosmic substances called 'opium' consists of a whole range of compounds of seven active elements with different subjective properties, they began, with the same aim, to investigate many other cosmic results or, as is said there, 'phenomena' occurring in their environment. "Later, however, they confined their investigations only to three, namely to
'opium,' to what is called the 'white ray,' and to 'sound. '
"While studying those three diversely manifested 'results of cosmic processes,' they became categorically convinced that although these three results in respect of their origin and outer manifestations have nothing in common, their



inner structure and functioning are exactly alike down to the smallest detail.
"In short, for the second time on your planet, and long after the loss of the
continent of Atlantis, these twin brothers verified and categorically
demonstrated again that every separate and outwardly independent
phenomenon—if each is taken as a unit—consists in the totality of its
manifestations of seven secondary independent units, each with its own
subjective properties, that these secondary independent units in their turn
consist of seven tertiary units, and so on almost to infinity, and that in each of
these primary, secondary, and tertiary units, and so on, the processes of
reciprocal relation and reciprocal influence take place in the same way, with
rigorous exactitude, down to the smallest detail, and with similar
consequences.
"By the way, my boy, in the course of their investigations, they
differentiated and defined for the first time the seven independent aspects of
each whole phenomenon, as well as its secondary and tertiary derivatives.
"They named the first seven fundamental aspects of each whole:
1 erti-pikan-on 2 ori-pikan-on 3 sami-pikan-on 4 okhti-pikan-on 5 khooti-pikan-on 6 epsi-pikan-on 7 shvidi-pikan-on
"And the second-order aspects:
1 erti-noora-chaka 2 ori-noora-chaka 3 sami-noora-chakoo



4 okhti-noora-chaka 5 khooti-noora-chaka 6 epsi-noora-chaka 7 shvidi-noora-chakoo
"And in order to indicate which of the three results of cosmic processes each of these names referred to, they added after each one the following: "For indicating the nuances of sound, after noting the number of their
vibrations, they always added to the name the word 'alil. '
"For indicating the particularities of the composition of the 'white ray,' they added the expression 'nar-khra-noora.' "And for indicating the active elements of the polormedekhtic product
called 'opium' they simply added the number denoting their 'specific gravity. '
"And to define specific vibration and specific gravity, these great
terrestrial learned beings took as the standard unit the vibration of sound
which they were the first to call the 'nirioonossian world sound. '
"I will explain to you a little later the meaning of the expression
'nirioonossian world sound' first used by these two great learned beings of the
Earth, but meanwhile, for your clearer understanding of my future
explanations of this subject, you must also know that everywhere, on all
planets, genuine scientists take as the standard unit for their confrontative
calculations of specific gravity and specific vibration the smallest particle, as
established by Objective Science, of the most holy Theomertmalogos that still
contains the 'fullness of vivifyingness' of all three holy forces of the sacred
Triamazikamno But on your planet, genuine scientists, as well as those of
new formation of all periods, have always taken as a standard unit what is
called the 'atom of hydrogen' for the same purpose, that is, for their 'con
frontative calculations' of all the specific parts, with diverse



properties, of any given whole—for instance, for establishing the 'specific gravity' of various active elements which had become known to them among all those that ought to be present in the spheres where they exist—considering this 'atom of hydrogen' for some unknown reason to be the smallest possible unit and moreover indivisible. "It must be pointed out that these 'sorry scientists' among your favorites do not even suspect that if this 'atom of hydrogen' of theirs is indeed the smallest unit, and indivisible in all the spheres of their planet, this does not mean that it cannot be broken up many more times within the limits of other solar systems or even in the spheres of certain other planets of their own solar system. "In this connection you should know that this same 'hydrogen' is one of those seven cosmic substances which taken all together actualize for the given solar system what is called the 'inner ansapalnian octave' of cosmic substances, and that this independent octave, in its turn, is one of the seven independent parts of the 'fundamental common-cosmic ansapalnian octave ' "There is also an 'inner independent ansapalnian octave' present in the solar system to which our dear Karatas belongs, and we call its seven heterogeneous cosmic substances of different properties:
1 planokurab—which is their hydrogen 2 alillonofarab 3 krilnomolnifarab 4 talkoprafarab 5 khritofalmonofarab 6 sirioonorifarab 7 klananoizufarab
"And on your planet, the genuine learned beings have given different names at different periods to these same seven 'rel



atively independent' crystallizations of different properties or, according to
their expression, 'active elements,' which compose the 'inner ansapalnian
octave' of their own solar system, however, the contemporary 'learned
chemists' there, who are already 'learned beings of new formation of the first
water,' call them:
1 hydrogen 2 fluorine 3 chlorine 4 bromine 5 iodine
"They have no names at all for the last two definite crystallizations because
these names did not reach them from their ancestors, and at the present time
they do not even suspect the existence on their planet of these two cosmic
substances, which are, nevertheless, the principal factors indispensable for
their own existence.
"These last two cosmic substances, which remain quite perceptible and
accessible in all spheres of their planet, were still known only about two
centuries ago to beings who were then called 'alchemists,' but whom
contemporary 'comic scientists' call simply 'charlatan occultists,' considering
them to be merely 'exploiters of human naïveté ' And these substances were
called by the alchemists 'hydro-oomiak' and 'piotrkarniak. '
"And so, my boy, these great terrestrial learned beings, the twin brothers Choon-Kil-Tess and Choon-Tro-Pel, now saints, were the first, after the loss of Atlantis, to lay anew the foundation of this knowledge They not only laid anew the foundation of this 'totality of special information' but they were also the first on Earth to ascertain two of the three



fundamental particularities of that great law about which I have told you, that
is to say, they were the first to ascertain its two 'mdnel-in.s ' That branch of
genuine knowledge, similar to the one known on the continent of Atlantis as
the 'science of the seven aspects of every whole phenomenon,' they called the
'Law of Ninefoldness', and they called it thus because they added to the seven
clearly differentiated manifestations of this great law, which they called
'doostzakos,' the two particularities first observed by them which they named
'sooansotoorabitzo,' a word signifying 'obligatory gap aspect of the unbroken
flowing of the whole ' And they named this law thus because during their
exhaustive research they became convinced beyond doubt that in all the
'cosmic transitory results' they investigated, these particularities are
necessarily found at specific places in the process of this great law.
"These two great Chinese learned beings had recourse for their
investigations to every kind of chemical, physical, and mechanical
experiment, and they gradually developed a very complicated and highly
instructive experimental apparatus, which they called 'alla-attapan. '
"By means of this apparatus, 'alla-attapan,' they clearly proved to
themselves and to others that these three 'transitory results' of cosmic
processes, namely, the 'polormedekhtic' product called 'opium,' the 'white ray,'
and 'sound,' have in their very essence a common property, in other words,
these three outwardly quite different cosmic phenomena have exactly the
same 'structure of actualization,' that is, they have in themselves exactly the
same reciprocally acting 'law-conformableness' for their manifestation, so that
all three of these outwardly different and apparently independent transitory
results have exactly the same action on each other as they have within
themselves This means that the 'doostzako' of any one result acts on the
corresponding 'doostzako' of another result exactly in the same way as it



functions in that specific 'doostzako' which is one of the seven aspects of this
other whole cosmic result.
"This apparatus, with which these great brothers made their elucidatory
experiments, I saw with my own eyes many centuries after the period when
they existed there, and I became very well acquainted with its construction.
"As my personal knowledge of the details of the construction and action of
this remarkable experimental apparatus, alla-attapan, was due to accidental
circumstances connected with my essence-friend Gornahoor Harharkh, and as
it will surely be very interesting for you and at the same time exceedingly
instructive, I shall describe it to you in some detail.
"My exhaustive study of this astonishing apparatus, alla-attapan, which
thanks to Gornahoor Harharkh became famous among the genuine scientists
of almost our whole Megalocosmos, came about as a result of the following
chance circumstances.
"During one of my sojourns on the planet Saturn, my essence-friend
Gornahoor Harharkh, who had somehow heard about these experiments,
asked me in the course of conversation to bring him one of these apparatuses
from the planet Earth if I happened to be there again.
"And on a later occasion when I visited the surface of this planet of yours,
I procured one of these apparatuses and took it back with me to the planet
Mars in order to send it at the first opportunity to Gornahoor Harharkh on the
planet Saturn.
"As it turned out that our ship Occasion did not go to the planet Saturn for
a long time, this apparatus, alla-attapan, remained in my house on the planet
Mars and often came within the field of the automatic perception of my
organs of sight, and during periods of rest from active mentation I examined it
attentively, and ultimately became familiar with all the details of its
construction and action.



"This famous experimental apparatus, alla-attapan, consisted of three independent parts. "The front part was called 'loosochepana,' the middle part 'dzendvokh,' and the last, the rear part, was called 'riank-pokhotartz. ' "Each of these three parts in its turn consisted of several special and separate adaptations. "The front part, named 'loosochepana,' consisted of a special cone-shaped pipe, the wide end of which was hermetically fitted into the frame of the only window of the room where the experiments were made and the other end of which had a small slit with a 'collecting disk,' through which the 'rays of daylight' coming from the window were transformed, as your favorites would say, into a 'concentrated white ray.' "This 'concentrated white ray,' passing then through a crystal of special form, was broken up into seven 'rays of different colors,' which fell upon a small slab made of ivory called 'pirindjiel.' "This slab, 'pirindjiel,' was so constructed and regulated that the colored rays falling on it were again concentrated, but this time in a different way, and passing through a second crystal, also of a special form, fell on another, but larger, ivory slab called 'polorishboorda.' "Opposite this 'polorishboorda' was a small apparatus of special
construction through which, on its being shifted in a certain way, any colored
ray which fell on the 'polorishboorda' could be isolated and directed further on
to the third part of the alla-attapan called 'riank-pokhotartz. '
"Here, by the way, you might as well be told that the knowledge relating to the construction of the first crystal of this part of the alla-attapan also reached your contemporary favorites, and they call this crystal a 'prism. ' "With this prism the contemporary terrestrial scientists also obtain seven colored rays from the white ray and they



fancy that by this means they can learn about certain other cosmic phenomena. "But, of course, these fancies of theirs and all other forms of their
'scientific titillation' come to nothing, because through this 'prism' of theirs
they obtain only what are called 'negative colored rays' from the white ray,
whereas, in order to understand any other cosmic phenomena connected with
the transitory changes of the white ray, they must necessarily have its
'positive colored rays.'
"Your contemporary favorites, however, imagine that the colored rays
they get with this child's toy they call a 'prism' are the same 'positive rays'
which the great scientists obtained, and in their naïveté they think that the
'spectrum,' as they call it, derived from the white ray gives the same order of
appearance of the rays as that in which they issue from their source.
"In short, as regards these sorry scientists of new formation, one can only
utter the expression often used by your favorites themselves 'To hell with
them. '
"It is not for nothing that certain of our Sacred Individuals have no other
word for your contemporary favorites than 'freaks.'
"And so, with the aid of these two crystals, those great learned beings
obtained from the white ray its positive colored rays and then, by means of
the slab, 'polorishboorda,' which was a part of the 'loosochepana,' any one of
these colored rays was directed onto the third and principal demonstrating
part of this astonishing apparatus, namely, the 'nank-pokhotartz. '
"This principal part consisted of an ordinary tripod, on the top of which two balls, also of ivory, were fitted one upon the other in a certain way, the upper ball being much larger than the lower one.
"In the lower, smaller ball, directly opposite the part of



the loosochepana through which the 'positive colored rays' had already
passed, was a cavity of a special form in which was placed either the whole
polormedekhtic product named 'opium,' or one of its active elements, required
for the experiment.
"The upper ball was bored right through on its diameter, horizontally, at
right angles to the loosochepana, and another, smaller bore was drilled in this
same ball, radially perpendicular to the larger bore, but reaching only to the
center and directly opposite the loosochepana.
"This second bore, drilled halfway through, was made in such a way that
the colored rays could be projected as desired either directly from the
loosochepana or reflected from the cavity of the lower, smaller ball.
"Through the open bore in the larger ball, there could be freely moved
what is called a 'bamboo cane,' previously prepared in a special manner.
"A long time before the experiment, numbers of these bamboo canes were
soaked together in conditions of absolute darkness, or in 'orange light,' as is
said there on the Earth, obtained from burning 'simkalash,' which was
obtained from a certain kind of 'clay' usually deposited in the soil of your
planet near accumulations of 'salounilovian' acids, which in their turn are
formed from 'masmolin' or, as your favorites call it, 'naphtha. '
"These bamboo canes were soaked in a liquid consisting of:
1 The whites of eggs from the bird called 'amersa-marskanara',
2 The juice of the plant called 'chiltoonakh', 3 The excretion of a quadruped being bearing the name of 'kezmaral',
4 A specially prepared amalgam of mercury



"When these bamboo canes had been thoroughly soaked, they were inserted
one by one into thicker bamboo canes not prepared in this manner, the ends of
which were hermetically sealed.
"These latter preparations were of course also made in absolute darkness, or in the orange light of 'simkalash. ' "Later, when one of these soaked bamboo canes was required for an
experiment, one end of the thicker, unsoaked cane was inserted in a special
way into the bore which was drilled right through the large ball of the 'riank
pokhotartz,' and was opened by a small hook fixed to a thin rod, by means of
which the soaked cane could be moved at any desired speed.
"Now the action of the liquid I have described was such that the part of the
soaked bamboo cane on which a colored ray fell, whether coming directly
from the loosochepana or after having been reflected from the cavity of the
lower smaller ball, was instantly and permanently dyed the same color as the
ray that had fallen on it.
"The exposed parts of the soaked bamboo canes were also dyed the colors
corresponding to the 'vibrations of sound' which reached them, and which
were produced by the strings attached to the middle part of the apparatus
called 'dzendvokh. '
"This 'dzendvokh' consisted of a very strong frame of a special form made
from the tusks of 'mammoths,' on which were stretched many strings of
various lengths and thicknesses, some made from 'twisted goat-gut,' and some
from the tail hairs of beings of various exterior forms.
"Tell me please, dear Grandfather, what is a 'mammoth'?" asked Hassein
"A mammoth," replied Beelzebub, "is a two-brained being, formerly, it
also bred on your planet and it had, in comparison with other beings there of
all brain systems, a large exterior form.



"Beings of this kind also became victims of the consequences of the
breaking-off from the planet Earth of that large fragment called 'Moon,' which
is now an independent, as I expressed it, 'planetary upstart' of this solar
system Ors, and the chief bearer of evil to this ill-fated planet of yours.
"When the atmosphere of this small planetary upstart began to be formed
and became gradually harmonized, great winds arose in the atmosphere of the
planet Earth, owing to which several regions of its surface—you remember, I
have already told you about this—were buried under sands, what is more,
snow fell incessantly in the regions around what are called the 'North' and
'South' poles, covering up all the depressions of the land surface of those
'polar regions.'
"The beings called 'mammoths' used to breed on these parts of the land
surface of your planet, and during the unprecedented 'snow storms,' they were
all buried by snow, and since then this species of beings has never reappeared
there.
"It is interesting to note that in these depressions that were formerly
covered with snow, and later with 'kashiman,' that is, with substances forming
what is called 'soil' on the surface of your planet, well-preserved planetary
bodies of these mammoths are still occasionally found today.
"These planetary bodies of mammoths have been preserved so well and for
such a long time because the snows were covered very soon after with
'kashiman,' which brought about the condition of 'isoliasokhlanness' or, as
your favorites would say, the condition of a 'hermetically closed sphere,' in
which the planetary bodies of these mammoths have never been 'exposed to
decomposition,' as is said there—in other words, the 'active elements' of
which these planetary bodies are composed have not completely involved
back to their 'prime origin.'



"And so, my boy, this astonishing apparatus, alla-attapan, demonstrated that
all three 'transitory results' of cosmic processes I have just been speaking of
not only are alike in their inner manifestations, but are also made up of the
same factors.
"By means of this apparatus it was possible to verify and demonstrate that
in each of the three transitory results of common-cosmic processes having
outwardly nothing in common, exactly the same reciprocal actions take place,
ensuing each from the other to constitute one common functioning, and that as
regards the evolutionary and involutionary properties of the Law of
Heptaparaparshinokh, the action at any separate intermediate stage in the total
functioning of one of these results influences the action at each separate
intermediate stage in another, exactly as in its own functioning, and
furthermore that with respect to the properties of the vibrations of which they
are constituted, these transitory cosmic results have complete affinity.
"This complete affinity in the inner reciprocal relations of these three
transitory results which have outwardly nothing in common was proved in the
following way:
"For example, a colored ray directed upon an active element of opium
transformed it into another active element corresponding in its newly acquired
vibrations to those of the colored ray which had acted upon it.
"And if, instead of the colored ray, corresponding vibrations of sound from
the strings of the dzendvokh were directed upon this same active element, the
same result was obtained.
"Further, if any colored ray was made to pass through any active element of
opium, then, in passing through it, this same ray took on another color,
namely, that color whose vibrations corresponded to those of this active ele
ment, or if any colored ray was made to pass through the



'wave of sound vibrations' still resounding at that moment from any
corresponding string of the dzendvokh, then, in passing through this wave, it
took on another color, corresponding to the vibrations produced by the given
string.
"Or finally, if a specific colored ray and specific sound vibrations were
simultaneously directed upon any active element of opium from among those
having a lower number of vibrations than the sum of the vibrations of the
colored ray and of the sound, then this active element of opium was
transformed into another, the number of whose vibrations corresponded
exactly to the sum of the two differently caused vibrations, and so on and so
forth.
"This incomparable experimental apparatus likewise demonstrated that the
higher vibrations of one result always give the direction to the lower
vibrations of other 'transitory cosmic results.'
"After all you have just been told, my boy, you can now be given that
information thanks to which there might be crystallized in your mentation
data for understanding what sort of results proceeded from the tenacious and
impartial conscious labors of these saintly twin brothers, the great terrestrial
scientists, and also for understanding the extent to which the being-Reason in
the presence of your unfortunate favorites has progressively deteriorated.
"And so, for the second time in the course of my observations of the
existence of these three-brained beings who have taken your fancy, there
arose in this still quite young China, thanks to the twin brothers, those great
terrestrial scientists, an independent branch of genuine science, that is, the
'sum of the information concerning a special question' thoroughly cognized by
the perfected Reason of three-brained beings of earlier epochs, in the given
case, concerning the fundamental cosmic law of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, then called the 'Law of Ninefoldness.' And during the
first two or three centuries after the sacred



rascooarno of the great twin brothers, this branch of science was not only
handed down almost normally in an unchanged form from generation to
generation, but it was gradually worked out in greater detail thanks to their
followers, also genuine learned beings, and became accessible to the per
ception of even ordinary beings.
"And this happened chiefly because they maintained the practice,
established by the learned beings of the continent of Atlantis, of handing
down such information to beings of subsequent generations only through
genuine initiates.
"Here, my boy, I cannot fail to remark and declare with conviction that
indeed, if this long-established practice had been maintained, even
automatically, in the process of existence of these unfortunate three-brained
beings who have taken your fancy, this sum of true information, already thor
oughly assimilated by the Reason of their still 'relatively normal' ancestors,
might have remained intact and might have become the inheritance of your
contemporary favorites, and moreover, those of them who constantly strive
not to become complete victims of the consequences of the organ
kundabuffer, accursed for them, might have taken advantage of this
information with the aim of easing their now almost impossible inner struggle.
"But to the regret of all more or less conscious, relatively independent
Individuals of our Great Megalocosmos and to the misfortune of all the three
brained beings arising on this ill-fated planet of yours, after two or three of
their centuries that blessing created for them by their great ancestors, thanks to
their conscious labor and intentional suffering, gradually began to be distorted
and was ultimately almost totally destroyed.
"This followed from two causes. "The first was that, owing to the same abnormal conditions of external being-existence they themselves established, certain of them became responsible beings with that



special 'psycho-organic need' which in their speech might be formulated thus: 'An irresistible thirst to be considered learned by beings around them
like themselves.
"And this psycho-organic need began to engender in them that strange tendency I have spoken about many times, which they call 'cunning wiseacring. ' "By the way, my boy, bear in mind once and for all that whenever I use the
expression 'learned beings of new formation' I refer to those of your favorites
who are afflicted with this special inherency.
"The other cause was that owing to certain external circumstances of that
period not depending on them, but ensuing from common-cosmic processes,
chiefly from the action of the law of Solioonensius, the being-data
crystallized in them for engendering the impulses of 'sensitivity' and
'foresight' weakened in the common presence of the genuine initiated beings,
and they began to accept into their midst these types of 'new formation' and to
initiate them into certain true information the totality of which was known to
them alone From that time on, this branch of genuine knowledge, becoming
the possession of so many, began gradually to be distorted and once again
was almost entirely forgotten.
"I used the word 'almost,' because after this period, when a relatively
normal process of being-existence had been re-established, certain fragments
of the totality of this objectively important and true information again began
to be handed down exclusively through genuine initiates and, passing down
unchanged from one generation to another, reached even your contemporary
favorites, though only a very limited number of them.
"Most of your contemporary favorites, however, received from all this true knowledge, attained and thoroughly cognized by their great and remote ancestors, only a few prac



tical fragments of little importance that had reached them automatically, and which in the troubled period I mentioned were very widespread among the ordinary beings of this still quite young China. "Among these unimportant fragments that automatically reached most of
your contemporary favorites are, first, several methods of extracting from the
polormedekhtic product named 'opium' certain of its independent active
elements, second, what is called the 'law of combination of colors', and third,
the 'seven-toned scale of sound. '
"As regards the first of the three fragments relating to the practical results
attained by the Reason of three-brained beings of ancient China, I must tell
you that since certain of the components of this product called 'opium' have
special properties exerting an agreeable action on the abnormal common
psyche of beings, it came into constant use, and therefore the knowledge of
many methods of extracting certain of its independent active elements began
to be transmitted from generation to generation and reached your
contemporary favorites.
"At the present time they extract many of its specific elements and use them avidly for the satisfaction of always the same consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, crystallized in them. "These elements, extracted by them from the general composition of this polormedekhtic product have other names, of course, among your contemporary favorites. "One of their 'comic learned chemists,' a certain Mendeleyev, has even
collected the names of all those active elements now available and so to say
'classified' them according to their 'atomic weights.'
"Although his classification does not correspond at all to reality, it is possible, according to these 'atomic weights' of his, to approximate the classification established by those great terrestrial learned beings of China.

"Of the nearly four hundred active elements of opium that became known
to the great brothers, the contemporary chemists of the Earth know how to
obtain only forty-two, which now have the following names:
1 morphine 2 protopine 3 lanthopine 4 porphyroine opium or narcotine 6 paramorphine or thebaine 7 phormine or pseudomorphine 8 metamorphine 9 gnoscopine oleopine 11 atropine 12 pirotine 13 rheadine 14 tiktoutine kolotine 16 xanthaline 17 zoutine 18 tritopine 19 laudanine laudanosine 21 podotorine 22 arkhatosine 23 tokitosine 24 liktonosine meconidine 26 papaverine 27 cryptonine 28 kadminine 29 kolomonine koilononine



31 cotarmine 32 hydrocotarmine 33 opianine or meconine 34 meconoiozine 35 listotorine 36 phyktonosine 37 codeine 38 narceine 39 pseudocodeine 40 microparaine 41 rnicrothebaine 42 messaine
"The last time I was on your planet I heard that the contemporary learned
beings of the community of Germany had, as it were, discovered methods of
extracting several other independent active elements from opium.
"But as I had already been convinced that the contemporary 'scientists' of
that community for the most part only indulge in fantasy and, like the beings
of ancient Greece, prepare nothing good or beneficial for future generations, I
took no interest in these 'scientific attainments' as they call them, and do not
know the names of these new active elements of the present day.
"As regards the second of the three fragments relating to the practical
results attained by the Reason of those beings of ancient China which has
reached contemporary beings, namely, the knowledge relating to the 'law of
the combination of colors,' this information was transmitted almost
continuously from generation to generation, but year by year it was
progressively distorted, until barely two centuries ago it was finally forgotten.
"At the present time some information relating to this law is still passed down, but it is known only to certain three-brained beings of the community named 'Persia', moreover,



now that the influence of the famous 'modern European painting' is
automatically spreading more and more widely throughout this community,
one must of course expect, as our esteemed teacher would say, the speedy and
total 'evaporation' of this information.
"As regards the 'seven-toned scale of sound' that reached your
contemporary favorites from the ancient Chinese beings, I must tell you about
this in as much detail as possible, first of all because this information will
help you understand the laws of vibrations in which all the details of the
sacred Heptaparaparshinokh can be observed and recognized, and also
because I brought home with me, among other objects intentionally
manufactured by your favorites for use in their ordinary daily existence, a
'sound-producing instrument' called a 'piano,' on which the 'strings' that gen
erate vibrations are arranged and can be tuned in the same way as on the
'dzendvokh,' that is, the second principal part of the famous experimental
apparatus, alla-attapan, created by the great twin brothers.
"When we return to our dear Karatas, I can demonstrate to you on this
piano what is called the 'order of succession of the processes of reciprocal
blending of vibrations,' and thanks to my practical explanations you will be
able more easily to represent to yourself and approximately understand just
how and in what order the process of the Most Great Trogoautoegocrat takes
place in our Great Megalocosmos, and in what way both large and small
cosmic concentrations arise.
"While telling you how this third fragment relating to the 'practical results'
of the ancient true knowledge survived and automatically reached your
contemporary favorites, I will start by explaining more precisely this same
law of vibrations, which was first formulated by the great brothers as the 'law
of the seven centers of gravity of the vibrations of sound.



"I have already said that at the beginning, while that totality of true
information or fragment of genuine knowledge was being handed down from
the beings of one generation to another through genuine initiates alone, not
only did the exact meaning put into it remain unchanged in its entirety but,
thanks to other genuine learned beings among their followers, it began to be
worked out in greater detail, and even became accessible to the perception of
ordinary three-brained terrestrial beings.
"Among these followers, about a century and a half after the sacred
rascooarno of the saintly brothers, was a certain genuine learned being by the
name of King-Too-Toz who, on the basis of the principles of construction of
the middle part of the apparatus alla-attapan, named 'dzendvokh,' propounded
a very detailed theory called the 'theory of the evolution and involution of
vibrations', and to confirm this theory of his he made a special experimental
apparatus which he named 'lav-mertz-nokh' and which later, by the way, also
became known to almost all the learned beings of our Great Megalocosmos.
"This apparatus, 'lav-mertz-nokh,' like the middle part of the alla-attapan,
consisted of a very strong frame on which a great many strings were stretched,
made from the tail hairs and gut of various quadruped beings there.
"One end of each string was attached to one edge of this frame, and the
other to a peg inserted into the opposite edge.
"These pegs were inserted in such a way that they could be freely turned in
their peg holes,' and the strings attached to them could be tightened or
loosened at will to obtain the required number of vibrations.
"Of the many strings stretched on the lav-mertz-nokh, forty-nine were
colored white, and the totality of vibrations,' that is to say, the specific sound
produced by the oscillations of each one of them, was called a 'center of



gravity of the octave.' This specific sound corresponded to what your
favorites now call a 'whole tone.'
"Each set of seven strings producing 'center-of-gravity sounds,' or 'whole
tones,' was then called an 'octave,' as it still is today.
"So in this way there were stretched on the apparatus, lav-mertz-nokh,
seven octaves of 'whole tones,' the totality of the general consonance of which
gave what is called the sacred 'hanziano'—just what the two great brothers
had surmised, and which proved to coincide almost exactly with what, as I
already said, they had named the 'nirioonossian world sound. '
"Each of these octaves of strings on the lav-mertz-nokh gave that totality
of vibrations which, according to the calculations of the great twin brothers,
corresponded to the totality of vibrations of all the cosmic substances issuing
from seven separate independent sources, substances that constitute one of the
seven centers of gravity of the fundamental 'common-cosmic ansapalnian
octave. '
"Each white string on the lav-mertz-nokh was tuned separately by this
Chinese learned being, King-Too-Toz, in such a way that it gave the average
number of vibrations which, according to the calculations of the great
brothers, ought to be present in the substances constituting one of the seven
centers of gravity of the given totality of substances, which in its turn
constitutes one of the seven centers of gravity of the fundamental cosmic
octave of substances.
"On the lav-mertz-nokh, each octave, as well as each whole tone of the
octave, had its own name.
"Thus, the highest octave of the strings was called 'arachiaplmish,'
The second highest, ‘erkrordiapan.’ The third
highest, 'erordiapan.' The fourth highest,
'tchorordiapan.'



The fifth highest, 'piandjiapan.' The sixth highest,
'vetserordiapan.' The seventh highest, 'okhterordiapan'
"And the 'center-of-gravity strings' which were colored white had the same
names in all octaves, with the addition of the name of the given octave.
"These whole tones were called thus:
The first, the highest in the octave, 'adashtanas' The second highest, 'evotanas' The third highest, 'govorktanas' The fourth highest, 'maikitanas' The fifth highest, 'midotanas' The sixth highest, 'loukotanas' The seventh highest, 'sonitanas'
"The contemporary beings of the earth now call these same whole tones
'do,' 'si,' 'la,' 'sol,' 'fa,' 'mi,' 're. '
"By the way, my boy, in order that the greatness of these two saintly
brothers may be still more evident to you, I draw your attention to the fact
that the calculations they made to establish what is called the 'quality of the
vivifyingness of the vibrations' of sound, which according to their
suppositions corresponded with the vivifyingness of the cosmic sources of
substances, was found to coincide almost exactly with reality.
"Their merit was all the greater because they, as terrestrial beings, had no
true information about this and were able to make these correct suppositions
and almost exact calculations of many objective cosmic truths exclusively
thanks to their own conscious labor and intentional suffering.
"Well, my boy, this learned being, King-Too-Toz, strung in certain places
on the lav-mertz-nokh, in each octave, in between these white strings or
whole tones, five other



strings, but this time colored black He named these black strings 'demisakhsakhsa,' which corresponded to what the beings of the Earth call 'half tones. ' "On the lav-mertz-nokh none of these 'half-tone strings' were stretched in the spaces between those whole-tone strings where—according to the indications of the saints Choon-Kil-Tess and Choon-Tro-Pel, and in conformity with the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh—there is no possibility of the independent evolution and involution of the vibrations of sound, spaces they were the first to call 'gaps ' And in the places of the octave where these 'gaps' were, between the whole tones, this learned being, King-Too-Toz, stretched special strings made of the tail hairs of a being called 'horse. ' "These hair strings produced vibrations which were not always the same,
and King-Too-Toz called them 'chaotic vibrations.'
"The number of vibrations obtained from these hair strings did not depend on their tension, as in the case of the other strings, but on other causes, chiefly on three conditions ensuing from surrounding cosmic results, namely the action of the vibrations produced around them by other strings of the lavmertz-nokh, what is called the 'temperature of the atmosphere' at the given moment, and the radiations of the beings nearby, of whatever brain system. "On this lav-mertz-nokh between the white, black, and hair strings in each
octave, fourteen strings made of twisted gut were also stretched, which were
colored red and called 'kiskestchoor', and if contemporary beings of the Earth
were to use these strings they would call them 'quarter tones.'
"Further, all these 'quarter-tone' strings on either side of the hair strings
were attached in such a way that by tightening or loosening them the
vibrations issuing from them could at any moment be changed as desired, and
these vi



brations could be regulated and blended by ear with the 'chaotic vibrations' obtained from the hair strings. "And this was so arranged because thanks to the frequently changing
vibrations of the hair strings—the quality of which depended, as I already
said, on the temperature of the atmosphere, on the radiations of the beings
nearby, and on many other causes—the vibrations of these red strings
acquired the property, when they did not blend with the vibrations of the hair
strings, of acting on beings nearby very 'cacophonously' and 'injuriously,' even
to the extent of their total destruction.
"By frequently varying the tension of the red strings, however, and by
blending their vibrations with those issuing from the lav-mertz-nokh, they
were rendered harmless, that is, by this means the totality of vibrations issuing
from the lav-mertz-nokh was made to flow 'harmoniously' for the beings who
heard them, and ceased to have a harmful action.
"And so, my boy, this apparatus lav-mertz-nokh, and also the detailed theory
of this conscientious learned being of long ago named King-Too-Toz, suffered
the same fate as the incomparable apparatus alla-attapan and the whole sum of
true information cognized by the great brothers.
"Owing to the continuous and ever-increasing formation among your
favorites of the new type of learned being I mentioned, with the same
inherency for 'cunning wiseacring,' this whole branch of knowledge was
altered and its genuine sense and significance gradually forgotten.
"But now I will tell you how the basic principle of the arrangement of the
strings of the apparatus lav-mertz-nokh, and also that middle part of the alla
attapan called the 'dzendvokh,' automatically reached your contemporary
favorites.
"When the acute phase of that 'confused period' I mentioned had passed, certain of the surviving fragments from



all those great attainments of Reason of the still 'relatively normal' three
brained beings of your planet again began to be transmitted to subsequent
generations in the manner long since established in the process of their
ordinary existence, that is, only through beings worthy of becoming initiates
and of acquiring the corresponding knowledge However, each year more and
more responsible beings were formed with the inherency I mentioned, and it
was then that there arose in this same China a three-brained being by the
name of Chai-Yoo, who on reaching responsible age also became a scientist
of new formation Thanks to this Chai-Yoo the knowledge and practical
application of the seven-toned scale of sound became generally accessible
and, passing from generation to generation, automatically reached your
contemporary favorites.
"In the early years of his responsible existence this Chai-Yoo was selected,
on account of certain of his corresponding subjective merits, as a candidate
for what is called 'first degree initiate' and, in consequence, as had long before
become the custom, help was given him without his knowledge by genuine
initiated beings, who were designated to enable him to obtain every kind of
information relating to various true events that had taken place on their planet
in the past.
"And as my latest thorough investigations made clear to me, he became
worthy to be informed, among other things, about the great apparatus lav
mertz-nokh, in all the details of its construction.
"And then, simply for the sake of being regarded as a 'scientist' by beings
around him, this Chai-Yoo, who was one of the first 'ideal specimens of a
scientist of new formation' there, that is, a being with a 'fully developed in
herency to wiseacre,' not only wiseacred a new theory of his own on the basis
of the information he had learned in the said manner about the details of the
great apparatus



lav-mertz-nokh—a theory 'affirming and denying' absolutely nothing relating
to the laws of vibration—but he also constructed a new simplified sound
producing instrument named 'king.'
"His simplification consisted in this, that without taking into account the
red and the hair strings on the lav-mertz-nokh, he made the basis of his sound
producing instrument only the white and black strings, retaining moreover
only the number of strings corresponding to two octaves, and he placed them
in such a way that one whole octave was in the middle and had for its
evolutionary and involutionary continuation half of the next higher octave and
half of the preceding lower octave.
"Although the theory 'wiseacred' by this Chai-Yoo also did not last very
long, the sound-producing instrument, 'king,' that he had constructed became
generally accessible to the ordinary three-brained beings there owing to its
simplicity, and since the results obtained from it by an intentional action
turned out to be very good and satisfactory for 'tickling' many data
crystallized in their common presence, thanks to the consequences of the
properties of the organ kundabuffer, this instrument began to pass automat
ically from generation to generation.
"The outer form of this sound-producing instrument, the construction of its
frame, the tension of the strings, and their names were changed many times
by the beings of subsequent generations, ultimately taking the form among
your contemporary favorites of those cumbersome sound-producing
instruments, complicated to the point of idiocy and reduced in power to a
childish level, such as the 'clavicymbalum,' 'clavichord,' 'organ,' 'grand piano,'
'upright piano,' 'harmonium,' and so on Nevertheless, the basic principle of
what is called 'alternation of center-of-gravity sounds' is still the same today
as when it was actualized by the saintly



brothers Choon-Kil-Tess and Choon-Tro-Pel on the 'dzendvokh,' that is to say,
the middle part of the incomparable experimental apparatus alla-attapan,
which they created.
"That is why, my boy, this 'Chinese seven-toned subdivision of the octave
of sound,' simplified by Chai-Yoo, which has reached your contemporary
favorites and is now used for all the sound-producing instruments I have just
enumerated, may still serve, as I have said, for a 'practical confrontative study'
and an approximate understanding of how cosmic substances of different
density and vivifyingness are formed during the process of the Most Great
Trogoautoegocrat from what is called the 'flow of vibrations issuing one from
another,' and how they unite and separate among themselves to form large and
small relatively independent concentrations, thus actualizing the common
cosmic Iraniranumange.
"Moreover, you will soon be convinced of this yourself when we return to
our dear Karatas and I demonstrate and explain to you, as I already promised,
the significance of the principle of tuning that contemporary sound-producing
instrument, the 'piano'—which, among a number of other things, I brought
home with me from the surface of your planet in order to clarify
experimentally, at leisure, one of its particularities that I had no time to study
on the spot, and which is connected both with the strange psyche of these
three-brained beings who have taken your fancy and with the vibrations of
different vivifyingness engendered around them.
"Now, as regards the strange psyche of your favorites, I wish to tell you
about one fact I observed during my last sojourn among them, namely, that
although the contemporary three-brained beings of your planet have made this
'Chinese seven-toned subdivision' the basis of all their sound-producing
instruments and perceive its consequences almost daily, they are not at all
inspired by this—as objec



tively they should be—but on the contrary, under the action of this kind of
consonance, with a total lack of remorse and even with an impulse of
satisfaction, they intentionally maintain in themselves the flowing of those
associations that arise in their common presence in all their spiritualized parts
under the influence of data crystallized in them from the consequences of the
properties of that accursed organ kundabuffer.
"After that practical demonstration on the piano, you will have, I am sure,
not only an approximate representation of what is called the 'flow of center
of-gravity vibrations issuing one from the other and blending harmoniously,'
but you will realize once more with an impulse of astonishment the extent of
the weakening in the common presence of your favorites of the essential
action of the being-data which in general should be crystallized in the
presence of all three-brained beings, and which taken as a whole are called
'subtlety of instinct.'
"And so, my boy, thanks on the one hand to the inevitable deterioration in
the common presence of these three-brained beings who have taken your
fancy of the quality of functioning of all the data crystallized in them for a
sane being-mentation, and on the other hand to the ever-increasing number of
those among them who become responsible beings of a new type, that is to
say, 'learned beings of new formation,' the contemporary three-brained beings
inherited nothing of this whole body of detailed information— thoroughly
cognized by the Reason of former beings similar to them and almost
unprecedented in the Universe, and utilized today for the welfare of ordinary
three-brained beings on all the planets of our Great Megalocosmos with the
sole exception of that planet on which it arose—nothing, I say, but what our
always esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin expresses in the following words:
" 'Glory be to Thee, Lord Creator, for having made the



fangs of wolves not like the horns of my dear buffalo, for I can now make excellent combs for my dear wife. "And in the particular case of the 'Chinese seven-toned subdivision of the
octave' which has reached your contemporary favorites, although as I have
already said they use it widely in the process of their ordinary existence, they
have no inkling that it was specially created and constructed on those
unshakable principles on which everything existing in the whole of our Great
Megalocosmos is based.
"If one does not take into account that insignificant number of beings
belonging to certain small groups existing on the continent of Asia who have
instinctively sensed the hidden meaning of this 'Chinese division of a whole
sound into seven distinct centers of gravity,' and who limit its practical
application to being-manifestations they consider sacred, then one may boldly
say that, in the presence of almost all the three-brained beings who arose on
this planet of yours during recent centuries, data for becoming aware of the
elevation of sense and meaning put into this 'division' have entirely ceased to
be crystallized And even the contemporary three-brained beings breeding on
this same continent of Asia, as well as those existing on all the other terra
firma of the surface of your planet, who have lost all instinctive sensitivity
all of them, without exception, use it only for the satisfaction of certain of
their low purposes, unbecoming to three-brained beings.
"What is most interesting in the whole history I have just related about the
knowledge of the sacred Law of Heptaparaparshinokh acquired by the three
brained beings breeding on your planet is the following although collections
of special information of all sorts or, as they say, 'separate branches of
scientific knowledge,' have again appeared among them, with which as it
were they 'cram' themselves, the 'law of vibrations,' which is the most
important branch of all and gives the possibility of recognizing reality at least



approximately, is completely unknown to them, with the exception of course
of their celebrated 'theory of sound,' which arose comparatively recently and
is 'seriously' studied and supposedly known by contemporary 'learned
physicists' and 'learned musicians.'
"In order to give you a 'vivid picture' of the essence of your contemporary
favorites and lay bare the causes of various misunderstandings that arose in
the realm of this branch of knowledge, and that are widely spread among
certain of your favorites—misunderstandings that are very characteristic and
might serve you as excellent material for representing and evaluating the
sense and objective significance of all other separate branches of their
contemporary so-called 'exact science'—I consider it necessary to explain to
you in detail the theories of the 'vibrations of sound,' now studied and as it
were 'known,' by these terrestrial 'sorry scientists. '
"But before speaking about this, my essence once more enjoins the whole
of my common presence to express sincere compassion for the fate of those
contemporary terrestrial three-brained beings who, thanks to their persevering
being-partkdolgduty, finally attain that degree of Reason at which it becomes
indispensable for them to acquire in their presence genuine information
relating to the law of vibrations.
"I am reminded of this by association at the present moment with an
impulse of pity, because during the period of my last sojourn among them I
happened more than once to meet three-brained beings for whom it was
indispensable, on account of their state of, so to say, 'psychic perfecting,' to
absorb and transmute true knowledge concerning the law of vibrations, and at
the same time I understood clearly that there was no source from which they
could draw such knowledge.
"To be sure, they have at the present time a certain 'totality of information'
or, as they themselves name it, a 'theory of vibrations,' yet the unfortunate
contemporary beings who



are in need of knowledge cannot, in spite of all their wishes and efforts,
obtain from it anything in the least satisfactory for their search—unless
perhaps various misconceptions and contradictions.
"And so, my boy, the basis for these terrestrial misunderstandings was that
various fragments of information concerning the 'law of vibrations' reached
contemporary beings from two different sources, that is, from the ancient
Chinese and from the ancient Greeks, whose community—as you remember,
I already told you—was formed long ago between the continents of Asia and
Europe by those Asiatic fishermen who out of boredom, when the weather
was bad, invented various 'sciences,' including this 'science of the vibrations
of sound.'
"And later, this 'science' of theirs, also passing from generation to
generation, reached your contemporary favorites at almost the same time as
the Chinese science.
"All the subsequent misunderstandings stemmed from the fact that the
information which reached them from the ancient Chinese indicated that one
whole octave of vibrations contains 'seven restorials,' that is to say, that the
octave consists of seven center-of-gravity sounds, while the Greek
information stated that the whole octave of vibrations has five restorials, that
is, that the octave consists of five centers of gravity or five whole tones.
"And so, only because in the presence of your favorites in recent centuries
the functioning of all the data for 'being logical reflection' crystallized in them
proceeds almost, as is said, 'topsy-turvy,' and as this information that reached
them from two entirely different sources appeared to their bob-tailed logical
mentation equally plausible, those beings of contemporary civilization who
had begun to cook up like pancakes all kinds of 'scientific specialties' fell into
a state of great 'perplexity,' and for some years could not make up



their minds which of these two contradictory theories to adopt and include
among the branches of their 'official science.'
"Finally, after expending a great deal of 'saliva,' as they say—in order that
no one should take offense and at the same time so that this branch of their
science should include both of these theories from ancient times which had
nothing in common with each other—they decided to combine them into one.
And a little later, one of them named Gaidoropoolo thought out a very long
'mathematical' explanation of this misunderstanding, stating why one theory
speaks of the division of the octave into seven whole tones, and the other, into
only five whole tones, and why and how such an important contradiction had
occurred, and from then on, these mathematical explanations of his entirely
pacified all the qualified representatives of contemporary civilization, so that
now, with a quiet conscience, they build up all their 'wiseacrings' about
vibrations on the mathematical explanations of this obliging Gaidoropoolo.
"These mathematical explanations were based on the following
considerations:
"First this obliging Gaidoropoolo, in a certain way known only to himself,
calculated the number of vibrations of each of the Chinese 'seven whole tones'
and then explained that in the Chinese seven-toned octave those whole tones
called 'mi' and 'si' are not really whole tones at all but only half tones, since
the number of their vibrations is almost the same as the number of vibrations
of those Greek halftones which according to the division of the Greek octave
are found precisely between the Chinese whole tones 'mi' and 'fa' and 'si' and
'do.'
"Further, he put forward the hypothesis that it was probably convenient for
the Chinese to have the 'restorials' of the voice, or centers of gravity of the
voice, on these half



tones, and that for this reason they divided their octave not into five whole tones like the Greeks, but into seven, and so on and so forth. "After this explanation of Mr Gaidoropoolo, all the other contemporary
scientists of new formation, having stuck a label also on this branch of their
'official science,' were completely pacified.
"And now this branch called the 'theory of the law of vibrations' exists there, as our wise teacher Mullah Nasr Eddin would say, 'in clover ' "In this connection I remember and, willy-nilly, cannot help expressing aloud another wise saying of our always esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin, which goes as follows: 'Ekh . . . you, Koorfooristanian pantaloons, what difference does it make
if you have a mule or a hare for your farm work? Don't they both have four
legs?'
"Of course these contemporary favorites of yours do not know or even
suspect that these two divisions of the octave into whole tones, which they call
the 'Chinese' and the 'Greek,' have as the basis of their arising two entirely dif
ferent causes the first, that is, the Chinese division, was, as I have said, the
result of the thorough knowledge of the Law of Heptaparaparshinokh attained
by the great twin brothers, unequaled before or since on the Earth, and the
second, that is the Greek division, was based solely on what are called the
'restorials of the voice' which were natural to the voices of the Greek beings at
the period when this five-toned Greek octave was composed.
"Almost as many of these 'restorials of the voice' or, as they are sometimes
called, 'light sounds of the voice,' were and still are formed among your
favorites as there are independent groups into which they were and still
continue to be divided And this is so because these 'light sounds of the voice'
are in general formed in beings from many outer and inner surrounding
conditions, not depending upon



them—for instance, geographical, hereditary, and religious conditions and even the quality of nourishment and the 'quality of reciprocal influences,' and so on and so forth. "Your contemporary favorites, of course, cannot understand that however
hard these ancient Greeks tried, or so to say 'however conscientious their
attitude toward this matter,' they could not, with all their wish, find in the
division of the octave of sound into distinct tones either more or less than
these five whole tones, since the totality of all the inner and outer conditions
not depending on them gave them no other possibility, during their chanting,
than to rely on their five 'restorials of the voice. '
'Restorials,' or 'center-of-gravity sounds in the voices of beings,' are
those tones which, during the production of different sounds by their
corresponding organs—in accordance with properties fixed in them as a
result of hereditary and of acquired faculties, and depending on the general
functioning of their presence—the beings manifest freely, easily, and for a
long time, without evoking any tension whatever in their other separate
functionings In other words, 'restorials' are obtained when the tempo of the
result of this manifestation of theirs fully harmonizes with other functionings
of their common presence, whose tempo is already fixed in them thanks to all
the inner and outer conditions of their ordinary being-existence.
"Owing to the various conditions of local character, and also to various
hereditary qualities, different 'restorials,' or 'center-of-gravity sounds of the
voice,' are formed in beings of almost every group or geographical region,
and hence the division of the octave into whole tones among beings who
breed on different parts of the surface of the planet is quite different.
"At the present time there, groups exist among your favorites which have the capacity to produce the 'center-of-gravity sounds' of an octave of sound not only in five or



seven but even in as many as thirteen and seventeen whole tones.
"To illustrate what I have just said, the beings of a small group dwelling on
the continent of Asia will serve as a good example I personally very much
liked to listen to their singing, for among their physiological capacities
although they had the data for the manifestation of only three 'restorials'
they were able in their chanting to produce up to forty distinct sounds.
"Their chanting was extremely delightful yet, at the same time, however
exuberantly they might sing, the calm and sustained production of the
vibrations of sound were obtained only on one or another of their three
'organic restorials.'
"The physiological characteristic of the beings of this small group
consisted in this no matter what number of definite sounds they produced in
the whole octave of their voice, they constantly maintained the 'unchanging
totality of vibrations' obtained only on these three restorials, inherent in them,
and during this entire manifestation of theirs these restorials had the property
of evoking what is called 'centralization,' or 'echo,' in the whole presence of
another being.
"I made all this very clear to myself when, having become interested in
their singing, I began to investigate this characteristic, so rare among your
contemporary favorites, with the aid of three special 'tuning forks' I ordered,
and of several very sensitive 'vibrometers' I already possessed, which had
been invented for me personally by my essence-friend Gornahoor Harharkh.
"In the Chinese division of the octave into whole tones this being-property
was not taken into account at all.
"This Chinese subdivision of the octave into seven whole tones as well as
the information making up the totality of the special branch of knowledge
relating to the Law of



Ninefoldness were based on the results of the conscious labor and intentional
suffering of the great twin brothers, for which their highest bodies were
beatified and now dwell on that holy planet where we recently had the
happiness to be.
"However that may be, my boy, I regret very much that it will be
impossible for me by means of this contemporary sound-producing
instrument, the piano, which I brought back from the surface of your planet, to
give you a full explanation of the laws of vibrations from all sources which
actualize the common-cosmic Ansanbaluiazar, as could have been done so
ideally on the remarkable lav-mertz-nokh, created by the follower of the great
twin brothers, that no less great Chinese learned being, King-Too-Toz.
"On that remarkable experimental apparatus, lav-mertz-nokh, King-Too
Toz arranged and tuned, according to the corresponding calculations made by
the great brothers, exactly as many strings for engendering vibrations as there
are consecutive sources in the Universe—from any planet up to the
Protocosmos—in the presence of which the vibrations of cosmic substances,
changing according to law during the trogoautoegocratic process, blend in the
required manner for the actualization of everything further.
"Well, my boy, although the sound-producing instrument, the piano, which
I brought from the surface of your planet, is only a typical invention of your
contemporary favorites, yet—since the method of tuning the strings of its
'whole tones' and 'half tones' has not been changed—it might be possible, by
maintaining the order of blending of the vibrations produced in a
corresponding manner by its strings, to demonstrate experimentally the laws
of vibrations issuing from any one fundamental cosmic octave of substances,
that is to say, issuing from any one of the seven fundamental totalities of
sources Thanks to this, it might be possible to represent to oneself and to
understand how



all the vibrations issue from one another and act on one another, whatever
their source, because, as I have already told you, all the cosmoses of various
scales as well as each of the seven independent parts of the manifestations of
these cosmoses are in almost all respects similar to the Megalocosmos, and in
each of them the sevenfold sources of vibrations have the same reciprocal
actions as proceed in the Megalocosmos, and therefore, if you have
understood the laws of vibrations for any one center of gravity, it is possible
for you to have an approximate understanding of these laws for all centers of
gravity, if of course you take into account their difference of scale.
"I repeat, if the strings of this piano are tuned correctly, and the required
vibrations are evoked in the corresponding strings, the resulting blending of
vibrations coincides almost exactly, even mathematically, with the law
conformable totality of vibrations of the substances issuing from cor
responding cosmic sources, according to the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh.
"On this piano the vibrations of each 'whole tone' and of each 'half tone' of
any octave pass from one to another strictly according to the law of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh and thus their vibrations, as occurs always and every
where in the Universe, mutually help one another to evolve or involve.
"Here, by the way, it is interesting to note that if the calculations and
computations of these great terrestrial learned beings were almost exact, they
owed it to the fact that the standard unit they happened to take for their cal
culations was the same that is taken everywhere in the Megalocosmos,
namely, the smallest particle of the most sacred substance Theomertmalogos
that still contains all the power of vivifyingness proper to it.
"And now I will explain to you, as I promised, the 'nirioonossian world
sound' I mentioned



"The 'nirioonossian world sound' is just that sound whose vibrations your
favorites have taken for their sound-producing instruments since ancient
times—as a very limited number of them still do today, in this same China, of
course—as the 'absolute vibrations' of the tone 'do.'
"The existence of this sound came to be known on your planet in the following way: "It was first discovered by that learned member of the Society of
Akhldanns, founded on the continent of Atlantis, who was a progenitor of
those learned twin brothers and who, as you remember, chanced to meet the
first settlers of the country of Maralpleicie and was later chosen by them as
their chief.
"At that time, this learned member of the Society of Akhldanns, during his
observations of different cosmic phenomena proceeding on and beyond their
planet, noticed that in a certain part of this country, near the place where the
city of Gob later arose, twice a year, after certain meteorological
perturbations, the same definite sound was invariably heard and lasted for a
fairly long time.
"He then built on this spot an elevation that he needed, as they say there,
for the observation of 'heavenly bodies', and he constructed the elevation he
needed on this spot because he wished during these observations also to
observe and investigate this cosmic result, which at first was entirely
incomprehensible to him.
"And later, when the two great brothers, those future saints, began to
investigate the sacred cosmic Law of Heptaparaparshinokh, since they already
had knowledge of this cosmic result, they established themselves in the same
place, and there they succeeded in elucidating the character and nature of this
strange sound, which they made the unit of measurement of all their
calculations in general.
"On this piano, 'vibrations of extraneous origin' arise from different
'shocks,' 'noises,' 'rustlings,' and for the most



part from what are called 'aerial momentum vibrations,' which are generally formed in atmospheric space from the natural vibrations already present there. "It is necessary here in connection with the actualization of the fifth stopinder of the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh to trace a parallel between two processes which externally have nothing in common with each other Just as the first being-food cannot acquire its vivifying power until after its transformation into 'being-pentoëhary,' so on this piano, the vibrations of a string do not acquire a corresponding vivifying power until they have been fused with the preceding vibrations, starting from the totality of the center-ofgravity vibrations of the tone 'sol. ' "This last particularity of the sacred Law of Heptaparaparshinokh can be demonstrated with absolute certainty by this means, that is to say, on the piano, because if the vibrations of the tones 'mi' and 'si' are produced in a hermetically sealed room, they either instantaneously cease or, thanks to the momentum obtained from the shock which engendered their arising, they undergo involution, in short, the tone 'mi' returns to the tone 'do' and the tone 'si' to the lower 'fa. ' "In concluding the explanations I have given you relating to the division into seven tones of the octave of sound as it exists among your favorites, I must once again, alas, emphasize the fact that if any scraps of this knowledge have reached them, they have forgotten everything that was essential, and always for the same reason the disappearance from their presence of the practice of fulfilling being-partkdolgduty, a disappearance that is the very cause of the gradual deterioration in them of the mentation proper to threebrained beings. " At this place in his tales, Beelzebub became absorbed once again in his
own thoughts, and his gaze was fixed on the root of his grandson's nose.
There was rather a long silence, after which he continued:



"Ekh! My dear child, I must now willy-nilly tell you about some experiments relating to the laws of vibrations which I witnessed on that same planet Earth. "And I shall tell you about them in as much detail as possible for the two
following reasons:
"The first is that I have already said a great deal about this first
fundamental sacred Law of Heptaparaparshinokh, and I should therefore be
very distressed if for some reason or other you would not succeed in grasping
all its particularities And I am sure that my account of these experiments will
enable you to form for yourself a thorough representation of this law.
"And the second reason is that the terrestrial being who made these
experiments, thanks to the knowledge of cosmic vibrations he had acquired,
was the sole and unique being who, during the many centuries that I existed
upon the Earth, recognized and came to know my true nature. "



CHAPTER 41
The Bukharian dervish Hadji Asvatz Troov
"MY FIRST meeting with the contemporary terrestrial three-brained being with whom
I saw the experiments I mentioned will doubtless be extremely interesting and
instructive for you, especially because it is thanks to him, in all probability,
that information about the fundamental sacred cosmic Law of
Heptaparaparshinokh will again be established and become accessible to all
ordinary beings with a thirst for knowledge, even contemporary ones.
Therefore, I will tell you about this meeting in all its details.
"I met him for the first time three terrestrial years before my final
departure from that solar system.
"Once while traveling on the continent of Asia in the region called
'Bukhara,' I chanced to meet and become friendly with a certain three-brained
being belonging to the community inhabiting that part of the surface of your
planet, who was a member of a dervish brotherhood, and whose name was
Hadji Zephir Bogga Eddin.
"He was typical of those contemporary three-brained beings of the planet
Earth who have a tendency to 'enthuse' over 'higher matters,' as is said there,
and who, without an essential understanding of them, have become
automatized to speak about them, on opportune and inopportune occasions,
with anyone they meet And whenever we met, he liked to talk only about
such questions.
"One day we started talking about the ancient Chinese science known as
'shat-chai-mernis. '
"This science is nothing other than fragments of the sum of true
information concerning the sacred Heptaparaparshinokh cognized by the
great Chinese twin brothers and other



genuine scientists of ancient times, which they called the 'totality of true information about the Law of Ninefoldness. ' "I have already told you that certain fragments of this knowledge happened
to remain intact and passed from generation to generation through a very
limited number of initiated beings there.
"As a matter of fact, it will be a great stroke of luck for the future three
brained beings of your planet if these surviving fragments, which have passed
and are still passing from generation to generation through this very limited
number of initiated beings, do not fall into the hands of 'contemporary
scientists' there.
"And it will be a great stroke of luck because, if these surviving fragments
of genuine knowledge were to fall into the hands of contemporary scientists,
then, thanks to their inherency of wiseacring, they would without fail cook up
some sort of 'scientific porridge' out of the meaning put into them, and
thereby the barely smoldering Reason of all the other three-brained beings
would be entirely extinguished, moreover, these last remnants of the great
attainments of their ancestors would thus be completely wiped off the face of
that ill-fated planet.
"And so, my boy . . . "One day when I was talking with the dervish Hadji Zephir Bogga Eddin
about the ancient Chinese science of 'shat-chai-mernis,' he proposed, in the
course of conversation, that I should go with him to see another dervish, a
friend of his, who was a great authority on this ancient Chinese science, in
order to talk about it with him.
"He told me that his friend lived in 'Upper Bukhara,' far away from
everyone, and was occupied there with certain experiments relating to this
science.
"As I had no special business in the town where we happened to be, and as his friend resided in the very mountains



I had long wished to explore, I at once agreed and on the very next day we set
off.
"After leaving the town we walked for three days. "Finally, high up in the mountains of Upper Bukhara, we stopped in a
narrow gorge.
"This region is called 'Upper Bukhara' because it is very mountainous and
much higher than the rest of the country, called 'Lower Bukhara.'
"Here in this gorge my acquaintance, the dervish Hadji Zephir Bogga
Eddin, asked me to help him move a stone slab to one side, and when we had
moved it a small opening was disclosed, from the edges of which two iron
bars projected.
"He held these bars together and listened attentively. "Soon a strange sound was heard coming from them, and to my
astonishment, Hadji Zephir Bogga Eddin said something into the opening in a
language unknown to me.
"When he finished speaking, we moved the stone slab back into place and
went on.
"After having covered a considerable distance we stopped in front of a
rock, and Hadji Zephir Bogga Eddin again waited very tensely for something,
when suddenly the enormous stone that lay there slid aside, revealing the
entrance to a cave.
"We entered this cave and as we moved forward I noticed that our way
was lit up alternately by what are called 'gas' and 'electricity. '
"Although this lighting astonished me and I had a number of questions
about it, I decided not to disturb the serious attentiveness of my companion.
"When we had walked a considerable distance, we saw at one of the
turnings another terrestrial three-brained being coming to meet us, who
welcomed us with the greetings customary there and led us further.



"This was the friend of my dervish acquaintance Hadji Zephir Bogga Eddin. "He was quite old, from the point of view of your favorites, and in comparison with those around him he seemed very tall and extremely thin.
"His name was Hadji Asvatz Troov. "As he talked with us, he led us to a small chamber in the cave, where we all sat down on the felt that covered the floor and, continuing our conversation, began to eat what is called cold 'Bukharian shila pilaff' which this elderly being brought in an earthenware vessel from a neighboring chamber. "While we were eating, my dervish acquaintance told him, among other
things, that I too was very interested in the science of 'shat-chai-mernis,' and
then explained briefly what I already knew about it and what in general we
had discussed before.
"After that, the dervish Hadji Asvatz Troov began to question me himself and I gave him appropriate answers, but of course in the form already habitual to me, behind which I could always hide my real nature. "In fact, during my sojourns on your planet I became so skillful at talking in this manner that your favorites always looked on me as one of their fellow scientists. "From the conversation that followed, I learned that this venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov had been interested in this science for a long time, and that during the last ten years he had been studying it exclusively in its practical aspect. "I also realized that in this study he had reached results scarcely attainable by contemporary terrestrial three-brained beings. "When I had ascertained all this, I was greatly astonished and wished very much to know how it had come about, because I was well aware that such knowledge had long ago



ceased to exist in the Reason of the three-brained beings of the Earth, and so
this venerable hadji could not have heard about it often and thereby, as is
usual among them, have had an interest gradually awakened in him.
"And indeed, my boy, it has long since become proper to the three-brained
beings who have taken your fancy to become interested only in what they
often see or hear about And whenever they do become interested in
something, this interest stifles all their other being-needs, and it always seems
to them that what interests them at the moment is the 'very thing that makes
the world go round. '
"When the necessary relationship had been established between this
likeable dervish, Hadji Asvatz Troov, and myself, that is to say, when he had
begun to talk with me more or less normally, without the 'mask' which it has
become fully proper to your contemporary favorites to wear in front of other
beings like themselves—especially when they meet them for the first time—I
asked him, of course in the approved manner, why and how he had become
interested in this branch of true knowledge.
"In this connection I should tell you here that in general on the surface of
your planet, in the process of the ordinary being-existence of these strange
three-brained beings inhabiting each separate region, their own special forms
of external relationship with one another have gradually been established and
have passed from generation to generation.
"And these various forms of relationship among them came about of
themselves after the final atrophy in their psyche of the being-property of
sensing the inner feeling of other similar beings toward oneself—the property
which infallibly ought to exist in all beings of our Great Universe without
distinction of form or place of arising.
"At the present time on your planet, good or bad mutual relationships are
formed solely according to artificial outer manifestations, especially
according to 'amiability,' that is,



empty words without an atom of what is called the 'result of an inner benevolent impulse,' such as generally arises in the presence of all beings on meeting others like themselves. "Nowadays, however much one being may inwardly wish another well, if
for some reason he were to express himself to the other in words
conventionally regarded as not 'good form,' then all is over between them: in
all the separate, spiritualized localizations of the one to whom he spoke, data
are invariably crystallized which by association engender in him the
conviction that he who in fact inwardly wishes him well exists only to do him
every possible kind of villainy.
"So, particularly in recent times, it has become indispensable there to know
all the different forms of verbal address, if one wishes to have friends and not
make enemies for oneself.
"The abnormal existence of these strange three-brained beings has not only spoiled their own psyche but, by repercussion, has also gradually spoiled the psyche of almost all the terrestrial one-brained and two-brained beings. "The data giving rise to the inner being-impulse I mentioned are no longer
formed in the presences of those terrestrial one-brained or two-brained beings
with which your favorites have long had and still have frequent contact and
relations.
"It is true that these being-data still arise in the presences of certain
terrestrial one-brained and two-brained beings of different exterior forms, for
example, those they call 'tigers,' 'lions,' 'bears,' 'hyenas,' 'snakes,' 'phalanges,'
'scorpions,' and so on, whose mode of existence has never brought them into
contact with these biped favorites of yours. Yet, owing to the abnormally
established conditions of the ordinary existence of your favorites, one strange
and highly interesting feature has already been formed in the common
presences of the beings I mentioned, which is, that these tigers, lions,



bears, hyenas, snakes, phalanges, scorpions, and so on take the inner feeling
of fear in other beings confronting them as enmity toward themselves, and
therefore strive to destroy these others in order to avert this 'menace. '
"And this is because those three-brained beings who have taken your
fancy, thanks always to the same abnormal conditions of existence, have
gradually become, as they themselves say, 'cowardly from head to foot,' while
at the same time the need to destroy the existence of beings of other forms has
been inculcated in them, also 'from head to foot ' And so, when your favorites,
who are already arrant cowards, are about to destroy the existence of beings of
other forms, or when they unexpectedly meet these beings— which to their
misfortune and to our regret have now become much stronger than they, both
physically and in other being-attainments—they get in such a panic that, as
they say, they 'wet their pants.'
"Nevertheless, having the inherent need in their presences to destroy the
existence of these beings of other forms breeding on their planet, at such
moments they contrive with their whole being to find the means to accomplish
this.
"And as a result, from the radiations of these favorites of yours, there are
gradually formed in the common presences of these beings of other forms,
instead of the data that should exist in them for engendering the impulse of
'instinctively showing respect and sympathy' to every form of being, other
data with a special functioning, thanks to which the feeling of cowardice
appearing in the presences of your favorites is taken as a 'threat' to themselves
"That is why whenever these terrestrial one-brained and two-brained
beings meet your favorites, they always strive to destroy them in order to
escape the danger to their own existence.
"In the beginning, all beings on your planet, in spite of the differences in their exterior form and brain system, ex



isted together in peace and concord Even today it occasionally happens that one of your favorites perfects himself to the point of sensing with all his spiritualized parts that every being or, as is said, every 'breathing creature,' is equally near and dear to our Common Father Creator, and thanks to his fulfillment of being-partkdolgduty, he attains the complete destruction in his presence of the data for engendering the impulse of cowardice before beings of other forms, so that they not only make no attempt to destroy the existence of this perfected being, but even show him every kind of respect and render him service, as to a being with greater objective possibilities. "In short, all the foregoing, and a multitude of other minor factors, also resulting from the abnormal existence of these favorites of yours, have finally brought about the establishment of various forms of 'verbal amiability' for their mutual relationships and, as I have already told you, each locality has its own special form.
"The attitude of that kindly terrestrial three-brained being, Hadji Asvatz Troov, was all the more benevolent toward me because I was the friend of a good friend of his. "It must be remarked here, by the way, that the three-brained beings on this part of the surface of your planet are the only ones among whom the relationship of true friendship still exists. "Among them, as among three-brained beings everywhere else in the Universe and on that entire planet in its earliest epochs, not only is a friend himself a friend, but his near relatives and friends are also regarded as friends and are treated just the same as the friend himself. "I wished to make my relationship with Hadji Asvatz Troov still better because I very much wanted to know how he had become interested in that science, and how he had attained scientific accomplishments unsurpassed on the



Earth, and therefore, throughout our conversation, I made liberal use of the
forms of verbal amiability that were customary in that locality.
"In the course of our conversation, which dealt exclusively with the science
called at that time 'shat-chai-mernis,' while speaking of the nature and
significance of vibrations in general, we came to mention the octave of sound
Hadji Asvatz Troov said that not only did the octave of sound have seven
aspects of relatively independent whole manifestations, but that the vibrations
of any one of these relatively independent totalities, in the manner of their
arising as well as in their manifestation, obeyed the same law.
"And still on the subject of the laws of the vibrations of sound, he went on
to say:
" 'I myself became interested in the science of "shat-chai-mernis" through
studying the laws of the vibrations of sound, and they were the cause of my
devoting the rest of my life to this science.
"He thought a moment, and then related the following: " 'I should first tell you, my friends, that although I was a very rich man
before I entered the brotherhood of the dervishes, I was very fond of working
at a certain craft, that is, I used to make various stringed instruments of the
kind called "saz," "tar," "kamanja," and others.
" 'Even after I entered the brotherhood I devoted all my free time to this
craft, making musical instruments chiefly for our dervishes.
'And the reason why I became so seriously interested in the laws of vibrations was this: " 'Once the sheikh of our monastery called me to him and said:
"Hadji! In the monastery where I was still an ordinary dervish, during
certain mysteries, whenever our dervish musicians played the melodies of the
sacred canticles, all of us dervishes on hearing these melodies experienced
particular



sensations corresponding to the text itself of the canticle. " ' "But here, during my long and careful observations, I have never yet noticed any particular effect on our brother dervishes from these same sacred canticles. " ' "What is wrong? Why is this so? To discover the cause of this has recently become my aim, and I have now called you to speak with you about it. Perhaps you, as an amateur specialist in making musical instruments, can help me clear up this question that interests me. " 'Thereupon we began to inquire into this question from every aspect and after long deliberations we finally concluded that the whole cause probably lay in the very nature of the vibrations of the sounds. 'And we came to this conclusion because it came to light during our
inquiry that in the monastery where our sheikh had been an ordinary dervish,
they played, aside from the tambour, various stringed instruments, whereas
here in our monastery these same sacred melodies were played exclusively on
wind instruments.
" 'So we decided to replace without delay all the wind instruments in our monastery with stringed instruments, but then another serious problem arose, for we saw that it would be impossible to gather enough specialists from among our dervishes to play the stringed instruments
" 'Then our sheikh, after thinking for a while, said to me: "Hadji, you who are a specialist in stringed instruments, try—and
perhaps you can manage to make a stringed instrument on which any dervish,
without being a specialist, can produce the sounds of the desired melody by a
simple mechanical action, such as turning, striking, pressing, or something of
that sort. "
" 'This proposal of our sheikh at once interested me very much and I undertook the task with great pleasure. " 'Having made this decision I got up, received his blessing, and went to
my quarters.



'I sat down and thought very seriously for a long time, and the result of
my reflections was that I decided to make a "dulcimer" and to devise, with
the help of a friend, the dervish Kerbalai Azis Nooaran, a mechanism of small
hammers, which in striking would produce the required sounds.
" 'That same evening I went to see this friend of mine, the dervish
Kerbalai Azis Nooaran.
" 'Although this friend of mine was regarded by his comrades and
acquaintances as rather a queer fellow, they all respected and esteemed him,
for he was very intelligent and learned, and often raised questions that
everyone, willy-nilly, had to ponder seriously.
" 'Before his initiation into the dervish order, he had been a professional "watchmaker." 'And in the monastery he devoted all his spare time to this favorite craft
of his.
" 'My friend, the dervish Kerbalai Azis Nooaran, had recently, by the way,
become greatly intrigued by a certain "bizarre idea", he was trying to make a
mechanical watch that would show the exact time without the aid of any
spring whateve.r
"He explained this bizarre idea of his in the following brief and simple statement: " ' "Nothing on Earth is absolutely still, since the Earth itself moves On the
Earth, only weight is stable and then only in half the space occupied by its
volume I wish to obtain such a perfect equilibrium of the levers that their
movement, which must necessarily proceed from the tempo of the movement
of the Earth, should correspond exactly to the movement of the hands of a
clock, and so on and so forth.
" 'When I went to see this eccentric friend of mine and explained what I
wanted and what help I expected of him, he at once became very much
interested and promised to help me in every way he could.



" 'And the very next day we set to work together. " 'Through this joint effort, the skeleton of the mechanical musical
instrument I had devised was soon ready I myself marked the correct places
for the strings and stretched them, while my eccentric friend continued to
work on the mechanism of the little hammers.
" 'And when I had finished stretching the strings and was tuning them in
the required way, I made a discovery of such interest that it led me to the
experiments concerning the laws of vibrations which I am still pursuing today.
" 'It began in this way: " 'I must first tell you that, before this, I knew very well that half the length
of a string gives twice the number of vibrations of a whole string of equal
diameter and density, and according to this principle I arranged what are
called "bridges" for the strings on the "dulcimer" and then tuned all the strings
for a certain ancient sacred melody in "one-eighth tones," of course making
use of my "perambarsasidavan," or "tuning fork," as it is called in Europe,
which gave the vibrations of the Chinese absolute "do."
" 'It was while I was tuning the strings that I first noticed that the principle
according to which the number of vibrations of a string is inversely
proportional to its length does not always, but only sometimes, hold true in
relation to what is called a "common blending of harmonic consonance. "
'My discovery so interested me that I gave all my attention to the
investigation of this alone and entirely stopped working on the "dulcimer. "
'It so happened that my eccentric friend also became very interested in
the same thing, and we started to investigate together this fact which had
astonished us both.
'Only after several days did my friend and I notice that we were neglecting our
main work, and we therefore de



cided from that day on to devote half our time to finishing the "dulcimer" and
the other half to our investigations.
" 'And indeed we soon managed to carry out both of our tasks in such a way that one did not interfere with the other. " 'The mechanical "dulcimer" we had devised was soon ready and was
entirely satisfactory to us It turned out to be something like a modern "Greek
hand organ" but with quarter tones, and a little larger in size.
" 'It was set in action by turning, which made the small hammers strike the
corresponding strings, and this correspondence was obtained by means of
bundles of flattened reeds in which we had cut notches and into which the
heads of the hammers fell during the turning and thus started the strings
vibrating.
" 'For each sacred melody we prepared and fastened together a separate
bundle of these flattened reeds, which could be changed at will according to
the melody desired.
" 'When we finally handed over our unusual "dulcimer" to our sheikh and
told him what interested us most at that moment, he not only gave us his
blessing to leave the monastery for a while in order to devote ourselves to the
question which so engrossed us, but he even put at our disposal a large sum
of money from the reserves of the monastery.
" 'We then moved here and began to live far from other people and outside
of our brotherhood.
'My friend and I lived here the whole time in complete peace and
concord until recently, when I lost forever this never-to-be-forgotten and
irreplaceable friend of mine.
" 'And I lost him in the following lamentable circumstances:
" 'Several weeks ago he went down to the banks of the river Amu Darya to
the town of "X" to get various materials and instruments.
'As he was leaving the town to return here, a "stray bullet" from an exchange of shots between the Russians and



the Anglo-Afghans struck him down on the spot, and I was immediately informed of this calamity by a mutual acquaintance of ours, a Sart, who chanced to be passing by. " 'Several days later I brought his body back and buried it over there,' and he pointed to a corner of the cave where a curious mound could be seen. "Having said this, Hadji Asvatz Troov rose and made a gesture of prayer, evidently for the repose of the soul of his friend, and then motioned with his head for us to follow him.
"We started off and soon found ourselves once more in the main passage of
the cave, where this venerable terrestrial being stopped in front of a projection
of rock He pressed something, whereupon the rock divided, revealing the en
trance into another section of the cave..
"The section we now entered, both in its natural formation and in its artificial arrangement, was so original, according to the Reason of your contemporary favorites, that I wish to describe it to you in as much detail as possible. "The walls of this section, the ceiling, and even the floor were covered with several layers of very thick felt As was afterward explained to me, this natural cavern was utilized and adapted in such a way that there could not penetrate, either from the adjoining sections or from outside, the slightest vibration, no matter what its source, whether a movement, rustling, shuffling, or even the breathing, anywhere nearby, of various large or small 'creatures.' "In this extraordinary chamber were several experimental apparatuses of curious form, and among them was a sound-producing instrument like the one I brought with me from the surface of your planet, which your favorites call a 'grand piano.' "The top of the piano was open, and I could see that on each series of strings were fitted separate small apparatuses



that served to measure the 'degree of vivifyingness of vibrations from various
sources', and they were called 'vibrometers.'
"When I saw the number of these vibrometers, the being-impulse of
astonishment in my common presence rose to the pitch of intensity that our
Mullah Nasr Eddin characterizes in the following words: 'Beyond the limits
of satiety you burst.’
"This impulse of astonishment had been growing steadily in me from the
moment I saw the gas and electric lighting in the passages of the cave.
"I had been wondering ever since then where all this came from and how
it happened to be there.
"I was well aware that these strange three-brained beings had again
learned to utilize such sources issuing from cosmic formations for their as
they say 'lighting,' but I also knew that this lighting requires very complicated
equipment, which is accessible only where a large group of them has settled.
"Yet suddenly here was this lighting, far from any large settlement, and
moreover without any of the signs that generally accompany these
possibilities among contemporary beings.
"And when I saw the vibrometers for measuring the 'degree of
vivifyingness of vibrations,' my astonishment, as I already said, reached its
zenith.
"I was all the more amazed because, to my knowledge, at that period there
were no such apparatuses anywhere with which it was possible to count any
kind of vibrations, and again I asked myself—where could this venerable old
man, dwelling in these wild mountains, so far from beings representing
contemporary civilization, have obtained these apparatuses?
"Notwithstanding this interest of mine, I did not venture to ask the venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov for an explanation.



just then, and I did not venture to ask him because I feared that such a digressive question might change the course of our conversation, from which I expected the clarification of the question that interested me above all. "In this section of the cave were many other apparatuses as yet unknown to me, among which stood a very strange one to which were attached several 'masks,' as they are called From these masks, something like pipes, made of cows' gullets, went up to the ceiling of the cave. "Through these pipes, as I also learned later, the beings present during the experiments could take in from outside the air necessary for breathing, for at such times this interior was closed hermetically on all sides. "While the experiments were going on, the beings who were present wore over their faces the 'masks' that were connected to this strange apparatus. "When we were all seated on the floor in this part of the cave, the
venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov told us, among other things, that in the course
of his investigations he and his friend, the dervish Kerbalai Azis Nooaran,
also had occasion to study very thoroughly all the theories of vibrations ex
isting on the Earth, worked out in different epochs by serious terrestrial
scientists.
"He said 'We studied the Assyrian theory of the great Malmanakh, the Arabian theory of the famous Selneh Eh Avaz, and that of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras—and of course all the Chinese theories. " 'And we made apparatuses exactly like those which all these sages of
ancient times used for their experiments, we even added something to one of
them, and this is now the chief instrument for my experiments.
" 'It was with this instrument that Pythagoras made his experiments, and he
called it a "monochord," but now that I have altered it I call it a "vibrosho."
"Having said this, he pressed something on the floor with



one hand, and with the other pointed to a very strangely shaped apparatus,
remarking that this was the altered 'monochord.'
"The apparatus he pointed to consisted of a board, about two meters long,
with its front surface divided lengthwise into two halves One of these halves
was divided into sections by what are called 'frets,' like the neck of the sound
producing instrument called 'guitar,' and over the full length of this half was
stretched a single string.
"On the other half of the front of this board were fastened a great number
of 'vibrometers,' like those on the strings of the 'piano', and they were affixed
in such a way that their indicating needles came just over the frets on the other
half .
"On the back surface of the board was fastened a whole network of small
glass and metal pipes, also used to produce sounds, this time coming from
vibrations arising from certain movements and currents of ordinary, or
artificially compressed, or rarefied air For measuring the vibrations of these
sounds the same vibrometers were used as for measuring the vibrations
issuing from the single string.
"The venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov was about to say something more, but
just then a small boy of Uzbek type entered from another section of the cave,
carrying a tray with green tea and some cups.
"When the boy had set the tray before us and left, the venerable hadji
began to pour the tea into the cups and, turning to us, jokingly repeated the
following saying, customary on such occasions in that locality.
" 'Let us imbibe this gift of Nature in the devout hope that it may redound to her glory!'
"Then he added: 'I already feel my sustaining forces abating within me and so I must
absorb the due quantity of what can foster the animation of the whole of
myself until the next dose. '
"And with a gentle smile he began to drink his tea.



"While he was drinking it, I decided to take the opportunity to ask him several questions that had been troubling me all this time.
"First of all I asked him: " 'Highly esteemed Hadji' Until now I was fully convinced that nowhere on the Earth does there exist an apparatus for the exact measurement of vibrations Yet here I see any number of just such "measuring apparatuses."
" 'How am I to understand this? " 'Where did you get them?' "The venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov replied: " 'These apparatuses were made for our experiments by my deceased friend
Kerbalai Azis Nooaran, and it is chiefly to them that I owe all my attainments
in the science of the laws of vibrations .
'Long ago,' he continued, 'in the days when the great Tikliamish was flourishing, there existed on the Earth many such apparatuses, but at the present time there are none of them, except of course that "childish bauble" now found in Europe, with which vibrations can supposedly be counted and which is called a "siren " I myself had one of these "sirens" when I began my experiments. 'The siren was invented two centuries ago by a learned physician named Zehbek and was supposedly perfected in the middle of the last century by a certain Cagniard de la Tour. " 'This "bauble" is constructed in such a way that a current of compressed
air can be directed through a pipe on to a revolving disk, drilled with little
holes of exactly the same diameter as the opening of the pipe, which is
positioned so that as the disk revolves, the passage for the compressed air is
alternately opened and closed.
" 'And thus, during the regular revolution of this disk, successive shocks of air pass through the holes, producing a sound of even pitch, and the number of revolutions re



corded by a clock mechanism, multiplied by the number of holes in the disk,
gives the number of vibrations of sound in a given interval of time.
'Unfortunately for the Europeans, neither the inventor of that siren nor
the one who perfected it knew that sound can be obtained both from the action
of natural vibrations and from the simple flow of air; and as this siren of theirs
sounds only from the flow of air and not at all from natural vibrations, there
can be no question of determining the exact number of vibrations by the
indications of that siren. And the fact that sound can be produced from two
causes, that is, either from natural world-vibrations themselves or simply from
the flow of air, is indeed a most satisfying and interesting discovery, and now
I shall give you a practical demonstration of this.
"Having said this, the venerable hadji stood up and brought from another
part of the cave a pot of flowers in full bloom which he placed in the middle
of the chamber, he then seated himself at the 'vibrosho,' the former
'monochord' of the famous Pythagoras.
"Turning to us he said: 'I will now produce from this network of pipes only five distinct tones,
and you, please pay attention to this pot of flowers and check your watches to
note how long I continue to produce these tones, keep in mind also the figures
indicated by the needles of the vibrometers.'
"Then with a small bellows he began to blow air into the corresponding
pipes, which then produced a monotonous melody of five tones.
"This monotonous melody lasted for ten minutes, and not only did we
remember the figures indicated by the needles of the vibrometers but the five
tones were very strongly impressed on our organs of hearing.
"When the hadji stopped his monotonous music, the flowers in the pot
were as fresh as before.



"He then moved from the former 'monochord' to the sound-producing instrument called the 'piano' and, again directing our attention to the vibrometer needles, he began to strike in succession the corresponding keys of the piano, which produced the same monotonous melody of five tones. "During this time, the needles of the vibrometers indicated the same figures as before. "Five minutes had barely passed when, at a nod from the hadji, we looked at the flowers and saw that they had definitely begun to fade, and when, at the end often minutes, the venerable hadji again stopped his music, there was nothing left in the pot but the withered stalks of the formerly flowering plant.
"Then the hadji sat down beside us again and said: " 'As my long years of investigation have convinced me and as the science
of "shat-chai-mernis" states, there do indeed exist in the world two kinds of
vibrations namely, "creative vibrations" and "momentum vibrations."
" 'I have made clear by experiment that the best strings for producing "creative vibrations" are those made either of a certain metal or of goat gut " 'Strings made of other materials do not have this property and the vibrations issuing from them, like those obtained from the flow of air, are purely momentum vibrations In such a case the sounds are produced by vibrations arising from the mechanical action of momentum and from the friction of the resulting flow of air. '
"Hadji Asvatz Troov continued: " 'At first we made our experiments with the aid of this "vibrosho" alone
But one day, when my friend Kerbalai Azis Nooaran was in the Bukharian
town of "X" on business, he happened to see a grand piano at an auction of
some things belonging to a Russian general who was moving away, and
noticing that its strings were made of the very metal needed for our
experiments, he bought it and after



ward, with great difficulty, as you may imagine, had it brought up here into
the mountains.
" 'When we had put this piano in place, we tuned its strings exactly
according to the laws of vibrations indicated in the ancient Chinese science of
"shat-chai-mernis. "
'To tune the strings correctly we not only took as the basis the "absolute
do" of the ancient Chinese scale but also, as this science recommended, took
into account the local geographical conditions, the atmospheric pressure, the
form and dimensions of the interior, the mean temperature of the surrounding
space as well as of this interior itself, and so on, and we even took into
consideration the total number of emanations from the human beings who
would be present during our proposed experiments.
'From the moment we had accurately tuned the piano in this way, the
vibrations issuing from it did in fact acquire all the properties spoken of in
that great science.
" 'I will now demonstrate what it is possible to do with the vibrations
issuing from this ordinary piano, by applying the knowledge of the laws of
vibrations attained by man '
"Having said this, he again stood up. "This time, he brought an envelope, paper, and a pencil from another part
of the cave.
"He wrote something on the paper, put it in the envelope, and attached it
to a hook hanging from the center of the ceiling Then he sat down once more
at the piano and, without saying a word, began as before to strike certain
keys, which again produced a monotonous melody.
"But this time, in the melody, two sounds of the lowest octave of the piano
were evenly and steadily repeated.
"After a little while, I noticed that it was becoming uncomfortable for my friend the dervish Hadji Bogga Eddin to sit still, and he began fidgeting with his left leg. "Soon he began to rub his leg, and it was evident from the grimaces he made that it was hurting him.



"The venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov paid no attention to this but went on striking the same keys. "When at last he had finished, he turned to us and, addressing me, said
'Friend of my friend, will you please get up, take the envelope off the hook, and read what is written inside. ' "I stood up, took the envelope, opened it, and read aloud as follows: " 'On each of you, from the vibrations issuing from the piano, there must
be formed on the left leg an inch below the knee and half an inch to the left of
the middle of the leg what is called a "boil. " '
"When I had read this, the venerable hadji requested us both to bare the
indicated places on our left legs.
"When we had done so, we saw a 'boil' precisely on that spot on the left
leg of the dervish Bogga Eddin, but to the great amazement of the venerable
Hadji Asvatz Troov, there was nothing whatever to be seen on my leg.
"When Hadji Asvatz Troov ascertained this, he instantly leaped from his
place like a young man and cried out very excitedly, 'This cannot be!' And he
stared fixedly at my left leg with the eyes of a madman .
"Almost five minutes passed in this manner I must confess that for the first
time on that planet I was at a loss and could not immediately hit upon a way
out of this predicament.
"At last he came up to me and was about to speak, but he was so agitated
that all at once his legs began to tremble so violently that he had to sit down
on the floor, and he motioned me to sit down also.
"When we were seated, he gazed at me with very sorrowful eyes and, in a penetrating tone, spoke to me as follows: 'Friend of my friend! In my youth I was a very rich man, so rich that no fewer than ten of my caravans, each



with no fewer than a thousand camels, were constantly moving in all
directions over our great Asia .
'My harem was considered by knowledgeable people to be the best and
the most sumptuous on the Earth, and everything else was on the same scale,
in short, I had in superabundance everything that our ordinary life can give
" 'But gradually all this so wearied and surfeited me that at night when I
lay down to sleep I thought with horror that it would all be repeated the next
day and I would again be weighed down by the same wearisome burden.
" 'Finally it became unendurable for me to live with such an inner state.
" 'And then, one day, when I felt the emptiness of ordinary life particularly
strongly, the idea arose in me for the first time of ending my life by suicide.
'For several days, I thought about it quite cold-bloodedly, and as a result
categorically decided to do this:
'On the last evening, as I entered the room where I intended to carry out
this decision of mine, I suddenly remembered that I had not taken a last look
at the being who was half the cause of the creation and formation of my life.
'I remembered my mother, who was then still alive. And this
recollection reversed everything within me.
'I suddenly pictured to myself how she would suffer when she learned of
my death, and especially by such a means
" 'Remembering her, I could see my dear old mother, as if in reality,
breaking down in utter loneliness and inconsolable grief, and I was so
overcome by pity for her that my sobs almost choked me.
" 'And it was only then that I recognized with my whole being what my
mother meant to me and what an inextinguishable feeling I should have had
for her.
'From that hour my mother became for me the source of my life.



" 'Thereafter, whatever the time, day or night, no sooner did I remember
her dear face than I became animated with new strength, and the desire was
renewed in me to live and to do everything in such a way that her life would
flow agreeably for her.
" 'Thus it continued for ten years—until she died of one of those pitiless diseases and I was again left alone. " 'After her death my inner emptiness weighed me down more and more
each day.
"At this point in his narrative, the glance of the venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov happened to light on the dervish Bogga Eddin. He jumped up hurriedly and said to him: 'Dear friend! In the name of our friendship pardon me, an old man, for
having forgotten to put an end to the pain caused you by the evil-bearing
vibrations of the piano.
"Thereupon he sat down at the piano and again struck the keys, producing
the sounds of only two notes, alternately one from the highest octave and the
other from the lowest, and as he did so he almost shouted:
" 'Now thanks to the vibrations produced by the sounds of this same
piano, but this time "good-bearing ones," let the pain of my faithful old friend
come to an end. '
"And indeed five minutes had scarcely passed when the face of the
dervish Bogga Eddin again cleared up, and not a trace remained of the
enormous, horrible boil which had adorned his left leg .
"Then the dervish Hadji Asvatz Troov sat down beside us again and,
having outwardly regained his calm, continued to speak:
" 'On the fourth day after the death of my dear mother, I was sitting in my
room in despair, wondering what would become of me.
" 'Just then in the street near my window a wandering dervish began
chanting his sacred canticles.
" 'Looking out of the window and seeing that the dervish



was old and had a benign face, I suddenly decided to ask his advice, and
immediately sent my servant to invite him in.
" 'When he had entered and, after the customary greetings, was seated on
the "mindari," I told him of the state of my soul, without concealing anything
at all.
'' 'When I had finished, the dervish became deeply thoughtful, remaining
silent for some time, then he looked at me steadily and said, as he rose from
his place.
"There is only one way out for you—devote yourself to religion. "
" 'Having said this, he walked away intoning a prayer, and left my house
forever.
" 'After he had gone, I again began to ponder. " 'This time, the result of my pondering was that the same day I decided,
irrevocably, to enter a "brotherhood of dervishes"—not in my native country
but somewhere far away.
" 'The next day I began to divide and distribute all my wealth among my
relatives and the poor, and two weeks later I left my native country forever
and came here to Bukhara.
" 'Once in Bukhara, I entered one of the numerous "dervish brotherhoods,"
selecting the one whose dervishes were known among the people for the
austerity of their mode of life.
" 'Unfortunately, the dervishes of this brotherhood soon had a
disillusioning effect on me, and I therefore transferred to another brotherhood,
but there again the same thing happened.
'Finally I was admitted into the monastery whose sheikh set me the task
of devising the mechanical stringed instrument I have already told you about.
'After that, as I have also told you, I became passionately interested in
the science of the laws of vibrations and have studied it unceasingly up to the
present day.



" 'But today this science compels me to suffer the same inner state that I experienced on the eve of the death of my mother, my love for whom had been the sole hearth of warmth that for so many years sustained my empty and wearisome life. " 'To this day I cannot recall without a shudder the moment when our physicians told me that my mother could not live another day. " 'In that terrible state of mind, the first question that arose in me was how shall I go on living?
" 'What happened afterward I have already told you. 'In a word, as I became absorbed in the science of vibrations, I gradually
found a new divinity.
'This science took the place of my mother for me and during many years
has proved just as sustaining, true, and faithful as my own mother had been,
and to this day I have lived and been animated by its truths alone.
" 'Until now there has not been a single instance in which the truths I have
discovered concerning the laws of vibrations failed to yield in their
manifestations the precise results I expected..
" 'But today, for the first time, the results I confidently expected did not
appear.
'What torments me the most is that today I was more careful than ever in
calculating the vibrations required for the given case, that is to say, I
calculated exactly that the boil should appear in just that place on your body
and nowhere else.
'And here the unprecedented has happened Not only is there no boil in
the designated place but none has been formed on any part of your body at all.
" 'This science, which until now has taken the place of my faithful mother,
has failed me today for the first time, and there is present in me at this
moment an indescribable sorrow.



'Today, I can still reconcile myself to this appalling misfortune, but what
tomorrow will be I cannot even picture to myself.
'And if today I can still somehow reconcile myself, it is simply because I
remember very well the words of our great prophet of ancient times, Esai
Noora, who said, "Only when in death agony is an individual not responsible
for his manifestations.
'Evidently my science, my divinity, my second mother, is also in its
death agony, if it has now betrayed me .
'I know very well that death agony is always followed by death.
" 'And you, dear friend of my friend, have involuntarily taken the place of
those physicians who on the eve of my dear mother's death announced to me
that she could not live another day.
'For you are the bearer of just such news, telling me that tomorrow this
new hearth of mine will also be extinguished.
'The same terrible feelings and sensations are surging up in me as I
experienced from the moment our physicians announced the imminent death
of my mother until she actually died.
" 'Just as then, in the midst of those terrible feelings and sensations, there
was still the hope that perhaps she would not die, so now, something like that
hope is still flickering in me.
" 'Ekh! Friend of my friend! Now that you know the state of my soul, I
beseech you, can you explain to me through what supernatural force the boil
that should infallibly have been formed on your left leg did not appear?
'For the certainty that it would infallibly be formed was based on a faith
that long ago became as unshakable in me as the "Tookloonian stone. "
'And it has become so firm and unshakable because for



almost forty years, day and night, I have persistently studied these great laws
of world vibrations, until the understanding of their meaning and of their
actualization has become, as it were, my second nature. '
"Having said these words, this sage—perhaps the last great sage of the
Earth—looked into my eyes with an expression full of anticipation.
"Can you picture to yourself, my dear boy, the predicament I was in?
What could I reply to him?
"For the second time that day, I could not see any way out of the situation
that had arisen on account of this terrestrial being.
"And this time that state, so unusual for me, was permeated with my
'being-hikdjnapar' or, as your favorites say, 'pity,' for that terrestrial three
brained being, chiefly because he was suffering on my account.
"And this was because I was clearly aware that a few words would have
sufficed not only to calm him but to make him understand that the absence of
a boil on my left leg proved the truth and precision of his adored science still
more.
"I had full moral right to tell him the truth about myself, since by his
attainments he had already become 'kalmanuior,' that is, a three-brained being
of that planet with whom it is not forbidden us from Above to be sincere.
"But I could not possibly do this at that moment in the presence of the
dervish Hadji Bogga Eddin, who was still an ordinary three-brained being,
that is, one of those terrestrial beings to whom the members of our tribe had
long since been forbidden, under oath from Above, to communicate true
information in any circumstances whatsoever.
"It seems that this interdiction was imposed upon the beings of our tribe
on the initiative of the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash.
"And this interdiction was imposed on our tribe chiefly



because it is indispensable for the three-brained beings of your planet to have
'knowledge of being.'
"Any information, even if true, in general gives beings only 'mental
knowledge,' and this 'mental knowledge,' as I have already told you, serves
them merely as a factor to lessen their possibilities of acquiring 'knowledge of
being.'
"And since this 'knowledge of being' is the sole means left to your
unfortunate favorites for their final liberation from the consequences of the
properties of the organ kundabuffer, this command concerning the beings of
the Earth was given under oath to the beings of our tribe.
"And that is why, my boy, in the presence of the dervish Bogga Eddin, I
refrained from explaining to this worthy terrestrial sage Hadji Asvatz Troov
the real reason for his failure.
"But as both dervishes were waiting for my reply, I had in any case to tell
them something, and so, addressing Hadji Asvatz Troov, I simply said this:
'Venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov! If you agree to have my answer not now
but a little later, I swear, by the cause of my arising, that I will give you an
answer that will fully satisfy you. You will not only be convinced that your
beloved science is the truest of all sciences but will also realize that you
yourself, since the saints Choon-Kil-Tess and Choon-Tro-Pel, are the greatest
scientist of the Earth. '
"On hearing my reply, the venerable dervish Hadji Asvatz Troov merely
placed his right hand where the heart is found in terrestrial beings, and in that
locality this gesture means, 'I believe and hope without doubt. '
"Then, as if nothing had happened, he turned to the dervish Bogga Eddin
and began to speak again about the science of 'shat-chai-mernis.'
"In order to smooth over the previous embarrassment, I pointed to a niche
in the wall where many rolls of colored silk fabrics were piled up, and asked
him:



" 'Most estimable Hadji' What is all that material for, over there in the niche?' "To this question of mine he replied that these colored fabrics were also used for his experiments on vibrations, and he went on to say: " 'I recently made it clear to myself which colors act harmfully by their vibrations on people and animals, and to what extent. " 'If you wish I will also show you this highly interesting experiment. ' "Whereupon he got up again and went into the adjoining section of the cave, from which, with the help of the boy, he soon led in three quadruped terrestrial beings called a 'dog,' a 'sheep,' and a 'goat', he also brought in several strangely shaped devices resembling bracelets. "He put one of these special bracelets on the arm of the dervish Bogga Eddin, and another on his own, saying to me as he did so. " 'I am not putting one of these on you . . . as I have rather weighty reasons for not doing so. "He next put one of these strange collar-like devices around the neck of each of the animals and, indicating the vibrometers on these devices, asked us to remember or write down all the figures indicated by the needles of the vibrometers on each of these outwardly different beings. "We looked at the figures shown by all five vibrometers, and wrote them
down on writing pads that the boy had given us.
"Then the dervish Asvatz Troov came and sat down again on the felt, and
told us the following:
" 'Every form of "life" has its own "totality of vibrations" proper to it, which represents the sum of the vibrations engendered by all the separate organs of that form of life And in every form of life this sum varies at different times, depending on how intensely the corresponding



sources, or organs, transform these vibrations of diverse origin. 'Now within the limits of a whole life, all these heterogeneous vibrations
of diverse origin always blend into what is called the general "subjective
chord of vibrations" of that life.
'Just take, as an example, my friend Bogga Eddin and myself.
" 'You see . . . ' and showing me the figures on the vibrometer on his arm,
he continued:
" 'I have a totality of so-and-so many vibrations, and my friend Bogga
Eddin has so many more.
'This is because he is much younger than I and some of his organs
function much more intensively than mine, thereby producing in him
corresponding vibrations that are much more intense.
'Now look at the figures on the vibrometers of the dog, the sheep, and
the goat The sum total of the vibrations of the dog is three times greater than
that of the sheep, and one and a half times greater than that of the goat, while
the total number of vibrations of its general chord of vibrations is only a trifle
less than mine and that of my friend.
" 'But it must be remarked that, especially in recent times, there are many
men to be met with who have not even as great a number of vibrations in the
"subjective chord of vibrations" of their common presence as the number
shown for the presence of this dog.
'This has come about because in most of these people one of the
functions, namely, the function of emotion, which gives the greatest number
of subjective vibrations, is almost completely atrophied, and so the sum total
of the vibrations in them proves to be less than in this dog. '
"With these words, the venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov got up again and went to the place where the fabrics of different colors lay.



"He began to unroll these colored fabrics woven out of 'Bukharian silk,' color by color Taking one color at a time and using specially constructed rollers, he covered not only all the walls and the ceiling but even the floor of the room, so that the whole interior space was draped with material of the same color And each time the color was changed, the total number of vibrations of each form of life was altered. "After these experiments with the colored materials, this great contemporary terrestrial scientist asked us to follow him, and leaving this part of the cave, we went back into the main passage and then entered another small passage leading off to one side. "Behind us trotted the goat, the sheep, and the dog with their improvised
collars.
"We walked for some time until we finally came to the principal chamber of this underground domain. "There the venerable dervish Hadji Asvatz Troov went over to a niche in one of the walls of that big underground space and, pointing to a large pile of material of a very strange color, he said: " 'This material is woven specially from the fibers of the plant "chaltandr" and has kept its natural colo.r " 'This plant, "chaltandr," is one of the rare formations on the Earth whose color does not have the property of changing the vibrations of other nearby sources, and is itself completely unaffected by all other vibrations . " 'That is why for my experiments on vibrations arising from sources other
than color, I ordered this particular material and had something like a large
"tent" made out of it, designed so that if one wished it could fill the whole of
this underground space, or be moved in any direction and given any shape
desired.
" 'And with this original "tent," I am now carrying out my experiments, namely, those experiments I call "archi



tectural," and these are making clear to me precisely what kind of interior spaces act harmfully upon people and animals, and to what extent. 'These "architectural" experiments have already fully convinced me, not only that the size and the general interior form of a place have an enormous influence on people and animals, but also that all interior "curves," "angles," "projections," "breaks" in the walls, and so on, bringing about changes in the vibrations proceeding in the atmosphere of the place, always contribute to improving or worsening the subjective vibrations of the people and animals there. "When he began making his experiments in our presence with this large
tent, I noticed among other things that the changing vibrations, acting in
response to various surrounding causes, affected the common presence of the
three-brained beings who have taken your fancy much more strongly than
that of the one-brained and two-brained beings.
"Evidently this also is the consequence of the abnormal inner and outer conditions of their ordinary being-existence.
"After these architectural demonstrations, he led us to another small chamber
where he carried out many other experiments, through which it could easily
be seen and understood precisely which vibrations from various sources act
upon the 'subjective chord of vibrations' of your favorites, and in what manner.
"These experiments also showed the results caused by vibrations issuing
from the radiations of three-brained beings of various types or of two-brained
and one-brained beings, as well as those caused by the vibrations of their
voices and by those from many other sources.
"He also demonstrated and explained experiments that proved the harmful action on contemporary terrestrial beings of those supposedly intentional productions which



are found in great quantities, especially in recent times, and which they call 'works of art.' "Among them were 'pictures,' 'statues,' and of course their famous 'music ' "But from all the experiments conducted by this sage, it became evident
that the most harmful vibrations for contemporary terrestrial three-brained
beings are the ones produced in them by what they call 'medical remedies.'
"I stayed four terrestrial days in the underground domain of this truly learned
being, after which, with the dervish Bogga Eddin, I returned to that Bukharian
town whence we had come—and thus ended my first meeting with this
remarkable man.
"During those four days he demonstrated and explained a great deal more
to us about the laws of vibrations But the most interesting thing for me
personally was the explanation he gave us last of all, as to how and why, in
that wild place far from any settlement of contemporary three-brained beings,
gas and light existed in this underground domain of his.
"During his account, while telling us certain details, this highly
sympathetic terrestrial three-brained being could not restrain himself and
suddenly, in his sincerity, he began to weep, which so touched me that even
now I cannot forget it.
"Certain data, brought to light by this account of his, can serve your future
existence as good material for confrontation and can help you understand all
the results of what is called 'subjective destiny,' that is, the results that
generally occur in our Great Megalocosmos where a multitude of relatively
independent individuals arise and exist together.
"It often happens that when people exist together, 'destiny' for a separate
individual appears to be absolutely unjust



for him in the process of his personal existence, but for all the other beings
around him, there is harvested from this an abundance of just fruits—just,
that is, in the objective sense. And that is why I wish to tell you about this in
as much detail as possible, and will even try to repeat what he said, word for
word.
"He gave this account not long before our departure from this underground
domain, that is, from the place that convinced me that the results attained by
the Reason of former three-brained beings have not been entirely lost even on
your planet Although the subsequent generations of the beings of this peculiar
planet, on account of their abnormal being-existence, have ceased to
transmute in themselves the cosmic truths discovered by their ancestors, and
although these truths have not progressed there as they do everywhere else,
nevertheless they are automatically concentrated in that strange underground
kingdom of your planet, to await further development and perfecting by
future three-brained beings.
"Well then, when I asked the venerable Hadji Asvatz Troov about the
methods of obtaining the gas and electric lighting in this underground
kingdom of his, he related the following:
" 'These two kinds of lighting have entirely different origins, and each of them has its own separate story. " 'Gas lighting existed here almost from the very beginning, and was
installed on my initiative and that of my old friend, the dervish Kerbalai Azis
Nooaran.
" 'As for the electric lighting, it was brought here quite recently, on the
initiative of another friend of mine of European origin, who is still a young
man.
" 'I think it will be better if I tell you the story of each kind of lighting
separately.
" 'I will begin with the gas lighting.



" 'When we first moved here, there was a holy place not far away, called the "Sacred Grotto," to which pilgrims and devotees used to throng from all over Turkestan. " 'The popular belief was that there had once lived in this cave the famous
Khdrailav, who later was taken up alive into Heaven.
" 'It was further said in this popular belief that he was taken alive into
Heaven so unexpectedly that he even had no time to extinguish the fire that lit
his cave.
" 'And this last belief was supported by the fact that in that cave there was
indeed an "undying fire." 'And so, friend of my friend!
" 'As neither I nor my friend, the dervish Kerbalai Azis Nooaran, could
give credence to this popular belief, we decided to probe into the real cause of
that unusual phenomenon.
" 'Having at that time sufficient material resources at our disposal, and also
the conditions necessary for the investigation of this phenomenon without
hindrance from anyone, we set about trying to discover its origin.
" 'It turned out that not far from that cave was an underground stream,
which washed over a bed of minerals whose combined action on the water
resulted in the separation of an inflammable gas that found its way into the
cave through chance crevices in the ground.
'And this gas, somehow becoming ignited, must obviously have been
the cause of that "undying fire. "
" 'When my friend and I had made this clear to ourselves and had also
discovered that this source was located not far from our cave, we decided to
provide an artificial outlet for the gas into our cave.
'And ever since then this gas has flowed through the clay pipes we laid,
into the main part of the cave, and from there we have distributed it by means
of "bamboo canes" according to our needs.



'As for the origin of electric lighting in our cave, its history is as follows: 'Soon after we had settled here, there once came to see me, through a very old friend of mine who was also a dervish, a young European traveler who sought my acquaintance in order to discuss these same laws of vibrations which interested me. " 'We soon became close friends, as he turned out to be very serious in his search for truth, and also very kind and sensitive in regard to the weaknesses of all others without exception. 'He was studying the laws of vibrations in general, but his research was
primarily concerned with the vibrations that cause various diseases in people.
'These studies of his led him to discover, among other things, the causes in people of the disease they name 'cancer,' and the possibility of destroying this malignant arising. 'He then established and verified in practice the possibility that by a certain mode of life and a specific preparation any man can consciously elaborate certain vibrations in himself, by means of which—if he can saturate the afflicted person in a certain way and at certain definite times—this terrible disease can be destroyed entirely. 'After he left, we did not meet again for a long time, but we always had news of each other. " 'I knew that soon after we parted, this young friend of mine married in his native country, and during the following years lived with his wife "in full family love and mutual moral support," as we say here in Asia. 'I was particularly interested in receiving news of his achievements with the means he had discovered for destroying in people the aforesaid curse, since the causes of the vibrations that crystallize factors for that disease were closely related to the causes of those vibrations whose study had become the chief interest in my life.



" 'I already knew that the means he had discovered for the destruction of this disease were not generally accessible. However, I learned from many trustworthy reports that, although they were impracticable for others, he himself made use of these means as a treatment for those who fell ill and always achieved the complete destruction of this terrible human scourge. 'I received accurate information about the favorable results he achieved in several dozen cases during that time. " 'Then, for reasons not depending on either of us, I had no information
about that young European for about ten years.
" 'I was even beginning to forget his existence entirely when one day,
while I was specially absorbed in my occupations, I heard someone give our
secret signal, and when I called and asked who was there I at once recognized
his voice He asked me to open the passage for him so that he could enter our
underground domain.
" 'Needless to say, we were both very glad to meet again and to exchange
views once more on our beloved science of the "laws of vibrations."
" 'When the emotion aroused by our meeting had abated, and we had
unpacked all the things my young friend had brought on camels—which
included, by the way, one of the famous European "Roentgen apparatuses,"
about fifty "Bunsen elements," a number of "accumulators," and several bales
of different materials for electric wiring—we began to talk quietly From what
he recounted about himself I learned, with great sadness, the following:
" 'Several years before when, on account of world laws, surrounding
conditions and circumstances became such that scarcely anywhere on the
Earth did people have any security for the morrow or any settled dwelling
place, he suddenly noticed the symptoms in his beloved wife of that awful



disease whose cure had been one of the chief aims of his existence.
'He was particularly horrified, because the surrounding conditions
prevented him from employing the treatment he had discovered for the
destruction of that terrible disease, and which so far he alone could carry out.
'When he had somewhat calmed down after this terrible realization, he
made the only possible decision—to wait patiently for a more favorable time,
and meanwhile to try to create for his wife conditions of life in which the
progress of that malignant disease would be slowed down as much as
possible.
" 'More than two years passed During this time the surrounding conditions
changed for the better and at last it became possible for my young friend to
prepare himself to employ the means, known only by him, for combating that
dreadful disease.
'But while he was preparing himself to administer the cure, on one
sorrowful day for him, during some "demonstration" in one of the large
European cities, he was jostled by the crowd and knocked down by an
automobile, and although he was not killed, he was very seriously injured.
'Owing to these injuries, his own life flowed for several months in an
"unconscious state", and because he was unable to give a conscious and
intentional direction to the ordinary life of his wife, the process of her disease
developed at an accelerated tempo, all the more so because since his accident
she took constant and anxious care of him without sparing herself.
'And when this poor young friend of mine finally regained
consciousness, he saw to his horror that the process of the disease in his wife
was already in the last stages.
" 'What could he do? What could be done? The consequences of his
injuries deprived him of any possibility to prepare himself, and to elaborate in
himself that quality



of vibrations necessary for the means he had discovered to destroy this human curse. " 'Thereupon, seeing no other way, he resolved to have recourse to the
treatment employed by the representatives of contemporary European
medicine, which according to their conviction can destroy that disease.
'In other words, he decided to have recourse to what are called "X-rays. "
" 'So the treatment with X-rays was begun. 'In the course of the treatment he noticed that, whereas the principal
"concentration" or "center of gravity" of the disease in his wife's body was
becoming as it were atrophied, at the same time a similar "concentration" was
beginning to form in a different part other body.
'After several months of repeated "sessions," as they are called in Europe, a third independent concentration made its appearance, in still another place. 'And finally the time came when the days of the invalid were numbered.
'Faced with this horror, my young friend decided to abandon all the
wiseacring of contemporary European medicine and, without consideration
for his own state, he began to elaborate in himself the necessary vibrations
and to saturate the invalid's body with them.
'In spite of almost insurmountable difficulties he succeeded in prolonging the existence of his wife for almost two years, nevertheless she finally died of that terrible human disease. 'It must be added that during the last stage of the illness, when he had
already given up the wiseacring of European medicine, two new independent
concentrations were observed in the body of his wife.
'When my young friend had more or less calmed down after that terrible outcome, he devoted part of his time to his beloved studies and research on the great world laws,



and he applied himself particularly to finding out why it was that, during the
treatment of the "cancer" by X-rays there had arisen in his wife's body those
independent "concentrations" which usually do not develop in this disease
and which in his long years of previous study he had never come across
before.
" 'Since it turned out to be very complicated to investigate this problem,
and moreover impracticable in the surrounding conditions in which he was
living, he decided to come to me and with my help solve it by experiment.
" 'And that was why he had brought all the necessary materials with him for these experiments. " 'The next day I put at his disposal one of the sections of our underground
domain as well as several what are called "Salmamoorsian goats" and
everything else he might need for his research.
" 'Among other preparations, he first put the Roentgen apparatus into
operation by means of the Bunsen elements.
'And three days after his arrival, he made a discovery which led to the
origin of the permanent electric lighting in our caves.
" 'And it began in the following way: " 'While we were making certain experiments, using my vibrometers, and
were calculating the vibrations of the electric current that produced X-rays in
the Roentgen apparatus, we noticed that the number of vibrations of the
current obtained by means of these Bunsen elements sometimes increased
and sometimes diminished, and since it was of the greatest importance for our
investigations to have a flow of current with a uniform number of vibrations
in a given time interval, it was soon obvious to us that this sort of electric
current was absolutely useless for our purposes.
'This realization very much discouraged and depressed my young friend.



" 'He immediately discontinued his experiments and began to think.
" 'The following two days he thought unceasingly, even while eating.
" 'At the end of the third day, as we were going together to the chamber
where we usually took our meals, and were crossing the little bridge over an
underground stream in the main part of the cave, he suddenly stopped and,
striking his forehead, cried out excitedly, "Eureka!"
" 'The outcome of that exclamation was that on the next day, with the help
of several Tadjiks he had hired, he transported from some nearby ancient and
abandoned mines lumps of three kinds of ore—the largest that could be
moved—and these were placed in a certain order in the bed of our
underground stream.
" 'Then after laying the ore in the bed of the stream, he installed two
terminals in the stream, and connected them in a very simple way to the
accumulators, which he had slightly modified As a result, an electric current
of a certain amperage began to flow into these accumulators.
'And when after twenty-four hours we connected our vibrometers to the
electric current thus obtained, it turned out that although its amperage was not
sufficient, the number of vibrations produced by that electric current remained
unchanged and absolutely uniform during the whole time of its passage
through the vibrometers.
'To increase the force of the electric current obtained in this original
way, he made "condensers" out of various materials, namely, from
"goatskins," a certain kind of "clay," crushed "zinc ore," and "pine resin," thus
producing an electric current of the amperage and voltage required for the
Roentgen apparatus he had brought.
'By means of this unusual source of electric current, we eventually
proved to ourselves the following:



'Although this contemporary European invention for the treatment by X
ray of the above-mentioned terrible disease in the whole body of man brings
about the atrophy of its "center of gravity," it nevertheless greatly facilitates
"metastases" in other parts of the body, and favors the seeding and
development of the disease in these new places 'And so, friend of my friend!
" 'Once he had become satisfied with this elucidation, my young friend
ceased to be interested in the question that had absorbed him, and he returned
home to Europe, leaving for our use that source of light which he had created
and which required neither attention nor any outside material, and thereafter
we gradually installed electric lamps wherever we needed them.
" 'Although this unusual source of ours cannot generate sufficient energy
for all the lamps we have in our caves, yet by putting switches everywhere
and using the energy only when necessary, it is not wasted and gradually fills
the accumulators, sometimes even in such quantity that there is a surplus for
various domestic purposes.
At this place in Beelzebub's tales, all the passengers of the trans-system
ship Karnak experienced something like a sweet-sour taste in their mouths.
This signified that the ship Karnak was approaching some planet where it
was about to make a stop that was not originally planned.
This planet was the planet "Deskaldino." Whereupon Beelzebub interrupted his tale and returned to his 'kesshah,' as
did Ahoon and Hassein, to get ready for the descent to the planet Deskaldino.
NOTE If anyone is, by chance, interested in the ideas presented in this
chapter—seriously interested, not taking them "lightly" as contemporary
people usually do—and if he is endowed with physical, moral, psychic, and
material data whose quality is satisfactory



according to my understanding, I earnestly advise him to mobilize his forces and, above all, bring together in himself the requisite conditions for becoming worthy to be an "all-rights-possessing pupil" of my "universal laboratory"—the laboratory I intend to open after completing my writings, and the creation of which will be connected with the last phase of my intense activity for the good of all mankind.

CHAPTER 42
Beelzebub in America
Two "DIANOSKS" later, when the intersystem ship Karnak had resumed its falling, and the confirmed followers of our respected Mullah Nasr Eddin had sat down again in their usual seats, Hassein turned once more to Beelzebub with the following words: "Dear Grandfather! May I remind you, as you told me to do, about those . . . those three-brained beings of the planet Earth . . . what are they called? the beings who breed and exist on the diametrically opposite side of the planet where contemporary terrestrial civilization is flourishing those three-brained beings who, as you were saying, are great devotees of the 'fox trot. ' "
"Ah! You mean those Americans?" "Yes, that's it, those Americans'" joyously exclaimed Hassein.
"Of course, I remember, I did promise to tell you something about those contemporary 'oddballs. '
And Beelzebub began thus: "I happened to visit that part of the surface of your planet now called 'North America' just before my final departure from that solar system. "I went there from the city of Paris on the continent of Europe, which had
been my last chief place of existence on that planet.
"I sailed there from the continent of Europe on a 'steamship,' according to
the custom of all contemporary what are called 'dollar holders,' and arrived in
the capital city of North America, the city of 'New York' or, as it is sometimes
called there, 'the melting pot of the peoples of the earth. '
"From the pier I went straight to a hotel called the 'Majes



tic,' which had been recommended to me by one of my Paris acquaintances and which, for some reason or other, was additionally, though not officially, called 'Jewish.' "Having settled in this 'Majestic Hotel,' I went the same day to look up a certain 'Mister,' who had been recommended to me by another of my Paris acquaintance.s "On that continent every being of the male sex is called 'Mister' who does
not wear what is called a 'skirt. '
"When I found this 'Mister' to whom I had a letter of introduction, he was, as is proper to every genuine American businessman, up to his ears in countless, as is said there, 'dollar businesses.' "I think I might as well remark here at the very beginning of my narrative about these Americans that almost all the contemporary three-brained beings who constitute the basic population of this part of the surface of your planet are occupied exclusively with these 'dollar businesses. ' "On the other hand, the trades and professions indispensable to the process of being-existence are practiced only by those beings from other continents who have gone there temporarily for the purpose, as is said, of 'earning money.' "In this connection, the conditions of ordinary being-existence among your
contemporary favorites, especially on this continent, have become
completely, as it were, 'tralalalooalalala' or, as our respected teacher Mullah
Nasr Eddin would say, 'like a soap bubble that lasts only as long as the air is
still.
"At the present time there, these surrounding conditions are such that if,
for some reason or other, all the professional specialists necessary for their
ordinary collective existence stopped coming from other continents to 'earn
money,' it is safe to say that within a month the whole established order of
their ordinary existence would completely break down, for there would be no
one among them who could even so much as bake bread.



"The chief cause of the gradual development of such an abnormality is, on
the one hand, the law they themselves established in regard to the rights of
parents over their children and, on the other hand, the setting up in children's
schools of what are called 'dollar savings banks,' with the aim of implanting in
children a love of these dollars.
"Owing to this, and to various other peculiar external conditions of
ordinary existence also established by them, this love of 'dollar business' and
of dollars themselves has become, in the common presence of each of the
inhabitants of this continent on reaching responsible age, the motivating force
of his 'feverish' existence.
"That is why every one of them is always doing 'dollar business,' and
moreover, always several at the same time.
"Although the 'Mister' to whom I had a letter of introduction was also very
busy with these 'dollar businesses,' he nevertheless received me very cordially
When he read the letter of introduction I presented, a strange process began in
him, which has been noticed even by certain of your favorites—it having
become inherent in contemporary beings—and which they call 'unconscious
preening. '
"And this strange process took place in him because the letter I presented
mentioned the recommendation of a certain other 'Mister' of my acquaintance,
who in the opinion of many, and also of this Mister, was considered, and
called behind his back, a 'smart operator,' that is to say, a 'dollar expert.'
"Although at first he was completely in the grip of this inherency, proper
to your contemporary favorites, nevertheless, as he talked with me, he
gradually calmed down, and eventually told me that he was 'ready to place
himself entirely at my disposal.' Suddenly, however, he remembered
something, and added that to his profound regret, owing to circumstances
entirely beyond his control, he could do nothing for me that day, but would
have to postpone things until



the following day, as he was extremely busy with important matters.
"And indeed, with the best will in the world, he could not have done
differently, for these unfortunate Americans, governed as they are by these
dollar businesses of theirs, can do what they please only on Sundays, whereas
it happened that the day I went to see him was not a Sunday.
"There on that continent, neither dollar businesses nor any others ever
depend upon the beings themselves, on the contrary, it is your favorites who
depend entirely on these businesses of theirs.
"In short, as that day was not a Sunday, this genuine 'American Mister'
was unable to do as he pleased, that is, to go with me and introduce me to the
people I needed, we therefore agreed to meet the following morning at a
definite place on their famous 'Broadway.'
"This Broadway is not only the principal street of New York but it is the
longest street in any of the large contemporary cities of your planet.
"So the next day I set off for the place agreed upon. "As the 'taxi' which I took to this place did not happen to come from one
of Mr Ford's factories, I arrived too soon, and this 'Mister' was not yet there.
"While waiting for him, I began to stroll about But as all the New York
what are called 'brokers' take their 'constitutional' before their famous 'quick
lunch' in just this part of Broadway, the crowd became so thick that, in order
to escape it, I decided to go and sit down somewhere in a spot from which I
could see my 'Mister' arriving.
"A suitable place seemed to be a nearby 'restaurant' from the windows of
which all the passers-by could be seen.
"By the way, I must say that nowhere else on that entire planet of yours, in
the places of existence of any other group of your favorites, are there so many
restaurants as in that city of New York They are particularly numerous in the



central part of the city, and the proprietors of these restaurants are chiefly
'Armenians,' 'Greeks,' and 'Russian Jews.'
"And now, my boy, in order that you may rest a little from active mentation, I wish for a while to confine myself entirely to the form of mentation of our dear teacher Mullah Nasr Eddin and to talk about a certain highly original custom which, during the last few years, has prevailed in these contemporary New York restaurants. "Inasmuch as the power-possessing beings of this community have recently strictly prohibited ordinary beings from producing, importing, and consuming what are called 'alcoholic beverages' and have given corresponding orders to those beings on whom they rest their hope for their peace of mind, it is now supposed to be almost impossible for ordinary beings to obtain such liquids Just the same, in these New York restaurants, various alcoholic beverages called 'arak,' 'douziko,' 'Scotch whisky,' 'Benedictine,' 'vodka,' 'Grand Marnier,' and many other 'alcoholic liquids,' under every possible kind of label, and made exclusively on what are called old 'barges' lying at sea off the shores of that continent, are to be had in any quantity you please. "The very 'tzimmes' of this practice lies in this, that if you point your little finger and cover one half of your mouth with your right hand, while uttering the name of any liquid you fancy, then immediately, without more ado, that liquid is served at the table—only in a bottle purporting to be lemonade or the famous French 'Vichy. ' "Now try with all your might to exert your will and to actualize in your
presence a general mobilization of your 'perceptive organs' so that, without
missing anything, you may absorb and transubstantiate in yourself everything
relating to just how these enumerated 'alcoholic beverages' are prepared at sea
on old barges off the shores of that continent.



"I regret very much that I failed to make myself thoroughly familiar with all the details of this contemporary terrestrial science. "The only thing I managed to learn was that in every recipe for these preparations there enter 'sulphuric,' 'nitric,' and 'hydrochloric' acids and, most important of all, the 'incantation' of the famous contemporary German Professor Kischmenhof. "This last ingredient, that is, Professor Kischmenhof's incantation for alcoholic liquids, is delightfully intriguing, and it works, so it is said, as follows: "First, there must be prepared, according to some old recipe already familiar to specialists in the business, a thousand bottles of liquid, precisely one thousand, because if there should be even one bottle more or one bottle less, the incantation will not work. "These thousand bottles must be placed on the floor and then a single bottle of any genuine alcoholic liquid, such as can be found anywhere, must very quietly be placed beside them, and kept there for a period often minutes, and then, very slowly, while scratching the right ear with the left hand, one must pronounce, with certain pauses, the said alcoholic incantation. "Thereupon, not only are the contents of the thousand bottles instantly
transformed into precisely that alcoholic liquid contained in the single bottle,
but each of the thousand even acquires the same label as that on the one bottle
of genuine alcoholic liquid.
"Among the incantations of this incomparable German Professor Kischmenhof, there are, as I learned, several positively stupefying ones. "This famous German professor, a specialist in this branch, started 'inventing' these remarkable incantations of his quite recently, that is, in the early years of the recent great European process of reciprocal destruction.



"When a food shortage occurred in his fatherland, Germany, the great
professor, sympathizing with the plight of his compatriots, invented his first
magic formula, which consisted in the preparation of a very cheap and
economical 'chicken soup. '
"This first formula of his is called 'German chicken soup,' and is carried
out in an extremely interesting manner, as follows:
"Into a very commodious pot, set on the stove, ordinary water is poured
and then a few very finely chopped leaves of parsley are sprinkled into it.
"Both doors of the kitchen must now be opened wide or, if there is only
one door, a window must be opened wide and, while the incantation is
pronounced very loudly, a chicken must be chased through the kitchen at full
speed.
"Thereupon a most delicious 'chicken soup' is ready, hot in the pot.
"I heard further that during the years of that great process of reciprocal
destruction, the beings of Germany made use of this magic formula on a
colossal scale, as this method of preparing 'chicken soup' proved in practice to
be, as it were, good, or at least extremely economical.
"The point is that a single chicken could do duty for quite a long time,
because it could be chased and chased and chased, until for some reason or
other, all by itself, the chicken, as is said there, 'went on strike' and declined to
breathe the air any longer.
"And in the event that the chicken, in spite of its having existed among
your favorites, resisted the infection of hypocrisy and indeed no longer wished
to breathe, then, as I afterward learned, the beings of that community called
'Germany' established the following custom
"Namely, when the chicken 'went on strike,' its owners would very
solemnly roast it in the oven, and to celebrate



this occasion would unfailingly invite all their relatives to dinner.
"In this connection, it is interesting to note that another famous professor
of theirs, named Steiner, in the course of his what are called 'scientific
investigations of supernatural phenomena,' established mathematically that
when these chickens were served at these 'invitation dinners,' the hostess
would always recite the same little speech.
"Each hostess, rolling her eyes to heaven and pointing to the chicken,
would say with great feeling that it was a genuine 'Pamir pheasant,' specially
sent to them from the Pamirs by their dear nephew who was stationed there as
consul for their great 'fatherland.'
"On that planet there are incantations for every possible kind of purpose.
"The number of these incantations began to multiply after many of the
beings of this peculiar planet had become specialists in supernatural
phenomena, and came to be called 'occultists,' 'spiritualises,' 'theosophists,'
'violet magicians,' 'chiromancers,' and so forth.
"Besides being able to create 'supernatural phenomena,' these specialists
also knew very well how to make 'the opaque appear transparent. '
"The prohibition of the consumption of alcohol in America gives us another
enlightening example for understanding to what extent the possibility of
crystallizing data for sane being-reflection has atrophied in these
contemporary responsible power-possessing beings, since such an absurdity is
actually being repeated there.
"Thanks to this prohibition, everybody without exception on that continent
now consumes alcohol—even those who in other circumstances would
probably never have done so.
"There on the continent of America, the very same thing



is occurring with the consumption of alcohol as occurred in the country of Maralpleicie with the chewing of the seeds of the poppy. "The difference is that the beings in the country of Maralpleicie were addicted to the use of genuine poppy seeds, whereas in America, the beings now consume any liquid that comes their way, provided that it bears the name of an alcoholic liquid that exists somewhere on their planet. "And another difference is that when it comes to concealing their use of the prohibited product from government eyes, the beings now breeding on the continent of America are by no means as naive as were those of the Maralpleician epoch. "To what lengths your contemporary favorites have gone in this respect,
you can understand very well from the following examples:
"At the present time, every young man whose 'mother's milk' is scarcely dry on his lips infallibly carries with him what seems to be a perfectly harmless-looking 'cigarette case' or 'cigar case', and, sitting in a restaurant or in one of their famous 'dance halls,' he casually produces this cigarette or cigar case from his pocket and everybody around him of course supposes that he is about to smoke. "But not a bit of it! He just gives a peculiar little twist to this cigarette or cigar case and presto, a diminutive tumbler appears in his left hand, whereupon with his right hand he very slowly and very quietly pours out for himself from this cigarette or cigar case into his diminutive tumbler some kind of liquid—probably Scotch whisky, but concocted as I have already told you on some old barge off the American coast. "Once during my observations I witnessed another picture. "In one of these restaurants, not far from my table, sat two young American women.



"An attendant or, as they say, a 'waiter,' brought them a bottle of some mineral water and a couple of glasses. "One of the women gave a little twist to the handle of her fashionable
umbrella, whereupon a liquid, probably Scotch whisky or something of the
kind, began to flow from the handle, also very quietly, and very slowly, into
their glasses.
"In short, my boy, on this continent of America the same thing is being
repeated as took place quite recently in the large community called Russia,
where the power-possessing beings also prohibited the consumption of the
famous 'Russian vodka,' with the result that these beings soon accustomed
themselves to drinking, instead of vodka, the no less famous 'hanja,' from the
effects of which thousands of these unfortunate beings are still dying there
daily.
"But in the present case, we must certainly give the contemporary
American beings their due In their skill at concealing their consumption of
alcohol from the authorities, they are infinitely more 'civilized' than the
beings of the community of Russia.
"Well, my boy, as I was saying, to avoid the bustle of the street I entered a
typical New York restaurant and, taking a seat at one of the tables, began to
gaze out of the window at the crowd.
"And since it is the custom everywhere on your planet, when one sits in a
restaurant or any other such public place, always to order and pay for
something with what they call 'money' for the profit of the proprietor of the
establishment, I did the same and ordered for myself a glass of their famous
'orangeade.'
"This famous American drink consists of the juice squeezed from oranges
or from their famous 'grapefruit,' and the beings of that continent drink it,
always and everywhere, in incredible quantities.



"It must be admitted that this famous 'orangeade' does occasionally refresh
them in hot weather, yet in its action upon what are called the 'mucous
membranes' of the stomach and intestines this drink of theirs is another of the
many factors which, taken together, are leading—slowly but inevitably—to
the destruction of that 'unnecessary and negligible' function called the
'digestive function of the stomach. '
"Well then, sitting at the table with this famous orangeade and watching
the passers-by in the hope of catching sight of the Mister I was waiting for, I
began casually looking around at the objects in the restaurant.
"On the table at which I was sitting, I noticed among other things what is
called the 'menu' of the restaurant.
'Menu,' on your planet, is the name given to a sheet of paper on which
are written the names of all the varieties of food and drink served in that
restaurant.
"Looking over this paper, I found that no fewer than seventy-eight
different dishes could be ordered there that day.
"This staggered me, and I wondered what kind of a stove these Americans
must have in their kitchen to be able to prepare seventy-eight different dishes
on it in a single day.
"I should add that I had been on every one of the continents there and had
been the guest of a great many beings of different castes.
"And since I had seen food prepared innumerable times, in their houses
and also in my own, I already knew more or less that to prepare a single dish
one needed at least two or three saucepans. So I reckoned that as these
Americans prepared seventy-eight dishes in one kitchen they would certainly
need about three hundred pots and pans.
"I wanted to see for myself how it was possible to accommodate three
hundred saucepans on one stove, so I de



cided to offer what they call a good 'tip' to the waiter who had brought me the orangeade, to let me see the kitchen of the restaurant with my own eyes "The waiter somehow arranged it, and I went into the kitchen.
"When I got there, what do you think? What picture met my eyes? A stove with three hundred pots and pans?
"Not on your life . . . !! "What I saw was nothing but a 'midget' gas stove, like the ones in the rooms of 'confirmed bachelors,' or of 'man-haters,' that is to say, 'worthless old maids.' "By the side of this 'pimple of a stove' sat a bull-necked cook of Scottish origin reading the newspaper, inseparable from every American, in this case, it seems, the Times. "I looked around in amazement and I also looked at the bull neck of this
cook.
"As I was standing there dumbfounded, a waiter came into the kitchen
from the restaurant and, in a peculiar English, gave the bull-necked cook an
order for a certain very elaborate dish.
"From his accent I could tell that the waiter who ordered this dish with a fancy name had only recently arrived from the continent of Europe, obviously with the dream of filling his pockets with American dollars—that dream of every European who has never been to America, and which now allows no one in Europe to sleep in peace. "When this aspirant to 'American multimillionairedom' had ordered the fancy dish, the bull-necked cook got up from his place without haste, very heavily, and took down from the wall a small 'bachelor's frying pan,' as it is called there. "Then having lighted his 'midget stove' he put the frying pan on it, and still moving ponderously, he went



over to one of the many cupboards, took out a tin of some canned food, opened it, and emptied the entire contents into the pan. "Then in the same way he went over to another cupboard and took out another can of food, but this time he poured only a little of the contents into the frying pan and, having stirred the resulting mixture, he arranged the whole lot with precision on a plate which he set on the table, and again sat down in his former place and resumed the interrupted reading of his newspaper. "This bull-necked cook carried out the whole procedure with the most complete indifference, like a real automaton, it was visible from his movements that his thoughts were far away, doubtless where the events described by that American newspaper were taking place. "The waiter who had ordered this fancy dish soon came back to the kitchen bearing a very large copper tray on which were laid out a vast quantity of what is called 'fashionable cutlery' made of hollow metal and, having set the plate with this strange food on the tray, he carried the whole thing into the restaurant. "When I returned to my seat, I saw at another table nearby a 'Mister' who was smacking his lips over the dish that I had chanced to see prepared in the kitchen. "Looking out of the window again, I finally caught sight, in the crowd, of the Mister I expected, so, settling my bill at once, I left the restaurant.
"And now, my boy, maintaining the form of mentation of our dear teacher, I
might as well tell you a little about the 'language' of these American beings.
"You must know that before my arrival on that continent I could already speak the tongue of the beings living there, namely, what is called 'English. '
"But from the very first day of my arrival in the capital



of this North America, I experienced great difficulty in making myself understood because, as it turned out, although these beings use English for verbal intercourse among themselves, this 'English' of theirs is rather special and in fact quite peculiar. "So, having experienced this difficulty, I made up my mind to learn this peculiar 'conversational English' of theirs. "On the third day after my arrival, I was on my way to ask the Mister I had Just met to recommend a teacher for this 'English language,' when I suddenly saw, reflected in the sky by projectors, an 'American advertisement' with the words:
SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES BY THE SYSTEM OF MISTER
CHATTERLITZ
13 North 293rd Street
"The languages that were taught and the time it would take to learn each one were set forth As regards the 'American English language,' it was stated in particular that this could be learned in from five minutes to twenty-four hours. "At first I could not make head or tail of it, but all the same I decided to go the next morning to the address indicated. "On the following day, when I found this Mr Chatterlitz, he received me in
person, and when he heard that I wished to learn the 'American English
language' by his system, he explained to me first of all that this conversational
language could be learned in three forms, each form corresponding to some
special requirement.
" 'The first form,' he said, 'teaches the conversational language to a man who is absolutely obliged to earn our American dollars. 'The second form is suitable for a man who, although not in need of our dollars, nevertheless likes to do "dollar business," and in his social relations with us Americans likes



to be taken not for just anybody, but for a real "gentleman" with an English
upbringing.
'As for the third form, this is required by whoever wishes to be able to
procure, here, there, everywhere, and at any hour—Scotch whisky. '
"As the hours for the second form of learning the English language suited
me best, I decided to pay him immediately the dollars he charged for teaching
the secret of his system.
"When I had paid him the dollars and he had put them in an inside
pocket—with a casual air, but in reality not without that avidity which has
become proper to all the beings of your planet—he explained to me that in
order to learn this second form, only five words had to be memorized, namely:
1. maybe 2. perhaps 3. tomorrow 4. oh, I see 5. all right
"He said that if I had occasion to converse with one or more of their
'Misters,' I had only to utter any one of these five words every now and then.
'That will be quite enough,' he added, 'to convince everybody that in the
first place, you know the English language very well, and that second, you are
an "old hand" at doing dollar business.'
"Although the system of this highly esteemed Chatterlitz was very original
and no doubt effective, I never had occasion to put it into practice.
"And this was because the next day, by chance, I met in the street an old
acquaintance, a journalist of a newspaper from the continent of Europe, who
confided to me an even better secret for learning the American language.



"When I told him, among other things, that I had gone the day before to see
Mister Chatterlitz, and told him a little about his system, he replied:
" 'Do you know what, my dear doctor? As you are a subscriber to our paper
over there, I can't resist letting you in on a certain secret of the local language.
"And he added: 'Since you already know several of our European languages, you can
master the language here to perfection by employing this secret of mine, and
talk about anything you wish, and not simply make others think that you know
English—for which purpose, I do not deny, the system of this Chatterlitz is
indeed excellent. '
"He then explained that when pronouncing any word of any European
language, if you imagine that you have a hot potato in your mouth, some word
of the English language is in general bound to come out.
" 'And furthermore, if you imagine that this hot potato is well sprinkled
with "ground red pepper," then you will have the pronunciation of the local
American English language to a T. '
"He advised me moreover not to be timid in choosing words from
European languages since English is composed of a fortuitous mixture of
almost all European languages, and hence contains several words for every
ordinary idea, with the consequence that 'you almost always hit on the right
word.'
" 'And even supposing, without knowing it, you use a word that doesn't
exist in this language, no great harm is done, at worst, your hearer will only
think that he himself is ignorant of it.
" 'All you have to do is just bear in mind the hot potato and no more
"baloney" about it
" 'I guarantee this secret, and I will go so far as to say



that if, on following my advice, your "American English" does not prove to be ideal, you may cancel your subscription to our newspaper. '
"Several days later, I had to go to the city of Chicago. "This city is the second largest on that continent and is, one might say, a second capital of North America. "On seeing me off for Chicago, my New York acquaintance gave me a letter of introduction to a certain 'Mister' there. "As soon as I arrived in the city of Chicago, I went straight to this 'Mister. ' "This Chicago 'Mister' turned out to be very amiable and obliging.
"His name was Mister Bellybutton. "On my first evening there, this amiable and obliging Mr Bellybutton suggested that I accompany him to the house of some friends of his so that, as he expressed it, I should not be 'bored' in a strange city.
"I of course agreed. "When we arrived there, we found a fair number of young American beings who were guests like ourselves.
"All the guests were exceedingly merry and lively. "They were telling 'funny stories' in turn, and the laughter from these
stories of theirs lingered in the room like smoke on days when the wind is
south over the chimneys of the American factories where their sausages
called 'hot dogs' are prepared.
"As I am also fond of funny stories, my first evening in the city of Chicago passed very amusingly indeed. "It was all quite sensible and pleasant, except for one feature common to all the stories told that evening, which greatly astonished and perplexed me "What astonished me was their 'ambiguity' and 'obscenity.'



"The ambiguity and obscenity of these stories were such that any one of these young American storytellers could have given a dozen points to their famous 'Boccaccio. ' "Boccaccio is the name of a certain writer who wrote for the beings of the Earth a very instructive book called the Decameron, which at the present time is very widely read and is the favorite book of the beings belonging to almost all the communities there. "The following evening this kind Mr Bellybutton took me to see some other friends of his. "Here, too, were quite a number of young American beings both male and female, sitting in various corners of a large room talking quietly with each other. "As soon as we were seated, a pretty young American girl came and sat
down beside me, and began chatting with me.
"As is usually done there, I took up the conversation, and we chatted about anything and everything. She asked me among other things many questions about the city of Paris. "In the middle of the conversation, this 'young lady' suddenly, without rhyme or reason, began stroking my neck. "I immediately thought, 'How kind of her! She must have noticed a "flea"
on my neck and is stroking the place to relieve the irritation.
"But when I noticed soon after that all the young American beings present were also stroking each other, I was very astonished and could not understand what it was all about. "My first supposition about fleas no longer held good, because it was
impossible to assume that everybody had a flea on his neck.
"I began speculating about the meaning of all this, but try as I might, I
could not find any explanation whatever.
"Afterward when we left the house and were in the street, I asked Mr Bellybutton to explain what had been going on. He immediately burst into unrestrained laughter, and called



me a 'simpleton' and a 'hick. ' Then, calming down a bit, he said:
'What a queer guy you are, why, we have just been to a "petting party. " '
And still laughing at my naïveté, he explained that the evening before we had
also been to a party, but to a "story party," and tomorrow, he continued, 'I am
planning to take you to a "swimming party" where young people bathe
together, but of course in special bathing suits. '
"Then seeing the look of bewilderment still on my face, he added, 'But if
for some reason or other you don't like such "tame affairs," we can go to
others that are not open to everybody. We have lots of such "clubs" here and I
am a member of several of them.
" 'At these "private parties," we can if you like find something more "substantial." "But I did not take advantage of the kindness of this obliging and
exceedingly 'amiable' Mr Bellybutton, because the next morning I received a
telegram which made it necessary for me to return to New York.
At this point of his tales Beelzebub suddenly became thoughtful and, after a
rather lengthy pause, he sighed deeply and continued to speak thus:
"The next day, instead of taking the morning train as I had decided on
receiving the telegram, I put off my departure until the evening.
"As the reason for the postponement of my departure may be a good
illustration for you of the evil resulting from a certain invention of these
American beings that is widely spread over all the other continents, and is one
of the chief causes of the continuous so to say 'dwindling of the psyche' of all
the three-brained beings of your unfortunate planet, I shall tell you about it in
detail.
"This maleficent invention of the beings of America, which I now intend to explain to you, has been the cause



not only of the continuous 'dwindling,' at an accelerating tempo, of the psyche
of all the three-brained beings breeding on that unfortunate planet of yours,
but also of the complete destruction of that unique being-function, proper to
all three-brained beings, which until the last century still arose in their
presence spontaneously, and is everywhere called the 'sane instinct to sense
the truth at the heart of reality. '
"In the place of this function, indispensable for every three-brained being,
there has gradually been crystallized another special function, whose action
induces in them a constant doubt about everything.
"This pernicious invention of theirs they call 'advertising. ' "So that you may understand what follows, I must tell you that several
years before my trip to America, during my travels on the continent of
Europe, I once bought some books to while away the long hours of a tedious
railway Journey In one of these books, by a very famous writer, I read a
chapter about America in which a great deal was said about what are called
the 'slaughterhouses' in that same city of Chicago.
'Slaughterhouse' is the name for a special place where terrestrial three
brained beings carry on the destruction of the existence of beings of various
other forms, whose planetary bodies they are addicted to consuming for their
first being-food, again owing to those abnormally established conditions of
ordinary being-existence.
"Moreover, when they carry out this manifestation of theirs in these
special establishments, they say and even imagine that they are doing it from
'necessity' and in what they call a perfectly 'humane' way.
"This famous contemporary writer gave a rapturous 'eyewitness' account
of one of the slaughterhouses of this same city of Chicago, in his opinion
superlatively well organized.
"He praised the perfection of its machines of all possible



kinds, and went into ecstasies over its marvelous cleanliness 'Not only,' he
wrote, 'does humaneness toward beings of other forms reach "divine"
proportions in this slaughterhouse, but the machines are perfected to such a
point that it is almost as if by driving a live ox through a door at one end,
some ten minutes later out of a door at the other end you get, if you wish, hot
sausages ready to eat ' Finally, he emphasized that this was all done entirely
by these perfected machines, untouched by human hands, as a consequence of
which everything was so clean and neat there that nothing could possibly be
cleaner or neater.
"Several years after having read that book, I happened upon an article in a
certain serious Russian magazine, in which these Chicago slaughterhouses
were lauded in the same terms.
"And thereafter, I heard of these Chicago slaughterhouses from a thousand
different beings, many of whom had presumably been eyewitnesses to the
wonders they described.
"In short, before my arrival in the city of Chicago, I was already fully
convinced that a 'marvel' unprecedented on the Earth existed there
"I must say that I had always been greatly interested in these
establishments where your favorites destroy the existence of various other
forms of terrestrial beings, and furthermore, from the time when I installed
and had to deal with various mechanical devices in my observatory on the
planet Mars, I always took a great interest in every sort of machine.
"Accordingly, as I happened to be in this same city of Chicago, I thought it
would be inexcusable on my part not to take the opportunity to see these
famous slaughterhouses So, on the morning of my departure, in the company
of one of my new Chicago acquaintances, I decided to take a look at one of
these rare constructions of your favorites.
"On the advice of an assistant of the chief director, we



took as our guide an employee of a branch of some bank that was connected with this slaughterhouse, and set off with him on a tour of inspection. "First of all we went through the yards into which the unfortunate
quadruped beings are driven and where they are kept until they are
slaughtered.
"These yards were no different from those of other establishments of the
same kind on your planet, except that they were on a considerably larger
scale On the other hand, they were much dirtier than any I had seen in other
countries.
"Afterward we went through several what are called 'annexes.' One of
them was the cold storage for the meat that was ready, in another they
destroyed the existence of quadruped beings simply with sledgehammers, and
also skinned them—exactly as is done in other slaughterhouses.
"By the way, in passing through this last annex it occurred to me that this
was probably the place where they slaughtered cattle intended especially for
the Jews, who, as I already knew, were obliged by the code of their religion
to destroy quadruped beings in a special way.
"Walking through all these annexes took rather a long time, and I kept
waiting for the moment when we would finally reach the section I had heard
so much about, and which I was determined to see.
"But when I told our guide that I wished to hurry on to that section, I
learned that we had already seen everything there was to be seen in this
famous Chicago slaughterhouse, and that there were no other sections.
"Nowhere, my dear boy, had I laid eyes on a single machine, with the exception of the rollers on rails which all slaughterhouses use for moving the heavy carcasses, and as for the filth in this Chicago slaughterhouse, I had seen more than enough. "In cleanliness and general organization, the slaughterhouse of the city of Tiflis, which I had seen two years before,



could have given many points to this slaughterhouse of the city of Chicago.
"In Tiflis, for example, you would not find anywhere on the floor a single
drop of blood, whereas in Chicago, everywhere, at every step, there were
pools of it.
"Obviously some group of American businessmen, resorting as always to
their inveterate 'advertising,' had decided to advertise these Chicago
slaughterhouses also, in order to spread a false notion of them over the whole
planet, totally unrelated to reality.
"As is the general rule there, in this case also they certainly did not spare
their dollars And since the sacred being-function of conscience is completely
atrophied among contemporary terrestrial journalists and reporters, they have
succeeded in crystallizing, in almost all your favorites breeding on all the
continents, a monstrously exaggerated notion of the slaughterhouses of
Chicago.
"And it can indeed be said that this was done in 'true American fashion. '
"On the continent of America, the three-brained beings have become so
expert in this advertising of theirs that one could apply to them the following
saying of our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin.
'Only he will become a friend of the cloven-hoofed who perfects himself
to such a high degree of Reason and being that he can make an elephant out
of a fly. '
"Indeed, they have become so skillful at 'making elephants out of flies,'
and they do it so often, that at the present time if one meets a genuine
American elephant, one has 'to remember oneself with the whole of one's
being' not to get the impression that it is only a fly.
"From Chicago I returned to the city of New York and, as I had accomplished
rapidly and rather satisfactorily all the projects for which I had come to this
continent, and, as the



surrounding circumstances and conditions of ordinary existence seemed to
correspond to my need for the periodic complete rest that had become
customary for me during this last personal sojourn of mine on the surface of
your planet, I decided to prolong my stay in this city and exist with the beings
there merely according to the being-associations inevitably flowing in me.
"Existing in this way in the chief center of this large contemporary
community and rubbing shoulders on many occasions with the beings there of
various types, I became aware one day—without any premeditation but
thanks only to my acquired habit of collecting material, as it were 'by the
way,' for those statistics of mine comparing the prevalence of being-illnesses
and strange 'subjective vices' among beings of different groups—of a fact that
greatly interested me, namely, that in the common presence of almost half the
three-brained beings I met there, the function that serves for the
transformation of the first being-food is disharmonized or, as they would say,
their 'digestive systems are spoiled', and that almost a quarter of them have, or
are candidates for having, that form of disease specific to beings there which
they call 'impotence,' thanks to which disease, a great many of the
contemporary beings of your planet are deprived forever of the possibility of
continuing their species.
"When I chanced to become aware of this, a great interest in the beings of
this new group arose in me, so that I changed my previously determined mode
of existence and allotted half the time set aside for my personal rest to special
observation and investigation of the causes of this fact—so strange for me and
so deplorable for them In pursuit of this aim I even went to various provincial
centers of this great new contemporary community, though I stayed nowhere
longer than one or two days, except in the city of 'Boston' or, as it is
sometimes called, the 'city of those who escaped the



degeneration of nations ' There I existed for a whole week. "The results of these observations and statistical investigations of mine
made it clear that both these diseases, which are prevalent to a certain extent
among the contemporary beings who breed on all the continents, are on this
continent so inordinately widespread that their consequences were im
mediately plain to me I even thought that if things go on in this way, the same
fate will soon befall this large independent group of the three-brained beings
who have taken your fancy as recently befell that large community which was
called 'monarchic Russia,' that is to say, this group in its turn will also be
destroyed.
"The only difference will be in the process of the destruction itself The
process of destruction of the large community of 'monarchic Russia' took
place on account of the abnormalities of the Reason of the 'power-possessing
beings' there, whereas the process of destruction of this community of
America will take place on account of organic abnormalities.
"In other words, the 'death' of the first community came, as they say, from
the mind, whereas the death of the second will come from the stomach and
sex of its beings.
"It has been known since ancient times that, in general, the possibility of
long existence for a three-brained being of your planet depends exclusively on
the normal working of these two being-functions, that is, upon the state of
their digestion and upon the functioning of their sex organs.
"And it is precisely these two functionings indispensable to their common
presence which are now regressing in the direction of complete atrophy—and
moreover, at a highly accelerated pace.
"This community of America is still quite young, it is still, as they say on
your planet, like an infant, all 'peaches and cream.'
"And since in the beings of such a young community



these two chief motors of their existence are already tending toward
regression, I think that here also, as generally takes place with everything in
the Megalocosmos, the further movement toward blending again with the
Infinite will depend on the direction and intensity of the forces generated by
the initial impetus.
"In our Great Megalocosmos, it is even considered a law for all beings with
Reason that one must always and in everything guard against the initial
impetus, because on acquiring momentum, it becomes a force which is the
fundamental mover of everything existing in the Universe, leading everything
back to Prime Being. "
Just then Beelzebub was handed a "leitoochanbros," and when he had finished
listening to its contents he turned again to Hassein and said:
"I think, my boy, that you will be able to have a clearer representation and
understanding of the strangeness of the psyche of these three-brained beings
who please you and who arise on the planet Earth, if I explain to you in some
what greater detail the causes of the disharmony in both these fundamental
functionings in the common presence of these American three-brained beings.
"For convenience of exposition I shall explain separately the causes of the
disharmony in each of these fundamental functionings, and I shall begin with
the causes of the disharmony in the functioning of the transformation of their
'first being-food' or, as they themselves would say, the 'causes of the spoiling
of their stomachs.'
"The disharmony of this functioning has several specific causes,
comprehensible even to the normal Reason of ordinary three-brained beings,
but the most important is that from the very beginning of the formation of their
community, they gradually got accustomed—owing to all kinds of
surrounding conditions and influences, proceeding from



an authority abnormally established by itself—never to consume as their first
being-food anything fresh whatsoever, but to make use exclusively of
products that are already in a state of decomposition.
"At the present time, the beings of this group almost never consume for
their first being-food any edible product which still retains all those 'active
elements' put into it by Great Nature herself, and which are indispensable
requisites for the normal existence of all beings, but they 'preserve,' 'freeze,'
and 'essencify' beforehand all these products of theirs and only use them when
most of the 'active elements' required for normal existence have already been
volatilized out of them.
"And this abnormality appeared in the ordinary process of being-existence
of the three-brained beings of this new group, and continues to spread and to
be fixed everywhere among your favorites, owing to the fact that when the
three-brained beings of your planet ceased to actualize the being-efforts
indispensable for them, they gradually lost the possibility of crystallizing in
their common presence those being-data which would enable them—even in
the absence of guidance from any true directing knowledge—to sense
instinctively the harmfulness for themselves of one or another of their
manifestations.
"And if only a few of these unfortunate Americans possessed this instinct
proper to three-brained beings, they could—thanks merely to accidental
being-associations and confrontations—first become aware themselves, and
later inform all the others, that as soon as the prime connection between any
product used as 'first being-food' and Great Nature is severed, then even if this
product is kept completely isolated, that is to say, 'hermetically sealed,'
'frozen,' or 'essencified,' it must, like everything else in the Universe, solely by
the action of time, change and decompose accord



ing to the same principle and in the same order in which it was formed.
"In this connection you should know that the active elements from which
all cosmic formations are constituted by Nature—both those subject to
transformation through the tetartocosmoses in the products used for the first
food of beings, and also those from which all other completely spiritualized
and half-spiritualized arisings are formed—are obliged, as soon as the
corresponding time arrives, in whatever conditions they may be found, to
separate in a certain order from those masses in which they were fused during
the trogoautoegocratic process.
"And the same, of course, is true of those products, so dear to the
American beings, which they preserve in what are called 'hermetically sealed
cans.'
"No matter how hermetically these cans of products may be sealed, as soon
as the time of 'disintegration' arrives, the constituent 'active elements'
infallibly begin to separate from the whole mass And these active elements,
thus separated from the whole mass, usually group themselves according to
their origin, either in the form of 'drops' or of small 'bubbles' that 'dissolve'
instantly when the cans are opened for the consumption of these products and,
volatilizing into space, are dispersed to their corresponding places.
"Of course, the beings of this continent do sometimes consume fresh fruits.
But these fruits of theirs can hardly be called fruits, they are simply, as our
dear teacher would say, 'freaks.'
"Thanks to their wiseacring with the fruit trees that exist in abundance on
this continent, various 'scientists of new formation' have succeeded little by
little in making these American fruits at the present time just a 'feast for the
eye,' and no longer a form of being-nourishment.
"The fruits there have been cultivated in such a way that



by the time they are ripe they contain scarcely anything destined by Great Nature for consumption by beings for their normal being-existence. "These scientists of new formation are, of course, very far from suspecting that, when any surplanetary formation is artificially grafted or manipulated in any such fashion, it is reduced to a state defined by Objective Science as 'absoizomosa,' in which it absorbs from its surrounding medium cosmic substances useful only for the coating of what is called its 'automatically reproducing subjective presence.' "Indeed, from the very beginning of this most recent contemporary civilization of theirs, it somehow happened that the beings of all the innumerable separate groups there adopted only one of the seven aspects of the fundamental commandment given to three-brained beings from Above, namely, 'to strive to acquire inner and outer purity', and this single aspect, which in a distorted form they made their ideal, is conveyed in the following words: " 'Help everything around you, both the animate and inanimate, to acquire a beautiful appearance. ' "Especially in the last two centuries there, they have striven to achieve this 'beautiful appearance'—but of course, only for those various external objects which in the given period chanced to become, as they expressed it, 'fashionable. ' "During this period, it has been of no concern to them whether any external object had any substance whatsoever in itself—what was important was that it should have what they call a 'striking appearance. ' "I must say, my boy, as regards the achievements of the contemporary beings of this continent in enhancing the 'external beauty' of these fruits of theirs, that nowhere on the other continents of the same planet or even on the other planets of that solar system have I seen fruits so beautiful in appearance as that of the present time on this continent of



America, on the other hand, as regards the inner substance of this fruit, one can only have recourse to that favorite expression of our dear teacher: " 'The greatest of all blessings for man is the action of castor oil. '
"And to what heights they have earned their skill in making their famous
preserves out of these fruits—'neither tongue can tell nor pen describe ' You
have to see them for yourself to experience in your common presence the
degree of 'rapture' to which you are carried at the sight of the external beauty
of these American fruit preserves.
"Walking down the main streets of the cities of this continent, especially
the city of New York, and seeing the display in any fruit store, it is hard to say
at once just what it is your eyes behold is it an exhibition of paintings by 'fu
turists' of the city of Berlin on the continent of Europe, or is it a display in the
famous perfumery shops for foreigners in the 'world capital,' the city of Paris?
"Only after a while, when you have finally managed to take in the
decorative details of these displays and somehow come to your senses again,
can you clearly recognize how much greater variety there is in the color and
shape of the 'jars' and 'bottles' in these American displays of fruit preserves
than in the displays on the continent of Europe And this variety of color and
shape is evidently due to the fact that, in the common psyche of the beings of
this new group, the combination, resulting from the mixture of formerly
independent races, happens to correspond more completely to a better
perception and wider understanding of the meaning of the prodigious benefits
produced by the Reason both of the beings of the contemporary community of
Germany with respect to the chemical substances they have invented, called
'aniline' and 'alizarin,' and of the beings of the community of France as
regards 'perfumery.'
"When I myself first saw one of these displays I could not



refrain from entering the shop and buying about forty jars of all shapes, containing fruit preserves of every shade of color. "I bought them to please the beings who accompanied me, and who came
from the continents of Asia and Europe, where such strikingly beautiful fruit
did not as yet exist And indeed, when I brought my purchases home and dis
tributed them, these beings were, at first, no less astonished and delighted by
their appearance than I had been, but when they consumed them for their first
being-food, all I needed was to see them wince and change color to
understand the effect of these fruits upon the organism of beings.
"The situation is still worse on that continent as regards the product which
for them as well as for almost all three-brained beings of the Universe is the
most important first being-food, that is, the product called 'prosphora,' which
they themselves name 'bread.'
"Before describing the fate of this American bread, I must tell you that this
part of the terra firma of your planet called 'North and South America' was
formed—as a result of various accidental combinations ensuing, on the one
hand, from the second great 'cataclysm not according to law' which befell that
ill-fated planet, and on the other hand, from the position occupied by this terra
firma in the process of the 'common system movement'—with a layer of what
is called 'soil' that was and still is very suitable for the production of that
'divine grain' of which 'prosphora' is made The soil surface of these
continents, if utilized consciously, is capable of yielding in a single what is
called 'good season' the fullness of one complete process of the sacred
Heptaparaparshinokh, in other words, a 'forty-nine-fold' harvest, and even by
a semiconscious use of the soil, as is now the case, the yield of this 'divine
grain' is considerably more abundant than on the other continents.
"Well then, my boy, when the beings of that continent,



thanks to various fortuitous circumstances, had become the happy possessors
of large amounts of what have become for the strange psyche of your
contemporary favorites the objects of their dreams and which everywhere are
called 'dollars,' then, as is usual for them, in the 'being-picturings' of the
beings of all other continents they acquired what is called 'a sense of
superiority', and as a result of this, as is also usual for them, they began to
wiseacre to achieve that contemporary ideal I spoke of—and they also
wiseacred with all their might with this divine gram from which 'prosphora' is
made.
"They employed every possible means to, so to say, 'deform' this divine
gram in order to give its product a 'beautiful and striking appearance.'
"For this purpose they invented all sorts of machines by means of which
they 'scrape,' 'comb,' 'smooth,' and 'polish' this wheat that has the misfortune
to arise on their continent, until they bring about the complete destruction of
all those 'active elements' concentrated on the surface of the grain just
underneath what is called the 'husk,' and which are precisely what Great
Nature designed for renewing in the common presence of three-brained beings
what they have expended in worthily serving her.
"Hence it is, my boy, that the prosphora, or bread, made from the wheat
that arises in such abundance on this continent now contains nothing useful
for the beings who consume it, and from its consumption there is produced in
their presences nothing but noxious gases and what are called there 'intestinal
worms.'
"However, it must be remarked, in all fairness, that if they get nothing from
this wheat for serving Great Nature better or more consciously, at least, by
producing these worms in themselves, they unconsciously greatly assist their
planet in honorable service to the Most Great Common-Cosmic
Trogoautoegocrat For are not these worms also



beings, through whom cosmic substances are also transformed?
"At any rate, the beings breeding on this continent have already achieved,
by their wiseacrings with this bread, what they so greatly desired and strove
so earnestly to obtain, which is that the beings of all other continents should
never fail to say of them, as in this case, something like the following:
" 'Astonishingly smart fellows, these Americans! Even their bread is
extraordinary, so superb, so white, just marvelous—really the splendor of
splendors of modern civilization.
"But that this maltreatment of the wheat renders their bread 'worthless'
and, furthermore, constitutes another of the innumerable factors in the
spoiling of their stomachs— what does it matter to them? Are they not in the
front rank of what is called 'European civilization'?
"The most curious thing of all is that in their naïveté they give that which
is the best and most useful of what Nature has formed for their normal
existence in this divine grain to their pigs—or simply burn it, while they
themselves consume only that substance formed by Nature for connecting and
maintaining those same active elements which are localized chiefly, as I have
already said, just under the husk of the grain.
"Another rather important factor in the disharmonizing of the digestive
function of these unfortunate American three-brained beings is the system
they have recently invented for the elimination from themselves of the waste
residue of their first being-food, that is to say, the 'comfortable seats' of what
are called their 'water closets.'
"Not only is this maleficent invention still one of the chief factors in the
disharmony now proceeding in them, and in almost all the beings of other
continents—who, by the way, have recently begun to imitate them zealously
in all their



ingenious methods of 'assisting' their transformatory functioning—but it
provides your favorites, who are now striving once again to fulfill even this
inevitable being-function with the greatest possible sensation of pleasant
tranquility, with a new incentive for devoted service to their god, 'self
calming,' which, as I have already said more than once, was and still is the
principal evil engendering and evoking in them all the abnormalities of their
psyche as well as of their ordinary being-existence.
"A good example—as luminous as an 'American billboard'—for your
being-representation of the extraordinary perspectives opened for the future
by this invention of theirs is provided by the following certain of these
contemporary American beings who, of course by accident, have acquired a
large quantity of their famous dollars, now install beside their 'water closets
with comfortable seats' various accessories such as a small table, a telephone,
and what is called a 'radiographic apparatus,' so that while sitting there com
fortably, they may carry on their 'correspondence,' talk on the telephone with
their acquaintances about all their 'dollar businesses,' quietly read the
newspapers which have become indispensable to them, or finally, listen to the
musical compositions of various 'hasnamusses' which, as soon as they become
fashionable, every American 'businessman' is bound to know.
"The greatest evil of this American invention, from the standpoint of the
disharmony in the digestive functioning of all the contemporary three-brained
beings of your planet, is due to the following causes:
"In former times, when more or less normal data for engendering
Objective Reason were still crystallized in the common presence of your
favorites, and they could reflect for themselves, or at least understand when
other similar and already well-informed beings explained the subject to them,
they assumed the posture required for this function.



Later, when these being-data had definitely ceased to be crystallized in them,
and they began discharging this function only automatically, their planetary
body, thanks to the system prevalent before that American invention, could
automatically, simply by what is called 'animal instinct,' adopt the required
posture But now that American beings have invented these comfortable seats,
and they have all begun using them for this inevitable function of theirs, their
planetary body can no longer adapt itself even instinctively to the required
posture, with the consequence that certain muscles, which actualize this
inevitable being-function, have gradually become atrophied, and thus they
have become subject to what is called 'constipation' and, in addition, to
several specific new diseases, which in the whole of our Great Universe arise
exclusively in the presence of these strange three-brained beings.
"Among the various primary and secondary causes which, in their totality,
are gradually bringing about the disharmony of this fundamental function in
the common presence of your contemporary favorites breeding on the
continent of North America, there is an exceedingly peculiar one that is 'bla
tantly obvious,' but which, thanks to their 'chicken-brained understanding,'
thrives with an impulse of egoistic satisfaction under, as it were, a 'cap of
invisibility. '
"This peculiar cause, which arose and began slowly and quietly, but
inexorably, to disharmonize this function in them, lies in the ruling passion of
the strange beings of this large group to go as often as possible to the
continent of Europe.
"You should be informed about this peculiar cause also, because you will
learn from it yet another result, harmful for all your favorites, of the 'evil
wiseacrings' of their contemporary 'scientists. '
"To have a clearer picture and understanding of this cause of disharmony
in the common presence of these American



beings, you should first become familiar with a certain detail of the organs
which actualize this indispensable function of digestion.
"Among the organs serving the complete transformation of the first being
food is one that exists almost everywhere under the name of 'toospooshokh'
or, as they call it in their scientific terminology, 'appendix.'
"The function of this organ, as designed by Great Nature, consists in
storing up, in the form of what are called 'gases,' various connective cosmic
substances, separated through the transformation of the various surplanetary
crystallizations which compose the first being-food, so that later these gases
by their pressure may help the act of elimination of the waste residue of this
food.
"The gases accumulated in this organ produce, by their so to say
'discharge,' the mechanical action foreseen by Nature; and they do this
independently of the general process of transformation in beings, and only at
certain definite times according to the subjective habit of each being.
"Well then, my boy, thanks to their frequent voyages to the continent of
Europe—the round trip taking from twelve days to a month—conditions are
created involving a daily change of time for the fulfillment of this established
function, resulting in a serious factor for progressive disharmony in the
general process of transformation in them. That is to say, when on account of
the change of their established time they go for a period of several days
without performing this indispensable function of theirs, the 'gases' collected
in this organ, not being utilized for the intended purpose, and not fulfilling the
design preconceived by Great Nature, gradually escape from their presences
unproductively into space—the totality of these manifestations, by the way,
making existence on these passenger ships of theirs almost intolerable for a
being with a normally developed organ for perceiving odors And so, as a
result of all this, they often suffer 'con



stipation,' which in its turn also leads to the progressive disharmony of this vital transforming function. "Well, my boy, when explaining the causes of the disharmony of the
function of transformation of the first being-food in the presences of these
American beings, and when I mentioned the 'comfortable seats' they invented,
I said among other things that your favorites of the planet Earth were 'once
again' striving to perform this indispensable being-function with the greatest
possible sensation of self-satisfaction I said 'once again' because in various
periods of the flow of time these strange three-brained beings who have taken
your fancy had introduced something similar into the usages of their ordinary
existence.
"I remember very clearly one of those periods when the beings of that
time—who by the way, according to the notions of your contemporary
favorites, were nothing but 'savages'—invented every possible kind of
convenience for performing this same prosaic yet indispensable being-need,
for which these contemporary Americans, who imagine in their naïveté that
they have already attained the 'pinnacle of civilization,' have invented these
comfortable seats for their 'water closets.'
"This happened during the period when the chief center of culture for the whole of your planet was the country of Tikliamish, which was then at the height of its splendor. "For this being-function, the beings of the country of Tikliamish invented
something rather like these American comfortable seats, and this maleficent
invention spread no less widely throughout the other countries inhabited by
the three-brained beings of that ill-fated planet.
"If the invention of the beings of the Tikliamishian civilization were
compared with that of these contemporary Americans, then, according to the
expression they sometimes use for comparison, the latter might be called
'child's play. '



"The beings of the Tikliamishian civilization invented a sort of
'comfortable couch bed' which could be used for sleeping as well as for what
is called 'lounging,' so that while lying on this wonderful contrivance, without
manifesting the slightest being-effort whatever, they could perform this
inevitable being-need for which the contemporary beings of the continent of
America have invented their 'seats of ease.'
"These 'wonder beds' were so adapted for this purpose that a lever by the
side of the bed had only to be touched lightly to enable one instantly, in the
bed itself, to perform this same indispensable need 'freely,' of course very
'costly' and also with the 'greatest chic. '
"It will not be superfluous, my boy, for you to know, by the way, that these
famous beds were the cause of great and momentous events in the process of
their ordinary existence.
"As long as the previous relatively normal system for this being-function
still prevailed among the beings there, everything had gone along very
peacefully and quietly, but as soon as certain 'power-possessing and wealth
possessing beings' of that time had invented these famous 'comfortable beds'
which came to be called 'if you wish to enjoy felicity, then enjoy it with a
bang,' those events began among the ordinary beings of that time which led to
the serious and deplorable consequences I have mentioned.
"I must tell you that it was just during those years when the beings of
Tikliamish were inventing these 'wonder beds' that this planet of yours
underwent the common-cosmic process of 'chirnooanovo,' that is to say, in
order to conform with a displacement of the center of gravity of this solar
system in the movement of the general common-cosmic harmony, the center
of gravity of this planet itself was also displaced.
"During such periods, as you already know, in the psyche of the beings inhabiting any planet undergoing 'chirnooanovo-novo,' there is an increase of the 'blagonooarirnian sensation'



or, as it is otherwise called, 'remorse of conscience' for one's past deeds contrary to one's own convictions. "But on your planet, the common presence of your favorites has become so
odd—from a variety of causes, some accidental and others of their own
making—that the resulting action of this common-cosmic actualization does
not proceed as it does in the presence of the three-brained beings arising on
other planets, that is to say, instead of this 'remorse of conscience,' there
usually arise and become widely propagated certain specific processes, called
the 'reciprocal destruction of microcosmoses in the tetartocosmos'—processes
which they look upon as epidemics and which in ancient times were known by
the names of 'kaliunium,' 'morkrokh,' 'selnoano,' and so on, and today by the
names of 'black death,' 'cholera,' 'Spanish influenza,' and so on.
"Well then, since many of these diseases then known as 'kolbana,'
'tirdiank,' 'moyasul,' 'champarnakh,' and so on, and called by contemporary
beings 'tabes dorsalis,' 'sclerosis disseminata,' 'hemorrhoids,' 'sciatica,'
'hemiplegia,' and so on, were widely spread among the majority of those using
these exceedingly 'comfortable couch beds,' certain beings in Tikliamish—in
whose common presences, due to the complete absence of the actualization of
being-partkdolgduty, the data for hasnamussian properties had begun to be
crystallized more intensively than usual, and among whom were those called
'revolutionaries'—observed this fact and decided to take advantage of it for
their own purposes So the beings of this type invented and broadcast among
the other beings of that time the idea that all these epidemic diseases stemmed
from the 'parasitic bourgeois,' who in using these beds, 'if you wish to enjoy
felicity, then enjoy it with a mighty bang,' contracted various diseases, which
later spread by contagion among the masses.
"Thanks to their peculiar inherency called 'suggestibility,'



which I mentioned before, all the beings around them of course believed this
'propaganda' of theirs and, after much talk about it, as is usual in such cases,
there gradually crystallized in each of them the periodically arising factor
which causes in their common psyche that strange and relatively prolonged
psychic state that I would call the 'loss of sensation of self ' In consequence of
this, as also usually happens there, they set about destroying not only all these
'wonder-beds' but also the existence of the beings who used them.
"Although this crisis soon lost its intensity in the presences of most of the
ordinary beings of that period, the 'raging destruction' both of these beds and
of the beings who used them continued by momentum for several terrestrial
years Finally, this maleficent invention went completely out of use, and it was
soon forgotten that such beds had ever existed on the planet.
"At any rate, it can be said with certainty that if the 'civilization' of the
beings of the group now breeding on the continent of America continues to
develop in the same spirit and at its present rate, they also will unquestionably
civilize themselves to the degree of having 'couch-beds' as astonishing as were
those beds called 'if you wish to enjoy felicity, enjoy it with a bang.
"And now, my boy, by way of illustration, it will not be amiss to give you a
few examples related to the invention of preserved products for the first being
food and their use in the process of being-existence by the beings of this con
temporary group, who in recent times have chanced to become 'models' for the
strange Reason of the beings of all the other continents, merely because they
are assumed to be the first on their planet to have invented such beneficent
and convenient being-usages—in this instance, the method of using preserved
products for food, thanks to which they so to say 'save time.'



"The unfortunate contemporary three-brained beings who breed on your
planet are of course not aware nor can they even suspect that their remote
ancestors, who were much more normally formed as responsible beings, had
at different times 'racked their brains,' as is said, not a little, to discover some
practical means for reducing the time spent on the inevitable being-necessity
to feed themselves But each time they discovered an apparently expedient
method they became convinced, after a brief trial, that these products, of
whatever kind and however they might be preserved, always deteriorated with
time and became worthless for their first being-food, and hence they ceased to
employ these methods in the process of their ordinary existence.
"In comparison with the contemporary method of preserving products for
one's first being-food, let us take the example of a method I personally
witnessed in the country of Maralpleicie.
"It was just at the time when the beings of the region of Maralpleicie were
'competing' in everything with the beings of the country of Tikliamish and
were engaged in a fierce rivalry to make the beings of all other countries
regard their country as the 'foremost center of culture.'
"And it was precisely with this aim that they invented, among other things,
something similar to these American preserves.
"The beings of Maralpleicie, however, preserved their edible products not
in 'poison-exuding' tin cans, such as are used by the contemporary beings of
the continent of America, but in what were then called 'sikharenionian' vessels.
"Those 'sikharenionian' vessels in Maralpleicie were made out of very
finely ground 'mother-of-pearl,' as it is called there, yolks of hens' eggs, and a
glue obtained from a fish named the 'Choozna sturgeon. '
"These vessels had the appearance and quality of the unpolished glass jars now existing on your planet.



"In spite of all the obvious advantages of preserving products in such
vessels, certain beings with good sense, existing in the country of
Maralpleicie, observed that, in beings who habitually used products preserved
in this way, what is called 'organic shame' was progressively atrophied, so, as
soon as they had succeeded in spreading the information about this discovery
of theirs, all the beings around them ceased to employ this method, and
eventually it was dropped so completely from common use that the
knowledge that such a method had ever existed failed to reach even the fifth
or sixth generation after them.
"On this continent of Asia various methods of preserving edible products
have existed throughout the ages, and several of these are used even now,
having come down to contemporary beings from their remote ancestors.
"But of all these methods not one was so harmful to beings as this method
invented by the contemporary beings of America, with their poison-exuding
tin cans.
"This principle of preserving products in 'hermetically sealed' vessels to
prevent exposure to the atmosphere and thus, as it were, avoid the process of
decomposition, is well known to certain contemporary Asiatic groups, but
they never have recourse for this purpose to these American tin cans.
"On the continent of Asia, they only use what is called 'koordiook' fat for
this purpose.
'Koordiook' fat is a substance that accumulates in great quantity around
the tail of a certain form of two-brained quadruped being named 'sheep,'
breeding everywhere on the continent of Asia.
"This sheep's-tail fat contains no cosmic crystallizations harmful to the
common presence of three-brained beings, and is itself one of the chief
products used for their first being-food on the continent of Asia But the
metals of which the contemporary beings of the continent of America make



the cans for the preservation of their products—however completely the inner
surface may be isolated from the influence of the atmosphere—after a definite
time exude certain of their active elements, some of which are, as they say,
very 'poisonous' for the common presence of beings in general.
"These poisonous active elements that issue from tin or similar metals,
remaining in hermetically closed cans, are unable to volatilize into space And
meeting certain elements in the products in these cans that correspond to them
by 'kinship of class,' determined by the number of vibrations, these active
elements combine with them according to the cosmic 'law of fusion', and later
of course these combined elements enter the organism of the beings who
consume these products.
"Not content with preserving their products in these 'poison-exuding' tin
cans, which are so harmful for them, your contemporary favorites of the
continent of America moreover prefer to preserve them in the raw state.
"The beings of the continent of Asia, on the contrary, preserve all their
food products roasted or boiled, according to the custom that reached them
from their remote ancestors, because products preserved in this way do not
decompose as rapidly as when raw.
"And the reason is that when a product is boiled or roasted, there is
induced an artificial 'chemical fusion' of certain active elements among those
constituting its fundamental mass, whereby many active elements useful for
beings can remain in the products for a comparatively long time.
"Again I advise you to become more thoroughly acquainted with all the
kinds of 'chemical and mechanical fusions' proceeding in the Megalocosmos.
"Knowledge of this cosmic law will greatly help you to represent to
yourself and understand why and how such



numerous and varied formations are in general produced in Nature.
"And how a permanent fusion of the active elements in the interior of
products is obtained by boiling or roasting them, you will understand clearly if
you can represent to yourself the process that occurs during the artificial
preparation of 'prosphora.'
"Prosphora, or bread, is generally made everywhere by beings who are
aware of its sacred significance Only your contemporary favorites prepare it
without any consciousness of what they do, merely as a practice automatically
transmitted to them by inheritance.
"In this bread the crystallization of cosmic substances proceeds, as always,
in accordance with the Law of Triamazikamno, whose three holy forces are
represented by substances from three relatively independent sources, namely
the Holy Affirming, or active principle, is represented by the totality of
cosmic substances composing what your favorites call 'water', the Holy
Denying, or passive principle, by the totality of substances composing what
your favorites call 'flour,' obtained from the divine wheat grain, and the Holy
Reconciling, or neutralizing principle, by the substances obtained from
burning, or as your favorites say, from 'fire. '
"To clarify the idea I expressed about the significance of a permanent
fusion of cosmic substances from diverse sources, let us take as an example
that relatively independent totality of substances which serves as the active
principle in the formation of this 'prosphora,' or 'bread'—namely, the totality
which your favorites call 'water.'
"This relatively independent totality of cosmic substances called 'water' is
in itself, one might say, a 'natural mechanical mixture,' and can be preserved
only provided that it keeps its connection with Nature If the link between this
'water' and Nature is cut, that is, if a little of this water is taken out



of a river and kept separately in some receptacle, after a certain time the water
in this vessel inevitably begins, little by little, to be destroyed or, as is
otherwise said, to 'decompose', and this process usually has a very
malodorous effect on the perceptive organs of beings or, as your favorites
would say, this water soon begins 'to stink.'
"The same thing will take place with the mixture of this water with flour
Only a temporary mechanical mixture, or what is called 'dough,' will be
obtained, in which the water, after a relatively short time, will inevitably
decompose.
"But if this dough, namely, this mixture of water with flour, is baked over
fire, then thanks to the substances issuing from fire—which, as I have already
said, serve as the third holy neutralizing force of the sacred Law of
Triamazikamno—the result will be a 'chemical fusion,' or a 'permanent fusion
of substances,' whereby the new totality of substances obtained from the
water and flour, that is, the 'prosphora,' or 'bread,' will now resist the
merciless Hero-pass, and will not decompose for a much longer time.
"Bread made in this way can dry, crumble, or even to all appearances
completely disintegrate, yet the elements of water which have taken part in
this process of transformation will not be destroyed for rather a long time, but
will remain active among what are called the 'enduring prosphorian active
elements. '
"I repeat, my boy, that if the contemporary beings breeding on the
continent of Asia preserve their products exclusively in a roasted or boiled
state, and not raw, as the contemporary American beings prefer to do, this is
because these usages reached them from their ancestors, whose communities
had lasted for many centuries, and who therefore had a long practical
experience behind them, whereas the community of those American beings
was just, as our wise teacher would say, 'born yesterday. '
"In order that you may better evaluate the real significance



of this invention of the contemporary beings breeding on the continent of
America—an invention which is, as it were, the genuine outcome of
contemporary civilization—I do not consider it superfluous to inform you
also about the methods still employed by the beings of the continent of Asia
for preserving certain other products, for example, the method of preparing
what is called 'kovurma,' a favorite product of the beings of many groups on
the continent of Asia.
"This 'kovurma' is prepared on the continent of Asia very simply small
pieces of well-roasted meat are packed tightly into 'earthenware jars' or
'boordooks,' that is, specially treated goatskins.
"Melted sheep's-tail fat is then poured over these roasted pieces of meat.
"Although the pieces of roasted meat thus covered with fat will also
gradually spoil, for a relatively long period they do not become poisonous.
"The beings of the continent of Asia eat this 'kovurma' either cold or
heated up.
"When heated, it is as if the meat came from a freshly killed animal.
"Another favorite product, which can be preserved for a long time, is what
is called 'yaghli-yemish,' which is made of various fruits freshly picked and
strung on a cord in the form of a 'necklace' and thoroughly boiled in water,
these odd 'necklaces' are then cooled, and dipped several times in melted
sheep's-tail fat, after which they are hung up somewhere and allowed to dry in
an airy place.
"However long it hangs, fruit prepared in this way scarcely ever spoils, and when these odd 'necklaces' are to be used for food, they are dipped into hot water for a moment, whereupon all the fat melts off and entirely disappears, and the fruit itself has the same flavor as if it had been freshly picked from the tree.
"Even though fruit preserved like this differs very little



in taste from fresh fruit and will keep a long time, all those on the continent of
Asia who are more prosperous prefer fresh fruit.
"And they prefer fresh fruit obviously because, thanks to their inherited
capacities as direct descendants of the beings of long-standing ancient
communities, in most of them the crystallizing of data for the instinctive
sensing of reality proceeds more intensively than in most of your other
contemporary favorites.
"I repeat, my boy, that on your planet, the beings of past epochs, especially
those breeding on the continent of Asia, had attempted many times to use
various methods of preserving edible products, and it always ended in the
same way first certain persons, through their conscious or accidental
observations, discovered the harmful consequences of this practice both for
themselves and for those near them, then they communicated this to all the
other beings who, after making observations on themselves as impartially as
possible, also became convinced of the correctness of these deductions, and
ultimately, they all ceased to employ these practices in the process of their
existence.
"Still quite recently on this same continent of Asia, certain beings again
attempted not only to find a method to preserve edible products but were even
searching for some means for spending the least possible time on this
inevitable being-need of consuming the first being-food, and they discovered
what came close to being a very satisfactory method.
"I can describe to you in detail the interesting results of their investigations
in this domain, because I not only knew personally the terrestrial three-brained
being who, thanks to his conscious labors, discovered this method, but was
even present at several conclusive experiments he conducted on possible ways
of applying it to beings.
"His name was Asiman and he was a member of a group



of contemporary Asiatic three-brained beings who had recognized their slavish dependence upon certain causes within them, and had organized a collective existence for working on themselves to become free from this inner slavery. "It is interesting to note that this group of terrestrial three-brained beings, one of whom was this Brother Asiman, originally existed in the country formerly called 'Pearl-land,' and now called 'India', but when beings from the continent of Europe appeared there and began disturbing them and hindering their peaceful work, they all migrated across what are now called the 'Himalayan Mountains,' and settled partly in the country of Tibet and partly in what are called the 'valleys of the Hindu Kush. ' "Brother Asiman was one of the group that had settled in the valleys of the Hindu Kush. "As time was precious to the members of this brotherhood who were working for their self-perfection, and the process of eating robbed them of a great deal of time, Brother Asiman, being well versed in the science then called 'alchemy,' set to work very earnestly in the hope of finding what is called a 'chemical preparation,' the introduction of which into himself would make it possible for a being to exist without spending so many hours in preparing and consuming all sorts of products for his first being-food. "After long and intensive work, Brother Asiman found for this purpose a combination of chemical substances in the form of a 'powder,' one small 'thimbleful' of which, taken once every twenty-four hours, enabled a being to exist without consuming anything else but water, and to fulfill all his beingobligations satisfactorily. "When I chanced to visit this monastery where Brother Asiman existed with the other brethren of that small group of your contemporary favorites, they had all been using this preparation for five months, and Brother Asiman, with the



help of some of the other brethren who were also very familiar with this
substance, was intensely busy with experiments, this time on a large scale.
"And these experiments showed them that in the long run even this
preparation could not suffice for normal being-existence.
"After they had verified this, they not only entirely ceased using this
powder, but even destroyed the very formula for preparing it that Brother
Asiman had found.
"Several months later I happened to return to that monastery and to
acquaint myself with a document these brethren had composed on the very
day that they ceased once and for all to use this astonishing preparation.
"This document contained, among other things, several very interesting
details about the action produced by Asiman's preparation It stated that when
this preparation was introduced into the presence of a being, in addition to its
nutritive property, this substance had a particular effect upon what are called
the 'wandering nerves' of the stomach, which was that not only did the need
for food immediately cease in beings but the desire to consume any edible
product whatsoever also entirely disappeared And if one of them was obliged
to swallow something it took a long time for the resulting disagreeable state to
pass.
"This document also said that at first no change had been noticed in the
presences of the beings who took this preparation for their nourishment, even
their weight did not diminish It was only after five months that its harmful
effect became evident in the common presences of the beings by the
progressive weakening of the power and sensitivity of their perceptive organs
and certain of their manifestations For example, their voices grew weaker,
and their sight, hearing, and so on got worse Furthermore, in certain of them,
preceding the derangement of their being-functions, changes were observed in
their general psychic state.



"The document composed by these brethren gave a lengthy description of the changes of character in the beings after they had used Asiman's remarkable preparation for five months, and by way of illustration, some excellent and apt comparisons were included. "Although none of the specific examples that were cited in this document
have remained in my memory, I have retained the 'flavor' of them and can
give you their purport if I use once again the language of our respected
Mullah Nasr Eddin.
"For example, a brother with the character of, as they say, one of 'God's
angels' would suddenly become as irritable as someone of whom our dear
Mullah Nasr Eddin once said:
"He is as testy as a man who has just undergone the full treatment by a
famous European nerve specialist.'
"Or again, beings who one day were as placid as the little 'butter lambs'
that the pious place on the festal table at their most important religious feasts
would on the next day get as exasperated as a German professor when some
Frenchman, also a professor, discovers something new in contemporary
science.
"Or again, a being whose love was like that of a contemporary terrestrial
suitor for a rich widow—of course before he has received a single penny
from her—would turn just as spiteful as one of those venomous persons who,
foaming at the mouth, will hate that poor author who is now writing about
you and me in his book entitled An Objectively Impartial Criticism of the Life
of Man.
"This poor upstart author, by the way, will be hated by the 'full-blooded
materialists' and by the 'ninety-six-carat deists' and even by those of the three
brained beings who have taken your fancy who, as long as their stomachs are
full and their 'mistresses' are making no 'scenes,' are 'in



corrigible optimists' but who, on the contrary, when their stomachs are empty become 'hopeless pessimists.' "Now, my boy, that we have mentioned this 'queer upstart writer,' there is
nothing for it but to inform you here about the perplexity concerning him that
long ago arose in me, and that continues to increase with regard to a certain
naïveté of his.
"I must tell you that from the very beginning of his responsible existence,
he also became—whether by accident or by the will of fate I do not know—a
follower, and in fact a very devout follower, of our wise and esteemed Mullah
Nasr Eddin, and that furthermore, in the ordinary process of his being
existence, he has never missed the slightest opportunity to act according to the
unprecedentedly wise and inimitable sayings of our revered teacher But now,
according to the information that has reached me by etherogram, all of a
sudden he appears to be constantly violating one of the most serious and
practical counsels—certainly not accessible to everybody—which this teacher
above all teachers formulated thus:
'Ekh, brother' Here on Earth if you tell the truth you're a big fool, whereas if you cheat and he you are only a 'scoundrel,' though also a big one So better do nothing, and just recline on your couch and learn how to sing like the sparrow that has not yet been turned into an "American canary."
"Now, my boy, absorb attentively the information I shall give you about the causes of the progressive disharmony, in the presence of the contemporary beings of the continent of America, of their second fundamental beingfunction, namely, the function of sex. "The disharmony of this function is due to several causes of diverse
character, but the chief cause, in my opinion, is their negligence, 'rooted in
their essence and already a part of their nature,' in keeping their sex organs
clean.



"The care that they take of their faces and their use of what are called
'cosmetics'—just like the beings of the continent of Europe—are only equaled
by their neglect of their sex organs, whereas more or less conscious three
brained beings recognize the necessity of observing the utmost cleanliness in
respect to just these organs.
"These American beings cannot be entirely to blame, however, because in
this respect the beings of the continent of Europe are most at fault, due to the
customs they have adopted in the process of their ordinary being-existence.
"The point is that this recently arisen large contemporary group is almost
entirely formed from beings who came, and continue to come, from various
large and small groups populating the continent of Europe.
"Even if the majority of the three-brained beings now composing this new
community are not themselves emigrants, their fathers or grandfathers were,
and in emigrating to this continent of America, they brought with them all
their European customs, including those which led to this uncleanliness in
respect of their sex organs.
"So, my boy, when I tell you how the matter stands as regards the question
of sex among the Americans, bear in mind that everything I say also refers to
the beings of the continent of Europe.
"The results of this uncleanliness of the contemporary three-brained beings
of the planet Earth breeding on the continents of Europe and America are
clearly borne out by my statistics.
"Let us take for example what are called there 'venereal diseases ' These
diseases are so widespread on these two continents that at the present time you
can scarcely find a being who has not had one or another form of them.
"There is no harm in your knowing among other things a little more about those interesting and peculiar data in my statistics which indicate how much more widespread these



diseases are among the beings of the continents of America and Europe than
among those of the continent of Asia.
"Many of these 'venereal diseases' are entirely absent in the beings of the
old Asiatic communities, whereas among European and American beings,
they are almost epidemic.
"Let us take for example what is called 'clap,' or as terrestrial scientists call
it, 'gonorrhea ' On the continents of Europe and America almost all the beings
both of male and female sex have this disease in one or another of its different
phases, while on the continent of Asia it is met with only on the borders,
where beings frequently mingle with beings of the continent of Europe.
"The beings belonging to the community existing under the name of
'Persia' on the continent of Asia can serve as a good illustration of what has
just been said.
"Among the beings dwelling in the central, eastern, southern, and western
areas of this relatively large territory, these diseases are not to be found at all.
"But in the northern part, especially in the region called 'Azerbaijan,' which
is in direct contact with the large half-European, half-Asiatic community of
Russia, the percentage of beings infected with this disease increases in
proportion to their proximity to this Russia.
"And exactly the same is true in other eastern countries of the continent of
Asia The incidence of this disease is in proportion to the amount of contact
between the beings of these countries and those of the continent of Europe In
India, for example, and in parts of China, this disease has recently become
widespread, chiefly in those places where they come into contact with
European beings of the community of England.
"Thus it is safe to say that the chief disseminators of this disease among the
beings of the continent of Asia are, on the northwest, the beings of the large
community of Russia, and on the east, those of the community of England.



"The reason why this disease, as well as many other evils, does not exist in
the rest of the continent of Asia is, in my opinion, that most of the beings of
this continent have retained several very good customs for their daily
existence, which have reached them from their remote ancestors.
"These customs are so deeply implanted by their religion in their everyday
existence that, by observing them mechanically without any wiseacring,
beings are more or less protected from certain evils which, owing to the
abnormally established conditions of existence, have arisen and continue to
arise in incalculable numbers on that ill-fated planet.
"The beings of most of the groups on the continent of Asia are safeguarded
against many venereal diseases, as well as against many other 'sexual
abnormalities,' if only by the customs known there by the names of 'sooniat'
and 'abdast. '
"The first of these customs, namely 'sooniat' or, as it is otherwise called,
'circumcision,' not only saves most of the Asiatic beings of responsible age
from numerous venereal diseases, but also safeguards most of the children
'and youths against that 'scourge' known on Earth under the name of
'onanism,' which wreaks such havoc among the young people of the
continents of Europe and America.
"According to this custom, the 'adult' beings of almost all the
contemporary groups of the continent of Asia perform on their 'results,' that is
to say, on their male children, at a certain age, a ritual which consists in
cutting what they call the 'frenum' and the 'prepuce' of the penis.
"Today, the children of those contemporary terrestrial beings who are
automatically subject to this practice are almost completely safeguarded
against the inevitable consequences of certain evils, already definitely fixed in
the process of existence of your favorites.
"For example, according to my statistics, the 'scourge' I spoke of, that is,
'children's onanism,' is scarcely met with among those who observe this
custom of 'circumcision,'



whereas the young beings who fail to observe this custom are, without exception, susceptible to this sexual abnormality. "The second custom I mentioned, that of 'abdast,' which by the way is given different names by the beings of different groups on the continent of Asia, is nothing but the obligatory ablution of the sex organs after each visit to what is called the 'water closet. ' "Thanks chiefly to this second custom, most of your favorites breeding on the continent of Asia are free of many 'venereal diseases' and other 'sexual abnormalities. ' "
Having said this, Beelzebub became thoughtful, and after a long pause said: "The theme of our present talk reminds me of a certain interesting
conversation I had, during my sojourn in France, with a young and most
congenial three-brained being.
"I think, perhaps, it will be best for your understanding of everything that has just been said if I repeat that conversation to you in full, the more so as, besides explaining the meaning of the custom of 'abdast,' or 'ablution,' it will enlighten you on many other questions relating to the peculiar psyche of these favorites of yours. "The being with whom I had this conversation was that young Persian
who, you remember, at the request of our mutual acquaintances, was my
'guide' in the city of Paris, where I happened to be just before my departure
for the continent of America.
"One day I was waiting for this young Persian on the terrace of the famous Grand Café in the city of Paris. "As soon as he arrived, I saw from his eyes that he was, as they say there, more 'drunk' than usual. "In general, he drank more than his share of the alcoholic beverages existing there, and when we were together in the restaurants in Montmartre where it was obligatory to order



champagne, which I neither liked nor drank, he always drank it all himself with great pleasure. "Besides drinking too much he was also, as is said there, a great 'skirt chaser. ' "The moment he saw the 'pretty face' of a being of the female sex, his whole body and even his breathing abruptly changed. "I noticed that this time he was more drunk than usual, and after he had sat down beside me and ordered coffee with an 'aperitif,' I asked him . " 'Please explain to me, my young friend, why do you always drink this poison?'
"To this question of mine he answered: 'Ekh! My dear Doctor! I drink this poison, in the first place, because I
am so used to it that I cannot stop drinking without suffering, and in the
second place, because only thanks to the effect of the alcohol can I look on
calmly at the "obscenity" going on here,' and he waved his hand around.
" 'I started drinking this "poison," as you called it, because accidental circumstances, most unlucky for me, forced me to come and live for a long time in this maleficent Europe. " 'I began to drink because everybody I met drank and, unless you drink,
you are called a "weak sister," "goody-goody," "sissy," "milquetoast," and
similar derisive names Not wishing my business acquaintances to call me by
these offensive names I also began to drink.
'Furthermore, when I came to Europe for the first time I became aware that conditions of life here, in respect of morality and patriarchality, contrasted strongly with those in which I was born and brought up, and seeing and perceiving all this, I used to have a sickening feeling of shame and an unaccountable embarrassment. On the other hand, I noticed that alcohol not only relieved my distress, but al



lowed me to look at everything quite calmly and even wish to participate in this abnormal life, so contradictory to my nature and established views. " 'And that is why every time I feel this unpleasant sensation, I begin to drink, even with some feeling of self-justification, and little by little I have become accustomed to this "poison," as you have quite justly called it. ' "Having said this with a perceptible impulse of heartfelt grief, he paused a moment to light his cigarette made of a mixture of tobacco and 'tambak.' Taking this opportunity, I asked him: " 'Well and good . . . assuming that I have more or less understood your
explanation of your inexcusable drunkenness, and can put myself in your
shoes, what about your other vice, from my point of view just as
inexcusable—that is, your "drooling" after petticoats? Why, you run after
every skirt as long as it is around the hips of someone with long hair!'
"At this question of mine, he sighed deeply, and then replied: " 'It seems to me that I got this habit partly for the reason I already mentioned, but I think this weakness has still another interesting psychological explanation. " 'If you like, my dear Doctor, I will tell you in detail how I understand it myself.' "Of course I expressed my desire to hear him, but suggested our first going
inside the Grand Café, into the restaurant itself, as it was already getting damp
out of doors.
"When we were seated in the restaurant and had ordered a bottle of their
famous 'champagne,' he continued as follows:
'When you were living in Persia, my dear Doctor, perhaps you happened to observe the very definite attitude our Persian men have toward women.
'Among us in Persia, men have two quite distinct "or



game attitudes" toward women, according to which we unconsciously divide women into two categories. " 'The first attitude is the one we have toward the woman as the present or
future mother, and the second, the one we have toward the 'woman-female,'
as one might say.
" 'This characteristic of our Persian men of having data in their nature for these two distinct "organic attitudes" began to be formed in them only recently, about two and a half centuries ago. 'According to the explanations once given to me by my uncle, a mullah,
whom everyone called behind his back a "mullah of the old school," it seems
that, two or three centuries ago, for reasons evidently ensuing from certain
higher world laws, people began making war on each other more intensively
than usual everywhere on the Earth, especially among us in Asia, while at the
same time in most of the men the feeling of piety very definitely diminished
and in some of them entirely disappeared.
" 'Just at that period a certain form of psychic disease spread among the
men, and many of those afflicted with it either became quite insane or
committed suicide.
" 'Then certain wise people of different independent groups on the
continent of Asia, with the help of various representatives of medicine
which, by the way, was at that time on a much higher level than
contemporary medicine —began very earnestly to search for the causes of
that new human misfortune.
" 'After long and impartial labors they discovered, on the one hand, that
the men who contracted this disease were exclusively those in whose
subconscious, for some reason or other, there no longer arose any impulse of
faith in anyone or anything, and on the other hand, that those adult men who
periodically performed the normal ritual of intercourse with women were
immune to this disease.
" 'When the news of this conclusion of theirs spread over



the continent of Asia, the rulers and chiefs of the separate Asiatic groups of
that time grew alarmed, as almost all the regular troops at their disposal
consisted of adult men and, moreover, the constant wars did not permit them
to live normally with their families.
" 'Since at that period all those governing the different Asiatic countries
recognized their need for healthy and strong armies, they were obliged to
conclude a truce, and either to go in person or send their representatives to the
capital of what was then called the 'khanate of Kilmantoosh,' in order Jointly
to find a way out of the situation that had arisen.
'After serious reflections and deliberations, these rulers of the various
independent groups of Asiatic peoples, or their delegates, of course in
collaboration with the representatives of medicine of that time, came to the
conclusion that the only way to deal with the situation that had arisen would
be through the establishment of what is called 'prostitution' everywhere on the
continent of Asia, as it now exists on the continent of Europe, and that this
would succeed only if the power-possessing people deliberately cooperated in
its development.
" 'Almost all the chiefs of state of that time fully agreed with this
conclusion of the representatives of the peoples of the continent of Asia,
assembled in the capital of the khanate of Kilmantoosh and, from then on,
without experiencing any remorse of conscience, they not only began to
encourage and aid all women in general—with the exception of their own
daughters—to engage in this occupation, so abhorrent and repulsive to the
nature of every normal person, but also gave generous assistance to all those
women, of whatever caste or religion, who wished to go anywhere for this
dirty purpose, they even did this with a feeling of benevolence, as if it were
the most considerate and humane manifestation.
'Now that we have touched upon this subject, allow



me, respected Doctor, to digress slightly, and tell you about the wise and interesting reflections of my mullah uncle on the causes of this scourge of contemporary civilization. " 'Once, during Ramadan, when we were conversing as usual while awaiting the call of the mullah of our district that would announce the meal hour, we happened to be speaking about this human scourge, and my uncle said among other things. " ' "It is wrong and unjust of you to blame and despise all women of this kind. "Most of them are not personally responsible for their sad lot, the real culprits are their parents, husbands, and guardians. " ' "And indeed, the only ones to be blamed and despised are their parents or guardians who, while these children were at the age of preparation for adulthood and did not as yet have their own common sense, allowed the arising in them of the property called 'laziness.' ' "Although at that age this laziness is still only automatic in them and young people do not have to make great efforts to overcome it, so that on acquiring their own common sense they can prevent it from gaining complete control over them, nevertheless the organization of women's psyche is such that, owing to results not dependent on our will but ensuing from world laws, the active principle must unfailingly participate in every initiative and in every good manifestation of theirs. "It is thanks to the various ideas concerning 'rights of women' that are current throughout the contemporary world under the catchwords of 'equal rights,' 'equal opportunities,' 'women's suffrage,' and so on, ideas which are naive to the understanding of a man who has lived his life normally but which are unconsciously accepted by the majority of men today, that these unfortunate, not yet completely formed prospective women-mothers—on the one



hand not having near them during the early years of their adult life the law
conformable, requisite sources of the active principle, which their parents or
guardians should represent, and later their husbands, to whom the
responsibility for them passes from the moment of marriage, and on the other
hand undergoing the intense process of imagination and enthusiasm proper to
that transitional age and lawfully foreordained by nature to help provide data
for developing their common sense—gradually absorb this automatic laziness
into their very nature, where it remains as an increasingly irresistible need.
" ' "A woman with such a nature obviously does not wish to fulfill the
obligations of a genuine 'woman-mother,' and since being a prostitute enables
her to do nothing and even to experience great pleasure, there is gradually
formed both in her nature and in the 'passive consciousness' proper to her an
irresistible tendency to become a 'woman-female. '
"But as the data proper to all women for the impulse of 'shame' are not
atrophied all at once in the instinct of these 'women-females,' and as not one
of them, in spite of all her mental wishing, can bear to become a prostitute in
her own native country, each of them cries, instinctively or half-consciously,
to get away to some other country where, far from her native land, without
any inner discomfort, she can abandon herself entirely to this profession,
personally pleasant for her in almost every respect.
" ' "And as for the prevalence of this human misfortune everywhere on the
Earth today, this is due in my opinion exclusively to those contemporary men
in whom for the same reasons as in those young women, future prostitutes,
there arises a similar 'essential organic need to do nothing but enjoy oneself,'
and one of the ways in which this 'scum' of contemporary society satisfies that
criminal need is by enticing and helping such women to leave their native
land for some foreign country.



"Many sensible contemporary people have noticed that as a rule these beings of different sex, victims of the same disease, consciously or instinctively seek and find each other, justifying the saying that has existed from olden times 'One fisherman recognizes another from afar. ' " " 'And so, respected Doctor! Thanks to the causes so well understood by my wise uncle, in the following years many women-prostitutes from various other countries appeared among us in Persia. 'But owing to the instinctive attitude toward morality and patriarchality in family traditions acquired during centuries by the native women of Persia, regardless of their religion, these foreign women were unable to mix with the general mass of Persian women, with the consequence that from then on there began to exist among us the two categories of women I have mentioned. " 'Well then, owing to the fact that the majority of these foreign women lived freely among us in Persia and went about everywhere in the markets and other public places, they often attracted the attention of our Persian men during what is called the 'functioning of the sex center of gravity,' so that there was gradually formed in them, of course unconsciously, along with the already existing attitude toward women as "mothers," a quite different attitude toward women simply as "females." " 'The property of having this distinctly double attitude toward women, passing by inheritance from generation to generation, has finally become so rooted in us that at the present time our men not only distinguish these two categories of women by their appearance as easily as one distinguishes a man from a sheep, a dog, an ass, or whatever . . . but they have even acquired something which instinctively prevents them from mistaking a woman
of one category for a woman of the other.
" 'I myself could always tell, even from a distance, what



sort of woman was passing by. How I knew, whether by their walk or by
some other sign, with the best will in the world I cannot explain, but the fact
remains that I could always distinguish them, and was never mistaken,
although the women of both categories wore similar veils.
" 'And every normal Persian—that is, someone not under the influence of
"tambak," alcohol, or opium, the consumption of which has unfortunately
been spreading among us more and more in recent times—can always tell
without fail which woman is a "woman-mother" and which a "woman
female," that is, a "prostitute. "
" 'Every normal Persian considers a "woman-mother," to whatever religion
she may belong and regardless of family and personal relationships, as his
own sister, while women of the second category are simply like animals,
infallibly evoking in him a feeling of aversion.
" 'This capacity for instinctive behavior toward women is very strong in
our men and entirely independent of our consciousness.
" 'For example, suppose it should happen somehow or other that the
youngest and most beautiful woman of Persia found herself in bed with a man
of her locality, this man— provided, I repeat, that he is not under the
influence of opium or alcohol—would be organically unable, no matter how
strong his desire, to treat her as a female.
'He would regard her as his own sister, and, even if she were to manifest
"organic impulses" toward him, he would only pity her the more, considering
her as "possessed by an unclean power," and would try his best to help her
ward off this danger.
'And the same Persian, in a normal condition, will also be unable to treat
a woman of the second category, that is, a prostitute, as a woman-female, for
however young and beautiful she may be, he will inevitably experience an
organic aversion to her, and he could not treat her as a woman,



unless there had been introduced into his organism the toxic products I have
named, so maleficent for people.
" 'Well, my dear Doctor, I lived until my twentieth year in Persia,
respecting these morals and traditions, like every ordinary normal Persian
'At twenty, I happened to inherit some shares which made me a partner
in a certain large firm which exported Persian dried fruit to various European
communities.
" 'Thanks to my position in this firm, and various circumstances not
dependent on me, I became its chief representative in the countries of the
continent of Europe to which this fruit was exported.
'First I went to Russia, then to Germany, Italy, and other European
countries, ending up here in France, where I have already spent seven years
'In the life of none of these foreign countries is there such a sharp
distinction between these two types of women, the "woman-mother" and the
"woman-prostitute," as I saw and felt during my entire youth in my native
country.
'Everywhere in these countries the attitude toward women is purely
mental, that is, only imaginary, not organic.
'Here for instance, however unfaithful his wife may be, a husband will
never know it unless he sees it or hears of it.
'But among us in Persia, without having seen anything or heard any
gossip, a husband can tell instinctively whether his wife is unfaithful, and the
same thing applies to the woman—she can always sense the slightest
infidelity on the part of her husband.
'Several scientists from the continent of Europe have recently made
some very serious investigations in our country about this particular
instinctive sensation.
'As I happened to learn, they came to the conclusion that generally where the customs of "polyandry" or "po



lygamy" prevail—that is to say, where "several wives" or "several husbands"
are permitted by the established moral code—a certain "psycho-organic"
particularity is acquired in people in their relations as husbands and wives.
'This psycho-organic particularity also exists in the people of our Persia,
because, as you know, as followers of Islam, we have the custom of
polygamy, that is to say, each man is permitted by law to have as many as
seven wive.
" 'And this psycho-organic particularity in our Persian people, by the way,
is that in none of the lawful wives is there any feeling of the husband's
infidelity in regard to his other lawful wives.
" 'This feeling never appears in any of the wives except when the husband
is unfaithful with a strange woma.
'And it is only now, respected Doctor, living here in Europe and seeing
all that goes on between husbands and wives, that I fully appreciate our
custom of polygamy, so wisely established and so beneficial for both men and
women.
" 'Although every man among us is permitted several wives and not just
one, as is the case here in Europe where the Christian religion predominates,
yet the honesty and conscientiousness of our men toward their wives are
beyond all comparison with those of men here toward their single wife and
their family in general.
'Just look around you and see what is going on here. " 'If you glance around the rooms of this Grand Café, besides the ordinary
professional prostitutes and "gigolos" who are constant fixtures, you will
always see hundreds of men and women sitting at the little tables, chatting
gaily.
" 'At first sight you would say that these men and women are married
couples who are visiting Paris or attending to some family business.
'But as a matter of fact it is practically certain that in the whole of this Grand
Café not one of these couples chat



ting so gaily and about to go to some hotel together are legally man and wife, even though each one of them may be the legal husband or wife of someone else. " 'While these men and women are sitting here, their "legal halves" who
have remained at home in the provinces are probably imagining and telling all
their acquaintances very positively that their "legal wife" or "legal husband"
has gone to the world capital of Paris to make some important purchases for
the family, or to see somebody there, also very important for the family, or
something else of the same sort.
" 'But in reality, in order to get here, these "birds of passage" have had to
scheme for a whole year and cook up every kind of story to convince their
"legal halves" of the need for their trip And now that they are here, in the
company of deceivers and intriguers like themselves, they do their utmost, to
the greater glory of the nuptial hymn "Isaiah, Rejoice," aided by the fine art
attained by contemporary civilization in this respect, to decorate the foreheads
of their stay-at-home legal halves with the largest possible "artistic horns."
'In the European conditions of family life, if you see a man and a
woman together and, during their conversation, notice certain lively tones in
their voices and smiles appearing on their faces, you can be quite sure that
very soon, if they have not already done so, they will most effectively present
their "legal half" with a pair of the most magnificent horns.
" 'Hence any somewhat cunning man here can pass for a very honorable
man and the "patriarchal father of a family. "
" 'It is of no concern to those around him that this "honorable" man and
"patriarchal" father of a family has at the same time—if of course his means
permit—as many "mistresses" as he pleases on the side, on the contrary,
people usually show even more respect for such a man than for one who is
unable to have any mistresses at all.
'Here these "honorable husbands" who can afford it



have, in addition to their one legal wife, not seven but sometimes even seven
times seven "illegal wives."
" 'And those European husbands who are unable to support several "illegal
wives" in addition to their one "legal wife" spend almost the whole of their
time "drooling," that is, they do nothing all day long but ogle and, as it were,
"devour with their eyes" every woman they meet.
" 'In other words, in their thoughts and their feelings they betray their one
"legal wife" innumerable times.
" 'Although among us in Persia a man can have as many as seven legal
wives, all his thoughts and feelings are occupied day and night in planning as
best he can both the inner and outer life of these wives of his, and the latter, in
their turn, are absorbed in him and try their utmost, also day and night, to help
him in his life duties.
" 'Here, the inner relationship between husband and wife is the same on
both sides, Just as the inner life of the husband is almost entirely taken up
with being unfaithful to his one legal wife, so in her inner life, from the first
day of their union, she is always straying outside the family.
" 'As a rule, a European wife, as soon as she is married, considers her
husband, in her heart of hearts, as her "own property. "
" 'After the first night, believing herself thenceforth secure in her
ownership, she begins to devote the whole of her inner life to the pursuit of a
certain "something," that is, to the pursuit of an indefinable "ideal" which,
thanks to their famous "education," is gradually formed in every European
girl from early childhood, and is constantly being embellished, with more and
more subtlety, by various contemporary conscienceless writers.
'During my stay in these European countries, I have observed that there
is no longer formed in the being of women here that "something" which
should constantly maintain in her—as in our women—what is called "organic



shame," or at least the disposition to it, a feeling that in my opinion is the basis of what is called "wifely duty" and that helps her to refrain instinctively from those actions which make a woman immoral. 'That is why at any favorable opportunity any woman here can very easily, without suffering and without any remorse of conscience, betray her legal husband. 'In my opinion, it is the absence of this shame in European women that has gradually effaced the line dividing the "woman-mother" from the "woman-prostitute", and now these two categories of women have long since merged into one, and neither in their minds nor in their feelings do men make that distinction between women which almost every Persian man makes. 'Here one can distinguish the "woman-mother" from the "womanfemale" only if one sees all her manifestations with one's own eyes. 'In the European conditions of family life, owing to the absence of the beneficent institution of polygamy—an institution which in my opinion should long ago have been introduced here, if only for the simple reason that, as statistics show, women here far outnumber men—there are thousands of other inconveniences and controversies that need not exist at all. " 'And so, respected Doctor, the fundamental cause of my second vice was that having been born and brought up in traditions of morality diametrically opposed to those prevailing here, I came here at an age when the animal passions in a man are especially strong To my misfortune I came to Europe while still very young, and was considered, according to the notions here, very handsome My Persian type attracted a great many young women who saw in me a new and original variety of male, and started up a regular hunt after me.
'They hunted me like big game



'And I was "big game" for them not only on account of my specific
type, but also on account of the gentleness and courtesy toward women which
had been instilled in me from earliest childhood in my relationships with our
Persian "women-mothers. "
'When I came here I continued, though of course without realizing it, to
be gentle and courteous toward the women I met.
'And when I met with women here, at first we only talked—mostly on
the subject of contemporary civilization and of the so-called backwardness of
our Persia in comparison But one day, of course under the influence of
alcohol, which I was already consuming in rather large quantities, I fell for
the first time, that is to say, as a future father of a family, I behaved
abominably.
" 'Although at the time this cost me much suffering and remorse of
conscience, the influence of the environment, combined with the action of
alcohol, caused me to fall a second time And thereafter everything kept on
going downhill until in this respect I am now a most filthy animal.
'At times now, whenever I happen to be completely free from the
influence of alcohol, I suffer moral anguish and loathe myself with the whole
of my being, and at such moments I quickly turn again to alcohol to forget
myself and thus drown my sufferings.
" 'Having lived this ugly life in various European countries I finally settled
down here in Paris, in just that European city to which women come from all
parts of Europe and other continents with the obvious intention of "putting
horns" on their legal halves.
" 'And here in Paris I have become completely addicted to both these
human vices, alcohol and "skirt-chasing," as you call it, and I run here, there,
and everywhere without any discrimination And now the satisfaction of these
two



vices has become more necessary to me than the satisfaction of my hunger.
" 'That is how it has gone with me up to the present, and what will come next I do not know or care to know. 'Moreover, I always try to struggle with myself not to think about it. '
"With these last words, he sighed deeply and hung his head in dejection I
then asked him:
" 'But tell me, please, are you really not afraid of becoming infected by those terrible diseases carried by most of the women that "skirt-chasers" like you run after?' "At this question he again sighed deeply, and after a short pause he said
" 'Ekh! . . . my dear and esteemed Doctor! " 'In recent years I have thought about this question a great deal It has
even become a subject of such interest to me that, in spite of everything, it
has been in a certain sense the means whereby my miserable inner life has
flowed more or less endurably.
" 'As a physician, you will I think be greatly interested to know how and
why this question interested me so much a few years ago, and what
conclusions I came to after seriously observing and studying it whenever I
was in a relatively normal state.
" 'About five years ago I had such a spell of depression that even alcohol
had scarcely any effect on me and no longer relieved my psychic state.
'During this period I often happened to meet certain friends and acquaintances who talked a great deal about these shameful diseases and how easily one could be infected by them. 'These conversations started me thinking about myself, and little by little I began fretting about my health almost like a hysterical woman.



'It often ran through my mind that as I was almost always drunk and was
constantly having affairs with these infected women, then even if for some
reason I had, so far, no obvious symptom of these diseases, in all probability I
was already infected by one of them.
'So I decided to consult various specialists, in order to find out what
would be the early symptoms of any of the diseases I might have caugh.
'Although none of the local specialists found anything wrong with me, I
continued to worry because my fear of these diseases, as well as my own
common sense, supported my conviction that I must certainly already be
infected.
" 'All this brought me to the point at which I decided to have a consultation
here in Paris, regardless of cost, with the leading specialists in the whole of
Europe I could afford this expense because owing to the World War,
transportation had broken down everywhere and the price of commodities had
gone sky high, and our firm, having very large stocks of dried fruit in all our
warehouses, had made considerable profits that year, a good share of which
fell to me.
'These European celebrities, after all kinds of highly "detailed"
investigations and what are called "chemical analyses" of their own invention,
unanimously pronounced that there was not the slightest trace of venereal
disease in my organism.
'This conclusion of theirs put an end to my chronic worry about my
health, on the other hand, it implanted in me such a strong desire and curiosity
to clear up this question that from then on it became a sort of mama with me, a
kind of "idée fixe. "
" 'From that time on, my serious observation and study of everything
concerning these diseases animated and justified what I called my "wretched
life," and gave it meaning.
'During this period of my life I made these observations



and studies always with my whole inner real "I"—whether in a drunk, half
drunk, or sober stat.e
'Among other things I also read with avidity literature of all kinds
dealing with these diseases, including most of the books written on this
question in French and German.
'This was easy for me because, as you see, I have such a command of
French that you could hardly guess that I am not a real French intellectual,
and I get along very well in German, too, because I lived a fairly long time in
Germany, and for want of something to do, I studied their language and
literature in my spare time.
'So, when I became interested in this question, I was able to acquaint
myself with all the information existing in contemporary civilization on the
subject of venereal disease.
" 'In these books, hundreds of theories and hundreds of hypotheses were
given about the causes of venereal infection, but I could not discover one
convincing explanation of why some people are infected with these diseases
and others not I soon became convinced that I would not be able to learn this
from the knowledge existing at the present time here in Europe.
'However, from all this literature—of course putting aside a multitude of
thick "scientific" books, whose contents prove at first glance to every more or
less normal person that they were written by "complete ignoramuses" regard
ing these questions, that is to say, people knowing nothing at all about human
disease—I got the definite impression that people become infected by
venereal disease owing exclusively to their uncleanliness.
'When I reached this categorical conclusion, there was nothing left for
me but to concentrate all my attention upon finding out what there was in my
personal cleanliness that had so far protected me against infection " 'I began
to deliberate as follows:



'I do not dress any more cleanly than anyone else living here in Europe,
I wash my hands and face every morning like everyone else, once a week I
make a point of going to a Turkish bath, also, it seems, like everyone In
short, I turned over many things in my mind, and found nothing in which I
was exceptional in this respect And yet the fact remained that with my
loathsome life I ran every risk of infection.
" 'From then on my thoughts were guided by two impartial convictions
already fully rooted in me the first, that sooner or later anyone having
relations with these women must inevitably be infected, and the second, that
only cleanliness protects one from such infection.
'I continued to reflect in this manner for a whole week, until suddenly I
remembered a certain habit of mine which I have always scrupulously
concealed from my European acquaintances, the habit which we in Persia call
"abdast. "
" 'The practice of "abdast" or, as it might be called, "ablution," is one of the principal customs among us in Persia. " 'Strictly speaking, every follower of Islam must conform to this practice,
but it is followed scrupulously only by Muslims of the Shi'ite sect, and as
almost the whole of Persia is composed of Shi'ites, the custom is nowhere so
widely spread as among us.
" 'The custom of abdast consists, for every adherent of the Shi'ite sect,
male as well as female, in never failing to wash the sex organs after each visit
to the "water closet For this purpose, each family has certain appurtenances
considered indispensable among us, consisting of a special vessel, a particular
kind of jug, called "ibrik" And the richer the family, the more of these jugs
they must have, since one of them must be put at the disposal of every newly
arrived guest.
'I myself was also accustomed to this habit from early childhood, and it gradually so entered into my daily life that



even when I came to Europe, where this custom does not exist, I could not live a single day without making these "ablutions. " " 'In fact, it is much easier for me to go without washing my face, even
when I have a hangover, than not to wash certain parts of my body with cold
water after going to the "water closet. "
" 'Since I have been living here in Europe, I have to put up with a great
many inconveniences on account of this habit of mine, and even have to
forgo all the modern comforts which I could easily afford.
" 'For instance, here in Paris, I could easily afford to live at the best hotel
with every modern convenience, but thanks to this habit of mine, I am
obliged to live in some dingy hotel far from the center and from all the places
where I need to go every day.
'In the hotel where I live at the moment, the only comfort is the one that
is essential for me Since the building is of old construction, it still has "old
fashioned" water closets instead of these new American inventions, and it is
just that old system which is the most convenient and suitable for this habit of
mine.
" 'Who knows? Perhaps I even half-consciously chose France as my chief
dwelling place because it is still possible to find everywhere, especially in the
provinces, water closets of the old system such as we have in Persia.
" 'In the other countries of Europe this "Asian system," as they call it,
scarcely exists any more It has been almost entirely supplanted by the
American system with its "comfortable, well-polished easy chairs" upon
which I, personally, could only loll and read their famous book entitled The
Decameron.
" 'And so, my honorable Doctor, on suddenly remembering this habit of
mine, I understood at once, without any further doubt, that if I had hitherto
escaped infection by



some nasty disease, it was solely because I frequently wash my sex organs with cold water. ' "After these words, this congenial young Persian raised his arms and
exclaimed with his whole being.
'Blessed forever be the memory of those who created for us that beneficial custom!' "For a long while he said nothing further, but looked pensively at a party
of Americans sitting nearby who were arguing about whether women dress
better in England or America.
"Then suddenly he turned to me and said: " 'My dear and highly esteemed Doctor! During my acquaintance with
you I have become convinced that you are a man of broad culture and very
well educated.
" 'Perhaps you would be kind enough to give me your considered opinion,
so that I may at last understand and solve a certain problem, which during
recent years has often aroused my curiosity and disturbed my thoughts at the
moments when I am comparatively sober.
'How is it that since living here in Europe, where people profess the
religion practiced by almost half of humanity, I have so far not come across a
single good custom in their ordinary life whereas, among those of us who
profess Islam, there are so many that are excellent?
" 'What is wrong? What is the reason for this? Were there no good
ordinances established by the founders of that great religion for the ordinary
life of its followers?'
"Well, my boy, as this young Persian had won my sympathy in the course
of our acquaintance, I could not refuse to reply to his question. So I decided
to give him some explanation, but of course in such a form that he would not
suspect who I was nor what was my genuine nature.
"I told him: 'You say that in the religion professed by half of



humanity—and you probably mean the Christian religion —there are not such good customs as in your Island. " 'How so? On the contrary! That religion had many more good customs
than any of the other religions today, in none of the ancient religious
teachings were so many good regulations laid down for ordinary everyday life
as in the teaching on which the Christian religion was founded.
" 'But if the followers of this great religion themselves, especially those
who were called the "Fathers of the Church" of the Middle Ages, treated this
teaching, step by step, as Bluebeard treated his wives—abusing them and
destroying all their beauty and charm—that, indeed, is quite a different matter.
'You must know that in general all the great and genuine religions which
have existed down to the present time and which were created, as history
itself testifies, by men of equal attainment in regard to the perfecting of their
Pure Reason, are always based on the same truths.
" 'The difference between these religions lies only in the definite
indications given for the observance of certain details concerning what are
called "rituals " And this difference results from the way the great founders
intentionally adapted their indications to suit the degree of mental
development of the people of the given epoch.
" 'At the root of every new doctrine upon which a religion is based,
dogmas are always to be found belonging to earlier religions and already well
fixed in the life of the people.
" 'This fully justifies the saying which has existed among people from
olden times "There is nothing new under the sun."
" 'The only new things in each of these religious teachings are, as I have
said, the small details, intentionally adapted by the great founders to the level
of mental development of the people of the given epoch.



" 'At the root of the doctrine upon which the Christian religion is founded
there was placed almost the whole of the previously existing great teaching,
now called Judaism, whose followers were formerly also very numerous.
'The great founders of the Christian religion, having taken the Judaic
doctrine as the basis, changed only its outer details to conform to the degree of
mental development of the contemporaries of Jesus Christ, and they
effectively provided in this religion everything necessary for the welfare of
people.
" 'It made provision, as is said, both for the soul and for the body, and even
gave all the necessary indications for a peaceful and happy existence—and all
this was foreseen with surpassing wisdom, in order that this religion might
continue to be suitable for people even of much later epochs.
" 'If the teaching of this religion had remained unchanged, it might perhaps
even have suited contemporary people, whom by the way our Mullah Nasr
Eddin describes by the saying "He will blink only if you poke him in the eye
with a rafter. "
" 'In the Christian religion at its origin, besides the new special instructions
for ordinary existence which met the needs of the contemporaries of Jesus
Christ, there were also many excellent customs already in existence and well
established in the life of the followers of Judaism.
" 'Even certain good customs such as "sooniat," or circumcision, now
existing among you in Islam, passed to you from the Judaic religion This
custom was included at first in the Christian religion also, and at the beginning
it was obligatory, and was strictly observed by all its followers Only later, no
one knows why, it suddenly disappeared entirely from this religion.
" 'If you wish, my young friend, I will tell you in detail about the arising
of this custom of "sooniat," and you will understand from this why a practice
so good for the health



and normal life of people was included in the Judaic doctrine, and how, since
that doctrine was made the basis of the Christian religion, this custom was
bound to have been introduced into the process of the ordinary life of its
followers also.
'This custom which you call "sooniat" was first created and introduced
into the Judaic doctrine by the Great Moses.
" 'And as for the reason why the Great Moses introduced it into the
religion of the Jewish people, I discovered it in a very ancient Chaldean
manuscript.
" 'It was said in this manuscript that at the time when the Great Moses was
leading the Jewish people from the land of Egypt to the land of Canaan,
during the journey he noticed that a disease then called "moordoorten," which
contemporary people call "onanism," was becoming widespread among the
children and youths of the people entrusted to him from Above.
" 'It was further said in the manuscript that having ascertained this fact the
Great Moses became greatly perturbed, and from then on made close
observations in order to discover the causes of this evil and the means of
uprooting it.
'Later his research led this incomparable sage to write a book entitled
Tookha Tess Nalool Pan, which in contemporary language means "The
Quintessence of My Reflections "
" 'I once happened to become acquainted with the contents of this
remarkable book.
" 'At the beginning of his explanation of the disease, "moordoorten," it was
made clear, among other things, that the human organism has been brought to
such perfection by Great Nature that each and every organ has been provided
with a means of defense against every external contingency, and hence that if
any organ should function incorrectly in people, it must always be people
themselves who are to blame, on account of their own established conditions
of everyday life.



'And as for the causes of the appearance of "moor-doorten" among
children, it was said in Chapter VI, Verse XI, of this incomparable book that
this disease occurs in children for the following reasons:
'Among the definite substances elaborated by the human organism and
constantly eliminated as waste, there is one called "kulnabo."
'This substance is generally elaborated in the organism of beings for the
purpose of neutralizing other substances necessary for the functioning of their
sex organs, it is formed and participates in the functioning of these organs
soon after the arising of the beings of both sexes, that is, from their infancy.
'Great Nature has so arranged it that after its utilization, the residue of
this substance is discharged from the organism, in boys at the place between
the "toolkhtotino" and the "sarnuonino," and in girls at the place between the
"kartotakhnian hills."
" 'In this incomparable book, what are called "toolkhtotino" and "sarnuonino"
correspond to what contemporary medicine calls "glans penis" and "prepuce
penis," and are found at the end of what is called the "genital member" in
boys The "kartotakhnian hills," in girls, covering what is called the "clitoris,"
are called "labia majora" and "labia minora" or, in ordinary language, the
"large and small lips " " 'Contemporary medicine has no name at all for the
substance "kulnabo," which is entirely unknown to it as an independent
substance.
'Contemporary medicine has a name only for the general mass of
substances in which the substance "kulnabo" is included.
'And this total mass, which it calls "smegma," is composed of entirely
heterogeneous substances, secreted by various glands having nothing in
common with each other,



such as the "sebaceous glands," the "Bartholinian glands," the "Cowperian," the "nolniolnian," and others. 'The elimination and volatilization of these waste substances are meant to take place in those parts of the organism, in accordance with the providence of Great Nature, through all kinds of chance contacts and various movements occurring in the atmosphere. " 'But the clothing that people have invented for themselves, unforeseen by Nature, prevents these factors from freely effecting the processes of elimination and volatilization, with the result that the "kulnabo," remaining for a long time in these places, promotes the arising of "perspiration," which is the very best medium for the multiplication of bacteria existing in the atmosphere as well as in the "subjective sphere" of every object that comes into direct contact with the children And this multiplication provokes in those parts of the organism of children what is called "itching." " 'On account of this itching children begin, unconsciously at first, to rub or
scratch these places.
'Since it is in these parts of the organism that there are concentrated all the nerve endings created by Nature for the special sensation required for the accomplishment of the sacred process of "elmooarno," which normally arises in adult people at the end of what is called "copulation," they experience from this rubbing or scratching a certain peculiar, pleasant sensation, especially at certain periods when, according to the providence of Great Nature, there takes place in the organs of children a process of preparation for future sexual functioning And from then on, sensing instinctively from which of their actions this pleasant sensation is evoked in them, they begin to rub these places intentionally, even when there is no itching And thus the ranks of the little "moordoortenists" on the Earth are always increasing by leaps and bounds.



'As regards the measures taken by the Great Moses for eradicating this evil, these I learned not from the incomparable book Tookha Tess Nalool Pan, but from the contents of a very ancient papyrus. " 'The contents of this papyrus made it clear that the Great Moses put into practice the ideas set down on this question in the book Tookha Tess Nalool Pan by creating for his people those two religious rites, one of which was called "sikt ner tchorn" and the other "tziel pootz kann. " " 'The sacred "sikt ner tchorn" was specially created for boys and the sacred "tziel pootz kann" for girls, their practice was obligatory. " 'The rite of "sikt ner tchorn" for instance, was identical with your "sooniat " It consisted in cutting what is called the "vojiano" or the "frenum penis" of boys, whereby the connection is severed between the head of the genital member and the skin covering it, thus permitting the free movement of this skin or, as it is called, the "prepuce penis." " 'As proven by the information which has come down to us from ancient times, and also according to our own common sense, it is plain that the Great Moses who, as we learned from another source, was a very great authority on medicine, wished by this means to make sure that, through all kinds of accidental contacts, the totality of substances accumulating in the places I spoke of would of itself be mechanically eliminated, and thus cease to become a factor for the arising of that maleficent itching. " 'As regards the vast learning of the Great Moses in the province of medicine, many diverse historical sources agree that he acquired his medical knowledge during his stay in Egypt as a pupil of the high priests, to whom this knowledge had come down from their ancestors of the continent of Atlantis, those first and last genuinely learned beings of the Earth, the members of the Society of Akhldanns.



" 'The beneficial results of the customs created by the Great Moses are still
visible today.
" 'For instance, concerning the custom of circumcision, I, being a good
diagnostician and able to tell from one glance at a man's face what
disharmony there is in his organism, can safely say that this terrible children's
disease of "onanism" is scarcely ever found among those children upon whom
this rite has been performed, whereas the children whose parents fail to
observe this custom are almost all subject to it.
'Certain of those who are not subjected to the rite of circumcision do
escape this disease of 'onanism," but these rare exceptions are the children of
parents who are cultured in the full sense of the word, and who understand
clearly that the future normal mentation of their children depends exclusively
upon whether they do or do not suffer from this disease in their childhood or
youth.
" 'Such cultured parents know full well that if their children experience in
their nervous system the sensation of the climax of what is called the
"ooamonooanossnian process" even once before they reach maturity, they will
never be fully capable of normal mentation when they become adult, and
hence these parents always consider it their first and chief duty toward their
children to educate them in this respect.
" 'Unlike most contemporary parents, they do not consider that the
education of children consists in badgering them to learn by rote as much
poetry as possible, composed by "moordoortenist psychopaths," or in teaching
them to shake hands politely with their friends and acquaintances, for in
keeping with the notions of people of our times, unfortunately it is these
"accomplishments" which constitute the whole education of children today.
" 'And so, my dear, very depraved, but nevertheless likable young man



'These two rites were created by the Great Moses and introduced into the
ordinary life of the Jewish people to counteract that maleficent invention of
clothes, thanks to which those factors were destroyed which had been
provided by Nature for the protection of those organs from the harmful action
of the substances they secrete, and these two rites were transmitted from
generation to generation, both to the followers of the Judaic religion and to
others who took over these useful rites almost unchanged It was only after the
death of the great King Solomon that the rite of "tziel pootz kann" ceased to
be observed even by the followers of the Judaic religion, and only the rite of
"sikt ner tchorn" continued to be performed automatically, and reached the
contemporary representatives of that race.
" 'This custom, along with many other ancient Jewish customs, also
reached the followers of the Christian religion, who at first observed it very
strictly in their everyday life, but soon the custom itself disappeared from this
still new religion, and even the memory of its former use among them was lost.
" 'Yes . . . my dear friend, if only the teaching of the divine Jesus Christ had
been fully respected in its original form, the religion founded upon it with
such unprecedented wisdom would not only be the best of all existing
religions, but even of all religions that might arise and exist in the future.
" 'To return to your Islam, except for the custom of polygamy, it contains
nothing which cannot also be found in the Judaic and Christian teachings.
" 'The custom of polygamy, established on the basis of the scientific
deductions of the Arabian learned being Naoolan el-Aool, famous in his time,
was introduced into the daily life of people after the founding of the Christian
religion.
'Your religion appeared much later, and it was inten



tionally restricted by its great founders, who had in mind to lay particular
stress on certain everyday customs.
'They did this because at that time two facts had become clearly
manifest the decline of the Christian religion, and the disappearance in
ordinary people of the capacity for "contemplation," that is, for the state in
which alone the truths indicated in detail by genuine religious teachings can
be understood.
'Having become aware of these facts, the great creators of Islam
decided, on the one hand, to simplify the teaching itself, and on the other
hand, to emphasize certain customs so that the everyday life of the followers
of this new religion, who had lost the capacity for contemplation and conse
quently the possibility of understanding truths consciously, might flow, even
if mechanically, in a more or less tolerable manner.
'And it was then that, among other customs, they established and laid
particular stress on the practices of "sooniat," "abdast," and polygamy, the
beneficial results of which we can see even now.
'For example, as you have Justly observed, thanks to circumcision and
ablution, one rarely finds either onanism or certain venereal diseases among
the followers of your religion, and, thanks to polygamy, the foundation of
family life among them rests on a reciprocal so to say "psycho-organic
support" that is almost entirely absent among the followers of the Christian
religion.
" 'Of all the useful customs introduced by the great founders of the
Christian religion into the life of its followers for the preservation of health
and the maintenance of the morality necessary for a happy life, nothing now
remains except the custom of periodic fasting, that is, of abstaining at certain
times of the year from the consumption of particular edible products.
'And even this last surviving good custom is either dis



appearing completely from the ordinary life of the followers of this religion,
or is undergoing such changes year by year that for those who "fast" no shock
is obtained from its observance, although it was just for that shock that this
fast was established.
'The changes now taking place in this custom of fasting are very
characteristic and provide an excellent example of how all the good Christian
customs have little by little undergone change, until they have finally ceased
to exist.
" 'An excellent illustration of this is the manner in which this fast is
observed at the present day by those called "Russian Orthodox Christians "
" 'These Russian Orthodox Christians took their religion in its entirety from
the Orthodox Greeks, who passed on to them, along with other Christian
customs, this same custom of "fasting. "
" 'Among the millions of these Russian Orthodox Christians the majority
still continue to fast, as is said, "scrupulously," according to the "Orthodox
code" now existing there.
" 'But how they actually perform this ritual of fasting, this can only be
described by the apt saying of our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin:
" ' "What does it matter if I sing like a donkey as long as they call me a
nightingale?"
" 'It is just the same with the fasting of these Russian Orthodox Christians
as long as they are called Christians and moreover Orthodox—what does it
matter that they receive no "shock" whatever from the fast?
" 'As I have said, these Russian Orthodox Christians of the present time still
observe very strictly all the seasons and days of fast indicated in their code.
'But as for what should or should not be eaten during a fast, it is just in
that question that the "left paw of the curly-haired dog of ex-Emperor
Wilhelm" lies buried.



" 'You will understand clearly how these contemporary Russian Orthodox Christians fast if I repeat the exact words of one of them, spoken to me not long ago in Russia. " 'I used to meet this Russian there on business and even became somewhat friendly with him and visited him at his house. 'He was considered by those around him to be a very good Christian and the "patriarchal father of a family,” he came from the sect of the "Old Believers. " 'Old Believers are those Orthodox Christians whose ancestors, several centuries ago, refused to submit to new rules then laid down by "somebody or other," and who remained faithful followers of the previous rules, also laid down by "somebody or other," only a century or two before this religious schism. " 'And so one day, when I was dining at the house of this worthy Old
Believer in the company of several other Russians, also Orthodox Christians,
he turned to me and said:
" ' "Ekh! old dear!" " 'By the way, I must tell you that the beings of this group have the habit, after the second glass of genuine Russian vodka, of calling their acquaintances by various pet names, such as "old dear," "my zapoopoonchik," "my pot-bellied beauty," "my little brown Jug," and so on and so forth. " 'And so this worthy Russian Orthodox Christian, addressing me as "old
dear," said:
"Never mind, old dear! We shall soon be having Lent and then we shall feast together on genuine Russian dishes . " ' "To tell the truth, here in Russia, during 'meat days' we almost always eat the same things . "But during fasts, especially during Lent, it is quite a different story! "Not a day goes by but one is privileged to enjoy the most succulent dishes.



"You know what, old dear? "Just the other day I made a remarkable 'discovery' on this very
subject.
"This discovery of mine is miles beyond the discovery of that old
codger Copernicus, who when he was once lying dead drunk on the ground
sensed clearly, it seems, that the Earth goes round.
" ' "You call that a marvelous discovery? In our own mother Moscow
alone, hundreds of thousands of such discoveries are probably made every
day!
" ' "No! . . . My discovery is a real one that is highly intelligent and
instructive.
"I discovered that up till now we have all been complete fools and
hopeless idiots ever to have imagined and been convinced that for the host of
varied and tasty dishes during Lent we are indebted to the famous art of our
chefs and cooks.
" ' "The day, especially blessed for those nearest to me, when I became
worthy of understanding this truth, was the day our incomparable Doonyasha
finally succeeded in placing within the layers of stuffing in the pies to
accompany the 'gromwell soup with turbot livers' a series of secondary layers.
On that day I understood with my whole being what our mistake had been.
" ' "First I understood it myself, and afterward I proved it to the whole of
my household—that if, during fasts, we have such varied and tasty dishes, we
are indebted to our blessed and glorious fish alone.
" ' "During fasts, and especially during Lent, our homes are gladdened by
the frequent visits of the
Most Honorable Sturgeon and the Estimable
Sterlet and the Respected Sole and the Ever
memorable Turbot and



Her Serene Highness the Salmon and the Musical Tench and the Always-supple Mackerel and the Eternally Angry Pike and the Sanctimonious Carp and the Lively Trout and the Superb Whitefish and the Proud Herring and that Powerful Personality the Bream, and all our other benefactors and protectors
" ' "When we hear their names, our hearts leap within us "These names of theirs are not just names, but real music
"Can one really compare the musical harmonies of various Beethovens
and Chopins, or other fashionable triflers, with the sounds of the names of
these blessed fish?
" ' "Every time we hear the names of these glorious creatures a feeling of
bliss flows within us and courses through our veins and nerves.
" ' "O Blessed Fish, ye who were the first to be created by our Creator'
Have mercy on us and sustain us, even on 'meat days ' Amen.
" 'After this prayer, the worthy Orthodox Russian Christian drained a
monster glass of genuine refined Russian vodka and stared fondly at a little
statue of "Venus and Psyche" standing nearby.
'And indeed, my friend, every Russian Orthodox Christian has a more or
less similar attitude toward fasting.
'During these Christian fasts, which came from the Orthodox Greeks, they all eat the flesh offish. 'It is not considered a "sin" for them to eat the flesh of fish, and they eat
it heartily as a "fast dish. "
" 'I personally find only one thing incomprehensible



where did these Russian "sorry Orthodox" get the idea that during the
Christian fasts, especially during Lent, they may eat the flesh of fish?
" 'I find this incomprehensible because those Orthodox Christians from
whom they took their religion, that is, the Greeks, have never eaten and do not
now eat the flesh of fish during fasts.
" 'Even today the Greeks eat fish during Lent only on one day, when in
accordance with the code of the Orthodox Church they celebrate the memory
of a day in the life of the divine Jesus Christ
" 'A fast permitting the consumption of the flesh offish not only gives no
shock at all to those who are fasting, but is even directly contrary to what the
divine Jesus Christ intended and taught, and contrary to the purpose of the
great creators of the Christian religion in establishing this custom.
" 'In confirmation of what I have just told you, my young friend, I will tell
you what I once chanced to read about Christian fasting in an ancient "Judeo
Essenian" manuscript
" 'In this ancient manuscript it was stated that the custom of fasting at
certain times of the year was instituted among the followers of the teaching of
Jesus Christ long after his death, that is, in the 214th year after his birth
" 'The custom of fasting was authorized and introduced into the Christian
religion by the great secret "Council of Kelnuan."
" 'This secret Council of Kelnuan was convened by all the followers of the
still-new teaching of Jesus Christ, and was held in the locality of Kelnuk,
lying on the shores of the Dead Sea Hence it is known in the history of the
Christian religion as the Council of Kelnuan.
'And it was held in secret because, at that epoch, the followers of the
teaching of Jesus Christ were ruthlessly persecuted everywhere by the power
possessing people.



" 'And these power-possessors persecuted them because they greatly feared that if everybody lived according to this teaching—even though they themselves could also live very well—all the motives for displaying their power would disappear, thereby depriving them of those impulses the satisfaction of which tickled their inner god, "self-love. " " 'And so it came about that during that Council of Kelnuan, its members first laid down the rule that the followers of the teaching of Jesus Christ should abstain on certain days from consuming certain edible products. 'The initial cause of the institution of fasting was the debate that took place at the Council of Kelnuan between two famous learned men, namely, the great Hertoonano and the illustrious Greek philosopher, Veggendiadi. " 'The great Hertoonano was the representative of all the followers of the
teaching of Jesus Christ who were settled on the shores of the Red Sea, while
the philosopher Veggendiadi was the representative of all the followers of that
teaching in Greece.
" 'The philosopher Veggendiadi was well known for his learning only in his own country, while Hertoonano was famous all over the Earth He was considered the highest authority on the laws of the inner organization of man, and also an authority on the science then called "alchemy"—not of course that science of which contemporary people have a notion and designate by the same name. 'The famous debate between the great Hertoonano and Veggendiadi
arose in the following circumstances:
'The philosopher Veggendiadi, it seems, affirmed and demonstrated for two days that it was absolutely necessary to spread the concept among all the followers of the teachings of Jesus that to kill animals for the purpose of consuming their flesh for food was the greatest sin, and that at the same time meat was very harmful to health, and so on.



" 'After the philosopher Veggendiadi, several other representatives ascended the rostrum and spoke for or against his theory. " 'Finally, according to this manuscript, the great Hertoonano, with measured dignity, slowly mounted the rostrum and spoke clearly and calmly, in the manner proper to him.
" 'He said: " ' "For my part, I fully concur in all the evidence and arguments set forth here by our brother in Christ, the philosopher Veggendiadi. " ' "I will even add to all he has said that to cut short other lives merely to stuff one's own belly is an infamy of infamies such as only man is capable of. "Had I not also been interested in this question for many years and had I not reached certain entirely different conclusions, then after all that our brother in Christ, Veggendiadi, has said here, I would not have hesitated a moment but would have urged and conjured you all not to delay until tomorrow but, without looking behind you, to hasten back to your towns and cry aloud in all the public squares 'Stop! People! Stop! Stop eating meat! This practice of yours is not only contrary to all the commandments of God, but is the cause of all your diseases. " ' "As you see, I am not doing this. And I am not doing so only because
during my long years of unremitting study of this question, I reached, as I
have already told you, an entirely different conclusion.
"Concerning the definite conclusion I have reached, I can only tell you now that never will there be a time on this Earth when all people profess one and the same religion Hence, in addition to our Christian religion, other religions will always exist And one cannot be certain that the followers of these other religions will also abstain from consuming meat.



" ' "But if we cannot now be certain that at some time or other all the
people on the Earth will abstain from meat, then we must now take quite other,
more practicable measures as regards consuming meat, because if one part of
mankind eats meat and the other part does not, then, according to the results of
my experimental investigations, the greatest of evils would befall the people
who abstain from its consumption.
' "My detailed experiments have shown me, for example, that among
people who do not eat meat but who nevertheless live among those who do,
the formation of what we call 'will power' ceases.
"My experiments also proved to me that although people's bodily
health improves when they do not consume meat, as long as such abstainers
are in contact with those who do consume it, their psychic state inevitably
deteriorates, even if the state of their organism continues to improve.
" ' "Thus, for people who abstain from meat a good result can be obtained
only if they live in complete isolation.
' "As regards those who constantly consume meat, or products containing
the element called 'eknokh,' although the state of their organism seems to
undergo no change, their psyche, especially its chief traits, sometimes
designated by the general word 'character,' gradually loses its positive and
moral qualities and changes for the worse beyond all recognition.
' "I must tell you that I reached these conclusions from experiments I was
able to conduct over a period of many years, thanks to two good philanthropic
men, namely, the rich shepherd Alla Ek Linokha, who helped me with his
money, and the scientist, respected by us all, El Koona Nassa, who let me use
his remarkable invention, an apparatus called 'arostodossokh. '
"With this remarkable apparatus I was able for several



years to keep under daily observation the general state of the organism of
thousands of people who lived under test conditions at the expense of the
good shepherd Alia Ek Linokha.
' "May our Creator multiply his flocks! ' "Well then, thanks to this
experimental research of mine, I became fully convinced that if people
continue to consume meat for their food it will be very bad for them and that,
on the other hand, if only some of them abstained, no good would come of
this either And so thereafter I devoted myself entirely to finding out what
could be done for the future welfare of the majority of peopl.e
" ' "At the outset, I categorically established the following facts:
" ' "The first, that people accustomed for so many centuries to consuming
meat for their food would never, with their weak wills, be able to make
themselves renounce it and overcome this criminal tendency of theirs, and the
second, that even if people decided not to eat meat and in fact kept to their
decision for a certain time, eventually even losing this habit, they would never
be able to abstain from eating it for a long enough period to acquire a total
aversion to it And they would be unable to do so because never on the Earth
will it occur that all people have the same religion or form a single
government, and without these conditions there can never exist any
suggestive, prohibitive, penal, or other kind of compulsory influence,
common to all, thanks to which people who are easily stimulated by example
or envy, or by some magnetic influence, might be able to keep a resolution
forever once it is taken.
"Notwithstanding these two facts, to my mind incontestable, and
taking them as the basis of my subsequent investigations, I persevered in my
search for some possible way out of the unhappy situation confronting people.
"And again, of course, I was only able to continue



these investigations on a large scale thanks to the inexhaustible wealth of the
herdsman Alia Ek Linokha, and the wonderful apparatus of the wise El Koona
Nassa.
" ' "These last researches of mine made it clear to me that although
people's psyche does indeed deteriorate from the constant introduction into
the organism of the substance 'eknokh,' yet it is only at certain times of the
year that this substance has a particularly harmful effect.
" ' "So, my brethren in Christ from all I have said and chiefly from my
latest observations, made daily during a whole year on numbers of people,
and which clearly showed me that the intensity of the harmful effect of the
substance 'eknokh' increases at certain times of the year, I can only now make
bold to express my personal opinion that if there were to be spread among the
followers of the teachings of Jesus Christ the custom of abstaining at certain
designated times of the year from the use of products in the formation of
which the substance 'eknokh' plays a dominant part, such a custom could
conceivably be observed and would bring the people a real benefit.
" ' "As my numerous alchemical investigations have shown me, the
substance 'eknokh' participates in the formation of all living organisms
without exception, wherever they may exist—on the surface of the Earth,
within its depths, in the water, in the atmosphere, and so on.
"This substance is also present in everything contributing to the
formation of these organisms, as for example in the amniotic fluid of every
species of pregnant female, and in such products as milk, eggs, caviar, and so
on.
" 'The ideas expressed by the great Hertoonano so astounded and agitated
all the members of the Council of Kelnuan that the commotion made it
impossible for him to continue, so he was obliged to abandon his speech and
descend from the rostrum.
" 'The manuscript stated further that by the end of the



day the members of the Council of Kelnuan had come to a unanimous
decision to specify, with the help of the great Hertoonano, those times of the
year when the effects of the substance "eknokh" were most harmful for
people, and to spread widely among the followers of Jesus Christ the custom
of fasting at those times—that is, of abstaining from products containing the
substance "eknokh" injurious for them.
" 'With this, the Judeo-Essenian manuscript ended. 'As you can see, the creators of this custom intended that the followers
of the Christian religion should abstain at certain fixed times of year from the
products containing this substance, harmful for their health and particularly
for their psyche.
'But the sorry Russian Orthodox Christians, who consider themselves
faithful followers of this great religion and also fast, eat the flesh of fish
during their fast, that is, those very organisms which, according to the
research of the great Hertoonano, contain that harmful substance "eknokh",
and it was precisely to guard them against that substance that this wise and
salutary custom was created. '
"And here, my boy, I concluded my conversation with that young Persian.
"And as for the way contemporary beings have destroyed or changed these
good customs which were handed down from their wise ancestors of ancient
times—for this also our incomparable Mullah Nasr Eddin has a very apt and
wise saying.
" 'Ekh! People, people' Why are you people? If only you were not people,
perhaps you would be more intelligent.
"A favorite saying of the famous American Uncle Sam expresses the same
idea very well.
"When Uncle Sam happens to have drunk a little too much



gin, he always says, between drinks 'When nothing's right, only then it's all right. '
"But for myself, I will only say 'Wicked moon!' "At any rate, my dear boy, it must be admitted that certain customs which
have reached your contemporary favorites from remote antiquity are
exceedingly good for the ordinary existence of the beings there.
"These customs are good because they were invented and introduced into the process of ordinary existence by terrestrial three-brained beings who had brought the perfecting of their Reason up to a very high degree—a degree that unfortunately none of your contemporary favorites any longer attains. "The only customs that contemporary beings are able to create are those
that further degrade the quality of their psyche.
"For instance, they have recently made a practice of always dancing, here,
there, and everywhere, a certain dance called the 'fox trot. '
"At the present time this 'fox trot' is the rage everywhere They dance it at
all times of the day and night, not only the young, still unformed beings, who
do not even begin to be aware of the meaning and aim of their existence, but
also those whose faces clearly express—as can be observed by every more or
less sensible three-brained being—that in respect of the duration of their
existence as our teacher would say, 'not only do they have one foot in the
grave, but even both ' As a matter of fact, what is experienced by a being
during this fox trot is exactly the same as what proceeds during that children's
disease which the Great Moses called 'moordoorten.'
"The Great Moses devoted half of his existence to eradicating this disease
from among children—a disease that certain of your contemporary favorites
of responsible age have



resurrected almost deliberately, one might say, and spread not only among
children but also among adults and even among the aged.
"As I have already told you, among the good customs for ordinary existence
that reached your contemporary favorites from ancient times, many are still
practiced by the beings of various communities of the continent of Asia.
"Certain of these customs appear at first sight absurdly strange and
barbaric, but on close and impartial investigation of their inner meaning, one
is astonished by the skill with which certain moral or hygienic benefits were
incorporated in them for the people who follow them.
"Take, as an example, what appears to be one of the most senseless
customs, found among a certain tribe of Asiatic beings called 'Kolenian Lurs'
or 'Kolenian gypsies' dwelling between Persia and Afghanistan.
"This custom, which the other beings of your planet call 'gypsy self
fumigation,' however stupid it may appear, produces the same result as the
Persian custom of 'ablution' or 'abdast. '
"This gypsy tribe is regarded as the lowest and filthiest of all the tribes
existing on the Earth. And indeed, they are so filthy that their clothes are
always swarming with the insects called 'lice. '
"By the way, their custom of 'self-fumigation' also serves to destroy these
insects.
"Although the members of this tribe are really exceedingly filthy, not only
do no venereal diseases exist among them but they have never even heard that
such diseases can be contracted.
"In my opinion, their freedom from these diseases is entirely due to that
custom of theirs, which some sensible being of olden times invented for the
welfare of the people of his epoch and which, passing from generation to
generation,



chanced to reach these contemporary filthy beings of the tribe of Kolenian gypsies. "For this rite of 'self-fumigation,' every family of gypsies has what is called
an 'ateshkam,' or stool of a special form, which they regard as sacred, and the
entire ritual is performed with the aid of this sacred stool.
"Every one of these gypsy families also has what is called a 'tandoor,' that
is, a special kind of earthen pit, such as is found in almost every house in
Asia, that serves as a hearth on which they bake bread and prepare food.
"In these tandoors they burn chiefly what is called 'keeziak'—a fuel
composed of the dung of quadruped animals.
"The rite consists in this: "When the family of gypsies returns home in the evening they first remove
all their clothes and shake them out over the tandoor.
"It is almost always hot in the tandoor because the dung burns very slowly
and the embers from the keeziak keep the fire burning for a very long time.
"It is interesting to remark, by the way, that when these gypsies shake out
their clothes over the tandoor a highly interesting phenomenon results from
this action, namely, the lice crawl out of their clothes, fall into the fire, and
explode before burning, and the sounds of the explosion of these lice, large
and small, produce a surprising 'musical symphony.'
"Sometimes these explosions of lice give one the impression that dozens of
their machine guns are being fired somewhere not far off.
"Well then, after these 'worthy gypsies' have shaken out their no less
worthy clothing, they proceed with the sacred ritual.
"First of all, solemnly, and with a certain ceremony, they lower their sacred family stool into the tandoor, and in turn,



from the oldest to the youngest, they step onto the stool. "The sacred stool consists simply of a narrow board to which four iron legs
are fixed, and thanks to this stool it is possible for them to stay in the tandoor
without burning their feet in the hot embers.
"As each member of the family in turn stands on that sacred stool, all the
others sing their sacred canticle, while the one standing upon the stool,
bending his knees, slowly and solemnly lowers and raises himself and at the
same time recites prayers The custom requires that he should do this until all
parts of his sex organs have been warmed by the tandoor.
"I saw another custom, very similar and seemingly just as stupid, among
the people of another small tribe called the 'Toosooli Kurds,' dwelling in
Transcaucasia not far from 'Mount Ararat. '
"This tribe is not dirty like the 'Kolenian gypsies ' On the contrary, these
people, from their daily bathing in the 'Aras River' and their life in the open
they are chiefly shepherds—are not only very clean but they even do not give
off the specific odor peculiar to the people of almost all the small tribes which
populate this great Asia.
"Each family of this tribe of Kurds has its own what is called 'saklia,'
which serves as a dwelling and for the reception of guests—as the custom of
visiting one another is highly developed in this tribe.
"In each 'saklia,' or hut, it is customary for them to have in a corner by the
entrance what is called a sacred 'mangaal,' that is, a hearth on which a fire of
charcoal or keeziak is constantly smoldering, and near each sacred mangaal
hangs a small wooden box called 'ktalnotz,' which is always kept supplied
with the roots of a certain plant.
"The rite of self-fumigation requires that before going into the principal
section of the hut, each member of the family and each guest, of either sex,
must enter this sacred



mangaal in order to 'purify' himself, as they say, from the influence of those evil spirits by which man is surrounded when he is busy with honest work "And this 'purification' is carried out in the following manner.
"Everyone on going into the hut must approach and take a few roots out of
the hanging box and throw them into the fire, and then, in the smoke from the
burning of these roots, fumigate the sex organs.
"If it is a woman, she simply spreads her skirt and stands over the mangaal. If it is a man, he either takes off or lets down his 'sharvars' and also stands over the smoke. "Only after such 'purification' can they enter the main room, otherwise, as
they believe, not only will evil influences be brought into the house, but
through the accumulation of these influences a man might contract very
serious diseases.
"These sacred mangaals are usually screened off by the very best
'djedjims,' that is, special fabrics woven only by the Kurd.
"I repeat, my boy, at the present time on the continent of Asia there exist
many similar customs.
"I personally saw hundreds of them, which at first sight seemed no less
strange and barbarous but, upon a serious and impartial study of their hidden
meaning, always revealed the same aims on the one hand, the destruction of
the noxious carriers of various diseases, and on the other, the strengthening of
moral shame.
"But on the continent of Europe I found scarcely a single custom specially
created either for purposes of hygiene or for instilling a moral sense among
the masses.
"There's no denying that various customs do exist on the continent of Europe, even thousands of them, but the beings there have established them all only to have the possibility of pleasing one another, or to conceal the real state of affairs, that is, to disguise the undesirable forms of their outer



appearance—undesirable, of course, only according to their subjective conceptions—and to conceal the nullity of their own inner significance . "The customs prevailing there at present increase year by year the opposition between the personality and the Reason of those beings. "But the principal evil lies in this, that at the present time the entire 'oskianotsnel' of the rising generation, or the education of children, is reduced to the adoption of these innumerable practices that exist among them and engender only immorality Hence it is that on the one hand, the data crystallized in them during tens of centuries for aiding the formation of a being 'in the image of God' and not simply of an 'animal,' as they would say, are decrystallized year by year and, on the other hand, their psyche is becoming almost such as our dear teacher describes by the words
" 'There is everything in him except himself.' "And indeed, my boy, owing to the complete absence of good patriarchal customs and to their notorious 'education,' the contemporary beings of that continent have already become completely transformed into what are called 'automatons' or living mechanical puppets. "At the present time, they can become animated and manifest themselves
outwardly only when one happens to press the 'buttons' corresponding to
impressions already present in them and mechanically perceived during their
preparatory age.
"And unless these 'buttons' are pressed, the beings there are nothing more, as again our highly esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin says, than 'assorted pieces of meat. ' "It should be noted here, my boy, that one of the principal causes of this
state of the beings of contemporary civilization is also that same 'onanism' of
theirs This disease, which in recent times is almost epidemic, is a
consequence of their



education which inculcates, among other principles, a certain maleficent idea that has become profoundly rooted in the consciousness of everybody—the idea that it is absolutely improper to speak to children about the question of sex. "Moreover, I stress the fact that this idea, considered so trifling by their naive Reason, and whose significance none of them grasps—regarding it simply as a question of 'decency' or 'indecency'—is the chief cause of their phenomenal psychic 'mechanicality.' "In the totality of fixed concepts which they call 'education,' there is even a certain section elucidating and designating exactly what is 'decent' and what is 'indecent' to say to children. "Toward the end of my last sojourn on the surface of your planet, I had to
study this painful terrestrial question in great detail.
"So that you may know approximately what results the contemporary education of children leads to, I will tell you about a certain incident which was the starting point of my special interest in this terrestrial misunderstanding. "This incident took place in the large community of Russia, but the story I am going to tell you is very characteristic and gives a good general picture of the education of children in contemporary civilization. "It is characteristic because in this large community of Russia, the
'responsible' beings, especially those of the ruling class, do their utmost to
bring up their children in exactly the same way as the 'responsible' beings of
the other contemporary communities on the continents of Europe and
America.
"Before telling you about this incident that evoked in me an impulse to acquaint myself specially with the question of the terrestrial education of children, I will tell you of something that occurred just prior to it, which admirably illus



trates the significance of this upbringing of theirs and which also served, as it
were, as a link in arousing my interest in that problem.
"I once happened to exist for a period of several months in the capital of this
community, the city of St Petersburg.
"During my stay there I became acquainted with an elderly couple.
"The husband was what is called a 'senator' and his wife was a member of
'high society' and a 'patroness' of several charitable organizations.
"I often used to visit them and enjoyed playing chess with the senator—a
customary pastime there among what are called 'respectable people. '
"This elderly couple had several daughters. "All the older daughters were already 'settled,' that is, married, only the
youngest, who was twelve years old, remained at home.
"As this couple had no further responsibilities toward their other
daughters, they decided to give this youngest daughter of theirs the best
possible education according to the notions of the time, and for this purpose
they sent her to a special 'boarding school,' a higher educational establishment
called an 'institute. '
"She came home only on Sundays and holidays, and regularly, once a
week, her father and mother used to visit her at the boarding school.
"As I almost always spent Sundays and holidays with them, I met this
charming, as yet unspoiled girl, and sometimes took walks with her in the
neighboring park.
"During these walks, we sometimes joked and sometimes she told me
about her lessons and her new impressions.
"These meetings and conversations, little by little, established a tie between us something like friendship.



"She was very alert in her perceptions and manifestations or, as your favorites themselves describe such persons, she was a 'lively and intelligent girl. ' "One day, my acquaintance, the senator, was sent on an 'inspection tour' somewhere far off in Siberia. "His wife wished to accompany him, as the senator was suffering from
what is called liver trouble and required constant care, but she could not go
with him because there would be no one to keep an eye on their youngest
daughter
"So, one morning, the parents, these elderly friends of mine, came to see
me at my apartment and asked whether I would agree to take their place with
their youngest daughter during their absence, that is, to visit her every week at
the institute and to bring her home with me for the holidays.
"Of course, I at once agreed to their proposal. "Soon afterward, the senator and his wife left for Siberia and I began
punctiliously fulfilling the obligations taken upon myself toward their
daughter, who by that time had become a pet of mine.
"On my first visit to this establishment, specially created for the education
of children, I noticed something strange that served as one of the causes of my
subsequent observations and studies of the consequences for your contem
porary favorites of that 'evil mischief' they invented themselves.
"On the day of my visit to this 'genteel establishment,' as they say, there
were many visitors in the reception room that was reserved for the meetings of
the parents or guardians with their children or wards
"Several parents had just come in, others were already talking with their
children, and still others sat waiting with all their attention fixed on the door
through which the pupils of the establishment usually entered.
"After I came into this reception room and explained to



the inspectress on duty who it was I wished to see, I too sat down to wait for
my chance foster child Meanwhile, I looked around.
"All the pupils of this 'genteel establishment' were dressed alike and all wore their hair alike, in two braids hanging down their backs, each one tied at the end with a ribbon. "What caught my eye was a certain peculiarity in these ribbons and braids.
"On some of the pupils the ribbons simply hung down their backs, but on the others the ends of these ribbons were tied together in a certain way. "On the very next holiday, when I brought my adopted child home, talking
at tea in front of the samovar, I asked her.
'Sonia, please tell me, why do the pupils of your institute—though they dress alike in everything else—have that peculiar difference in the ends of their braids?' "She immediately blushed and kept silent, pensively gazing into her tea, and then after a certain time replied nervously. " 'It's not just a simple thing with us. Although it is our big institute secret, I cannot help telling you about it as you are my friend, and I am absolutely sure that you will not give our big secret away to anybody '
"And she frankly told me the following: " 'The way we tie our ribbons was invented on purpose by the pupils so
that they could recognize one another; that is, know to which club a pupil
belongs, without the teachers or inspectresses, or anyone who is not a pupil of
the institute, knowing or suspecting the secret.
" 'All the pupils of our institute are divided into two categories, one category is what is called the 'men's club' and the other the 'women's club,' and we recognize one another by the way we tie our ribbons '



"And she went on to explain to me very specifically just what the difference was between these two clubs. "She said that as a rule all new arrivals at the institute were at first
members of the women's club, and only later, if any pupil proved to be daring
toward the teachers or in general showed herself very active in some way or
other, then by the common consent of all the pupils she was enrolled as a
member of the men's club, and from that moment on, tied the ends of the
ribbons of her two braids together.
" 'Our clubs sometimes meet in an empty classroom or dormitory, but
more often in the lavatories.
" 'A member of the men's club has the following privileges she has the
right to choose and order about as many as she likes of the members of the
women's club, and these latter are obliged to obey every whim of this member
of the men's club and do their utmost to make life in our boarding school easy
for her, for example, make her bed in the morning, copy her lessons, share
with her the presents coming from home, and so on and so forth.
" 'The chief occupation in the clubs consists of reading together forbidden
books procured by one of the pupils, principally one very rare manuscript
bought with money raised by general subscription This manuscript expounds
in detail the whole of the teaching of the famous poetess, Sapph. '
"I must tell you, my boy, that Sappho is the name of a certain Greek
poetess who was the first to discover there on your planet the 'way to real
happiness' for innumerable women of the Greco-Roman as well as of the
contemporary civilization.
"This great creator of 'women's happiness' had her dwelling place on the
island of 'Lesbos', and the name of this island was the origin of the title of
those women who have



become worthy to understand and carry out during the process of their
existence the teaching of this remarkable woman, and who at the present time
are called 'lesbians.'
"This adopted child of mine, who had by chance become my initiator into
the subtleties of the psyche of the beings of the female sex on your planet,
further explained to me that each pupil of the institute who was a member of
the men's club could choose for herself as many partners as she wished for the
common pastime—this of course being carried out in full accord with the
teachings of the poetess Sappho.
"Thanks to this one fact I have just related, out of thousands of other
observations of mine, I think you will clearly understand that this monstrous
phenomenon could not exist among the rising generation there if the notion
were not prevalent that it is exceedingly 'indecent' to talk to children about the
'question of sex.'
"This notion of 'decency' has come down to contemporary civilization as a
heritage from the beings of the epoch called the 'Middle Ages. '
"These candidates for hasnamusses of the Middle Ages, who were the
chief destroyers of the real meaning of the teaching of the divine teacher Jesus
Christ, also devised and introduced, as a rule of everyday existence, the
invention called 'bon ton ' And this maleficent invention became so strongly
rooted in the psyche of the majority from generation to generation that now
your favorites, who have become completely weak-willed, are unable,
however hard they try, to give up this abnormal psychic fixation, that is, the
notion that it is indecent to talk to their children about the 'question of sex. '
'What? Talk to one's children about sex? Is that not indecent?'
"The only things that the people of contemporary civilization teach their
children are the inventions collected by



various candidates for hasnamuss individuals in their manuals under the title of 'bon ton. ' "And since all these manuals say that it is very indecent to talk about the
sex question and, in the case of children, actually immoral, contemporary
people, even if they see their favorite son or daughter 'going to rot,' simply
cannot and, despite their 'mental wish,' dare not explain frankly to their
children the harmfulness and sin of these criminal habits.
"And so, my boy, soon after my friends, the senator and his wife, came back
from Siberia and I was free from the obligations I had taken upon myself
toward my pet, their youngest daughter, there took place the aforementioned
incident which served as the starting point of my special observations and
studies of this maleficent contemporary question.
"This sorrowful event occurred in St Petersburg, in another educational
institution of the same kind.
"The headmistress of this institute, finding that one of her pupils had
behaved contrary to their famous 'rules of decency,' reprimanded her so
harshly and so unfairly that, as a result, the accused and her friend—two
growing girls, having the germs of the data for becoming normal 'women
mothers'—hanged themselves.
"My investigations into this case brought the following to light.
"It seems that among the pupils of this establishment was a certain young
girl named Elizabeth, who had been brought by her parents from their distant
country estate to the capital in order that there, in this 'institution of higher
learning,' she might receive the most modern education.
"At the boarding school in St Petersburg, this thirteen-year-old Elizabeth
became great friends with another young girl, named Mary, who like herself
was not yet developed.



"That year on the day of the 'spring holiday' or, as it is otherwise called
there, 'May Day,' all the pupils of the institute were taken, according to
custom, on an outing into the country The two 'bosom friends' happened to be
in different groups which were walking at some distance from each other.
"Out in the fields Elizabeth happened to see not far off a certain quadruped
animal called a 'bull,' and not wishing her bosom friend, Mary, to miss seeing
this dear animal, she shouted, 'Mary! Mary! Look, there's a bull!'
"No sooner had she uttered the word 'bull' than all the what are called
mistresses swarmed around this poor Elizabeth, vehemently upbraiding her.
" 'How dare you utter the word "bull"! Don't you know that that quadruped
animal occupies itself with what no well-brought-up person would on any
account speak of, still less a pupil of such a genteel institute as ours?'
"While the mistresses were berating this poor Elizabeth, all the pupils of
the institute gathered around them, and the headmistress herself came up and,
having learned what it was all about, began in her turn to castigate Elizabeth.
'Shame on you!' she cried, 'Using a word considered so very, very
indecent.'
"At last Elizabeth could contain herself no longer and, bursting into tears,
she asked:
'But what should I have called that quadruped animal if it actually is a bull?' " 'The word you have used for that animal,' said the headmistress, 'is what
the riffraff call it. But you, since you are here in the institute, are no longer
one of the riffraff, so you should always find out how to call indecent things
by names that do not sound indecent to the ear.
'For instance, when you saw that indecent animal and wanted your friend to
look at it, you should have called,



"Look, Mary, there goes a beefsteak," or "Mary, look, there goes something that is very good to eat when we are hungry," and so forth. "All this made poor Elizabeth so distraught—especially as she was being
reprimanded in the presence of all her friends—that she could contain herself
no longer, and cried out with all her migh.
" 'Oh, you wretched old maids! Striped hobgoblins! Spawn of deepest hell!
Just because I called a thing by its name, you instantly begin to suck my
blood. Be thrice damned.''
"Whereupon she fainted, at which the headmistress herself fainted,
followed in turn by several class mistresses and inspectresses, who also
fainted.
"As for the class mistresses and inspectresses of this genteel institution
who had not fainted, they then raised such a hullabaloo as normally occurs
only in the town of Berdichev when the Jewish women are bargaining in the
marketplace.
"The upshot of it all was that when the class mistresses and inspectresses
who had fainted recovered their senses, they held what is called a 'teachers
council' then and there in the field, under the presidency of the headmistress,
and it was decided that immediately on their return to town, they would
telegraph Elizabeth's father to come for his daughter, as she was expelled from
the institute with loss of the right to enter any other similar institution in the
Russian Empire.
"That evening, an hour after the pupils returned, one of the porters of the
institute happened to find in the woodshed these two young, as yet
undeveloped future mothers, hanging by ropes fastened to the beams.
"In Mary's pocket a note was found with the following contents:



'I am heart and soul with my dear Elizabeth, and no longer wish to live with nonentities like you, so I am going with her to a better world.' "This case interested me so much that I began, privately of course, to investigate psychoanalytically, from every aspect, the psyche of all those taking part in this sad story. "I understood, among other things, that at the moment of her violent outburst, the psyche of poor Elizabeth was in a state of what is called 'chaos "And indeed it would have been astonishing if such 'chaos' had not existed in the psyche of this thirteen-year-old girl, not vet conscious of herself, who before this miserable event had always lived on her father's estate, where she had seen and felt the same richness of nature as on that day in the meadows near the city of St Petersburg. "She had been brought to that stifling, noisy city and had been kept shut up for a long time in an improvised cage. Then suddenly she found herself in an environment where every fresh impression awakened memories in her of all kinds of wonderful sensations. "On your planet, during the early days of spring there are sometimes scenes of almost irresistible loveliness Picture to yourself the following: "In the distance, cows are at pasture, nearby, at one's feet, snowdrops shyly peep out of the earth, a little bird flies by one's ear, on the right a quite unknown bird is singing, and on the left, the sense of smell is quickened by the perfume of some hidden flower. "In short, at a moment like this, a being as young as Elizabeth, finding
herself in the midst of such an abundance of all kinds of rich impressions after
a long period of oppressive existence in a suffocating city, would experience a
natural being-joy which aroused in her a whole world of associations.
"And Elizabeth must have felt this especially keenly, since



before attending the institute she had always lived, as I have already said, on her father's large estate, which lay far from the exceedingly abnormal conditions of urban life. "Thanks to this, every new impression would naturally call up in her earlier childhood memories, connected in their turn with various other pleasant impressions. "So it is not difficult to picture to yourself that the sudden appearance of that quadruped animal called 'bull,' reminding her of the one at home on the farm of her father's estate— and which had enjoyed the affection of all the children, who secretly even took it bread from the table—set off in this impressionable young girl an impulse for corresponding associations resulting in a feeling of sincere happiness, and since she was still unspoiled by the conditions of being-existence abnormally established there, she instantly wished to share her happiness with her bosom friend who was some distance off, and shouted to her to look at that dear 'bull.' "Now I ask you, what should she have called this quadruped being, since it actually was a bull? "Should it really have been 'beefsteak'? —as advised by the 'honorable' headmistress of this 'honorable' higher educational institution, created especially for the 'education of children' according to that barbarous system existing at the present time, to their misfortune.
"As you see, my boy, while intending to tell you somewhat more about the
three-brained beings breeding on the continent of North America, I have, by
the way, said a good deal about the three-brained beings arising and existing
on all the continents of that peculiar planet.
"I do not think you will hold this against me, however, since in this way you have learned many facts throwing light on the details of their strange psyche. "As regards the 'degree of degeneration' of the common presence of those who compose this large contemporary



group on the continent of North America, from the point of view of the
possibility of acquiring a being nearer to that of normal three-brained beings
in general, I can tell you something reassuring for them, which is that in my
opinion there remains among them the highest percentage of beings in whose
presence this possibility is not entirely lost.
"Although this new community is composed of a continually increasing
stream of three-brained beings coming from the continent of Europe—where
in order to find beings with such possibilities it is necessary, particularly in
recent times, to search specially, as our wise teacher Mullah Nasr Eddin says,
'with a high-powered electric arc lamp'—I repeat, there is a larger percentage
of such beings in America than on the continent of Europe.
"And it seems to me that this is because those who have migrated and
continue to migrate there from the continent of Europe are chiefly beings
from the 'common folk' and not the offspring of European beings belonging
to the ruling caste in whom, thanks to the predisposition to hasnamussian
properties transmitted by inheritance from generation to generation during
long centuries, so much 'inner swagger' exists at the present time that it would
never permit them to blend with the general mass in order to strive together,
with common efforts, to become such three-brained beings as they ought to
be.
"It was owing to the almost total absence of the offspring of the European
ruling caste among these American beings, and to the fact that as a mass they
formed a milieu in which it was still possible for members of our tribe to exist
without having to be exposed to emanations coming from surrounding beings
that have a harmful action on the 'subjectively natural inner forces' of every
being, that I was able, during my stay among them, to rest as I desired



"Now, my boy, since I have spent so much time explaining the meaning of all those pernicious customs that the beings of this large contemporary community have invented or restored, which had existed many times before on their planet and had proved injurious, in the objective sense, not only for themselves but also for all the other three-brained beings breeding on the other continents, it is in my opinion necessary, as so to speak a 'closing chord,' to initiate you also into the thoughts which began in my mentation on the last day of my sojourn among them in the city of New York, and ended on the steamer as it was moving away from that continent toward the east. "That day I was sitting in one of their peculiar cafés named 'Childs,' situated at what is called 'Columbus Circle,' waiting for the beings from the continent of Europe who had accompanied me to America to go with them to the dock of the outgoing steamer I was looking out of the window at the passers-by, who to an automatized perception seemed to differ in appearance—of course thanks chiefly to that baneful terrestrial invention recently fixed in them which they call 'fashion,' and by which they are more enslaved than the beings of any other continent—but who nevertheless somehow seemed to me, in respect of their 'inner content,' astonishingly alike. "While observing them I recalled my final conclusion of the day before,
and thought that in the present period of the flow of the Heropass, in the
common planetary process of ordinary existence of these strange three
brained beings, the beings of this new community represent the hotbed of the
intensive manifestation of that already long-established particularity in the
totality of their strange psyche, which one of the highest Sacred Individuals
once described as the periodic 'fundamental source from which issue new
causes of abnormalities.



"The shock for these associations and my further active reflections was the
observation I happened to make that what constitutes the 'overall subjective
appearance' of each of those three-brained beings such as clothes, gestures,
manners, and in general all the habits they acquire in the process of their
existence, is purely and simply an imitation of everything considered by the
'free' beings of other independent communities of other continents—'free' in
the sense that they have already experienced and consequently been dis
illusioned with everything the process of ordinary existence can give—as
unworthy of manifestation by beings similar to themselves.
"This accidental realization of mine astonished me very much, chiefly
because I had already reached the definite conclusion that, at the present
period, the beings of almost all the other communities on this planet, whether
newly formed or at an advanced stage, imitate to the full all the innovations of
the beings of this young community and enthusiastically adopt these
innovations in the process of their ordinary existence, and now it was clear on
the other hand that all the external manifestations of the beings of this new
group, and consequently the 'inner subjective evaluation' engendering these
manifestations, consist only in those bad habits which, as I have said, to the
great regret of the 'free' beings of the other independent groups, have become
fixed and inherent in the common presence of the ordinary beings of their
communities.
"This unexpected realization of mine aroused an impulse of intense
curiosity to clarify for myself the logical causes of this terrestrial incongruity
"All that day, while sitting in 'Childs,' awaiting the arrival of the beings
from the continent of Europe who had accompanied me, and while riding in
the taxi that took me to the dock, and also on the boat itself, I went on pon
dering this question very actively, of course appearing to



strangers to be looking automatically at everything proceeding around me. "As a matter of fact, while among your favorites on the planet Earth I
became an expert, indeed truly a 'virtuoso,' in behaving so as to appear like
them, and to pass unnoticed or, as they say, 'not to catch the eye. '
"Sitting on deck, and watching the twinkling of the lights on the shores of
that continent gradually growing fainter as the steamer moved away toward
the east, and pondering and comparing all the facts in their logical sequence, I
succeeded in making almost entirely clear to myself just why and how this
incongruity could have arisen on that ill-fated planet.
"To begin with, I established a number of facts that might have enabled
this incongruity to arise, but afterward, when I began, as is done in such cases,
to eliminate, one by one, all those that ensue logically from one another, I
eventually came upon a fact, insignificant at first glance, which to my
astonishment turned out to be the original cause of this abnormality.
"And I realized that this famous 'education' of theirs, so often mentioned by
me, inevitably engenders data in the common presence of each of them during
the period of their preparation for responsible existence—no matter to what
independent group he may belong—for the definite conviction that in former
epochs on their planet, beings similar to them had never perfected themselves
to that Reason which their contemporaries have attained and may even surpass.
"Concentrating my thoughts on this, and recalling all my former
impressions about this question, perceived both consciously and automatically
during my previous observations of your favorites, I gradually established that
all of them, particularly in the last thirty centuries, had become convinced
during their responsible existence that their contemporary 'civilization' is
simply the result of the direct



continuation of the development of their Reason, which began at the very
appearance of three-brained beings on their planet.
"And so when the beings of some group or other, owing to the formation in
them, while still in their preparatory age, of fresh data for this 'false
conviction,' accidentally come into possession of something regarded at the
time as desirable—which at once invests them with authority—and discover,
also accidentally, some idea that has existed many times in past epochs, they
pass it off and broadcast it as having been thought of by themselves Then the
beings of other groups, through the absence in them, due to wrong education,
of any data proper to all three-brained beings of responsible age that engender
in their presence an 'instinctive sensing of reality' and a 'broad outlook,'
believe that this 'something desirable' is appearing on their planet for the very
first time, and also that once this idea is applied in practice it will be really
very good And they forthwith begin to imitate the first group in everything,
both the good and the bad, even if it is completely contrary to all that exists
and is well fixed in their ordinary life, merely in order to possess what 'for
today' is considered desirable.
"I then even remembered that I had once before seriously reflected on this
subject during my fifth sojourn on the surface of your planet, when the city of
Babylon was considered the 'center of culture' of your favorites, and when, on
account of some similar question, I had to make a 'logical analysis' of this
strange feature of the psyche of these peculiar three-brained beings.
"Then, as now, I reasoned as follows: "This way of thinking could perhaps be justified by taking into
consideration that, owing to the abnormal conditions of ordinary existence
established in past epochs, no exact information reaches these three-brained
beings about events



that occurred in the past But how can one accept that there never arises in the
mentation of a single one of them—in whom, even today, there does
sometimes proceed 'something' similar to the process of 'confrontative
logic'—at least the following simple and, as they would call it, 'childish' idea?
"If—as they say themselves and are even convinced—their planet has
already existed many, many centuries with their species dwelling upon it, and
if before them many, many millions of beings similar to them, that is, beings
who could think, must also have arisen and existed, would there really not
have been among those many millions at least a few who could also have
invented all kinds of comforts for the well-being of their contemporaries,
such as the ones which these contemporary American beings are now
inventing and all the others are uncritically and even rapturously imitating
for example, comfortable seats in the water closets, preserved foods, and so
on and so forth.
"This unpardonable lack of thought is all the more strange in that they
themselves admit the existence of many 'ancient sages,' as they now call
them, and do not deny the wealth of information that has come down to them
concerning objective truths revealed by these sages, information which, by
the way, certain of your contemporary favorites, without any remorse of
conscience, are passing off as the product of their own thought and exploiting
to the full for their various egoistic aims, without at all suspecting that the
inevitable results of these wiseacrings of theirs will sooner or later lead their
descendants to total ruin.
"According to all my observations of them since the disappearance of the
continent of Atlantis, this peculiarity of their mentation, which is so difficult
to understand through any 'logical analysis,' by engendering in them the false
conviction I have spoken of, has always been, so to speak, the



'center-of-gravity cause' of almost all the unfortunate events, both large and small, in the process of their collective existence. "Thanks to this false conviction resulting from their strange mentation, and thanks also to the effect on the whole functioning of their feeling of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, which inevitably arise in their presence at responsible age and are called 'envy,' 'greed,' and 'jealousy,' it always happens there that when the beings of one group become the possessors of some 'innovation' which at that time is considered desirable, the beings of all the other groups, as soon as the rumor reaches them, immediately experience the desire to have the same thing, in most cases because of that maleficent habit fixed in their everyday existence which they express by the words 'never stand in the way of progress', and from that moment on, there arises in each of them, as I have already said, first the need to imitate the beings of that group and second the indubitable certainty that these beings must exist 'very correctly' since they have been able to acquire what is then regarded as desirable. "In this connection, the piquant strangeness of the mentation of your
favorites is that there never occurs in it the process called 'reflection,' whereby
they might understand, even if only approximately, the true reasons why some
beings possess that which evokes in others 'envy,' 'greed,' 'jealousy,' and so on.
"And so, my boy, although the beings of this new group have not acquired any of the results attained by the conscious labor and intentional suffering of the three-brained beings of past epochs and have absolutely nothing of their own, and their entire inner content, as well as their outer manifestations, consist only of everything bad that exists among contemporary beings of other independent groups, these latter now imitate to the full whatever is invented by the



beings of this new group solely because they have now accidentally become the possessors of just that which in the objective sense is most despicable, yet which, owing to the abnormal conditions of the ordinary existence of these unfortunates, is considered desirable.
"Of all the maleficent inventions of the beings of this contemporary community that has accidentally acquired authority, the most harmful for their common presence, that is, the one whose bad effects will be the most difficult to rectify in the future, is the custom they have established of passing a large part of the time of their existence in very high buildings. "In order that you may clearly understand the extent of the harm of this invention of theirs, I must first of all explain to you the following: "Do you remember that when I spoke to you about that 'maleficent practice' existing there at the present time called 'sport,' I said that, at the beginning, the duration of existence of these favorites of yours was 'fulasmtamnian,' that is to say, it was prolonged until their 'kesdjan body' was completely coated in them and perfected up to the required gradation of Reason, but that later, when very abnormal conditions of ordinary beingexistence began to be established there, Great Nature was constrained to actualize their presence and also the subsequent process of their existence according to the principle of 'itoklanotz,' that is, in conformity with the results of certain surrounding causes. "Ever since then, one of these causes has been the 'degree of density of
vibrations' of their second being-food or, as they themselves would say, the
'degree of concentration' of the air they breathe.
"The point is that this cosmic formation, which serves as the second food for beings, is also constituted according to the fundamental common-cosmic law of the sacred Tria



mazikamno, and thus is actualized by means of its three independent holy
forces, that is, three heterogeneous cosmic substances.
"The first is the emanation of the sun of that system in which this cosmic
formation serves as the second food for beings .
"The second are the substances transformed by the planet itself where the
beings who absorb this food exist.
"And the third are those substances which are transformed through the
other planets of this system, and reach this planet through their radiations.
"And so, the process of fusion of all the substances necessary for the
normal formation and existence of beings can proceed in the required
proportion in the atmosphere only within a certain distance above the surface
of the planet because, owing to the second-order cosmic law called 'tenikdoa'
or, as your favorites would call it, the 'law of gravity, ' the substances which
actualize the second holy force of the sacred Triamazikamno cannot penetrate
beyond a definite height in the atmosphere.
"In my opinion, you yourself can envisage all the consequences of what I
have just described, and assemble in yourself the data required for your own
opinion of the significance of this invention of theirs.
"I think that by now, my boy, I have fully satisfied your curiosity about these
'dollar fox-trotting followers' of their famous 'Christian Science. '
"In the name of Objective Justice it now only remains for me to remark
that whatever these Americans may be today, and whatever they may become
in the future, during the period I existed among them I had the possibility of
resting inwardly, and for this I now ought to express to them my sincere
thanks.
"And you, my heir, you who have been receiving and



will receive by inheritance everything acquired by me during my long
existence—of course only insofar as you yourself will deserve it by your own
conscious being-existence and honorable service to our Eternal All-Common
Father Maintainer, Our Endlessness—I command you, if you should happen
to be on the planet Earth, to visit without fail the city of New York or, if by
then this city no longer exists, then at least to stop at the place where it once
was, and pronounce aloud, with all your being.
" 'In this place, my beloved grandfather, my just teacher, Beelzebub,
passed a few agreeable moments of his existence.
"I charge you further—again, of course, as the heir on whom, as is usual,
will devolve the fulfillment of the obligations his predecessor took upon
himself and which, for some reason or other, were left unfulfilled—to pay
special attention to a question which greatly interested me but which I
personally was unable to elucidate, as it was still premature to do so, that is, I
charge you to find out what form, maleficent for their descendants—if, of
course, by that time their descendants continue to arise—has been taken by
the 'disease,' very widespread then, which one of their Misters, by the name of
Onanson, called 'writer's itch. '
"Indeed, my boy, having had a more or less close relationship with many
of them during my stay there, I soon found out that almost every one of them
either had already written a book, was just writing one at the moment, or was
getting ready to 'burst into print. '
"This peculiar 'disease,' prevalent among almost all the beings of this
continent, without distinction of age or sex, had assumed epidemic
proportions among the 'youth,' that is, those who are just at the beginning of
responsible age, particularly those with runny noses and many pimples on
their faces.
"In this connection you should take note that there flour



ishes among these beings one feature of the strange psyche of your favorites
which has become rooted in their collective existence and which may be
formulated thus 'the concentration of interest on any idea that has accidentally
become the question of the day. '
"And so some of them, who turned out to be a little more 'cunning' than the
rest, and in whom the data for the being-impulse called 'instinctively to refrain
from all manifestations which may lead one's fellow-beings into error' were
more atrophied, organized various 'schools' and composed all sorts of
'manuals,' in which they showed in detail just what the sequence of words
should be so that all written expositions should be better perceived and
assimilated by the reader.
"As a result, all those who attended these 'schools' or read these 'manuals,'
who were themselves in regard to being and to their knowledge of reality
exactly such types as our teacher, Mullah Nasr Eddin, refers to as 'nullities
emitting an atmosphere of unendurable vibrations,' began to wiseacre
according to all these rules And from then on, since the process of reading
had become an organic need of the beings of this new group, thanks to
various other abnormalities fixed in the conditions of their ordinary existence,
and since, moreover, it was possible to appreciate the contents of any work
only by reading it through, all the beings of this continent, seduced by every
kind of 'flashy' title, began to read and read, until finally it became definitely
noticeable that their mentation, already sufficiently 'diluted' without this,
became ever more and more 'diluted. '
"I was not speaking lightly when I said, 'if by that time their descendants
continue to arise,' because I then noticed the same extraordinary singularity
with regard to the new conformation of the planetary body of beings of the
female sex that I had once noticed long before in the process of the



ordinary existence of these strange three-brained beings, and parallel with
this, I carefully observed all its consequences.
"This curious phenomenon first occurred there before the loss of the
continent of Atlantis, in the process of existence of a small group of three
brained beings originating from various large communities of that time These
beings existed in isolation on the then famous island called 'Balakhanira,'
which was situated to the east of the continent of Atlantis, and was engulfed
within the planet at the same time as Atlantis itself.
"This small group died out owing to the same strange particularity of the
formation of the planetary body of the beings of the female sex, and the
manner in which the continuation of their species ceased was then called by
the learned members of the Society of Akhldanns 'dezsoop-sentozirosso
"This extraordinary phenomenon, which took place in the course of
several centuries before their race finally disappeared, was the gradual
narrowing of what is called the 'pelvis' in the beings of the female sex
"This progressive narrowing of the pelvis took place at such a rate that two
centuries before their race finally vanished, the 'appearance in God's world' of
their so to say haphazard conceptions was effected by the means then called
'sitrik,' and now called 'Caesarian section. '
At this point in Beelzebub's tales, a cross-current or eddy began in the ether
which penetrated the whole of the ship Karnak This signified that the
passengers were being summoned to the 'djamdjampal,' that is, the refectory
of the ship, where all the passengers assembled periodically to partake of the
second and the first being-foods.
So Beelzebub, Hassein, and Ahoon ended their conversation and hastened
to the djamdjampal.



CHAPTER 43
Beelzebub's survey of the periodic process
of the reciprocal destruction of men, or
Beelzebub's opinion of war
WHEN BEELZEBUB, Hassein, and Ahoon had returned from the "djamdjampal"
and had resumed their usual places, Hassein, turning again to his grandfather,
said:
"Dear Grandfather! Your thorough explanations of various episodes that
occurred during the process of existence of the three-brained beings on the
planet Earth have given me a clear idea and satisfactory understanding of the
surprising strangeness of their psyche; nevertheless, the question still arises in
me about one particularity of theirs which I cannot yet understand at all and
which, even taking into account the strangeness of their psyche, appears to
me illogical. My thoughts keep returning to this perplexing question and were
even concentrated on it during the holy sacrament in the djamdjampal.
"From all your explanations about the process of existence of these three
brained beings, I have seen very clearly that although most of them, during
their responsible existence, particularly since the third transapalnian
perturbation, have a purely automatic Reason, yet even with this automatic
Reason they can deliberate so well that they are able to determine, more or
less exactly, many of the laws of Nature on their planet, in accordance with
which they can even invent certain things on their own.
"At the same time, parallel with this, reminders of that particularity proper
to them alone—that is, the periodic need



to destroy one another's existence—run like a crimson thread through all your tales. "And so, dear Grandfather, I cannot understand at all how it happens that in spite of having existed for such a long time, they have never become aware and even now remain unaware of the horror of this property of theirs. "Don't they really ever see that of all the horrors that could possibly exist in the whole of the Universe, these processes are the most terrible? And don't they ever ponder on this matter so that they might become aware of this horror and find some means of eradicating it? "Please, Grandfather, tell me why this is so, and which aspects among all
those making up the strangeness of their psyche are the causes of this
particularity of theirs?"
Having said this, Hassein again looked at his grandfather expectantly, with an intense desire to know.
In response to this request of his grandson, Beelzebub looked at him steadily with a "smile full of remorse" and then, sighing deeply, he said
"Ekh! . . . my dear boy . . . "This particularity, with all the results ensuing from it, is the chief cause of all their abnormalities and of their so to say 'muddled logic ' "
Then after another short pause, he continued: "Good, I will help you to clarify this question—all the more as I have already promised to explain it to you in detail. "But, of course, for the sake of the development of your active mentation I
shall not give you my personal opinion on this subject, and will only present
the necessary material for logical confrontation in a way that could bring
about the crystallization in you of the data for your own individual opinion.
"By the way, you asked me if it is possible that they



never ponder on this abominable predisposition of theirs— inherent in them
alone.
"Of course they ponder, of course they see "Some of these three-brained
beings ponder very often and, in spite of the automaticity of their Reason,
fully understand that this predisposition to periodic reciprocal destruction is
such an unimaginable horror and so hideous that no name can even be found
for it.
"Unfortunately, this pondering of theirs leads to nothing "And it leads to
nothing because when certain isolated beings do think seriously about this
horror and come to some sensible conclusion, then because of the absence of
one common planetary organization for a single line of action, this view of
theirs is never widely spread and fails to penetrate into the consciousness of
other beings Incidentally, as far as this 'sincere pondering' is concerned, the
state of affairs among terrestrial beings is really lamentable.
"I must tell you that from the beginning of their responsible age, thanks to
the abnormally established conditions of being-existence, the 'waking psyche'
of each one of them has gradually become such that he can 'think sincerely'
and see things in a true light only if his stomach is so full of the first being
food that the 'wandering nerves' in it cannot move or, as they say, he is
'stuffed full,' and also if he has fully satisfied, of course only for that moment,
all the needs inherent in him, unworthy of three-brained beings, which have
become the dominant factors for the whole of his presence.
"Well then, owing to these same wrongly established conditions, not all
terrestrial beings have the possibility of satisfying these needs, and so, for this
and many other reasons, most of them, no matter how much they desire it, can
neither 'think sincerely' nor see and sense reality, and therefore 'sincere
thinking' and the 'sensing of reality' have long since



become a rare luxury on your planet and inaccessible to most of the beings there. "The only terrestrial beings there who have the possibility of being satisfied to repletion are those called 'important power-possessors', indeed, it is precisely these beings who because of their position could do something to eradicate this evil, or at least to diminish it to a certain extent. "But these 'important power-possessing beings,' who have the possibility of filling themselves to satiety and who could perhaps do something toward this end, in fact do nothing at all for quite other reasons. "And the fundamental reason is that same maleficent means fixed in the process of their ordinary being-existence which they call 'education ' "This maleficent means is applied there to all the young beings during their preparatory age, but especially to those who later on almost always become power-possessors. "Well then, since these future power-possessors do not make use of the time intended by Great Nature for the preparation of data for a worthy and responsible existence, but only waste it in developing in themselves the properties resulting from this celebrated education—which as a rule only dictates to them how best to give oneself up to what is called 'self-calming'when they become responsible and undertake to fulfill responsible obligations, they naturally have no data at all for manifesting 'logical reflection,' and prove to be incapable of any impartial relationship with those of their fellow-beings who come under their sway by virtue of surrounding conditions. "Owing to this abnormal education of theirs, nothing is deposited in them which would enable them to reflect and put anything effective into practice, but, on the contrary, many consequences of the properties of the for them accursed organ kundabuffer—devised by the great Angel, now



Archangel, Looisos—are gradually formed in them and, being transmitted by
heredity from one generation to another, crystallize in the psyche of these
unfortunates and become organic functions.
"The consequences most frequently met with today exist there under the
names of 'egoism,' 'partiality,' 'vanity,' 'self-love,' and so on.
"To describe the power-possessing or important beings there, our wise
Mullah Nasr Eddin has a very interesting saying:
'The importance of these people is measured exclusively by the number of their corns. '
"And so, my boy . . . "When the contemporary three-brained beings of your planet who can
afford to gorge themselves and to satisfy all their other needs, and perhaps
could do something to struggle against this phenomenal evil prevailing on
their planet, are fully satiated, and are reclining in what are called their 'soft
English armchairs,' in order, as is said there, 'to digest it all,' they do not even
take advantage of these favorable conditions for sincere thinking, but only
abandon themselves to their maleficent 'self-calming. '
"And since it is in general impossible for any three-brained being of the
Universe and therefore also for any of the beings of your planet to exist
without mentation taking place in them, and since, at the same time, your
favorites wish to be able to give themselves up freely to their 'inner evil god,
self-calming,' they have gradually and very efficiently accustomed
themselves to a sort of purely automatic thinking without the least being
effort of their own.
"One must give them their due—in this they have attained perfection, and
at the present time their thoughts flow in all directions without the intentional
exertion of any part of their presence.
"When, for instance, these important and power



possessing beings of the Earth, 'gorged and satisfied,' are reclining in their
armchairs, the associative thoughts which cannot stop flowing in them receive
impulses only from the reflexes of their stomach and sex organs and wander
freely in all directions, as they say there, 'to their heart's content,' as
nonchalantly as if these thoughts of theirs were 'strolling of an evening in
Paris along the Boulevard des Capucines.
"When one of these power-possessing beings of your planet is lolling in
his soft armchair, subjects like the following are a-thinking in him.
"For instance, 'How can I get even with my friend, John Smith, who a few
days ago looked at a woman I "love," not with his right eye but with his left?'
"Or this 'digesting' terrestrial power-possessor thinks, 'Why didn't my
horse come in first at the races yesterday, as I expected?'
"Or, 'Why do those worthless stocks keep going up day after day on the
market?'
"Or finally, he thinks something of this kind 'If only I were in John Smith's
shoes, who was smart enough to invent a new way of breeding flies and
making ivory out of their skeletons, with all the profits I would make, I would
do this, that, and the other, and not behave like that idiot who, like a dog in
the manger, neither eats himself nor lets others eat', and so on in the same
strain.
"However, it does occasionally happen that some important power-possessing
being of the Earth suddenly thinks, not under the influence of the reflexes of
his stomach and sex organs but sincerely and quite seriously about some
question relating to this terrifying terrestrial problem.
"But even the sincere reflections of the power-possessors occur for the
most part quite automatically, from casual outer causes, for instance, the
existence of someone very near to them is brutally cut short in the latest
process of



reciprocal destruction, or someone offends them deeply and painfully, or
someone touches their emotions by giving them something they either value
very highly or did not in the least expect, or finally, when they really feel their
own existence drawing to an end.
"In such cases, when these power-possessors ponder sincerely on this
terrible evil rampant on their planet they are always greatly agitated by it, and
while in this state, of course, they vow to undertake and carry out at all costs
everything necessary to put an end to this scourge.
"But here lies the misfortune no sooner do the stomachs of these 'sincerely
agitated' beings become empty or no sooner do they recover a little from those
disheartening outer impressions than they not only forget their vow but again
begin, consciously or unconsciously, to do everything that generally causes
the outbreak of these processes between communities.
"It very often happens that these power-possessing beings, unintentionally
or even half-intentionally, do everything to hasten the outbreak of the next
process of reciprocal destruction, and even dream of it taking place on as large
a scale as possible.
"And this monstrous need arises in their abnormal psyche because they
expect certain egoistic profits from these processes, and with their degenerate
mentation, even hope that the greater the scale of the process, the greater the
profits will be for themselves or for their relatives.
"However, it sometimes happens there, my boy, that certain of these important
power-possessing beings unite and form a special society with the aim of
jointly finding and putting into practice some means of abolishing this arch
criminal particularity of theirs.
"Just as I was leaving that solar system forever, there was again a great deal of
talk on your planet about forming such



a society, and it seems that they were intending to call it the 'League of Nations.' "I say 'again' because many times before they had formed similar societies which in the end always died in the same strange way—that is, they always died without any 'death agony.' "I remember very well the first time such a society arose there. It was in the city of 'Samoniks' in the country of Tikliamish, which was then regarded as the chief 'center of culture' for all the three-brained beings of this peculiar planet of yours. "Then for the first time important beings from most of the communities of the continent of Asia assembled in that city with the aim of drawing up a common agreement, so that among the different Asiatic communities there would never again arise any cause whatever for the process of reciprocal destruction. "This society had as its motto: 'God is where man's blood is not shed.' "But owing to their various personal egoistic and vainglorious aims, these important terrestrial power-possessors who had assembled soon quarreled among themselves and went their ways without accomplishing anything. "Several centuries after the existence of Tikliamish a similar society arose on the continent of Asia, this time in the country then called 'Mongolplanzura.' "And this society had the motto: 'Love one another and God will love you "This society, having given no positive result for the same reasons, also ended its existence in the same way. "Later a similar society was formed in the country today called 'Egypt,' and it began its existence with the motto: 'Only if you learn to create a flea can you dare to kill a man.' "Still later, another society was founded in the country of 'Persia,' and the following sentence was taken as its motto:



'All men are divine, but if a single one is killed by another, then all will be
reduced to nothing.'
"And quite recently, barely four or five of their centuries ago, the last such
society was formed, also on the continent of Asia, in the city that was called,
it seems, 'Mosulopolis.' At its arising this society was named 'The Earth
Belongs to Our Common Creator and Is Equally Free for All His Creatures.
"But shortly afterward, when some dispute broke out among its members,
they renamed their society, and later it ended its existence under the new
name of 'The Earth Belongs Only to Men. '
"The members of the society, 'The Earth Is Equally Free for All,' might
perhaps have accomplished something effective because, in the first place,
they had a feasible program as the basis of their aims, and second, they were
all, without exception, old and honorable beings who had had a great deal of
experience and in consequence had become disillusioned about everything
that ordinary planetary existence could in general give them.
"And owing to this, they had fewer properties such as 'egoism,' 'vanity,'
and so on, which usually cause societies of this sort to collapse.
"But the main reason why something useful might have come out of this
society was that there was not a single power-possessing being in it, not one
of these beings who, driven by their egoistic and vainglorious aims, sooner or
later dispatch—moreover with 'musical accompaniment,' as they say—all the
achievements of the common planetary society of which they happen to be
members to the famous swine of our Mullah Nasr Eddin, which always
gobble up everything, without what are called 'parlor manners.'
"The only public affairs that these important terrestrial power-possessing
beings, particularly the contemporary ones, do not obstruct are those from
which they might ex



pect substantial profit either for themselves personally or for other beings of their caste. "The tasks undertaken by this kind of society might have good results for
all the beings of their planet without distinction of caste, but as soon as any
difficulties arise in its affairs or, as is said, 'the first small crisis appears,'
these tasks immediately become too boring for the terrestrial power
possessors and at the mere mention of them, or when they remember them by
association, expressions of martyrdom appear on their faces.
"So nothing resulted from the labors of those beings who called their
society 'The Earth Belongs to Our Common Creator and Is Equally Free for
All His Creatures,' although they did almost everything that could possibly be
done in the conditions that usually prevail on that incomparable planet I shall
tell you about this a little later and even in some detail, because the
information concerning the downfall of that very society, formed by your
favorites in their attempt to eradicate or at least diminish this 'arch-criminal
property' implanted in them, will throw more light on the strangeness of their
psyche and at the same time help you to understand to a certain extent the
chief objective causes of these terrifying processes of reciprocal destruction
among them.
"And now as regards the contemporary society, which as I told you has just
been formed with the same aim of jointly finding and putting into practice the
measures needed to bring these terrifying processes on their planet to an end,
and which is called the 'League of Nations'—if you wish to know my sincere
opinion, I am more than sure that this time also nothing effective will come of
it, for two reasons.
"The first reason will become clear to you only at the end of this narrative,
and the second is that this 'criminal property' has already entered into the
'flesh and blood' of the



three-brained beings of the planet Earth And since nothing could be
accomplished by your favorites of earlier epochs who on reaching responsible
age had at least attained, in respect of being, to what is called 'self
remembering,' it is all the more certain that nothing effective can be devised
or actualized by beings who possess a Reason no different from that of most
of their contemporaries, and who in respect of being are perfected only to the
degree defined by our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin in the following words :
" 'Look! Look! He already begins to distinguish mama from papa!'
"Still, I must remark that even though these contemporary important
power-possessing beings who are or will be members of this new society will
not achieve anything consciously, they will unconsciously obtain from this
undertaking of theirs a considerable and most useful 'advantage' for
themselves personally, because this official society of theirs will provide them
with still another very plausible excuse for pulling the wool over the eyes of
what are called their 'proprietresses,' which for a contemporary terrestrial
being means his 'wife,' 'mistress,' 'mother-in-law,' or even some 'saleslady' in
one of their large stores, and so on.
"Thanks to this new official 'gold mine' of theirs, they will have the
opportunity of passing the time quietly with their friends, important power
possessing beings like themselves, and of attending the 'cocktail parties' that
will doubtless be arranged very often for affairs ostensibly connected with the
aims of this important society of theirs, far from the 'silent but terrible' glances
of their ever-watchful proprietresses .
"Usually, these societies of power-possessing beings arise toward the end
of one of the great processes of reciprocal destruction, and almost always in
the following way :
"Since a number of these power-possessors personally suf



fered 'grievous losses' during the last process, these losses continue by momentum to influence their common presence, and engender in the general functioning of their psyche a certain combination whereby the data in their subconscious for the arising of the being-impulse named 'conscience' begin spontaneously to take part in the functioning of the 'automatic consciousness' that has long since become habitual to them, that is to say, there arises of itself in their common psyche that combination dreamed of by the Most Saintly Ashiata Shiemash for all the three-brained beings of that ill-fated planet. "Well then, my boy, when these power-possessing beings meet and discuss
this terrible property of theirs at length, they gradually see it almost in its true
light, and a sincere desire appears in them to do their utmost to achieve the
abolition of this appalling horror which has been proceeding on their planet.
"And so, if several of these terrestrial power-possessors with a 'resurrected conscience,' who see and feel reality almost in its true light, happen to meet often enough to exert a lasting influence on one another, they then unite in order jointly to discover some possibility of fulfilling these sincere wishes of theirs. "And it is usually in this way that such societies there begin.
"Perhaps these beings in one way or another would achieve some good
results, but the trouble is that very soon, as a rule, other important power
possessing beings join such societies and begin to take part in them.
"And they join and take part in the tasks of these societies not because their conscience begins to speak—far from it— but simply because, being themselves 'important' and 'power-possessing,' they must, according to the abnormally established conditions of ordinary being-existence, become members of every 'important' society.



"Well then, when these other terrestrial important and power-possessing
beings enter such societies and begin to participate in their affairs with their
personal, egoistic, and vainglorious aims, they very soon 'throw overboard' all
the tasks and everything accomplished by the beings with a resurrected
conscience, and also put genuine 'spokes into the wheels' of the original
founders of these societies.
"And that is why these societies, founded for the common planetary
welfare, always die quickly and, as I have already told you, without any death
agony.
"As for the practical results of all the good beginnings of these important
beings, our worthy Mullah Nasr Eddin has another very wise saying
'Past centuries have shown that Karabaghian asses never sing like
nightingales, nor will they ever refrain from indulging their noble taste for real
Shooshoonian thistles.
"Here I think it will be opportune for you to know that, during my long
centuries of attentive observation of the three-brained beings of the planet
Earth, I never once noticed, among the members of the societies founded from
time to time for devising means to assure the happy existence of the masses,
any beings with more or less Objective Reason, although, as I have already
told you, a certain number of your favorites did attain this result by their
persevering efforts toward self-perfection.
"In the course of the observations I made during my last sojourn there I
cleared up, among other things, why it is that beings with Objective Reason
never belong to such societies.
"The point is that to belong to one of these societies a being must of
necessity be 'important' and, in the abnormally established conditions of
being-existence, only he is considered 'important' among them who has either
a great deal of money or who becomes what is called 'famous. '
"And since during recent times only those can become



famous and important in whom the sacred function called 'being-Conscience' is entirely absent, and since this sacred function in the presence of beings is always connected with everything that represents and is Objective Reason, those three-brained beings who have Objective Reason always have Conscience as well, and therefore will never be 'important' among the other beings there. "And that is why beings with Pure Reason never had and never will have the possibility of taking part in societies consisting of 'important' powerpossessing beings. "In short, we can apply to this question what our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin once said, namely 'This is the ultimate punishment pull at the tail and the mane gets stuck, pull at the mane and the tail gets stuck. ' "Be that as it may, as I have already said, your contemporary favorites again wish to find possible ways and means of abolishing this terrible property that has become rooted in their psyche as firmly as the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer. "And of course, these members of the contemporary society called the
'League of Nations' will endeavor to achieve this by all kinds of regulations
and agreements devised by them, similar to those tried out by the beings of
ancient times, that is to say, by ways and means through which, in my
opinion, it is absolutely impossible to achieve anything effective.
"This undertaking of your contemporary favorites could have some
advantages, but only for their inevitable newspapers, for drawing-room
conversations, and of course for numerous hasnamussian manipulations by
those they call 'speculators on the stock market. '
"At the present time, in regard to this terrible evil, the state of affairs is such that the immediate total destruction on the surface of your planet of this hideous property which, as I said, has already entered their flesh and blood is not only



a senseless task for their miserable Reason, but is in general almost impossible.
"However, my boy, although the members of this contemporary common
planetary society called the 'League of Nations' are entirely lacking in
impartial Reason, such as is proper to the presence of all three-brained beings
of responsible age, nevertheless, even they could perhaps achieve positive
results in their fundamental aim if they were to occupy themselves only with
solving those problems that are within the scope of their competence and
powers.
"But knowing their 'ways,' I am quite sure that they will not occupy
themselves with questions that are within the reach of their understanding.
"They would like to do, and would do, anything whatever in order that
these 'processes of reciprocal destruction' should cease immediately and
forever.
"But if with all their being they became aware of the whole objective
horror of these processes and sincerely desired to eradicate this evil from the
surface of their planet, they would willy-nilly penetrate into the very essence
of the problem and understand that an inherency fixed in the psyche for
hundreds of centuries can never be decrystallized in the course of a few
decades.
"If they understood this, they would not attempt to decide, let alone carry
out, anything of this kind for the welfare of their contemporaries, but would
devote all their attention, all their powers, and all their possibilities to working
solely for the welfare of beings of future generations.
"For instance, instead of wiseacring or, as is said there, 'playing at Don
Quixote' by aiming to stop these processes at one stroke, they might occupy
themselves with uprooting the belief, now established in their everyday
existence, in the validity of two concepts first of all, they could try to put an
end to the practice of exalting certain participants in these processes to the
rank of 'hero' and rewarding them



with honors and 'decorations', and second, they could try to abolish at least
that famous branch of their 'hasnamussian sciences,' invented by some
'pimpled' beings among them, which airily proves that periodic reciprocal
destruction on the Earth is absolutely indispensable, for without it there would
be an intolerable overpopulation, causing such economic turbulence that men
beings would begin eating one another.
"If they were to succeed in abolishing the first of these two concepts
already firmly fixed in the process of their abnormal ordinary being-existence,
they would destroy forever the greater part of those 'automatic factors' which
predispose the psyche of the growing generation always to fall into that
particular state habitual to them during these processes And as for getting rid
of the second, this would help to keep at least one of those innumerable
idiotic ideas from reaching the beings of future times—ideas which are con
stantly arising there and, transmitted from generation to generation as
incontestable 'articles of faith,' in large measure cause the formation in their
presence of certain properties, not one of which is becoming to three-centered
beings of our Great Megalocosmos Among these properties is the one
inherent in them alone that even makes them 'doubt the existence of divinity',
and chiefly because of this doubt there has almost entirely disappeared from
their common presence even the possibility of the precipitation of certain data
that should infallibly be deposited in the presence of all three-brained beings,
the totality of which engenders in them the impulse called the 'instinctive
sensing' of certain cosmic truths that are always felt even by all one-centered
and two-centered beings everywhere in the whole Universe.
"But to the misfortune of all the other ordinary beings, these important
power-possessors assembled from the whole of the planet do not occupy
themselves with these questions, considering them beneath their dignity.



"What next! How could 'important' members of such an 'important' society suddenly concern themselves with such trivial matters.' "In general, since the data for individual manifestation have completely ceased to be crystallized in most of these three-brained beings who have taken your fancy, and since they manifest themselves only according to the dictates of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer, they do not like to occupy themselves with matters within their Reason and power, but are interested solely in resolving questions that are incomparably higher than their Reason.
"Owing to this 'feature' of their strange psyche, another very peculiar 'psychoorganic' need has been formed in them during the last twenty centuries. "The chief manifestation of this psycho-organic need of theirs consists in this, that each of them feels absolutely obliged, as they say, 'to teach others sense' or 'to put them on the right road. "Do you know, my boy, in speaking of this unusual feature of their character, inherent in all of them without exception, it occurs to me that it would be desirable at this point to give you some advice about their strange psyche, like that which our good old Ahoon gave you at the end of my explanations of their famous contemporary terrestrial 'art. ' "He advised you, among other things, that if for some reason or other you should happen to exist on the planet Earth and mix with those strange threebrained beings, you should always be very careful with the contemporary types who are 'representatives of art,' in order not to offend them and make 'mortal enemies' of them. "At that time, our dear Ahoon, having in mind their numerous weaknesses
such as 'self-love,' 'pride,' 'vanity,'



and many others, indicated to you just which of these specific properties it was necessary to 'tickle,' as he expressed it, in each case. "He even explained to you in detail how to speak to them and what had to
be said so that they would always be well disposed toward you and always
and everywhere praise you and say nothing but good about you.
"I have nothing against this advice of his, it cannot be denied that it is ideal for the types he mentioned. "The contemporary 'representatives of art' are indeed amply provided with
the specific properties enumerated by our dear Ahoon, and if you know how
to 'tickle' these properties on every possible occasion, they will indeed 'adore'
you and behave toward you like true 'Asklaian slaves.’
"But although this advice of his is excellent and even indispensable for
those who wish to exist among them, I personally do not consider it practical
for you, first, because not all the beings of the Earth are 'representatives of art'
and this advice does not apply to all of them without exception, and second,
because it would be irksome for you to have to remember all these numerous
properties and to stop each time and think which of these numerous
weaknesses must be 'tickled' and on which occasion.
"So I wish to point out to you one great 'secret' of their psyche, that is, one
property of theirs which, if you know how to make use of it, will produce in
each of them the manifestation that Ahoon was speaking of.
"If you act upon them by means of this property, not only will you be on
very good terms with all of them but if you wish, thanks to this secret of their
psyche, you will even be able fully to ensure your happy and peaceful exis
tence, both as regards 'money,' which is a necessity there, and other
conveniences whose taste and blissful significance our dear teacher expresses
by the words, 'a bed of roses.'
"No doubt, my boy, you have already guessed that the



secret I am referring to is this 'psycho-organic need' of theirs 'to teach others
sense' and 'to put them on the right road. '
"This specific property formed in their psyche, thanks as always to the
abnormally established conditions of ordinary being-existence, inevitably
becomes as it were an integral part of their presence when they reach
responsible age.
"Everyone there, without exception, has this psycho-organic need old and
young, men and women, and even those they call 'misbegotten.'
"This singular need arises in its turn from another property of theirs which
is that each of them, from the moment he acquires the capacity to distinguish
'wet' from 'dry,' carried away by this achievement, ceases forever to see and
observe his own abnormalities and defects, but only sees and observes these
same abnormalities and defects in others .
"At the present time it has become customary there for every one of your
favorites to teach others like himself things that he hasn't the faintest idea
about, even in his dreams And the joke of it is that if 'others' do not listen to
him, or at least do not pretend that they are listening to him, he is not only
offended but even inwardly sincerely indignant, on the other hand, if 'others'
should learn 'sense' from him, or at least pretend that they are very eager to do
so, he will not only 'love' and 'respect' them but will himself be filled with
satisfaction and delight And it is only in these circumstances that your
favorites can speak about others without hate or criticism.
"And so, my boy . . . "I strongly advise you that if for any reason you have to exist among them,
always pretend that you wish to learn something from them Act in the same
way toward their children and you will then not only be on excellent terms
with them all, but the whole family will look on you as the most honored
friend of the house.
"Always remember that because of the self-conceit flow



ing from this particular property, any one of them, however insignificant he
may be in essence, looks down with contempt upon the attitudes and conduct
of others, especially if their attitudes and conduct sharply contradict his own
subjective views, and in these cases, as I have just said, he usually becomes
inwardly sincerely offended and indignant.
"I might as well remark here that this property of your favorites of always
growing indignant at the defects of others around them makes their own
existence, already wretched and abnormal without this, objectively
unbearable .
"Because of this constant indignation, the ordinary being-existence of
these unfortunates almost always flows accompanied by unproductive 'moral
sufferings', and these futile 'moral sufferings' of theirs usually continue by
momentum to act for a long time on their psyche 'semtzektzionally' or, as they
would say on your planet, 'oppressively', in other words, they ultimately
become 'instruarnian,' or 'nervous,' of course without the participation of their
consciousness .
"And then, in the process of their ordinary being-existence, they became
completely 'uncontrolled,' even in being-manifestations which have nothing to
do with the primary causes of this 'instruarness' or 'nervousness' of theirs
"And it is just this property of being 'indignant at the defects of others' that
has gradually made their existence arch-tragicomic.
"For instance, at every step there you can see a picture of this sort.
"One of these freaks, having lost the only thing they acquire from their
maleficent 'education,' which they call a 'mask,' behind which they cunningly
hide from others their obvious inner and outer defects, has fallen as they say
completely 'under somebody's thumb. ' Well then, this being who is 'under the
thumb' of his wife or his mistress—or of



somebody else who has 'ferreted out' his inner insignificance—and has
become the slave of one of these 'patrons' to the point of humiliation, waxes
more indignant than anyone if some king, for some reason or other, is unable
to keep tens or hundreds of thousands of his subjects under control.
"And oddly enough, it is precisely such 'terrestrial humbugs' under
somebody's thumb who usually write all sorts of manuals expounding in
detail what must be done to 'govern' others well.
"Or again, if one of these contemporary beings, whose heart always 'sinks
into his boots' when a mouse runs past him, learns that so and so was a bit
scared on meeting a tiger, this 'hero' will be filled with indignation against
him and, 'foaming at the mouth,' will not fail to denounce him to his friends,
proving that he is a criminal coward for having been frightened by a 'mere
tiger.
"And here again the various books and manuals concerning what must be
done and how, and what must not be done on meeting a tiger or other such
being, are written by these 'mouse-flinching heroes. '
"Or further, one of these beings who has collected a score of 'chronic
diseases,' so that his stomach does not work for weeks at a stretch and his
whole body is covered with every kind of loathsome pimple, from all of
which he naturally suffers day and night—in short, a being who for many
years has been a genuine 'walking anatomical museum' of all the diseases
existing on that planet—is always more indignant than anyone else when
someone is careless enough to catch, let us say, a cold in the head.
"And these 'walking anatomical museums' invariably instruct others with
great authority on how to get rid of such a cold, and it is they who write all
sorts of books and manuals on the multitude of diseases there and expound in
minute detail their prevention and cure.



"At every step, one can observe an absurdity of this kind: one of them who
does not have the slightest idea what the ordinary tiny being called 'flea,'
which often bites him, really looks like, writes a huge volume or organizes
'public lectures,' as they are called, to explain that the flea whose bite caused a
swelling on the neck of a certain king known in history as King Naookhan,
had on its left paw an 'abnormal, orange-crimson growth of a very odd form.'
"Well then, this 'flea expert' who writes his voluminous work about the
'orange-crimson growth' on the flea whose bite caused King Naookhan's
venerable neck to swell, or spends a whole evening lecturing on this subject,
will not only be offended but even greatly indignant if anyone expresses
doubts to his face; and he will be indignant chiefly because this person is such
an 'ignoramus' that he has never even heard about the 'truths' communicated
by this 'expert.'
"To satisfy that astonishingly strange psycho-organic need to teach others,
your favorites, in order not to suffer, must always have at least one 'victim' for
instruction, but in those who for some reason or other have acquired a certain
authority in these manifestations, and who by prolonged habit have become
more brazen, the appetite grows and requires an always greater number of
these victims.
"And so, my boy, if a normal being existing there were to observe such
pictures that are met with at every step and seriously ponder his own
perceptions, he might acquire full knowledge of all branches of Objective
Science.
"Moreover, if one day you should ever happen to exist among them and
witness these incongruous being-manifestations, you will be unable, in spite
of knowing their cause, to keep from 'laughing' inwardly. At the same time
you will pity these unfortunates with the whole of your being, and your 'inner
laughter' will gradually be suffused with what is called 'essence-palnassoorian
grief.'
"This property of the psyche of the three-centered beings



there is especially strongly developed among the beings belonging to the caste called the 'intelligentsia.' "The word 'intelligentsia' conies very close to the idea we define by the
expression 'force in oneself.'
"Although in its essence the word 'intelligentsia' has had this meaning for
centuries, your contemporary favorites, without the slightest embarrassment,
use it to designate those beings who are the exact opposite of what the word
denotes.
"The word 'intelligentsia' is taken from the ancient Greek language.
"It is interesting to note that this word was also used by the ancient
Romans who, having borrowed it from the Greeks, not for its sense but for its
sound, later imagined that its root belonged to their own language.
"But among the ancient Greeks this word denoted beings so perfected that
they could direct their functions by their own will, unlike nonspiritualized
cosmic formations, whose actions are only reactions to external causes.
"It is true that one still meets beings on your planet who correspond
approximately to the real meaning of this word, but only among beings
regarded as 'not intelligent. '
"In my opinion, if the beings who are now called the 'intelligentsia' were
simply called the 'mechanogentsia,' this would perhaps be more correct.
"And it would be more correct not only because the contemporary
intelligentsia can give absolutely no direction at all to their being-functions,
but also because there are already completely atrophied in them even those
data for impulses of essence-initiative for daily being-existence which Great
Nature always puts in all three-centered beings at their arising.
"During their responsible existence these beings belonging to the
intelligentsia manifest themselves, that is to say, act automatically, only on
receiving accidental or intentional shocks from outside, and it is only these
external shocks that



animate them and bring them corresponding experiences, thanks to the
unrolling of a series of associations linked with accidental, automatic
impressions already perceived by them and not depending at all on their own
wish or will.
"These external shocks usually come, in the first place, from animate or
inanimate objects that accidentally enter the field of perception of their visual
organs, second, from all sorts of beings they meet, third, from the sounds or
words reverberating where they happen to be, fourth, from odors accidentally
perceived by their sense of smell, and finally, from unaccustomed sensations
experienced by them from time to time in the functioning of their planetary
body or, as they say, their 'organism'—and so on.
"But never do their outer manifestations or the inner being-impulses that
ought to be under the direction of their 'being-I' proceed according to their
own wish arising from their entire presence.
"I must tell you further that for various reasons some of those terrestrial
beings belonging to the intelligentsia, whose psychic manifestations have
undergone definite changes in the course of their responsible existence, are no
longer called 'intelligentsia' by other terrestrial beings but are given different
names composed of different words or, more exactly, roots of words taken
from the ancient Greek, such as
Bureaucrats Plutocrats Theocrats Democrats Zevrocrats Aristocrats
and so on "The first of these names, that is, 'bureaucrat,' is given to the beings of the 'intelligentsia' in whom the series of



automatic associations already present in them, and which engender definite
experiencings, are limited in number, that is, however varied the shocks
coming from outside may be, they always evoke in these bureaucrats
associations of the same experiencings which, thanks to frequent repetition,
acquire their own specific character and manifest themselves quite
independently, without the participation of any of the separate spiritualized
being-parts of their common presence.
"And as for the second of these names, that is, 'plutocrat,' this is applied to
those beings of the 'intelligentsia' who, also after a certain transformation of
their psyche, very artistically succeed during the period of their responsible
existence in getting into their toils all the honest, that is, 'naive,' fellow
countrymen they encounter, with the result that they become the owners of a
large quantity of what are called 'money' and 'slaves.'
"Bear in mind, in this connection, that it is from just these terrestrial types
that most hasnamuss individuals arise.
"During my sojourn on the planet Earth, while investigating the questions
that interested me, I chanced to learn the secret of the origin of this word
'plutocrat. '
"As I have already told you, for the last twenty-five centuries every
dubious notion and every suspicious thing there for some reason or other has
been called by an ancient Greek word, thus these names also, such as
'bureaucrat,' 'aristocrat,' 'democrat,' and so on, which express dubious notions,
are composed of two ancient Greek words.
"The word 'bureaucrat,' for instance, consists of two words 'bureau,' which
means 'office,' and 'crat,' which means 'to keep' or 'to hold. '
"And together these words mean 'those who keep or manage the whole
office. '
"And as regards the word 'plutocrat,' it seems that the



history of its origin is somewhat different and does not go back very far
"This word was formed only seven or eight of their centuries ago. "Although these types also existed in ancient Greece they were then called
'plusiocrats. '
"Several centuries ago, however, when beings of this type had multiplied,
and it became clear that the other beings of the Earth had to exalt them with
some sort of title, certain of those who at that time were in charge of such
questions invented for them this name of 'plutocrat. '
"It seems that they deliberated and pondered a long time before adopting
this name, because they understood very well that these types on their planet
are scoundrels of the deepest dye, and are, so to speak, 'saturated to the
marrow of their bones' with every kind of hasnamussery, and therefore a name
had to be found that would fit them to perfection.
"At first these beings in charge wished to 'exalt' them with some title
corresponding to their inner significance, but on reflection, they were afraid to
do this, because these terrestrial types, thanks to their 'ill-gotten gains,' had
acquired 'force' and 'power' perhaps greater than that of their kings, so they
were afraid that if they 'exalted' them by a title that would indicate their real
significance, they would be deeply offended and begin to do still more harm
to those around them So in the end, they decided to be cunning and invented a
word thanks to which they could call them by their real name, yet at the same
time appear to do them honor.
"They achieved this in the following way: "As the title for these terrestrial types had, of course, to be composed of
two ancient Greek words and, as all such names end with the Greek word
'crat,' they left this ancient



Greek syllable as the second half, in order that the new word might not be too
obvious.
"The first half of this word, however, was not taken from the ancient
Greek, as was usually done, but from the Russian language They took the
word 'plut,' which in Russian means 'rogue,' and thus obtained 'plutocrat.'
"These wise terrestrial beings indeed attained their aim to perfection,
because at the present time everyone is quite satisfied with this title—these
parasites themselves as well as all the other beings of the Earth.
"Indeed, these terrestrial monsters are so satisfied with their title that they
swagger about in top hats, even on weekdays.
"And the other terrestrial beings are also satisfied, because they call these
monsters by their real name, not only without making them angry but even
causing them to strut like 'turkey-cocks.'
"As regards the third of the names I enumerated—that is, 'theocrat'—this
title designates those members of the intelligentsia in whose common
presence there occurs almost the same 'perturbation,' in the psycho-organic
sense, as in those who become 'plutocrats.'
"The only difference between the plutocrats and the theocrats is that to
satisfy their hasnamussian needs, the former act upon those around them
through the function they call 'trust', while the latter act upon the function
which in your favorites has gradually replaced the sacred function that serves
all the three-brained beings as one of the three sacred paths for self
perfecting, that is to say, 'faith.'
"To give you a better idea of the difference between these theocrats and
plutocrats, it will be enough to quote another saying of our highly esteemed
Mullah Nasr Eddin:
"While speaking one day of the many forms of authority which influence man's psyche, suddenly, without rhyme or reason, he said:



" 'What does it matter to the poor flies how they are killed—by a kick from the hoof of a horned devil or the brush of the beautiful wings of a divine angel?' "As for the terrestrial types whom all the others call 'democrats,' I must tell
you that they do not always come from the 'intelligentsia' by heredity, most of
them start out as simple ordinary beings and only later, having insinuated
themselves by some 'tour de force' into that class, are they transformed into
'democrats.'
"During the process of their transformation, the degeneration of the
functions issuing from the sacred function of Conscience brings about almost
the same results in them as in the plutocrats and theocrats.
"Here it might as well be remarked that when some of these democrats, for
one reason or another, happen to occupy the posts of 'power-possessing
beings,' their actions sometimes produce a very rare cosmic phenomenon, as
Mullah Nasr Eddin says, 'the very corns turn into podiatrists.'
"This rare phenomenon occurs, in my opinion, because the democrats who
chance to occupy the posts of power-possessing beings have no inherited
aptitude for knowing instinctively how to govern others, and are consequently
quite unable to direct the existence of beings who happen to be under their
authority.
"As regards these terrestrial types, our priceless teacher Mullah Nasr Eddin
has another appropriate saying, each time he recites it he first raises his arms
to Heaven, and only then with great reverence intones.
'Praise be to Thee, our Great and Just Creator, that by Thy infinite and just grace it is ordained that cows do not fly like pretty little birds. ' "And now, my boy, from the various categories of intelligentsia I
enumerated, it remains for me to tell you about those whom the other beings
there call 'zevrocrats' and 'aristocrats. ' To distinguish them, they are given
nicknames such



as 'emir,' 'count,' 'khan,' 'prince,' 'malik,' 'baron,' and so on, which for some
reason or other resound most pleasantly on that function of your favorites
which expresses itself very strongly in them up to the moment of their death
and which is called 'vanity. '
"I must frankly confess that it is difficult to give you a complete
explanation of these types there, not only in ordinary speech but even in the
language of our wise Mullah Nasr Eddin:
"The most we can say of them is that they are simply 'jokes of nature ' "To tell the truth, although your favorites give them different names, the
aristocrats and zevrocrats are similar in every respect and have exactly
identical inner properties.
"Do you remember that I already told you how in the different
communities on your planet there exist two kinds of 'state organization,' one
called 'monarchic' and the other 'republican'?
"In communities where a republican state organization exists these types
are called 'zevrocrats', whereas in a monarchic state organization they are
called 'aristocrats. '
"To give you at least some notion concerning these two terrestrial types, I
think it will be best if I tell you about my astonishment every time I happened
to meet one of these 'misunderstandings' on your planet Above all, I
wondered how this terrestrial three-brained type could exist on your peculiar
planet almost as long as the other three-brained beings there.
"To be sure, I had already asked myself this question about the beings who
belong to the caste of the bureaucrats, yet in their case I could still explain it
more or less satisfactorily Although their 'series of experiencings' are also
very limited, at least they do actually have them at all times of day and night.
"But according to my observations, all the 'material of



experience' of these aristocrats and zevrocrats is limited to three series. "The first concerns the question of food, the second consists of the
recollections associated with the past functioning of their sex organs, and the
third relates to memories of their first nurse.
"And how could beings whose only material of experience is limited to
these three series of impressions have the same length of existence as that of
other beings on the surface of your planet? This will always be an insoluble
riddle for me.
"It is said that in facing this puzzling question of how these terrestrial
types manage to exist so long, our arch-cunning Lucifer once grew very
thoughtful, and he thought about it so hard that all the hairs on the tip of his
tail turned quite gray.
"As regards those 'jokes of nature,' as I called them, it only remains for me
to try to explain why there is such a striking difference in the names given to
one and the same kind of being.
"I said 'try' because I myself do not know the exact cause, yet, knowing the
roots of the two words from which these names were formed, I think I can
assume with certainty that this difference resulted from a particular custom
existing there.
"I must tell you that your favorites, for some reason or other, are very fond
of putting on what are called 'puppet shows. '
"And for some reason or other they also like to have zevrocrats or
aristocrats take part in these 'puppet plays' of theirs, and accordingly they
always drag them into these 'puppet shows.'
"But as these beings are in themselves quite vacuous and therefore feeble,
other beings of the community have to support them during these 'puppet
shows. '
"And it is simply from the method of support, that is,



according to the arm by which they are held up, that the difference in name
was obtained.
"In the communities where a 'monarchic state organization' exists, it has
long been the custom to support them with the right arm, and hence in these
communities such types are called 'aristocrats.'
"And on the contrary, in the communities where a 'republican state
organization' exists, they are supported with the left arm, and hence are called
'zevrocrats.'
"Concerning such differences in the names of terrestrial beings, some wise
remarks of our esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin come to my mind:
"One day we were speaking about the difference between the judgments
rendered by the Turkish 'qadis' or magistrates, and the Persian ones,
concerning the similarity of their ideas of justice he said:
" 'Ekh! My dear friend! " 'Is there such a thing anywhere on the Earth as a wise legal examination
of a man's guilt?
" 'The "qadis" are the same everywhere, only their names are different In
Persia they are called "Persian," in Turkey, "Turkish. "
" 'And that is just how it is everywhere on the Earth, donkeys are all alike,
they only have different names.
'For instance, the kind of donkey breeding in the Caucasus is called
"Karabaghian,” and the same kind of donkey in Turkestan is called
"Khorassanian." '
"These wise words of his were imprinted on my brain, and during my
existence on your planet I always remembered them whenever I had any
comparison to make.
"May his name be praised forever on that planet where he arose and was
formed!
"And so, my boy . . . "I repeat once more, if for some reason or other you have to be on their planet, always bear in mind that the weakness



I told you about is most strongly developed in the ordinary beings of the
'intelligentsia' there, and particularly in those among them who belong to one
or another of the castes I have mentioned with names ending in 'crat. '
"Well, after this digression I made for your practical benefit, let us return to
the serious question we touched upon.
"I shall begin with the account I promised you of the rise and fall of that
society of terrestrial beings which had as its motto 'The Earth Belongs to Our
Common Creator and Is Equally Free for All His Creatures ' The information
about this will give you the possibility of understanding the first and principal
reason why this terrible periodic process of reciprocal destruction must almost
inevitably occur on your planet among these unfortunate three-brained beings
of our Great Megalocosmos.
"And you will likewise learn how the 'local Nature,' as it might be called,
when something unforeseen prevents it from functioning correctly for the
purposes of the Common-Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat, adapts itself in such a
way that the results can blend in conformity with the harmony of this great
cosmic law.
"That society of terrestrial men-beings arose, as I have already told you,
four or five centuries ago on the continent of Asia in a city then existing under
the name of 'Mosulopolis.'
"And it arose in the following circumstances: "At that period, the processes I have mentioned were flowing more often than ever on that continent. "Some of these processes took place between different communities and
some within the borders of a single community, these latter processes
afterward came to be called 'civil wars.'
"One of the chief causes of these terrible processes, both between and
within communities on the continent of Asia,



was a religion only recently formed and based, fantastically, on the teaching of a genuine Messenger of our Endlessness, Saint Muhammad. "The society I am speaking of was founded by the brothers of a fraternity then existing in Central Asia under the name of the 'Assembly of the Enlightened. ' "Here it must be noted that in those days the brothers of this fraternity were greatly venerated by the other three-brained beings of almost the whole of your planet, and hence this brotherhood was sometimes also called the 'Assembly of All the Living Saints on the Earth. ' "This brotherhood of three-brained terrestrial beings had been founded long before by beings who had noticed in themselves the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer and had come together to work collectively for their deliverance from these consequences. "And so, when these terrible processes of reciprocal destruction became altogether too frequent on their continent of Asia, certain members of this fraternity, with the most venerable Brother Olmantaboor at their head, decided for the first time to see whether it might be possible, if not to abolish this terrible phenomenon from their planet completely, at least to diminish such a crying evil. "Devoting themselves to carrying out this decision, they then visited
various countries of the continent of Asia, and wherever they went they
preached very movingly against the colossal crime and sin of these acts of
men, and thus found many people earnestly in agreement with them.
"The result of their impartial and truly humanitarian labors was the formation in the city of Mosulopolis of that large and serious society of menbeings called 'The Earth Belongs to Our Common Creator and Is Equally Free for All His Creatures. ' "From the very beginning, the members of this society accomplished many things for this aim that no other beings



of the Earth were able to accomplish, either before or since. "And they were able to do this only because, from the start, almost the whole of their program was very well conceived from the point of view of its feasibility in the conditions existing there. "Among other things, the basic program of this society laid out a series of steps to obtain the following results first, the establishment for all the beings of the continent of Asia of one common religion, which they proposed to found upon the teaching, slightly changed, of the sect known as the 'Parsis', second, the adoption of one common language, which was to be 'Turkoman,' the oldest language on the continent of Asia, whose roots had entered into many Asiatic languages And third, the fundamental program of this society included the aim of organizing in the center of Asia, in the city of 'Margelan,' the capital of what was called the khanate of 'Ferghania,' a single central government for all the countries of Asia under the name of the 'Council of the Elders,' the members of which had to be honorable beings from all the Asiatic communities. "And it was given this name because only the oldest and most honorable beings were worthy to participate in it. "According to their understanding, only such beings of their planet were
able to be impartial and just toward all other beings of the Earth, irrespective
of their religion or nationality.
"From the time it was founded in the city of Mosulopolis this society was
composed of beings belonging to almost all the Asiatic communities.
"Among them were beings called 'Mongols,' 'Arabs,' 'Kirghiz,' 'Georgians,'
'Little Russians,' and 'Tamils'—even the personal representative of
Tamerlane, the famous conqueror of that time.
"Thanks to their intense, truly impartial, and unselfish activity, those 'wars' and 'civil wars' which had been on the



increase on the continent of Asia began to diminish, and it was anticipated
that many other good results might be attained for their aims.
"But just then something happened which led to the break-up of this
eminent society of men-beings on that unparalleled planet.
"All the following events came about through the influence of a famous
philosopher, named Atarnakh, and of the theory expounded by him in a
treatise under the title 'Why Do Wars Occur on the Earth?'
"When this philosopher made his appearance among the members of the
society, all their ideas were turned upside down.
"I know the story of this philosopher, Atarnakh, very well, because during
my studies of the results of the labors of the Most Saintly Ashiata Shiemash I
needed to know about the activities of this philosopher in detail, and also
about him personally.
"This Atarnakh was born in that same city of Mosulopolis, into a family of
what are called 'Kurds.'
"After reaching responsible age, he became a great learned being
learned, that is, for the planet Earth.
"This Kurd, Atarnakh, began by devoting many Earth years to the
persevering study of every possible subject that he thought might give him an
answer to the question 'What is in general the sense and meaning of man's
existence?' And in the course of his studies it seems that somehow there fell
into his hands a very ancient but well-preserved Sumerian manuscript.
"This manuscript was well preserved because it had been inscribed with
the blood of a being named 'chirman' on skins of the snake-being called
'kaliandjeks. '
"As my investigations made clear to me, the contents of this manuscript,
inscribed by some learned being of ancient times, greatly interested the
philosopher Atarnakh, who was



particularly struck by one passage in the manuscript where the following supposition was made: 'In all probability there exists in the world some law of the reciprocal maintenance of everything existing. " 'Obviously our lives also serve for maintaining something great or small in the world. "The idea expressed in the ancient manuscript so captivated the
philosopher Atarnakh that from then on he devoted himself entirely to the
study of this one aspect of the question that had interested him.
"This idea served as the basis for a whole plausible theory which, after
several years of investigation and minute experimental verification of his
conclusions, he expounded in his chief work entitled 'Why Do Wars Occur on
the Earth?'
"I also became acquainted with this theory of his. "It was indeed close to reality. "All the hypotheses of this Kurd, Atarnakh, were very similar to the
essence of the great fundamental cosmic law, Trogoautoegocrat, existing in
our Universe, which I explained to you more or less in detail when I was
speaking about the Holy Planet Purgatory
"It was very definitely proved in this theory of the philosopher Atarnakh
that there must inevitably exist in the world a law of the 'reciprocal
maintenance of everything that exists,' and that this 'reciprocal maintenance' is
assisted by certain chemical substances through which the process of the
spiritualization of beings, that is to say, 'life,' takes place, and these chemical
substances serve the maintenance of all that exists only after the life of a
being ceases, that is, when a being dies.
"The theory of Atarnakh also fully proved, with the help of many logical
confrontations, that at certain periods there must infallibly take place on the
Earth a specific quantity of deaths, which in their totality must yield
vibrations of a specific 'degree of power.'



"Once at a general meeting of the being-members of the society, 'The
Earth Belongs to Our Common Creator and Is Equally Free for All His
Creatures,' this anything but ordinary terrestrial three-brained being, who was
also the elected representative of the whole population of the country called
'Kurdistan,' at the request of his fellow members, expounded his theory very
eloquently and in detail, and this aroused great confusion and agitation
among the members of the society.
"They were so struck by his theory that at first a 'sepulchral silence'
prevailed among them, and they were so stupefied that no one could stir.
Only after rather a long interval did such an uproar break out that it seemed as
if each one's life depended on the degree of his excitement and the ve
hemence of its expression.
"The result of it all was that late that night they unanimously decided to
select from their number several learned beings to investigate jointly the
details of this theory which had impressed them so strongly, and afterward to
make a report on it to the general assembly.
"From the very next day, the selected learned members of the society set
to work very earnestly to familiarize themselves with the theory of this
Atarnakh.
"But to the misfortune of all terrestrial three-brained beings of future
times, it turned out that although most of the appointed learned members
were well advanced in years, and those baneful functions which make the
being of your favorites 'jealous' and 'greedy' were almost atrophied in them,
nevertheless for various reasons, chiefly owing to their upbringing in
childhood, certain of them had not yet acquired enough experience to be
convinced that their dreams—ensuing from that abnormal education of
theirs— could never be realized, and they were therefore not disillusioned
enough to be fully impartial and just.
"And in consequence of this, from that very same day,



as they became familiar with the details of this astonishing theory, they began to get into the state typical of terrestrial beings, that is, they began to forget what had been said in that theory which had so struck them, and gradually returning, as is proper to three-brained beings there, to their former purely subjective and thus always changeable convictions, they forthwith split into two opposing parties. "Some of them began without any logical criticisms to take on faith all the suppositions advanced in this theory, others, however, as is proper to most of the 'learned beings' of the Earth, began to say and to argue just the opposite, finally working themselves up into a state of hostility not only against his theory but even against Atarnakh himself. "In short, my boy, those learned beings who had been chosen to make the
detailed study of the theory of Atarnakh, instead of helping to extricate the
other members from their bewilderment and agitation and to settle the
disputes among themselves, only increased the confusion of their ideas, and
gradually, in the common presence of each member of this earnest society,
data automatically arose for two completely opposite convictions.
"The first of these convictions was that everything takes place precisely according to the theory of the philosopher Atarnakh, that is to say, that 'wars' and 'civil wars' must proceed periodically on the Earth, quite independently of the personal consciousness of men And the second was the conviction held previously by all the members of the society, according to which, if they succeeded in carrying out the program their society had undertaken, it would be possible to destroy this evil on their planet, root and branch, after which everything would proceed in a desirable order. "From then on, disputes, quarrels, and disturbances arose among all the members of that society, and in this case also, the same began to proceed as had long before become customary there. These quarrels and disturbances soon spread



to the ordinary beings, that is, to the citizens of Mosulopolis, inflaming their
abnormal psyche.
"I do not know how all this would have ended if the brothers of the
'Assembly of the Enlightened' had not arrived just then and taken a hand in
this affair.
"Due to their influence, all the members of this serious society gradually
quieted down and started once again to reflect and deliberate, peaceably and
earnestly, upon what to do in the future.
"The result of their serious reflections and deliberations was that they
unanimously elected Atarnakh as their chief director, and begged him to help
them find some way out of this situation.
"After several meetings directed by the Kurd philosopher Atarnakh
himself, the members of the society came unanimously to the following
categorical conclusion.
" 'In accordance with the laws of Nature, wars and civil wars must always
proceed periodically on Earth, independently of man's will, and this is
because at certain periods Nature requires a greater quantity of deaths.
" 'In view of this we are all obliged to recognize, with great sorrow but
with inevitable inner resignation, that no decision of man's Reason can
abolish the shedding of blood between states and within a state We therefore
unanimously resolve to wind up our current affairs and put an end to
everything undertaken by our society, and then perforce to separate and go
home to take up again the "inescapable burden of daily life. "
"It was only after this categorical resolution was passed, and all the
members of that serious society had unanimously decided to begin that very
day liquidating all their affairs, that the Kurd, Atarnakh, who although
considered there as truly learned was nonetheless very proud and self-loving,
ascended the rostrum and spoke as follows: 'My honorable colleagues



" 'I am sincerely grieved that unintentionally I have been the cause of the
dissolution of this great philanthropic undertaking to which you, the wisest
and most honorable men of all the countries of the Earth have, for several
years, devoted more impartial and unselfish efforts than anyone on Earth has
ever made or ever will be able to make for others—that is to say, for beings
quite unknown and indifferent to you.
'For a number of years you have labored unceasingly to obtain for the
masses what is most essential for their welfare and, although I too have
labored upon my theory for many years, also for people unknown to me, this
theory has brought all your tireless efforts and benevolent aspirations to
nothing.
" 'The consciousness that I am to blame for all the misunderstandings that
have arisen among you has given me no peace these last few days, and I have
been thinking and pondering continuously whether there is not some way to
repair this involuntary fault of mine.
" 'And so, my wise colleagues, selected from all the countries of the Earth,
I wish to share with you the final conclusion to which my deliberations have
brought me.
" 'If the universal laws I have discovered are an obstacle to the means you
were counting on to bring a certain happiness to mankind, these same laws,
however strange it may seem to you at first glance, could, provided they are
used otherwise, serve for the attainment of the aim we have set ourselves
" 'Now listen to what we must do to attain this aim. " 'The results of all my researches clearly prove that at certain periods
Nature requires a specific number of deaths on the Earth, at the same time I
have succeeded in establishing that for the needs of Nature it makes no
difference whose deaths these are, whether of people or of other forms of
beings.



'From this it follows that if the number of deaths required by Nature is
made up by the deaths of other forms of life, the required number of deaths of
men will obviously be proportionately reduced.
" 'And it will be quite possible to achieve this if all the members of our
society continue to work with the same intensity, only no longer for the aim of
carrying out our former program, but to revive on Earth, on a larger scale than
before, the ancient custom among men of offering sacrifices to their gods and
saints by destroying the lives of other forms of beings.
"When this proud Kurd had finished his speech, the members of the society
'The Earth Belongs to Our Common Creator and Is Equally Free for All His
Creatures' became no less astonished and agitated than on the occasion when
he first expounded his famous theory.
"For nearly three days and nights following that memorable speech they
scarcely adjourned, and in the halls that had been put at the disposal of this
all-planetary society of men-beings by the citizens of Mosulopolis, there was a
continuous rumble of discussion and deliberation At last, on the fourth day, an
official general meeting was convened at which, by general consent, a
resolution was carried to do in the future whatever was indicated by the great
Kurd philosopher, Atarnakh.
"That same day, the name of the society was changed to 'The Earth Is Only
for Men.
"Several days later, the members of that society, now under its new name,
left the city of Mosulopolis for their native countries where, under general
instructions issued by the philosopher Atarnakh, they took measures for
reviving and implanting among the peoples of the continent of Asia the idea
of 'pleasing' their gods and idols by killing beings of different forms.



"And indeed, when they later began putting their new program into
practice, the custom of offering sacrifices to their imaginary 'saints' by
destroying the existence of various weak or stupid one-brained and two
brained beings was soon reestablished over the whole continent of Asia.
"From the beginning, the members of this new society, 'The Earth Is Only
for Men,' carried out their task chiefly through what are called the 'clergy' of
the religion founded upon the teaching of Saint Muhammad, which was very
widespread at that period over the entire Asiatic continent.
"This time the custom was adopted on a larger scale than it had been when,
at the request of the Angel Looisos, I had descended there to do what I could
to eradicate it among the three-brained beings As I have already told you, His
Conformity had then regarded this custom as very undesirable in relation to
cosmic phenomena on a greater scale because the number of your favorites
had greatly increased, thereby increasing the number of those anxious to 'give
pleasure' to their fantastic idols.
"The destruction of the existence of beings of other forms was now
resumed not only at home among their families but also publicly in special
places.
"But this time these special places were chiefly associated in some way
with the memory of Saint Muhammad, or of his disciples.
"The number of 'victims' increased year by year to such an extent that only
about a hundred of their years after the formation of the society 'The Earth Is
Only for Men,' there were slaughtered each year, in a single place, up to a
hundred thousand beings like those that had been sacrificed in earlier times,
called 'oxen,' 'sheep,' 'camels,' and so on.
"During the last two centuries, the most favored among the places honored
in this way were the cities of 'Mecca' and 'Medina' in 'Arabia,' the city of
'Meshed' in the region



of 'Baghdad,' the environs of 'Yangi-kishlak' in 'Turkestan,' and several others.
"In a word, there on the continent of Asia, 'blood again flowed like a river. '
"These sacrificial offerings increased during the Muslim feasts called
'Bairam' and 'Goorban,' and likewise during the Christian festivals called
'Shrovetide,' 'Saint George's Day,' and so on
"And so, my boy, when this abnormality was again implanted in three
brained beings there through the strenuous efforts of the members of the
society 'The Earth Is Only for Men,' those terrible processes of theirs did
indeed take place less often and on a smaller scale In this way the sporadic,
relatively great mortality due to these processes was diminished, but the
general death rate of the three-brained beings was not only not reduced by this
but even increased, since on account of the gradual and steady deterioration in
the quality of the vibrations emanating from their presence for the needs of
Nature, there was a further shortening in the duration of their existence and at
the same time an increase in what is called their 'birth rate. '
"So it continued until the time when a certain Assadulla Ibrahim Ogly, a
famous Persian dervish, who arose and was formed into a responsible being
on that same continent, turned all this in quite another direction.
"The dervish Assadulla Ibrahim Ogly began his activity there only some
thirty or forty terrestrial years ago.
"Being a simple fanatic of Islam, without the serious and profound
knowledge of the Kurd, Atarnakh, he saw in the custom of sacrificial
offerings only a horrible injustice on the part of men toward beings of other
forms, and he set as the aim of his existence to achieve, at any cost, the
destruction on Earth of this custom, which in his opinion was anti-religious.



"From then on he traveled everywhere on the continent of Asia, chiefly in
those countries where most of the three-brained beings were followers of
Islam, and he worked mainly through dervishes like himself, who were to be
found in almost all these communities.
"Everywhere he went, this ingenious and energetic Persian, Assadulla
Ibrahim Ogly, very cleverly persuaded these other dervishes of the 'truth' of
his idea, and these in their turn persuaded the ordinary beings of Asia not
only that the destruction of the existence of beings of other forms is dis
pleasing to God, but that those who destroyed them would even be obliged to
suffer a double punishment 'in another world' in hell, both for their own 'sins'
and for the 'sins' of the beings they had slaughtered, and so on.
"Thanks to this kind of preaching about the 'other world' by dervishes,
considered great authorities in such matters, the beings of Asia did indeed,
year by year, reduce the number of their sacrificial offerings.
"And the final result of all the activity of this 'humane Persian dervish' was
precisely the last great process of reciprocal destruction or, as your favorites
call it, 'the First World War. '
"So, my boy, although, as I have already told you, the hypothesis put forward
by that unusual learned Kurd, Atarnakh, came very close to the truth, he
failed to understand the most important thing, which is that the vibrations re
quired by Great Nature that are formed from the emanations issuing from the
process of their 'rascooarno' have no significance quantitatively, but only
qualitatively.
"It is possible that since Atarnakh was an uncommon terrestrial being, he
might have understood this if he had known in detail the results obtained
when there had been more or less established on that planet the conditions of



being-existence especially created for the three-brained beings through the most saintly labors of the essence-loving, Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash. "During that period, not only did their 'death rate' begin to decline, but
what they call their 'birth rate' also declined.
"And this was because the three-brained beings there were then existing more or less as is becoming to three-centered beings, and the emanations issuing from them yielded vibrations more akin to those required from them by Nature, both for the Most Great Common-Cosmic Trogoautoegocrat in general and for the maintenance of the Moon and Anulios in particular And thereafter, Great Nature did not fail to adapt herself to the decline in their birth rate, the more so since for the following period the need for these vibrations to maintain the existence of the planet Moon had to be reduced. "Among the diverse aspects of this fundamental question, the one relating to the meaning and aim of the existence of your favorites is so important for understanding many things taking place on the Earth—and, by the way, also for understanding everything touching the causes of war—that I find it necessary to refer to it once more. "I first learned that the destiny of the three-brained beings arising on this planet is chiefly to elaborate, by the very process of their existence, the vibrations required by Nature for the maintenance of those former parts of their planet now called 'Moon' and 'Anulios' when, as you remember, I was worthy for the second time of conversing personally with His Conformity the Angel, now Archangel, Looisos. "His Conformity then told me that although the movement of the two former parts of the planet Earth had been finally regulated to accord with the movement of the general harmony, and though all apprehension of some surprise or other in the immediate future had vanished, nevertheless, to avoid any possible complications in the distant future it had



been categorically decided by the Most High and Most Sacred Individuals to
take the necessary measures to insure the formation on the Earth of what is
called the sacred 'askokin,' so that this sacred cosmic substance, indispensable
for the maintenance of the Moon and Anulios, might issue continuously from
your planet.
"His Conformity also explained that this cosmic substance, the sacred
'askokin,' exists throughout the Universe, generally blended with the sacred
substances 'abrustdonis' and 'helkdonis,' and therefore, in order to have the
degree of vivifyingness required for such maintenance, the sacred substance
'askokin' must first be freed from the other two substances.
"To tell the truth, my boy, I did not understand at once all that he told me,
it all became clear to me only later when, during my studies of the
fundamental cosmic laws, I learned that these sacred substances 'abrustdonis'
and 'helkdonis' are precisely those substances which enter into the formation
and perfecting of the higher being-bodies of the three-brained beings—that is,
the 'kesdjan body' and the 'body of the soul'—and that the separation of the
sacred 'askokin' from the two other substances proceeds when beings, on
whatever planet they may be, transmute these sacred substances in themselves
for the forming and perfecting of their higher bodies, by means of conscious
labor and intentional suffering.
"And when I became interested in these favorites of yours and began to
observe and study their strange psyche, I finally understood why and to what
ends Great Nature herself and the Most High and Most Saintly Individuals are
always patiently adapting themselves to all things In this connection, the
following personal opinion was formed in me.
"If only these favorites of yours would seriously ponder all this and serve
Nature honestly in this respect, their being-self-perfecting might then proceed
automatically, even with



out the participation of their consciousness, and in any case, the poor Nature
of this ill-fated planet would not have to strain so hard to adapt herself to
remain within the common-cosmic harmony.
"But to the misfortune of everything existing in the Megalocosmos, there
is no honesty in your favorites in fulfilling their duties, not even toward that
Nature to whom, in truth, they owe their very existence.
"As regards the absence of honesty in your favorites in the fulfillment of
their duty toward Nature, I have just remembered a very wise saying of our
incomparable teacher Mullah Nasr Eddin, the hidden meaning of which is
borne out in the present case.
" 'Plague and cholera are in any event nobler than human honesty, for
people with a conscience can at least live at peace with them. '
"And so, my dear Hassein, when it became clear that there had entirely
disappeared from the psyche of your favorites the instinctive need for
conscious labor and intentional suffering in order to take in and transmute in
themselves the sacred substances abrustdonis and helkdonis—thus releasing
the sacred askokin for the maintenance of the Moon and Anulios—Great
Nature was constrained to adapt herself and to extract this sacred substance
by other means, one of them being precisely that periodic terrifying process
of reciprocal destruction.
"Here, for a correct valuation of your contemporary favorites, it will be
opportune to remind you that after the organ kundabuffer had been removed
from the three-brained beings of your planet, the first generations of their
descendants very soon learned that a certain substance had to be transformed
through them and that their assistance in this transformation was one of their
chief being-duties.
"Do you remember, I already told you that the three-brained beings of the
continent of Atlantis even considered



this being-duty as sacred and called it 'amarloos,' which in their language meant 'help for the Moon. ' "And so the beings of that period, which was then called the 'Samliosian
civilization,' devised and very scrupulously practiced certain customs that
contributed to the fulfillment of those being-duties in the most effective way.
"These beings of the continent of Atlantis even devised a wise and
practical means of fulfilling these two being-duties—namely, the duty of
perfecting their higher bodies and the duty of serving the Most Great Cosmic
Trogoautoegocrat—by uniting them into one and performing them
simultaneously.
"And they accomplished this union in the following way: "In every region, and even in the separate districts of the regions, three
special, very imposing buildings were required to be built.
"One, for the beings of the male sex, was called 'agoorokhrostini .'
"The second building, reserved for beings of the female sex, was called
'gynekokhrostini. '
"The third, for beings then called the 'middle sex,' was called
'anoroparionikima.'
"The first two of these imposing buildings were considered sacred by the
beings of the continent of Atlantis, representing for them what 'temples,'
'churches,' 'chapels,' and other sacred places are for the contemporary beings
of the Earth.
"When I descended for the first time on that planet to the continent of
Atlantis, I myself visited certain of these buildings and thus became well
acquainted with their purpose.
"In the temples for men, namely in the 'agoorokhrostinis,' beings of the
male sex of the given region or district performed in turn appropriate
'mysteries' while in a particular state called 'self-remembering. '
"The beings of the continent of Atlantis had the definite



idea that beings of the male sex are sources of active manifestation; and hence
in their agoorokhrostinis they devoted their whole time to active and
conscious contemplation, and in this state performed these corresponding
sacred mysteries, so that there should be transmuted in them the sacred sub
stances abrustdonis and helkdonis.
"And they did this intentionally and with full consciousness in order that
the sacred substance liberated in them, and issuing through their emanations
for its further vivifying-ness, should become the active part in that sacred law
which they call the 'Holy Trinity.'
"In the sacred 'gynekokhrostinis,' reserved for the beings of the female sex,
every woman was obliged to remain during certain periods that contemporary
beings call 'menstruation. ' Moreover, the women, acknowledging themselves
as passive beings, had to be passive during the whole time of their stay there,
so that the substance issuing through their emanations should serve as the
passive part of that same sacred law for its further vivifyingness.
"Hence they passed the whole time in these gynekokhrostinis in a state of
complete passivity, trying consciously not to think about anything.
"With this aim in view, they tried to have no active experiencings during
their monthly periods, and in order that the flow of associations should not
hinder them from concentrating, everything was arranged so that their
thoughts should be directed the whole time to wishing for the well-being of
their present or future children.
"And as regards the buildings of the third kind, which were called
'anoroparionokimas,' they were erected, as I already told you, for the beings
belonging to what was then called the 'middle sex,' whom our Mullah Nasr
Eddin would call 'misunderstandings' or beings who are 'neither one thing nor
the other.'



"Among these beings of the 'middle sex' were some of the male sex and some of the female sex. "These were beings who, for various reasons, no longer had the possibility either of perfecting themselves or of serving Nature, they were, as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin puts it in one of his sayings, 'Neither a candle for an angel, nor a poker for the devil. ' "Beings of the male sex were secluded in these houses for a certain time who, for some reason or other, were wholly deprived of the possibility of conscious contemplation, and beings of the female sex were secluded who either did not menstruate at all, or in whom menstruation occurred abnormally, as were also those women who with regard to their sexual desires became transformed at certain periods into what are called 'khaneomenis' or, as our dear Mullah would say, into 'veritable mares in springtime. ' "The beings of the continent of Atlantis of that time were familiar with several definite bizarre symptoms by which these beings were recognized and confined in the anoroparionikimas. "These symptoms could be recognized by the following particularities:
1 if a being believed in all sorts of 'balderdash', 2 if he began proving to others something he knew absolutely nothing about, or was not quite sure of, 3 if he failed to keep his word of honor, or took an oath in vain, 4 and finally, if he showed a tendency to 'spy' on others and to be occupied with 'took-soo-kef'
"But the most conclusive symptom of all was the appearance in a being of what was then called 'moyasul,' which



your contemporary favorites consider as an illness and call 'hemorrhoids. '
"Beings with these symptoms were obliged to remain in these
anoroparionikimas during the periods indicated by the beings around them,
but they were under no compulsion to do anything, and existed as they
pleased In regard to them there was only one purpose, which was that they
should neither meet nor speak with normal beings of the given locality.
"They were confined in these buildings because at certain periods of the
month, according to the prevailing ideas, on account of their various 'taints,'
their 'emanations' interfered with the quiet and regular existence of beings
surrounding them.
"Ekh, yes, my dear boy . . . "Beings of the final period of the continent of Atlantis had many excellent
customs for normal being-existence But as for your contemporary favorites,
they can only be pitied because, owing to the second great calamity to their
ill-fated planet, that continent and everything on it was engulfed, and with it
disappeared all those good customs which over long centuries had gradually
entered into the process of their ordinary existence.
"Long after the continent of Atlantis was destroyed, the custom of using
special buildings in the process of ordinary existence, similar to those of
which I have just told you, was reestablished.
"The need for these special buildings was again understood and their use
was reestablished by a certain wise Hebrew king named Solomon.
"The special buildings which this wise Hebrew king decided to construct
and which existed long after his time were called 'tak-tschan-nan. '
"They somewhat resembled the gynekokhrostinis of the



continent of Atlantis, and beings of the female sex were obliged to remain in
them during the whole period of their menstruation.
"King Solomon lost no time in establishing this custom because, during his
wise reign, he had often observed that in the state of menstruation the
character of the beings of the female sex became not only intolerable for those
around them, especially for their husbands, but even psycho-organically
harmful as regards their 'inconsistent' behavior toward others He therefore
decided without delay to promulgate a strict law specifying that near every
populated center special isolated buildings had to be constructed, in which the
beings of the female sex were to be confined for the whole duration of this
state.
"I even happened to read the law he promulgated. "In this law it was said, among other things, that during their menstruation
women are 'unclean,' in the sacred sense of the word, and that during these
periods it is not only a great sin but even a sacrilege for anyone, especially
their husbands, to touch them or even to speak with them.
"If their husbands or any other men approach or speak with them during
this period, they will be possessed by an 'unclean force' or 'evil spirit,' and in
consequence there will be among men in their everyday relations and affairs
only misunderstandings, quarrels, and enmity.
"This last statement of the great terrestrial sage, King Solomon, remains
today an undeniable truth.
"And indeed, this is also one of the numerous reasons why at the present
time the ordinary existence of the beings of your planet has become
nonsensical in the extreme.
"Among contemporary terrestrial beings of the female sex, the specific
property acquired during recent centuries called 'hysteria' becomes still more
marked during these states, and as long as it lasts, these women reduce the
beings around them, particularly their husbands, to the condition



which our great Mullah Nasr Eddin refers to when he says: 'The purpose of their existence is to be the victims of leeches. "And indeed, it is solely because the contemporary beings of the female
sex go about freely during menstruation that many contemporary beings of the
male sex not only can never have good or friendly relations with each other,
but also very frequently become genuine what are called 'later-repenting
blasphemers. '
"This beneficial custom created by the wise King Solomon existed among
the Jewish people for a considerable time and would certainly have spread
over the whole Earth, had it not been for that other specific property of the
beings there about which I have also already told you.
"For when the Jewish people had in their turn fallen from their greatness,
as usually happens there, the beings of other communities—who, driven by
the impulses of jealousy and envy inherent in your favorites for all those
higher than themselves, had already hated them in the days of their greatness
and power—despised and persecuted them, and of course also scorned all
their excellent customs.
"And when this Jewish people had fallen under the influence of other
communities that had become great, they began to follow their example,
owing to a characteristic property about which I have already sufficiently
explained to you, and this good custom not only did not spread further but
even gradually began to be despised, and was finally forsaken and forgotten
by the very founders themselves.
"At the present time, this custom survives only among the beings of a very
small community in the mountains of the Caucasus, known by the name of
'Khevsoors'—those same Khevsoors who give many scientists there sleepless
nights trying to solve the problem of their origin.
"As regards the habit of your favorites of destroying the good customs for ordinary existence already established by



their ancestors on their planet, we must again express our condolences to poor Nature, who must always be adapting and readapting herself. "And concerning the misfortunes of Nature on this incomparable planet, our dear teacher, the peerless Mullah Nasr Eddin, has also some very apt remarks.
"For example, he says in such a case: " 'Ekh . . . if you're unlucky enough, you could even catch syphilis from your godmother!'
"Or sometimes he says: " 'You poor devil! Your mother must have sung an Armenian lament while you were being born. "Even the interpreter of Russian popular wisdom, Kusma Prutkoff, has a good saying for such cases: 'The unluckiest of us all is the pine cone, because every "Makkar" stumbles over it. ' "I repeat, this unfortunate Nature of the planet Earth must continuously and without respite adapt herself in order to manifest herself 'otherwise,' and yet again 'otherwise,' so as to remain within the common-cosmic harmony
"In order that you may the better represent to yourself and understand in what way unfortunate Nature has to adapt herself in order to obtain the 'equilibrium of vibrations' required from this planet for the common-cosmic harmony, I shall explain to you one thing that is taking place there now, just after the process of reciprocal destruction they call the 'First World War. ' "It was obviously owing to the German invention of 'poison gas' and the English what are called 'rapid-fire machine guns' that the quantity of rascooarnos, or deaths, was on this occasion on a scale far greater than foreseen by Nature or—as those candidates for hasnamuss, the contemporary businessmen, would say—there was an 'overproduction' of the deaths of three-brained beings.



"And so Nature once more had to puff and blow and, as is said there, Jump out of her skin' to correct this unforeseeingness and adapt herself again in a corresponding way. "This time, as I ascertained in the course of my last stay there, and as was later also confirmed by etherogram, Great Nature is evidently about to increase for the future the birth rate of other forms of beings there. "I myself noticed in the cities of Petrograd and Tiflis, situated in the large community of Russia—where during their World War more beings perished than in any other community—that the quadruped beings, namely those manhating quadrupeds called 'wolves,' which as a rule never appeared there, were already prowling in the streets. "This etherogram informed me, among other things, that in this large community of Russia the birth rate of rodent beings called 'mice' and 'rats' had increased to such proportions that they are now devouring most of the provisions stored by the three-brained beings there. "This etherogram further conveyed the information that the powerpossessing beings of the community of Russia had appealed to the beings of another European community to undertake the destruction of the existence of those little beings, rats and mice, which had multiplied among them And in return they promised to pay whatever sum of money it would cost. "Although a temporary reduction in the number of these poor rats and mice
might be obtained by various means at the disposal of these specialists in
destroying the existence of others, they will hardly consent to do this gratis,
and the beings of Russia, in spite of their promises, will of course not be able
to pay in money, since the amount might be even more than the cost of their
last war.
"And as for getting money from the same sources they had already drained dry during that great process . . . as our dear Mullah Nasr Eddin says, 'Don't make me laugh! Even



a donkey can understand that in peacetime, peasant flesh is worthless.
Having said this, Beelzebub became silent and looked expectantly at his grandson who, as though talking to himself, asked very sadly in a voice of despair.
"How will it all end? Is there really no way out? "Must those unfortunate souls who were formed on that ill-fated planet really remain eternally unperfected and be endlessly coated in various planetary forms, languishing everlastingly on account of the consequences of the properties of that accursed organ kundabuffer, which for reasons extraneous to them was implanted in the planetary bodies of the first threecentered beings of that ill-fated planet? "Where then is that pillar upon which, as it were, our whole Megalocosmos
rests, and which is called 'Justice'?
"No! . . . It cannot be! Something is wrong . . . because during the whole of
my existence, not once has the smallest doubt ever crept into me that
Objective Justice exists.
"I must see this clearly and understand it . . . why? why? "At any rate, from this very moment, it will be the aim of my existence to
understand clearly why the souls arising in those terrestrial three-centered
beings are in such an unprecedentedly terrible situation. . . "
Having said this, poor Hassein, as though overwhelmed, bowed his head
and became deeply thoughtful.
Beelzebub gave him a strange look—strange, because in this look his love
for Hassein shone through, and at the same time it could be seen how glad he
was that his grandson was experiencing such sorrow.
Their silence lasted a fairly long time At last Beelzebub heaved a deep sigh, as though from the depths of his being, and turned to his grandson with the following words:



"Yes, my dear Hassein . . . "Certainly there is something not quite right here. "But if nothing could be done by that Being who has now the Reason of
the sacred 'Podkoolad' and is one of the first assistants of our Endlessness in
the government of the world, namely, the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash—if
even he could do nothing for the beings of that planet, what can we say, we
whose Reason is scarcely higher than that of ordinary beings?
"Do you remember how the Very Saintly Ashiata Shiemash, in his
deliberations under the title of 'The Terror of the Situation,' said.
" 'If it is still possible to save the beings of the Earth, Time alone can do it.'
"As for us, we can only say the same thing in regard to this terrible
property of theirs we have just been speaking of, that is, their periodic need to
destroy each other's existence.
"For the moment, we can only say that if this property of the terrestrial
beings is to disappear from that unfortunate planet, it will be through Time
alone, either under the guidance of a Being with very high Reason or thanks
to certain exceptional cosmic events.
Having said this, Beelzebub again turned to Hassein with that same strange
look.



CHAPTER 44
In Beelzebub's opinion, man's
understanding of justice is in the objective
sense an accursed mirage
SMILING and continuing to look affectionately at his grandson Hassein,
Beelzebub said: "Now it seems to me, my dear future substitute, after all I
have related to you and all you have taken in concerning the three-brained
beings breeding on the planet Earth, that the moment has come to speak about
the question to which I promised to devote myself at the end of all these tales
of mine.
"I wish to speak about that maleficent idea so widespread among your
favorites, to which I referred, as you will remember, when I spoke about the
chief 'stumbling block' in their psyche, that is, their diverse and peculiar
'havatviernonis,' or religions, as they call them, namely, that idea which has
become the basis of all their religions, the idea of 'Good' and 'Evil. '
"I also told you that, on account of this maleficent idea prevailing among
the terrestrial three-brained beings, great events or, as I would express it in the
words of your favorites, 'turmoils,' recently occurred on the Holy Planet
Purgatory, and their involuntary cause happened to be certain members of
your 'hernasdjinsa' or, as one would say on the Earth, your 'genealogical tree.'
"To help you to picture better and assimilate more easily what I intend to
explain to you, I must first of all go back to certain long-past events, which at
first glance have nothing in common with this idea.
"And so . . . I have already told you that on my fifth



flight to the surface of your planet, I stayed only a short time and soon
returned home to the planet Mars.
"This was because my friends notified me from the Center that there would
shortly appear on the planet Mars one of the cherubim close to our All
Embracing Endlessness, with some command that concerned me.
"Soon after my return to the planet Mars, the cherub did indeed make his
appearance there The command given him from Above concerning me was
that, owing to my conscious labors to bring about results for the common
cosmic welfare—labors that had led to the abolition of the practice of
'sacrificial offerings' among the three-brained beings who have taken your
fancy—and also owing to the personal petition of His Conformity, the Angel
Looisos, before our Common Father Endlessness, the punishment for my per
sonal transgression was reduced in the sense that thenceforward it would no
longer include my posterity.
"So from then on my children, that is, your father and your uncle Tooilan,
could return to the Center whenever they wished, and there, in the bosom of
our Common Father, fulfill their obligations corresponding to His innumer
able actualizations.
"After this event, so important for our family, my sons soon left the planet
Mars and returned to the Center where, on their arrival, already having great
knowledge in certain fields of Objective Science and skill in the practical
application of its laws, they were chosen for appropriate responsible duties.
"Your father was immediately assigned to the post of 'zirlikner' on one of
the parts of the surface of our dear Karatas, and gradually became worthy of
assuming the responsibility of chief zirlikner of all the three-brained beings on
our planet, a post that he still holds.
"And your uncle Tooilan, as I have already told you, was then enrolled as
one of the assistants to the director of the



etherogram station on the Holy Planet Purgatory which, then as now, has an
etherogram connection with almost all the planets of our Great Universe.
"Later he merited the post of chief director, which he still fills at the
present time.
"I must also explain to you, my boy, why on their arrival at the Center my
results or, to use the expression of your favorites, my 'sons,' were at once
deemed worthy to occupy these responsible posts.
"You will understand the reason for this if I tell you that among those who
shared my exile from its very beginning was the chief zirlikner of our planet
Karatas, the still young but already very learned Pooloodjistius, who, after
our all-gracious pardon, was considered worthy to be, and still is today, an
assistant to the Great Observer of the movements of all the concentrations of
the Megalocosmos—His Self-Keepness the Arch-Seraph Ksheltarna.
"And so, when I began to organize my observatory on the planet Mars, the
learned Pooloodjistius proposed that I should take him as inspector and
manager of this new establishment.
"Of course I immediately agreed with his proposal, as he was a very great
expert on the location of all large and small cosmic concentrations as well as
an authority on the laws governing their reciprocal maintenance And from
then on, this great, learned Pooloodjistius resided in my house on the planet
Mars.
"Later, when the results of my active principle arose and were formed to corresponding age, I asked this learned Pooloodjistius also to undertake the duty of 'oskianotsner' or, as your favorites would say, 'educator' of my children He consented with great readiness, because, existing there under unusual conditions, he had no possibility of using his many-sided learning to his satisfaction, and this proposal of mine opened what is called a 'wide field of activity' for him.



"From then on, apart from the execution of his duties, which at the
beginning were not too heavy, he devoted himself entirely to the creation of
appropriate inner and outer conditions that would permit my sons to take in
impressions furthering the crystallization in themselves of the being-data
required for a responsible existence worthy of three-brained beings.
"Your father and your uncle Tooilan soon became so attached to him that
they never left his side, even when he was fulfilling his principal duties at the
observatory, and even during these moments the good Pooloodjistius
constantly enlightened their Reason and gave them practical explanations
about observing various concentrations, the methods of studying their
reciprocal influence, and the significance of these influences themselves.
"He explained to them how, and for what purpose, a definite cosmic
concentration occupies a certain place, and informed them about the
particularities of the influence that these concentrations have on one another
during the common-cosmic trogoautoegocratic process.
"In this way, under the guidance of this remarkable learned being, there
were crystallized in the common presence of my results not only the data
required for every responsible three-brained being, but also many data for the
recognition and direct perception of true information about cosmic
concentrations and their functionin.
"By the way, it was just at this period that in each of my sons a subjective
interest was gradually formed in what would become their favorite fields of
observation and study.
"Your father, for example, liked to observe and study the reciprocal
influence and maintenance of cosmic concentrations situated in the spheres
nearest to the Prime Source, the Most Most Holy Sun Absolute, while your
uncle Tooilan manifested a special interest in observations of the planet Earth
and the process of existence of the three-brained beings



breeding there It was partly due to me that this interest was aroused in him
because, during my investigations of the psyche of your favorites, when I
happened to be occupied with something else, I often entrusted him with
keeping notes of all the changes which took place among them.
"When my sons were preparing to leave the planet Mars forever, your
uncle Tooilan, as I was giving him my blessing, begged me to keep him
periodically informed about my observations and study of the strange psyche
of the biped beings of the planet Earth, which of course I promised to do And
then they flew away toward the center closest to our Common Father.
"On their arrival it was soon evident that they knew a great deal about the
position of cosmic concentrations, their properties and particularities, and
were skilled in calculating the totality of their reciprocal influences within the
whole, and so they were immediately assigned to the responsible duties I
mentioned.
"From the time I learned of the permanent place of their existence and the
posts of which they had been found worthy, I sent to Tooilan every quarter of
our year, as I had promised, an exact copy of all my notes on the observations
I was making.
"Many years had passed since I began sending these etherograms to
Tooilan, and I never knew what became of them until the day I was informed
about those turbulent events on the planet Purgatory.
"It transpired that the high governor of the Holy Planet Purgatory, His All
Quarters Maintainer the Arch-Cherub Helkgematios, happening to learn that
one of the assistant directors of the etherogram station, Tooilan, periodically
received long etherograms from his father in the solar system Ors, expressed
the wish to be made acquainted with their contents It turned out that he not
only became much interested in them himself, but even requested your uncle



Tooilan to reproduce their contents regularly on the 'toolookhtertzinek'
which is to a certain degree similar to what is called on Earth the 'radio'—so
that some of the 'highest being-bodies' dwelling on the holy planet might, if
they wished, by way of relaxation, listen to this information about the psyche
of those peculiar three-brained beings inhabiting one of the very remote
corners of our Megalocosmos.
"Your uncle Tooilan did as he was requested. Whenever he received
etherograms from me he reproduced their contents on the common planetary
'toolookhtertzinek,' and in this way all those righteous souls dwelling on the
holy planet were kept informed of my observations and investigations of that
strange psyche of the beings of the planet Earth.
"From then on, certain of the highest being-bodies on the holy planet, who
were following all my observations very attentively, began to ponder on this
strange psyche.
"This pondering of the blessed highest being-bodies led them to
understand that something was wrong with the psyche of the three-brained
beings of the planet Earth, and they even became suspicious about the origin
of this 'something wrong'; and ultimately many of them became seriously
indignant at what first seemed to them to be an injustice from Above.
"The more these indignant 'righteous souls' shared their impressions with
others, the greater their number became, so that everywhere in the
'zarooariakhs,' that is, the 'towns' and 'villages' of the holy planet, they thought
and deliberated among themselves only about this.
"The result of it all was that the inhabitants of the holy planet chose fifty
righteous souls to undertake a Joint investigation and to find out the true
reason why such an absurdity existed in the psyche of the three-brained
beings of the planet Earth, preventing all possibility of self



perfecting for the 'highest being-part' which, for various reasons, sometimes arises in certain of these beings also. "The chosen fifty righteous souls were precisely those who had already become worthy to be candidates for returning to the Most Holy Source of everything existing. "His All-Quarters Maintainer, the Arch-Cherub Helkgematios, the governor of the holy planet, not only sanctioned the choice of these fifty blessed souls but, by his own all-gracious decision, expressed the desire to help them in every way in fulfilling their undertaking. "And so, my boy, when these fifty candidates for the Sun Absolute undertook their investigations, it became evident to them, after long and complicated research, that the fundamental cause of all the abnormalities in the psyche of the three-brained beings arising on this planet was a very definite concept, now rooted in them, that there exist, as it were, outside the essence of beings, two diametrically opposite factors—the principle of Good and the principle of Evil— which are the instigators of all their good and bad manifestations. "They further established that this universally disseminated and maleficent idea, the data for which are gradually crystallized in each of these beings during their formation in preparatory age, already dominates their common psyche by the time they reach responsible age, so that on the one hand, it becomes a means of calming themselves and justifying all their manifestations and, on the other, it is the fundamental factor impeding the possibility arising in certain of them for the perfecting of their highest beingpart. "When the righteous inhabitants of the holy planet were convinced of all this, they began to consider and deliberate among themselves how to find a way out of the situation and what they could do on their part.
"As it was related to me, they began to hold meetings



and conferences everywhere, in all the 'zarooariakhs,' to try by collective
effort to reach some decision and, after long deliberations and complicated
'balloting' by the righteous souls of each zarooariakh, as well as between
different zarooariakhs, in the end the following resolution was almost
unanimously adopted.
" 'First, to lay a petition at the feet of our Maker Creator that He in His
Providence send to the three-brained beings of the planet Earth a Messenger
from Above with all the data corresponding to such Reason as could enable
him to find on the spot a possibility of uprooting this idea, and second,
inasmuch as the appearance on the Earth of so maleficent an idea was, and
still is, the fundamental cause of the terrible fate of all the sacred highest
being-parts arising there, to venture with contrition to ask of our Common
Father not to allow the highest being-part of that terrestrial three-brained
being who was to blame for the arising of that idea to be taken on to the holy
planet, even if this highest being-body is perfected to the required gradation
of Sacred Reason, but to doom it to exist eternally on the planet "Remorse of
Conscience.
"Well, my boy, the dwellers on the holy planet had no sooner adopted this
resolution than such a 'turmoil,' as I expressed it, broke out there that even
now, not one of the Sacred Individuals who knows this epic story can recall it
without shuddering.
"This turmoil began in the following way: "As soon as the resolution was carried, it was decided, on the initiative of
the fifty chosen candidates for the Sun Absolute, to undertake to find out just
which terrestrial three-brained being—having perhaps his highest being-part
already formed in him—was responsible for the arising on your planet of this
maleficent idea.
"According to this inquiry, it turned out that the three-brained being who
gave the first impulse toward the crys



tallizing of that maleficent idea was a certain Makary Kronbernkzion, whose
highest being-part, perfected to the required gradation of Reason, was found
worthy to go and was already dwelling on the holy planet, and was even con
sidered as one of the first candidates to be taken on to the Most Most Holy
Sun Absolute.
"As I afterward heard, when this became generally known, a 'groan,' so to say, went up over the entire holy planet, and not a single righteous soul there could think about this terrible fact without remorse. "For nearly a quarter of a year they did nothing but debate this
unprecedented calamity back and forth, and in each zarooariakh commissions
and subcommissions of every kind again set to work to find a way out of the
extraordinary situation that had arisen.
"The result of it all was that they adopted the following resolution, based
on the same principles.
" 'To sustain the first common planetary resolution that was passed
concerning the highest part of Makary Kronbernkzion, but to lay at the feet of
His All-Gracious Endlessness the plea of all the dwellers on the holy planet to
mitigate that terrifying sentence. '
"And so, at the next appearance on the holy planet of our All-Gracious
Creator Endlessness, this request was laid at His feet.
"It is said that our Creator Endlessness thought for only a moment, and
then graciously consented to command this deserving soul to continue to exist
on the holy planet until the future results of his evil deed were fully known.
"In spite of the fact that this completely formed highest being-part was the
fundamental cause of the impossibility of the complete self-perfecting for all
the highest being-bodies that arise in the presences of certain three-brained
beings of your planet, our Common Father evidently gave this merciful
command because He hoped that these beings



would perhaps finally realize their errors themselves, and begin to exist as is
becoming to three-centered beings And in that case there would be no need to
inflict this terrible punishment on the highest part of that being who, without
yielding to adverse conditions independent of himself and much stronger than
his possibilities, and struggling mercilessly with his own inevitable denying
principle, had been able to perfect himself to a degree that permitted him to
attain the threshold of the Principle of everything existing in the Universe.
"Owing to the command given by our All-Gracious Creator, the highest
part of this poor Makary Kronbernkzion still exists on the holy planet and his
future now depends exclusively on the three-brained beings who have taken
your fancy.
After rather a long pause Beelzebub continued: "The information about all these events first reached me during my sixth
descent to the surface of your planet, and of course I became very interested
in it all, and began in my turn to make a detailed investigation on the spot of
this distressing story connected with the terrestrial three-brained beings.
"First of all, my boy, I consider it necessary to tell you sincerely—just you,
who will be my direct substitute—that although all the righteous dwellers on
the holy planet reached the conclusion by various most elaborate methods that
the fundamental cause of all the abnormalities of the psyche of your favorites
has always been, and still is, this maleficent idea, I myself cannot confirm this
categorically.
"It cannot be denied, however, that this fantastic idea played a large part in
the progressive 'dilution' of the psyche of these unfortunates.
"When I became interested in these events, and began to carry out my
investigations to reconstruct the history of the



arising and formation of the individuality of this Makary Kronbernkzion, many impressions were deposited in me and data were crystallized for a subjective opinion. "This special research of mine clearly showed me that although he was indeed the first to use the terms 'Good' and 'Evil,' he was not to blame that these words later acquired such a maleficent sense in the process of existence of your favorites of all subsequent generations. "Now, my boy, if I initiate you into the history of the arising and process of existence of Makary Kronbernkzion, corresponding data will perhaps be crystallized in you for an approximate representation concerning this distressing terrestrial fact. "From the time I decided to occupy myself with this history, whenever I met a qualified individual I inquired about anything that might throw light on one aspect or another of the individuality of this Makary Kronbernkzion "You will probably be interested to learn that among the first individuals I met who could give me some information on this subject was an aged being of our tribe who turned out to be very helpful In our conversation, he cleared up many things for me and indicated several excellent sources from which I later drew a great deal of useful information. "This aged being I am speaking of was none other than the uncle of that
young being of our tribe on whose account I had to descend to this planet of
yours for the first time, and who afterward became the governor of all the
beings of our tribe who were exiled to that system Ors.
"This aged being existed on the continent of Atlantis at just the same
period when Makary Kronbernkzion also existed there.
"According to all the information I gathered and my various other special methods of investigation, this terrestrial three-brained being named Makary Kronbernkzion arose on the continent of Atlantis as the result of the sacred process



of 'elmooarno' between two terrestrial beings of different sex who had just
reached responsible age.
"Since this couple had a healthy heredity in every respect, and the external
conditions of ordinary being-existence on that continent were still relatively
normal and happened to be specially favorable for this couple, the result of
this sacred process, that is, this 'son' of theirs later called Makary
Kronbernkzion, received in his presence from his very arising and during his
early childhood almost the same data required for a future responsible being
as every keschapmartnian three-brained being possesses at his arising
everywhere else on all the other planets of our Great Megalocosmos.
"And as it happened that his producers or, as is said there, his 'parents,'
wished to prepare their result to become a responsible being with a 'scientific'
career, and as they happened to find qualified guides for him, when he
reached responsible age he became a very good scientist—good of course for
the planet Earth.
"On account of his scientific achievements he was soon even considered
worthy to become a full member of the learned Society of Akhldanns
"During the process of his responsible existence, devoted entirely to
science, he came one day to a clear vision of his own significance and
sincerely realized his nullity.
"From then on, with sore grief, he meditated seriously on this realization,
and the result of his meditations was that in every part of his entire presence
the hope began to arise, and finally the conviction was definitely fixed in him,
that conscious labor and intentional suffering could transform him from a
nothing into a 'something.'
"So he then began to labor consciously, without mercy toward his denying
part, intentionally creating conditions to oppose it. Moreover he carried out
these conscious labors and created these intentional conditions particularly in
relation to his manifestations and perceptions in the field of



the duties he had assumed as a responsible being, that is to say, in his
scientific investigations.
"It was just during that period of his existence that he understood certain cosmic truths. "Well then, since in him, as in most of the three-brained beings of that
period, data were still being crystallized for engendering the being-impulse
called 'love of kind,' he decided, in order to share the truths he had discovered
with other beings around him similar to himself, to engrave on marble a
'boolmarshano' entitled 'The Affirming and Denying Influences on Man.'
"A 'boolmarshano' on the continent of Atlantis was what terrestrial
contemporary beings have replaced by what they call a 'book. '
"Later, during my sixth descent there, I had the opportunity of seeing with
my own eyes an exact copy of that boolmarshano made out of the tusks of
what are called 'chirniano,' and of deciphering it in some detail.
"It will be very interesting and instructive for you to learn how this copy of
the boolmarshano that had been engraved by Makary Kronbernkzion with his
own hand, a copy which I deciphered during my last sojourn on your planet,
remained intact until the contemporary epoch, and so I will tell you about it
briefly.
"When the original of that boolmarshano was completed, and approved
with sincere admiration by the other learned members of the Society of
Akhldanns, it was placed in the center of the 'main cathedral' of the beings
belonging to that society.
"Since the contents of this boolmarshano began to interest an ever
increasing number of the beings of that period, the leaders of the society
decided to make several copies and put one in the center of each of their
cathedrals then existing in other cities on the continent of Atlantis, as well as
on other continents.



"For this purpose, seven very exact copies of it were made from the tusks of 'chirniano. "One of these copies, as my 'spipsychoonalnian investigations' showed,
was then assigned to the cathedral of a small continent named 'Sinkraga,'
which lay not far from the continent of Grabontzi.
"During the second transapalnian perturbation to that ill-fated planet, this
small continent of Sinkraga, in the same way as Atlantis, entered within the
planet with all that was on it.
"As for the continent of Grabontzi or, as it is now called, 'Africa,' it did not
entirely disappear within the depths of the planet, but suffered the same fate
as other still existing continents, for instance Asia, that is, certain parts of it
were engulfed, and in their place others rose from beneath the waters and
became joined to the remaining parts, forming the continent as it is at the
present time.
"It seems that this copy of the boolmarshano had only just been brought to
the continent of Grabontzi to be sent on to the cathedral for which it was
intended, when that second great catastrophe befell this ill-fated planet, and
because this copy was on a part of the surface of the continent of Grabontzi
that happened to be spared, it did not enter within the planet.
"After this terrible event, the work of the 'pending saint' Makary
Kronbernkzion lay for a long time beneath the rums and was gradually
covered with 'kashiman ' It was only about thirty centuries later, when your
favorites had again multiplied and a process of reciprocal destruction had
broken out between the communities called 'Filnooanzi' and 'Plitazoorali,' that
the beings belonging to the community of Filnooanzi, while digging holes in
the hope of finding drinking water for themselves and their camels, came
across this copy and dug it out.
"And shortly afterward, when the beings of these two



communities had concluded, as has become the custom there, what they call a
'friendly peace,' and divided everything they had acquired during this process
by various means also customary there—which they term 'conquest,' 'pillage,'
'commandeering,' 'indemnities,' and so on—this discovery of theirs, which
was valued by the beings of the Earth of that period only as rare material, was
divided into halves, and each community took for itself one half of this really
great creation.
"One of the halves of this copy, passing from one group to another for
various reasons, finally, after seven centuries, fell into the hands of the
Egyptian high priests.
"This strange and singular combination of several chirniano tusks, by now
incomprehensible to them, became a sacred relic, and existed there as such
until the period when the Persian king about whom I once told you went there
with his hordes and made a 'clean sweep,' as is said, of that unfortunate Egypt.
"Then this same half of the copy of the boolmarshano happened to be sent
to the continent of Asia and, passing from hand to hand, came by inheritance
from his grandfather into the possession of that Aisorian priest at whose house
I saw it for the first time in the middle of my sixth descent there.
"As for the other half of that work, unequaled before or since, it also
passed from hand to hand for various reasons, and by chance reached one of
the central regions of Asia, where during what they call an 'earthquake' it
finally disappeared within the planet, though not very far beneath its surface
"Here, by the way, I must tell you how I obtained all the information about
these events which had happened long before, and in general about certain
other similar events, which I am now passing on to you.
"I have already told you that during my sixth descent to



the planet Earth I became a professional 'physician-hypnotist,' and that I
studied the strange psyche of your favorites with the help among other things
of 'hypnotism,' that is, through a specific property acquired in their psyche.
"During this period of my activities among your favorites, I specially
prepared some of them in a certain way, making some of these subjects into
what in former epochs they called 'Pythias,' and contemporary beings call
'mediums.'
"Those three-brained beings can be transformed into 'Pythias,' or
'mediums,' in whom either spontaneously, just through an accidental
combination of the surrounding conditions, or intentionally, through the action
of another consciousness, the inner functioning of the planetary body can
adapt itself to every alteration of the general psyche during sudden changes in
the blood circulation Consequently, in such subjects nothing interferes with
the free functioning of various particularities of their general psyche,
consciously or unconsciously directed from outside, or hinders the automatic
predominance of the data still present in your favorites for genuine being
consciousness—data and particularities whose functioning as a whole
constitutes what they call the 'subconscious.'
"Owing to many factors formed in their subconscious, a particularity of the
common psyche of three-brained beings has accidentally survived, which can
function under certain conditions and is called the 'seeing and sensing of what
has occurred in the remote past.
"And so, my boy, when in the course of my sixth descent I learned the
origin of that distressing common-cosmic history which occurred there on
your planet, I undertook to investigate it on the spot and to clarify for myself
the individuality of this Makary Kronbernkzion, and because a very long time
had elapsed since that event, and every 'kaltzanooarnian' trace of the being
who was to blame for it all had absolutely vanished, I decided, in addition to
the



ordinary forms of investigation, to have recourse to this 'spipsychoonalnian' means as well. "Among these 'spipsychoonalnian' means of mine, I also resorted to what
is called 'mediumism,' making use of that special property of the mediums I
had prepared.
"During my investigations relating to the personality and activities of this
Makary Kronbernkzion, it suddenly seemed likely that 'something' that had a
close connection with him still existed on the surface of that planet, so I
began to look for that 'something' also by the same means.
"Having learned in this way that half of the copy of the original
boolmarshano created by Makary Kronbernkzion was in the possession of an
Aisorian priest, and that this priest existed on the continent of Asia in the
locality called 'Urmia,' I went there and, having found him, soon ascertained
that he did indeed possess what he called a large 'shapeless mass of ivory' that
he considered very ancient and valuable.
"Although after a brief discussion he agreed to show it to me, he was
unwilling to sell it at any price. However, at the end of several days of talk
and persuasion, he allowed me to make an alabaster copy of it which I took
away with me.
"As for the second half, I soon found out where it was by the same
method, but I had a great deal of trouble and bother to obtain it in order to
decipher its contents.
"Although, as I said, this second half had not yet had time to enter deeply
into the planet, it had gone too far down to be recovered by ordinary means
"But the main trouble was that it was located near a center populated by
your favorites, and I therefore had to foresee everything and take all suitable
measures in advance to prevent any of them from learning, or even
suspecting, anything about it.
"Among the measures I took was the purchase from



various large and small proprietors of plots of land round about the given
place, and I had it dug exclusively by foreign laborers, under the pretext of
sinking a shaft for what are called 'copper mines.'
"And so, my boy! After I had found by these means both halves of the copy of
the creation of the 'pending saint' Makary Kronbernkzion, I took them to a city
in the country now called 'Turkestan,' which was at that period the chief place
of my existence, and began deciphering the inscriptions and signs engraved on
the boolmarshano, setting forth the scientific thesis by Makary Kronbernkzion
under the title of 'The Affirming and Denying Influences on Man. '
"When we return home, I will try to recall and tell you as nearly as possible
word for word the whole contents of this great work of the Reason and, as is
said, of the 'hand' of a three-brained being, but meanwhile I will expound to
you only that part of the text in which Makary Kronbernkzion employed for
the first time the idea of Good and Evil, by which he symbolized the forces
which are the basis for the formation of the presence, as well as of the
formation of the stream of successive states, of every relatively independent
cosmic arising, and thus of course of every being.
"If the ideas recorded on this boolmarshano were put into ordinary
language, they could be expressed as follows:
'It is evident that we men, like all units existing in the Universe, are
formed and always consist of the same three independent forces, by means of
which the process of reciprocal maintenance of everything existing is
actualized, that is, the following three universal forces.
'The first of these forces continually arises from causes appearing within
the Prime Source itself from the effect of the pressure of new arisings and,
issuing from it by momentum, flows out of that Prime Source.
" 'The second universal force is what this first force be



comes when, after having spent the momentum it had, it strives to reblend with the source of its arising, according to the fundamental cosmic law "the effects of a cause must always re-enter the cause. " 'In the general process of reciprocal maintenance, these two forces are entirely independent, and in their manifestations always and in everything keep their own properties and characteristics. " 'The first of these two fundamental forces, the one that is always compelled to manifest outside the source of its arising, must constantly involve, and the second, on the contrary, in striving to reblend with the cause of its arising, must always and in everything evolve. " 'Since the first of these three independent forces arises from vivifying actions proceeding in the very foundation of the Cause of everything that exists and thus receives in its presence the germ of that same power of manifesting vivifyingness, it may be considered as "Good," that is, as a factor for the actualizing of the backward-flowing effects, which in relation to this first force can and must be considered as "Evil." 'Moreover, the first force, as it is manifested from inevitable and compelling causes arising in the Prime Source itself, can from this point of view be considered as passive. 'The second, backward-flowing force, because it must constantly resist, in order to have the possibility of re-entering its cause, or at least of withstanding the contrary flow of the first, passive force, which has received its momentum from the Prime Source, must be regarded as active. " 'And as for the third universal force, this is nothing but the result of the
clash, everywhere and in everything, of these two fundamental, descending
and ascending independent forces.
" 'Although this third independent force is only the result of the first two fundamental forces, it is nevertheless the



spiritualizing and reconciling principle of every cosmic formation. 'And it is the spiritualizing and reconciling principle of every cosmic
world-formation because it arises and must exist in them as a presence as long
as there exist the results of diverse unusual mutual resistances occurring
between the two fundamental forces flowing in entirely opposite direction. '
"And so, my boy, it was in this sense and in this meaning that the terms 'Good' and 'Evil' were used for the first time by that unfortunate Makary Kronbernkzion. "Thanks to his boolmarshano and to other data elucidated by me on the
spot, my own personal opinion was crystallized in me both about Makary
Kronbernkzion himself and everything else, and was entirely different from
the conclusion reached by the righteous dwellers on the holy planet as a result
of their investigations, which though perhaps wisely conducted were not
direct.
"I repeat, although the idea of external Good and Evil arose there for the
first time owing to the individuality of this Makary Kronbernkzion, in my
opinion he was not to blame for its taking such a maleficent form.
"However it may have been, my boy, the detailed and impartial research I
made on the spot brought to light the following:
"When that idea had gradually taken on this maleficent form, it became for
the psyche of your favorites what is called a 'determining factor' for the
crystallization of data in their common presence for the fantastic notion that
there exist, as it were, outside of them objective sources of 'Good' and 'Evil'
which act upon their essence From then on, other peculiar data began to be
crystallized in their general psyche—at first spontaneously and later owing to
their strange consciousness—which engender the conviction, through
automatic being-associations, that the causes of all



their manifestations, both good and bad, are not to be found in themselves, in their own criminal essence-egoism, but in some external influence not depending on them at all. "The fundamental harm ensuing from this fantastic idea for all these
unfortunates is that, thanks as always to the abnormal conditions of ordinary
being-existence established by them themselves, data cease to be crystallized
in them for engendering what is called a 'being-world-view with diverse
aspects', and instead of this a 'world-view' is formed in them based
exclusively on that maleficent idea of external Good and Evil.
"And indeed at the present time, your favorites base all questions without
exception—those about ordinary being-existence as well as those about self
perfecting and about 'philosophies' and 'sciences' of every kind, and of course
their innumerable 'religious teachings,' not to mention their notorious 'morals,'
'politics,' 'laws,' 'ethics,' and so on— exclusively on that fantastic and for them
in the objective sense pernicious idea.
"And now, my boy, to conclude all I have said about this idea, I shall tell
you how the beings of our tribe, who were exiled on that peculiar planet,
involuntarily became participants in the arising of a certain comical story,
then you will, I am sure, obtain an almost exact representation of that famous
notion of your favorites about 'Good' and 'Evil. '
"The beings of our tribe were the involuntary cause of the final fixation of
this weird notion in the process of ordinary existence of these strange three
brained beings in the following way:
"I have already told you that in the beginning, many beings of our tribe
happened to exist on that planet and to mix with the ancestors of these
favorites of yours, and even to have friendly relations with some of them.
"I must remark that in those days there was absolutely no intimation of this tragicomic story which I am about to



tell you, unless it was in the fact that shortly before our tribe left that planet, a
notion appeared and was current among the beings there, but only among the
particularly naive, that the beings of our tribe were 'immortal.'
"This notion no doubt appeared because the beings of our tribe had a
duration of existence much longer than theirs, and hence instances of the
sacred rascooarno among us were rare. And it may even be that in that period
this sacred process did not chance to occur to any of our tribe.
"I repeat that, aside from what I have just said, nothing special took place
while our tribe was existing among them.
"But afterward, when for certain reasons the desire was expressed from
Above that as few as possible of the beings of our tribe should exist on that
planet, most of us emigrated to other planets of the same system, with scarcely
any of our beings remaining among your favorites It was only then that this
comical story began there, in which, even now, the real names of certain
beings of our tribe are involved.
"The events that gave rise to this singular coincidence, whereby these
strange three-brained beings connected the names of beings of our tribe with
this fantastic idea of theirs, were as follows:
"Soon after our beings departed from that planet, a certain Armanatoorga,
who existed in the epoch when the Tikliamishian civilization was flourishing,
and who was by profession a priest—and even regarded by others as one of
the 'learned priests'—was the first to build up a whole 'religious teaching' on
this maleficent idea.
"In that 'religious teaching' of his he explained, among other things, that
certain invisible spirits dwelling among them spread 'external' good and evil,
and compelled men to take in and manifest this 'good' and this 'evil ' The
spirits that were spreaders of 'good' were called 'angels,' and those that were
spreaders of 'evil' were called 'devils. '
"The 'angels,' bearers or spreaders of 'good'—that is, of



the most high and most divine—being themselves also high and divine, could never be seen or sensed by men. "But the 'devils,' on the contrary, being of the lowest origin, that is, coming
from the 'bottomless pit,' could be seen by men.
"And if men did not actually see the 'devils,' this was only because of the
devils' 'suggestion', and hence the more 'righteous' people became, the more
visible were the 'devils' to their organs of sight.
"When this new religious teaching became widely known, certain of your
favorites, learning from the tales of their ancestors of the existence among
them in former times of supposedly immortal beings who had suddenly
disappeared, decided to spread the rumor that these beings were obviously
those very 'devils' who, foreseeing the arising of a true religious teaching and
fearing that people would perhaps find them out, made themselves invisible
but, in fact, continued to exist among them.
"It was then that the real names of certain members of our tribe, which also
chanced to reach the beings of the epoch when this religious teaching
appeared, acquired a quite special significance and were passed down from
generation to generation even to your contemporary favorites.
"They continue to associate these names with all kinds of fantastic 'roles'
which, according to their imagination, are the attributes of those clans of
devil-beings, organized as it were by our Creator Himself, and sent to their
planet to mock them.
"In short, in the imagination of these three-brained freaks of our
Megalocosmos, a devil is an invisible 'somebody' who dwells among them on
their planet at the command of our Creator All-Maintainer for certain of His
aims.
"These devils are obliged to suggest to men-beings, by every sort of truth
and falsehood, and to compel them to manifest at every step, those
innumerable 'villainies' that



have already become, as it were, a particularity of their presence. "Not one of them, of course, suspects that if villainies of all kinds go on
among them, it is only because, by existing unworthily, they permit the
formation in them of their inner 'evil god' I called 'self-calming,' which has
absolute dominion over the whole of their psyche, and for which alone this
idea of 'external' good and evil is necessary.
"At all events, this fantastic idea of theirs brought considerable publicity to our incomparable Lucifer for the praise and glory of his name, for nowhere in the Universe are his talents so praised and glorified as by these favorites of yours.
At this point in Beelzebub's tales, one of the ship's attendants entered that part
of the cosmic ship Karnak where the conversations were taking place and
gave Beelzebub a leitoochanbros, and on leaving, he turned to everyone and
joyfully announced that the reflections of the sphere of the planet Karatas
were already visible.



CHAPTER 45
In the opinion of Beelzebub, man's extraction
of electricity from Nature, and its destruction
during its use, is one of the chief causes of the
shortening of human life
AFTER BEELZEBUB had listened to the contents of the leitoochanbros and had
put it on the "sonorous," rather like a set of shelves, next to him, he again
sighed deeply and went on speaking as follows:
"It would be only half a calamity for our common Megalocosmos if the
abnormal conditions of ordinary existence of the three-brained beings of this
planet Earth had only had bad consequences for them alone, that is, for
themselves as three-brained beings, and for the possibility of completely
perfecting the 'higher being-bodies' that have had the extreme misfortune to
have arisen within them or which may arise within them in the future.
"But now the whole terror lies in this, that their abnormal existence is
already having a repercussion and a harmful influence on the normal
existence of the three-brained beings breeding on other planets—belonging, it
is true, to the same solar system—and also on the possibilities of perfecting
the higher being-parts coated in the common presence of these beings.
"I happened to learn about this distressing fact of a common-cosmic
character just before I left that solar system Ors forever.
"Of everything that enabled me to recognize this distressing fact and to crystallize in my common presence the 'imperishable' being-data for my unswerving conviction of its



truth, what will interest you the most is that I was greatly helped in this by
none other than the 'result' or, as your favorites would say, the 'son,' of my
essence-friend Gornahoor Harharkh, the young, conscious individual
Gornahoor Raoorkh who, like his producer, had taken as the aim of his
existence the detailed study of the properties of the omnipresent cosmic
substance Okidanokh, and who also had gradually become worthy to be
considered one of the common-cosmic, learned three-brained beings of the
highest degree.
"Do you know what, my boy? Since all the events and conversations
which served to elucidate and crystallize factors in me for an unshakable
conviction about this distressing, common-cosmic fact are very interesting
and might be very instructive for you, and since as yet only the reflections of
the sphere of our dear Karatas have become visible, I will tell you about this
in somewhat greater detail.
"In order to give you a fuller representation of why it was that data were
crystallized in my Being for verifying and thoroughly comprehending this
fact, I shall tell you about what took place in its exact order, beginning with
the moment, while still on this planet of yours, when I first received the news
of my full pardon.
"As soon as I heard about this special, most glorious act of grace toward
me, I of course decided to return at the first opportunity to the place of my
arising, so dear to my essence.
"But it was necessary for me first to ascend to the planet Mars in order to
make thorough preparations for such a long journey.
"Several days later I left your planet forever, and returned to the planet
Mars, as always on our ship Occasion.
"Soon after arriving there, we received a command from Above that I and
all the other beings of our tribe who wished to return to the place of their
arising should go by the ship Occasion to the planet Saturn, where the large
intersystem



ship Omnipresent would land and take us all to our destination.
"Nevertheless, I had to stay for a certain time on the planet Mars in order
to settle all my personal affairs, and to give various orders concerning the
beings of our tribe And it was just at this time that I was told that the 'toof
nef-tef very much wished to see me.
" 'Toof-nef-tef is the name given on the planet Mars to the chief of all the
three-brained beings breeding there, that is, he corresponds to the being who,
on your planet, is called 'king. '
"I had known this toof-nef-tef, or king, in his youth, when he was only a
'plef-perf-noof' A plef-perf-noof is almost the same as a zirlikner on our
planet and a physician on your planet Earth.
"In this connection, I should mention that on almost all the planets of our
Great Universe, and likewise on the other planets of the solar system Ors, a
being becomes a chief over other beings by his merit, and most often by the
merit he has acquired as a plef-perf-noof, or physician—that is, a physician of
the spirit as well as of the body.
"My first meeting with the Martian toof-nef-tef took place soon after we
arrived in this solar system and settled on the planet Mars He was then a plef
perf-noof on Just that part of the surface of the planet where I and all who
accompanied me had established our place of residence.
"Later on, while existing on various parts of the surface of that planet in
the capacity of plef-perf-noof, he became worthy to be the head of all the
beings breeding on the planet Mars, and when he was nearing the state of the
sacred Ishmetch, he desired to return to that part of his planet where he had
spent his youth And that is why this former plef-perf-noof, now the toof-nef
tef, happened at that time to be near the place of my residence on Mars.
"This Martian toof-nef-tef was already, according to the



notions of your favorites, an extremely old being, by the time-calculation of the planet Mars, he was about twelve thousand years old, and only a little less by the time-calculation of the Earth. "Here I must tell you that on the planet Mars the duration of existence of beings is in general almost the same as that of the three-centered beings of all the other planets of our Megalocosmos, excepting of course those beings who are formed directly from the first tetartocosmoses, the duration of whose existence may be three times longer. "The three-brained beings arising and existing on the planet Mars, as well as those on all the planets of our Megalocosmos where the process of existence is normal for three-brained beings, have the full possibility of reaching the state of the sacred Ishmetch, that is, the state in which the existence of a being, as regards the most great cosmic Iraniranumange, becomes dependent only on substances that arise directly from the manifestations of the Most Holy Prime Source Itself, whereas for other beings, their existence always depends on cosmic substances that arise from the results of all corresponding center-of-gravity concentrations of the common-cosmic fundamental Ansanbaluiazar. "And when they reach this state of the sacred Ishmetch and the Reason of their highest part is already perfected up to the required gradation of the Sacred Scale of Objective Reason, the process of the sacred rascooarno takes place in them only by their own wish, and furthermore, their highest beingbody is taken directly to the Holy Planet Purgatory. "And so, my boy, when I returned to the planet Mars from the planet Earth and was hurriedly winding up my affairs there, I was informed that the toof-nef-tef of the planet wished to see me personally. "This request of the honorable toof-nef-tef was transmitted to me by our Ahoon by means of what is called there a 'kelleh-e-ofoo' or, as they say on the planet Earth, a 'note. '



"The text of this kelleh-e-ofoo was as follows: " 'Your Right Reverence, I have heard that you have become worthy to
receive from our Common Father Creator full pardon for the transgressions of
your youth, and that you are now leaving my native land forever For this
reason, I, an old being, very much wish to see you and bless you personally
for the last time, and also, through your person, to thank all the beings of your
tribe for their constant good relations with the beings of my native land for so
many years.
"At the end of this kelleh-e-ofoo was the postscript. " 'I would come myself to your house but, as you know, the size of my
planetary body does not permit this, and hence I must beg you not to refuse to
come to my "fal-feh-foof." '
"In Martian speech, my boy, fal-feh-foof means a 'dwelling. '
"I must mention here that the three-brained beings of the planet Mars
knew our genuine nature from the very beginning, and also the true reason
why we were compelled to dwell on their planet.
"In this they were unlike the three-brained beings of the Earth, who never
knew anything and never even suspected who we were and why we existed
there.
"And so, my boy, when I received this invitation from the honorable toof
nef-tef, I of course decided to go to him without delay. When I arrived there,
after all the prescribed ceremonies and exchange of courtesies, this, in the full
sense of the word, great toof-nef-tef turned to me, as we were talking, with a
request. And this request was the cause of the crystallization in me of the data
that led to my unshakable conviction that the results ensuing from the
abnormal existence of the three-brained beings on your planet had already
begun to act harmfully on the ordinary existence of the three-brained beings
arising and existing on the planet Mars, as



regards their 'potency' to perfect themselves as is proper to all three-brained beings. "I shall try to repeat to you almost word for word in our own speech the
contents of this request of the great toof-nef-tef.
"He spoke as follows:
" 'Your Right Reverence!
'Thanks to the most gracious pardon granted to you from Above, you
have regained the right freely to fulfill your justly merited wishes And thanks
to this all-enfolding grace, you have all the possibilities, once more, of
becoming what you might long ago have been by virtue of your former merits
as regards Reason And of course from now on, Your Right Reverence, you
will undoubtedly meet various Individuals, corresponding to your Being, who
have already reached the highest gradations of Reason.
'And so, I take the liberty of addressing myself to you, as an old friend,
with the request that on meeting these Individuals you should remember me,
an old being, and not forget to ask their opinion about a fact that in recent
years has almost constantly aroused disturbing associations in all my
spiritualized parts, and that when you have learned their opinion you will not
fail to communicate it to me somehow or other on a suitable occasion.
" 'The point is that during the last few "ftofoos" I established very
definitely that, among the beings of our planet, the "noorfooftafaf" increases
with each "ftofoo," and along with this, I observed in them a proportional
decrease in the intensity of their potency of active mentation.
"By the way, my boy, the expression 'noorfooftafaf signifies on the planet Mars something like what on the Earth is called 'will-lessness .'
"And the toof-nef-tef continued: 'When I first discovered this fact, so deplorable for the beings of our planet, I began to ponder intensively to seek



its cause, in order to be able to give corresponding indications to those beings
who have entrusted themselves to me in their struggle to uproot this
lamentable factor recently arisen in their common presence, but in spite of
meditating very often and long on this question that constantly agitates me,
until now I have not been able to elucidate for myself, even approximately,
where the trouble lies and what measures must be taken to destroy this evil.'
"Thus ended the request of the honorable toof-nef-tef of the planet Mars,
and of course, my boy, I there and then promised my old friend to inquire
about all this at my first meeting with a corresponding Individual and to
communicate the reply to him without fail.
"Several Martian days after this interview, we left that hospitable planet
forever and ascended to the planet Saturn.
"No sooner had we arrived on the planet Saturn than the chief of our tribe
there came to communicate to us the contents of an etherogram he had just
received, announcing that the big intersystem ship Omnipresent would not
land on the planet Saturn until early in the next 'khreh-khree-khra. '
" 'Khreh-khree-khra,' on the planet Saturn, means a period of time
determined by a certain position occupied by this planet in relation, on the one
hand, to the sun of its system, and on the other, to another planet of this
system called 'Neptune.'
"In one Saturnian year there are seven of these definitely established
periods, and each of them has its own name.
"As there still remained, by the time-calculation of the planet Mars, almost
half a 'fooss' before the next 'khreh-khree-khra' or, by the time-calculation of
your favorites, about a month and a half, we decided to organize our ordinary
being-existence in the meantime in a more or less suitable manner.
"Some of our beings remained on the ship Occasion itself, others found accommodation in the dwellings placed at our



disposal by the amiable beings of the planet Saturn; and I, with Ahoon, went
to 'Rirkh,' the large populated center of three-brained beings where my friend
Gornahoor Harharkh existed.
"On the evening of our arrival there, I asked this essence-friend of mine
during friendly conversation how the existence of his heir was proceeding; I
was referring to my dear 'external kesdjanian result' or, as your favorites
would say, my 'godson,' Gornahoor Raoorkh.
"He thanked me and said that Raoorkh's existence was proceeding quite
well, and that he had already become his heir in all respects, having even
made the aim of his responsible existence, as he himself had done, the
detailed study of the omnipresent substance Okidanokh.
"After pausing a little, he added that as regards the knowledge he had
attained of the cosmic substance Okidanokh, his heir had already, as he
expressed it, 'smelled out its very essence.'
"He then said that, thanks to the results of his heir's scientific attainments,
not only had all the factors for every conviction previously crystallized in his
own being through long years of persevering labors now been totally
decrystallized, but he had even destroyed all his inventions for investigating
this omnipresent cosmic substance, including his famous 'nonradiating lamp',
and, with a deep sigh, he concluded:
'I am now in full agreement with the opinion of the "result of my all"
that it was the greatest misfortune for me to have been occupied so long with
this, in the objective sense, absolutely "irredeemable sin. " '
"While conversing further on various topics we came to speak, in
accordance with the flow of associations of being-mentation, about the three
brained beings breeding on the planet Earth.
"You remember, I have already told you that my friend



Gornahoor Harharkh was always kept informed of my observations on their strange psyche, and that I even sent him, as well as your uncle Tooilan, copies of certain of my notes. "So, as we were talking about these three-brained beings who have taken your fancy, Gornahoor Harharkh asked me among other things. " 'Please tell me, my friend, is it possible that the duration of existence of these unfortunates still continues to diminish?' "I was beginning to explain to him the present state of affairs regarding this question, and the new data I had collected on that abnormality, when just at that moment his 'result,' Gornahoor Raoorkh himself, entered the room "Although the newcomer had exactly the same exterior as his producer, he was very virile and full of youthful fire. "When he had taken his place on his perch, in the manner proper to the
three-brained beings of that planet, he welcomed me, as is customary for
them, in an angelically musical voice, with all sorts of kind wishes and self
satisfying being-feelings.
"And in conclusion he declared, somewhat exaltedly. " 'Although you are only my "kesdjanian father," yet in view of the fact that you have fulfilled with such full awareness the divine obligations toward me taken upon yourself during my "khri-khra-khri," there have been crystallized in my common presence with respect to you data equivalent to those which should be in the common presence of every three-brained being toward his own producer, and it is without doubt because of this that I remember you so often in my thoughts, and each time wish that you may always have conditions that lead, in the objective sense, to a good and happy future. ' " 'Khri-khra-khri,' my boy, is the name given on the planet Saturn to that sacred ceremony which is similar to what is called 'baptism' on the planet Earth.
"You probably did not understand what I meant when I



told you that Gornahoor Raoorkh took his place on his perch. "The point is that, because of their outer coating, the three-brained beings
of this planet gradually acquired the habit of resting in only one posture, that
is, after stooping in a special way, they let the whole weight of their planetary
body rest on their lower extremities, and for this manner of resting, it became
necessary for them to be at a certain height Hence the three-brained beings
there have the practice of putting up, at a certain height in the rooms where
they exist, special bars which they call 'perches. '
"I may as well add that these 'perches' of theirs are usually embellished
with various knick-knacks or carved with all kinds of designs, just as is done
by your favorites, who manifest the same weakness in regard to what they call
their 'furniture.'
"And so, having taken his place on his perch and expressed his welcome,
my dear 'external kesdjanian result,' or 'godson,' Gornahoor Raoorkh, began to
take part in our conversation.
"Well, my boy, in the course of general conversation on various topics, I
asked my godson, among other things, the reason for the crystallizing in his
presence of data for engendering his serious interest in elucidating all aspects
of the omnipresent cosmic substance Okidanokh, thanks to which he had
become worthy, like his producer, of making great cosmic discoveries When
young Raoorkh replied in detail to my question, it became clear to me that the
abnormal existence of your favorites was already acting harmfully on the
normal existence and the conscious self-perfecting of beings breeding on the
planet Mars, and at the same time, thanks to this detailed reply of his, based
on scientific foundations, I also elicited data for clarifying the question which
my old Martian friend, the great toof-nef-tef, had addressed to me.



"I will try, my boy, to reproduce for you in our language, as exactly as possible, the quintessence of this reply of his. "After having thought a little about what I had asked him, Gornahoor Raoorkh replied with deep seriousness. " 'Early in my existence, at the period when I was still preparing to be a
responsible being, I devoted the greater part of my time—as is proper to all
three-brained beings at that age—to practicing in order to acquire the potency
to "deliberate actively for a long time", and it happened by itself that during
the intervals for necessary rest, I used to occupy myself with the various
experimental apparatuses of my producer.
" 'And it was at that period of my existence that I noticed more than once
that on certain days the force and level of my active mentation were
perceptibly lower.
" 'This discovery aroused in me a subjective interest that engendered in my
presence the urgent impulse to acquire a thorough cognizance of the cause of
this fact From then on, I began to pay attention both to myself and to what
took place around me in order to seek out the causes, and after one "khree" I
became completely convinced that this undesirable state occurred in me each
time our large "life-chakhan," or "dynamo," was in operation.
" 'It was precisely this fact, first observed by me at that time, which was
the cause of my growing interest in the omnipresent cosmic substance and of
my deeply absorbing study of its details.
" 'My experiments, from the very beginning, brought me an incalculable
number of proofs of all kinds, both for myself and for others, that the
omnipresent substance Okidanokh is a part of the common presence of the
atmosphere of our planet, and evidently of the presence of the atmosphere of
other planets as well, and that it takes part in the arising of all planetary and
surplanetary formations—including of



course the "khraprkhalikhrokhnian" part of every being— and in the
maintenance of their existence.
'In the course of my further experimental elucidations, I also became
entirely certain that although our solar system, like all the other solar systems
of the Great Universe, has its own "Ansanbaluiazar," and that each planet,
with its atmosphere, is the specific place of concentration of one or another
class of cosmic substances of the given "common-system Ansanbaluiazar,"
the cosmic substance Okidanokh is nonetheless an indispensable and even
predominant part of the presence of each planet.
'And later my experiments also showed me that, thanks to the common
universal equilibrium, this cosmic substance is concentrated in every system
in a strictly corresponding proportion, and is also distributed in strictly
determined proportions among the atmospheres of all the planets of the given
system Consequently, whenever this universal substance is used up in any
part of atmospheric space, either by accident or design, it must without fail be
replenished to restore the equilibrium of its proportions in the atmosphere,
and this takes place by the flowing in of this substance from other places And
this balancing transposition of Okidanokh must be effected not only from one
place to another in the atmosphere of each planet, but also from the
atmosphere of one planet to that of another, if in this other, for some reason,
more than its established norm is used up.
" 'Finally, I very definitely made clear to my Reason from every aspect,
and proved to others, that the omnipresent cosmic substance Okidanokh,
present in our atmosphere and constantly being replenished, is necessary for
the common presence of our planet and is the most important factor for every
kind of arising and maintenance of existence, and also that the essence of
every "relatively independent" intra-planetary and surplanetary formation, as
well as the essence of beings of every brain-system and external coating, de



pends on this substance, and I even proved that the possibility for threebrained beings to perfect themselves and ultimately to blend with the Prime Cause of everything existing depends exclusively on this substance. " 'I repeat, as a result of all my experimental elucidations, I very definitely
cognized for myself, and acquired indisputable data for proving from every
aspect to all the beings like myself around me, that the destruction of the
omnipresent cosmic substance Okidanokh in the presence of our planet and of
its atmosphere is almost equivalent to the conscious destruction of all the
labors and results of the Most Sacred First Cause of everything that exists '
"With these words, captivated by his theme, my dear godson, the young
and high-spirited Gornahoor Raoorkh, finished his discourse.
"In the middle of Gornahoor Raoorkh's explanations about the properties of
the omnipresent cosmic substance Okidanokh, and the inevitable
consequences of its extraction from the common presence of every planet,
and of its ensuing destruction, a suspicion arose in me, and all sorts of
pictures gradually appeared in my memory connected with impressions
perceived during my personal sojourns among your favorites and in the period
of my close observations from the planet Mars of their ordinary being
existence—showing how at different periods they repeatedly obtained this
substance or its separate parts from the nature of their planet and used them
for their various naively egoistic aims .
"And when, during Gornahoor Raoorkh's further explanations,
remembered by association the request of the great toof-nef-tef of the planet
Mars, I became aware with all my being and without the least doubt, of all the
maleficent consequences of this manifestation of the three-brained beings of
your planet.
I



"They have named the totality and the separate parts of this substance,
sacred for them also, differently at different periods, and at the present time
they name the result of the blending and reciprocal destruction of two parts of
this omnipresent substance 'electricity. '
"And indeed, although several times in earlier epochs they had already
discovered—of course, thanks always to an accidental chain of
circumstances—various means of extracting from the nature of their planet,
and using for their various, as I have called them, 'naively egoistic aims,' the
separate parts of this omnipresent substance, absolutely necessary for normal
cosmic processes, yet never have they destroyed so much of it as in recent
times
"So, in this way, thanks to the explanations of my 'external kesdjanian
result,' I became absolutely convinced of the maleficent action, already begun,
of the results of the abnormal ordinary being-existence of the three-brained
beings who have taken your fancy, and furthermore, the question disturbing
my old friend resolved itself, namely, why during recent times it had become
more and more difficult for the three-brained beings of the planet Mars to
perfect themselves.
"As for the manner in which this question was resolved, I might say that it
happened just as described, in reference to similar cases, in a rarely quoted
saying of our esteemed Mullah Nasr Eddin:
'You never know who will help you to get out of a galosh.'
"In fact, for the resolution of this question, my old friend had in mind
Individuals with quite other data and possibilities than those of my friends on
Saturn, who were simply ordinary three-brained beings He probably did not
suspect that as regards such questions, these ordinary three-brained beings,
who acquire information about all sorts of real cosmic facts thanks only to
their 'being-partkdolgduty,' are



in most cases more competent than any of the angels or cherubim with their
ready-made Being who, though perfected in Reason to high gradations, may
nonetheless, as regards practical confrontation, appear to be merely such
individuals as our always respected Mullah Nasr Eddin describes in the
following words.
" 'Never will he understand the sufferings of another, who has not
experienced them himself, though he have divine Reason and the nature of a
genuine devil!' "
At this point in Beelzebub's tales, there were diffused, all along the
intersystem ship Karnak, artificially produced vibrations which had the
property of penetrating into the common presence of all the passengers of the
vessel and acting on what are called the "wandering nerves" of the stomach.
This artificially produced phenomenon was an announcement to the
passengers that it was time to assemble in the common what is called
"djameechoonatra," a sort of "monastic refectory" in which the second being
food was collectively taken.



CHAPTER 46
Beelzebub explains to his grandson the
significance of the form and sequence which
he chose for expounding the information
concerning men
AFTER THE PROCESS of taking in the second being-food, Beelzebub, on
leaving the "djameechoonatra," did not immediately return to the place where
their conversations were usually held, but went first to his "kesshah," or
"cabin," in order to cool his already extremely decrepit tail with a certain
liquid, which was a measure to which he had to resort from time to time on
account of his great age.
When, on returning from his kesshah, he silently entered that section of
the ship Karnak where they usually spent their time, he saw the following
unexpected picture.
His beloved grandson Hassein was standing in a corner with his back
turned, his hands covering his eyes, weeping Beelzebub, deeply moved,
quickly approached Hassein and, in a voice full of anxiety, asked him.
"What is the matter, my dear boy? Are you really weeping?"
Hassein wished to answer, but it was obvious that the sobbing of his
planetary body prevented him from speaking.
Only after a rather long time, when his planetary body was a little calmer,
did he say, gazing at his grandfather with very sad eyes, yet with a smile of
affection.
"Don't worry about me, dear Grandfather, this state will soon pass.
"During these last 'dianosks' I have actively pondered a great deal, and in
all probability, from this unaccustomed



new tempo of functioning, the general tempo of functioning of my whole presence has changed. "And now, until this new tempo of my mentation harmonizes with the
already established tempos of my common functioning, such abnormalities as
this weeping will probably proceed in me.
"I must confess, my dear Grandfather, that the fundamental cause of this
state in my common presence was the picture, evoked by association in my
mentation, of the situation and destiny of those ill-fated higher being-bodies
which, owing to various chance happenings, arise and remain half-formed in
the common presence of the terrestrial three-brained beings.
"These associative thoughts, accompanied by a growing impulse of
sadness, began in the djameechoonatra during the sacred absorption of the
second being-food, thoughts about them arose in my mentation by association
when I was filled to overflowing with joy from all that took place there.
"And then it began to think in me concerning those ill-fated three-brained
beings about whom you have been giving me so much information lately, that
it is only thanks to the consequences of the properties of that 'something,' ac
cursed for them, implanted in the common presence of their ancestors—for
reasons not depending in any way on their essence but only on the lack of
foresight of certain Most High Sacred Individuals—that not only the higher
being-bodies coated in them but also they themselves, as ordinary beings, are
deprived forever of the possibility of experiencing that bliss which arises in
the presence of all kinds of relatively independent individuals during the
common sacred absorption of the second being-food, in which we have just
taken part. "
When Hassein finished speaking, Beelzebub looked long



and steadily into his eyes, and then, with a smile that revealed a being
impulse of love, he said:
"Now I see that during these last 'dianosks' you did indeed actively ponder
a great deal or, as certain of your contemporary favorites would express it,
during this time 'you did not inwardly sleep.' Let us sit down again in our
usual places and speak about the subject I once promised to take up and
which will be wholly appropriate to the present occasion. "
When they were seated and Ahoon had also arrived, Beelzebub continued
as follows:
"First of all I shall begin by expressing in words the impulse of joy
concerning you which is now arising within my common presence I
personally am very, very glad about this crisis which has occurred and is still
continuing in you.
"I am glad chiefly because the sincere weeping that I saw being manifested
at just this period of your existence when, according to the laws of the great
Heropass, you are on the threshold of the being of a responsible being—that
is, at just the age when all the data necessary for those functionings that
constitute the individuality of a three-brained being during his responsible
existence are being crystallized, and when they acquire a harmonious 'tempo'
in the common functioning—gives me the assurance that the relative aware
ness or even merely the 'sensation' that you may have of this being-joy of
mine, which at first glance is not logical, will be very useful and in fact
indispensable for you later, as for all three-brained beings who have reached
responsible age I shall therefore first of all explain it to you.
"Your weeping also gives me the assurance that in your future responsible
existence, your common presence will contain those precious being-data for
feeling which are the foundation of the essence of every bearer of divine
Reason and which are even formulated by our Common Father in words
placed over the chief entrance of the Holy Planet Purgatory.



" 'ONLY HE MAY ENTER HERE WHO ENTERS INTO THE POSITION OF THE OTHER
RESULTS OF MY LABORS. '
"In this instance, your essence was obeying this divine commandment
when, personally experiencing bliss, and at the same moment remembering
by association that others were deprived of it, you sobbed sincerely with your
whole presence.
"I am all the more glad for you because these data, indispensable for every
being, are beginning to function in you just at the time when all those factors
are being crystallized and formed in you which do not depend upon a being's
own Reason but solely upon surrounding beings, external conditions, and the
most great common-cosmic Iraniranumange.
"Well then, we can now return to my intended theme, that is, why, during the
whole of our voyage on this trans-space ship, I have told you so much and in
this particular sequence about the three-brained beings breeding on the planet
Earth.
"When I returned to our dear Karatas, and was free from any other being
duties, I voluntarily took upon myself the responsible guidance of your
'oskiano' or, as your favorites would say, your 'education for the being of a
responsible being. ' And as the given period of your existence was just the
period when all those functions are harmonized which engender in three
brained beings that form of feeling and comprehension which in its totality
actualizes in them what is called 'sane mentation,' I decided, on setting out on
this journey in the space ship Karnak, to take advantage of this time to help
you in such a way that the harmonizing of these functions of yours, and the
consecutive formation of your future active mentation dependent on them,
would proceed precisely in that order, the correctness of which I became
convinced of with my



whole presence during the process of my long personal existence.
"When I noticed at the beginning of our voyage that you were greatly
interested in the three-brained beings of the planet Earth, I decided, under the
pretext of gratifying your interest, to tell you everything about them in such a
way that the 'egoplastikoori' required for your future being-associations
would be crystallized in you without any admixture of doubt.
"For this, in almost all my tales, I have held strictly to the two following principles. "The first not to say anything as if it were my own personal opinion, in
order that data necessary for your own convictions should not be crystallized
in you in a ready-made form, according to the opinions of another.
"And second to relate to you, in a definite order and intentional sequence,
all the events on that planet Earth connected with the arising and gradual
increase among your favorites of the various inner and outer abnormalities in
the process of their ordinary being-existence, which as a whole have brought
them to their present desolate and almost inescapable condition, in order that
you should be able to marshal your own subjective reasoning concerning all
the causes of these events, solely on the basis of certain facts that I would tell
you.
"I decided to do this so that many differently essenced egoplastikoori
should be crystallized in corresponding localizations of your common
presence for the needs of your future logical confrontation, and also that,
through active mentation, there should proceed more intensively in you the
proper elaboration of the sacred substances 'abrustdonis' and 'helkdonis,'
required for coating and perfecting both your higher being-parts.
"And now, my boy, so that what I am saying at this moment should be still
more comprehensible to you, I find



it necessary to repeat, in another and more definite form, what I have already
mentioned many times concerning the difference between what are called
'knowledge' and 'understanding' in three-brained beings.
"In order that this difference should stand out more clearly, I shall again
take as an example the ordinary Reason of your favorites.
"If one compares what they call their 'conscious Reason,' which is
completely fixed in contemporary beings there, with the Reason of three
brained beings who breed on other planets of our Great Megalocosmos, then
the former might be called the 'Reason of knowing' and the latter the 'Reason
of understanding.
"The conscious 'Reason of understanding,' proper to three-brained beings
in general, and which terrestrial beings of past epochs possessed, is
'something' that blends with their common presence, and therefore every kind
of information perceived with this Reason becomes forever an inseparable
part of themselves.
"All the information perceived with this Reason, and all the results
obtained through being-contemplation of the totality of information formerly
perceived by this same Reason, however much a being himself may change
and whatever changes may take place in his surroundings, will be forever a
part of his essence.
"As for that Reason which has become habitual for most of your
contemporary favorites, and which I called the 'Reason of knowing,' every
kind of new impression perceived through that Reason, and likewise every
kind of intentional or simply automatic result of former impressions, is only a
temporary part of the being and can appear in him only in certain
circumstances and on condition that the information it is based on should
without fail be so to say 'refreshed' or 'repeated' from time to time—otherwise
these impressions change by themselves, or even entirely so to say 'evaporate'



from the common presence of these three-brained beings. "Although with respect to the sacred Triamazikamno the process of the
formation of these two kinds of being-Reason occurs in the same way, the
factors determining the actualization of its three independent holy forces are
different.
"In the formation of the 'Reason of knowing,' the affirming and denying
factors are the formerly perceived, contradictory impressions, crystallized in
any one of a being's three localizations, and only the new impressions
received from outside serve, in this case, as the third factor.
"And in the 'Reason of understanding,' the first factor, that is, the Holy
Affirming, consists of the newly perceived impressions in whatever
localization is, at the given moment, the 'center of gravity of functioning', the
second, or Holy Denying, consists of the corresponding data already present
in another of the localizations, and the third factor consists of what are known
as the 'being-autokolitzikners' or, as they are otherwise called,
'hoodatzbabognari,' which is a word that means 'the results of perseveringly
actualizing the striving to manifest one's own individuality. '
"By the way, you might as well hear once more, even if you already know
it, that the 'being-autokolitzikners' are formed in all three localizations in the
presence of three-brained beings only from the results of the actualization of
'being-partkdolgduty,' that is to say, thanks to those factors which, from the
very first arising of three-brained beings, were destined by our Uni-Being
Common Father to be the means for self-perfecting.
"It is these 'autokolitzikners' in the common presence of three-brained
beings, serving as the 'third holy force' of the sacred Triamazikamno, which
actualize the arising of the 'Reason of understanding.
"It is only thanks to this 'third force' in the process of the blending of newly
perceived impressions of every kind that there are crystallized in a being, on
the basis of the sacred



Triamazikamno, data for the cognizance and understanding proper to that
being alone, and it is only during these processes of the crystallization of data
for consciousness in the presence of three-brained beings that what is called
'zernofookalnian friction' takes place, which gives rise in them to the
formation of the sacred substances 'abrustdonis' and 'helkdonis,' required for
the coating and perfecting of their higher parts.
"I must tell you here that only these newly perceived impressions which
are crystallized in this order and which appear in beings as a result of
conscious mentation are deposited in the localizations of beings with the
series of data corresponding to former similar impressions already fixed in
them.
"On the other hand, new impressions crystallized in the other order, that is,
through the 'Reason of knowing,' settle in the being-localizations at random,
quite without any kind of so to say 'classification ' And all these new
impressions settle into the series of those former impressions which almost
always have nothing in common with them.
"It is chiefly for this reason that, in the presence of three-brained beings
who have only the 'Reason of knowing,' everything newly learned is
deposited and remains forever simply as information, without any cognizance
of it by the whole of their being.
"Thus new data of all kinds, perceived and fixed in this way in beings
having the 'Reason of knowing,' have no value or usefulness for the welfare of
their own subsequent existence Moreover, the length of time it takes for fixed
impressions of this kind to decrystallize depends on the quantity and the
quality of the impulses engendered in a given being.
"As regards this latter fact ensuing from the degenerated functioning of the Reason of your contemporary favorites, I recall by association one very rarely used saying of our



respected teacher Mullah Nasr Eddin, which is expressed in the following words: 'As soon as anything is needed, it seems that it is filthy and eaten by
mice.'
"All of what your favorites call 'knowledge,' which has been acquired in
their common presence in this way, is subjective, and has absolutely nothing
in common with Objective Knowledge.
"Well then, my boy, in order that the mentioned 'zernofookalnian friction'
should be aroused in your being, and the crystallization of new perceptions
should proceed for the 'Reason of understanding,' I, already knowing very
well what are called the 'laws of the fixing and unfixing of ideas in the
localizations of beings'—the details of which, by the way, I learned thanks to
your favorites during my sojourn among them as a 'professional hypnotist'
had in view in recounting my tales, among many other principles regarding
the correct perception of new information through outside guidance, always to
adhere to one inflexible rule, so that the gradual broadening of what is called
the 'quintessence of the information' should proceed in you in the entire
absence of the being-impulses of 'indignation,' 'offense,' 'vexation,' and so
forth.
"Regarding the sequence in which I gave you my information and its
effects on your essence-understanding, I must tell you that if, from the
moment I first noticed your interest in the three-brained beings arising on the
planet Earth, I had given you only my personal convictions about each of the
events, and the opinions fixed in me about them in the course of my
observations, and not given until afterward the abundant and many-sided
'totality of information,' then all these facts would have been taken in by you
without your own being-logical confrontation, and the data thus crystallized
would have settled in your corresponding localiza



tions simply as information, without any genuine being-understanding. "That is why I recounted my tales about the three-brained beings who
breed on the planet Earth in such a way that there should be crystallized in the
corresponding localizations of your common presence many different kinds of
data for your future being-associations concerning all the totalities or
branches of Objective Knowledge, and that the process of 'zernofookalnian
friction' should take place intensively in your common presence, to bring
about the result I have just witnessed in the way you answered my question,
'Why are you weeping?'
"So, my boy, now that I have become more or less convinced that the time I
have spent was not in vain, and that my tales about your terrestrial favorites
have brought you the benefit I expected, I think we might stop talking about
them so as not to evoke the process of active mentation in you any longer,
besides, there is little time left, for we shall soon be on our dear Karatas.
"Nevertheless, I must now give you a strict command, which I will briefly
explain you must try with all the Reason you have in your presence to make
sure that certain of the functions proceeding in you, and which in general give
three-brained beings the possibility of active mentation, should remain
inactive or, as is said, should 'rest', and this you should do for a time equal to
the duration of our journey, that is, for as long as we have spoken about the
three-brained beings of the planet Earth During this time, those functions
should rest which have participated more intensively than usual in your active
mentation and which, moreover, do not depend for their functioning on the
essence of beings, but exclusively on what is called the 'harmony of the
common-cosmic tempo.'



"In this connection, by the way, you should always remember that the
Reason of any being, and the intensity of action of this Reason, depend on the
correct functioning of all the separate parts of his whole presence.
"For instance, all the functionings of the 'planetary body' and the planetary
body itself constitute the largest part of a being, but the separate functionings
as well as the whole of this body, without the other spiritualized parts of the
being, are only a dependent cosmic formation, conscious of nothing,
therefore, on the basis of what you once called the 'common universal pillar
of Justice,' each spiritualized part of a being must always be just toward the
dependent and unconscious part and not require of it more than it is able to
give.
"As it is for everything in the Megalocosmos, so it is for the planetary
body of a being, in order that it may correctly serve its principal part, that is to
say, for this auxiliary part of the whole being to properly serve the essence
itself, the essence must always be just and only make demands on it within
the limits of its possibilities.
"Apart from the question of justice, it is necessary for a being to act toward
his unconscious part in such a way as to allow certain functions to remain
inactive from time to time, so that it may always be possible for this
unconscious part, gradually and in its own time, to blend its newly acquired
subjective tempos with the objective tempos of our common Megalocosmos.
"One should take note that in the Megalocosmos the blending of tempos
proceeds only 'katznookitzkernally' or, as your favorites would say, 'with law
conformable gradualness.'
"And so, if you wish your active mentation to proceed correctly and
productively during your future responsible existence, you must now, if this
kind of mentation has already begun in you and if this inner process has
undesirable



consequences for your planetary body, cease occupying yourself with it for a
while, however much you may like it and however greatly you may be
interested in it, otherwise 'dezonakooasanz' will occur in you, that is to say,
only one part of your presence will acquire a new tempo, and so you will
become, as your favorites would say, 'lopsided.'
"By the way, most of your favorites, particularly the contemporary ones,
when they reach responsible age become precisely such 'lopsided' beings .
"In short, only by a gradual change of the tempo of one part of the whole
is it possible to change the tempo of the whole itself without injuring it.
"And now I find it necessary to repeat that active mentation in a being,
and the useful results of this mentation, are in reality actualized exclusively
by the functioning to an equal degree of all three of the localizations of
spiritualized results in his presence, called the 'thinking center,' the 'feeling
center,' and the 'moving center. '



CHAPTER 47
The inevitable result of impartial mentation
BEELZEBUB would have said more, but just then everything was suddenly lit
up and permeated by a "pale blue something " From that moment the speed of
falling of the ship Karnak began to decrease perceptibly.
This meant that in this sphere of the Universe one of the great cosmic
"egolionopties" had appeared and was about to come alongside the space ship
Karnak.
And indeed, through the transparent outer walls of the Karnak the source of
that "pale blue something" soon became visible, lighting up not only the
whole interior of the ship but also all the space of the Universe around this
great cosmic "egolionopty," as far as the ordinary vision of beings could reach
In the whole Universe there are only four of these great "egolionopties,"
and each of them is under the direction of one of the four All-Quarters
Maintainers of the Universe.
A hurried and somewhat anxious commotion spread among the beings
aboard the Karnak, and in a short time all the passengers and crew assembled
in the main hall in the center of the ship.
Each of them bore a branch of myrtle in one hand and a "dezjelkasheh" in the other. When the great cosmic egolionopty had come alongside, certain partitions
of the ship Karnak were moved apart in a special way and there passed from
the egolionopty into the main hall of the ship a procession composed of
several archangels with a multitude of angels, cherubim, and seraphim, and
they too carried branches in their hands, but theirs were of palm.



At the head of this procession walked a venerable archangel, immediately followed by two cherubim solemnly bearing a casket from which radiated "something orange. " In front of everyone, in the main hall of the ship Karnak, stood Beelzebub, and behind him were ranged his kinsmen and the captain of the ship, and behind them stood all the others at a respectful distance. When the procession from the egolionopty drew near the beings of Beelzebub's nature who were assembled in expectation, it halted, and the two groups of three-brained beings of different natures joined in singing the Hymn to our Endlessness that is always sung on such occasions everywhere in the Universe by beings of all natures and all forms of exterior coating.
This hymn has the following words:
Thou Long-Patient Creator of all that breathes, Thou Abundantly Loving Cause of all that exists, Thou Unique Vanquisher of the merciless Heropass, Now to the sound of our exaltation, Rejoice and abide in beatitude By Thy unprecedented labors Thou hast given us the source of our arising, By Thy vanquishing of the Heropass Thou hast opened to us the possibility Of perfecting ourselves to the sacred Anklad And now only rest, as Thou hast merited We in gratitude Will maintain all Thou hast created, And always and in everything will extol Thee forever, Extol Thee, Maker-CreatorThou, the Beginning of all ends, Thou, proceeding from Infinity, Thou Who hast the end of all things within Thyself, Thou, our Endless Endlessness



After the hymn had been sung, the venerable archangel who was at the head of the procession approached Beelzebub and solemnly proclaimed: "By the decree of His All-Quarters Maintainer, the Arch-Cherub Peshtvogner, and bearing his own sacred rod, we appear before you, Your Right Reverence, in order to restore to you, in accordance with the pardon granted you from Above and for certain of your merits, that which you lost during your exile—your horns. Having said this, the venerable archangel turned toward the casket borne by the cherubim and with profound reverence carefully took from it the sacred rod. Meanwhile all those present knelt down on one knee, while the angels and
cherubim began to sing the appropriate sacred canticles.
With the sacred rod in his hand, the archangel turned again toward Beelzebub and spoke thus to the beings of Beelzebub's nature. "Beings created by our Uni-Being Endlessness, Who by His infinite grace has pardoned this once-erring being Beelzebub, who will again exist among you, beings like himself. "As the virility and degree of Reason of beings of your nature are defined
and manifested by the horns on your heads, we must, with the permission of
our All-Quarters Maintainer, and with your help, restore the horns lost by
Beelzebub.
"Beings created by our One Common Father, your help will consist in this,
that each of you should consent to renounce, on behalf of Beelzebub's merited
pardon, certain particles of your own horns.
"Therefore whosoever consents and wishes to do so, let him approach the sacred rod and touch its handle On the length of time the handle of this sacred rod is held will depend the quantity of active elements passing from your



own horns for forming corresponding horns on this pardoned being of your nature. Having said this, the venerable archangel, holding the chief end of the
sacred rod, that is, the ball, over the kneeling Beelzebub, turned the handle
toward those there assembled so that whoever wished might come and touch
it.
As soon as the venerable archangel had finished speaking, a very great
commotion began among the beings of Beelzebub's nature, each one desiring
to come nearer and be the first to hold the sacred rod for as long as possible.
Order was soon established, however, and each one approached in turn and
held the handle for as long as was indicated by the captain of the ship, who
had taken upon himself the direction of the ceremony.
During this solemn sacred action, horns began to grow, little by little, upon
the head of Beelzebub.
At first, while just the bare horns were taking shape, only a grave and
concentrated quiet prevailed among those assembled But from the moment
that forks began to appear upon the horns, a tense interest and rapt attention
was manifested among them And this was because everybody was stirred by
the wish to learn how many forks would make their appearance on Beelzebub,
since their number would indicate, in keeping with the Sacred Measurer of
Objective Reason, the gradation to which Beelzebub had attained.
First one fork was formed, then another, and then a third, and as each fork
made its appearance, a clearly perceptible thrill of joy and profound
satisfaction was evoked in all those present.
When a fourth fork began to appear on the horns, the tension among those
assembled reached its height, since the formation of a fourth fork signified
that the Reason of Beelzebub had already been perfected up to the sacred
"Ternoonald," and hence there remained for Beelzebub only two gradations
before attaining to the sacred Anklad.



As this unusual ceremony was nearing its end, and before all the
participants had time to recover their self-possession after their earlier joyful
agitation, suddenly on Beelzebub's horns there appeared of itself a fifth fork of
a special form known to them all.
Thereupon all without exception, even the venerable archangel himself, fell
prostrate before Beelzebub, who had risen to his feet and stood transfigured in
the grandeur conferred on him by the truly majestic horns which had arisen on
his head.
And all fell prostrate before Beelzebub because the fifth fork on his horns
indicated that he had attained the Reason of the sacred "Podkoolad," which is
the last gradation of Reason before the sacred Anklad.
The Reason of the sacred Anklad is the highest to which, in general, any
being can attain, it is the third in degree from the Absolute Reason of His
Endlessness Himself.
But the Reason of the sacred Podkoolad, to which Beelzebub had perfected
himself, is also very rare in the Universe Hence even the venerable archangel
prostrated himself before Beelzebub, for the degree of his own Reason was as
yet only that of the sacred "Degindad," that is, three degrees below that of the
Reason of the sacred Anklad.
When they had all risen to their feet, the venerable archangel, this time
addressing all the assembled beings of different natures, proclaimed:
"Beings created by One Creator, we have just been worthy to be the first to
behold the fulfillment of that which is the dream of all those present, as it is of
all beings in the whole of our Great Megalocosmos.
"And now let us rejoice together and sing in exaltation over this privilege,
which is a revivifying shock for our power to struggle against our own
denying source, which power alone can lead us to that sacred Podkoolad
attained by this son of our Common Father who, although he first



transgressed on account of his youth, was afterward able, by his conscious labor and intentional suffering, to become worthy in his essence to be one of the very rare sacred Podkoolads of the whole of our Great Universe. " After this exhortation by the archangel, all the beings present on the space ship Karnak began to sing the prescribed sacred canticle entitled "I Rejoice. " And when this sacred canticle had been sung, all the angels and cherubim, with the venerable archangel at their head, returned to the cosmic egolionopty, which then drew away from the ship Karnak and gradually disappeared into space, whereupon the passengers and crew dispersed to their various places and the Karnak resumed its falling toward its destination.
After this most great universal solemnity, Beelzebub, with his grandson and his old servant Ahoon, who like all the other passengers of the space ship Karnak were deeply moved by this unexpected event, returned to that part of the ship where all their talks had taken place about the men-beings arising and existing on the Earth. When Beelzebub, now with a transfigured appearance corresponding to his merits, had taken his usual place, Ahoon, his old servant who had been close to him for almost the whole of his existence, suddenly fell prostrate before him and in a sincerely entreating voice, began to speak: "Sacred Podkoolad of our Great Megalocosmos! Have mercy upon me and
pardon me, unfortunate ordinary three-centered being that I am, for all my
past disrespectful manifestations, voluntary and involuntary, toward your
Sacred Essence.
"Have mercy and pardon me, pardon just this three-centered being who, though he has existed a very long time, yet to his misfortune—only because in his preparatory age none of his elders aided the crystallization in him of the



psychic factors for the power to intensively actualize being-partkdolgduty
indispensable to every three-brained being— had until now been so blind that
he was unable even instinctively to sense that Uni-Being and unshakable
reality beneath an exterior coated in conformity with the common-cosmic
Trogoautoegocrat and surrounding conditions—a reality sacred for every
breathing creature, which bears the name of 'Objective Reason. ' "
Having said this, Ahoon stood as if sunk in a stupor, silently expectant
And Beelzebub, also in silence, gazed at him with a look that was visibly
full of love and forgiveness, yet in which there could also be felt his essence
grief and his resignation to the inevitable.
During this scene, Hassein stood apart in the posture known everywhere as
the "posture of the famous universal hermit, Harnatoolkpararana of the planet
Kirmankshana. "
And a little later, when Beelzebub glanced around and noticed his
grandson in this posture, he turned to him and said:
"What, my boy! Can it be that the same thing is proceeding in your presence as in our old Ahoon's?" To this question of Beelzebub, Hassein, in an uncertain tone unusual for him, replied timidly: "Yes . . . almost . . . Sacred Podkoolad of our Great Megalocosmos Only
with this difference, that at this moment the impulse of love both for our
Ahoon and for the three-brained beings of the planet Earth is functioning still
more strongly in me.
"This impulse of love is growing stronger in me because, it seems to me,
both Ahoon and the three-brained beings of the planet Earth have greatly
helped me to become worthy of being an eyewitness of the glorification of
him who is the cause of the cause of my arising and who until now I have
called 'my dear grandfather,' but who has now become,



also for me, one of the sacred Podkoolads of our Great Megalocosmos, before whom all will bow and before whom at this moment I have the happiness to stand. " "Ekh, ekh, ekh!" exclaimed Beelzebub, and giving his features the expression he was wont to assume during his sojourns on the planet Earth, he said: "First of all, I wish to voice in the language of our venerable Mullah Nasr
Eddin the thought that arises in me by association about Ahoon's words, so
unusual for him, and also about his unaccustomed posture.
"Our dear teacher would say in such a case: 'Don't shed tears in vain like
the poor crocodile that snapped at the fisherman and missed biting off his
lower left half.'
"And now take your usual places and let us talk a little more.
"Although we are now entering the atmosphere of our planet Karatas, we
shall not land for a fairly long time because, as is usual with space ships, our
ship has to exhaust its acquired momentum before it stops at its destined
mooring place. "
Hassein and Ahoon immediately and wordlessly proceeded to follow
Beelzebub's suggestion, though by their movements and the transparency of
their inner psyche, it was evident that there had been a marked change in their
attitude toward the person of Beelzebub since that all-universal event.
When they sat down in their usual places, but not this time with the
unconstraint they had formerly shown, Beelzebub turned to Hassein and said:
"First of all, my boy, I give you my word that when we get home—unless some event due to external causes independent of our essence prevents it—I will explain to you everything relating to your favorites that I promised to, but for some reason or other during this voyage of ours on the ship Karnak I have left unexplained.



"Meanwhile, if you have a particular question that needs explanation now, ask it. "But I warn you that we have not enough time for me to reply in the form customary to our talks during this time, so try to formulate your question in such a way that my answer may also be brief. "By such a question you can even show me once more to what extent your logical mentation has developed during my tales about the strange psyche of the three-centered beings arising and existing on the planet Earth. At this proposal of his grandfather, Hassein thought deeply for rather a long time, and then, in a somewhat exalted mood, spoke as follows: "Sacred Podkoolad and fundamental cause of the cause of my arising! "After the solemnity which has just taken place—when your sacred essence was coated with a corresponding visible exterior and when thereby its full significance, which until then could not be perceived or understood by every three-brained being, became clear and perceptible to me, as well as to every other cosmic unit except yourself—every word spoken by you and every counsel of yours has for me the force of law. "I must therefore strive with the whole of my presence to carry out the
suggestion you have just made to me and try to formulate my question as well
and as briefly as possible.
"Sacred Podkoolad, and cause of the cause of my arising! "In order that the convictions formed in me during this time, thanks to your explanations of the abnormalities proceeding on the Earth, may become definitively crystallized in me, I still wish very much to have your personal and sincere opinion about the following.
"How would you reply if our All-Embracing Creator



Endlessness Himself were to summon you before Him and ask you this:
" 'Beelzebub' " 'You, who are one of the hoped-for, accelerated results of all My
actualizations, manifest briefly the conclusions of your impartial observations
and studies over long centuries of the psyche of the three-centered beings
arising on the planet Earth, and say whether it is still possible by any means to
save them and to direct them into the becoming path. ' "
Having said this, Hassein rose and, standing in a posture of reverence,
looked expectantly at Beelzebub.
Ahoon also rose. Beelzebub, smiling lovingly at this question of Hassein, first said that he
was now quite convinced that his tales had brought his grandson the results he
had wished for, then, in a serious tone, he went on to say that if our All
Embracing Uni-Being Creator should indeed summon him and ask him such a
question, he would answer . . .
Suddenly Beelzebub himself arose and, stretching his right arm forward
and his left arm back, directed his gaze somewhere far off, and it seemed as
though he were piercing the very depths of space.
Simultaneously, "something pale yellow" little by little appeared around
Beelzebub, and began to envelop him, and it was in no way possible to
understand or to discern its origin—whether it emanated from Beelzebub
himself or was coming to him through space from sources outside of him.
In the midst of this cosmic actualization, incomprehensible to all three
brained beings, Beelzebub, in a loud voice not usual for him, proclaimed in
penetrating tones:
"Thou All and the Allness of my Wholeness! "The sole means now of saving the beings of the planet Earth would be to
implant in their presence a new organ, an organ like kundabuffer, but this
time having such prop



erties that every one of these unfortunates, during the process of his existence,
should constantly sense and be aware of the inevitability of his own death, as
well as of the death of everyone upon whom his eyes, or attention, rest.
"Only such a sensation and such an awareness could destroy the egoism
now so completely crystallized in them that it has swallowed up the whole of
their essence, and at the same time uproot that tendency to hate others which
flows from it—the tendency that engenders those mutual relationships which
are the chief cause of all their abnormalities, unbecoming to three-brained
beings and maleficent for them and for the whole of the Universe. "



CHAPTER 48
From the author
AFTER six years of work, merciless toward myself and with almost continuous
tense mentation, yesterday I at last finished putting down on paper in a form, I
think, accessible to everybody the first of the three series of books I intended
to write, and in which I had decided to develop a whole body of ideas, which
would permit me to accomplish, first in theory and then in practice, by means
I had previously thought out, three essential tasks I had set myself by means
of the first series, to destroy in people everything that in their false
representations appears to exist in reality or, in other words, to sweep away
without mercy "all the rubbish accumulated in human mentation over the
ages", by means of the second series, to prepare "new constructional
material", and by means of the third, "to build a new world."
Having now finished the first series of books, and following the practice,
established on Earth long ago, of never concluding any such "great
undertaking" without what some call an "epilogue," others an "afterword,"
still others "from the author," and so on, I also now propose to write
something of the kind.
With this in view, I read over very attentively this morning the "preface" I
wrote six years ago, entitled "The Arousing of Thought," in order to take
suitable ideas from it for what might be called a corresponding "logical
fusion" of that beginning with this conclusion I am now about to write.
While reading that first chapter, which I wrote only six years ago, but
which gave me the sensation of having been written long, long ago—a
sensation that is now in my common presence undoubtedly because during
those years I had



to think intensely, and even, as might be said, to "experience" all the material
required for eight thick volumes, as not for nothing is it stated in that branch
of genuine science called the "laws of association of human mentation," which
has come down from very ancient times and is known to only a few
contemporary people, that "the sensation of the flow of time is directly
proportional to the quality and quantity of the flow of thoughts"—well then,
while I was reading that first chapter, which, as I said, I had thought about
deeply from every aspect and "experienced" almost exclusively under the
action of my voluntary self-mortification, and which, moreover, I had written
at a time when the functioning of my entire whole—a functioning that
engenders in a man what is called the "power to manifest himself by his own
initiative"—was utterly disharmonized, that is, when I was still extremely ill
from the effects of an accident that had occurred to me not long before,
consisting in a "charge and crash" of my automobile at full speed into a tree
standing silently, like an observer and reckoner of the disorderly passage of
centuries, on the historic road between the world capital of Paris and the town
of Fontainebleau—a "charge" which, according to any sane human
understanding, should have put an end to my life—well then, from reading
that chapter there arose in me a quite definite decision.
Recalling my state during the writing of that first chapter, I cannot help
adding here—owing to a small weakness of mine that always causes me to
experience an inner satisfaction whenever I see on the faces of our estimable
contemporary "representatives of exact science" that very specific smile,
peculiar to them alone—that although, after this accident, my body was so
battered and "everything in it so disordered" that for months it presented a
general picture which might be described as "a piece of live meat in a clean
bed," my correctly disciplined "spirit," as it would usually be called, despite
the physical state of my body, was not in



the least depressed, as it should have been according to their notions On the contrary, its power was even increased by the intense excitation that had been aroused in it just before the accident by my repeated disappointment in people, particularly in those who devote themselves to what they call "science," and by the disillusion caused me by that ideal which had gradually been formed in my common presence thanks chiefly to a commandment inculcated in me in my childhood, which affirms that "the highest aim and sense of human life is the striving for the welfare of one's neighbor," and that this is attainable only through the conscious renunciation of one's own. And so, after I had attentively read over that opening chapter of the first series, written in the conditions just described, and had recalled by association the texts of the many succeeding chapters which, according to my conviction, are bound to produce in the consciousness of the readers non-habitual impressions that always, as is said, "engender substantial results," "I"—or rather that "something" dominant in my common presence that now represents the sum of the results issuing from the data crystallized during my life, data which, among other things, engender in a man who has set himself the aim of "mentating actively and impartially" during his responsible existence the ability to penetrate and understand the psyche of people of various types—I decided, in concluding this first series of my writings, and urged by the impulse called "love of kind" that arose in me at that moment, to limit myself to appending the first of a considerable number of my lectures that were read publicly during the existence of the establishment I had founded under the name of the "Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man. " That Institute, by the way, no longer exists, and I find it both necessary and opportune, chiefly in order to pacify certain types in various corners of the world, to declare



categorically, here and now, that I have liquidated it completely and forever.
It was with an impulse of inexpressible grief and despondency that I was
constrained to make the decision to liquidate this Institute, and also
everything organized and carefully prepared for the opening, the following
year, of eighteen branches in different countries—in short, to abandon every
thing I had previously created with almost superhuman labor—chiefly
because, about three months after the aforementioned accident, when the
functioning of my usual mentation had been more or less reestablished,
although my body was still quite powerless, I realized that the attempt to pre
serve the existence of this Institute, in the absence of real people around me
and the impossibility of procuring, without my help, the enormous material
means required, would inevitably lead to a catastrophe that would result for
me, in my old age, as well as for many others wholly dependent on me, in a
condition of half-starved "vegetation. "
The lecture I propose to add as a conclusion to this first series was read
more than once during the existence of the Institute by my "pupils of the first
rank," as they were then called Certain of them, by the way, as it later turned
out to my sincere regret, showed a predisposition in their essence to the swift
transformation of their psyche into the psyche called "hasnamussian"—a
predisposition that soon became evident and clearly discernible to all more or
less normal persons around them when, at the moment of inevitable crisis
due to my accident—in everything I had thus far accomplished, they, "fearing
for their skins," that is, fearing to lose their personal welfare, which by the
way I had created for them, deserted the common work and, with their tails
between their legs, took themselves off to their kennels where, profiting by
the crumbs fallen from my so to say "idea table," they opened what I would
call their "schachermacher workshop booths" and, with a secret feeling of



hope and perhaps even of joy at their speedy and complete release from my
vigilant control, began manufacturing out of various unfortunate, naive people
"candidates for lunatic asylums."
I have chosen this particular lecture because when I first began to spread
the ideas I wished to introduce into the life of people, it was specially
composed here in Europe to serve as the introduction or, as it were,
"threshold" to the complete series of lectures, the totality of which alone can
make clear in a form accessible to everybody the necessity, and even the
unavoidable obligation, of putting into practice the immutable truths I have
elucidated and established in half a century of active work, day and night, and
also to prove that it is actually possible to employ these truths for the welfare
of people And furthermore I chose this lecture because, happening to be
present at the large gathering where it was last read publicly, I made an
addition to it which fully corresponds to the hidden thought introduced by Mr
Beelzebub himself into his so to say "concluding chord," an addition which,
by illuminating once more that supreme objective truth, will in my opinion
enable the reader to perceive and assimilate it as befits a being who claims to
be made in the "image of God. "
LECTURE I
The Diversity, According to Law, of the Manifestations of Human Individuality
LAST READ AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYHOUSE IN NEW YORK JANUARY 1924
The investigations of many scientists of past ages, and also the data
obtained at the present time by means of the quite exceptionally conducted
research of the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man according
to the system of



G. I. Gurdjieff, have shown that the whole individuality of every man
according to higher laws and the conditions of the process of human life,
established from the very beginning and gradually fixed on Earth—of
whatever heredity he is the result, and in whatever accidental conditions he
arose and developed, must from the beginning of his responsible life, in order
to respond to the sense and predestination of his existence as a man and not
merely as an animal, indispensably consist of four definite and distinct
personalities.
The first of these four independent personalities is nothing other than the
totality of the automatic functioning proper to man, as to all animals, the data
for which are composed, on the one hand, of the sum total of the results of
impressions perceived since birth from all the surrounding reality, as well as
from everything intentionally implanted in him from outside and, on the other
hand, of the result of the process, also inherent in every animal, called
"daydreaming " And this totality of automatic functioning most people
ignorantly call "consciousness" or, at best, "thinking. "
The second of the four personalities, functioning in most cases entirely
independently of the first, is the sum of the results of data deposited and fixed
in the common presence of every man, as of every animal, through the six
organs called "receivers of vibrations of different qualities"—organs that
function in accordance with the new impressions perceived, and whose
sensitivity depends upon heredity and upon the conditions of the preparatory
formation for responsible existence of the given individual.
The third independent part of the whole being is the basic functioning of
his organism as well as the play of the motor-reflex manifestations acting
upon each other within that functioning—manifestations whose quality
likewise depends on heredity and the circumstances prevailing during his
preparatory formation.



And the fourth personality, which should also be a distinct part of the
whole individual, is none other than the manifestation of the totality of the
results of the already automatized functioning of the three enumerated
personalities separately formed and independently educated in him, that is to
say, it is that part of a being which is called "I. "
In the common presence of a man, for the spiritualization and
manifestation of each of the three separately formed parts of his entire whole
there is an independent "center-of-gravity localization," as it is called, that is
to say, a "brain", and each of these localizations, with its own complete
system, has for the totality of its manifestations its own peculiarities and
predispositions proper to it alone Consequently, in order to make possible the
all-round perfecting of a man, a corresponding, correct education is
absolutely indispensable for each of these three parts—and not such a
treatment as is given nowadays under the name of "education."
Only then can the "I" that should be in a man be his own "I."
According to the serious experiments and investigations already
mentioned, which were carried on over many years, or even simply according
to the sane and impartial reflection of any contemporary man, the common
presence of every man—particularly of one who for some reason claims to be
not just an ordinary, average man, but one of the "intelligentsia," in the
genuine sense of the word—should consist of all four of these distinct and
quite definite personalities, and each of them should be developed in a
corresponding way so that during his responsible existence the manifestations
of these separate parts will harmonize with one another.
To illustrate more clearly the diversity of origin and nature of the
personalities manifested in the general organization of a man, and also to
underline the difference between the "I" that should be in the common
presence of a "man without quotation marks," that is, a real man, and the "pseudo I"



that people today mistake for it, one can very well make use of an analogy
which, though worn threadbare by "spiritualists," "occultists," "theosophists,"
and other contemporary specialists in "catching fish in muddy waters," with
their prattle about the "astral body," the "mental body," and other such bodies
that are supposed to exist in man, can nevertheless throw light on the question
we are now considering.
A man as a whole, with all his distinct and separately functioning
localizations, that is to say, his independently formed and educated
"personalities," is almost exactly comparable to that equipage for transporting
a passenger which consists of a carriage, a horse, and a coachman.
It must be remarked, to begin with, that the difference between a real man
and a pseudo man, that is, between a man who has his own "I" and one who
has not, is indicated in this analogy by the passenger sitting in the carriage In
the first case, that of the real man, the passenger is the owner of the carriage,
and in the second case, he is merely the first chance passer-by who, like the
fare in a "hackney carriage," is continually changing.
The body of a man, with all its motor-reflex manifestations, corresponds
simply to the carriage itself, all the functionings and manifestations of feeling
of a man correspond to the horse harnessed to the carriage and drawing it, the
coachman sitting on the box and directing the horse corresponds to what in a
man people usually call "consciousness" or "thought", and finally, the
passenger sitting in the carriage and giving orders to the coachman is what is
called "I ."
The fundamental evil among contemporary people is that, owing to the
rooted and widespread abnormal methods of education of the rising
generation, this fourth personality, which should be present in everybody on
reaching responsible age, is entirely lacking in them, and almost all of them



consist only of three of the enumerated parts, which, moreover, are formed
arbitrarily of themselves and anyhow In other words, almost every
contemporary man of responsible age consists of neither more nor less than a
"hackney carriage," and what is more, a broken-down carriage that has long
ago seen its day, a crock of a horse, and on the box, a tatterdemalion, half
asleep, half-drunk coachman, whose time designated by Mother Nature for
self-perfection passes in fantastic daydreams while he waits on a corner for
any old chance passenger The first one who happens along hires him and
dismisses him just as he pleases, and not only him but also all the parts
subordinate to him.
Pursuing this analogy between a typical contemporary man with his
thoughts, feelings, and body, and a hackney carriage with its horse and
coachman, we can clearly see that in each of the parts composing these two
organizations there must have been formed and must exist its own separate
needs, habits, tastes, and so on, proper to it alone because, according to the
different nature of their origin and the diverse conditions of their formation,
and also the varying possibilities put into them, there must inevitably have
been formed in each of these parts its own psyche, its own notions, its own
subjective supports, its own viewpoints, and so on.
The whole sum of the manifestations of human thought, with all the
inherencies proper to its functioning and with all its specific characteristics,
corresponds in almost every respect to the essence and manifestations of a
typical hired coachman.
Like all hired coachmen in general, he is a certain type called "cabby" He
is not entirely illiterate because, owing to the laws existing in his country for
the "general compulsory teaching" of the three Rs, he was obliged in his
childhood to put in an occasional appearance at what is called the "parish
school."



Although he himself is a country boy and has remained as ignorant as his
fellow rustics, yet rubbing shoulders, thanks to his profession, with people of
various positions and education and picking up from them, a bit here and a bit
there, a lot of expressions for various notions, he has now come to look down
with contempt upon everything smacking of the country, indignantly
dismissing it all as "ignorance."
In short, this is a type to whom one could apply perfectly the adage:
"Too good for the crows, but the peacocks won't have him. " He considers himself competent even in questions of religion, politics, and
sociology, with his equals he likes to argue, those whom he regards as his
inferiors he likes to teach, with his superiors he is a servile flatterer, he stands
before them, as is said, "cap in hand."
One of his greatest weaknesses is dangling after the neighborhood cooks
and housemaids, but best of all he likes to put away a good square meal and
to gulp down another glass or two, and then, fully satiated, drowsily to
daydream.
To gratify these weaknesses of his he regularly steals part of the money
his employer gives him to buy fodder for the horse.
Like every "cabby" he works only "under the lash," and if occasionally he
does a job without being made to, it is always in the hope of a tip.
The desire for tips has gradually taught him to detect certain weaknesses
in the people he deals with and to take advantage of them, he has
automatically learned to be cunning, to flatter, "to stroke people the right
way," as they say, and in general, to lie.
On every convenient occasion when he has a free moment, he slips into a
saloon or a bar where, over a glass of beer, he daydreams for hours at a time,
or talks with a type like himself, or just reads the paper.



He tries to look imposing, wears a beard, and if he is thin, pads himself out to appear more important. As regards the feeling-localization in a man, the totality of its manifestations and the whole system of its functioning correspond perfectly to the horse of the "hackney carriage" in our analogy. Incidentally, this comparison of the horse with the composition of human feeling will help to show particularly clearly the error and one-sidedness of the contemporary education inflicted on the rising generation. The horse, owing to the negligence of those around it during its early years, and to its constant solitude, is as if locked up within itself, in other words, its "inner life" is driven inside and for external manifestations it has nothing but inertia. Thanks to the abnormal conditions around it, the horse has never received
any special education but has been molded solely under the influence of
constant thrashings and vile abuse.
It has always been kept tied up, and for food, instead of oats and hay it has only been given straw, which is utterly worthless for its real needs. Never having seen in any of the manifestations toward it the least love or
friendliness, the horse is now ready to surrender itself completely to anybody
who gives it the slightest caress.
In consequence of all this, the inclinations of the horse, thus deprived of all interests and aspirations, must inevitably concentrate on food, drink, and the automatic yearning for the opposite sex, hence it invariably veers in the direction where it can get any of these and if, for example, it catches sight of a place where even once or twice it gratified one of these needs, it waits for the chance to run off in that direction. It must be added that although the coachman has a very feeble understanding of his duties, he can nevertheless, even



though only a little, think logically, and, remembering tomorrow, he does
occasionally—either from the fear of losing his job or the desire of receiving
a reward—show an interest in doing something or other for his employer
without being forced to. But the horse, in the absence of a special education
adapted to its nature, has not received at the proper time any data at all for
manifesting the aspirations requisite for responsible existence, and of course it
fails to understand— indeed it cannot be expected to understand—why it
should do anything It therefore carries out its obligations with complete
indifference and only from fear of further beatings.
As for the carriage, which in our analogy stands for the body considered
separately from the other independently formed parts of the common presence
of a man, its situation is even worse.
This carriage, like most other carriages, is made out of various materials
and, furthermore, is of a very complicated construction.
It was designed, as is evident to any sane-thinking man, to carry all kinds
of loads, and not for the purpose for which it is used by contemporary people,
that is, only to carry passengers.
The chief cause of the many misunderstandings connected with it springs
from the fact that those who invented the system of this carriage intended it
for travel on byroads, and therefore certain inner details of its general
construction were designed with this in view.
For example, the principle of its greasing, which is one of the chief needs
of an equipage made of such different materials, was so devised that the
grease should spread over all the metal parts from the jolting inevitable on
such roads, whereas now, this carriage, designed for traveling on byroads, is
usually stationed on a rank in the city and travels on smooth, level, paved
streets.
In the absence of any shocks whatsoever while rolling



along such roads, the greasing of all its parts does not take place uniformly, and consequently some of them are bound to rust and cease to perform the functions intended for them. A carriage goes easily, as a rule, if its moving parts are properly greased With too little grease, these parts get overheated and finally red-hot, and thus the other parts get spoiled, however, if there is too much grease on some part, the general functioning of the carriage is impaired, and in either case it becomes more difficult for the horse to pull it. The contemporary coachman, our cabby, has no inkling of the need for greasing the carriage, and even if he does grease it, he does so without proper knowledge, only on hearsay, blindly following the directions of the first comer. So, when this carriage, now more or less adapted for travel on smooth roads, has for some reason or other to go along a byroad, something always happens to it either a nut gives way, or a bolt gets bent, or something or other gets loose, and so these expeditions rarely end without more or less considerable repairs. In any case, it has become more and more risky to use this carriage for its intended purpose And once repairs are begun, you have to take the carriage all to pieces, examine all its parts one by one and, as is always done in such cases, "kerosene" them, clean them, and then put them together again, and frequently it becomes obvious that you have to change a part immediately and without fail This is all very well if the part happens to be inexpensive, but it may turn out that the repair is more costly than a new carriage. And so, all that has been said about the separate parts of that vehicle which, taken as a whole, constitutes a "hackney carriage" is fully applicable to the general organization of the common presence of a man. In view of the lack among contemporary people of any knowledge or ability to prepare the rising generation for responsible existence in an appropriate way, by educating



all the separate parts composing their common presence, every person of
today is a confused and extremely ludicrous "something" which, again using
our analogy, presents the following picture.
A carriage of the latest model, just out of the factory, varnished by genuine
German craftsmen from the town of Barmen, and harnessed to the kind of
horse which in the region of Transcaucasia is called a "dglozidzi " "Dzi" is a
horse, "dgloz" was the name of a certain Armenian expert in the art of buying
and skinning utterly worthless horses.
On the box of this stylish carriage sits an unshaven, unkempt, sleepy
coachman, dressed in a shabby frock coat, which he has retrieved from the
rubbish bin where it had been thrown out as useless by Maggie, the
kitchenmaid On his head reposes a brand-new top hat, an exact replica of
Rockefeller's, and in his buttonhole is displayed a giant chrysanthemum.
Contemporary man inevitably presents such a ludicrous picture, because
from the day of his arising these three parts formed in him—which though of
diverse origin and having properties of diverse quality should nevertheless,
for pursuing a single aim during his responsible existence, represent together
his "entire whole"—begin, so to say, to "live" and to become fixed in their
specific manifestations separately from one another, never having been
trained to give the required automatic reciprocal support and help or to un
derstand one another even approximately Thus later, when there is a need for
concerted manifestations, these concerted manifestations do not appear.
To be sure, thanks to what is called the "system of education of the rising
generation," completely fixed at the present time in the life of man, and which
consists simply and solely in drumming into the pupils, by means of constant
repetition to the point of stupefaction, numerous almost empty words and
expressions, and in training them to rec



ognize merely by the difference in their sounds the reality these words and
expressions are supposed to signify, the coachman is still able to explain after
a fashion the various desires he feels (though only to types like himself), and
he is sometimes even able, at least approximately, to understand others.
This coachman-cabby of ours, gossiping with other coachmen while
waiting for a fare, and sometimes, as is said, "flirting" in the doorways with
the local maids, even picks up various forms of what is called "civility. "
In accordance with the external conditions of the life of coachmen in
general, he also gradually automatizes himself to distinguish one street from
another and, for instance, to calculate how, when a street is closed for repairs,
to get to the required destination from another direction.
But as for the horse, even though the maleficent contemporary invention
called "education" does not extend to its formation, and in consequence its
inherited possibilities are not atrophied, yet because of the fact that it has been
formed under the abnormal conditions of the established process of ordinary
existence, and that it grows up ignored by everybody, like an orphan, and
moreover an ill-treated orphan, it neither acquires anything corresponding to
the psyche of the coachman nor learns anything of what he knows, and hence
it remains ignorant of the forms of reciprocal relationship which have become
habitual for the coachman, and no contact is made between them for
understanding each other.
It may happen, however, that in its locked-in life the horse comes to learn
some form of relationship with the coachman and even, perhaps, is not
unfamiliar with some sort of "language", but the trouble is that the coachman
does not know this or even suspect that such a thing is possible.
Apart from the fact that, in these abnormal conditions, no data have been formed between the horse and the coach



man to allow them to understand each other automatically, even a little, there
are many other outer causes, independent of them, which deprive them of the
possibility of fulfilling together that single purpose for which they were both
destined.
Just as the separate independent parts of a "hackney carnage" are
connected, namely, the carriage to the horse by the shafts and the horse to the
coachman by the reins, so also are the separate parts of the general
organization of a man connected with each other: the body is connected to the
feeling-organization by the blood, and the feeling-organization with that of
the thought or consciousness by what is called "hanbledzoïn," namely, by that
substance which arises in the common presence of a man from all
intentionally made being-efforts.
The deplorable system of education existing at the present time has led to
the coachman's ceasing to have any effect whatever on his horse, at best he
can arouse in its consciousness by means of the reins just three ideas—right,
left, and stop.
Strictly speaking, he cannot always do even this, because the reins are
generally made of materials that react to atmospheric phenomena for
example, in a pouring rain they swell and lengthen, and in heat, the contrary,
thus having a varying effect upon the horse's automatized sensitivity of
perception.
The same thing proceeds in the general organization of the ordinary man
whenever from some impression or other the "density and tempo of the
hanbledzoïn" change in him so that his thinking loses all possibility of
affecting his feeling-organization.
And so, to sum up everything that has been said, we must willy-nilly
acknowledge that every man should strive to have his own "I,” otherwise he
will never represent anything.



more than a "hackney carriage" which any passing fare can sit in and dispose of just as he pleases. Here it will not be superfluous to point out that the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man has among its fundamental tasks the aim, on the one hand, of educating in its pupils each of the independent personalities I spoke of, first separately and then in their reciprocal relationships, according to the needs of their subjective life in the future, and on the other hand, of begetting and fostering in each of its pupils what every bearer of the name of "man without quotation marks" should have—his own "I. "
For a more exact, and so to speak scientific, definition of the difference
between a real man, that is, a man as he ought to be, and a "man in quotation
marks," such as almost all contemporary people have become, it is appropriate
to quote here what was said about this by Gurdjieff himself in one of his
lectures.
What he said was this: "For the definition of man, according to our point of view, no contemporary knowledge, whether anatomical, physiological, or psychological, can help us, since each of the characteristics it describes is inherent to one degree or another in every man and applies equally to all, and consequently this knowledge does not enable us to determine the exact difference between people that we wish to establish. "The measure of this difference can only be formulated in the following
terms:
" 'Man is a being who can do,' and 'to do' means to act consciously and by
one's own initiative.
"And indeed every more or less sane-thinking man, capable of being at all
impartial, must admit that never before has there been, nor could there be, a
fuller or more exhaustive definition.



"Suppose that we provisionally accept this definition, the question
inevitably arises can a man who is a product of contemporary education and
civilization do anything at all himself, consciously and by his own will?
"No . . . we answer at once to this question "And why not? . . . "Simply because, as the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man
categorically affirms and demonstrates on the basis of its experiments,
everything without exception, from beginning to end, 'does itself in
contemporary man, and there is nothing that a contemporary man himself does.
"In personal, family, and social life, in politics, science, art, philosophy,
and religion, in short, in everything entering into the process of the ordinary
life of a contemporary man, everything from beginning to end does itself, and
not a single one of these 'victims of contemporary civilization' can 'do'
anything.
"This experimentally proved, categorical affirmation of the Institute for the
Harmonious Development of Man, namely, that the ordinary man can 'do'
nothing and that everything does itself in him, coincides with what is said of
man by contemporary 'exact positive science.'
"Contemporary 'exact positive science' says that a man is a very complex
organism developed by evolution from the simplest organisms, and now
capable of reacting in a very complex manner to external impressions.
"This capacity for reaction in man is so complex, and the reflex
movements can be so far removed from the causes evoking and conditioning
them, that to naive observation the actions of man, or at least some of them,
seem quite spontaneous.
According to the ideas of Gurdjieff, the ordinary man is really incapable of the slightest independent or spontaneous action or word.



He is entirely the result of external influences. Man is a transforming machine, a kind of transmitting station of forces. Thus from the point of view of the totality of Gurdjieff's ideas and also according to contemporary "exact positive science," a man differs from animals only in the greater complexity both of his reactions to external impressions and of the structure of his perceptive system. And as for that which is attributed to man and is called "will," Gurdjieff completely denies the possibility of its existence in the common presence of the ordinary man. Will is a certain combination obtained from the results of definite properties specially elaborated in themselves by people who can "do." In the presence of ordinary people what they call "will" is exclusively the
resultant of desires.
Real will is the sign of a very high degree of being in comparison with the being of the ordinary man. And only those who possess such being can "do " All other people are simply automatons, machines, or mechanical toys set in motion by external forces, acting only insofar as the "spring" placed in them acts in response to accidental surrounding conditions—a spring that they can neither lengthen nor shorten, nor change in any way on their own initiative. And so, while recognizing great possibilities in man, we deny him any
value as an independent unit as long as he remains such as he is today.
In order to emphasize the absence of any will whatsoever in the ordinary man,
there can be added here a passage from another of Gurdjieff's talks, in which
the manifestations of this famous will attributed to man are picturesquely de
scribed.
Addressing one of the people present, Gurdjieff said:



"You have plenty of money, luxurious conditions of existence, and
universal esteem and respect. At the head of your well-established business
concerns you have people who are absolutely reliable and devoted to you, in a
word, your life is a bed of roses.
"You dispose of your time as you please, you are a patron of the arts, you
settle world questions over a cup of coffee, and you even take an interest in
the development of the latent spiritual forces of man You are not unfamiliar
with matters of the spirit, and you are quite at home with philosophical
questions You are well educated and widely read Having extensive knowledge
in a variety of fields, you are reputed to be an intelligent man, adept at
resolving any problem whatever You are the very model of culture.
"All who know you regard you as a man of great will, and most of them
even ascribe your success to the result of the manifestations of this will of
yours.
"In short, from every point of view, you fully deserve to be imitated and
are a man to be envied.
"In the morning you wake up under the influence of some oppressive dream. "Your slightly depressed mood, though rapidly dispelled on awakening, has nevertheless left its mark a certain languidness and hesitancy in your movements. "You go to the mirror to brush your hair and carelessly drop the brush, you
have only just picked it up, when you drop it again You then pick it up with a
shade of impatience, and so you drop it for the third time, you try to catch it in
the air, but . . . an unlucky blow of your hand, and the brush makes for the
mirror, in vain you try to grab it . . . too late! Crack! . . . There is a star of
cracks on that antique mirror of which you were so proud.
"Damn! Devil take it! You feel a need to vent your annoyance on someone or other, and not finding the newspaper beside your morning coffee, the servant having forgotten to put



it there, the cup of your patience overflows and you decide that you cannot stand the fellow any longer in the house. "It is time for you to go out. As the weather is fine and you haven't far to go, you decide to walk. Behind you glides your new automobile of the latest model. "The bright sunshine somewhat calms you. A crowd that has collected at the corner attracts your attention "You go nearer, and in the middle of the crowd you see a man lying
unconscious on the pavement. A policeman, with the help of some of the
'bystanders,' puts the man into a taxi to take him to the hospital.
"Thanks merely to the likeness, which has just struck you, between the
face of the taxi driver and the face of the drunken monk you bumped into last
year when you were returning, somewhat tipsy yourself, from a rowdy
birthday party, you notice that the accident on the street corner is
unaccountably connected in your associations with a cake you ate at that party.
"Ah, what a cake that was! "That servant of yours, forgetting your newspaper today, spoiled your
breakfast. Why not make up for it right now?
"Here is a fashionable Café where you sometimes go with your friends.
"But why did you suddenly remember the servant? Had you not almost
entirely forgotten the morning's annoyances? But now . . . how very good the
cake tastes with the coffee.
"Look! There are two young women at the next table. What a charming
blonde!
"You hear her whispering to her companion, as she glances at you 'Now
that's just the sort of man I like!'
"Do you deny that on accidentally overhearing these words, perhaps said
out loud for your benefit, the whole of you, as is said, 'inwardly rejoices'?
"Suppose that at this moment you were asked whether it had been worth while getting worked up and losing your



temper over the morning's annoyances, you would of course answer in the negative and promise yourself that nothing of the kind would ever occur again. "Need I mention how your mood was transformed while you were making the acquaintance of the blonde you were interested in and who was interested in you, and what your state was during the whole time you spent with her? "You return home humming some air, and even the sight of the broken mirror only elicits a smile from you. "But how about the business on which you had gone out this morning? . . . You only now remember it. Clever . . . well, never mind, you can telephone. "You go to the phone and the girl connects you with the wrong number. "You ring again, and get the same number Some man informs you that you are bothering him, you tell him it is not your fault, and what with one word and another, you learn to your surprise that you are a boor and an idiot and that if you ring him up again . . . then . . . "A rug slipping under your feet provokes a storm of indignation, and you should hear the tone of voice in which you rebuke the servant who is handing you a letter! "The letter is from a man you esteem and whose good opinion you value highly. "Its contents are so flattering that, as you read, your irritation subsides and gives way to the 'pleasant embarrassment' of a man listening to a eulogy of himself. You finish reading the letter in the happiest of moods. "I could go on with this picture of your day—you free man!
"Perhaps you think I am exaggerating? "No, it is a photographically exact snapshot, taken from life. "



While speaking of man's will and of the different aspects of its supposedly autonomous manifestations, which for contemporary so-called "inquiring minds"—but in our view, naive minds—serve only as material for wiseacring and self-adulation, it will do no harm to quote what Gurdjieff said in yet another of his talks, because the ideas he brought on that occasion may well throw light on the illusoriness of that will which every man is supposed to have.
He spoke as follows: "A man comes into the world like a clean sheet of paper, which immediately all around him begin vying with each other to dirty and fill up with education, morality, the information we call 'knowledge,' and with all kinds of ideas of duty, honor, conscience, and so on and so forth. "And each and all claim immutability and infallibility for the methods they employ for grafting these branches onto the main trunk, called man's 'personality.' "The sheet of paper gradually becomes dirty, and the dirtier it becomes, that is to say, the more a man is stuffed with ephemeral information and notions of duty, honor, and so on, which are dinned into him or suggested to him by others, the more 'clever' and worthy he is considered by those around him. "And seeing that people look upon his dirt as merit, he himself inevitably comes to look upon the dirtied sheet of paper in the same light. "And so you have a model of what we call a 'man,' to whom such words as
'talent' and 'genius' are frequently applied.
"And the temper of our 'genius' when he wakes up in the morning is
spoiled for the whole day if he does not find his slippers beside the bed.
"The ordinary man is not free in his life, in his manifestations, or in his
moods.



"He cannot be what he would like to be, and what he considers himself to
be, he is not that
"Man—how mighty it sounds! The very name 'man' means the 'acme of
creation', but how does this title fit contemporary man?
"And yet man should indeed be the acme of creation, since he is formed
with and has in himself all the possibilities for acquiring exactly similar data
to those of the Actualizer of all that exists in the Universe.
"To have the right to the name of man, one must be one. "And to be a man, one must first of all, with an indefatigable persistence
and an unquenchable impulse of desire issuing from all the separate
independent parts constituting one's entire common presence, that is to say,
with a desire issuing simultaneously from thought, feeling, and organic
instinct, work on an all-round knowledge of oneself, while struggling
unceasingly with one's subjective weaknesses, and afterward, taking one's
stand upon the results thus obtained by one's consciousness alone regarding
the defects in one's established subjectivity as well as the means for the
possibility of combating them, strive for their eradication without mercy
toward oneself.
"Speaking frankly, contemporary man as we can know him if we are
capable of impartiality is nothing more than a clockwork mechanism, though
of a very complex construction.
"A man must without fail think deeply about every aspect of his
mechanicality and understand it thoroughly, in order to appreciate fully the
meaning of this mechanicality and all the consequences and results it implies,
both for his own further life and for the justification of the sense and aim of
his arising and existence.
"For a man who wishes to study human mechanicality in general and make
it clear to himself, the very best object of study is certainly himself with his
own mechanicality, but



to study this practically and to understand it intelligently with all one's being,
and not 'psychopathically,' that is, with only one part of one's entire presence,
is possible solely by means of correctly conducted self-observation.
"And as regards the possibility of conducting self-observation correctly,
without the risk of incurring any of the maleficent consequences that have
resulted all too often from people's attempts to do this without proper knowl
edge, it is necessary to warn you, in order to avoid excessive zeal, that our
experience, supported by a great deal of exact information, has shown that this
is not as simple a thing as it may appear at first glanc.e That is why we take as
the groundwork for correctly conducted self-observation the study of the
mechanicality of contemporary man.
"Before beginning to study this mechanicality and all the principles of
correctly conducted self-observation, a man must decide, once and for all, that
he will be unconditionally sincere with himself, that he will shut his eyes to
nothing, will shun no results wherever they may lead him, fear no inferences,
and impose no limits upon himself in advance, furthermore, in order that these
principles may be properly perceived and assimilated by each of the followers
of this new teaching, an appropriate form of 'language' must be established,
since we find the existing form quite unsuitable for such a study.
"As regards the first condition, it is necessary at the very outset to give
warning that a man, unaccustomed to thinking and acting along lines that
correspond to the principles of self-observation, will need great courage to
accept sincerely the conclusions reached and not lose heart, but submit to
them and continue to follow these principles with the crescendo of persistence
that this study obligatorily demands.
"These conclusions may, as is said, 'upset' all the convictions and beliefs
deep-rooted in a man, as well as the whole



order of his usual thinking, and in that event, he may be robbed, perhaps forever, of all the pleasant 'values dear to his heart' which have hitherto made up his calm and serene life. "Thanks to correctly conducted self-observation, a man, from the very first days, will clearly grasp and recognize without question his complete powerlessness and helplessness in the face of literally everything around him. "With the whole of his being he will be convinced that everything governs him, everything directs him. He neither governs nor directs anything at all. "He is attracted or repelled not only by everything animate which has in
itself the capacity of arousing one or another association in him, but even by
entirely inert and inanimate things.
"If he frees himself of all imagination about himself and of all selfcalming—impulses which have become inherent in contemporary people—he will recognize that his whole life is nothing but a blind reacting to these attractions and repulsions. "He will see clearly how his so-called 'world outlook,' his opinions, character, taste, and so on, have been molded—in short, how his individuality has been formed and under what influences it is liable to be changed.
"And as regards the second condition, that is, the establishment of a correct language, this is indispensable because our recently adopted language, which has acquired, as it were, 'rights of citizenship,' and in which we speak, write books, and convey our knowledge and ideas to others has, in our view, become quite worthless for any more or less exact exchange of opinions. "The words that make up our contemporary language, owing to the arbitrary meaning people put into them, con



vey only indefinite and relative notions, and are thus taken by ordinary people
'elastically. '
"In producing this abnormality in the life of man, a large part was played,
in our opinion, by that same abnormal system of education of the rising
generation.
"And it played a large part because by compelling the young, as we have
already said, to repeat like parrots the greatest possible number of words,
teaching them to differentiate one from another only by their sound, as
though the real pith of their meaning had no importance, this system of
education has resulted in the gradual loss in people of the capacity to ponder
and reflect upon what they are talking about and upon what is being said to
them.
"Having lost this capacity and at the same time needing to convey their
thoughts more or less exactly to others, they are obliged, in spite of the
endless number of words already existing in each of the contemporary
languages, either to borrow from other languages or to invent always more
and more words, so that finally, when a contemporary man wishes to express
an idea for which he knows many apparently suitable words, and chooses one
that seems according to his mental reflection to be the most fitting, he still in
stinctively feels uncertain whether his choice is correct, and unconsciously
gives the word his own subjective meaning.
"Owing to this already automatized habit and to the gradual disappearance
of the capacity to concentrate his active attention for any length of time, the
ordinary man on saying or hearing any word involuntarily emphasizes and
dwells upon one or another aspect of the idea conveyed by the word,
invariably limiting the whole meaning of the word to this one aspect, that is
to say, this word, instead of including all the implications of the given idea,
expresses only the first meaning that happens to come to him, depending
upon the automatic associations flowing in him. Hence every



time the contemporary man hears or utters one and the same word in the
course of conversation, he gives it a different meaning, often quite
contradictory to the full sense conveyed by the word.
"For any man who is to some extent aware of this, and has learned more or
less how to observe, the conversation of two contemporary people is a
'tragicomic feast of sound' which becomes particularly evident when others
join it.
"Each of them puts his own subjective meaning into all the words that
have become centers of gravity in that so to say 'symphony of words without
content,' which to the ear of this impartial and informed observer is simply
what is called in the ancient 'sinokooloopianian' tales of The Thousand and
One Nights, 'cacophonous, fantastic nonsense. '
"While conversing in this way, contemporary people imagine that they
understand one another and are even certain they are communicating their
thoughts to one another.
"We, on the other hand, relying upon a mass of indisputable data
confirmed by psycho-physico-chemical experiments, categorically affirm that
as long as contemporary people remain what they are, that is, 'ordinary
people,' they will never, whatever they may be talking about among
themselves, and particularly if the subject is abstract, understand the same
ideas from the same words, nor will they ever actually understand one
another.
"That is why in the ordinary contemporary man, every inner experience,
even a painful one, that might oblige him to think and lead him to logical
results which could be very beneficial to those around him, remains
unexpressed and is only transformed into a so to say 'enslaving factor' for
himself.
"For this reason, the isolation of the inner life of each individual is
increased, and as a consequence the 'mutual instruction' so necessary to
people's collective existence is disappearing more and more.



"Owing to the loss of the capacity to ponder and reflect, whenever the average contemporary man hears or uses in conversation any word familiar to him only by its sound, he does not pause to think, nor does he even ask himself exactly what is meant by this word, since he has already decided, once and for all, that he knows it and that others know it too. "Perhaps a question does arise in him when he hears an entirely unfamiliar word for the first time, but in this case he is content merely to substitute another word with a familiar sound, and then to imagine that he has understood it. "To bring home what has just been said, an excellent example is provided by a word very often used by every contemporary man—the word 'world.' "If people could grasp all that goes on in their thoughts every time they hear or say the word 'world,' most of them would have to admit—if of course they were willing to be sincere—that the word carries no exact notion whatever for them Simply catching by ear the accustomed sound of this word, the meaning of which they assume they know, they say to themselves, as it were, 'Ah . . . world . . . I know what that is,' and serenely continue on their way "If someone deliberately drew their attention to this word and knew how to get them to say just what they understood by it, they would at first be plainly embarrassed but, quickly pulling themselves together, that is to say, quickly deceiving themselves and recalling the first definition of the word that came to mind, they would present it as their own, although, in fact, they had not thought about it before. "And if one had the authority to oblige a number of contemporary people, even from among those who have received what is called a 'good education,' to state exactly how they each understood the word 'world,' they would all 'beat about the bush' so much that one would involuntarily recall.



castor oil with a certain tenderness For instance, one of these people, who
among other things had read up a few books on astronomy, would say that the
'world' is a multitude of suns surrounded by planets at colossal distances from
each other, forming together what we call the 'Milky Way', beyond which, at
immeasurable distances and beyond the limits of space accessible to our
investigations, are presumably other constellations and other worlds.
"Another, interested in contemporary physics, would speak of the 'world'
as a systematic evolution of matter, beginning with the atom and going up to
the very largest aggregates such as planets and suns, he would perhaps refer
to the theory of the similitude of the world of atoms and electrons and the
world of suns and planets, and so on in the same strain.
"Still another who, for some reason or other, had made a hobby of
philosophy and read all the mish-mash on that subject, would say that the
'world' is only the product of our subjective picturings and imaginings, and
that our earth, for example, with its mountains and seas, its vegetable and
animal kingdoms, is all a world of appearances, an illusory world.
"A man acquainted with the latest theories of polydimensional space
would say that the 'world' is usually considered as an infinite three
dimensional sphere, but that in reality a three-dimensional world cannot exist
as such, and is only an imaginary cross section of another four-dimensional
world, from which comes everything proceeding around us and into which
everything returns.
"A man whose world view is founded on the dogmas of religion would
state that the 'world' is everything existing, visible and invisible, created by
God and dependent on His Will. In the visible world our life is brief, but in the
invisible world, where a man receives reward or punishment for all



his deeds during his sojourn in the visible world, life is eternal.
"One bitten with 'spiritualism' would say that, side by side with the visible
world there exists another, a 'world' of the 'beyond,' and that communications
have already been established with the beings populating this world of the
'beyond.'
"A fanatic of theosophy would go still further and say that seven 'worlds'
exist which interpenetrate each other and are composed of more and more
rarefied matter, and so on.
"In short, not a single one of our contemporaries would be able to offer an
exact definition, acceptable to all, of the real meaning of the word 'world.'
"The whole inner life of the ordinary man is nothing but an 'automatized
contact' between two or three series of associations made up of impressions
previously perceived by him and fixed in each of his three differently natured
localizations or 'brains,' through the action of some chance impulse arising in
him When these associations reappear, that is to say, when corresponding
impressions are repeated, one can see that under the influence of some
accidental inner or outer shock, impressions of the same nature are repeated in
another localization.
"All the particularities of the world view of the ordinary man and the
characteristic features of his individuality ensue from and depend on the
sequence of impulses arising in him at the moment of perceiving new
impressions, and also on the automatism established for starting the process of
repetition of those impressions.
"And it is this that explains the incongruity, which can be observed even by
the ordinary man, of the various associations having nothing in common that
flow simultaneously in him during his passive state.



"These impressions are perceived in a man's common presence by means
of three apparatuses in him which act as perceivers of the seven what are
called 'planetary center-of-gravity vibrations,' found in him as in all animals.
"The structure of these three perceiving apparatuses in man is the same for
each part of the mechanism.
"They resemble clean wax gramophone 'disks', and on these disks or, as
they might otherwise be called, 'reels,' all the impressions received are
recorded, from the first days after a man's appearance in the world, and even
before, during the period of his formation in his mother's womb.
"And the different apparatuses constituting this general mechanism also
possess a certain automatic device, thanks to which newly entering
impressions, in addition to being recorded alongside similar ones previously
perceived, are also recorded in chronological order.
"Thus every impression experienced is recorded in several places on
several reels, and on these reels it is preserved unchanged.
"These impressed perceptions have the property, on contact with vibrations
of the same nature and quality, of, so to say, 'rousing themselves,' and an
action is then repeated in them similar to the one that evoked their first arising.
"And it is this repetition of previously perceived impressions that
engenders what is called an 'association', and the parts of this repetition that
enter the field of a man's attention condition what is called 'memory. '
"The memory of an ordinary man, compared with that of a man who is
harmoniously developed, is very imperfectly adapted for the utilization during
his responsible life of his store of previously perceived impressions.
"With the aid of his memory, an ordinary man can use and keep track of only
a tiny part of his whole store of



impressions, whereas the memory proper to a real man keeps track of all his impressions without exception, no matter when they were perceived. "Many experiments have been made, establishing with indubitable
exactitude that every man in certain states, as for example in a certain stage of
hypnosis, can remember everything that has ever happened to him down to
the most minute particular, he can remember all the details of his
surroundings and the faces and voices of the people near him even in the first
days of his life, when he was still, according to people's notions, an
unconscious being.
"When a man is in one of these states, it is possible, by artificial means, to
set in motion the reels hidden in even the most obscure corners of his
mechanism But it also happens that these reels begin unwinding of
themselves under the influence of some overt or hidden shock evoked by
some experiencing, whereupon there suddenly rise up before the man long
forgotten scenes, picturings, faces, and so on. "
At this point I interrupted the reader of the lecture, considering it
opportune to make the following addition:
THE ADDITION
Such is the ordinary average man—an unconscious slave, entirely at the
service of all-universal purposes alien to his personal individuality.
He may live through all his years as he is, and as such be destroyed forever.
However, Great Nature has given him the possibility of not being merely a
blind tool entirely at the service of these all-universal objective purposes but,
while serving her and actualizing what is foreordained for him, which is the
lot of every breathing creature, of working at the same time for himself, for
his own "egoistic" individuality.



This possibility also was given him for serving the common purpose since,
for the equilibrium of these objective laws, such relatively liberated people
are necessary.
Although this liberation is possible, nevertheless whether any particular
man has a chance to attain it—this is difficult to say.
There are a great many reasons which may not permit it and which in most
cases depend neither upon us personally nor upon great cosmic laws, but only
upon the various accidental conditions of our arising and formation, that is to
say, chiefly upon heredity and the various circumstances during the process
of our "preparatory age " It is just these uncontrollable conditions which may
not permit this liberation.
The chief difficulty in the way of liberation from complete slavery is that
we must, with an intention coming from our own initiative and a persistence
sustained by our own efforts—that is to say, not by another's will but by our
own—succeed in eradicating from our presence both the already fixed
consequences of certain properties of that "something" in our forefathers
called the "organ kundabuffer," as well as the predisposition to those
consequences which may again arise.
To give you at least an approximate understanding of this strange organ
and its properties, and also of the manifestations in ourselves of the
consequences of these properties, we must dwell a little longer upon this
question and speak about it in somewhat greater detail.
Great Nature, in her foresight, for many important reasons—about which
theoretical explanations will be given in later lectures—was constrained to
place within the common presence of our remote ancestors a special organ,
through whose properties they might be protected from the possibility of
seeing and feeling reality.



Although this organ was later removed by Great Nature from their
common presence, yet owing to the cosmic law of "the assimilation of the
results of oft-repeated acts"— according to which, from the frequent
repetition of the same act there appears in every cosmic concentration, under
certain conditions, a tendency to reproduce similar results— the
predisposition formed in our ancestors was transmitted by heredity from
generation to generation, so that when their descendants established many
conditions in the process of their ordinary existence that proved to be
favorable for its law-conformable manifestation, the consequences of the
various properties of this organ began to arise in them and, passing by
heredity from generation to generation, were gradually assimilated and
ultimately engendered almost the same manifestations as in their ancestors.
To understand at least approximately how these consequences manifest
themselves in us, let us consider a further fact that is perfectly intelligible to
our Reason and beyond any doubt whatever.
All men are mortal and each of us may die at any moment. Now the question arises can a man really picture to himself, and so to say
"experience" in his consciousness, the process of his own death?
No! His own death and the experiencing of this process, a man, however he
may wish, can never picture to himself.
An ordinary contemporary man can picture to himself the death of another,
though even this not fully.
He can picture to himself, for instance, a certain Mr Smith leaving the
theater and, on crossing the street, being run over by an automobile and
crushed to death.
Or a signboard blown down by the wind falls on the head of Mr Jones, who
happens to be passing, and kills him on the spot.



Or Mr Brown, who has eaten spoiled crayfish, gets poisoned and, since no
one is able to save him, dies the next day.
Anyone can easily picture all these. But can the ordinary man contemplate for himself the same possibility as he admits for Mr Smith, Mr Jones, and Mr Brown, and really feel and live through all the despair of facing such an eventuality for himself? Think what would be the state of a man who could clearly picture to himself and experience the inevitability of his own death! If he seriously ponders and succeeds in entering deeply into this so as really to cognize his own death, what could be more terrifying? In ordinary life, over and above the terrible fact of the inevitability of our own death, there are many other things, particularly in recent times, which, if we would even imagine having to live through them, would evoke in us feelings of inexpressible and intolerable anguish. Suppose that those contemporary people who have already entirely lost all possibility of having any real objective hope for the future, that is to say, those who have never "sown" anything during their responsible life and therefore have nothing to "reap" in the future, suppose that one day they should become aware of the inevitability of their imminent death—from the thought alone they would hang themselves. As a result of the specific action of the consequences of the properties of the organ kundabuffer on their common psyche, most contemporary peoplethose three-brained beings in whom were placed the hopes of our Creator as possible servers of higher purposes—are prevented from knowing any of these genuine terrors And thus they are able calmly to carry on their existence in unconscious fulfillment of what was foreordained, but in the service only



of Nature's most immediate aims, since on account of their unbecoming, abnormal life they have lost any possibility of serving higher purposes. Owing to these consequences, not only does the recognition of such terrors
fail to arise in the psyche of contemporary people, but to calm themselves they
even invent all kinds of fantastic explanations, which are plausible solely to
their naive logic, for what they really sense and also for what they do not sense
at all.
For example, suppose that the question of our inability really to sense various
genuine terrors, in particular the terror of our own death, should become a
"burning question of the day," as occurs from time to time with certain
questions in contemporary life, then in all probability everybody, ordinary
mortals as well as those called "learned," would offer a categorical solution
which they would not doubt for a moment and, "spluttering at the mouth,"
would set about to prove that what in fact saves people from experiencing
such terrors is just their own "will."
But if this is conceded, why does not this presumed will protect us from all
the little fears that assail us at every step?
In order to sense and understand what I am now saying with your whole
being, and not merely with that "mind-fornication" of yours, which to the
misfortune of our descendants has become the dominant inherency of contem
porary people, picture to yourself the following.
Tonight, after the lecture, you go home, undress, and get into bed but, just
as you are pulling up the covers, a mouse jumps out from under the pillow
and, scuttling across your body, disappears into the folds of the blankets.
Admit candidly, does not a shiver actually run through your whole body at
the bare thought of such a thing?
Is it not so? Now please try to make an exception and, without the



participation of any of the subjective emotionality that has become fixed in
you, picture to yourself with your thought alone that such a thing might
happen to you, and you will then be amazed that you would react in such a
way.
What is so frightening about this? It is just an ordinary house mouse, the most inoffensive of creatures.
And so I ask you, how can all that has been said be explained by that "will"
which is presumed to be in every man?
How is it possible to reconcile the fact that a man is terrified by a timid
little mouse, the most frightened of all creatures, and by thousands of similar
trifles which might never even occur, and yet experiences no terror in the face
of the inevitability of his own death?
In any case, to explain such a flagrant contradiction by the action of the
famous human "will" is impossible.
When this contradiction is considered soberly, without any preconceptions,
that is, without any of the ready-made notions of various so-called
"authorities"—whose wiseacrings have taken hold of people on account of
their naïveté and "herd instinct," not to mention the results arising in their
mentation from an abnormal education—it becomes perfectly obvious that all
these fears from which there does not arise in a man an impulse, as we said,
to hang himself are expressly permitted by Nature to the extent to which they
are indispensable for the process of our ordinary existence.
And indeed without them—without all these, in the objective sense, "flea
bites," which appear to us as "unprecedented terrors"—we could not have any
experiencings at all, whether of joy, sorrow, hope, disappointment, and so on,
nor could we have all those cares, stimuli, strivings, or in general any of the
impulses that constrain us to act, to attain something, and to strive toward
some aim.



It is just this totality of "childish experiencings," as they might be called,
arising and flowing automatically m the ordinary man, which, on the one
hand, make up and sustain his life and, on the other hand, leave him neither
the possibility nor the time to see and feel reality.
If the ordinary contemporary man were somehow to sense, or to remember
if only in thought, that at a definite known date, for instance tomorrow, a
week, or a month, or even a year or two hence, he would die and die for
certain, what would remain, one asks, of all that until then had filled up and
constituted his life?
Everything would lose its sense and significance for him What would be
the importance of the decoration he received yesterday for long service and
which had so delighted him, or that glance he just noticed, so full of promise,
from the woman who had long been the object of his constant and unrewarded
longing, or the newspaper with his morning coffee, and that deferential
greeting from his neighbor on the stairs, and the theater in the evening, and
rest and sleep all his favorite things—what worth would they all have?
Certainly they would no longer have the significance which he had given
them before if a man knew that death would overtake him only in five or ten
years.
In short, to look his own death "in the face" the ordinary man cannot and
must not do, for he would, so to say, "get out of his depth" and in clear-cut
form the question would arise before him "Why then should we live and toil
and suffer?"
Precisely that such a question may not arise, Great Nature, having become
convinced that in the common presence of most people there are no longer
any factors for meritorious manifestations proper to three-centered beings, has
providentially and wisely protected them by allowing the arising in their
common presence of various consequences of those



properties unbecoming to them which, in the absence of proper actualizations,
permit them not to perceive or sense reality.
And Great Nature was constrained to adapt herself to such an abnormality,
in the objective sense, because owing to the conditions of ordinary life
established by men themselves, the deterioration in quality of the radiations
required of them for higher common-cosmic purposes insistently demanded,
for the maintenance of equilibrium, an adaptation in the number of arisings
and in the duration of these lives.
Thus it is clear that life is given to men not for themselves but for serving
these higher cosmic purposes, and that is why Great Nature watches over this
life so that it may flow in a more or less tolerable form, and takes care that it
should not prematurely ceas.e
Do not we also—we men—feed, watch over, look after, and make the lives
of our sheep and pigs as comfortable as possible?
Do we do all this because we value their lives for the sake of their lives?
No! We do all this in order to slaughter them one fine day and to obtain the
meat we need, with as much fat as possible.
In the same way Nature takes all measures to ensure that we shall live
without seeing the terror, and not hang ourselves, but live long, and then,
when we are required, she slaughters us.
In the established conditions of the ordinary life of people, this has already
become an immutable law of Nature.
There is in our life a certain very great purpose and we must all serve this
great common purpose—in this lies the whole sense and predestination of our
life.
All people without exception are slaves of this "Greatness," and all are
compelled willy-nilly to submit, and to fulfill without condition or
compromise what has been pre



destined for each of us by his transmitted heredity and his acquired being.
Now, after all that I have said, coming back to the chief theme of the lecture
read here today, I wish to remind you of the expressions employed several
times in defining man—namely, "real man" and "man in quotation marks,"
and in conclusion to say this:
Although the real man who has already acquired his own "I," and the man
in quotation marks who has not, are equally slaves of that same "Greatness,"
the difference between them, as I have already said, consists in this, that since
the attitude of the first toward his slavery is conscious, he acquires the
possibility, even while serving the "all-universal actualizing," of applying a
part of his manifestations, according to the providence of Great Nature, to the
attainment of "imperishable Being", whereas the second, not cognizing his
slavery, serves during the entire process of his existence merely as a thing,
which, when no longer needed, disappears forever.
In order to make what I have just said more comprehensible and concrete, let
us compare human life in general to a large river that rises from various
sources and flows on the surface of our planet, and the life of any particular
man to one of the drops of water composing this river of life.
The river at first flows as a whole along a comparatively level valley, and
then at the place where Nature has undergone what is called a "cataclysm not
according to law," it divides into two separate streams or, as is also said, there
occurs a "dividing of the waters."
All of the water of one stream, soon after passing this place, flows into a
still more level valley and, without any "majestic or picturesque" scenery to
hinder it, ultimately flows into the vast ocean.



The second stream continues to flow through obstacles formed by the
"cataclysm not according to law" just mentioned, and ultimately falls into
crevices which are themselves consequences of the same cataclysm, and seeps
into the very depths of the Earth.
Although after the "dividing of the waters" these two streams flow
independently and no longer mingle, at certain moments they approach so
near each other that all the results engendered from the process of their
flowing blend, and even at times, during great atmospheric phenomena such
as winds, storms, and so on, splashes of water, or even single drops, pass from
one stream into the othe.
Taken individually, the life of every man until reaching responsible age
corresponds to a drop of water in the initial current of the river, and the place
where the "dividing of the waters" occurs corresponds to the time when he
attains adulthood.
Before this division, every movement of the waters for fulfilling the
predetermined destination of the entire river, according to law, applies as a
whole as well as in its smallest details to each separate drop equally, but only
inasmuch as the given drop is contained in the general flow of the whole river.
For the drop itself, all its own displacements, all the directions it takes, and
all the states caused by its changes of position, by various accidental
surrounding conditions, and by the speeding up or slowing down of the tempo
of its movement, are always entirely a matter of chance.
For the drops, there is no predetermination of their personal fate—a
predetermined fate is for the whole river only.
At the beginning of the flow of the river of life, the drops are here one
moment, there the next, and a moment later they may not exist at all as such,
having splashed out of the river and evaporated.
And so when, on account of the unbecoming life of men,



Great Nature was constrained to bring about a corresponding degeneration in
their common presence, it was established for the purposes of the common
actualizing of everything existing that the whole of human life on Earth would
be divided into two streams, and Great Nature foresaw, and gradually fixed in
the details of her common actualization, a certain law-conforming process
whereby in the drops of water of the initial flow of the river of life, during
what are called "inner subjective struggles against one's own denying
principle," there might arise or not arise that "something" thanks to which
certain properties are acquired that give the possibility, at the place of the
"dividing of the waters," of entering one stream or the other.
This "something," which in the presence of each drop of water serves to
actualize the property corresponding to one or the other of the streams,
represents in the common presence of each man who attains responsible age
that "I" which was referred to in today's lecture .
A man who has his own "I" enters one of the streams of the river of life,
and the man who has not, enters the other.
The subsequent fate of each drop in the river of life is determined at the
"dividing of the waters," according to the stream it enters.
And this is because, as I have already said, the first of these two streams
ultimately empties into the ocean, that is, into that sphere of Nature which has
frequent reciprocal "exchanges of substances" with various great cosmic con
centrations through the process of what is called "pokhdalissdjancha," one
aspect of which, by the way, contemporary people call "cyclones " And
thereby the drop of water has the possibility of evolving, as it is, to the next
higher concentration.
And as for the other stream, which at the end of its course flows into the
crevices of the Earth's nether regions, where it participates in what is called
"involutionary creation" pro



ceeding continuously within the planet, it is transformed into vapor and distributed to corresponding spheres to serve for new arisings. After the "dividing of the waters," great and small successive processes that assure the fulfillment of the predetermined destination of each stream, even in the details of their outer movement, also ensue from these same cosmic laws, however, the results ensuing from them are so to say "subjectivized" correspondingly in the two streams, and although they function independently, they mutually assist and sustain each other all the time. These "subjectivized" second-order results, issuing from fundamental
cosmic laws, sometimes function side by side, sometimes collide or cross,
but never blend And the action of these "subjectivized" second-order results
can sometimes, in certain surrounding conditions, also extend to the separate
drops.
For us contemporary people, the chief evil is that, owing to the various conditions of ordinary existence established by ourselves, especially our abnormal "education," we reach responsible age having acquired a presence that corresponds only to that stream of the river of life destined to empty itself into the nether regions, and falling into it, are carried along wherever and however it wills, and without pondering the consequences we remain passive and, submitting to the flow, drift on and on. As long as we remain passive, not only shall we have inevitably to serve solely as a means for Nature's "involutionary creation" but for the rest of our lives we shall have to submit slavishly to the caprice of all sorts of blind events. As most of the listeners present today have already, as is said, "crossed over" into responsible age and sincerely recognize that until now they have not acquired their own "I" and, at the same time, according to the substance of all I



have said here, have not pictured any particularly agreeable perspectives for
themselves, then, in order that you—just you who recognize this—should not
be too greatly "disheartened" and fall into the usual "pessimism" everywhere
prevalent in the abnormal life of contemporary people, I say quite frankly,
without any "arrière-pensée," that according to my convictions formed over
long years of investigations and strengthened by numerous experiments
conducted in a quite exceptional way—on the results of which are based the
Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man— even for you, it is not
yet too late.
The point is that these investigations and experiments showed me
definitely and clearly that in her infinite care, Mother Nature has foreseen the
possibility for beings to acquire the kernel of their essence, that is to say, their
own "I," even after they have reached responsible age.
The foresight of our just Mother Nature consists in our case in this, that the
possibility is given us, in certain inner and outer conditions, to cross over
from one stream into the other.
The expression "the first liberation of man," which has reached us from
ancient times, refers to just this possibility of crossing over from the stream
that is predestined to disappear into the nether regions into the stream that
empties itself into the vast spaces of the boundless ocean.
But to cross over into the other stream is not so easy "merely to wish and
you cross " For this, it is first of all necessary consciously to crystallize in
yourselves data for engendering in your common presence a constant, un
quenchable impulse of desire for this crossing, and then afterward to undergo
a long corresponding preparation.
For this crossing you are required above all to renounce everything that
you consider "riches" in this stream of life, but which in reality are
automatically and slavishly acquired habits.



In other words, you have to die to everything that makes up your ordinary life.
It is just this death that is spoken of in all religions. This is the meaning of the saying which has reached us from remote
antiquity, "Without death no resurrection," or in other words, "If you do not
die, you will not be raised from the dead. "
It is not a question of the death of the body, since for such a death there is
no need of resurrection.
For if there is a soul and, moreover, an immortal soul, it can dispense with a resurrection of the body. Nor is resurrection needed for our appearance before the Last Judgment of
the Lord God, as we have been taught by the Fathers of the Church.
No! Even Jesus Christ himself and all the prophets sent from Above spoke
of the death that can occur here in this life, that is to say, of the death of that
"tyrant" from whom proceeds our slavery, and solely on the liberation from
whom depends the first chief liberation of man.
In summing up all that has been said—the ideas in the lecture you have heard
and what I have added today—about the two categories of contemporary
people who in respect of their inner content have nothing in common, and
about the grievous fact that owing to the progressively deteriorating
conditions of ordinary life, particularly the wrong system of education of the
rising generation, the various consequences of the properties of the organ
kundabuffer appear much more intensely in the common presence of people
in recent times, I consider it necessary to say, and even to emphasize, that all
misunderstandings arising in the process of our collective life, especially in
our mutual relationships, all disagreements, disputes, settlings of accounts,
and hasty decisions—decisions which after being carried out evoke in



us the lingering process of "remorse of conscience"—and even such great events as wars, civil wars, and other calamities are simply the results of a property of the common presence of ordinary people who have never specially worked on themselves, which I would call "reflecting reality upside down. "
Every man who can think even a little seriously, without being so to speak "identified" with his passions, must agree with this if he takes into account only one simple fact often repeated in the process of our inner life, namely, that all our experiences that seem so dreadful while we are going through them appear to our logical reasoning to be "not worth a red cent" after a lapse of only a short time, during which they have been replaced by other experiences and chance to be recalled when we are already in another mood. The results of his thinking and feeling often lead the average man to make, as it might be expressed, "a fly out of an elephant and an elephant out of a fly."
The manifestations of this harmful property in the common presence of people become particularly intense during such events as wars, revolutions, civil wars, and so on At such times a state, recognizable even by them, is most acutely manifested, under the influence of which with rare exceptions they all fall, and which they call "mass psychosis." The chief characteristic of this state is that when ordinary people with their
already feeble mentation, which at such times becomes still feebler, receive
shocks from the maleficent stories of some lunatic or other, they become in
the full sense of the word victims of these malicious stories and manifest
themselves completely automatically.
While they are under the influence of this maleficent property, already permanently rooted in ordinary contemporary people, there ceases to exist in their common presence that



sacred "something" called "conscience," whose acquisition was possible for
them thanks to the data with which they were endowed by Great Nature, as
godlike beings in contrast to mere animals.
Knowledgeable people sincerely regret this property in our contemporaries
because, according to historical data as well as the discoveries of many
genuine learned beings of past epochs, Great Nature no longer has any need
for such a phenomenon as mass psychosis for maintaining her equilibrium On
the contrary, the periodic manifestation of this property in people compels her
again and again to make new adaptations, for instance, increasing the birth
rate, changing what is called the "tempo of the general psyche," and so on and
so forth.
After everything I have said, I consider it necessary to emphasize further that
all the historical data that have reached certain contemporary people and have
also happened to become known to me concerning what really did occur in the
life of people of former times, and not just those data invented by
contemporary so-called "scholars," chiefly the Germans—whose "histories"
have stuffed the brains of all the rising generation almost everywhere on
Earth—clearly show that men of past epochs did not divide into two streams
of life, but that all flowed along in a single river.
The general life of mankind has been divided into two streams only since
the time of what is called the "Tikliamishian civilization," which immediately
preceded the Babylonian civilization.
From that time on there was gradually established the present mode of
existence of mankind which, as every sane-thinking man must acknowledge,
can flow more or less tolerably only if people are divided into masters and
slaves.
Although to be either masters or slaves is equally unworthy of men as
children of our Common Father, yet, in



the existing conditions already thoroughly fixed in the process of the collective life of people, the origin of which lies in remote antiquity, we must be reconciled to this and accept a compromise, which according to impartial reasoning corresponds to our own personal welfare and at the same time is not contrary to the commandments specially issuing to us men from the "Prime Source of everything existing. " Such a compromise is possible, in my opinion, if certain people consciously undertake, as the chief aim of their existence, to acquire in their presences all the corresponding data to become masters among those around them similar to themselves. Proceeding from this and acting according to the wise saying of ancient
times, which affirms that "in order to be a just and good altruist one must first
of all be an out-and-out egoist," each one of us, making use of the common
sense given us by Great Nature, must set as his chief aim to become a master.
But not a master in the sense that this word conveys to contemporary people, namely, one who has many slaves and much money, usually handed down by inheritance, but in the sense of a man who, thanks to his objectively virtuous acts toward those around him—that is, acts manifested according to the dictates of his pure Reason alone, without the least participation of those impulses engendered in him as in all people by the consequences of the properties of that maleficent organ kundabuffer—acquires in himself that "something" which impels all those around him to bow before him and with reverence to carry out his orders.
I now consider this first series of my writings completed, and completed in just such a form as satisfies even myself. In any case, I give myself my word that from tomorrow I shall not spend
even five more minutes of my time on this first series.



And now, before setting to work on the second series of my writings, in
order to give it a form accessible to everyone, I intend to rest for a whole
month, to write absolutely nothing and, for a stimulus to my organism,
fatigued to the extreme limit, slow-ly to drink the still remaining fifteen
bottles of "super-most-super heavenly nectar" which at the present time is
known on Earth as "Old Calvados."
This Old Calvados, by the way—twenty-seven bottles of it—I was
considered worthy to find by accident buried under a mixture of lime, sand,
and finely chopped straw, several years ago when I was digging a pit for
storing carrots for the winter in one of the cellars of my present chief dwelling
place.
The bottles of this divine liquid were buried in all probability by monks
who had lived in this place, far from worldly temptations, for the salvation of
their souls.
It now seems to me that it was not without some ulterior motive that they
buried these bottles there, and that, by virtue of what is called their "intuitive
perspicacity"—the data for which, one must assume, were formed in them
thanks to their pious lives—they foresaw that this divine liquid would fall into
hands worthy of understanding the meaning of such things, and that it would
stimulate the owner of these hands to sustain the meaning of the ideals on
which the corporation of these monks was founded and assist their better
transmission to the next generation.
During this rest of mine, fully deserved from any point of view, I wish to
drink this splendid liquid, which alone during recent years has given me the
possibility of tolerating, without suffering, beasts similar to myself around me,
and to listen to new anecdotes, and sometimes for lack of new ones, old
ones—provided, of course, that the storyteller is a good one.



It is still midday, and as I have given my word not to write anything further
for this first series, starting only from tomorrow, I still have time and, without
breaking my word, can add with a clean conscience that a year or two ago I
categorically decided to publish only the first series of my writings As regards
the second and third series, my intention was not to publish them but to
organize their distribution in order, among other things, to fulfill through them
one of the fundamental tasks I have set myself under essence-oath, namely, to
prove to all my contemporaries, cost what it may, the absurdity of all their
inherent ideas concerning the supposed existence of a certain "other world"
with its famous and so beautiful a "paradise" and its so repugnant a "hell", and
at the same time to establish theoretically and afterward demonstrate
practically—so that even a "complete victim" of contemporary education
would have to understand, not without a shudder—that Hell and Paradise do
indeed exist, only not "in another world" but here beside us on Earth.
After the publication of the first series, I intend, for the spreading of the
ideas contained in the second series, to organize in various large centers
simultaneous public readings accessible to all.
And as regards the real, indubitably comprehensible objective truths that
have been brought to light by me in the third series, I wish to make this series
accessible exclusively to those who, after listening to the second series of my
writings, will be selected by specially prepared people according to my
considered instructions.
