LIST OF HIEROGLYPHIC SIGNS
IN the following pages an attempt is made to enumerate the commonest hieroglyphs found in Middle Egyptian, to determine the objects depicted by them, and to illustrate their uses. It would be easy enough to augment our list very considerably, though there might be difficulty in finding good forms of the rarer signs which would then have to be included. But such an augmentation might well do more harm than good, by unduly dispersing the student's interest, instead of concentrating it upon the signs most frequently met with. It must never be forgotten that in the eyes of the old Egyptians the hieroglyphic writing always remained a system of pictorial representation as well as a script. Hence the capricious variety exhibited in the more elaborate inscriptions. To take but one example, the sign for' statue'
Ii (A 22) is apt to change sex, head-gear, dress and accoutrements according as the context or the scribe's fancy may dictate. This is the principal reason why the printing of hieroglyphic texts is so unsatisfactory. No fount of type is sufficiently rich or sufficiently adaptable to do justice to the Egyptian originals. Indeed, there is only one wholly satisfactory method of publishing hieroglyphic texts, namely reproduction in facsimile. Two possibilities here present themselves, facsimile by hand and facsimile by photography. The objection to facsimile by hand is, of course, the very laborious nature of the process. Facsimile by photography has the disadvantage that it will serve only for perfectly preserved texts. As a second-best alternative, the employment of autography is to be recommended, as in Sethe's Urkultdm der I8. Dynastic and in the Brussels Bibliotheca Aegyptiaca. The printing of hieroglyphic texts in type is really suitable only for grammatical or lexicographical works, especially where the hieroglyphs are to be combined with European characters. The discussion of this question is not without a practical purpose; it aims at impressing upon the student the great
desirability of a good hieroglyphic handwritz"ng. Far too lax standards in this respect have been tolerated in the past, and one of our principal aims in creating the new fount of type here employed for the first time was to give a fresh impetus to this side of the hieroglyphic scholar's trauung. The forms shown in the new fount are those normally used in the tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty, though in some cases earlier forms had to be added in order to elucidate pictorial meanings which by that time had become either modified or forgotten. The beginner may safely use our types as his models, but he must realize that copying from the actual monuments gives a knowledge of hieroglyphic writing unobtainable in any other way. The commonest hieroglyphs received their traditional, relatively stereotyped, forms in the very earliest Dynasties. Misinterpretations and confusions may, therefore, be expected at least as far back as the time of the Pyramid-builders. Some of the objects depicted may have
been obsolete at a still more remote date, exx. the three-toothed harpoon of bone 1(T 20) and the form of mast represented by , (P 6). In other cases it is the method of depiction, not the object itself, which had become obsolete by the time that inscriptions began to be plentiful.

LIST OF HIEROGLYPHIC SIGNS Sign-list
Who would have guessed that 111- (D 61) represents human toes? This interpretation is, however, supported by the form of that sign in the tomb of Metjen (Dyn. III), where the toe-nails are clearly marked, and is clinched by the fact that the word t11-~ Site means' toe '. The investigation of the pictorial meaning of the hieroglyphs is for this reason a very difficult task. But it is a task the interest of which is not confined to archaeology alone, since important lexicographical conclusions depend on the right understanding of the signs. We have a clue to the central meaning of the obscure verb ~~\J""I1 mgd now that the sign \J""I1 (Aa 24) is known to depict the warp being stretched between two uprights. From ~ (A 34) we learn at least something of the quality of the action expressed by the stem ~}~~ bwsi, 'pound', 'build', 'achieve '. The sign ~ (E 32) which determines .;;;~ Ifnd' to be angry' gives to that verb a colouring definitely distinct from the nearly synonymous ~'t:I gltd. Without the sign ~ (M 44) we should not realize the idea of ' sharpness' which enters into the Egyptian concep tion of •preparedness' ~!'M spd. It is interesting, too, to note that in contexts where an object in contemporary use is intended, the determinative employed to designate it is sometimes brought up to date, while in other employments the corresponding sign retains an archaic
appearance, exx. '1 (T 7*) in ~LlX}'1 Ilfftw ' axe' as against -a- (T 7) in ~~X-a- mdft ' hew' ;
~ (T 8*) in j mt} ~ bg'sw ' dagger' as against ~ (T 8) in .~ tpy 'first'; .,.." (T 10) in :-=; Pgt as
against '-=' (T 9), earlier - , in the verb ptl ' stretch '. However, the full value of the study of the hieroglyphs will not emerge until that studyis far more advanced than it is at present. \Ve
are still quite ignorant of the origin of many signs, such as ==fl (Aa 7), ~ (Aa 20), and t (Aa 27).
The modern craving for scientific precision, so contrary to the habit of the Egyptians themselves, has often led in the past to falsification of the actual graphic facts. Thus it has
been the habit of scholars to write brP 'administrate' with i and sbm 'powerful' with f. This particular distinction rests, as it happens, on an erroneous assumption, namely that the signs in question were originally different. But in other cases where there really was a difference, as
between ~ 1mr and l rsw, between the rope ~ (1s) and the bag ~ (sIr), it is astonishing how often even the best scribes are guilty of confusion. Some of these confusions led in course of time to the substitution of one sign for another. Thus 0 (Aa 2) has absorbed quite a number of different signs. Many such confusions arise through hieratic. F or instance, hieratic >-+-< (Aa 8) stands not only for the hieroglyphic sign >-+-<, as in ~ !m 'cease' and H~,~, g1(ilt ' council', but also for"""'" in ,,:-- rd 'district' and for mm in ~ SPit' province '. Assimilations of the kind are apt to pass into hieroglyphic as well, where the reason for them is not obvious until their origin in hieratic is pointed out. Thus.h (M. K. hieratic ~) constantly takes the place of ~ (M. K. hieratic ~) in words from the st~m 1nr, like ~LJ 1nr 'magazine' for ~LJ, a word in which 'JJ itself is a substitution for an earlier sign~. In copying the monuments we must resist the temptation to substitute more correct forms for those actually used. We are not entitled to impose upon the Egyptians our own scholarly preferences. The first column of our sign-list, showing, a~ we have said, Eighteenth Dynasty forms, seeks to define the objects depicted in the earlier prototypes of these. Note that our heads of
439



Sign-list EGYPTIAN GRAMMAR
classification are not, nor could they have been conveniently made, mutually exclusive. Thus
we might have placed 1 0 44 under F • Parts of Mammals' because of the horns which are one of its constituent parts, or else under R, the class containing other religious symbols. Classes S, T, U, and V have proved especially troublesome, and signs allotted to one of them might often have been assigned equally appropriately to another or even to more than one other class. Our second column, which deals with the uses of the signs in the writing of words, sometimes necessarily employs the terms •phonetic', •ideographic', •determinative', and •abbreviation' in ways which are open to criticism. The distinction between phonetic and ideographic uses of signs is not nearly so absolute as might be supposed, see § 42, OBS. It may even happen that a sign is phonetically used in the very name of the object from which it
originated. Thus :l}It Jdw •water-skin' is undoubtedly the word from which ~ (F 30)
originated; nevertheless the phonetic complement ~ and the determinative It are sufficient
evidence that ~ is here the phonetic biliteral sign Jd; the like is true of Ain A.J}~ t/blW •floats'. Elsewhere, as in..b when abbreviation for {ttp •favour' (§ 42, 013S.), or in J7~ st/m •hear' or .Jl} iw •come', the terms ideographic and phonetic seem almost equally suitable. Again, within the domain of C phonetic signs', not all are on the same footing. Save for very
rare variants like .!.~, for ;g, !J1'd' child' and ~~ for ~.!.~ sIJ1' •plan' the sign IlI'I seems
confined to derivatives of the stem !J1' (exx. !J1't •portion ',!Jrt·nt1' •necropolis', !J1'yw •inhabitants '), whereas 4 is freely used for wn even in the words where etymological relationship is out of
the question, exx. h!-' 'ttwn •be young', ~~ wnIJ •clothe '. Such facts as these go to show the impossibility of a hard and fast classification of the uses of signs. Ideographic uses shade off into phonetic, and there are degrees and varieties within the two main groups of sense-sign (ideogram) and sound-sign (phonogram). We have, on occasion, found it convenient to employ the terms •semi-ideographic' and C semi-phonetic " as well as the term C phonetic determinative' explained in § 54. The objection to the term •determinative', which is nevertheless too convenient to discard, was stated in § 23, OBS. We shall also make frequent use of the term
C abbreviation' (§ 55), though this is open to the objection that signs so described, ex. 1 {tip • chief', often represent the original spelling, later amplified by the addition of phonetic and other elements, ex. lL1~i. To sum up, the terminology adopted by us is not intended to bear too technical or too precise an interpretation.
The sign-list which follows is a Middle Egyptian one. With few exceptions it disregards all hieroglyphs that had fallen into disuse by the Eleventh Dynasty, as well as all invented after the reign of l;Iareml)ab. F or this reason, the words that are quoted to illustrate the uses of signs are throughout Middle Egyptian words. It has proved impossible, however, to ignore Old Egyptian completely. We have already alluded to the earlier forms of signs which are sometimes added to the later ones in order to illustrate their original meanings. Again, it is often only some passage in the Pyramid Texts which reveals the reading of an ideogram, and we have sought everywhere to indicate the reasons, or at least one sufficient reason, for the accepted reading of each separate hieroglyph. Moreover, Old Egyptian sometimes gives the
440



LIST OF HIEROGLYPHIC SIGNS Sign-list
explanation why one sign rather than another is used in the writing of a particular word. This applies especially to phonetic signs involving an s-sound, for Old Egyptian rigorously distinguished ~ sand - z. The reason why ~'it SJ 'son', for example, is written with ~ instead of 1:5 is that the earlier reading of the Middle Egyptian word SJ 'son' was ZJ, not SJ. Such facts as these have had to be taken into account. The transliterations used in the following list call for comment in one particular. The use of brackets ( ) is a double one. Either they imply that a consonant has to be understood which is not written, as in To~ WJtJ(y)t 'Edjo', or else that a consonant which is written had disappeared from the pronunciation, as in ~~Q =~ sw(r)i •drink' (§ 279). When one consonant passed into another in the course of the development of the language the conservative Egyptians sometimes retained in the hieroglyphs both the earlier and the later sound-signs. This is what has happened also in t~Jf~ 'what?', transliterated by us fw-ti in § 497 and elsewhere; we might well, however, have written fw-t(r)i, indicating thereby that the earlier form fw-tr had changed into fw-ti. It is unlikely that ambiguity will arise from this twofold employment of brackets. In some cases, as with Jae inf. verbs like ~.A fri, the unwritten consonant i is added in the transliteration without employing brackets.
The explanations given of individual signs have been confined, as a rule, to normal uses, except where, as with ~ B 3, an abnormal use has been found in a particularly important text. It has not, for example, been thought desirable to record wholly exceptional abbreviations, ex. , for ilW. But even with this abstention the variety of employments must often appear astonishing. Sometimes this variety may be due to the fusion of signs originally distinct, as illustrated above. The diversity of employments as determinative sometimes arises from the fact that a sign may stand, not merely for the object it depicts, but also for actions performed therewith, ex. ':::J (U 13) occurs alike in ruJ':::J hb 'plough' (n.) and in ~UJ?,. ~I:jj ski' plough' (vb.); so too with"""" (T 30), """= (Y I), ~ (Y 3). And, of course, the development of the generic determinatives (§ 24) out of signs of much more specific character greatly increased the range of application of the former, ex. the hieroglyph of the striking man ~ came to be employed
where the early O. K. inscriptions particularized by showing a man in the act of sowing 'f or
one in the act of reaping 1!.
The study of the individual hieroglyphs is still in its infancy, though some admirable pioneering work has been done. The principal authorities are :-W. M. FLINDERS PETRIE, Medum, London, 1892; F. LL. GRIFFITH, Bent" Hasan, Part III, London, 1896 i ID., A Collection

The letter and number prefixed to the individual hieroglyphs in the following list are those assigned to them in the Catalogue (Oxford, 1928) of the new fount of type made for the· express purpose of this Grammar. Sometimes, however, the designation will seem to be out of its rightful place, exx. A 59 between A 25, 26, Aa 23, 24 between U 35, 36. This is due either to the sign having been added after the publication of the CataloJ[ue or to our desire to present it in a more appropriate position than in the first edition.

For reasons explained p. 442, top, the following signs have been removed from the place to which they were originally assigned and now stand at some distance from the positions
indicated by the attached letter and number: A 59 f, see after A 25; S 17* r1ml, see after S 22 ;
V 39 I, see after S 34; Aa 4 ~, see after W 10*; Aa 23 'rV. Aa 24 u-u, see after U 35; Aa 32 [, see after T 10. A few hieroglyphs are treated in more than one place: M 44 ~ also before Z 9; N 18 = also after S 26 and X 4; N 33 0 (smaller than 0 D 12) also after Z 8;
o 30 T also reversed 1 after U 12. Minor divergences of position like A 46* after A 47, instead of after A 46, need no further notice than is given to them in the Index above.
A SELECTION OF SIGNS GROUPED ACCORDING TO SHAPE
This list aims at facilitating the finding of particular signs in the Sign-list or the Index thereto. Hieroglyphs the subject of which is immediately recognizable, e.g. animals, boats, most buildings and some pots, have been excluded.
