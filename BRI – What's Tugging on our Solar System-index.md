Something Bigger Than a 9 Planet — Gravity Waves May Be Key!

Astrophysicists around the world, including Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin at Caltech, believe there
is a large force tugging on our solar system. It has led them to speculate that a massive 9th Planet exists
somewhere beyond the known planets.
The Binary Research Institute acknowledges there is large force tugging on the southwest underbelly of
our solar system. We have been pointing this out for the better part of ten years in various papers and
articles. These arguments on the BRI website show the precession observable, the Sun’s apparent lack of
angular momentum relative to the planets, the unusual motion and position of unbound space probes, the
elongated orbits of the minor planets, etc. are best explained if there is a very large object pulling on our
solar system. But we do not think it is a 9th Planet. The force appears to be too great.
Ninth Planet Speculation
The topic first began heating up with the analysis of Sedna. Noticing that it had a very strange orbit,
Mike Brown mentioned it essentially required another mass to explain its position. In 2012 when Scott
Shepard, Chad Trujillo and others added to the conversation with the discovery of Biden (another minor
planet with elongated orbit and an incline similar to Sedna’s) we had multiple smoking guns. It became
more obvious that something large was indeed causing the strange minor planet configurations: elongated
orbits, inclined to the plane, peculiarly similar perihelions.
Looking at all the minor planets together Batygin has stated, “numerous features of the Kuiper Belt...can
be understood if the solar system possesses an additional ninth planet that resides well beyond the orbit
of the known planets.” Given no other evidence than the minor planets pattern it is a logical assumption.
Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything else that could create the observed effect. But given all the other
evidence it would be wise to consider additional, larger possibilities.
A distant brown dwarf, with much greater mass has been hypothesized for years (going back to Muller at
UC Berkley in the 1960s). Such a mass would naturally be larger and easier to spot than a planet. Howev
er, after years of searching no such object has been found.
A More Distant Possibility
There may be another possibility based on the recent discovery of the existence of gravity waves, which
Einstein postulated a hundred years ago. These waves were only confirmed in early 2016 with the LIGO
experiment. Understanding that gravity waves are real and work over a great distance it makes sense to
look at nearby sources of such waves. We should then determine if they are coming from a direction that
could affect the orbital shapes and distribution of the majority of the minor planets.
To better picture how gravity waves might reorder the objects on the edge of our solar system consider
the crude analogy of a distant storm generating waves that erode a local shoreline. As most surfers know
storms that are generated a hemisphere away can easily reform the beaches, ocean bottom, and large sec
tions of a coastline, if the storms are strong enough, and if the oversized waves continue for a long period
of time.
So it may be with gravity waves. Theoretically they are generated by all large binary systems (that



While G waves are still barely understood the Sirius gravitational configuration may seem to act larger
than its three solar masses. It may be that the orbit of Sirius B (the heavy dwarf orbiting Sirius A)
enlarges the wave amplitude or exaggerates the gravity well surrounding Sirius A. Also, it is possible the
perpetual G waves very close to our solar system plane have a more noticeable effect than closer smaller
stars that are far off plane (like Alpha Centauri). The fact is, Sirius is exactly on plane with the incline of
Pluto and appears to have created a resonance. Specifically, Sirius B orbits Sirius A approximately every
50 years, transferring the energy that is causing Pluto to orbit our sun approximately every 250 years. If
you use the precise orbital periods the ratio is an integer, 5.0 to 1. Such would not be the case if Pluto
had a more normalized eccentricity and or inclination. But as one of the minor planets affected by some
extra gravitational force it does not act like the heavier planets closer to the sun. So like a distant storm,
millions of years old, the Sirius system may be perturbing our minor planets into a resonant pattern that
is only explainable by a massive steady force.
contain at least one super dense star), where the two masses are constantly revolving around a common
center of mass. Taylor and Hulse won the Nobel Prize for discoveries along this line in the early 1990s.
But so far we have only built instruments for small experiments on earth to detect the most powerful G
waves. But what if we had an experimental field billions of times larger than the 1 kilometer LIGO set
up? And what if that experiment was running for millions of years? Might this allow us to detect far less
energetic sources of gravity waves? In reality we do have such an experimental field. It is called the solar
system but it takes great powers of observation to notice that something is affecting the outer most minor
planets over a long period of time. This is what Caltech may have discovered.
Considering the direction and incline of the minor planet orbits it would appear that our solar system is
being affected by the Sirius binary system. This system is equivalent to at least three solar masses. It is
also the nearest star system where one of the companions is a white dwarf. Such stars are much denser
than normal matter, meaning a teaspoonful of this dense matter would weigh about two tons. While there
are other stars and star systems that are closer, none are as collectively heavy, and none contain a white
dwarf. Consequently, the Sirius system makes the biggest dent in the local space/time fabric.

While most of the American scientists are now looking for a planet that might be around 10 earth mass
es (the Spanish astronomers are looking for two such objects), at a distance of 250 to 500AU, no one is
considering the possibility of a million earth masses acting at a distance. The reason for the neglect is no
doubt because Sirius at a distance of 8.6 light years is thought to be too far to have any noticeable effect.
But if G waves are real (and it appears they are), and if Sirius B is indeed as dense as believed (and most scientists would agree), then its constant action around Sirius A may be having a far greater affect on
our solar system than previously realized. The Homann’s 20-year experiment, measuring the earth’s daily rotation time relative to the star Sirius, detected changes in the earth’s rotation period when Sirius B passed between earth and Sirius A. If such a phenomenon can noticeably affect the earth’s rotation, then
it is logical to assume that the action of this nearby star system might also affect the entire solar system, especially the minor planets at the edge of the solar system.
Until we have more data here is a picture to ponder. Please note that Sirius is located to our southwest, inclined to the plane at an angle that neatly aligns with the incline of Pluto, and very close to the plane of other recently discovered minor planets.

In summary, while there are likely more minor planets lurking on the outer regions of our system, it would
not surprise us if a large 9th planet is never found. After all, when the analysis of Uranus led to speculation of another planet Neptune was discovered rather quickly. And after realizing that Neptune was acting strangely Pluto was also quickly found. Yet it has now been several years that astronomers have been
looking for a big 9th planet and still nothing has been detected. Perhaps it is time to expand our field of possibilities and look at forces and objects outside our immediate solar system.
