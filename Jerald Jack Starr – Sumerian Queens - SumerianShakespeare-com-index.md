The polos was a domed headdress that was worn by high-ranking women
in Mesopotamia. Many examples of the polos were found in the Akkadian
city of Mari.

This woman is a queen. She wears a kaunakes, a flounced dress with
woolen leaf petals,
the official attire of royals. On her lap she holds a date cluster, a symbol of
royalty. She sits
on a throne that has carved animal legs. It’s the same kind of throne that is
used by
the king on the Standard of Ur. He was a Sumerian king who defeated the
king of Kish
and the Akkadian allies to thus become the new King of Kish, the King of
Kings, the ruler
of both Sumer and Akkad. See the Standard of Ur Narratives.

The woman on the right is the one shown above. Enlarge left, center, right.
All of the statues of women wearing a polos were found in the temple of
Ishtar in Mari.
Ishtar was the Akkadian version of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of war.

There were some variations in the size and shape of a polos.
Some examples of the polos were quite impressive. View the polos from all
angles.
According the Louvre, the polos “probably consisted of a piece of cloth, or
perhaps felt,
covering a light framework to form a tall, voluminous tiara, wider at the
gently rounded top
than at the bottom, and fastened to the head by a horizontal band over the
forehead.
Over the back of the neck and on either side of the face the polos belled
out, giving the
impression of a wig, no doubt covering the true hair discreetly visible
above the forehead.”
A Sumerian queen sometimes wore a ceremonial wig. See the wig and
headdress of
Queen Pu-abi.
The artificial “wig” on the polos is important, for reasons that I will later
explain.

Other examples of the polos were more modest in appearance.
The Mari Mosaic
According to the Louvre Museum, the polos “is also found in shell mosaics
at Mari depicting a ritual scene in which women wearing the polos play a
part. They may be priestesses, or perhaps laywomen who had a particular
role to play in certain ceremonies.”
There are several examples of the polos on the Mari Mosaic:
This mosaic panel was found in the temple of the god Dagan. The details
of the mosaic are best seen in an enlargement (unfortunately, there aren’t
many high-quality images of the mosaic that are freely available on the
Internet).

Everything about the mosaic − the solemn procession, the men with their
hands folded
in prayer, the altar, and the ceremonial bowls and basins − all indicate a
religious context.
In the top register, men walk in a religious procession. The man on the left
has his hands folded in prayer. The man on the right carries two
ceremonial cups.
The bottom registers show women making preparations for the religious
ceremony. Some
of the women wear the polos, while others do not (as seen on the lower left
of the mosaic).
In the middle of the second register, two women set up a fleece-covered
altar mounted on
animal legs. Three posts are set in stone weights. The posts either
supported a canopy or held religious symbols, which are now missing due
to damage.

On the left, a woman carries a small bowl and a basin for use during the
religious ceremony. The bowl was used for pouring libations, or perhaps it
was used for anointing.
The Mari Mosaic was found in pieces on the floor, so the reconstruction is
somewhat speculative. It seems to me that the registers are not in the
correct sequence. It looks like
the men arrive for the ceremonies while the women are still doing the
setup.
Just for the fun of it, I rearranged the registers into the proper sequence:
Top: Women prepare for the ceremony. They sew a garment(?) or a
covering for the altar.

Middle: The altar is set up. Basins and libation bowls are brought in.
Bottom: After the preparations are finished, the men arrive for the
ceremony.
The noblewomen
The Louvre states, “Many of the women wear a high headdress called a
‘polos’ that could identify them as priestesses or ladies of the court.”
I suggest it’s not just the headdress that identifies the women as ladies of
the court.
All of the women who wear a polos also have cylinder seals dangling from
jeweled pendants pinned to their robes. This means the women are
highborn ladies, since common women didn’t have their own cylinder
seals.

Left: A garment pin of gold and lapis lazuli. The pin has a small hole for a
ring that held the pendant, like the pin shown below.
Right: A pendant of gold and lapis lazuli, with a cylinder seal of lapis
lazuli at the end.
Queen Pu-abi also wore her cylinder seals pinned to her robe.
A cylinder seal and the impression it makes when rolled across wet clay. A
cylinder seal
was the official “signature” of the owner. This seal is from the Babylonian
period.
Enlarge the pin.

I further suggest that the women who wear the polos are not just “ladies of
the court".
The religious context of the mosaic, and the fact that all examples of the
polos
were found in temples, indicates that the polos was the headdress of a
priestess.
Specifically, a high-priestess, since a high-priestess was always a highborn
noblewoman.
Ladies of the minor nobility
These women have cylinder seals, but they do not wear a polos. They are
the women
of the minor nobility, the laywomen or "ladies of the court" to which the
Louvre refers.
It looks like they are sewing the fleece covering for the altar. The details
are best seen
in an enlargement. Each woman has one garment pin, but any woman
who wears a polos
has two pins.
The polos: Sumerian or Akkadian?
Many people assumed that the polos was Sumerian. This was a reasonable
assumption because all of the artifacts look like they’re Sumerian. The
problem is, all examples of the polos were found in Mari, which is an
Akkadian city. Not a single polos was found in Sumer.

The Standard of Mari. The Sumerian king is top center. He holds a
battle standard.
In November of 2013, I was researching the page for The Standard of
Mari. This when
I realized that there weren’t any examples of the polos in Sumer. It is also
when
I discovered why so many Sumerian artifacts were found in the temples of
Mari.
The objects were placed there by the Sumerians themselves, after the city
was conquered
by the Sumerian King of Ur, the “King of Kings”, the ruler of both Sumer
and Akkad.
The items are votive offerings that were placed in the Mari temples during
the period of
Sumerian occupation. This includes the Standard of Mari, the Mari
Mosaic, and all of the statutes of women who wear a polos.
Still, it seemed odd that no examples of the polos were found in Sumer.
Why would the
Sumerian polos show up in Akkad, but not in Sumer? I made it my
mission to find one.
I looked everywhere on the Internet, but I couldn’t find a single example.
Over the years,
I frequently searched for a Sumerian polos, but without success.
Late last year, I finally found one.
Or so I thought.

A royal banquet
This plaque is from the Sumerian city of Girsu. The Sumerian context is
unmistakable.
The plaque shows a banquet scene. The servants bring food and drink. See
an enlargement of some of the details.
See the picture magnified x2 and x3.
I posted this picture as an example of a Sumerian woman wearing a polos.
After that,

I forgot about it for a while.
A few days ago, I was idly looking at the banquet scene on the plaque.
At the banquet, a Sumerian king and queen are attended by their servants.
We know they are a king and queen, and not just a lord and lady, because
both of them hold a date cluster, the symbol of royalty.
At first I assumed the queen was wearing a polos to show that she is a
priestess. Then
I wondered, why would the queen wear her priestess hat at the dinner
table? (as it were).
I took another look at the hat.
Then I realized something: It looks like a polos, but it isn’t. The woman is
not wearing
a polos, the headdress of a priestess. She is wearing a crown.
The crown of a Sumerian queen

There are no known images of a Sumerian queen wearing a crown, but I
suggest the crown looked just like this.
Notice her hairdo beneath the crown. It is not an artificial wig, like on a
polos.
It is a natural hairstyle, with waves and curls, like the hair of the servant in
front of her.
On a polos, the hair of the “wig” is smooth and solid.

Polos, side view. There are no striations on the side of the wig to make it
look like hair.
The woman’s real hair is shown beneath her hat.
What looks like a bun of hair beneath the polos is actually part of the hat:

The hair in the drawing doesn’t appear on the original inlay. (Note: Her
cylinder seal
is missing in the drawing.)
The polos: the headdress of a Sumerian queen in her role as a
high-priestess

The crown is smaller than a polos and the hair is worn loose beneath it.
The polos is larger and it has a built-in wig.
Although a crown and a polos are two different types of headwear, they are
very similar.
I therefore suggest that the polos was a variation of the crown.
The crown was the secular, “everyday” headdress of the queen. Her crown
was a variation
of the "shepherd crown", the crown of a Sumerian king, as explained on a
separate page.
In other words, the polos was a variation of the queen's crown, which in
turn was a variation
of the king's crown.
The polos wasn't very practical. It was overly large, and in many cases it
covered the ears. Imagine a queen trying to go about her daily business
while wearing a bulky polos.
All examples of the polos were found in temples, indicating the polos was
only worn during
religious occasions. It was worn by a Sumerian queen during the
performance of her duties
as a high-priestess.
I suggest the polos was worn exclusively by a queen, and not just any lady
of the court.

A previously mentioned, this woman is a queen. She sits on a throne, she
wears the
royal kaunakes (the robe of woolen leaf petals), and she holds a date
cluster. She also
wears a polos. This proves the polos was the headdress of a queen, and
only a queen,
because a queen would not wear the same headdress as a lesser mortal,
and because
no other woman was allowed to wear the same headdress as a queen.
It's not as if some of the women who wear a polos are queens, and some of
them are not. Either all of them are queens, or none of them are.
Ereš (pronounced "eresh") meaning "queen"
Every woman a queen
I suggest that all the women who wear a polos are queens. Every single
one of them.
Each statue was personally placed in the temple of Ishtar as a votive
offering to the goddess by a reigning queen.

The queens were contemporaries. They knew each other. They were
friends (and rivals).
Each statue represents a living queen.
Two Sumerian queens. Their hands are folded is ceaseless prayer to the
goddess.
Notice that many of the women who wear a polos also wear the royal
kaunakes (right),
but It doesn’t matter if some of the women don’t wear a kaunakes, they are
still queens.
The kaunakes was “formal attire”. It was only used for ceremonial
occasions, it wasn’t
worn every day.
That is why none of the women on the Mari Mosaic wear the kaunakes.
They are merely
setting up for the religious services, the rituals have not yet started. The
women will later
wear their formal kaunakes during the solemn ceremonies.

Four of the six Sumerian queens on the Mari Mosaic
Notice that there are a lot of women on the mosaic who wear the polos.
Not counting the two damaged figures next to the altar, there is a total of
six women
on the Mari Mosaic who wear a polos.
Can they all be queens?
Generally, when you see a queen, you see only one. Any other women in
Sumerian Queens about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/1023201.html
22 of 28 8/18/2020, 5:11 PM



attendance are usually just her ladies-in-waiting, or perhaps they are
women of the lesser nobility.
To have six queens in a single picture is exceedingly rare (I personally
don’t know of any).
However, there’s a very good reason why so many queens appear on the
Mari Mosaic.
Remember, the Sumerian artifacts were placed in the temples of Mari
when the city was
occupied by the Sumerian King of Kings and his Sumerian allies. Many
Sumerian kings
from neighboring city-states were his allies in his military campaign
against the Akkadians
(see the Standard of Ur Narratives). After the war, the allied kings and
their dependents
(their male relatives, officials, retainers, etc.) were appointed as the
administrators of the
newly conquered territories. These dependents included their wives.
Although the women
did not have government positions, they formed the new Sumerian royal
courts in the cities
of Akkad. They were also installed as the new high-priestesses in many
Akkadian temples, since the Sumerians and the Akkadians practiced the
same religion. So, at this time
in history, there were plenty of Sumerian queens in Mari and in other
Akkadian cities.
The Mari Mosaic. The royal standard of a Sumerian queen?

A king had his own royal standard, so why shouldn’t a queen? It’s entirely
possible that
the Mari Mosaic was the royal standard of a queen. Unfortunately, most of
the plaque is
missing due to damage. Whether or not it was a standard depends on the
missing parts
of the narrative. If the missing portions were the same as the other parts
(i.e., if they only
showed the preparations for the ceremonies) then the mosaic is probably
just a
commemorative plaque with a religious theme.
On the other hand...
Many of the most important parts of the narrative are missing due to
damage.
For instance:
This small fragment is all by itself in the lower right corner of the panel. It
is shown with
increasing magnification (and some loss of image quality). It shows a
polos being carried
(notice the hand), or more likely, the polos is being placed on someone’s
head. I suggest
the Mari Mosaic portrays the investiture of a new high-priestess for the
temple of Dagan.
In this case, the mosaic may be the royal standard of a queen.
The new high-priestess
It’s easy to pick out the new high-priestess among the six queens that are
portrayed
on the Mari Mosaic.

She’s the one who is drawn larger than everybody else to show her greater
importance,
and she's the one with the tallest polos.
I believe the queen appeared in all three registers of the panel, but this is
the only image
that survived the damage.
Even while kneeling she is the tallest person on the Mari Mosaic.
She is the newly appointed Sumerian high-priestess of the temple of
Dagan in Mari.

I believe this is the exact same woman. She is represented in the temple of
Ishtar, just like
all the other Sumerian queens. She sits on her throne in all her royal
regalia. She wears the kaunakes skirt and a matching ceremonial shawl
draped over her polos. Her new polos is
the one being carried on the Mari Mosaic. I suggest her ceremonial shawl
is the same cloth that is being sewn by the ladies in the lower register of
the mosaic. Next, the shawl is consecrated on the altar in the middle
register. Then in the top register, in an image that is now missing due to
damage, she wears the ceremonial shawl draped over her polos while
she sits on her throne, exactly as shown above. It portrays her investiture
as the new
high-priestess for the temple of Dagan in Mari.
One more thing:
If the Sumerian King of Ur is the “King of Kings” then his wife must be...

The Sumerian “Queen of Queens”
The King of Kings and the Queen of Queens.
I believe this woman is the wife of the king on the Standard of Ur (whom I
also believe is the same king as the one on the Standard of Mari).
One queen in the temple of Ishtar has to be the wife of the Sumerian king
who conquered
Mari and the other Akkadian cities. After all, he's the reason why the
Sumerian queens
were in the Mari temples to begin with.
So of course his wife is present in the temple of Ishtar, along with all the
other queens.
She was probably the high-priestess of the temple. Ishtar was a goddess
most favored
by the king of Ur, the king of war.
This woman is the most obvious choice for the wife of the Sumerian king.
They both wear

the royal kaunakes. They both sit on the same kind of throne.
He was the king of Ur who conquered all of Sumer and Akkad to become
the King of Kings.
His queen was a formidable person in her own right. She was the high
priestess of Ishtar.
She ran the royal court of the king, and her own court as well. She ruled
over all the other
queens of Sumer and Akkad.
She was the most powerful and influential woman in all of Mesopotamia.
She was the ultimate Queen of Queens.
