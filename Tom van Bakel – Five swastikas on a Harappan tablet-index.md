Five swastikas on a Harappan tablet
H-182 b
The unique features of this imprint of a tablet from Harappa are of course the five swastikas placed in a row. To my knowledge there is no other stamp or tablet that looks like this one.
Many signs on the Indus stamps can more or less be understood by means of Rigveda verses, but for these five swastikas we really need to consult the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25. In these Khandas we read that during the pregnancy period Soma protects the fetus five times. It will be clear that this activity is suggested by these five swastikas, as in the Ancient Indus Valley Civilization swastikas are one of the symbols for this Soma drug.
But this imprint depicts a second message: the three signs on the right suggest that the storm gods Indra an Vâyu make Aditi (Heaven and Earth) pregnant. We can read such a thing in Khanda 19:
Khanda 19 5. Or, 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vâyu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb, N.N.!'
So, the above tablet tells us that Indra, Vâyu (the two vertical lines) and Adity (the two overlapping wombs) engender a child and the five swastikas suggest that during the pregnancy period the fetus is protected by means of Soma.
Tarakai Qila-3
This Indus stamp, found in Tarakai Qila, is engraved with five ring signs with a dot in the middle. These rings and dots symbolize Soma drops (see below).
o The stamp itself has the shape of an X-sign that suggests the conception, so the beginning of pregnancy, (see below). o But the ring signs with their dots suggest the five times a Soma drug was used during the pregnancy period, just to protect the fetus.



M 312
The point was that I could only understand the meaning of the five swastikas and the five rings with dots inside after studying this zebu fighting against five opponents. It is customary to assume that a game is being played here, that these men are jumping the bull, as still happens here and there, but I think, however, that there is a fight going on: as far as I am concerned, the five men have unnatural postures by the thrown away by the zebu and they fall to the ground turned upside down being completely defeated.
In the Ancient Indus Valley this zebu embodies Soma, and from the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda we can see that this is a drink or a prepared amount of food that can drive away opponents, just to protect the fetus.

This tablet shows a similar scene: with its horns a zebu throws human figures into the air. But this stamp also has an arrow carved in front of the cow and this weapon connects the whole scene to Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25: In these Khandas people do not jump over zebus but Rhaksas, maladies etc. are driven away by means of Soma, again, embodied by the zebu:
Rigveda 10-163
1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin, Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away.

H-1904 A
To understand some simple stamps I have to show you two important signs, the first one is this ring with a little hole inside: this ring and hole symbolize a Soma drop, as it is mentioned in the Rigveda hymns:
Rig Veda 9-68 Soma Pavamana
The drops of Soma juice like cows who yield their milk have flowed forth, rich in meath, unto the Shining One,
See: (29) Richly decorated Soma jars from the Indus Valley Civilisation | Tom van Bakel - Academia.edu
The second one is this X sign:
pap [RELATION] (86x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pap 'first and foremost, pre-eminent; father; male, virile; brother' Akk. abu; ahu; ašarēdu; zikaru
h ttp://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
As you see, ixn ancient Sumer, it was a sign that had the following meanings: ‘first and foremost, pre-eminent; father; male, virile; brother'. However on ANE cylinder seals it indicates the mating act.
In the Indus Valley Civilization it has the same meaning. When we know this, the meaning of the next Harappan stamp suddenly becomes clear:
H-638
o In the first place the X-sign in this stamp symbolizes 'male’ and ‘virile’ and it suggests the conception of a child, so the beginning of pregnancy. o There are also four rings and five holes symbolizing the five times that Soma was used during the period of pregnancy.
So, the X-sign indicate the beginning of pregnancy and five Soma symbols suggest the protection during the whole pregnancy period.



Tarakai Qila
This Indus stamp, found in Tarakai Qila, is engraved with five signs. Four of them are made of two concentric rings and by all of them there is a hole in the middle. These rings and holes symbolize Soma drops. And thus:
o The X-shaped stamp symbolizes 'male' and ‘fertility’ suggesting the conception of a child, so the beginning of pregnancy. o The five rings with dots inside symbolize the five times that Soma was used during the period of pregnancy to protect the fetus.
https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces71507.html
Now I have to show you these Sumerian diamond signs. They have been known as so-called ‘token’. As you see they have different meanings, but when linked to a cross they will surely have meant ‘womb’.
H-1535 A
On this stamp you see a special X-sign as it is shaped like a star. When we place the stamp as shown, the stamp itself forms a diamond, symbolizing a womb. Now we see something wonderful happening:
o The X-sign within the diamond suggests ‘male fertility’, and united with this diamond it indicates the conception of a child. o The diamond by itself suggests the delivery of this child. o Both symbols thus encompass the whole pregnancy period. o Then the five ring figures, symbolizing Soma drops, suggest that during this pregnancy the fetus is protected five times.



M-288
Before we go on I have to show you three other signs. I start with this one: this stamp depicts ‘a phallus with two testicles’, which of course suggests the conceiving of a child.
Number 1
And in the Indus Valley Civilization a swastika symbolized Soma: in the middle of this plate this symbol was painted indicating that this plate was used to eat or of offer Soma.
See: (11) Swastikas found in Samarra have a different meaning than the ones found in the Indus Valley | Tom van Bakel - Academia.edu
Number 2
This is an imprint of a Sumerian Cylinder Seal. Here we see how an X-sign was worked out in Sumer: it consists of four elongated leaves (?). Since it is made up of four leaves, the Xsign is linked to the number four and therefore this number symbolizes the act of mating.



M-288 H-165
On the left we see the phallus with two testicles and on the right we see a remarkable stamp. The figure as a whole obviously resembles the phallus with two testicles, but this figure is made up of four squares, each of which has a swastika-like sign cut out.
o These four squares are of course linked to number four which symbolizes the conceiving. o And the four swastika-like figures within this stamp suggest that Soma is a ‘fertile
power’, capable of begetting offspring.
Rigveda 9-9 Soma Pavamana 9 Give, Pavamana, high renown, give kine and steeds and hero sons: Win for us wisdom, win the light.
Number 3
Here is another stamp that is of course related to the Sumerian X-sign.
o This X-sign indicates the conception. o The symbolic number for this conception is four. o This means that these four Soma drops suggest that Soma causes this conception, it is the creating power and it is able to beget hero sons:
Rigveda 9-74 Soma Pavamana
5 The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with sap for man the skin which Gods enjoy.
Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain children and progeny.



H-585
A zebu, embodying Soma, is engraved in this seal and this four-legged friend appears to be able to give progeny:
Rigveda 9-59 Soma Pavamana
1. Flow onward, Soma, winning kine, and steeds, and all that gives delight: Bring hither wealth with progeny.
However, the trident also shows that the zebu is a warrior: it marks the beginning of pregnancy. So Soma is a fertile god who can give progeny and it is a drug that protects the engendered fetus.
M-318 a
Again the zebu and signs on this stamp suggest that Soma gives food and offspring:
Rigveda 9-23 Soma Pavamana .
1. Swift Soma drops have been effused in streams of meath, the gladdening drink, For sacred lore of every kind. 2 Hither to newer. resting-place the ancient Living Ones are come. They made the Sun that he might shine. 3 O Pavamana, bring to us the unsacrificing foeman's wealth, And give us food with progeny.
And the trident suggests that Soma protects this offspring during pregnancy.



Number 4
I have edited the tablet or stamp on the left, creating the fictitious 'tablet' on the right. This tablet or stamp itself has a cross shape and therefore symbolizes 'male fertility', or: 'the ability to conceive a child'.
o But in this tablet are five larger rings with a smaller ring inside. These double rings suggest the five times Soma protects the fetus during pregnancy. o Also engraved in this tablet or seal are four smaller rings suggesting that Soma is the begetting god. o And thus Soma has two activities on this tablet or seal: it begets a child and it protects that same child during the whole pregnancy period.
M-352 A
On this stamp are five larger rings with holes in them. These larger rings suggest the five times Soma protects the fetus during pregnancy. In this tablet or stamp are also engraved four dots that suggest that Soma is the creating god. On this stamp Soma therefore has two activities: it creates a child and it protects that same child during pregnancy.
Two crosses are carved on this stamp, one may symbolize the two different activities of Soma.



H-128 a
Nine Soma symbols are cut out on this stamp. It is obvious to assume that here four of the nine Soma signs indicate that Soma fathers a child and that the other five Soma signs indicate that Soma protects this child during pregnancy.
Number 5
Six Soma drops are applied to this stamp. In Kanda 21 we read that six oblations were offered to Agni:
Khanda 21
1. In the fourth month the Garbharakshana (i.e. the ceremony for the protection of the embryo), 2. Sacrificing six oblations from a mess of cooked food with (the six verses of the hymn),
Rigveda 10-162 Agni
1. May Agni, yielding to our prayer, the Raksas-slayer, drive away The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb.
So, number six can be linked Agni but also with his wife Svaha because she took the form of the wives of Saptarishis six times and united herself six times with the god of fire. So Agni and Svaha unite with each other and during the pregnancy period Soma protects the fetus five times, suggested by the five Soma drops that form the rim.



We have just looked at the front of this stamp, but now we will study the four sides, which also have rings with balls on them.
M-352 d
To understand what these three Soma drops could mean, we must turn again to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25. And here we see that after the child is born food must be offered to the Tithi the three constellations with their presiding deities:
Khanda 25
4 4. Let (the father) cook a mess of food in that same fire that has been kept from her confinement,
5. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities. 6. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede (the corresponding Nakshatra).
In this case the (presiding) deity of these three constellations will have been the god of Soma.



In Khanda 19 the creator gods Agni, Indra and Vâyu are mentioned:
5. Or, 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vâyu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb, N.N.!'
I suppose either Soma has taken their place or all three have drunk Soma, making this drink in effect the begetting power.
Two Soma signs will symbolize the offerings bestowed on Tithi of the child's birth and to three constellations with their presiding deities:
Khanda 25 And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities.
Khanda 25 6. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede (the corresponding Nakshatra).
But in this situation the oblations were made for the god of Soma.
The two other Soma signs will symbolize the sacrifices offered to Soma, replacing Agni, Indra and Vâyu.
On this special stamp we see that Soma performs various actions. These actions are suggested by the number:
o The four Soma drops suggest the act of begetting. o The five drops suggest the protection that Soma gives during the pregnancy period. o The first series of three drops suggest that Soma takes the place of Agni, Indra and Vâyu. o The first series of two drops are the offerings for Soma replacing Agni, Indra and Vâyu. o The second series of three drops suggest that Soma takes the place of the three gods of the birth constellations. o The second series of two drops are the offerings to Soma replacing the gods of the birth constellations.



Here we see two three-sided tablets next to each other on which three times three Soma symbols are engraved. We can now say the following about this:
o In total, nine Soma symbols are depicted on each tablet. o Four of these suggest the act of begetting. o The five others suggest the protection that Soma gives during pregnancy. o The first series of three drops suggest that Soma takes the place of Agni, Indra and Vâyu. o The second series of three drops could be the food offerings to the gods and constellations. o The third set of three drops could be Soma taking the place of the three gods of the birth constellations.
On these two tablets, Soma fulfills everything, as more or less described in the following Rigveda verses:
Rigveda 9-61 Soma Pavamana 6 O Soma, being purified, bring us from all sides,-for thou canst,Riches and food with hero sons.
15 Soma, pour blessings on our kine, pour forth the food that streams with milk Increase the sea that merits laud.
20 Killing the foeman and his hate, and winning booty every day, Gainer art thou of steeds and kine.
23 Soma who rainest gifts, may we win riches with our hero sons: Strengthen, as thou art cleansed, our hymns.
25 Chasing our foemen, driving off the godless, Soma flowcth on, Going to Indra's special place. 26 O Pavamana, hither bring great riches, and destroy our foes: O Indu, grant heroic fame.
28 Indu, flow on, a mighty juice; glorify us among the folk: Drive all our enemies away.



H-1702
Here we see two three-sided tablets next to each other on which three times three Soma symbols are engraved. We can now say the following about this:
o The first series of three drops suggest that Soma takes the place of Agni, Indra and Vâyu. o The second series of three drops could be the offerings to the gods and constellations. o The third set of three drops could be Soma taking the place of the three gods of the birth constellations.
o
So, the three Soma drops at the top suggest the beginning of pregnancy and the three drops below suggest the end of pregnancy. The two drops in the middle represent the Soma oblations that are offered to the Soma god.
Nausharo-3
Seven rings containing smaller concentric rings have been applied to this round stamp, all of which symbolize Soma drops. The seven can be linked to the Pleiades, and the god of this small constellation is Agni. The seven Soma drops by themselves may suggest that Soma in Pleiades is the creator god, but it may just as well suggest Agni, filled with Soma, is the creator god, for Agni too is shown to be drinking Soma:
Rigveda 1-14 Visvedevas
1 To drink the Soma, Agni, come, to our service and our songs. With all these Gods; and worship them.



Number 6
There are similarities between the above Indus stamps and some cylinder seals from the Diyala Region, Khafaje and West Iran. On this imprint of a cylinder seal from the Diyala Region we can recognize the phalluses signs with testicles and lots of Soma drops.
Number 8
On this imprint of Kassite cylinder seals from Western Iran, cross marks are x-signs and flower-like symbols formed from Soma spheres.
