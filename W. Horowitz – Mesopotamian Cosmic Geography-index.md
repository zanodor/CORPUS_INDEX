Foreword
Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography represents the main part of my first decade of study as an assyriologist. The book began its life as a Ph.D. thesis of the same name under the supervision of Professor W G. Lambert of the Universityof Birmingham. After completion of the Ph.D. thesis in 1986, I continued to collect materials relevant to the study of Mesopotamian views of cosmography with the intention of revising the thesis as a book in the early 1990s. The book Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography presents this revised, more mature examination of the topic.

Acknowledgments
First and foremost I would like to thank Professor W. G. Lambert of The University of Birmingham. Professor Lambert both supervised the original 1986 Ph.D. thesis "Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography" and then graciously reread the manuscript of the book. His wise and learned criticisms were invaluable in the preparation of the book. I would also like to thank my colleagues at The Hebrew University, Professors Aaron Shaffer and Hayim Tadmor, and my first teachers of Akkadian and Sumerian, Dr. Martha Morrison and Professors Anne Kilmer and Wolfgang Heimpel, for their support during the various stages of my career. In addition, a special word of thanks is due to Professor Tsvi Abusch, who assisted in the preparation of the original PhD. thesis. I would also like to thank the Trustees of The British Museum for permission to publish materials included in the book, and colleagues at The Western Asiatic Department of the British Museum, Das Vorderasiatische Museum, and The University Museum for their hospitality during study visits to London, Berlin, and Philadelphia, respectively. In addition, I would like to thank The American Friends of Hebrew University, The Lady Davis Foundation, and The Israel Academy of Sciences for their financial support during the period of the preparation of the manuscript. Finally, special thanks are due to my parents Dawn and Paul for their continued encouragement and support (financial and otherwise); my wife Lilach, for her selfless help over the past decade; Lilach's parents, Professor Chaim and Miriam Brandwein; and of course my children Lisa, Mikhael, Liam, and Gilbe for their unseen contributions to the preparation of this book.

Introduction
This study collects and presents the available evidence in Sumerian and Akkadian texts for Mesopotamian ideas of the physical structure of the universe and its constituent parts (Heaven, Earth, Apsu [the subterranean waters], Underworld). All texts from all periods and genres are considered, from the earliest phases of cuneiform writing through the late period. What emerges from this study is a Mesopotamian view of the universe that is both cohesive on the one hand, and discordant and deficient on the other. In many respects, ancient Mesopotamian understandings of the universe remained remarkably constant over the 2,500 years or so from the earliest evidence for cosmography in literary materials through the end of cuneiform writing. Throughout this time, the extant texts demonstrate that Sumerians and Akkadians understood the universe as consisting of superimposed levels separated by open space. From above to below, the levels were: a region of heaven above the sky where the gods of heaven dwelled, the starry sky, the earth's surface, the subterranean waters of the Apsu, and finally the underworld of the dead:

Introduction XUI
This universe, according to both Sumerian and Akkadian traditions, was built by the gods in earliest times and held together by cosmic bonds. It is this conception of the physical universe that underlies, for example, early cosmological traditions in literary works from the middle of the third millennium, the cosmography of the Babylonian national epic Enuma Elish from the late second millennium, and traditions preserved in late archives such as that of Hellenistic Uruk. Similarly, important Mesopotamian cosmographical ideas, such as the existence of an unseen region of the gods above the sky, or the tradition of the "Four Regions of the World" (an. u b.da.limm u. ba = kibrat arbaJi, are present in materials before the end of the third millennium, and these traditions live onward through the end of cuneiform writing. Nonetheless, the available evidence does document change in Mesopotamian conceptions of the universe. Mesopotamian understandings of the geography of the sky evolved over time as Mesopotamian astronomy improved, and Akkadian texts from the end of the second millennium onward divide the region of heaven above the sky into two parts. Anu, the king of heaven, dwells in the higher of the two, which is often called "The Heaven of Anu." . Yet, despite the continuity of tradition between the earliest and latest documents, one does find disagreement between texts from different periods, of different genres, and even among texts from the same period and genre. For example, a number of texts seem to ignore the existence of the waters of the Apsu between the earth's surface and the underworld, and one text (KAR 307) even preserves an apparent contradiction whereby Igigi-gods are placed in a heaven belonging to Anu, the upper of three heavens in one line, and then in an intermediate level of heaven between Anu's heaven and the sky in the very next line. Finally, the available evidence leaves a number of problems completely unsolved. For example, no surviving text presents clear evidence for the bounds of the physical universe or explains what might be found beyond the limits of the universe. Such problems are endemic to this study, since no Single surviving ancient Mesopotamian source or set of sources presents a comprehensive view of the physical universe. This investigation attempts to glean evidence from the widest possible variety of surviving sources in order to present as clear a picture as possible of Mesopotamian views of the universe. At the same time, however, it must be recognized that this approach poses certain dangers, not the least of which are our distance in time and space from the ancient writers, as well as the vagaries of archaeological discovery. For example, the most complete description of the earth's surface is found in The Babylonian Map of the World, which is known from but a Single manuscript, and ancient Mesopotamian authors do not distinguish between cosmographic ideas drawn from direct observation of the physical world (for example, the movement of stars in the sky) and those not derived from direct observation (for example, the geography of the Heaven of Anu above the sky or the fantastic regions visited by Gilgamesh in Gilg. IX-X). The current evidence simply does not allow us to know, for instance, if ancient readers of



xiv Introduction
Gilgamesh really believed that they too could have visited UtnapiStim by sailing across the cosmic sea and "the waters of death;' or if a few, many, most, or all ancient readers understood the topographical material in Gilg. IX-X in metaphysical or mystical terms. Thus, herein I do not attempt to assess the plausibility of ancient cosmographic traditions, to harmonize conflicting traditions, or to flesh out surviving materials by speculation or through comparison with materials from other cultures. Rather, as noted above, the aim of the study is to to collect and present the available evidence in Sumerian and Akkadian texts for Mesopotamian ideas of the physical structure of the universe and its constituent parts. As such, this study, despite its use of a wide variety of materials from the entire history of cuneiform civilization, is limited in scope and may be thought of as a data-base that may be used to facilitate future explorations in the field of Mesopotamian cosmography. Mesopotamia Cosmic Geography is divided into two parts. The first part (chapters 1-9) presents studies of the main sources for Sumerian and Akkadian views of the physical universe. Included here is a study of lists of heavens and earths in KAR 307; editions of The Babylonian Map of the World and The Sargon Geography; traditions concerning voyages to heaven in the Akkadian epics Etana, Adapa, and Nergal and Ereskigal; cosmography in Sumerian and Akkadian accounts of creation; the geography of the sky in astronomical texts; an edition of a late fragment of what may be an ancient Mesopotamian drawing of a compass-card or sundial; and finally an evaluation of a possible tradition of seven heavens and seven earths in Sumerian language incantations. Part II presents general studies of Sumerian and Akkadian names for heaven and earth (chapters 10, 12), and examines the geographies of the two halves of the universe (chapters 11, 13). Here it is noted that the Sumerian and Akkadian lexica contain no single word that conveys our notion of cosmos or universe. Instead, general words or phrases for totality are used such as Akkadian kissatu, kullatu, or kissat kal gimrati 'the entirety of all of everything' (Ee IV 14). More often both Sumerian and Akkadian materials speak of the entire universe in terms of its two constituent halves, 'Heaven and Earth'. Most common are Sumerian an.ki and the Akkadian equivalent samu u er$etum, but other more poetic pairs are also attested including Sumerian an -u r a sand g i s1a m, and Akkadian samamfl u qaqqaru, and the pairs samamfl - esmabbu, andurunna - er$etu, elatu - saplatu, asru - kigallu, ermi dani - ganzer, and burflmfl-matatu.1 In the studies of the geographies of heaven and earth in Part II, materials are drawn from the entire Sumero-Akkadian corpus, including texts previously examined in Part I. Thus, Part II helps place the materials presented in Part I in a broader context. The book concludes with handcopies and . photographs of ancient texts, and indexes.
I A list of such pairs may be found in the index sub Heaven - Earth.

Chapter 1
The Levels of the Universe
KAR 307 30-38 and AO 8196 iv 20-22
Two short passages, KAR 307 30-38 (for a new copy, see plate 1)1 and AO 8196 iv 20-22 (AfO 19 taf. 33), list the levels of the universe, with short descriptions of each level. KAR 307, a religious explanatory text in Neo-Assyrian script from Assur, lists three sets of heavens and three earths, while AO 8196, a late astrological-astronomical tablet, lists the three heavens but does not list the earths. AO 8196 iv 20-22 is nearly identical to the opening portions of KAR 307 30,31, and 33. In both texts, the levels of the universe are listed in descending order beginning with the highest heavens.

The Date of the Lists
Although the tablets KAR 307 and AO 8196 both date to the first millennium, the lists of cosmic regions in KAR 307 30-38 and AO 8196 iv 20-22, in their present form, may be as old as the Kassite period. The lists as preserved cannot have been written earlier than this time, because KAR 307 places the 19i9i-gods in the heavens and the Anunnaki-gods in the underworld. This divi
The Tablets 5
sion of the Igigi and Anunnaki is not known before Kassite times.s Nevertheless, the tradition of three heavens and earths could be older.
The Tablets
KAR 307 (VAT 8917)4
KAR 307 is one of a small number of first-millennium mystical-religious compilations.5 The tablet preserves 63 lines of text divided into six sections by horizontal rulings, with three sections on the obverse and three on the reverse. The section of the tablet describing the levels of the universe (obv. 30-38) occupies the final section of the obverse. No horizontal ruling follows, so the first section of the reverse (rev. 1-10) may belong to the same section as the list of cosmic regions. The colophon notes that KAR 307 conveys privileged information. Its first line describes the tablet as a piristi ilani rabUti 'secret of the Great Gods' and admonishes the reader "let the knowing reveal it only to the knowing, do not let the unknowing view it, it is a taboo (ikkibu) of the Great Gods."6 This secret information consists mainly of identifications and explanations. Everyday and religious articles, religious practices, parts of the universe, and astronomical phenomena are listed and their religious, mystical, or cultic significance explained. For instance, the first 18 lines of the text equate everyday items such as drums, fish, figs, and oil with parts of a divine statue or god's body; lines 19-21 identify !Star of Nineveh as Tiamat and explain that she was the wet-nurse (museniqtum) of Bel; and rev. 4 states that the "disk"6f the Sun is 60 leagues and that of the Moon is 40 leagues. 7 This line is repeated verbatim in ACh !Star 28: 42, demonstrating that KAR 307, like AO 8196, provides some astrological information.
3 For the Igigi as gods of heaven, see Oppenheim, Man and Nature 657 n. 81. For the Anunnaki as gods of the underworld, see B. Kienast in AS 16 156-58 and A Tsukimoto, AOAT 216184-200. The earliest known example of this distinction is found in the Sumerian myth preserved on a statue of the Kassite king Kurigalzu (see pp. 143-44). For this distinction in a Middle Babylonian kudurru, see W Sommerfeld, UF 16303 v 9-15. 4 A transliteration and translation of KAR 307 appears in SAA 3 99-102. Editions of various sections of KAR 307 also appear in A Livingstone, Mystical and Mythological Explanatory Works. A now outdated edition of the tablet is offered by E. Ebeling in TuL

6 The Levels oj the Universe
Much of the information revealed by KAR 307 relates to the battles of Marduk and Ninurta against their enemies Tiamat, Kingu, Enmdarra, and the Anzu-bird that are known from literary texts such as Enuma Elish, The MoonGod and the Demons (= Utukku Lemnutu 16), The Judgment oj EnmeSarra (T. G. Pinches, PSBA 30 53-62, 77-83), The Anzu-Myth, Lugale, and Angimdimma. KAR 307 rev. 3, for instance, notes that Tiamat has four eyes and explains that her right eyes form the sources of the Tigris and her left eyes form the sources of the Euphrates. In Ee V 55, Marduk opens the sources of the two rivers in the eyes of Tiamat. Ee I 97-98 states that Marduk himself was endowed with four eyes and four ears. Likewise, KAR 307 24-27 alludes to Ninurta's victory over the Anzu-bird, which was celebrated in the various recensions of the Anzu-Myth. Often, information in KAR 307 correlates events in the aforementioned texts with ritual practice. For instance, KAR 307 rev. 20-25 apparently connects a ritual involving the king with materials similar to Angimdimma and Lugale. In the ritual, the king, who sits on a throne, is carried out of Ekur and then returned to Ekur. Cedar is then burned before him. The mystical explanation of the ceremony identifies the king as Ninurta, who avenged his fathers. In Lugale, Ninurta leaves the Ekur to fight enemies on behalf of his fathers and then returns triumphantly to Ekur. Similarly, KAR 307 rev. 19 equates the ritual throwing of a dove with the splitting of Tiamat. Thus the ritual act in KAR 307 is explained in terms of Ee IV 137-38, where Marduk splits Tiamat in half before constructing the heavens. Such passages correlating ritual practice and mythological events are typical of the genre of mystical-religious works that includes KAR 307, but it is not clear if these passages served as rough scripts for cultic reenactments of mythological events or if the association between myth and ritual occurred on a more mystical plain. Other sections of KAR 307 present religious traditions that have not been preserved elsewhere. KAR 307 rev. 11-16, for example, identifies the ghosts of Enlil, Anu, the Daughters of Anu, and Tiamat as animals. In these lines, the ghost of Enlil is a donkey; the ghost of Anu is a wolf; the ghosts of the Daughters of Anu are gazelles; and the ghost of Tiamat is a camel with shorn horns, bound feet, and a cut-off tail. These traditions may be based on religious ceremonies where such animals were understood to represent the aforementioned gods.8 However, no such ritual application is obvious for the list of the levels of the universe in KAR 307 30-38. Therefore, it seems probable that this list was included in KAR 307 because of the close affinities between the list and materials in Enuma Elish. In both Enuma Elish and KAR 307 30-38, MarduklBel settles Ea in the Apsu, mankind on the earth's surface, and groups of gods in heaven and earth. KAR 307 33, like Ee V 1-8, states that Marduk arranged the stars in heaven.
8 Note, for example, KAR 307 rev. 17-18, where cattle and sheep that are slaugh
tered in a ritual represent Kingu and his seven sons, and Racc 26: 6, where the seven
sons of Enmesarra are represented by seven heaps of flour (zidubdubbu). However, for
the ghost of Anu as a wolf compare VR 46 2: mUlur. bar.ra = da-nu, 'The Wolf-Star is Anu'.
The Tablets 7
AO 8196 (AJO 19 pls. 31-34)
AO 8196 presents a late-Babylonian collection of astronomical, astrological, and religious information. The tablet is poorly preserved. When complete, AO 8196 presented six columns, with three columns on each side. The entire first and sixth columns, most of the second and fifth columns, and portions of columns three and four are missing. The surviving text is divided into sections by horizontal lines. Each section consists of a short list of related identifications. For instance, the section of immediate interest (iv 20-22) is comprised of three lines that name the three heavens and identify each set of heavens with a stone. . ~. yveidner, in his article "Ein astrologischer Sammeltext aus der SargonIdenzelt (AfO 19 105-113), identified AO 8196 as one of eight exemplars of a Neo-Assyrian astrological work best known from K. 250+ (CT 26 40-41).9 In t~e article, an attempt is made to reconstruct the original tablet utilizing matenals from AO 8196, K. 250+, and the other sources. Although portions of AO 8196 do duplicate portions of these tablets, AO 8196 is not an exemplar of this astrological compendium. The list of heavens in AO 8196 iv 20-22 and six
other sections occupying AO 8196 iv 28-50, are not found in any ~reserved exemplar of the Neo-Assyrian work. However, the exact relationship between AO 8196 and the Neo-Assyrian tablets remains uncertain since all proposed exemplars for the Neo-Assyrian astrological text are incomplete. In addition to the section listing the three heavens, well preserved sections of AO 8196 include two lists of stars (iii 1-15; iii 16-38); a list of synonyms for $allummu 'comet' (iii 39-44);10 sections identifying the quadrants of the Moon, months, and watches of the night with the countries of Akkad, Elam, Amurru, and Subartu (iii 45-48; iv 13-19; iv 28-30); a section identifying various parts of the month, and the sun at sunrise and sunset, with various deities (iv 23-27); a list identifying the four winds with animals (iv 33-36); the names of the two calves of Adad and two horses of the flood (iv 37-42);11 and a list of seven manifestations of the goddess Gula worshipped in different cities (iv 43-50). Most of the information preserved on AO 8196 can be used when interpreting astronomical omens. The series Enuma Anu Enlil includes numerous omens relating to the observation of comets and meteors, the lands of Akkad, Elam, Amurru, and Subartu appear frequently in the apodoses of astronomical omens, and the interpretation of astronomical phenomena is dependent on the month of the year and time of night that the phenomena are observed. Yet, no

8 The Levels of the Universe
practical application for the names of the calves of Adad, horses of the flood, Gula-goddesses, or the list of the heavens is obvious.
The Levels of the Universe
The presentation of lists of cosmic regions in both KAR 307 (a mysticalreligious text) and AO 8196 (an astronomical-astrological text) demonstrates that the beliefs expressed in the lists were part of both the general religious traditions of Mesopotamia and the tenets of Mesopotamian astronomy and astrology. Of course, the disciplines of astronomy and astrology were but part of the overall religious system. Major deities such as Marduk, Anu, Enlil, and Ea were believed to have arranged the stars in heaven in early times, and gods are often identified with stars and constellations in astronomical works such as the "Astrolabes" and Mul-Apin.
The Heavens
The list of heavens in KAR 307 is drawn from two sources. The descriptions of the heavens in both KAR 307 and AO 8196 begin by identifying each heaven with a stone. These identifications can be identified as "Source A." AO 8196 preserves only material from "Source A:' KAR 307 adds additional information from a second source, "Source B." This information is introduced by sa and always includes a preterite verb. In each case, the subject of the verb apparently is Bel. The descriptions of the three earths in KAR 307 34-38 also derive from "Source B." Preterite verbs occur in these descriptions, with Bel apparently
also the subject.
Although the two sources are expertly joined by sa in KAR 307, a close inspection of KAR 307 30-38 reveals that the two sources are contradictory. In the opening portions of KAR 307 30-31, "Source J\' assigns the Upper Heavens to Anu and the Middle Heavens to the Igigi. "Source B" in the latter sections of line 30 and lines 32-33 disagrees. Here, the Igigi are placed in the Upper Heavens and Bel is placed in the Middle Heavens. Both sources, however, agree that the Lower Heavens belong to stars. The first part of line 33 assigns the Lower Heavens to stars, while the later half of the line states that Bel drew constellations on the Lower Heavens. This is not contradictory, because constellations are groups of stars. Below is a table identifying the denizens of the three heavens according to Sources A and B: 12
12 The division of the heavens into three zones is also attested in the second tablet of the series Bit Meseri where portions of the heavens are assigned to Anu, Enlil, and Ea:
u-qa-dis-ku dlugal-g'ir-ra same e sa-lal-ti-su-nu

The Stones of Heaven. Source A notes that the three heavens are compo.sed of luludanitu-stone, saggilmud-stone, and iaspu-stone 'jasper'. It is inconceivable that these heavens were composed of three giant contiguous blocks of stone, because this would not allow for movement within the heavens. Therefore, it must be assumed that the floors of each level of the heavens were composed of a different type of stone, and that there was open space between each stone floor, just as there is open space between the earth's surface and the Lower Heavens. Furthermore, it may be assumed that each stone floor was visible from bel~w and served as a roof for the region below. These assumptions find support III a parallel from Exodus, where the floor of heaven is apparently built of blue brick:
Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel rose up and they saw the God of Israel, and beneath his feet was the likeness of "sapphire" (Hebrew 1'00) brick just like the heavens for clarity. Exodus 24:9-10 (cf. Ezekiel 1:26-28, 10:1)
~ebrew 'sapphire', which is equated with Greek CHimp8tpOt; and Latin sappirus, IS a blue stone and has often been identified with lapis-Iazuli.13 Thus, the blue brick floor of heaven in Exodus, when seen from below, may be identified with the blue background color of the sky on clear days and the darker blue of the clear night sky. In KAR 307 30-31, Anu and the Igigi apparently stand on ~uludanitu-stone and saggilmud-stone floors of the Upper and Middle Heavens, Just as the God of Israel stands on a blue 'sapphire' brick heavenly floor in Exodus.
The Upper Heavens. The highest level of the universe in both KAR 307 and AO 8196 is called the Upper Heavens. Source A assigns this level of heaven to Anu and reveals that this level is made of luludanitu-stone. Source B states that Bel settled 300 Igigi in the Upper Heavens.
In this p~ssage, how~ver, the.t~ree heavens probably refer to the astronomical paths of
Anu, EnId, and Ea III the VlsIble heavens, rather than three superimposed levels of
heaven:.3 Note for exampl.e the followin.g general st~dies: The Interpreter's Dictionary of

tion of the stone with modem sapphire see D. Ginzburg, Eretz-Israell7 4*,83-85.



10 The Levels of the Universe
The assignment of the Upper Heavens to Anu in Source A identifies this heaven with the Heaven of Anu (samu sa danim; samu danim). The Heaven of Anu is well known in Akkadian literature and incantations. Examples of the Heaven of Anu occur in Gilgamesh, Nergal and Ereskigal, and Erra, as well as Akkadian incantations in the series Bit Meseri, Bit Rimki, and in NamburbisJ4 The identification of Anu's heaven as the highest level of heaven in KAR 307 and AO 8196 provides the most explicit evidence that the Heaven of Anu is in
fact the highest level of the universe. The reason for the identification of Anu's heaven with luladanitu-stone is unclear. In Abnu-sikinsu, a series describing the appearances of stones,15 luludanitu-stone is said to be a reddish stone:
[abnu(na4) siki]n(gar)-su kima na.l;ulali(nir)
na4mussari (m us. g 1r) na.lu-lu4-da-ni-tum sum[su] (m u. [n i])
[abnu sikin]-su sama(sa5) pU$a(babbar) u $alma(gi6) [e-d]i-il; na.lu-lu4-da-ni-tum sumsu STT 108:14-15
[The stone whose appear]ance is like hulalu-stone and mussaru-stone is named luludanitu-stone.
[The stone whose appearan]ce is red covered with white and black [patc]hes is named luludanitu-stone.
Thus KAR 307 and AO 8196 seem to imply that the surface of the Heaven of Anu was thought to be colored red, white, and black. There is no obvious explanation for this tradition. A few passages allude to red heavens, but these passages always refer to the red color of the sky at sunrise and sunset l6 rather than to a visible high heaven above the sky. Thus it seems likely that the reddish hue of the Upper Heavens is based on unknown religious or mythological considerationsJ7

15 For the series Abnu-sikinsu, see W. Horowitz, ZA 82 112-22.

50 18: 28-38; Nabnitu XX 44 (MSL XVI 181); and a number of passages where the Heav
ens are said to 'be beaten red' ~amta mabi~ at sunrise (see CAD S 124 samtu B). This ex
pression apparently refers to blood-red heavens, since the same expression is used for
bloody fingers in Labat TDP 98: 58-59. For blood in the sky in mythological contexts, see
Lugale 178; CT 1334 rev. 7'-9' (The Labbu-Myth); and a similar allusion in Ee IV 32. See
also CAD S 382 samu b), AfO Beih. 22 55-57, and S. Langdon, Babyl. 7234-35. For a par
allel expression urqa mabi~ 'to turn yellow/green', see W. von Soden, ZA 71 110: 3.
17 For instance, red, white, and black luludanitu-stone may be identified with the
Heaven of Anu because Anu himself is identified with the colors red, white, and black.
In Summa-Alu (CT 40 49: 29-30), a red bird with a white patch on his head is identified as the "bird of Anu;' and red, white, and black patterns of decorative cones were found
in the archaeological remains of Anu's city, Uruk (see for example Bagd. Mitt. Beih. 1 Beilage 2-3, taf. 1-7).
The Levels of the Universe 11
The tradition of 300 Igigi in the Upper Heavens in Section B agrees with the apocryphal line of Enuma Elish, Ee VI 69:
300 di-gt-t sa sa-ma-[m]i u 600 sa apsi kali(du)-su-nu pal;-ru
The 300 Igigi of heaven and 600 of the Apsu, a~l of them, were gathered.
In Ee VI 37-44, Marduk places 300 Anunnaki, rather than Igigi, in heaven.
The Middle Heavens. Source A assigns the Middle Heavens to the Igigi and notes that these heavens are made of saggilmud-stone. Source B explains that Bel's cella is located in the Middle Heavens. . T~e identifi?ation of the Middle Heavens with saggilmud-stone is appropnate, smce saggzlmud-stone is a blue stone. The blue color of saggilmud-stone can be established on the basis of information in Uruanna, Urgud and Abnusikinsu. In Uruanna (MSL X 70: 30) and Urgud (MSL X 33: 113): saggilmudstone is identified as l;asmanu-stone. The color of saggilmudll;asmanu-stone can be established on the basis of l;asmanu-colored wool. In an economic tablet from Ugarit, l;asmanu-colored wool is said to be a shade of lapis-lazuli colored wool:
2 tugkitu gad[ames 2 me-a]t sikiuqni (za.gln) 2 me-at siki na.l;as-ma-ni a-na [ ... ]
2 tugkitu mes f21 [me-a]t sikiuqnimes 2 me-at sikiuqni l;as-ma-ni a-na mar [ ... ] 1 tugkitit me-at siki!uqni 1 me-at sikiuqni~l;as-ma-ni a-na lutup-pa-nu-[ru]

2 garments (made of) 2[00] (shekels) of blue wool (and) 200 of blue-"hasmanu" wool for the "son" [ ... ] 1 garment (made of) 100 (shekels) of blue wool (and)
100 of blue-"hasmanu" wool for the tuppanu[ru-official]
The description of saggilmud-stone in Abnu-sikinsu, although partially damaged, confirms that saggilmud-stone is the same color as lapis-lazuli:
abnu sikin-su kima [na.]fu-qu1-ni na.sag-fgi[l-mud sum[su] STT 108:88
The stone whose appearance is like lapis-lazuli is named saggilmud-stone
The blue lapis-like color of the Middle Heavens may be compared with the blue brick roof of the sky in Exodus 24:10. Therefore, KAR 307 and AO 8196 suggest that the bottom surface of the Middle Heavens was visible from the earth's surface.



12 The Levels of the Universe
The Cella of Bel in the Middle Heavens .IS In KAR 30731-32, Tradition B describes a heavenly cella of Bel in the Middle Heavens. Two elements of the cella appear in the text: bara == parakku and bara.man == paramaJ;u. It is difficult to distinguish between these two terms, since KAR 307 31-32 provides the only contextual example of parakku and paramaJ;u together, and chairs can be placed on both. UITa 5, for example, lists chairs of both the parakku and paramaJ;u: 19
[gisgu.za.bara.m] an
MIN (kussi)] pa-rak-ki (chair of the parakku) [MIN] pa!-ra!-ma-J;u!
(chair of the paramaJ;u) Urra 5 87-87a (see MSL V 157, IX 170)
The translation of parakku as 'sanctuary' is based on Malku and Explicit Malku, which list parakku as a synonymn for a number of words meaning 'shrine, sanctuary, etc.' (A. Kilmer, JAOS 83 429: 274-75,443: 152-55). The second part of the description of Bel's cella, as written, states that Bel made a GIS bU-$i NA4 el-me-si shine inside the cella. This phrase is problematic. As preserved GIS bU-$i NA4 el-me-Si can refer to three objects, t~o objects, _or a single object. For instance, there may be three separate w~od (~IS), gl.ass (bu$u),
and stone (nf4elmesu) furnishings in the cella of Bel; a gtsbu-$~ that IS made of wood and glass, plus a stone object; or a single wooden object inlaid with glass and elmesu-stone. Two suggested emendations solve some but not all of these difficulties. CAD B 349 bU$u A 3' deletes GIS, and translates:
He (Marduk) made it shine within with bU$u-glass and crystal (elmesu-stone).
This translation, however, does not explain the form or function of the glass and elmesu-stone. CAD E 107 (sub elmeSu a) offers a better solution. Here, the editors of CAD emend to read gisbu-$i-(in} and then translate 'lamp (made of) elmesu-stone', explaining that Marduk lit a lamp (bu$innu) of elmesu-stone in the cella.20 A parallel can then be found in an Esarhaddon oracle where IStar
lights a light of elmesu-stone in a heavenly cella: 21
18 For cellas and daises in Heaven, see pp. 250-52. 19 PSD B does not separate bara from bara.mah. Sumerian bara.mah is translated into Akkadian in bilingual texts by the both the loanword pararr:alJ,u. and as pa,rakku $lru 'majestic dais' (see PSD B 142 3-5). The loanword paramalJ,u IS chosen III KAR 307 31 so that the word parakku is not repeated in both KAR 307 31 and 32. However, a rendering parakku $lru remains possible. See PSD B 135-36 1.4 for examples of gisgu.za.bara and giSgu.za.bara.mah in Sumerian texts.
20 B. Landsberger OCS 21 154) also emends bU-$i-(in) and translat~s 'La,:npe'.
A. Oppenheim (Oppenheim Glass 16; Oppenheim Man an~ Nature 641) omIts GIS and translates 'bu$u-glass'. A. Livingstone (SAA 3100) translates has made a lamp of electrum
shine there'.
21 Note the Hebrew parallel in Ezek 1:26-27 and an Akkadian parallel in KAR 98 rev. 8-9: u-ki-in ina qaqqadi ka-ka-a[b-t]am el-me-si nam-r[i] 'I placed on the head a star of shining elmeSu-stone'. For possible Sumerian parallels, see M. Stol, Natural Phenomena 255, 269 n. 90.

However, one might object that bU$innu normally means 'lamp-wick', while the lamp itself is a bit bU$inni 'house of the wick' (see CAD B 348). Nonetheless, a copper bU$innu 'lamp' is found in ADD 964 rev. 15 without bitU. 22 Another reference to the Middle Heavens (same qabluti) is to be found in the mystical explanatory work OECT 11 69+70 i 35-37 (OECT 11 p. 28) in the context of a celebration of an Akitu festival of Ninurta on the 24th of Iyar:
den-liZ iJ;-du-sum-ma fbuLsu-rat sul-mi a-na dlugal-du6-ku-ga a-na samee qab-lu-(ti) is-pur
OECT 11 p. 28, nos. 69+70: 33'-34'
Enlil rejoiced over him (Ninurta) and sent a message of well-being for Lugaldukuga to the Middle Heavens.
The appearance of Lugalkuduga in the Middle Heavens in this passage is puzzling. Elsewhere, Lugalkuduga is either an ancestor of Enlil who dwells in the underworld, or a name for Ea who is normally to be found in the Apsu (see W. G. Lambert, RIA 7 133-34). If Lugalkuduga in this context is the underworld god, then one might find a parallel in Adapa, where the underworld gods Tammuz and Gizzida stand at the Gate of Anu at the entrance to heaven (p. 65). If Lugalkuduga is Ea, then one might note the events in Nergal and EreSkigal, where Ea is to be found in the heavens along with Anu and Enlil (p. 66).
The Lower Heavens. Sources A and B agree that the Lower Heavens were composed of jasper and that these heavens belong to stars. Source A assigns the jasper heavens to the stars in general, while Source B is more specific, explaining that Marduk drew the lumasu 'constellations' on the jasper heavens.
Jasper is a type of chalcedony, a hard, glassy, often translucent stone.23 Many ancient varieties of translucent chalcedony were called jasper (tU0'1W; == iaspis) in the classical world, although modern jasper is generally opaque. Pliny, in his Natural History (Book 37 37), states that jasper (iaspis) is often translucent and refers to many varieties of "jasper;' including a hard, dull, grayishgreen jasper from Cyprus, a sky blue "aerizusa" jasper from Persia, and rosecolored, violet, yellow, and purple varieties of jasper. The sky-blue "aerizusa" jasper from Persia is appropriate for the jasper of the Lower Heavens in KAR
22 Note also a bit giSbu-si-ni in BAM 304: 20'.
23 See G. F Herbert Su{ith, Gemstones (1940) 348-49.



14 The Levels of the Universe
307 and AO 8196, since the Greeks thought this variety of jasper resembled the appearance of the sky in Autumn:
The fourth variety (of jasper) is known among (the Greeks) as "boria" or "northwind" jasper, because it is like the sky on an autumn morning. This will be identified with the kind that is called "aerizusa." Pliny Natural History 37 37 (Loeb Classical Library 10 258-59)
Descriptions of two varieties of jasper in Abnu-sikinsu explain why the Lower Heavens are identified with jasper in Mesopotamia:
abnu sikin-su kima same e za-ku-ti n"-4as-pu-u sumsu abnu sikin-su kima urpat(dungu) rib$i(glri.bal) [n"-4a]s-pu-u sumsu
BAM 378 iv 19-2211STT 108: 76-77 24
The stone whose appearance is like the clear heavens is named jasper. The stone whose appearance is like a rain cloud is named U]asper.
Another reference to jasper of the heavens is found in CT 51 89 iii 13:
. . . ] na4as-pu-u sa kima fsame e1 [ ... ... ] jasper which like heaven [ ...
The series Abnu-sikinsu describes a gray jasper that has the appearance of the overcast sky and a variety of jasper that has the appearance of the clear sky. T~e first variety may be compared with the grayish-green jasper of Cyprus, while the second is probably to be identified with sky-blue jasper of Persia or yellow jasper. On clear sunny days, the blue sky often appears to be tinged yellow by the sun. Both varieties of jasper in Abnu-sikinsu are appropriate stones for the Lower Heavens. On cloudy days, the lowest portion of heaven appears to be colored gray by clouds, while on sunny days, the lowest portion of heaven seems to
be the clear, open sky. In his Natural History (3737 115), Pliny states that ancient jasper (iaspis) was often translucent. This would explain how the blue saggilmud-stone floor of the Middle Heavens could be seen from the earth's surface through the 'jasper' floor of the Lower Heavens. There is no evidence t~at saggilmud-stone is translucent, so the blue saggilmud-stone floor of the Middle Heavens apparently kept humans from seeing into the homes of Anu, th: Igigi, and Bel ~n the Middle Heavens and Highest Heavens, above the saggtlmud-stone. It IS not clear, however, how the jasper of the Lower Heavens might have been thought
to change from clear to cloudy. The terminology of KAR 307 33 suggests that the stars and constellations were thought to be etched directly onto the jasper surface of the Lower Heavens. The text explains that the stars are drawn ina mubbi the Lowest Heavens. This prepositional phrase is apparently contrasted with ina libbi, which occurs seven times in KAR 307 30-38. The Igigi, "spirits of mankind;' Ea, and the

difference between KU ( p3) and SU (P )is but a single stroke.
The Levels of the Universe 15
Anunnaki all dwell ina libbi their regions. Thus ina libbi here must mean 'on (and above) the surface of the region', because mankind lives on and above the surface of the earth. In contrast, ina mubbi occurs just one time in KAR 307 33 and implies that the stars were drawn directly onto the stone surface of the Lower Heavens. In a parallel on a late Lamastu tablet, ina mubbi and e$eru are used when a lunar crescent and solar disk are etched onto a clay tablet:
du.du.bi tuppa(dub) tasattar(sar)ar uskara(u 4.sakar) samsata(as.me) [kakkaba gamla] ina muh-hi te-es-sir ...
LKD 33 r~v: 18-19 + duplicates (see CAD SI1 333 c)
It's ritual, you inscribe a tablet. A crescent moon, solar-disk, [star, and hooked-staff] on it you draw ...
Further evidence for stars and constellations inscribed onto the sky is found in other Akkadian texts. In a literary passage from Enuma Anu Enlil, Anu, Enlil, and Ea draw constellations in the sky (E. Weidner, AfO 17 89:4-5). In The Labbu Myth, Enlil draws a 50-league-long constellation in the heavens:
den-lil ina same e i-te-$er [ ..... ] 50 beru mu-rak-su 1 ber[u ru-pu-us-su]
CT 1333:7-8
Enlil, in the heavens, drew [ ..... ] 50 leagues was its length, 1 leagu[e was its width.]
Another text explains how to draw various constellations, including mU1su.gi 'Perseus', mU1al.l u5 'Cancer' and mU1mar.gid.da 'Ursa Major' (E. Weidner, AfO 4 74
75). Surviving sketches of constellations are found on the Neo-Assyrian planisphere CT 3310, and drawings of stars and constellations, including mU1ur.gu.la 'Leo' and the seven stars of m ul.m ul 'Pleiades', are found in E. Weidner GestimDarstellungen pIs. 1-2,5-6, and 9-10. 25 A tradition that the fixed-stars were inscribed onto the surface of the heavens implies that this surface rotated every 24 hours, since inscribed stars could not move independently. This tradition is reasonable since stars and constellations maintain fixed positions relative to one another as if inscribed on a rotating sphere. The Sun, Moon, and planets do not maintain fixed positions in relation to the stars, leading later Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic astronomers to speculate that these heavenly bodies were located on different levels or spheres from the fixed stars.
25 For CT 3310 (K. 8538), see now J Koch, Neue Untersuchungen zur Topographie des babylonischen Fixsternhimmels. Note also the tenns sitir burilme ('writing of the night-sky') and sitir same ('writing of heaven'), which refer to the arrangement of the stars in the sky; the drawing of miijratu 'boundary lines' in the sky in Ee V 3; the stars drawn on circular 'Astrolabes' (CT 33 11); and the Old Akkadian exercise tablet AfO 25 104.



16 The Levels of the Universe
The Earths
KAR 307 34-38 lists and identifies three earths. The Upper Earth is inhabited by the "spirits of mankind;' the Middle Earth by Ea, and the Lower Earth by 600 Anunnaki. These inhabitants live inion the dannatu of these earths. It is almost certain that the dannatu of these earths are the surfaces of each earth, although dannatu has a wide range of meanings including 'hard ground', 'fortress', 'hard times', 'bottom of a foundation pit', and even a part of the lungs (see CAD D 87). The only direct evidence connecting dannatu with the earth is found in Malku I 51 where dannatu is listed as a synonym for ammatu (A. Kilmer, JAOS 83 425). In the commentary to the Babylonian Theodicy (BWL 74: 58), ammatis is explained as kima er$etu ('like earth'), so dannatu can be a name for 'earth' as a whole. Indirect evidence for dannatu as the surfaces of the earths is found in the equivalence between dannatu and Sumer
ian KLKAL, literally 'hard earth'. If this sense of dannatu is intended, then the dannatu of the three earths could correspond to the stone floors of the three heavens. The dannatu of the Apsu, in this case, would be the the 'ocean floor' of the Apsu, rather than the top surface of the Apsu.
The Upper Earth. The Upper Earth should logically be the earth's surface, because the earth's surface lies directly beneath the heavens. Yet, KAR 307 34 places the ziqiqu of mankind on this earth, and ziq'iqu normally are ghosts of the dead (see CAD Z 58-59). Dead human beings reside in the underworld rather than on the earth's surface. A parallel from the series Bit Rimki helps solve this paradox:

The Levels of the Universe 17
In Bit Rimki, there is no suggestion that the ziqiqil sa nap/;ar nisi 'spirits of all men' are located anywhere but the surface of the earth. Thus, the ziqiqi amelilti 'spirits of mankind' in KAR 307 34 must be the embodied spirits of living humans on the earth's surface. A parallel may be found in the Kassite period Sumerian literary work The Duties and Powers of the Gods that is inscribed on fragments of a statue of Kurigalzu:
a.n[el.er ki.a su.nigin a.za.lu.lu al.n6.n6 Sumer 4 pI. 4 vi 1'-6'
For him, they lay down all of mankind on earth.
In this passage, unnamed gods settle a.za.lu.lu on ki. Here, ki must be the earth's surface, because the underworld is identified as kur in this text (see p. 144). Sumerian n u parallels rabti$u in KAR 30734, and a.za.l u.l u is equivalent to both ameliltu 'mankind' and nammastu 'herd-animals'.26
The Middle Earth. The Middle Earth belongs to Ea. This earth must be the Apsu since the Apsu is the cosmic region of EnkilEa. In Ee IV 145-46, Ea occupies the Apsu when Anu and Enlil take possesion of the heavens (samtimil) and Esarra. KAR 307 36 is obscure. The verb in the line, umassi, may be understood as a preterite of mussulmussu'to identify' or a III1 preterite of masu 'to for
gef. 27 In the latter case, a parallel might be found in LKA 73:5:
· .. siPl-/;i ul a-mas-si LKA 73 rev. 5 (SAA 3 104)
· .. rebeillion? I will not forget
The verb mussulmussu 'to identify' does not occur in the III stem. It is not certain, however, how a rebellion in KAR 307 36 could be connected with Bel, Ea, and the Apsu, because no account of a rebellion by Ea against Marduk is known. In a parallel to KAR 307 36 in a mystical-religious text, Marduk sends Ea down to the Apsu without any reference to a rebellion:
· .. de-a sa ina tu-li-su dbel i-dar-su-ma a-na apsi u-se-rid-[sul
Livingstone 116:2 (SAA 3 96: 8-9)
· .. Ea, whom Bel pushed away from his bosom and sent down to the Apsu.
The term er$etu qablitu 'Middle Earth' also occurs a number of times in BE 39099, a late-Babylonian account of the flood (Lambert-Millard Atra-basis
26 For nti = rabi$U, see AHw 933. For a.za.lu.lu = both amelutu 'mankind' and nammastu 'herd animals', see CAD A/2 58, Nil 234. 27 For examples of mussillmussil 'to identify' written with variants sand S, see Shamash Hymn 127 (BWL 134) and Erra V 10 (Cagni Erra 122-23).



18 The Levels of the Universe
116-21). In this text, the Middle Earth is not necessarily the Apsu. BE 39099
explains that Sin and Nergal were assigned to guard the Middle Earth before
the flood at a time when Anu and Adad guarded the heavens, and Ea guarded
the sigaru nal;balu tamti 'bolt, "Net of the Sea"'. If the Middle Earth in BE
39099 is the Apsu, Ea may have been removed from his region because he
could not be trusted to implement the commands of Enlil. In both Atral;asis
and the flood story of Gilg. XI, Ea saves the human race by revealing the secret of the flood.
The Lowest Earth
The bottom level of the universe in KAR 307 is the Lowest Earth. This
earth is the underworld. KAR 307 37 notes that Bel shut 600 Anunnaki in the
underworld.
The information in KAR 307 37 is consistent with much of our knowledge
of the underworld. As noted earlier, the Anunnaki, from the Kassite period
onward, are almost always undetworld gods, and a few texts confirm that the
Anunnaki of the underworld numbered 600. For instance, a hymn to Nergal
praises the king of the underworld as the asir dannina saniq ner 'Controller of
the underworld, Supervisor of the 600' (Bollenrucher NergaI8:4),28 while a late
bilingual passage refers to the 600 Anunnaki of 'earth':
da.nun.na ki.a mu.us.u.bi
da-nun-na-ki sa ersetimtim ne-e-er-su
. SBH 139:157-58
The Anunnaki of the earth, the 600 of them.
It is also implied elsewhere that the Anunnaki are locked in the underworld,
although no text other than KAR 307 explicitly states this fact. In An Address of
Marduk to the Demons, the Anunnaki are located within the gates of the under
world (AfO 19 117 24-30). Furthermore, the underworld name en}et la tari
'Earth of No Return' indicates that Anunnaki could not have reasonably hoped
to escape from the realm of the dead. Only privileged officers of the under
world, such as Kaka, the vizier of Ereskigal in Nergal and Ereskigal, ever left
the gates of the underworld, but even Kaka was expected to return. An excep
tion is Inanna/IStar in Inanna's Descent and The Descent of IStar, but she must
provide a substitute to take her place in the underworld. . .
The tradition that Marduk, or any god, locked the Anunnaklm the under
world is not found in surviving Mesopotamian texts, but a parallel may be
found in the Theogony of Hesiod. In the Theogony, Zeus jails his defeated ene
mies in Tartarus after putting down their rebellion against his rule (Hesiod
Theogony 713-35).
28 For the name of the Anunnaki written d600(CES.U), note also Borger Esarh. 79:
9,96: 8; SM 3 8: 26,30; 9: 8 (= Craig ABRT 29-31); 72: 12 (Underworld Vision); Living
stone 32: 4.
The Levels of the Universe 19
. It is certain that Enuma Elish is not the source of KAR 307 37. Enuma
Ehsh does not even mention the underworld, and Ee VI 39-44 places 300
Anunnaki in earth, rather than 600 Anunnaki, as in KAR 307.
. The fina.ll.ine p:eserved on .the obverse, KAR 307 38, refers in some way
to psper, but It IS unlikely that thIS line continues the description of the under
world, because line 37 ends with a preterite verb. Preterite verbs mark the end
of the descriptions of each of the five previous cosmic regions in KAR 307 30-37.



Chapter 2
"The Babylonian Map of the World"
The Late Babylonian tablet BM 92687 preserves a unique Babylonian bird's-eye view of the earth's surface. The sketch, commonly called "The Babylonian Map of the World" or "Mappa Mundi;' occupies the upper half of the obverse, while the remainder of the obverse and entire reverse preserve related textual information. The text was first published more than a century ago by F. E. Peiser (ZA 4 [1889] 361-70) and then recopied by R. C. Thompson in 1906 as CT 22 48. This second copy served as the basis for later studies by E. Weidner (BoSt 6 [1922] 85-93) and E. Unger (in Unger Babylon 254-58 [1931]). Then, in 1988, I published a new edition and copy of BM 92687 in Iraq 50 (1988) 147-65. More recently, 1. Finkel identified and joined a tiny ("square inch or so of backed clay"), but important, fragment to the map on the obverse. 1 A revised copy and photographs of BM 92687 are found below (see pp. 402-3, 405-6).2

The Date and Composition of the Text
25
The map, at least, can be no older than the ninth century. The author of the map calls the ocean marratu (salt-sea) and includes the sites of Bit Yakin (no, 10) and Urartu (no. 3). The earliest example of marratu occurs in an inscription of Shalmaneser III (S5S-S24) that identifies the name as a loanword from a Chaldean dialect into Akkadian:
5 1 us (720 cubits) + 2 $UPPU (120 cubits) (see RIA 7 459 Table II). As written,
$uppan is dual.
6 1 aslu = 120 cubits (see RlA 7 459).



26 "The Babylonian Map of the World"
ka-sid ultu tam-di rabfti ti sa mat a-mur-ri sa sul-me dsam-si a-di tam-di sa mat kal-di sa idmar-ra-tam i-qa-bu-si-ni
KAH 1003-6 (E. Michel, WO 1 387; cf. WO 1 466:51)
Conqueror from the Great Sea of the Land of Amurru of the setting of the Sun to the Sea of the Land of Chaldea which they call the marratu.
Likewise, Bit Yakin also occurs for the first time during the ninth century (see Brinkman PKB 169, 199), and Urartu occurs regularly in Neo-Assyrian inscriptions beginning at this time, although an earlier form Uruatri occurs in Middle Assyrian inscriptions (see RGTC 5 274-75). It is likely, however, that the map dates to the late eighth or seventh century. In the Shalmaneser III inscription, the Persian Gulf is called marratu, while the Mediterranean is called ttlmdu rabftu. The World Map identifies the entire world ocean as marratu. The earliest evidence that the Mediterranean was called marratu is found in an inscription of Sargon II (721-705) where the king rules the Ulmarrati eliti and idmarrati sapliti 'Upper and Lower Ocean' (R. C. Thompson, Iraq 7 112 fig. 1:12). It is not certain if the text on the obverse and reverse was composed together with the map. The text on the reverse was probably written to accompany the map, because both include nagu, but the text on the obverse was probably composed separately and joined to the map by a later editor. This text calls the ocean tamtu, instead of marratu, and does not mention any of the places drawn on the map. The map was composed in Babylonia rather than Assyria. Babylon is represented by a large rectangle encompassing almost half the width of the central continent, while Assyria is represented as a small oval. The provenance of the Late Babylonian copy BM 92687.itself is uncertain. Most of the 82-7-14 collection (BM 92687 = 82-7-14, 509) is from Sippar (see Leichty Cat. 6 xxxiii), but it is possible that the tablet comes from Borsippa. The tablet preserving the map (82-7-14,509) is assigned an out-of-sequence BM number (see Leichty Cat. 6 198), suggesting that the tablet may not be from Sippar, and the colophon of the tablet identifies the scribe who prepared BM 92687 as a descendant of Ea-bel-ili. In an economic document, a scribe of the same name is identified as being from Borsippa:
mitti-dnabu-balatu mar-su sa mla-a-ba-si mar mdea-bel-ili mes bar-sipaki TuM IIIlII 220:12-13
Itti-NabU-balatu, the son of Labasi, the descendant of Ea-bel-ih of Borsippa
ThcMap
The map as preserved depicts the earth's surface as two concentric circles, with triangular areas radiating from the outer circle. The area within the inner
The Map 27
circle represents the central continental portion of the earth's surface, where important sites such as Babylon and Assyria are located. The area between the two circles is identified as the marratu 'ocean'. On the map, this cosmic ocean circumambulates the central continent. The area beyond the outer circle consists of the triangular areas, which are identified as nagu 'regions', and unchartered space. The drawing is unique among ancient Mesopotamian maps. Numerous maps or plans of cities and rural areas, such as the map of Nippur (S. N. Kramer, FTS 274),7 are known, but only the World Map is drawn on an international scale. Nevertheless, the World Map utilizes standard Mesopotamian cartographic conventions. Both the World Map and small-scale maps use geometric shapes to represent topographic features. For instance, the placement of the marratu 'ocean' within two concentric circles is comparable to the practice of drawing rivers and canals within parallel lines representing their banks. One small map fragment (RA 4, plates follOWing p. 84 no. 72) even preserves a circular segment of a river or canal that is similar in shape to the cosmic ocean on the World Map.s Similarly, the oval shape of the region marked 'mountain' (no. 1) may be compared with semicircular hills drawn on the Old Akkadian map from Nuzi (HSS 10 1). Nonetheless, the World Map differs from other cuneiform maps and plans in other respects. On other cuneiform maps, rivers, fields, buildings, and other features are drawn to scale, and the relative positions of features seem reasonable. In contrast, the relative size and location of many of the features on the World Map seem preposterous. For instance, the circle representing the city of Der (no. 5) is as large as the circle representing Assyria.
The Continent
The continent on the World Map contains various geometric shapes representing places and topographic features. The place-names include the countries of Assyria (no. 4) and Urartu (no. 3); the cities of Babylon (no. 13) and Der (no. 5); and Bit Yakin (no. 10) and Habban (no. 12). Topographic features include sadu'mountain' (no. 1), apparu'swamp' (no. 7), and bitqu 'channel' (no. 9). The oval labeled Susa (no. 8) is placed within the circle representing the continent but is located across the 'swamp' and 'channel' from Babylonia. The parallel lines that begin in the region marked 'mountain' and end in the rectangle marked 'channel' and 'swamp' provide the means for interpreting the map. On cuneiform maps and plans, parallel lines represent river banks. On

28 "The Babylonian Map of the World"
the World Map, the parallel lines are not identified, but the course of the lines indicates that they represent the banks of the Euphrates. Near the middle of the map, the two parallel lines bisect the rectangle labeled 'Babylon'. In the first millennium, the Euphrates flowed through the center of Babylon. Herodotus (Book 1 180) states: "there are two sections of the city [Babylon] for a river flows through the middle. It's name is the Euphrates." Nebuchadnezzar speaks of building projects on both sides of the river (VAB 4 130:7-132:30), and the excavations of Babylon by Koldewey found architectural remains on both sides of the ancient course of the river (see R. Koldewey, Excavations at Babylon, 16). When the parallel lines are identified as the Euphrates, the locations of many of the other features on the map become clear. The 'mountain' at the source of the river represents the mountains of southern Turkey where Shalmaneser III visited the sources of the Tigris and the Euphrates:

Layard ICC 92:92-93 (E. Michel, WO 2 152)
In the 15th year of my reign, I went by the headwater(s) of the Tigris and Euphrates. My royal relief I erected on their cliff's.
On the bronze gates of Balawat, this expedition to the sources of the rivers is drawn in mountains (L. W. King, Bronze Reliefs, pI. 109). The rectangle at the mouth of the river marked apparu 'swamp' and bitqu 'channel' represents the swamps along the lower Euphrates and a waterway connecting the mouth of the Euphrates with the Persian Gulf. The modern Euphrates does not issue directly into the Persian Gulf but joins with the Tigris to form the Shatt-AI-Arab, a channel connecting the rivers to the Gulf. The left edge of the rectangle on the World Map, next to the label bitqu, touches the shore of the marratu, so the bitqu is probably an ancient equivalent of the Shatt-AI-Arab. In a letter, this ancient bitqu is located near Bit Yakin, just as Bit Yakin is drawn along the shore of the bitqu on the map:
llisakin temi(cAR.KU) if e-muq sa bit-illia-a-ki-nu it-ti-su-nu a-di mulJlJi bit-qa ki-i il-li-ku-ni ABL 542:12-13
The governor and forces of Bit-Yakin went with them as far as the bitqu.
It is likely that the bitqu was a shipping channel that enabled ships to bypass the marshes of southern Babylonia on their way to the open sea, because the bitqu on the map connects the mouth of the Euphrates with the ocean and leads away from the area marked 'swamp'. The bend of the Euphrates by the rectangle marked 'Babylon' apparently represents the shift in the course of the river from southeast to a more southerly direction, near Babylon, rather than the great bend of the Euphrates upstream. In contrast to the relatively accurate depiction of the course of the Euphrates, the map omits the Tigris altogether. The Tigris should rise in the
The Map 29
oval marked 'mountain', pass through Assyria and to the right of the rectangle labeled 'Babylon', before emptying into the rectangle marked 'channel' and 'swamp'. The ancient course of the Tigris passed approximately 80 km. northeast of Babylon in the first millennium (see RGTe 8, maps). Thus, it is not possible that the two parallel lines represent both the Euphrates and the Tigris. The locations of other features are also problematic. Assyria and Urartu are correctly placed east of the Euphrates, with Urartu north of Assyria, but Assyria is located too far south in relation to Babylon. Bit Yakin, the southernmost entity in Babylonia during the first millennium, is correctly positioned near the mouth of the Euphrates, but is moved from the east side of the river to the west. Susa is correctly positioned below the outlet of the Euphrates, but should be located to the right of Babylon, rather than directly below the city. Habban (no. 12) is located west of the Euphrates, although the land and city
Habban of the Kassite tribe Bit Habban were located east of the Tigris.9 Other features on the map cannot be identified. The crescent-shaped area extending from the east bank of the Euphrates to the marratu (no. 6) may represent an arm of the ocean separating southern Babylonia from Elam, since the traces inside the the figure can be restored [ma]r-ra-[tum].lO This crescent, however, might also be an arm of the Euphrates ([p]u-ra-[tu]), a canal, or even a road ([lJa]r-ra-[nu]) leading from the river to the coast. Of course, the two circles identified uru (city) and the three circles containing only compass points cannot be identified. The reason that these sites are not labeled is unclear, but it is likely that their names were damaged on an earlier copy of the map. However, it is also possible that these sites may be ancient ruins whose names were no longer remembered, such as the 'ruined cities' in obv. 2.
The marratu 'Ocean'
The circular band enclosing the continent is identified four times on the map as the marratu 'ocean' (nos. 14-17). The term marratu is a first-millennium synonym of tamtu 'sea'. For instance, Sargon II of Assyria states that the gods entrusted him with leadership of the peoples istu idmarrati elfti adi idmarrati sapliti 'from the Upper Ocean to the Lower Ocean' (R. C. Thompson, Iraq 7 112 fig. 1:12), just as Sargon of Akkad is given the tiamtam alitam u sapiltam 'Upper and Lower Sea' by EnUl in a third-millennium inscription (H. H. Hirsch, AfO 20 48:9-13, Gelb-Kienast 182). The term marratu, unlike tamtu, is often written with the ID determinative used for rivers and canals. This suggests that the marratu was thought to be a relatively narrow body of water rather than a boundless sea. On the map, the marratu is bounded on both sides by circles and, as drawn, is not much wider
9 See RGTe 8145.
10 RIA 8229 suggests 'Horn of the Sea' (i.e., [qa]-ra-[an tamti]) and a relationship between this term and the Sumerian equivalent si a.ab.ba in the writing of the Sumer
ian name of Borsippa (bad.sLa.ab.ba ki). The reference to A. L. Oppenheim, Dict. of Scientific Biography (= Oppenheim Man and Nature) in RIA 8229 should be to p. 655 n. 31.



30 "The Babylonian Map of the World"
than the Euphrates. This mistake in scale almost certainly reflects the crudity of the map rather than a belief that the world ocean was almost as narrow as a major river. Similarly, the fact that the lines marking the banks of the Euphrates touch the inner shore of the marratu need not necessarily mean that Mesopotamians thought that the Euphrates began at the cosmic sea.
The nagu
The five triangular areas (nos. 18-22) radiating from the outer circle are identified as nagu. When complete, the map may have included as many as eight such nagu. The text on the reverse describes eight nagu, and there is room for additional missing nagu along the broken bottom edge of the map where Peiser drew two nagu in ZA 4 369. Nevertheless, it is not possible to correlate the surviving nagu on the map with those described on the reverse, and it cannot even be certain that the nagu described on the reverse are identical to those drawn on the map. On the reverse, the nagu are said to be seven leagues ina birit 'in between', but the nagu on the map itself are not equidistant from each other. The nagu on the map, however, are all equidistant from the coast of the continent so "seven leagues" may measure the distance across the marratu to the nagu, rather than the space between nagu.
The Term nagfi in Assyrian and Babylonian Texts. In the first millennium, the geographic term nagu is common in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions, but rare in Late Babylonian royal inscriptions and literary texts. In Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions, nagu is generally used with a political nuance to refer to administrative districts or provinces. For example, Sargon II states that he conquered 430 cities belonging to seven nagu'districts' (TCL 3 66:422), and Sennacherib conquers the nagu 'province' of Judah (OIP 2 86:15).1l This Assyrian meaning of nagu is not appropriate for the World Map because there is no evidence that any Mesopotamian king conquered any of the nagu nor are the nagu across the marratu divided into political units. In Late Babylonian royal inscriptions, the term nagu is used for distant unspecified areas. This sense of the word is appropriate for the World Map. The term nagu survive~ five times in published Late Babylonian royal inscriptions: four times in the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar and once in those of Nabonidus. In three of the Nebuchadnezzar examples, the nagu are located ina qereb tamti 'in the sea', suggesting that these nagu are islands. 12

nagil A 1. For a possible Old Babylonian example of nagil, see A. Grayson and E. Sollberger, RA 70 115 L II 12'.
12 Oppenheim (Man and Nature 655 n. 36) connects this sense of nagil with an Ara
maic cognate nagwan. For an equation between the nagil on the World Map with "the isles of nations" in Genesis 10:5, see W. Horowitz, VTSup 4135-43. MSL 1760 n. 74 no
longer identifies eil and nagil as near synonyms in ErimlJ,us as in CAD I/J 317 eil. H. and
]. Lewy (HUCA 1712-13) argued that the nagil on the World Map are mountains rising
The Map 31
The clearest example is found in a description of the empire that Marduk granted to Nebuchadnezzar:
ku-ul-la-at ma-rti1-ta-an gi-mi-ir ka-la da-ad-mi ul-tu ti-a-am-tim e-litim a-di ti-a-am-tim sa-ap-li-tim matati (ma.da.ma.da) ru-qa-a-tim

BE 111 85 ii 13-29 (VAB 4 146 ii 17-33) (cf. VAB 4 146 iii 2-148 iii 7; 206:17)
All the lands, the entire inhabited world from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, distant lands, the people of vast territories, kings of far away mountains and remote nagu in the Upper and Lower Sea, whose lead-rope Marduk, my lord, placed in my hand in order to pull his yoke.
In the remaining Nebuchadnezzar inscription (CT 4645 v 23-24) and the Nabonidus inscription (c. J. Gadd, AnSt 8 52:20), nagu are also said to be distant (nesu), but it is not clear if they are located in the sea since both passages are
broken. Further evidence for nagu as islands in the sea may be found in The Gilgamesh Epic where nagu emerge at the edge of the sea as the waters of the flood recede:
ap-pa-li-is kib-ra-a-ti pa-tu tamti(a.ab.ba) a-na 12 (var. 14)ta.am i-te-la-a na-gu-u
a-na kurni-mus He-mid giselippu(m a) 13 sadu u kurni-mus giselippa i$-bat-ma a-na na-a-si ul id-din
Gilg. XI 138-41 (Thompson Gilg. pI. 48)
I scanned the regions at the edge of the sea. At (each) 12 (var. 14) a nagu appeared.
After the ship put in at Mt. Nimus, the mountain Mt. Nimus held the boat fast, did not allow it to rock.
In this passage, the nagu are the first outcroppings of dry land to emerge after the flood. These nagu, therefore, seem to be temporary islands surrounded by the receding waters of the flood. This meaning of nagu ('island') may also be found in three Neo-Assyrian passages. In parallel passages from the inscriptions of Assurbanipal, the newly discovered land of Lydia is described as anagu across the sea:
out of the sea drawn from a frontal view, rather than regions in the sea that are drawn from a bird's-eye view. 13 For the reading Nimus, see W. G. Lambert, RA 80 185-86.

The nagu on the World Map may also be islands, because they lie across the sea from the continent. Yet, this cannot be certain, since two sides of the nagu extend into an uncharted area. This uncharted space could represent a body of water, such as a portion of the tamtu beyond the marratu, the Apsu, or
even the me midi 'waters of death' referred to in Gilg. X (see p. 103). However, it is also possible that this terra incognita is a distant land mass, or that the nagu extend over the far edge of the earth's surface. In the later case, a traveler crossing over the sides of the nagu beyond the cosmic ocean might fall directly into the Apsu or underworld.
The Northern nagu (no. 18). The northern nagu (no. 18) is identified as 'Great Wall ... where the Sun is not seen'. This identification is obscure. 'Great Wall' may literally refer to an actual cosmic wall separating this nagu from some other cosmic region, or perhaps figuratively to a 'wall of mountains' located in part or all of the nagu. In Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions, high city walls are often compared to mountains, so it is not impossible that Babylonians might likewise have thought of high mountains as a wall. 15

The Text on the Obverse 33
Two possible explanations for the statement that the Sun is not seen in this region also come to mind. First, the northern nagu may be a region of perpetual darkness. Comparable dark regions are found in Gilg. IX iv-v, where Gilgamesh follows the aarran dsamsi 'Path of the Sun' through total blackness, and in literary traditions concerning Sargon of Akkad. For instance, Sargon of Akkad traverses a dark region in an omen apodosis: 16
... a-mu-ut rsar-ru1-ki-in sa ek-le-tam ikli-ku-ma nu-ru-um
u-$i-as-su-um V Scheil, RA 27149:16-17
... the omen of Sargon, who went through the darkness and a light came out for him.
Second, the missing northern nagu may be called 'a place where the Sun is not seen' because the Sun, when viewed from the latitude of Mesopotamia, never passes through the northern portion of the sky. North of the tropic of cancer, the Sun describes an arc in the southern sky throughout the entire year,l7 Thus, some Babylonians might have believed that the Sun never reached the northern skies because of the 'Great Wall'. In this case, however, the northern nagu need not necessarily be a land of everlasting night since sunlight could have entered the nagu from the south.
The Text on the Obverse
The obverse preserves eleven lines of text. This text is difficult to interpret because the beginnings and ends of each line are missing and the opening portion of the obverse is almost completely lost. Nevertheless, a general concern with distant places and early times is discernible.
Obverse 1'-2'
The first two lines yield only the single phrase alanu abtutu 'ruined cities'. The adjective abtu, when applied to buildings, refers to old buildings that have fallen into disrepair (CAD All 67). Thus the 'ruined cities', as noted earlier, could be the ruins of. uninhabited ancient sites that could no longer be identified by name, such as the ovals labeled uru 'city' on the map (nos. 2, 11).
Obverse 3'-9'
Lines 3'-9' provide information relating to the earliest of times, the era of creation. Lines 3'-4' parallel passages in Enuma Elish. The ruined gods in the sea in line 4' are probably to be identified with the creatures of Tiamat that

34 "The Babylonian Map of the World"
Marduk defeats in Enuma Elish. In Ee VI 151-54, Marduk is praised by the name Asallubi-Namtila and hailed as the savior of these godS: 18
dasal-lu-hi dnam-ti-la sa-nis im-bu-u ilu mus-nes-su
. sa ki-ma~bi-nu-ti-su-ma ik-si-ru ka-lu ilani ab-tu-ti

Ee VI 151-54
Asarlubi-Namtila, secondly they named him, the healing god, who mended all the ruined gods in accordance with its (the name's) structure.
The Lord, who gave life to the dead gods by his holy incantation, who destroys wicked enemies, let us praise (him).
In an inscription of Sennacherib listing elements of a relief depicting the battle in which Assur replaces Marduk, creatures of Tiamat are said to be inside the goddess, just as the 'ruined gods' are inside the sea in obv. 4':
[ti]-amat a-di nab-nit qer-bi-su
Meissner-Rost Senn. pI. 16 edge 2 (OIP 2 142 b 2) (cf. OIP 2140:10-12)
[Ti]amat together with the creatures inside her.
An analogous tradition is preserved in The Babyloniaca of Berossus. Here, creatures are placed inside primeval water, which is later identified with the waters of the primeval Sea-goddess:
They say there was a time when everything was darkness and water, within which monstruous beings lived, which were born alive hav
ing strange forms.
F. Jacoby, FGrH 3/1 p. 370(6); (Burstein Berossus 14 2.1)
Later, Marduk defeats the sea and splits it in half. Thus the sea in Berossus is to be identified with Tiamat, whom Marduk divides into two parts in Ee
IV 137-38. Line three mentions Marduk and a bridge. This line can be compared with Ee VII 74-75, where Marduk as dsirsir crosses the sea during battle as if crossing a bridge:
sa ti-amat rapastata i-ti-ib-bi-ru uz-zu-us-su ki-i ti-tur-ri i-ti-it-ti-qu a-sar sa-as-me-sa
who crossed the broad sea in his fury, passed over its place of battle as if on a bridge.
Ee VII 74-75
Lines 5-9 list animals, beasts, and fantastic creatures. These beings are divided into two groups. As preserved, the first group consists of only two
18 Cf. Erra HIe 32: ki sa ila ab !(=*BA)-ta. ...
The Text on the Obverse 35
beings, the basrnu 'viper' and mustwssu rabu 'great sea-serpent', which live ina libbi 'inside', presumably inside the sea. Mythological basmu and mus/yussu are placed inside the sea in other works. Angimdimma 139 (Cooper Angim 80) compares a mace with the mus/yussu of the sea (mus.bus a.ab.ba = mus/yus tamtim), and the Labbu myth speaks of a 60-league-Iong fantastic basmu that was created in the sea:
i-na tamti(a.ab.ba) ib-ba-ni musba-[as-mu] 1 su-si beru(danna) sa-kin u-rak-[su]
KAR 6 21'-22' (cf. CT 13 33:5-12) 19
In the sea the vi[per] was created. [His] length was set at 60 leagues.
The remaining beings are explained in line 9' as 'beasts which Marduk created on top of the restless sea'. This group consists of the the anzu 'fabulous eagle or winged horse',2o girtablullu 'scorpion-man', armu 'gazelle', $ab'itu 'gazelle', apsasu 'zebu, water buffalo',21 nimru 'panther', kusarikku 'bull-man', nesu 'lion', barbaru 'wolf', lulimu 'red-deer', bU$u 'hyena', pagu 'monkey', pagitu 'femalemonkey', tura/yu'ibex', lurmu 'ostrich', suranu 'cat', and /yurbabillu 'chameleon'. The statement that Marduk creates these animals 'on top of the sea' may be compared with the account of the creation of animals in The Bilingual Account of the Creation of the World by Marduk (CT 13 35-37 + dupl.). In this text, Marduk creates dry land on top of the sea by building a (reed-)raft (gidiri = amu) and pouring out dirt (CT 13 36:17-18). Then, in lines 20-22, Marduk creates mankind and the animals on dry land on top of the raft, which floats on the sea. Thus, in terms of the map, the two groups of animals may represent the sea-animals that inhabit the marratu and the animals that live above the sea on the continent and the nagu. On the reverse of the tablet (rev. 21'-23'), horned cattle run about on the seventh nagu. With the exception of the cat, all of the beings listed in lines 5'-8' were not common in Mesopotamia cities, although they were familiar to Mesopotamians from depictions and statues, literary works, and military campaigns in distant lands. For example, representations of the mus/yussu, apsasu, anzu, kusarikku, lion, ape, and monkey adorned the public buildings of Babylonia and Assyria;22 Assyrian kings brought home hyenas, panthers, red-deer, lions,
19 For the Labbu myth, see T. Lewis, JAOS ll6 (1996) 28-47. 20 For the anzu as winged horses in first-millennium materials, note KAR 307:25 (see SAA 3 100), where horses hitched to a chariot are mystically identified with anzu, and AfO 19 107:21, where the anzu-star is identified with the "Horse-star." Cf. A. George, RA 85 157 n. 122. 21 In the third millennium, at least, the apsasu (Sumerian ab.za.za) is a real animal that was imported to Mesopotamia from afar (Cooper Curse of Agade 50:21) and is
probably to be identified with the Indian water buffalo (see R. M. Boehmer ZA 64 11-13) or the Indian zebu-bulL First-millennium apsasu, on the other hand, are mythological composite creatures that are often represented in palace reliefs (see CAD A/2 193-94), 22 Note for example, AKA 146:16-147:19; Borger Esarh. 61 15-21,87 rev. 4; Rost

monkeys, ostriches, and gazelles with them from their campaigns;23 and the basmu, musl:Jussu, girtablullu, and kusarikku are listed among the eleven creatures of Tiamat in Enuma Elish (Ee I 141-46). These beings may have been considered the fauna of distant lands, and as such would have provided a tangible link with the faraway places on the map.24
Obverse 10'
Line 10' continues the theme of distant lands and distant times, but is concerned with human beings rather than animals. The line lists three famous figures from the third millennium who are associated with far-away places: UtnapiStim, Sargon of Akkad, and Nur-Dagan. The first, Utnapistim, is the wellknown hero of the flood story that is incorporated into tablet eleven of The Gilgamesh Epic. In this account of the flood, Utnapistim is settled in the distant locale ina pi narati 'at the source of the rivers' as a reward for saving the human race (Gilg. XI 193-98). In the Sumerian flood story, the hero Ziusudra is settled in Dilmun (Lambert-Millard Atra-hasis 144:258-60). Both the home of Utnapistim and Dilmun (modern Bahrain), like the nagu, are located across the sea from Mesopotamia. The second figure, Sargon of Akkad, is the famous third-millennium king who was remembered as a conqueror of the entire world. In terms of the World Map, the empire of Sargon of Akkad would have included the entire central continent as well as the nagu across the marratu. The third figure, Nur-Dagan, the king of BursalJanda, is the antagonist of Sargon of Akkad in The Sar Taml:Jari Epic. The Amarna version of the epic (VS 12 193; EA 359) describes the long and arduous journey from Akkad to far
away Bursahanda.25

underworld wear birdlike garments. However, the flood hero Utnapistim, who is granted eternal life, should not be placed in the underworld. If the phrase does not describe the heroes, it may refer back to a statement
in the broken opening lines of the obverse. In this case, 'f... w]ings like a bird' could explain that the world map offers a view of the earth's surface that only birds or passengers on birds' wings could have seen. One such passenger could have been another third-millennium hero, Etana, who flies up into heaven on the back of an eagle in The Etana Epic. The possibility that obv. 11' refers back to the broken opening section finds support in the closing phrase manma qerebsina ul i [du]. This phrase includes a suffix that has no antecedent in the surviving text. It is possible that this missing antecedent is kibrat erbetti ('four quadrants of the earth's surface'), because the closing phrase of the obverse is repeated almost verbatim in rev. 27' after kibrat erbetti in rev. 26'.
The Text on the Reverse
The reverse is divided into nine sections comprising 27 lines of text. Sections two through eight contain standardized descriptions of the second through eighth nagu. Each section opens with an introductory line that identifies the nagu by number and assigns a distance of seven leagues to the nagu with the phrase asar tallaku 'where you go'. A short passage describing the nagu then follows. These descriptions are limited to one or two lines, with the exception of the description of the fifth nagu, whiclioccupies eight lines. Only the descriptions of the third, fifth, seventh, and eighth nagu are even partially intelligible, due to breaks in the text. The first and ninth sections of the reverse do not describe nagu. The first section is almost completely lost, but the surviving traces suggest that it introduced the reverse and explained how to identify the first nagu. The word tabrati 'wonders' may be preserved in rev. 2'. The following deSCriptions of the nagu relate wondrous features, while rev. 3' 'great s[ea?' could refer to the cosmic ocean marratu on the map. Line 4', which may preserve the phrase ina erebfsu 'when he enters if, could have explained how to enter the map at the first nagu. Without an introduction of this sort, it is impossible to correlate the nagu on the map with the descriptions on the reverse. The ninth section (rev. 26'-27') apparently provides a summary of the reverse. This section refers to the kibrat erbetti 'four quadrants' (of the earth's surface).
The Third nagu (rev. 7'-8')
The third nagu is described in rev. 8' as a place that winged birds cannot reach. This nagu may be a distant desert or a mountainous region. The inscriptions of Assurbanipal describe the desert area of Hararina and Ayalla as "a



38 "The Babylonian Map of the World"
place where there are no steppe animals and the bird of he~ven does not estab
lish a nest" (Streck Asb. 70:87-88). In the inscriptions of Samsi-Adad V, three mountains in Na"iri are described as "hanging from heaven like a cloud which winged birds cannot pass" (I R 30 ii 47-49).26
The Fifth nagu (rev. 11 '-18')
The description of the fifth nagu is by far the longest, but it is difficult to interpret due to the poor preservation of the tablet. Two possible interpretations of the fifth nagu derive from the ambigous writings MI.LD and ZI.ND in
rev. 12' and 13'. First, the nagu may be a region of wondrous trees. If the word MI.LD is interpreted as meW 'height', then line 12' may explain that the nagu contained tall trees. Elsewhere, distant lands are noted for their unusual trees. Gilgamesh visits a grove of stone-bearing trees in Gilg. IX v-vi, and the Sumer
ian epic Gilgamesh and the Cedar Forest speaks of a larger-than-life forest. 27 If MI.LD refers to the height of trees, then ZI.ND in rev. 13' can represent the word zinu 'date frond', and damlsu'its blood' in rev. 14' can refer to the sap of the tree, since tree sap as well as animal blood is called damu. For instance, in Summa-Alu, a felled date-palm sheds its "blood":
summa gisgisimmara sap-lis tak-ki-is-ma da-mi iq-qi . ..
CT 41 19:12 (cf. CAD D 79 damu d)
If you cut a date-palm down and it sheds sap ...
Further support for the identification of the fift~ nagu as a region of trees is found in rev. 16' "Youll go seven leagues." In The Sar TamlJari Epic, the road to Bursaganda is blocked by a seven-league region of forested mountains (VS 12 193:28-32). A possible verbal form, nillu 'which we climb', in rev. 15' may then refer to an ascent of tree-covered mountains or an attempt to climb the fantastic trees themselves. 28 Second, the nagu may be a region of high rainfall and flooding, because MI.LD could represent milu 'flood' and ZI.ND could represent zinnu 'rain'. It is difficult, however, to explain damu in this context.29 The only clues that might help identify MI.LD and ZI.ND are the figures of 840 cubits and 120 cubits in rev. 12'-13'. These measurements, however, probably belong to the missing second halves of the lines, rather than to MI.LD and ZI.ND.

204:11-12,31-32; TCL 316:98; E. Weidner, AfO 6 82:30.
27 For Gilgamesh and the Cedar Forest, see A. Shaffer, JAOS 103 307-1l.
28 Note also the seven mountains that Gilgamesh crosses in Gilgamesh and the Ce
dar Forest and the seven mountains that Lugalbanda crosses in Lugalb. 122:344.
29 Another possibility for rev. 15' is [us]nillu '[they l]aid (the dead) to rest' (see
CAD Nil 206); this might be in some way related to 'blood' in rev. 14'. A further possi
bility would be to emend rev. 14' mi-lam!-mi-su ul im-mar'its (the Sun's) shine he does
not see' and speculate that the fifth nagil is a region of darkness (for mi-lam-mu as the
glow of the Sun, see BWL 126:11); in this case, the fifth nagil might be identified with
the northern nagil on the map.
The Text on the Reverse 39
The Seventh nagu (rev. 21 '-23')
The seventh nagu is described as the home of horned cattle. Horned cattle may have been included among the fauna of distant lands, together with many of the animals on the obverse. It is probable that rev. 23' 'move fast and reach' describes the horned cattle, although there may be room for a change of subject at the end of rev. 22'.
The Eighth nagu (rev. 24'-25~
The eighth nagu may be located in the far east, where the Sun rises. The verb in line 24', ti-se-J-ru, may be understood as a third-person feminine subjunctive present-future of scru 'to rise early', with an incorrect prefix ti/te9 for Babylonian dialect tao A reading te9 provides a possible Assyrian form, but the World Map is a Babylonian text (and copy). The noun lJanduru may refer to a gate of sunrise at the eastern end of the earth's surface, or to part of such a gate. The Sun, Moon, and stars often enter and leave the sky through heavenly gates (see pp. 265-67). Evidence associating lJanduru with gates is found in the inscriptions of Sennacherib and lexical lists. In a Sennacherib inscription, one of the western gates of Nineveh is named abullJanduri:
dsar-ur4 mu-sam-qit a-a-ab sarri abullJa-an-du-u-ri
CT 26 32 viii 3 (OIP 2 113)
"Sarur, destroyer of the enemy of the king;' (is the name of) the lJanduru-gate.
In both Malku II and Explicit Malku III (ZA 43240:170; CT 18 3 ii 17), a near homonyn anduru is equated with daltu (door).3o However, there is no proof that anduru and lJanduru are related, and lJanduru in the gate-name may have nothing to do with the gate itself. Without the missing first part of the line, it is not possible to determine if su in lJandurisu refers back to the eighth nagu or to a different antecedent. Likewise, the last word u/sam-[x-xj may be a II- or III-stem main verb or a noun acting as the subject of tiscru. 31
The Ninth Section (rev. 26'-2n
Reverse 26' refers to the kibrat erbetti 'four quadrants' of the earth's surface, but the complete phrase is missing due to a break. Peiser's early copy
30 The phonetic switch of a to l:J in opening syllables also occurs in words such as

translation "where the sun-disk dawns at its entrance." For samsatu in astronomical con

shows a full HI sign (..6~J after kal, instead of the single stroke (X) now preserved at the end of the line. This HI can be read sar or taken as the first half of 1M, allowing for three possible restorations:
· .. kib-rat er-bet-ti sa kal kissati(sar)
· .. four quadrants of the entire universe.
· .. kib-rat er-bet-ti sa kal sa[re](I[M)mes] ... four quadrants of all the wi[nds.]
· .. kib-rat er-bet-ti sa kal sa[r erbetti] ... four quadrants of all fo[ur winds.]
Parallel passages where the 'four winds' refer to the entire earth's surface are found in Shamash Hymn 151-52 and The Tukulti-Ninurta Epic (Machinist TN
Epic 66 LA 13'). Reverse 27' preserves the phrase qerebsina manma la idil 'which no one can comprehend'. The suffix sina here, as noted earlier, apparently refers back to kibrat erbetti in rev. 26'. Thus the closing section of the text seems to explain that the earth's surface extends for an incomprehensible distance to the north, south, east, and west of Babylonia.
The Babylonian Map of the World and Distant Places
The emphasis on distant places in the texts accompanying the map sug. gests that the purpose of BM 92687 was to locate and describe distant regions. The map illustrated where these distant areas were located in relation to familiar locales, such as Babylon, Assyria, and the Euphrates. The obverse related these distant places to familiar literary figures and exotic animals, and the reverse described conditions in the far-away regions. The ancient author's interest in distant places reflects a general interest in distant areas during the first half of the first millennium, when the Assyrian and Babylonian empires reached their greatest extents. Other manifestations of this interest include the construction of kirimal:J,u 'botanical gardens', filled with the flora of distant lands in Assyria during the reigns of Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Assurbanipal;32 the aforementioned expedition of Shalmaneser III to the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates (Layard ICC 92: 92-93); and the writing of The Sargon Geography, a text purporting to describe the worldwide empire of Sargon of Akkad-all during this same period (see pp. 92-93).

Greek Maps and Babylonian Geometry 41
rable maps during the middle of the first millennium. Herodotus (Book IV 36 of his history) refers to circular world maps before providing his own description of the inhabited world:
I laugh when I see so many men drawing maps of the Earth, as none till now have drawn reasonably, for they draw Oceanus flowing in a circle around the Earth as if drawn with a compass making Asia equal to Europe, but I myself will explain how big each of them is and how to draw them.
Unfortunately, none of the Greek maps dismissed by Herodotus have survived. One map that Herodotus may have seen was the map of Anaximander (610540), a disciple of Thales. This map and similar antique maps are discussed by the fourth century B.C.E. geographer Agathemenus:
Anaximander, the Milesian, the disciple of Thales, was the first to draw the inhabited world on a tablet ... and the ancients drew the inhabited world as round and Greece lay in the middle, and Delphi (lay) in the middle of it for it is the umbilicus of the Earth ... and swift flowing Oceanus completed a circle around the Earth. C. Muller, Geographi Graeci Minores II 471-7233
Both the Greek maps described by Herodotus and Anaximander and the Babylonian map on BM 92687 share a belief that the inhabited world was surrounded by water. In Greece, the cosmic ocean Oceanus, like the marratu on BM 92687, was believed to encircle the continental portion of the earth's surface. Both Homer and Hesiod indicate that Oceanus surrounded the inhabited world, and Strabo in Book I.l: 8 of his geography explicitly states that the inhab
ited world is an island encircled by Oceanus.34 In Mesopotamian literature, one finds a parallel tradition in The Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk (CT 13 35-37), which states that Marduk created dry land on a raft floating upon and surrounded by the cosmic sea (see pp. 130-31). Nonetheless, BM 92687 does not fully agree with the Greek traditions. First, the compass point at the center of the Greek maps is identified as Delphi, while the compass point on the Babylonian map is unlabeled. The city of Babylon is drawn as a rectangle above the compass point and thus cannot be considered the umbilicus of the Babylonian world. 35 Second, the Greek maps do not include any land areas beyond Oceanus that can be compared with the nagu on the Babylonian map. Another similarity between the Babylonian and Greek maps is the shared use of geometric shapes to represent topographic features. In the map of
33 Another early Greek map was the map that Aristagorous of Miletus brings to Sparta in Herodotus V:49. This map consists of "the entire world, entire sea, all the rivers" drawn on a bronze tablet. Later Greek world maps include the third century B.C.E. map of Eratosthenes that is described by Strabo (Book II.l 1); and the second century C.E. maps of Marinus of Tyre and Claudius Ptolemy (see E. L. Stevenson, ed., Geography of Claudius Ptolemy, The New York Public Library, New York, 1932). 34 Homer Iliad XVIII 607-8, XXI 195-96; Odyssey XI 13, XXIV 11-12; Hesiod Theogony 789-91; Shield of Heracles 314. See also Strabo Book I.l 3, where the geographer notes that Homer indicated that Oceanus encircled the inhabited world. 35 The indentification of Nippur and Babylon as 'bonds of heaven and earth' (dur. an.ki = markas same u er$eti) is never explicitly interpreted in Mesopotamian texts to mean that the cities are placed at the exact center of the earth's surface.



42 "The Babylonian Map of the World"
Anaximander, two concentric circles and the compass point represent the general outline of the earth's surface, with Delphi in the middle. On the Babylonian world map, various standard geometric shapes, including the kippatu 'circle', santakku 'triangle', naru 'river', nalbattu 'brick mold' (no. 13) and ini alpi 'eye of an ox' (no. 1)36 represent the various features of the earth's surface. These shapes are also found on BM 15285 (RA 54 132-33), an Old Babylonian tablet illustrating geometric problems, so it apppears that the author of the Babylonian world map was well versed in geometry. Two other Mesopotamian mathematical texts even include illustrations that are similar in design to the sketch on the world map. Bohl Collection 1821 (W, Leemans, CRRA1 2 31-35; A. Kilmer, Studies Oppenheim 142-43) presents a geometric problem concerned with a new residential area ringing an older city center. This problem is illustrated by two concentric circles, just as the continent and marratu, without the nagu, appear as two concentric circles on the map. A second text, BM 85194 i 37-52 (MKT II pI. 5; Studies Oppenheim 144) preserves three concentric circles that illustrate a geometric problem concerned with the area of a city ringed by a ditch and a dike. Another mathematical text even includes the geometric shape "circle in a circle" in a list of standard geometric functions:
ki-pa-tam i-na li-bu kip-pa-tim e-pe-sa-am ki-pa-t[am] ral-na si-na at-he za-za-am e-pe-sa-am i-na li-bu na-al-ba-tim ki-pa-ta-am i-na li-bu ki-pa-tim na-al-ba-ta-am
1M 52916 rev. 18-21 (Sumer 7, third plate following p. 154)
To make a circle inside a circle. To make the division of circle into two equal parts. (To make) a circle inside a brick-mold. (To make) a brick-mold inside a circle.
Furthermore, the map and text on the reverse are similar in format to geometric problems that consist of diagrams and second-person procedural instructions. The map can be considered a diagram, and the text on the reverse repeats the phrase asar tallaku 'where you go'. Thus it is possible that geometric conventions, as well as cosmographic traditions, influenced the development of The Babylonian Map of the World.
36 For the geometric shape 'eye of an ox', see Sumer 7137:12. The shape of the re
gion labeled mountain on the world map (no. 1) is identical to the shape of ox eyes on
reliefs such as those in R. D. Barnett, Assyrian Palace Reliefs, pI. 36.

The Flights of Etana and the Eagle
into the Heavens
Introduction
The Etana Epic tells the story of Etana, a king of Kish, who is described in The Sumerian King List as sipa lu an.se ba.ell.de 16 kur.kur mU.un. gi.na 'a shepherd who ascended to heaven, who organized the lands' (AS 11 80:16-18),1 an eagle, and a snake. Near the end of the preserved portion of the text, Etana and the eagle fly up into heaven. The account of their flight provides information concerning the geography of the heavens and the appearance of the earth's surface when viewed from above. The Etana Epic is known from Old Babylonian recensions, from both Babylonia and Susa, and from Middle-Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian recensions.2
1 This same tradition is also known from the bilingual myth of the "Seven Sages" (E. Reiner, Or n.s. 30 2:1'-4'); the Late Babylonian omen BRM 4 13:33: summa(BE)
tfranu(sa.nigin) kima(gim) eri (tig)musen amat(BA)ut de-ta-na sarru sa ana same e
elu (euJ U 'If the "coil" is like an eagle, it is the omen of Etana, the king who ascended to heaven'; and a passage in a poem about early rulers where Etana is identified as Entena:
[me j.e men. te.n[a Iuj gal.e Iu an.se bi.in.e.de (Sumerian Version) B. Alster, ASJ 8 4 B II 4; Emar 767: 12

a-le-e m[e-ta-nja sa [a-na same e e-lu-uj
(Bilingual Version) Emar 767:12 Where is Etana, the king, who ascended to heaven?
The poem about early rulers is at least as old as the Old Babylonian period (see M. Civil, Aula Orientalis 7 7 no. 767). For an etymology of the name of Etana, 'he who went up to
heaven', see AS 11 80-81. 2 For the Akkadian "Series of Etana" in literary catalogues, see W,e. Lambert, JCS
16 66 VI 11; Kramer AV 314 K. 13684+ 5; Bezold Cat. 1627 20. Although no Sumerian examples of Etana have been identified, the story of Etana and the Eagle's flight to heaven, at least, must have circulated in the third millennium, because Etana's ascent to heaven is recorded in The Sumerian King List, and a hero (probably Etana) is drawn on an eagle's back in Old Akkadian cylinder seals (see n. 20).

For example, according to this model, at the winter solstice, the Sun would be visible above the horizon for only one-third of its path (2,OUS = 120°),but invisible below the horizon for two-thirds of its path (4,O US = 240").At this time, circumpolar stars would be visible at night for two-thirds of their path at the winter solstice, but only one-third of their path at the summer solstice.61It is not clear, however, how the mechanics of such a system would have worked.

The diagram on BagM. Beih. 2 no. 98 seems to correlate the positions of the four winds, the locations of sunrise and sunset, and the seasons of the year. The area within the square preserves two triangles that are labeled "Southw i n d (no. 1) and 'Westwind (no. 3), with the space between them labeled "Sunrise" (no.2). Based on this pattern, it may be surmised that the missing half of the square preserved triangles labeled "Northwind" (no. 9) and "Eastwind (no.7), with the space between these triangles labeled "Sunset" (no. 8). Along the sides of the square, between the square and the circle, two short inscriptions are preserved. Periods of approximately three months are listed, with what appear to be names or descriptions of winds. One side deals with the period from Adar to Sivan, which is the spring season (no. 4), and the second
Winds and Compass Point Directions i n Ancient Mesopotamia 195
side deals with the period from Sivan to Elul, which is summer (no. 5).l Thus each side of the square apparently represents one of the four seasons, and each season is assigned a characteristic wind. Traces of a sign (no. 6) are also found beyond the circle that encloses the square. The significance of the diagram is difficult to determine. No accompanying explanatory text, such as that found with the World Map, is available, and it is not certain how much of the text is missing, because the flake does not preserve any edge or provide an indication of the thickness of the original tablet. It is not even certain where the top of the diagram is. The surviving text is symmetrical, with the bases of all signs drawn toward the center of the diagram. Thus, the diagram in its present form has no top or bottom. Furthermore, the diagram need not be aligned according to the north-south axis used on most modern maps; there is no such convention in ancient maps. For example, the Map of the World and a late third-millennium map of Nippur (S. N. Kramer FTS2 274) are drawn along axes following the course of the Euphrates, and an Old Akkadianperiod map from Nuzi (HSS 10 1) is drawn with "westwind at the b ~ t t o m . ~ Despite these uncertainties, it seems likely that the diagram was meant to correlate at least two sets of variables: those placed inside the square (sunrise, sunset, north, south, east, and west winds), and those placed outside the square (the seasons of the year, with their characteristic winds).Before examining this hypothesis further, it is first necessary to consider how ancient Mesopotamians identified the four compass-point directions and to examine BagM Beih. 2 no. 98 in greater detail.
Winds and Compass Point Directions in Ancient Mesopotamia
Ancient Mesopotamians possessed no reliable method for determining due north, south, east, and west.

The diagram on BagM. Beih. 2 no. 98 seems to correlate the positions of
the four wi~ds,. the locations of sunrise and sunset, and the seasons of the year. The area wühm the square preserves two triangles that are labeled "Southwind" (no. 1) and "Westwind" (no. 3), with the space between them labeled "Sunrise" (no. 2). Based on this pattern, it may be surmised that the missing half of the square preserved triangles labeled "Northwind" (no. 9) and "Eastwind"
(no. ~), with the space between these triangles labeled "Sunset" (no. 8). Along t?e sldes of the square, between the square and the circle, two short inscriphons are preserved. Periods of approximately three months are listed, with what appear to be names or descriptions of winds. One side deals with the period from Adar to Sivan, which is the spring season (no. 4), and the second
Winds and Compass Point Directions in Ancient Mesopotamia 195
side deals with the period from Sivan to EluI, which is summer (no. 5).1 Thus each side of the square apparently represents one of the four seasons, and each season is assigned a characteristic wind. Traces of a sign (no. 6) are also found beyond the circle that encloses the square. The significance of the diagram is difficult to determine. No accompanying explanatory text, such as that found with the World Map, is available, and it is not certain how much of the text is missing, because the flake does not preserve any edge or provide an indication of the thickness of the original tablet. It is not even certain where the top of the diagram iso The surviving text is symmetrical, with the bases of all signs drawn toward the center of the diagram. Thus, the diagram in its present form has no top or bottom. Furthermore, the diagram need not be aligned according to the north-south axis used on most modern maps; there is no such convention in ancient maps. For example, the Map of the World and a late third-millennium map of Nippur (S. N. Kramer FTS2 274) are drawn along axes following the course of the Euphrates, and an Old Akkadian
period map from Nuzi (HSS 10 1) is drawn with "westwind" at the bottom.2 Despite these uncertainties, it seems likely that the diagram was meant to correlate at least two sets of variables: those placed inside the square (sunrise, sunset, north, south, east, and west winds), and those placed outside the square (the seasons of the year, with their characteristic winds). Before examining this hypothesis further, it is first necessary to consider how ancient Mesopotamians identified the four compass-point directions and to examine BagM Beih. 2 no. 98 in greater detail.
Winds and Compass Point Directions in Ancient Mesopotamia
Ancient Mesopotamians possessed no reliable method for determining due north, south, east, and west. Modern compasses were not invented until approximately 1000 GE., and the modern North Star (Polaris) was more than 12° south of due north during antiquity.3 Therefore, other less reliable indicators were used to determine the approximate locations of the four compass points. These indicators included the Sun, winds, and stars.
1 The total number of days in No. 4, from the 14th of Adar to the 5th of Sivan, is 80 days in an ideal 360-day calendar of twelve 30-day months. No reason for aperiod of 80 days is clear, but the number of days in No. 4 may be compared with aperiod of 160
days (twice 80) in a first-millennium religious-mystical text (see Livingstone 256-57 BM 34035 50-53 and cf. ibid., 255 BM 34035 1-8).

The Sun
Numerous Sumerian and Akkadian texts use the terms "sunrise" and "sunset" as terms for "east" and " w e ~ t "T. ~his is not surprising, because the sun rises each day in the east and sets in the west, but only on the first days of Spring and Autumn does the sun actually rise and set due east and west. During the Spring and Summer months, the sun actually rises and sets north of due east and west. Conversely, in the Autumn and Winter, the sun rises and sets south of due east and west. The maximum deviation of the locations of sunrise and sunset from due east and west occurs at the Summer and Winter solstices.At the latitude of Babylon, the Sun appears to rise and set approximately 30" north of due east on the first day of Summer, and 30" south of due east on the first day of Winter.5

These variations were recognized by Mesopotamian astronomers.

The Winds
The northwest-southeast mountain ranges east of Iraq influence the winds of Mesopotamia As a result, the prevailing winds are northwest and southeast winds, rather than true north, south, east, and west winds. Ancient Mesopotamians, like ourselves, recognized four primary winds (north, south, east, and west), and assigned the names of the four winds to the four compass points.

The name of the east wind, IMkur.ra 'mountain wind' refers to the mountains east and northeast of Mesopotamia. west wind, IMm ar. d U, bears the name of the Amorites, who arrived in Mesopotamiafrom west in the third millennium.6 In Akkadian, the namescof these two winds, IMsadil and IMarnurru, are exaet equivalents of the Sumerian names.

The common south wind in southern Mesopotamia is a calm southeast wind, but a strong, violent southwest suhaili wind also occurs, bringing clouds, rain, and fog in its wake. This southwest wind from the gulf poses a danger to small craft on the Persian Gulf, such as the boat of Adapa. Thus Siitu '(ancient) south' must include modern southwest or be equivalent to modern southwest.* As of yet, no ancient device to determine the directions of winds has been identified. However, an obscure passage from "The Fable of the Willow" may refer to a weather vane of some sort that was placed on roofs or aboard ships:

The Stars
Although no single star, such as the modern pole-star Polaris, served as an indicator of the compass-point directions in ancient Mesopotamia, it is clear that Mesopotamians did use combinations of stars and constellations to determine the locations of north, south, east, and west. One section of Mul-Apin I1 even explains how to determine all four compass points by observing the stars:

68. In order for you to observe the departure of the winds: Ursa Major lies across the rising of the north wind, 69. Piscis Austrinus lies across the rising of the south wind, Scorpio lies across the rising of the west wind, 70. Perseus and the Pleiades stand at the rising of the east wind, 71. on the day of your observation, the stars will tell you which wind is blowing.
The correlations between stars and winds in this passage are reasonably accurate. Ursa Major is a northern star, Piscis Austrinus is a southern star, and Scorpio and the Pleiades are said to be located across from each other at the eastern and western ends of heaven in Mul-Apin I:
mul.mul inappah(kur)-ma""'gir. t a b ir~bbi(S6)~' ""'gir.tab inappab(kur)-mamul.mu1 ir~bbi(S6)~' Mul-Apin I iii 13-14 (Hunger Pingree Mul-Apin 47)
The Pleiades rise when Scorpio sets. Scorpio rises when the Pleiades set.
Thus for a time each year, the Pleiades would rise at the eastern horizon while Scorpio was setting at the western horizon, when Ursa Major and Piscis Austrinus were to be found in the northern and southern quadrants of the sky MulApin I identifies this time of year as the beginning of Iyar:
ina ituaiari(gu,) u, 1kam mu 1.mu 1innammar (igi .18) Mul-Apin I ii 38 (Hunger Pingree Mul-Apin 40)
On the 1st of Iyar, the Pleiades are seen.
The first of Iyar occurs just after the Spring equinox on the 15th of Nisan in Mul-Apin (see Mul-Apin I1 i 19-21), so sunrise and sunset on this day would be very close to due east and west. Nevertheless, west in Mul-Apin I1 i 69 seems to be southwest rather than due west, because Scorpio is an Ea-star (southern star) in Mul-Apin I ii 29 rather than an equatorial Anu-star, as is the Pleiades in Mul-Apin I i 44. This demonstrates that "west:' as well as "south (as in Adapa), includes southwest. Thus, as E. Weidner recognized in AfO 7 271, each compass-point direction in Mesopotamia included a range of 90°, with "north including areas from northeast to northwest, "south areas from southeast to southwest, "east" areas from northeast to southeast, and "west" areas from northwest to southwest (see diagram, p. 200).11

Perseus and the Pleiades stand at the rising of the east wind, 71. on the day of your observation, the stars will tell you which wind is blowing. The correlations between stars and winds in this passage are reasonably accurate. Ursa Major is a northern star, Piscis Austrinus is a southern star, and Scorpio and the Pleiades are said to be located across from each other at the eastern and western ends of heaven in Mul-Apin 1:
mul.mul inappal;(kur)-ma mUlgir.tab irabbi(su)bi mUlgir.tab inappal; (ku r)-ma mul.mul irabbi(su)bi
Mul-Apin I iii 13-14 (Hunger Pingree Mul-Apin 47)
The Pleiades rise when Scorpio sets. Scorpio rises when the Pleiades set.
Thus for a time each year, the Pleiades would rise at the eastern horizon while Scorpio was setting at the western horizon, when Ursa Major and Piscis Austrinus were to be found in the northern and southern quadrants of the sky. MulApin I identifies this time of year as the beginning of Iyar:
ina ituaiari(gu4) u4 1kam mul.mul innammar(igi.la)
Mul-Apin I ii 38 (Hunger Pingree Mul-Apin 40)
On the 1st of Iyar, the Pleiades are seen.
The first of Iyar occurs just after the Spring equinox on the 15th of Nisan in Mul-Apin (see Mul-Apin II i 19-21), so sunrise and sunset on this day would be very close to due east and west. Nevertheless, west in Mul-Apin II i 69 seems to be southwest rather than due west, because Scorpio is an Ea-star (southern star) in Mul-Apin I ii 29 rather than an equatorial Anu-star, as is the Pleiades in Mul-Apin I i 44. This demonstrates that "west;' as weH as "south" (as in Adapa), ( includes southwest. Thus, as E. Weidner recognized in AfO 7 271, each compass-point direction in Mesopotamia included a range of 90°, with "north" including areas from northeast to northwest, "south" areas from southeast to southwest, "east" areas from northeast to southeast, and "west" areas from northwest to southwest (see diagram, p. 200).11

Topographic Features
In addition to the position of the sun, the winds, and the stars, topographic features also seem to have influenced Mesopotamian conceptions of the compass points. The name of the east wind, 'mountain wind', points to the role of the mountains in Mesopotamian conceptions of 'east'. Similarly, identifications of the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean as seas of sunrise and sunset, in p a s sages such as the following excerpt from a Sennacherib inscription, suggest that these bodies of water influenced Mesopotamian views of "east" and "west":l2

Topographie Features
In addition to the position of the sun, the winds, and the stars, topographic features also seem to have influenced Mesopotamian conceptions of the compass points.

Similarly, identifications of the Persian Gulf an~ Mediterranean as seas of sunrise and sunset, in pas"~ sages suc~ as the follo,:"mg excerpt from a Sennacherib inscription, suggest that these bodtes of water mfluenced Mesopotamian views of "east" and "west": 12

The second possibility is that BagM Beih. 2 no. 98 illustrates a device where 'sunrise' and 'sunset' can be moved independently of the triangles representing the winds. In this case, the tablet could depict an impossible placement of 'sunrise' that a user could correct, just as the arrow of a compass is meant to be turned to point toward the side labeled 'north'. For instance, the square, circle, and triangles could have been placed on separate pieces of wood that were held together by a peg, with 'sunrise' and 'sunset' attached to this same peg by thin pieces of wood, reeds, or rope. This would have allowed the square, circle, triangles, and 'sunrise' and 'sunset' to move in relation to one another. In fact, the "impossible" placement of sunrise and sunset in the west and east on such a device might very well indicate that the elements in the square, at least, functioned as a rudimentary sundial of some sort, where the morning shadow at sunrise fell to the west and evening shadow at sunset fell to the east.14

Neither the Spring wind in no. 4 nor the Summer wind in no. 5 can be positively identified.15The first signs in the wind-name in no. 5 may be read either 4kamor ZA-x. In the former case, the wind-name almost certainly represents 'west wind' (amurru),because the numeral 4 is used to write amurru
I
both in lexical lists (see p. 197)and in S u m m a - ~ l aund other texts.16An identification of 'west wind' as the Summer-wind in no. 5 would be appropriate since west winds are common during the months of June, July, and August in southern Iraq.17However, it is not clear why the numeral.4 here is written limmu, (74) instead of the more common l i m m u (GAR). Other possible identifications of the wind name are even less satisfactory An identification of IM 4 as Sar erbetti (the four winds = north, south, east, and west winds) is improbable, because south and east winds are not common during the Summer months in Iraq, and no wind name, or adjective describing winds, beginning za, Sa, or sa is obvious.1s
l4 On a sundial, the seasonal variations in the location of sunrise and sunset should
require that 'sunrise' and 'sunset' be able to move independently of each other as well as the triangles represerting the 'winds' (compass points). For Mesopotamian sundials and

The wind name for the Spring (no.4),although complete, presents greater difficulties.There are two ways to understand the name. First ~I.SI.IK.TUMmay be understood as a single word. An Akkadian word SiSSiktu is known but only occurs as a name for a stone or as a topographic term (see AHw 1220).Other possible explanations of the word include a reading E r abiktim(S1.51)""" ('Wind of Destruction'), or a reading ~ I ~ ~ . ~ I ~ , .LIeGxi~ca'l"e.v~id~ence connecting sissig with winds is found in parallel passages in Urra I1 and Izi M:
i
sig.sig = Sa-a-ru 'wind' sig.sig = me-hu-G 'storm wind' sig.sig = za-qi-qu 'breeze' sig.sig = $6-qum-ma-tum 'stillness'
s ig.s ig = Sa-bur-ra-tum 'stillness' Urra I1 306-10 (MSL 5 74-75)

si.si .iq = Su-uh-ra-tu 'stillness' Izi M ii 6'-8' (MSL 13 216)
If SI.SI.IKcan be accepted as a phonetic writing for sissig, then the wind name in BagM Beih. 2 no. 98 could be this word with a feminine ending (SISSIG~~")I.f so, $aqummatum and Saburratum 'still wind' are possible readings, and this might indicate that there was little or no wind during the Spring season.However, Spring winds in Iraq are not noticeably weaker than the winds of other seasons.20 The second possible interpretation of the wind name for Summer also depends on a reading S I ~ , . S If~o~r 51.51. In the Boghazkoi version of a "Prayer to the Gods of the Nightn(KUB4 47 rev. 42),the name of the north wind is written SI,,.SI,,, which apparently is a substitute for the regular Sumerian writing si.s8 (see 6.Meier, ZA 45 197-98).Thus SI,,.SI,~alone could be a name for the north wind, and IG.TUM could represent an adjective. During the months of March, April, and May, true north winds are common in southern Iraq,21but these
north winds become less frequent during the Summer. Hence, the prevailing \ northwest wind of Mesopotamia could be thought of as a north wind during the Spring and west wind during the Summer. Unfortunately, no adjective iglklq
possible, but no other example of this word being written with g61 instead of
tum or eglklq-tum is appropriate for winds. A reading gal-tam 'terrifying' is ,

ACh Adad 33:23, where ziqiqu is identified with the north wind. A loanword ziqziqqul
siqsiqqu is equated with Siiru wind in a list of synonymns of Eru in Malku 111 (CT 18

The Area beyond the Circle
It is conceivable that the cosmic ocean lies beyond the circle preserved on BagM Beih. 2 98, because the traces in no. 6 may be interpreted as the remains of the diri-compound rD(= A.ENGUR). On The Babylonian Map of the World, the cosmic ocean is identified as the idmarratu, and this ocean flows beyond a circle marking the border of the known world. If the area beyond the circle in BagM Beih. 2 98 is also the cosmic ocean, then the relationship between this ocean and the winds may be important.

Winds blowing from Upper and Lower Seas could be the prevailing northwest and southeast winds of Mesopotamia, because the Upper Sea (Mediterranean) is located north/northwest of Assyria and Babylonia and the Lower Sea (Persian Gulf) is located southeast of Babylonia. However, the triangles labeled 'South wind' and 'West wind' on BagM Beih. 2 98 are placed weIl within the circle that may mark the shores of the cosmic sea.

The Square
Despite the difficulties outlined above, the diagram on BabM Beih. 2 98 does seem to illustrate a number of important Mesopotamian cosmographic traditions. The placement of triangles labeled 'South wind' and 'West wind' in the corners of the square seems to illustrate the tradition of the kibrät arbaJi 'four regions' in which heaven and the earth's surface are divided into northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters. The 'four regions' of the earth's surface are weIl known from historical inscriptions and literary texts, where the 'four regions' comprise the entire earth's

surface.22 The 'four regions' of heaven are less weIl known but are mentioned in connection with winds, atmospheric phenomena, and stars in astronomical omens and reports where various phenomena are located in the northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters of the sky. Examples include Mul-Apin II i 6871 (see p. 198), which correlates the four winds with constellations; Prayers to The Gods of the Night, which mention the stars of the four winds;23 and a pas
sage in Surpu that connects the four quarters of the sky with both stars and winds t
and speaks of the stars of the 'four winds' in conjunction with the 'seven winds':

This geometric figure, which may have illustrated the geographic tradition of the 'four regions', occurs on mathematical tablets (MCT 42-43, 141; MDP 34 pl. 1; cf. H. Saggs, RA 54 132).
The Circle
The circle surrounding the square seems to illustrate another Mesopotamian cosmographic concept. This circle, which encloses the square of the winds, suggests that the winds blew in a circular region, just as the circular shape of the planisphere (CT 33 10) and circular Xstrolabes" (CT 33 11-12) suggest that the level of the stars and the earth's surface were also conceived as cire8es." Further evidence for the circular shape of the region of the winds is found in a Siialmaneser 111inscription, where the weather-god Adad holds the kippat $are 'circle of the winds' (J. Kinnier Wilson, Iraq 24 93:4), and in The TukuEl-i-WjiwrtaEpic, where Tukulti-Ninurta inspires fear among the kings of kippat E r erbetti 'circle of the four winds' (Machinist TN Epic 60 LA 13'; cf.

BagM. Beih. 2 No. 98 as a n "Ancient Compass"
Evidence in BagM. Beih. 2 no. 98 suggests that the tablet diagrams a device that was used to identify the directions of the compass, as defined in ancient Mesopotamaia.Two of the three indicators of compass-point directions used in Mesopotamia (the sun and winds) are represented on the tablet by the positions of sunrise and sunset and the origins of the winds. These two compass-point directions apparently are correlated with the seasons of the year and the type of wind characteristic of each season. This is significant, because the locations of sunrise and sunset and the frequencies of winds vary over the course of the year. Furthermore, the apparent impossible placement of 'sunrise' on the tablet opens the possibility, at least, that 'sunrise' and 'sunset' could have been moved to more appropriate positions on a moveable device that may have included some elements of a sundial. The user of such a device might have been able to correlate wind direction with the location of the sun and time of year in order to determine the compass-point directions. Such a device would have been very useful, since the only attested method for determining the four compass points (that of Mul-Apin I1 i 68-71, which utilizes the positions of constellations) can

Most of the variants between versions of me.se ba.da.dal are minor. These include the omission of bar.ta.7 in BAM 508 iv 12, the omission of bar.ta. igi.7 in BM 17311 7', and the insertion of the verbal-prefix si in K.2542+ ii 37', resulting in the incipit reading me.se ba.da.si.dal. Other variants, however, are of greater consequence. BM 50958 a 4' preserves igi.na nu.gub 'before hirn it does not stand' instead of igi.m u n u.gu b 'before me it does not stand', while K.2542+ ii 38', on the other hand, apparently omits this phrase altogether. 4 Second, BM 50958 a 3' opens [EN me.se ba.d] a.ra. Here, ra may or may not be a phonetic variant of DALIRI = naprusu 'to fly'.5 The incipit me.se ba.da.dal is also found in medical texts where the recitation of the incantation is required but the fuH text is not provided,6 and in a list of medical and MussuJu incipits (F.

The verbal chain ba.da.si.dal is only found in K.2542+ ii 37' at the start of the incantation and in incipits in K.2542+ ii 30 and 35. The medical applications of two occurrences of the incantation are known. In K 2542+ the incantation is recited to alleviate paralysis (simmatu).

The Gods in TIM 9 63 6'
In TIM 9 63 6' four gods are invoked in sequence at the start of the incantation: An, Enlil, Enki, and Nergal. These gods are leading gods of their cosmic regions. In the Sumerian pantheon, An is the king of heaven, Enlil is the king of the earth's surface, and Enki is the king of the Apsu. The'god Nergal obtains the kingship of the underworld by marrying the Sumerian queen of this region, Ereskigal, in the Akkadian epic Nergal and Ereskigal.

In the incantation, an.7.bi ki.7.bLda appears as part of an opening chain of cosmographic terms. Utu is the Sumerian sun-god and be. 7. bi may be identified with the sky, because the Sumerian element be appears in Sumerian equivalents of Akkadian supuk sarn.e 'firmament, sky' (see pp. 240-41). Although this context suggests that 'seven heavens and seven earths' may be 14 cosmic regions, the editor of UGU may have understood an.7.bi ki.7.bi.da as 14 demons in heaven and earth, because 14 statuettes are used in the ritual accompanying the incantation (see AMT 103:14).

Another incantation opens with astring of nine AN signs (W. G.

Nonetheless, the mere repetition of AN and KI signs does not prove the existence of seven, nine, or more heavens and earths. In Maqlu I 37, for example, er$etu is repeated three times in an invocation of the underworld. This invocation in no way proves the existence of three underworlds.

Both me.se ba.da.dal and be.daddag.ge an den.lfl den.ki dnerigal list a number of items after an and ki. The former lists winds (IM), great winds (IM.gal), and fires (izi), followed by igi, bar, bar.ta, and bar.ta.igi. The surviving examples of the latter incantation list six items in addition to en and su, which appear in TIM 9 63. These are dU6 (hills), za (sides), gaba (chests), bara (daises), haI (crotches), and bar (backs). It is likely, however, that the priests \ who recited the incantations did not fully understand the meaning of the lists beginning with an and ki. In the Akkadian Utukku-Lemnutu incantation CT 51 142, the extract from me.se ba.da.dal beginning an. 7 ki. 7 is not translated from Sumerian into Akkadian. This suggests that the list here was recited as a
magical "hocus-pocus" formula. 14
Non-Cosmographic Items in the Lists
Many of the items listed after an and ki are not cosmographic features, For instance, the last four items listed in me.se ba.da.dal (igi, bar, bar.ta, \ bar. ta.igi) may refer to demons surrounding the supplicant. In Sumerian literary texts, igi and bar occur together in contexts where they refer to the front and back of human beings and gods. For example, in Inanna's Descent, demons guard Inanna at the front, back, and sides of the goddess when she is allowed to leave the underworld in search of a substitute: 15
13 The sign in BIN 2 16:6 also occurs in W. G. Lambert, Iraq 3862:3 and PBS 1333

The "boxes" of the nin and ezen signs in line 8 are uninscribed in the copy. The ezen sign might therefore be read bad or represent any of the EZENxX group of signs. 14 For the possibility of Elamite personal names recited as "magical mumbo

The one at her front was not a vizier, he held a scepter. The one at her back was not a courier, he carried a mace at his thigh. The small demons like a reed hut, the large demons like reed fencing clung to her side.
This suggests that igi.7 and bar.7 in me.56 ba.da.da1 may refer to demons that go in front of and behind the supplicant. Similarly, bar.ta.7 can refer to the demons at the sides of the supplicant, since bar.ta, like zB, is equated with ahu ('arm, side') in bilingual texts such as SBH no. 67:l6
.krirn.d&.kmbar.ta ba.da.gub.be.[en]

SBH p. 119 no. 67 rev. 7-8
Like an enemy you stand at the side.
Thus the chain igi.7 bar.7 b ar.ta.7 may be translated 'they are seven (demons) at the front, they are seven (demons) at the back, they are seven (demons) at the side'. The final phrase bar.ta.igi.7 is not attested elsewhere, but may be a compound of bar.t a and igi meaning 'front-side'. Most of the items listed in h6.daddag.ge a n den.lil den.ki dnerigal seem to refer to parts of the body afflicted by the lamas'tu-demons. For instance, TIM 9 63 itself preserves the phrase su.7.bi (seven bodies), and other versions of the incantation list z B ('sides'), g a ba ('chests'),ha1 ('crotches'),and b a r ('backs'). Thus both a n .7 ki.7 and a n .7.bi k i . 7.bi may refer to demons that originated in heaven and earth, but later came to surround the supplicant, or invade his body.
Interpretations of a n . 7 ki.7, an.7.bi ki.7.bi, an.7.bi ki.7.bi.da
There are at least three possible interpretations of a n .7 ki.7, a n .7.b i ki.7.bi, and a n .7.bi ki.7.bi.da.First, the phrases could be understood literally as referring to 14 separate cosmic regions. Second, they may be taken figuratively to mean 'all of heaven and all of earth' or 'all heavens and earths', because the numeral seven is sometimes translated from Sumerian into Akkadian as ki3s'atu 'all, entirety' (see CAD K 457). Third, the phrases can be understood to refer to demons in heaven and earth.
1. Seven Superimposed Heavens and Earths. It is conceivable that the incantations preserve a Sumerian tradition of seven superimposed levels of

heaven and earth that can be compared to the three superimposed heavens and earths of KAR 307 30-38. A tradition of seven heavens and seven earths was popular in the Near East during the later part of the first millennium B.C.E. and the first millennium C.E. Surviving Hebrew and Arabic texts from this time present cosmographies in which seven heavens and earths are explained in detail. For example, the Hebrew Book of Enoch speaks of seven superimposed heavens belonging to the seven archangels. In Enoch, these heavens rise above the spheres of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.17The Koran similarly speaks of seven heavens in Sura 65 verse 12 and Sura 78 verse 12.The earlier verse also alludes to the existence of seven analogous earths:l8
It is Allah who created the seven heavens: and concerning the earth, (it is) similar to them.
There is, however, no evidence to prove a direct connection between these later Hebrew and Arabic cosmographies and a possible Sumerian tradition of seven heavens and earths. Despite the absence of direct evidence for seven superimposed heavens and earths in Sumerian and Akkadian texts, indirect evidence for understanding a n . 7 ki.7, an.7.bi ki.7.bi, and an.ki.7.bi.daas allusions to 14 cosmic regions is available. If the phrases in the incantations allude to multiple heavens and earths, then these incantations invoke the heavens and earths to cure a supplicant. Such invocations of cosmic regions do occur in a number of other incantations. For example, Maqlu I 37 invokes ersetu 'earth' by repeating the cosmic place-name three times at the start of an incantation, and the medical incantation AMT 3211 rev. 1-3 begins by invoking KUR u KUR.NU.GI,.A 'earth and underworld' (see p. 278).

The one at her front was not a vizier, he held a scepter. The one at her back was not a courier, he carried a mace at his thigh. The small demons like a reed hut, the large demons like reed fencing dung to her side.
This suggests that igi.7 and bar.7 in me.se ba.da.dal may refer to demons that go in front of and behind the supplicant. Similarly, bar.ta. 7 can refer to the demons at the sides of the supplicant, since bar.ta, like za, is equated with abu ('arm, side') in bilingual texts such as SBH no. 67: 16
... erim.de.em bar.ta ba.da.gub.be.[en] . . . ki-ma a-a-bi a-bi-i ta-az-zi-[iz]
SBH p. 119 no. 67 rev. 7-8
Like an enemy you stand at the side.
Thus the chain igi. 7 bar. 7 bar.ta.7 may be translated 'they are seven (demons) at the front, they are seven (demons) at the back, they are seven (demons) at the side'. The final phrase bar. ta.igi. 7 is not attested elsewhere, but may be a compound of bar. ta and igi meaning 'front-side'. Most of the items listed in be.daddag.ge an den.lil den.ki dnerigal seem to refer to parts of the body afflicted by the lamastu-demons. For instance, TIM 9 63 itself preserves the phrase su. 7. bi (seven bodies), and other versions of the incantation list za ('sides'), gaba ('chests'), baI ('crotches'), and bar ('backs'). Thus both an. 7 ki. 7 and an. 7. bi ki. 7. bi may refer to demons that originated in heaven and earth, but later came to surround the supplicant, or invade his body.
Interpretationsofan.7 ki.7, an.7.bi ki.7.bi, an.7.bi ki.7.bLda
There are at least three possible interpretations of an.7 ki.7, an.7.bi ki.7.bi, and an.7.bi ki.7.bi.da. First, the phrases could be understood literally as referring to 14 separate cosmic regions. Second, they may be taken figuratively to mean 'all of heaven and all of earth' or 'all heavens and earths', because the numeral seven is sometimes translated from Sumerian into Akkadian as kissatu 'all, entirety' (see CAD K 457). Third, the phrases can be understood to refer to demons in heaven and earth.

heaven and earth that can be compared to the three superimposed heavens and earths 01' KAR 307 30-38. A tradition of seven heavens and seven earths was popular in the Near East during the later part of the first millennium B.C.E. and the first millennium C.E. Surviving Hebrew and Arabic texts from this time present cosmographies in which seven heavens and earths are explained in detaiL For example, the Hebrew Book of Enoch speaks of seven superimposed heavens beionging to the seven archangels. In Enoch, these heavens rise above the spheres of the sun, moon, stars, and planetsP The Koran similarly speaks of seven heavens in Sura 65 verse 12 and Sura 78 verse 12. The earlier verse also alludes to the existence of seven analogous earths: 18
It is Allah who created the seven heavens: and concerning the earth, (it is) similar to them.
There is, however, no evidence to prove a direct connection between these later Hebrew and Arabic cosmographies and a possible Sumerian tradition of seven heavens and earths. Despite the absence of direct evidence for seven superimposed heavens and earths in Sumerian and Akkadian texts, indirect evidence for understanding an.7 ki.7, an.7.bi ki.7.bi, and an.ki.7.bi.da as allusions to 14 cosmic regions
is available. If the phrases in the incantations allude to multiple heavens and earths, then these incantations invoke the heavens and earths to cure a supplicant. Such invocations of cosmic regions do occur in a number of other incantations. For example, Maqlu I 37 invokes en;etu 'earth' by repeating the cosmic place-name three times at the start of an incantation, and the medical incantation AMT 32/1 rev. 1-3 begins by invoking KUR u KURND.CI4.A 'earth and
underworld' (see p. 278). Similarly, zi-formulas invoking IM.7.bi 'the seven winds' and an.ki.ub.da.lfmmu 'the four quarters of heaven and earth' (E. Ebebng, ArOr 21 397:77-78) can be compared with the formula zi.an.na be.pa zi.ki.a be.pa in the incantations me.se ba.da.dal and be.daddag.ge an den.lil den.ki dner igal,l9

Chapter 10
Names for Heaven
an = samu, sama"u, samamu
The most common names for 'heaven' in Sumerian and Akkadian texts are Sumerian an and Akkadian samu. 1 Both names are used in all periods and genres, and both appear as names for heaven as a whole, or for individual levels of heaven as in KAR 307 and AO 8196, where the three heavens are the samu elutu, samu qablUtu, and samu saplutu (upper, middle, and lower heavens). Sumerian an is a singular noun. This name for heaven is also the Sumerian name for the king of the heavens, the god An. It occurs numerous times as a name for all of heaven in the cosmic pair an.ki ('heaven and earth'). Likewise, an is separated from ki in Sumerian accounts of the separation of heaven and earth (see pp. 135-42). There are also almost countless examples of an as a name for the sky where stars shine and birds fly, such as passages where stars are called mul.an.na ('star of heaven') and birds are called musen.an.na ('bird of heaven').2 Akkadian samu, unlike Sumerian an, is a plural noun. The name is a cognate of the most common names for heaven in other Semitic languages,
including Arabic W (sama"u) , Aramaic il"~iZi (semaya) , and Hebrew tl'~iV (samayim). In Akkadian, the name for heaven occurs both in the contracted form samu, as well as the uncontracted forms sama"u and samamu. The contracted form samu, originally *samawu, is by far the most common and is used
1 For lexical ex~mples of an = samu, see CAD Sfl 339-40; AHw 1160. For the
name written ag, see Sulgi B 198 'Q' mul.ag.ga (G. Castellino, Two Shulgi Hymns 5051). For a writing sa-mu-ma at Ugarit, see Ugaritica V 246:33", 247:13; and cf. sa-mu-maf sa-me-ma at El-Amarna (EA 211:17; 264:16).

224 Names for Heaven
in all genres in all periods. Although the origins of samu are unknown, a learned etymology is offered in the series Inamgisl;uranki:
1
v ~ ( )e v ~( )mes
. .. same an sa me a ... CT 25 50:17 (Livingstone 32:6)
... ] heaven: (composed) of water, ...
This explanation reflects a tradition that the heavens were fashioned from water. In Ee IV 137-46, for example, Marduk fashions the heavens from the watery corpse of Tiamat. Another connection between the name of heaven and water is that a singular homonym samu (samum with mimation) means 'rain'. The uncontracted forms most often occur in literary texts, because samu cannot end a line of poetry. The two forms are popular in different periods. The form samii'Jil is popular in second-millennium literary works such as Old Babylonian Etana (Kinnier-Wilson Etana 30:13, 36:35), Old Babylonian Atra-l;asis (Lambert-Millard Atra-hasls 94:48), and a passage in an Old Assyrian Lamastu incantation: 3
a-nu-um a-bu-sa is-tu sa-ma-e i-pu-~a-Si qa-qa-ar-su-um
BIN 4 126:10-13
Anu, her father, cast her (lamastu) down from heaven earthward.
The second form, samamil, is popular in the first millennium and is treated as a separate name for heaven in Malku, where samamil is listed as a synonym for samu (CT 18 10 iii 22). This form apparently retains the final consonant w, with w changing to m. An identical phenomena is found in the synonyms mu and mamil 'water' (see A. Rainey, Tel Aviv 3 131:1; W. G. Lambert, Fest. Reiner 192:63.4 Almost all examples of samamil occur in literary works, incantations, or stock phrases such as such as 'star of heaven' (kakkab samelsamami), 'bird of heaven' (i~~ilr samelsamami), 'writing of heaven' (sitir samelsamami) and samamil u qaqqaru 'heaven and earth'.5 Early examples of samamil occur in an Old Babylonian hymn to IStar (VAS 10213:6',8', 10'). In addition to the numerous examples of the equation an = samu in bilingual texts and lexical lists, an is equated with asru in Commentary B to Enuma
Elish (see J Bottero, Fest. Finklestein 13:135), and samu is equated with a number of rare Sumerian names for heaven in lexical lists (these names are examined below, pp. 228-33). Three more Akkadian synonyms of samu (burilmil, asru, and ermi danim) are listed in Malku II (See CAD SI1 340).

mamil in Ee IV 137-46.
andurunna 'Where Anu Dwells' 225
andurunna 'Where Anu Dwells'
The term andurunna, literally 'Where Anu Dwells', occurs as a cosmic place-name in Enuma Elish, "An Address of Marduk to the Demons;' and an incantation to Enmesarra. The meaning of the term is explained in a Balaghymn where andurunna occurs in a non-cosmic context:
ki an.dur.ru.na.[se] u.mi.a mar.ma.an.ze.en a-sar da-nu-um [us-sa-b]u ni-si l;i-sa-nu ki an.dur.ru.na.se da.nun.na ki an.dur.ru.na.se u.mi.a mar.ma.an.ze.en SBH p. 44 rev. 33-36 (Cohen Balag 227-28)
o people, hurry to where Anu dwells. Anunna, (hurry) to where Anu dwells.
o people, hurry to where Anu dwells.
Only in the incantation to Enmesarra is it certain that andurunna is a name for heaven. Here, andurunna is paired with the name for earth er~etum, just as another name for heaven, asru is paired with the underworld name kurnugu:
bel as-ri u kur-nu-gi4 sa-du-u sa da-nun-na-ki
pa-ri-is purusse(eS.bar) er~etimtim mar-kas rabuu sa an-durun-na R. Borger, ZA 61 77:43-44
(Enmesarra) Lord of Heaven and Underworld, Mountain of the Anunnaki, Determiner of the Destinies of Earth, Great Bond of andurunna.
In Ee I 23-24, the place-name occurs long before the heavens are built. In An Address of Marduk to the Demons B:5 (w. G. Lambert, AfO 17 313), the name occurs in the epithet of Marduk-Asalluhi, mumaJir andurunna 'Commander of andurunna'.
The name andurunna also occurs in the series An = Anum as the name of an official of Anu (CT 24 2:11; see p. 109). Here the divine name may have been intended to be read ddurun.na.
asru 'Place'
Akkadian asru is a poetic name for heaven. Th~ name occurs only in lexical lists and literary texts. In Malku II 100 (see CAD SI1 340) and Commentary B to Ee VII 135 (Fest. Finklestein 13:135), asru is explained as a synonym of samu. In Ee VII 135 itself, asru is paired with the poetic name for earth danninu, and this same pair probably also occurred in a now-broken line of The Marduk Theology: asra ibnu iptiq[u dannina] (CT 25 47 K 8222 ii 12'). In two Nabu hymns (w. G. Lambert, JAOS 88130 rev. 6; Khorsabad II 130:13), asru is paired with the poetic name for the underworld, kigallu. In the incantation to Enmesarra (ZA 61 77:43-44), asru is paired with the underworld name, kurnugu.



226 Names for Heaven
asrata
The cosmic place-name asrata occurs in Ee IV 141-42 and Ee V 121-22, but it is not certain from these contexts that asrata is an alternate name for the heavens (samu) that belong to Anu or a feature of these heavens (see p. 114). There are at least three possible explanations of the name. First, the name may be a feminine form of asru. Second, asrata may be related to the Babylonian plural form asrtltu from the noun asirtu 'shrine'. This form occurs in The Agum-Kakrime Inscription (5R 33 ii 43, iv 5) and a Nabopolassar inscription (VAB 4 86 i 4//JCS 26 67 no. 86:5). If so, asrata may refer in some way to shrines of the gods in heaven. Third, asrata may be related to the word asartu 'hard ground', which occurs with a construct form asrat (see CAD A/2 420). KAR 307 and AO 8196 preserve traditions that the floors of the heavens are made of hard stone.
burumu, burummu
The term burumu is a common name for the level of the stars or the night sky in first-millennium texts. The name derives from the root bartlmu B 'to be speckled' (CAD B 103) and refers to the appearance of the night sky, where stars are seen as specks on a dark background. Like samu, burumu is a plural noun, as is demonstrated by the plural adjective in the term burumu ellutu 'clear night skies' (R. C. Thompson AAA 20 80:4; OIP 2 149 V 5). Passages identifying burumu as the night sky include an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II, where a beautiful boat is said to sparkle like a kakkab burumu 'star of the night sky' (PBS 1579 ii 25), and a passage in a Neo-Assyrian inscription where the Moon-god illuminates the burumu:
[d]sin na-[an-na-ar samee u er$etiti] bel age (en.aga) mu-nam-mir bu-ru-me
F. Thureau-Dangin, RA 2714:6-7
Sin, Mo[on-god of heaven and earth], Lord of the Lunar-disk, who illuminates the night-skies.
Additional evidence identifying burumu as the region where the stars shine is found in the term sitir burume 'writing of the night sky', which refers to the fixed arrangement of stars in the sky. This sense of sitir burume is revealed in a hymn to Assur:
[ x x k]i-ma si-tir bu-ru-um-me ul i-mes-sa a-dan-na
SM 3 p. 4 no. 1:21 (BA 565321, cf. SM 3 p. 5 no. 1:24)
[who .. li]ke the "writing of the night sky" does not disregard a fixedtime.
In astronomical contexts, the adannu of stars are the fixed times of their risings and settings over the course of the year. Thus, the adannu of sitir burume must refer to the regular pattern of stellar movement during the course of a year. Similarly, the term kippat burume u mtl[ttlti] 'circle of the night sky and the
elatu 227
lands', which occurs in a hymn to Marduk (SM 37:8), and kippat burume, in a hymn to Nabu (S. A. Strong, PSBA 20 156:16), refer to the circular shape of the sky on clear nights.
elatu
The term elatu 'higher regions' is used both on its own and paired with sapltltu 'lower regions'. On many occasions, sapltltu is a name for the underworld (see pp. 292-91), so elatu can often be a name for any higher region, including both the heavens and earth's surface. For instance, in Underworld Vision 68-69 (SM 376 rev. 28-29), the prince is ordered back to the elatu during a dream and wakes up on the earth's surface. On a few occasions, however, elatu is clearly a name for the heavens or part of the sky. For instance, in MiddleAssyrian Etana, elatu occurs twice in broken contexts during Etana and the eagle's flight to heaven (Kinnier Wilson Etana 64 I1G 2', 66:10). Elsewhere, the Moon-god, Sun-god and !Star (Venus) shine in elatu. In Ee V 11-12, Marduk commands Nannar to appear in elatu (see p. 116); the Sun-god shines in the elatu in a bilingual incantation (A. Falkenstein, UVB 1536:5); and IStar (Venus) is said to sit on the dais of Anu in elatu in the Akkadian portion of The Exaltation of IStar (B. Hruska, ArOr 37 484:37-38, see p. 250).
ermi danim 'Anu's Cover'
In Malku II 101 (see CAD S/1 340), ermi danim 'Anu's Cover' is listed as a synonym of samu. Apart from Malku, the term occurs three additional times in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions as a name for heaven paralleling the underworld name kigallu (OIP 2149 V 4; Ebeling Parfumrez. pI. 27:10; Borger Esarh. 75:3), and once in an epithet of the tuppi simtlti 'Tablet of Destinies':
[p]i-ris-ti sa-ma-mu it, es-m[ab-bi] [m]ar-kas er-mi a-nu u ga-an-$ir $er-ret t[e-ne-se-ti?]
A. George, Iraq 48 135 B 4-5
(Tablet of Destinies) [S]ecret of Heaven and Great Shrine, Bond of "Anu's Cover" and Underworld, Lead-Rope of M[ankind?]
Two passages in the inscriptions of Assurbanipal (Streck Ash. 148:26; Thompson Esarh. pl. 14 i 31) refer to ermi danim made of musukkannu-wood that are decorated to resemble the sky (samtlmeS). These wooden ermi danim are wooden ceilings or canopies of some sort. A comparable musukkannu-wood samu is built by Nebuchadnezzar II in VAB 4 164:12.6
esarra
Akkadian esarra, like asrata, only occurs as a name for part of heaven in Enuma Elish. In Ee IV 145-46 and Ee V 119-20, the region of heaven named
6 For samu-canopies, including the golden samu of Esagil, see CAD SI1 348 2.
Note also the canopy of Enki's boat an.ma.dill (see J. Klein, Fest. Artzi 93:19 n. 151).



228 Names for Heaven
eSarra belongs to Enlil and is located above the Apsu and earth's surface but below the heavens proper (samu/samame) that belong to Anu. The name esarra also occurs as a name for temples of various deities in various cities, including the temple of Assur in Assur and the temple of Enlil in Nippur (see George Temples 144-45).
subat danim, subat same 'The Abode of Anu, Heaven'
The expression subat danim stands in apposition to the term samu rapsatu 'broad heavens' in the Akkadian portion of a passage from The Moon God and the Demons:
an.dagal.la ki.tus an lugal.la.ke4 bul.dib.be sU8.ga gaba.ri nu.tuku.a.mes
ina samee rap-su-ti su-bat da-nim sar-ri lem-nis iz-za-zu-ma ma-ai-ra ul i-su-u
CT 16 19:48-51
In the broad heavens, the Abode of Anu the king, they stand angrily. They have no rival.
A parallel term, subat same/SamaJi occurs in the prologue to the law-code of ljammurabi (CH ii 30-31) and the inscriptions of Tukulti-Ninurta I (Weidner TN 16:50-52). In the later text, the Assyrian king decorates a room, making it as beautiful as subat same. In a parallel from the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser I (AKA 98:98-101), a room is decorated with stars to make it shine like the libbi same 'middle of heaven'. In this context, subat same is the sky where stars are seen at night.
Equivalences of samu
A number of equivalences of samu7 are known from lexical lists and commentaries. In lexical lists, these terms appear in the left "Sumerian" column, indicating that they are non-Akkadian words. Because most of the equivalences only occur in lexical lists, it is not always possible to determine if they are names for heaven or equivalences of the homonym samu meaning 'rain'.
The List K. 2035+ ii 17-33
K. 2035+ (2R 50+) contains a list of equivalences of samu. At present, 17

In the commentary, the syllable me of the word melammu is understood as a name for heaven while lam is equated with erl?etu 'earth'. Additional examples occur in Kassite-period cylinder seals, where me me is used as a writing for same u erl?etim in epithets (see W G. Lambert, BiOr 32 222 4.l6).

MSL 410:116
Sumerian gis is also equated with samu in Idu II 176 (CAD SI1 339), and in Syllabaire Sa from Emar (Emar 537:208) where gis occurs with a gloss ni-es (for gis). Another example of giS = samu is found in a commentary explaining the name of one of two horses of the flood: gis.lam.sar.sar = mustilbil same u ersetim 'The One who understands Heaven and Earth' (E. Weidner, AfO 19 11'0:40).10 Both m u and giS also occur in the name for the sky or parts of the sky mu.be and gis.be (see pp. 239-38).
im (K 2035+ ii 23). Sumerian im is also attested as an equivalent of samu in Idu II 340: i.mi = 1M = sa-mu-u (see CAD SI1 340).
si (K 2035+ ii 25). The equation si = samu may be based on the equation si.un.na = elM same, which is attested in a bilingual hymn from Druki
dutu.gim dungu.na na.an.ku4.k [u4.dam]
ki-ma dsamas ana u-pe-e la ter-ru-u[b]
dnanna!.gim si.un.na mus nam!.ba. [an.tum.ma]ll ki-ma dsin ina e-lat same e la ta-pa-ra-[ak-ka]
SBH p. 128 rev. 36-39
Like the Sun-god, you do not enter a cloud. Like the Moon-god, you do not stop in the "Heights of Heaven."
In this passage si must be the equivalent of samu because un is an equivalent of eLU ('high'; see CAD E 110), although un itself may be equated with samu in Aa VIII/2 46 (MSL 14498). Another example of si = samu is found in Aa IIII4 171:
si = nu-u-rum 'light' si = na-ma-rum 'to shine' si = na-pa-bu 'to kindle' si = sa-mu-u 'heaven' (MSL 14341:168-71)
Here si may be a name for heaven because si has a general meaning 'light'. According to NBC 11108 (see p. 139), the heavens glow with their own light independent of the luminaries in the sky. A related equation si.an.ta = eliitu occurs in a late bilingual incantation to Dtu (A. Falkenstein DVB 1536:5).
10 Compare also the name of Nippur dir.giS.lam 'Bond of Heaven and Earth', which is equivalent to the more common dur.an.ki (see A. George, RA 85 160), and 0. Neugebauer and A. Sachs, JCS 21 213: gis.nim giS.su = 'east, west'. See also p. 257 for Craig ABRT I 32 rev. 9.

zikum (K 2035+ ii 27). The equivalence zikum = samu is also documented in Aa I12 236 (MSL 14 215), while zikum itself occurs in the Dr III personal name ur.zikum.ma (Kang SACT I 119:2). This same sign with the reading engur is a common Sumerian name for the Apsu.
zikara (K 2035+ ii 28). Two entries in Antagal preserve equivalences for samu that may be compared with zikara (IMxIM) = samu.

Antagal III 177 (MSL 17 156)
Antagal G 281 (MSL 17228)
Here, zigar (IMxIM) is the same name as zikara. The entry in Antagal G may also represent this name, although a different Sumerian writing is used. The name(s) of heaven zikara, zigar, zigarum presumably represent a foreign word (s).
idim (K 2035+ ii 30). The equation idim (BAD) = samu occurs in K. 2035+, Nabnitu IV (see p. 229), Aa VIIII2 (MSL 14499:59), and Emar 537:693', 568:51'.12
uras. Sumerian uras occurs as a synonym for samu in K. 2035a+, Nab
nitu IV (see p. 229), and Izi H 232 (MSL 13 208), as well as Ea I 338b and Aa II 8:35 (MSL 14 194,240). A Sumerian literary example of uras as a name for the sky occurs in a hymn of praise to the barge of Enlil in Shulgi R:
ma.sag.zu.u dnanna ur5.ra.as sal[ga? (x x x )].fme1.e[n]
ma.egir.zu.u dutu an.ur.r[a (x x x x) e.a.me.en] J. Klein, Fest. Artzi 104:37-38
As for your prow, you are (like) Nanna graci[ng ( ... ) the sky. As for your stern, [you are (like)] Dtu [rising o]n the horizon.
Elsewhere, however, uras is usually a name for earth rather than heaven. For instance, the Sumerian pair an.uras occurs in numerous contexts meaning 'heaven and earth'.13 The process by which uras developed a second meaning 'heaven' is not clear but may parallel the evolution of the divine name duras from a name for Anu's spouse, Antum, to a name for Anu himself.l4
12 For this name at Ugarit, see J. Huehnergard, NABU 1991 p. 39 no. 58. 13 For the cosmic pair an.uras, see Sjoberg Moongod 67 n. 4, 75 n. 5, and 79 nn. 14-15. Note also ZA 52 59:27; OrSuec 19-20 147 no. 3 rev. 6.

232 Names for Heaven
bur, bur, buru, buru. Sumerian buru 'pit, hole, well' occurs as an
equivalent of samu in the catchline of the god-list K. 2100 (CT 25 18 rev. ii 20). The same name, or a homonym, is also attested at Emar: bur = ljAL = samu (Emar 537:291). Akkadian buru occurs three times as a name for heaven: twice in a late copy of a hymn to Aya (SpTU III 75:12, 19) and once as a variant of
burumu in a su,ila to Nabu (see w. Mayer, Or 59 461:9; see n. 9 [4]). The Akkadian name may be a loanword from Sumerian bur/buru or be derived from
burumu, as suggested by W. Mayer, in Or 59 465.15
U+GA (utal;,t, utu). The sign U+GA occurs in Sb and a precursor to Ea with readings utah and utu as equivalents of samu and supuk same: 16
u.ta.ah U+GA sa-mu-u 1 su-puk sa-mu-u u.tu U+GA di-ik-tum
u.tu
Sb87-88 (MSL 3 104; 4 206)

Textual examples of utah demonstrate that the term is a name for the sky. In a hymn to Nannar, the Moon-god shines in utah:
a.a dnanna utahbe.bad.ta gi6 dUlO.dulO gal.zu A. Sjoberg, OrSuec 19/20 146:7
Father Nanna, who knows how to make the night sweet throughout the distant heavens.
Parallels are found in a Rim-Sin Hymn (UET 6 101:19) and two Rim-Sin inscriptions (RIM 4 272:6, 300:5).
un/ug. Sumerian un/ug (high) is equated with samu in Aa VIII/2 46, 51 (MSL 14 498-99). A related name is listed later in this same tablet: [Xl = EZENx KASKAL = sa-qu-u, sa-mu-u (MSL 14499:80-81). The name may also oc
cur in a hymn to Nanna: 17
un.na e me.an.na su.duT7CL 16 pI. 152:2 (Sjoberg Mondgott 65:2)
(Nanna) who comes out in "The Above" perfects the me of heaven.
15 W. Mayer in Or 59 465 n. 9 derives the name burumue > burumlwe > buruw. For
Aa II14 129 (MSL 14 283), see W. G. Lambert, JNES 33 302 n. 6. For the god-list K. 2100,
see A. Kilmer, JAOS 83 423. See also Ea II:216 (MSL 14256).
16 In Or 52 237-40, M. Civil argues that U+GA was originally used to designate a
cereal dish that came to be known as sipku in Akkadian. Sumerian U +GA, then, came to
be a name for heaven through the homonym sipkulsupku in sipiklsupuk same in the
Old Babylonian period. See also CAD D 138-39 diktu and Charpin Le Clerge 199. A
word utah meaning 'light rain' also occurs in astronomical diaries (see Sachs-Hunger
Diaries I 33).

gina. The name girra for heaven is known from parallel entries in Aa II/4 (MSL 14284:141) and Antagal D 121 (MSL 17205). In both lists, girra is written U.MAS.KAB. In Antagal D, the name occurs before three names for earth (see p. 271). Exactly how girra can to be a name for heaven is unclear.18
Kassite Names for Heaven
Kassite names for heaven may be listed in a Kassite-Akkadian list, where dagilgi and ilulu are equated with samU.
da-gil-gi samuu i-Iu-Iu samuu zi-in-bi-na zi-na mi -ri -i a -as er-Ije-tum tu-ru-uh-na sa-a-ru T. Pinches, JRAS 1917 103:19-23 (Balkan Kassit. Stud. 4)
At least one of the two Kassite equivalences of samu could mean 'rain' instead of 'heaven'. The third term is translated zi-na, which may be a writing for Akka
dian zinnu 'rain'.
Names of Parts of the Sky
A number of Sumerian terms and Akkadian equivalents serve as names for parts of the sky. These include: _
'Horizon':
'Zenith':
'Middle of the Sky':
an.ur = isid same 'Heaven's Base, The Base of Heaven', an.za 'Heaven's Edge', nablptu
an.pa = ehit same 'Heaven's Top, The Heights of Heaven' .
an.sa = qereb same, libbi same
Akkadian supuk same and its Sumerian equivalents including giS.he, mu.he, ul.he.
These t~rms are not used in a consistent manner. They often seem to be synonymous WIth one another or to refer to overlapping areas. For example, different versions of a bilingual lamentation translate mu.he as supuk same (Cohen Canonical Lamentations p. 154:18) and elfit same (KAR 375 ii 42-43; see Cohen Canonical Lamentations p. 173).
18 Note in this context a broken passage in Inamgishuranki that may relate the
heav~n~ to the fire-god Girra: ... J an dgi-ri '... J (of?) AnlHeaven is Girra?' (CT 25 50:
~8, Llvmgstone 32:7; and van Soldt Solar Omens 45:17': gi-ra-aU.MAS.KAB: sa-mu-u). Girra
IS both a son of Anu and constellation in Girra and Elamatum (c. Walker, AnSt 33145
53, esp. 150 n. 48) and a constellation in Prayers to the Gods of the Night (RA 32 180:15,
181:16).



234 Names for Heaven
Each of the terms consists of a name of heaven, with a second noun referring to a portion of the sky. In the Akkadian terms, the part of the sky comes first, followed by samu or burilmil in the genitive case. In the Sumerian terms, the opposite occurs, with the name of heaven placed first. For instance, an.ur and an.pa consist of an (heaven) followed by ur and pa. Likewise, mu.he and gis.he consist of the Sumerian names mu and gis (which are equated with one another and samu in the Emesal vocabulary (MSL 410:116), plus he. The order of nouns in these Sumerian terms is the reverse of the standard genitive construction, where the part precedes the whole. This reversal of order cannot be explained, but parallel constructions occur with a few other nouns, including giS 'tree', kur 'mountain', ab 'sea', uru 'city', and gi 'reed';19 Ancient scholars conceived of these names as a group of related terms. Entries an.ur = isid same and an.pa = eLM same often occur consecutively in lexical lists, Antagal G lists four sets of terms as a group, and Emar 567:2-4 pre
serves three paired terms: 20

an.ur = isid same, an.za = pat same, saplan same. 21 Terms for 'horizon' refer to the lower portion of the sky, including the actual horizon where heaven and earth meet and a band above the horizon. This portion of the sky is usually identified as an.za 'Heaven's Edge' or an.ur 'Heaven's Base' in Sumerian texts and isid same 'the Base of Heaven' in Akkadian texts. In addition to the visible horizon in the sky, an.ur, an.za, isid same, and piit same also refer to the edge of the earth's surface. The border between 'Horizon' and 'Zenith' is never defined in any Sumerian or Akkadian text. 22

Names of Parts of the Sky 235
an.ur isid same 'Heaven's Base', 'The Base of Heaven'. Sumerian an.ur and Akkadian isid same are equated with each other in numerous lexical lists and bilingual works (see CAD I 235-36). In Bit Rimki, an.ur = isid same is the place where heaven and earth meet and the Sun passes from heaven to earth at sunrise:
ki.se an.ki tes.bi la.a.ta an.ur.ta um.ta.e.na.z[u.s]e
ana e-ma sa-mu-u u en;etumtum istenisniS na-an-du-ru is-tu i-sid samee ina (a-$e-ka)
R. Borger, JCS 21 3:4
When you (Sun-god) rise at the place where heaven and earth embrace, from the horizon.
In Ee V 17-20, the Moon and Sun are said to see each other at isid same at the middle of the month, the time of the month when the Moon rises at the eastern horizon just as the Sun sets at the western horizon. The fact that an.ur and isid same include a band of heaven above the horizon is demonstrated by BBR 2 p. 102:101 and parallel passages, where isid same turns red at dawn before the
Sun rises. 23 At this time of day, the lower part of the eastern sky above the horizon is tinged red by the approaching Sun. A parallel with ur.an.na instead of an.ur is found in Lugale 181:
me.dam ur.an.na sig he.ma.da.gim sas.se urs he.en.na.nam.ma ma-ti-ma Hid samee ki-ma na-ba-si $a-rip si-i lu-u ki-a-am
Lugale 74:181 (Bilingual Version)
When the horizon is dyed red like red-wool, let this be so.
an.za = pat same 'Heaven's Edge', 'The Edge of Heaven', Sumerian an.za is a near synonym of an.ur = isid same. Although the normal meaning of za is piitu 'edge, border', za is also equated with isdu in Aa VIIII4 9 (MSL 14 509). Like an.ur, an.za comprises the actual horizon, plus a band above the horizon. In Gudea Cyl. A IX:18-19 (see p. 94), kur.kur 'the lands~ apparently extends to an.za, just as earth meets heaven at an.ur and isid same in Bit Rimki.24 In the hymn to Inanna an.ta.e.a.ra, an.za includes the part of heaven above the horizon where Venus shines:
nin an.usan an.za.se mah. [am] Reisman Two Hymns 153:85
The Lady of the Evening (Inanna) [is] magificent at the horizon.
23 For parallels, see chapter 1 n. 16 (p. 10). 24 Note also Westenholz OSP 1 no. 6:2 (= B. Alster, Kramer AV p. 14): kur.kur gurum.u den.lil an.za.se, and Fest. Sjoberg 305:59 an.ki.za. til.la.rbi l.se. See also W. Romer, Kraus AV 305.



236 Names for Heaven
The planet Venus alternately shines in the lower western sky at dusk, and the lower eastern sky at dawn. A bilingual example of an.za as a cosmic place name occurs in UtukkuLemnutu VI, where an.za is equated with pat same.
mu nu.tuku mU.ne an.za.se
su-ma ul i-su-u sum-su-nu ana pat samee
CT 16 33:189
o (demon) who has no name, their name (goes) to the horizon.
In this context, an.za and pat same refer to the ends of the earth's surface where demons could presumably cross into the underworld, just as the Sun rises and sets from the underworld. A parallel with names for both heaven and earth occurs in Samsuiluna E:25
ni.me.lam nam.lugal.la.mu za.an.rkil.ke4 he.'en.dul'
pu-lul:y-ti me-lam sar-ru-ti-ia pa-at sa-me-e it er-I?e-tum lu ik-tum
RIM 4 382, Sumerian version 68-70 Akkadian version 64-66
My terrifying royal splendor covered the borders (i.e. all) of heaven and earth.
saplan same 'The Lower Parts of Heaven'
The term saplan same occurs in an incantation to Shamash, replacing isid same alongside an unusual writing of eMt same:
(istu> AN.PA samee ana sap-La-an samee us-su-ru sa-ru-ru-ka
KAR 32:26
Your shine runs free (from> the "zenith of heaven" to the horizon.
Zenith (an.pa, eMt same, appi same) 'Heaven's Tip', 'The Heights of Heaven', 'The Tip of Heaven'
The portion of the sky an. p a = elat same is the part of the sky above an. lir = elM same. The meaning of elatu 'upper parts' in elM same is obvious, because elM same is the top part of the sky, but the etymology of an.pa requires explanation. Two ancient explanations of an.pa are available. First, pa is understood as appu 'tip' in Proto-Izi: [a] n.pa = a-pi sa~me (MSL 1336 B 5). Second, pa is itself explained as elMu in Aa and Antagal:
V A 25 Not~ also M. Civil, NABU 1987 n. 49: za an.ki; F. Al-Rawi, Iraq 523:21: pat kissat

In many contexts, an.pa = elM same is paired with an.lir = isid same, indicating that these two parts of the sky together comprise the entire visible heavens. In The Exaltation of IStar, the Sun- and Moon-gods are assigned the task of keeping the stars on their courses from an.lir = isid same to an.pa = elat same (B. Hruska, ArOr 37 484:55-56; see pp. 144-45). In the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, Nebuchadnezzar II, and Neriglissar, the kings claim worldwide dominion from isid same to elM Same. 26 Here, these two parts of heaven apparently cover the entire earth's surface (see diagram, p. 261). In addition to the Sun, Moon, and stars, which perform duties in 'horizon' and 'zenith' in The Exaltation of IStar, other texts place meteorological phenomena, including clouds, a rainbow, and akukiltu 'haze', in elat same (see CAD E 79 2').
an.pa an.ka, AN.PA same. Two unusual writings of 'the zenith of heaven', an.pa an.ka and AN.PA same, apparently construe an.pa as equivalent to elatu instead of elat same. In the Kassite period Sumerian work The Duties and Powers of the Gods, the Akkadian-speaking author apparently translates elM same back into Sumerian as a genitive construction an. pa an.ka:
... x].da ku.ga.bi nu.mu.ni.in.te.es.am an.pa an.ka ba.ra.an.sum.mu.us dnanna gi6 zalag.ge.da u4.da ug.ga ku.ku.da [g] iskim gi6.a [zu.z] u.da ...

The Akkadian writing AN.PA same in KAR 32 26 (see p. 236) parallels Sumerian an.pa an.ka.
mll.be = elat same. As noted above (p. 233, KAR 375 ii 42'-43'), one exemplar of a bilingual lamentation preserves the equation m u.he = elat same.
26 See CAD E 79 2'; Tadmor Tigi. 158:4, 194:4. Compare The Gilgamesh Letter 1

238 Names for Heaven
sLun.na = eUtt same. The term si.un.na is translated as elat same in the late copy of a bilingual hymn (SBH 128 rev. 38-39; see p. 230) where the Moon-god is placed in the region. Here, si is probably the name of heaven si = samu, and un is probably to be interpreted as elatu. Three additional examples where the Moon shines in si.un.na also occur in Sumerian literature: Sjoberg Moongod 70:2; ELA 27l; Death of Ur-Nammu 13 (see JCS 21 113). The Sumerian term also occurs in a lists of cosmic terms in Proto-Izi and Nabnitu:
an ki gis·b e ul.be ub.sI kur.un.na si.un.na ub.da.4
an.si.u [n.na si.BAnb [a si.un. [n] a kur.BAnba kur.un.na

[sa-du-u e-lu-u]

Nabnitu XXV 145-49 (MSL 16 227)
In Nabnitu XXV 145 as restored, the term an.si.un.na is construed on the pattern of an.pa, an.ur, and an.za, with the name of heaven an followed by si.un.na (= elatu). In surviving examples of si.un.na, only the Moon is found in the region, although the Sun and meteorological phenomena, as well as the Moon, are found in an.pa = elat same.
'The Middle of Heaven' (an.sa, sa.an.na, gereb same, libbi same)
The use of terms for the 'middle of heaven'27 as a part of the sky are problematic. Sumerian an.sa occurs in a few passages as an unseen portion of heaven above the sky, where Anu lives (see pp. 247-49). Elsewhere, Sumerian sa with a following noun in the genitive case can be used as a preposition meaning 'in'. Similarly, the Akkadian prepositional phrases ina libbi and ina qereb often mean little more than ina ('in'). Thus an.sa, ina qereb same, and ina libbi same often occur with the meaning 'in heaven'. Nevertheless, there are examples where an.sa, qereb same, and libbi same do seem to be used as names for part of the sky. In Antagal G 223-26 and Emar 567:2-4 an.sa.gal an.a.sa.ga = qereb same occurs in lists with names for 'Horizon', 'Zenith', and
27 CAD Q 8 qablu A b offers no syllabic examples of qabal same as a name for the 'middle of the sky'. Thus, examples of MURUB4 same under qablu could be rendered
qereb same.
Names of Parts of the Sky 239
supuk same!burume (see p. 234). Likewise, sa.an.na = qereb same occurs in a common blessing formula alongside names for heaven and earth:
an.gim be.en.ku.ga ki.gim be.en.sikil.la sa.an.gim be.en.daddag.ga
May he be pure like heaven. May he be clean like earth.
ki-ma samee li-liZ ki-maen;etimtim li-bi-ib ki-ma qe-reb same e lim-mir
Surpu 53:26-28
May he shine like the "middle of heaven."
The shine of an.sa and qereb same is the glow of the stars. This is demonstrated by an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I where a temple is described in terms of the stars and libbi same:
ki-ma llb-bi samee u-be-en-ni i-ga-ra-a-te-su ki-ma sa-ru-ur ~i-it kakkabanimes u-si-im u-sar-ril;
AKA 98:98-101
I decorated it like the heart of heaven. I made its walls shine with a brillance befitting the light of the stars.
Other visible astronomical and meteorological phenomena seen in an.sa include the Moon (Sjoberg Mondgott 44:9), the Sun (Gudea Cyl. B 1:7), Venus (Reisman Two-Hymns 153:82, 154:104, 155:120, 157:141), clouds (Sjoberg Mondgott 119:8); and rainbows (EWO 345).28 Although it may be assumed that the "Middle of Heaven" included the center of the sky around the apex of the celestial dome, it is not possible to determine how far the "Middle of Heaven" extended downward.

giS.be, mu.ge, ul/u14.be, u14, utab
The term supuk same and its equivalences occur in literary texts as the portion of the heavens where stars, the Sun, Moon, and Venus shine and winds blow. In The Moon God and the Demons (= Utukku Lemnutu 16), the Sun, Moon, and Venus are said to regulate ul.be = supuk same:
dnanna dutu dinanna.ke4 ul.be.a si.sa,e.de im.ma.ni.in.gar dsin(30) dsamas u dis-tar su-puk samee ana su-te-su-ri uk-tin-nu

240 Names for Heaven
In Antagal G 223-24 (see p. 234), u14 and uld}e.a are equated with supuk
same and supuk burumu. In variant exemplars of Sb, Sumerian utab is translated alternately as samu and supuk same (see MSL 3 104:87, MSL 4 206:87), while ul.be is translated as supuk same in the hymn to Inannallstar (Cohen Ersemma 132:24 = SBH 53 rev. 48-49), but as samu in the Exaltation of IStar (B. Hruska ArOr 37 484:29-30), and LKA 23 rev. 8'-9'. Thus, supuk same and its equivalences are in some sense equivalent to the entire sky. Although the above examples establish the sense of the terms, their origins and etymologies are uncertain. Therefore, it is useful to examine each more closely.
gis.be, mu.be, ul.be, uI4.be.29 The terms gis.be, mu.be, ul.be, and u14.be consist of a common element be with a preceeding noun. The element
be corresponds to supku in Akkadian supuk same, and while giS, mu, ul/u14 correspond to samu. Thus, the first elements should be names for heaven or related terms. Sumerian gis and m u are listed as equivalents of samu in the Emesal vocabulary (MSL 4 10:116) and K 2035+ ii 20', 22' (see p. 229). The word ul/u14 does not occur as an equivalent of samu but may be identified as ul =
kakkabu'star' (see CAD K 46). Nonetheless, the origins of the element be in the Sumerian terms and how be came to be equivalent to supuk same remains unclear, because no surviving evidence for be = supkulsipku exists other than the terms themselves. One possibility is that the meaning of be = supkulsipku reflects an early lexical tradition that did not survive to be included in Old Babylonian canonical lists suchs as Proto-Ea and Proto-Aa (see MSL 14 476, 489), although the meaning "giS.be, mu.be, ul.be = supuk same (and equivalents)" did survive. An Early Dynastic period example of u14.be referring to the
sky may occur in The Stele of the Vultures (see J. Cooper, RA 74 94).30
supuk samelsipik same, supuk burumu. Like their Sumerian equivalents, Akkadian supuk same, sipik same, and supuk burumu consist of a name for heaven and a second noun. All three terms are synonymous. Akkadian supku and sipku are equivalent nouns derived from the root sapaku 'to pour out, to heap up', and burumu and samu are synonyms. The terms can be compared with the parallel constructions sipik sadilsupuk sadi (see AHw 1245 sipku 4; 1280 supku 2), which refer to the foundations of mountains. As such,
29 The reading he for CAN is based on the variants gis.he/he (= supuk same) in TCS 3 36:324. Additional writings with he may be found in TCS 3 26 164 (ul.he.a/ utahUE.a) and MSL 11 61 v 156 (ul.liE). However, ul.liE here is followed by an.sar, kLSar 'all of heaven, all of earth' (MSL 11 61 v 157-58), so gis.liE, mU.liE, ul.liE might best be understood, at least in some cases, as gis/m u.sar ('all of heaven') and uLSar ('all
of the stars'). If liE is always to be read sar in these compounds, then a reading gan for . liE cannot be ruled out (i.e., gis.gan, mu.gan, ul.gan, perhaps again 'all of heaven, all
of the stars' on the basis of CAN = kullatu 'entirety'). The element he might also be the same as that in he.nun = nuasu 'abundance'. Cf. TCS 3 115 no. 324 for further examples and discussion and ibid. no. 164. 30 See also p. 140 for Sollberger Corpus Ukg. 15 iii 2: ul. [he].
Names of Parts of the Sky 241
the imagery suggested by supuk samelsipik same and supuk burumu may be that of the sky serving as the foundation for the unseen higher regions of heaven above, just as mountains rise above their foundations. 31
Other Examples of supuk same and Its Equivalences. Numerous other examples prove that supuk same and its equivalents are names for at least part of the sky. A passage in The Moon God and the Demons states that seven wicked storm demons whirled around the Moon in u14.be = supuk same (CT 16 20:70
74); hymns to Nannar place the Moon in gis.be (A. Sjoberg, OrSuec 19/20 144:2, 145:1; 148:32, 37, 149:64); and Gilg. IX ii 4 explains that scorpion-men observe the setting Sun by Mt. Masu, whose peak reaches up to supuk same. In this Gilgamesh passage, the Sun may move along supuk same before setting behind Mt. Masu. The term sipik same occurs in Proto-Kagal (Bilingual) (MSL 13 87:44), translating gis.be, and perhaps also in Babyl. 6 98:6 (see AHw 1245 5). The only known example of supuk burumu is Antagal G 224 (MSL 17227).32
pani same 'Face of Heaven'
The term pani same occurs in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions and astronomical omens. In these passages, pani same is a portion of the sky where the stars and moon are seen on clear nights. When the sky is not clear, pani same is said to be covered. Thus pani same must be the surface of the clear sky above the cloud cover. For instance, the 'face of heaven' is obscured by smoke from fires in the inscriptions of Sargon II (TCL 3 30:182; 32:198; 42:261, 268), by smoke and dust in the inscriptions of Sennacherib (OIP 2 40:80; 44:58-59), and by anqullu 'haze' in an astronomical omen (ACh Samas 147, see CAD A/2 144 b). In contrast, the visible 'face of heaven' shines like moonlight in an Old Babylonian astronomical omen: 33
[summa s]a-mu-u ki-ma $[i-i]t wa-ar-l:Ji-im pa-nu-su-nu
na-am-ru-u . .. T. Bauer, ZA 43 309:3-4
If the face of the heavens shines like moonlight ...
In AS 16286 rev. 23, pani same is contrasted with the Heaven of Anu above the sky (see p. 246).
31 For sapaky with mountains, clouds, and the sky, see CAD S/l 414-15 6'. 32 Note also Surpu 46:38: ... an. ur he.an.na '... horizon and "supuk same'" and AMT 1038 he.7.bi 'seven firmaments' (see p. 214). 33 For additional examples of pani same, see AHw 820 9 and AfO Beih. 22 287
rev. 10, where F. Rochberg-Halton translates 'the surface of the sky'.



242 Names for Heaven
an. bar
The term an.bar, another name for a portion of the visible heavens, is formed on the pattern an.za, an.ur, an.pa, and an.sa. The term occurs as a cosmic place-name in a hymn to NingiSzidda:
lugal ni.ri.a ildu utu.bi sag.ba gin.a an.bar an.ta a.ba sa.du.ne a.na an.da.sa.a TCL 15 pI. 113 rev. 6'-7' (J, van Dijk, Sumerische Gotterlieder 82:28-29)
Fearsome king, Sun-god of the host, who goes at the fore, at the ... above, who can equal you? What can rival you?
The term an.bar may be an opposite of an.sa since bar and sa are often oppo
sites meaning 'outside' and 'inside' (see PSD B 93, 96-98). If so, an.bar may be another name for the horizon, since an.sa refers to the center of the sky. A related term, an.bar.bar, may also occur as an opposite of an.sa in Gudea Cylinder A: 34
e.KAgid.da.bi an.bar.bar.ra nLgal.la.am e e.du14.la.bi nUll an.sa.ge diri.ga.am Gudea Cyl. A 25:2-4 (cf. PSD B 93 1)

The Geography of the Heavens
Introduction
Heaven is the upper of the two halves of the universe. In ancient Mesopotamia, as in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the heavens include both visible areas, where the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are seen, and higher regions above the sky, where gods of heaven dwelL Only the lists of KAR 307 and AO 8196 and Enuma. Elish provide clear evidence that the heavens consist of the sky and more than one level above the sky. In both KAR 307 and AO 8196, three heavens are listed: the Upper Heavens, belonging to Anu; the Middle Heavens of the Igigi above the sky; and the Lower Heavens (the sky) of the stars. KAR 307 adds that Marduk settled 300 Igigi in the Upper Heavens, that Bel sits in his cella in the Middle Heavens, and that Marduk drew stars on the Lower Heavens. The interior of Marduk's cella in the Middle Heavens is not seen from earth, but its blue saggilmud-stone floor may be visible as the blue sky (see p. 9). Below the heavens in KAR 307 there are three earths: the earth's surface, Apsu, and underworld. The area between the earth's surface and the stars is not listed in KAR 307 or AO 8196 but is part of the heavens in other texts. For instance, ~umerous passages speak of birds, clouds, and winds in the heavens (See CAD SII 345-47), so the region of the universe we call the "atmosphere" or "sky" was clearly part of heaven in ancient Mesopotamia. This interrelationship between heaven and the atmosphere is further illustrated by a passage from Lamastu, where dew is said to come from the stars: 1

In Enuma Elish, there are at least three heavens: the heaven that belongs to Anu, the Esarra of Enlil, and the level of the stars. Another cosmic placename, elatu, occurs in Ee V 11-12 as the region of the moon-god Nanna, and the term asrata occurs in Ee IV 141 and Ee V 121 as a name for a region of heaven or a feature of heaven (see p. 114). In addition, a number of Sumerian incantations, including me.se ba.da.dal, mayor may not preserve traditions of seven or more levels of heaven (see p. 220). Outside KAR 307, AO 8196, and Enuma Elish (and perhaps the Sumerian incantations), the heavens can be divided into two regions only: (1) the sky and (2) the region above the sky. In Sumerian literary texts, a region of heaven above the sky belonging to An is called an.sa, and a term an.un.na 'High Heaven' occurs in both lnanna and Sukkaletuda and the Kassite period Sumerian language work The Duties and Powers of the Gods. In Akkadian texts from the Middle Assyrian period onward, heavens above the sky are called "The Heaven of Anu." Although full geographies of the high heavens are not available much is known about these heavens from Akkadian texts, such as the fact that 'these heavens include gates, divine homes, and in Nergal and Ereskigal, a courtyard. The Heaven of Anu and high heavens in Akkadian texts are examined below. A study of parallel materials in Sumerian and bilingual works follows on pp. 247-49.
High Heavens in Akkadian Texts
The Heaven of Anu
In Enuma Elish, KAR 307, and AO 8196, the highest level of heaven belongs to Anu. Elsewhere, this heaven is identified as the "Heaven of Anu" (samu sa danim; samu danim).2 Additional evidence that the Heaven of Anu is the highest heaven is found in The Gilgamesh Epic and The Erra Epic. In Gilg. XI 113-14, gods ascend to the Heaven of Anu in order to escape the terror of the flood on the earth's surface below:
2 Following is a list of occurrences of the "Heaven of Anu": Gilg XI 114; Cagni Erra 74:153; JNES 15 134:67; Laessoe Bit Rimki 25 iii 51; Ebeling Handerhebung 30:2

Thompson Gilg. XI 113-14
The gods became frightened by the flood, so they departed, went up to the Heaven of Anu.
245
It is logical that gods escaping the flood would move as far away from the earth's surface as pOSSible, so the Heaven of Anu should be the most distant heaven from the earth's surface, the highest level of heaven. In Erra I, a cosmic mesu-tree reaches from the lowest earth, the underworld (arallu) , to the Heaven of Anu through the region of the heavens called elatu:
a-li gismesu Sir ilanimes si-mat sar gim-[ri] is-su el-lu et-lu! si-i-ru sa su-lu-ku a-na be-lu-ti
s'a'ina tam-tim ;apastim1im memes 100(1 ME) beru i-sid-su ik-su-fdu1 su-pul a-ra-al-[le-e]
qim-mat-su ina e-la-a-ti em-de-tu same e sa d[a-nim]
Cagni Erra 74:150-53
Where is the mesu-tree, the flesh of the gods, the emblem of the King of the Univ[erse], the pure tree, august hero, which is becoming to lordship, whose roots reach 100 leagues through the vast sea to the depth of the under[world], whose crown, in the heavens, leans on the Heaven of [Anu]?
The Heaven of Anu, in this context, must be the highest heaven, since the cosmic mesu-tree apparently stretched from the lowest earth to the highest heaven. In many sources, Anu shares his heaven with other gods. In KAR 307 30, Anu lives in the highest heavens with 300 Igigi. Lipsur (E. Reiner, JNES 15 134:67) also places Igigi in the Heaven of Anu. In Etana, Etana and the eagle ascend to the Heaven of Anu in search of !Star and apparently find !Star's home (see p. 58). Elsewhere, Bit Rimki (Laess0e Bit Rimki 25 iii 51') and a su,ila (Ebeling Handerhebung 30: 1 n. 5) call Gula asibat same danim 'Resident of the Heaven of Anu', and a supplicant calls out to the gods of the Heaven of Anu in Namburbi (E. Ebeling, RA 4940:5). Divine asse~blies take place in the Heaven of Anu in Nergal and Ereskigal (see p. 66) and Surpu:
ina u4-me an-ni-i ilanumes rabutumes a-si-bu samee da-nim ina pul:J,ri(ukkin)-su-nu lip-su-ru-[ka lip]-su-ru-ka
Surpu 43:78
On this day, let the great gods who reside in the Heaven of Anu rel[ease you and abs]olve you in their assembly.
In these texts, the Heaven of Anu apparently houses the heavenly pantheon. Gilgamesh XI and the lists of three heavens in AO 8196 and KAR 307, however, may imply that only Anu and his court lived in the Heaven of Anu,



246 The Geography of the Heavens
while other heavenly gods, such as the Igigi, lived in intermediate levels of heaven above the sky. In AO 8196 iv 20-22 and KAR 307 (Source A), Anu is placed in the Upper Heavens, while the Igigi are placed one level below in the Middle Heavens. In KAR 307 "Source B" 300 Igigi are placed in the highest heavens with Anu, and Bel's cella occupies the Middle Heavens. In Gilg. XI 113-14, gods ascend to the Heaven of Anu during the emergency created by the flood. These gods may have included divine refugees from both an intermediate level(s) of heaven, as well as from the earth's surface.
The Development of the Tradition of the Heaven of Anu
The only evidence for the term "Heaven of Anu" before the first millennium is found in a Middle Assyrian incantation:
... i-na pa-ni samee same e sa da-nim e-na x [ ...
W. G. Lambert, AS 16288 rev. i 23 (AS 16286 rev. 23)
... on the "face of heaven;' the Heaven of Anu ... [ ...
In Enuma Anu Enlil, atmospheric phenomena on the "face of heaven" is seen from the earth's surface (see p. 241), so the Heaven of Anu must be contrasted with pani same if the Heaven of Anu is a high heaven above the stars in this context. There is evidence for high heavens above the stars in other second-millennium texts, but these texts do not use the term "Heaven of Anu." In the Amarna version of Nergal and Ereskigal, Namtar ascends to the same $irilti 'majestic heavens' (EA 357:8) instead of the Heaven of Anu, as in the first-millennium Sultantepe and Uruk versions of the epic (AnSt 10 11052' n. 14; SpTU I 1 iii 9). An Old Babylonian example of Anu's heaven is found in the preserved portion of the prologue to Old Babylonian Etana (Kinnier Wilson Etana 30-31), where the emblems of kingship lie before Anu in heaven (samaJil). Another old example of Anu's heavens may be found embedded in Ee VI 37-44, where 300 Anunnaki are sent to dwell with Anu in heaven (samillsamamil). These 300 Anunnaki may be compared with the 300 Igigi that inhabit Anu's heaven in KAR 307. By the Middle Babylonian period, Igigi rather than Anunnaki are the gods of heaven, so Ee VI 37-44 presumably derives from an Old Babylonian
source. s
The Intermediate High Heavens
Intermediate heavens are found between the heaven that belongs to Anu, and the level of the stars in both KAR 307 and AO 8196, as well as in Enuma Elish. In KAR 307 (Source A) and AO 8196, a middle heavens belonging to the
3 See p. 5 n. 3.

Igigi is made of saggilmud-stone. KAR 307 (Source B) states that the cella of Bel was located in this heaven. In Enuma Elish, a region of heaven named Esarra belonging to Enlillies beneath Anu's heaven (samillsamamil).
Evidence for High Heavens in Sumerian Texts
an.sa
The term an.sa is translated qereb same 'the middle of heaven' in Antagal G 226 (MSL 17227) and the commentary 2R 47 ii 13. In Akkadian and bilingual texts, an.sa and qereb same often refer to a part of the sky (see pp. 23839). Nonetheless, evidence in Sumerian texts and the Sumerian portions of bilingual incantations indicate that an.sa is also a name for an interior region of heaven above the stars that may be compared with the Heaven of Anu.4 The clearest evidence for an.sa as a high region of heaven above the sky is found in a passage from The Curse of Agade, where Anu abandons Akkad for an.sa just as Enki leaves the city for his cosmic region, the Apsu:
me.lam an.ne im.us.sa.a.bi an.ne an.sa.ga ba.e.ell gisdargul.ku im.du.du.a.bi den.ki.ke4 abzu.a mi.ni.in.gid Cooper Curse of Agade 52:72-54:75
Its (Akkad's) aura, which leaned on heaven, Anu took up to "Heaven's Interior." Its well firmly planted mooring pole, Enki dragged into the Apsu.
"Heaven's Interior" is also the home of Anu in heaven in Sumerian hymns to Anu's viziers, Baba and Ninsubur (BL 195:4; UET 6/1 72:3; STVC 36:3, 9, 13), TCS 3 38:37l, and the Sumerian portion of the bilingual edition of Angimdimma:
ni me.lam an.na an.sa.ta sag.ga.es mu.un.rig7.ga
pu-lu/:J-ti me-Lam-me da-nu-um ina qe-reb same e ana si-rik-ti is-ruk-su Angim 66:70
4 No exact Sumerian equivalent of Akkadian samu danimlsamu sa danim is possible. Both the Sumerian equivalent of samu and danim are written with the AN sign, and a construct an.an.na would be ambiguous. In Akkadian texts, the two words are clearly differentiated, so the term "Heaven of Anu;' as well as the divine-name "Anu of the Heavens;' are possible. Note for example danum u dantum sa same in Racc~ 79:30, and the epithet of Sin 'f\nu of Heaven" (E. Ebeling, Or 23 213:9). See also CAD Sii 341 2'; OECT 11 p. 17 nn. 1-2; W. Farber, JNES 49 301.



248 The Geography of the Heavens
Sum.: (Ninurta) who was given the fearsome splendor of Anu as a gift in "Heaven's Interior." Akk.: Anu granted him fearsome splendor as a gift in the "middle of heaven."
In these passages, there is no reason to place Anu's home among the stars or at the same level as the sun, moon, and clouds. Thus an.sa here, like the Akkadian Heaven of Anu, must be Anu's region of heaven above the sky. Other evidence identifies an.sa with a night resting place of the sun. In an incantation that was to be recited at sunset, the Sun-god enters an.sa: 5
dutu an.sa.se kU4.ku4.da.zu.de
(dsamas) ana qe-reb sa-me-e ina e-re-bi-ka
giss i.gar.ku.an.na.ke4 silim.ma hu.mu.ra.ab.be

da-la-at sa-me-e lik-ru-ba-a-kum
Abel-Winckler 59 no. 2 1-6
o Sun-god, when you enter "Heaven's Interior;' may the bolt of the clear heavens say "hello." May the doors of the heavens bless you.
In this context, the Sun apparently sets into an.sa after passing through the gates of heaven. In a second incantation, the Sun rises from an.sa:
en.gal an.sa.ku.ga.ta [ej.zu.de
be-lum rabilli is-tu qe-reb sarn,ie [ellilti i]na a-si-ka ur.sag suI dutu an.sa.ku.ga.ta [ej.zu.de

. 4R 17:1-4
Great Lord, when you rise from clear "Heaven's Interior;' hero, youth, Shamash, when you rise from clear "Heaven's Interior;'
Thus, according to one Sumerian tradition, the Sun-god apparently spent the night in an.sa instead of passing under the earth's surface through the Apsu or underworld. It is not clear, though, how the Sun-god might have passed from the western to eastern horizon at night through an.sa.6 Thus, it is not surprising

an.un.na
In "Duties and Powers of the Gods" (Sumer 4 pi. I ii 6'-11'; see p. 143), an. un. n a houses Igigi, suggesting that this region is a high, unseen level of heaven. This literary work, however, was written during the Kassite period, so this example of an.un.na, cannot prove a third-millennium Sumerian tradition of high heavens. Additional examples of the term, however, occur in the traditional Sumerian literary work Inanna and Sukalletuda: 8
sig.se igi mu.:il an.un.na kur.utu.e.ke4.ne igi bLdu8
nim.se igi mu.:il an.un.na kur.utu.Su.ke4.ne igi bLdu8

He (Sukalletuda) lifted the eye eastwards and looked at the high heaven by the mountain of sunrise. He lifted the eye westwards and looked at the high heaven by the mountain of sunset. He gazed at the shining? distant heaven. In the distant heaven he understood the sign.
Although Sukalletuda sees an.un.na by mountains of sunrise and sunset, an. un.na in this passage might still be a region of heaven above the sky, since Adapa is able to see the visible parts of heaven isid same and elM same (horizon and zenith) while standing in Anu's heaven in Adapa D:7-8 (Piccioni Adapa 122). Sumerian an.bad.ra 'distant heaven' must be visible from earth in Inanna and Sukalletuda, since it provides Sukalletuda with a sign.
earth upon setting." This argument, although appealing, contradicts the many texts where the Sun and Moon are placed in the underworld at night (see, for example, p. 352) and passages where Anu's abode in heaven is placed in an.sa in Sumerian literature. 7 Cf. R. Borger, Or 5416:11-12: an.sa.ku.ga = samu elliltu. 8 Note also an.un.na in BE 3127:14-15:

9 K. Yolk (Inanna und Sukaletuda, 177) interprets this passage and parallels in a different manner.



250 The Geography of the Heavens
The Geography of the High Heavens
Very little is known about the interior of the Heaven of Anu or the other high heavens. The only evidence for the interior of the Heaven of Anu is found in Nergal and Ereskigal and Etana. In Nergal and Ereskigal, the assembly of the gods convenes in a courtyard named kisal danim 'courtyard of Anu'. In this same text, a gate to the Heaven of Anu is named "Gate of Anu, Enlil, and Ea;' and this gate is reached by ascending the simmelat samam'l 'stairway of heaven':
i-la-a rdnaml-tar dr-kat sisim-me-lat sd-m[a-mi]
ana bab da-nim den-lil u de-a ina ka-[sd-di]
da-nim den-lil u de-a e-mu-ru-s[u!-ma]
STT 28 v 42'-44'
d[na]m-tar ana ki-sal-li da-nim e-ru-u[b-ma]
Namtar ascended the long stairway of hea[ven.] When he arr[ived] at the Gate of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, Anu, Enlil, and Ea sa[w him] (and said ...) "Namtar ente[r] into the courtyard of Anu."
STT 28 v 47'
In Etana, Etana and the eagle fly to the Heaven of Anu and enter through the Gate of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, and Gate of Sin, Samas, Adad, and Btar on their way to find a windowless home of Btar that Etana has seen in a dream (see p. 58). This information suggests that the Heaven of Anu was a great temple complex complete with a courtyard, gates, and shrines to house important gods. Such a tradition may have developed by analogy to the underworld, which also has a courtyard, gates, and divine homes (see p. 350-49). In Adapa, Anu also lives in a high heaven beyond a road to heaven named J;arran same 'Path of Heaven' and a gate called "Gate of Anu" (see p. 65), but the term "Heaven of Anu" is not used.
Divine Abodes in Heaven
In both Sumerian and Akkadian texts, gods live in the high part of heaven above the sky. In KAR 307 32-33, a dais of Bel is located in the middle heavens. Parallel divine cellas and daises above the sky are found in a number of texts. In bilingual passages, Inanna/Btar sits on the dais of Anu in heaven: lO

Other passages refer to a solar cella in an unseen portion of heaven above the sky where the Sun-god passes the night. In a Sumerian hymn to Inanna, Inanna as Venus shines in the sky after the Sun enters his cella at sunset:
dutu agrun.na.se kU4.ra.a.ba dinanna i.zi.gim an.ta im.gur.ru.a.zu.de BE 31 12 rev. 24-25
After Utu goes into his cella, Inanna, like a fire, you are raised up high.
In parallel Old Babylonian Prayers to the Gods of the Night, the Sun-god enters his cella before the stars come out:
da-a-a-an ki-it-tim a-bi ki-it-tim dsamas i-te-ru-ub a-na ku-um-mi-su
RA 32181:14-15 (cf. 180:12-13)
The Judge of Truth, Father of Truth, Shamash has gone into his cella.
Earlier, both prayers call the night-resting place of the Sun utul same 'lap of heaven' (RA 32180:7, 181:7). In GHT 47-49 and 91-93, Utu leaves his cella when he rises at dawn, and a star apparently rises from a cella at the horizon in Namburbi: 11

then rises the next morning. R. Caplice (OrNs 42 299-305) suggests that agrun is a name for the Apsu in these contexts.



252 The Geography of the Heavens
her golden heavenly cella, but the Assyrian king can only see a light of elmesustone:
I have established your (Esarhaddon's) throne below the great heavens. From the golden cella in the midst of heaven I will keep watch over you. I will make a light of elmesu-stone shine before Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria. 4R2 61 iii 29-35; see p. 13)
The light of elmesu-stone in !Star's cella may be compared with the elmeSustone in Bel's cella in KAR 307 33. This, however, is problematic, because the goddesses' throne in the interior of the heavenly cella was not visible from earth. A possible solution to this problem might be that the light inside the cella shone through a window and was therefore visible from earth, while the interior of the cella was not visible. Yet, Etana and the eagle apparently find that !Star's heavenly cella has no window in The Etana Epic (see pp. 50-51). Similar problems arise in a hymn to Sin, where the throne of the Moon-god is located in the samu ellutu 'clear heavens' (Perry Sin 5a:2-5c:16), and a su.fla to Shamash, where the Sun-god sits on a dais in the samu ellutu (KAR 55:1-2; Ebeling Handerhebung 52). Such passages, where the Sun, Moon, and goddess Venus (!Star) are visible in their shrines even when their shrines are not visible, demonstrate that the visible and non-visible heavens were not always totally separate in Mesopotamian thought.
The Visible Heavens (The Sky)
The Heavens of the Stars, Sun, Moon, and Planets
Sumerian and Akkadian texts preserve three' systems for describing the geography of the sky. First, Akkadian texts speak of paths of the heavens belonging to the stars and the seven ancient planets (udu.idim = bibbu): the Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Second, both Sumerian and Akkadian texts refer to a system of dividing the heavens into quadrants that may be compared with the four quarters of the earth's surface. Third, a number of Sumerian terms and their Akkadian equivalents are used as names for various portions of the sky. These include an.ur = isid same 'Horizon' and an.pa = eldt same 'Zenith' (see pp. 233-42). In Mesopotamian texts, no region of heaven exists between the earth's surface and the level of the stars, sun, and moon for lesser astronomical objects such as comets or shooting stars. For example, the term kakkabu 'star' applies to meteors as well as fixed stars (see CAD K 48 2).
The Paths of the Heavens. The division of the visible heavens into paths (l:Jarranu) is the most common system in astronomical texts. In these texts, the term usually refers to bands of the sky reaching from the eastern to western horizon. Both "The Astrolabes" and Mul-Apin divide the sky into three stellar
The Visible Heavens (The Sky) 253
paths that cross the sky from the eastern to western horizon: a northern path belonging to Anu, a central path belonging to Enlil, and a southern path belonging to Ea. The Moon and Sun-gods use similar paths, called "The Path of Sin" and "The Path of Shamash;' on their way across the sky:

The Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. The "Astrolabes" and star-catalogue of Mul-Apin (Mul-Apin I i 1-ii 35) list Anu, Enlil, and Ea-stars that travel along the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea over the course of the year. These paths are also mentioned in many other astronomical and astrological texts where, on occasion, the positions of astronomical phenomena are defined in terms of the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea-stars. For example, CT 41 23:10-12 states that a misl:Ju and a sallummu 'comet' move from the Path of Anu to the Path of Enlil; Parpola LAS I' 290 notes that Jupiter has moved from the sector (qaqqaru) of mu1si pa. zi.an.na (Orion) in the Path of Anu to the sector of mulgisgigir (,The Chariot') in the Path of Enlil; Borger Esarh. 2 i 37-ii 9 reports that Venus and Mars appeared in the Path of Ea; and Enuma Anu Enlil preserves numerous protases where Venus or other planets stand in one of the three stellar paths: 12

This demonstrates that Mesopotamian astronomers used the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea to locate heavenly bodies in the sky, just as modern astronomers use degrees of latitude and longitude. In Mul-Apin II, the location of the Sun in the sky over the course of the year is explained in terms of the three stellar paths:
l. From the 1st of Adar to the 30th of Iyar, the Sun travels in the Path of Anu; breeze and warm weat[her]. 3. From the 1st of Sivan to the 30th of Ab, the Sun travels in the Path of Enlil; harvest and heat. 5. [Fr]om the 1st of Elul to the 30th of Aragsamnu, the Sun travels in the Path of Anu; breeze and warm weather. 7. [From the 1s]t of Kislev to the 30th of Shevat, the Sun travels in the Path of Ea; cold weather. Mul-Apin II Gap A 1-7 (see p. 173)
Here the Sun is said to travel through the Path of Anu during the spring and autumn seasons, the Path of Enlil in summer, and Path of Ea in winter, demonstrating that the day sky, as well as the night sky, was divided into Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. This system of dividing the sky into Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea was well known in the first millennium. References and allusions to the Paths of Anu Enlil, and Ea are found outside astronomical and astrological works in literar; contexts, including Ee V 1-8, a Prayer to the Gods of the Night (A. Falkenstein, AnBi 12 284:43-44), an incantation from Sultantepe (STT 73:92-94), and Assurbanipal's Acrostic Hymn to Marduk and Zarpanitum, where Marduk establishes bnrranu 'paths' and malaku 'courses' in the sky for the constellations (SM 3 9 no. 2 rev. 8-9).13 Such literary allusions demonstrate that non-astronomers were familiar with the practice of dividing the visible heavens into Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. The earliest evidence for the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea dates to the second millennium. The final portion of a Boghazkoi version of a Babylonian "Prayer to the Gods of the Night" lists 17 stars belonging to Ea and refers to stars of Ea, Anu, and Enlil (KUB 4 47 rev. 43-48; see p. 158). However, this prayer does not use the term J;arranu. The earliest surviving evidence for J;arranu itself dates to the late second millennium; the Middle Babylonian "forerunner" to the "Astrolabes" HS 1897 from Jena and the slightly later Middle Assyrian Astrolabe KAV 218 (Astrolabe B; see pp. 158-59). Nevertheless, the fact that stars maintain regular courses must have been observed in very early times.

The Visible Heavens (The Sky) 255
Although no text ever explicitly states that the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea together comprise the entire sky, this may be inferred from a passage in a NeoAssyrian Prayer to the Gods of the Night that parallels KUB 4 47:
kakkab dIMsuti(ul u) d 1Miltani(si.sa) d 1Msade(kur) d1Mamurri(mar) su-pu-tu4 kakkabanumes a-J;u-tu4 sa i-ni la i-mu-ru-su-nu-tu

Star of the north, south, east, and west, brillant stars, others which the eye has not seen, which observers or non-observers have not observed, those of Anu, I cry out to you. Those of Enlil turn to me. Those of Ea, all of you, gather around me.
In this context, all of the visible stars in heaven seem to be included among the stars of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. 14 The stars that have not been seen are probably
14 Note a nearly identical passage in STT 73:92-94. The Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea may also be said to comprise the entire heavens in two obscure passages in Enuma Anu Enlil:
mU1e.tur.ra dim.ma.an.na [dull.ga]
a-na nap-l:Jar samee DIM: na[p-l:Ja-ru (..)] a-na bi-nu-ut same e i-qab-bi BPO 2 42:22-22a
The "Caule-pen"-star, all of Heaven [so it is said] for all of Heaven. DIM means tot[ality (..)], so it says, for the creatures of heaven.
l:Jarran dsamas se-pi-it tarba$i(tur) su-ut dea(dis) l:Jarran dsamas m[i-sil ta]rba$i su-ut da-nu harran dsamas res brt tarbasi(e.tur)

The Path of the Sun at the foot of the cattle-pen belongs to Ea. The Path of the Sun in the m[iddle of the calttle-pen belongs to Anu. The Path of the Sun at the head of the cattle-pen belong[s to Enlil ...
In the first passage, the entire heavens (napl:Jar same) seems to be a cattle-pen for the creatures of heaven (i.e., the stars). In the second passage, the cosmic cattle-pen seems to be divided into thirds, with each third representing one of the three astronomical paths. The Path of Ea in the south is at the bottom, the Path of Anu in the center of the sky is in the middle of the cattle-pen, and the Path of Enlil in the north is at the top of the cattle-pen. However, a parallel places the Path of Ea at the top of the cattle-pen and the Path of Enlil at the bottom (see BPO 2 43 n. 24b). The Path of the Sun crosses into all three paths, as in Mul-Apin II (see p. 173). As noted by W. Heimpel (Fest. Sjoberg 249
52), the cattle of the sky in this context, as in Sumerian literature, are the stars. If so, the identification of the "cattle-pen" with only the eastern horizon in BPO 2 p. 17 2.2.1.2.1 must be abandoned, since stars are found throughout the sky. For a further reference to stars behaving like cattle in The Exaltation of Istar, see p. 145. For a previous study of the cattle-pen (viehhof) of the stars, see Koch Neue Untersuchungen 119-32.

lesser stars that are not very bright or stars that have yet to rise or already set. Although unseen, the powers of such stars could still have been helpful.
Astronomical Lines of Latitude, Meridians, and Stellar Sectors. The Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea themselves were divided into stellar zones. On the circular Astrolabes, the sky is divided into 36 zones by "latitudinal lines" marking the borders of the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea and "longitudinal meridians" marking the beginnings and ends of the months. In Ee V I-S, Marduk draws mi$ratu 'boundary lines' when he arranges the stars of the "Astrolabe" in Ee V I-S. Grids of heavenly lines and meridians, such as those drawn on the circular Astrolabes, establish stellar sectors in the sky. Evidence for such stellar sectors is found in Mul-Apin and other texts from the first millennium where the terms qaqqaru 'area' and pirku 'sector' refer to areas of the sky surrounding important stars. Likewise, in the late period the positions of the stars of the zodiac and normal stars were used to define sectors of the sky called ba.la = zittuJ5
The Paths of the Moon, Sun, and Planets. The Moon, Sun, and planets move over the course of the year in relation to the fixed-stars. Both the terms Path of Sin and Path of Shamash, like the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, refer to fixed bands in the sky. In Mul-Apin I iv 31-39, the closing section of Mul-Apin I, the Path of Sin Caarran dsin) is explained in terms of IS stars (see p. 171). According to this list, the Moon moves through the stellar paths in the annual sequence Anu-Enlil-Anu-Ea-Anu. The term Path of Shamash (aarran dsamaS) occurs as a fixed band in the sky in astronomical reports and omens where stars reach (kasadu) the Path of Shamash at night (i.e., enter into the course that the Sun follows during the day).16 Likewise, in Ee V 21-22, the Moon-god is commanded to approach (sutaqrib) the Path of Shamash on the last day of the lunar month (um bubbulim), where neither the Sun nor Moon is seen in the sky at night. The opening section of Mul-Apin II identifies the Path of Shamash and the paths of the planets with the Moon's path:
of the starry sky as a cattle-pen may proVide indirect evidence that the sky was perceived as a dome. The original pictograph of the TlJR (cattle-pen) sign includes a dome-shaped element (see Labat 87a), suggesting that some cattle-pens had dome-shaped roofs that might have been comparevd with the apparent dome of the sky. For the "head" and "foot" of the sky, see also CAD S/2 294 e. 15 For qaqqaru = 'stellar sector', see p. 166; SpTU I 94; AfO Beih. 22 219 EAE 20 Text a, 285:29. Compare also the later 12 ga.la = zittu 'parts' of the microzodiac (AfO
Beih. 22 39 n. 24; F. Rochberg-Halton, JAOS 108 57-60). For boundary lines and meridians in the sky, compare also TCL 6 14 37-rev. 4 where planets stand (are stationary) on tallu 'dividing lines', DUR (= riksu, turru) 'bands, ropes', and MLsIR (perhaps a writ
ing for mi$ir; see A. Sachs, JCS 6 74). Compare also DUR in TCL 613 ii 7-8, rev. ii 1-20 (F. Rochberg-Halton, ZA 77 212-15, cf. 222-24). Lines are also established in the sky by
joining stars to form qu 'ropes' in BM 78161 (D. Pingree and C. Walker, Fest. Sachs 313
22). For tallu and zittu on sundials, see F. Rochberg-Halton, Centaurus 32 164-65. 16 See E. Weidner, AfO 7 175-77; SAA 8 49 rev. 4, 230:5-6; BPO 2 39 n. II 13b, SpTU I 90 rev. 8.

The path which the Moon goes in, the Sun goes along. The path which the Moon goes in, Jupiter goes along. The path which the Moon goes in, Venus goes along. The path which the Moon goes in, Mars goes along. The path which the Moon goes in, the planet Mercury, whose name is Ninurta, gores along]. The path which the Moon goes in, the planet Saturn goes along. Mul-Apin II i 1-6 (see pp. 171-72)
257
The Moon's Path is itself defined by the IS stars in the Path of Sin in the immediately preceeding closing section of Mul-Apin I. Thus, the paths of the Sun and the five modern planets in Mul-Apin II, like the Path of Sin in Mul-Apin I, crosses the boundaries between the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea. Later in MulApin II, the Sun is said to travel in different stellar paths during different seasons of the year (see pp. 172-73). In a few other texts, the paths of the Sun, Moon, and planets are called talaktu 'course' or malaku 'way' rather than aarranu 'path'. Parallel terms "Way of the Moon" and "Way of the Sun" occur in Late Babylonian astronomical texts (ACT 200 i 20; 0. Neugebauer and A. Sachs, JCS 21202 rev. 23-24, cf. 201 S, 15, 20), while the courses of the Sun, Moon, and planets are called tallaktu in E. Reiner and D. Pingree, AfO 25 52 rev. ii 1, 13. In Assurbanipal's Acrostic Hymn to Marduk and Sarpanitum, both "ways" and "paths" of constellations reach from east to west:
ina $itas(cIs.NIM) u silan(cIs.sU) lu-mas-si us-rziz-ma1 aar-ra-nu ma-la-[ku i]s-ruk-su-nu-ma u-[ x x x x x x ]
Craig ABRT I 32 rev. 9 (SAA 3 9)
In the east-sky and west-sky he set up the constellations, provided them with paths and way[sl, and. [ ...... ]17
On other occasions, however, aarranu seems to be used with the sense of the course of the Sun or planets in the sky at a given time, rather than a fixed band of the sky. For example, cloud formations (nidu) stand in the "Path of the Sun" in two of four omens in Thompson Reports 182 (= SAA S 401) and the path of the rising Sun in a third: 18

258 The Geography of the Heavens
stars returning to their original positions each year. Thus each path should consist of 360 degrees. As noted on p. 186, this may be confirmed for the Path of Enlil in both the ziqpu-star text BM 38369+ and the blessing formula from Sultantepe, STT 340:12. In the Neo-Assyrian astronomical text AfO 25 52 rev. ii 1-4, the daily course (talaktu) of the Sun is also described as a circle (see pp. 190-91). In AO 6478, the Path of Enlil is 364 degrees long, instead of 360 degrees, but this slight anomaly reflects the author's intention to provide a better approximation of the true astronomical year of 365~ days (see p. 185). Nevertheless, there is no direct statement in any surviving text that circles of the Paths of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, or Sin and Shamash, extended beneath the earth's surface, although this may be inferred from ziqpu-star texts, where the Path of Enlil is 360° or 364° long, and from Astrolabe B Section D, where most of the Anu, Enlil, and Ea-stars rise on the eastern horizon six months (180 days = 180°) after setting on the western horizon. The width of the "Way of the Moon" (malak dsin) is provided in late astronomical texts. In ACT 200 this figure is said to be 12 degrees:
epesu(du)Sll sa NIM u SIG sa sin(30) ar[w(ab) ana arbi(ab) 12 DAGAL ma-lak dsin(30)
ACT 200 i 20 (cf. SpTU I 94 20-21)
The procedure for (determining) the positive and negative latitude of the Moon month by month. 12 (degrees) is the width of the "Way of the Moon."
An equivalent measurement in cubits (6 kus) is provided in parallel texts (JCS 21 201:8, 15,20; JCS 21 202 BM 33739 rev. 2), This total of 12° represents the maximum north-south deviation of the course of the Moon over the 18-year lu
nar cycle. 19 Only the length of the Path of Enlil is measured in surviving texts. In the ziqpu-star text AO 6478, ziqpu-stars that circumambulate the Path of Enlil travel 655,200 leagues (see p. 186).
The Movement of Heavenly Bodies. No text explains in detail how the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets move through the sky. In KAR 307, the stars are said to be inscribed upon the lower jasper heavens. As noted on p. 15, stars inscribed onto the stone floor of heaven would not have been able to move independently. Thus, the author of KAR 307 may have explained that stars appear to move in the night sky because the entire sky rotated. Such a cosmographic belief could not explain the independent motion of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, or shooting stars, nor could it explain why circumpolar stars remained above the horizon throughout the year while other stars rose and set.20

The Visible Heavens (The Sky) 259
The Four Quadrants of Heaven. The tradition of the four quadrants of heaven parallels the tradition of the four quadrants of the earth's surface. This tradition in heaven is illustrated by Mul-Apin II i 68-71 (see pp. 172-73), where the constellations Ursa Major, PiscisAustrinus, Scorpio, and the Pleiades are said to lie across the north, south, east, and west winds. Other examples of this tradition include Surpu II 165-67 and Prayers to the Gods of the Night, which refer to stars of the four winds (A. Oppenheim, AnBi 12 283:40; OECT 6 75:16). A diagram of the four quadrants of heaven may be found on BagM Beih. 2 no. 98 where triangles labelled "Southwind" and "Westwind" are placed in the corners of a square above and below the label "sunrise." The placement of these triangles suggests that the four quadrants of the heavens were equal triangles rather than four equal squares (see p. 194).21
The tradition of the four quadrants of heaven may also be illustrated by two Sumerian passages where Venus shines in the sky. In a hymn to Inanna, the goddess is said to shine in u b.an:
nam.dingir.zu dnanna dutu.gim an.ku.ge dalla.e izi!.gar.zu ub.an.na zalag.ge kukku zalag.ge.es gar A. Sj0berg, ZA 65198:209-10 (cf. 206 n. 210)
Your divinity, like the Moon and Sun, is resplendent in the clear heavens. Your torch shines in the "Corner of heaven", turns darkness into light.
The Duties and Powers of the Gods preserves a parallel passage, with an.u b instead of ub.an:
21 For the four winds in astrology, see AfO Beih. 22 57-60. Note also SAA 8 33435 and Sachs-Hunger Diaries I 118 -372:11: is]tu MURUB4 same ana SrI ... 'fr]om the "center of heaven" to the nor[th ...'

So that Venus would waft in heaven, to make her go down in "earth", to make her burn from "Heaven's Corner" through the entire atmosphere? ...22
The term an.ub also also occurs in The Kesh Temple Hymn paralleling ki.ub: ga.nun ga.ra.bi an.ub ki.ub (TCS 3173:96). Both u b.an and an. u b are probably variations of Sumerian names for the the four quadrants of the earth's surface, an.ub.da.limmu.ba and ub.da. limmu.ba. The term an.ub is formed on the same pattern as an.ur, an.pa, and an.sa, while u b.an is similar to the term u b.da.an.ki, which occurs in two Sumerian hymns see p. 299). A related Akkadian geographical term, kippat sar erbetti 'Circle of the Four Winds', occurs in an epithet of Adad and The TukultiNinurta Epic (see p. 206; CAD K 399 kippatu 3d).23 A number of other passages demonstrate the close affinities between heavenly and earthbound geography. These include Sargon Geography 31, where Sargon rules all the lands sil;ip same 'under heaven' (see p. 86); passages in first millennium royal inscriptions where kings claim dominion from "horizon to zenith" (see p. 330); and the Sumerian phrase mul.mul.kur.kur. ra 'stars of the lands', which occurs in an incantation (LKA 145:4 II AMT 104:19).
Parts of the Sky. A repertoire of equivalent Sumerian and Akkadian terms are used as names for parts of the sky. These terms, including Sumerian an.ur, an.pa, and giS.be, and their Akkadian counterparts isid same, eldt same, and supuk same, are examined on pp. 233-42. The repertoire of terms represents a traditional means for expressing the geography of the heavens, rather than a scientifically based system, and as such does not refer to welldefined parts of the sky.
The "Atmosphere." The area between the stars and earth's surface is not considered a separate level of the universe in KAR 307. Other texts, however, demonstrate that this space is a part of heaven, and there is some evidence that this space had its own geography and perhaps even a Sumerian name. Two Assyrian texts speak of kippatu 'circles' of the winds, which may be compared with the kippat same 'circle of heaven' and kippat burume 'circle of
22 For lil as a possible name for the atmosphere, see below. The verb sig is understood as a phonetic variant for sig with the general meaning sapalu 'to be low, to go
down'. For tab = bnmatu 'to glow, to burn', see CAD t£ 64. 23 The division of the heavens into eight sectors is attested in !he planisphere CT 33 10 (Koch Neue Untersuchungen 56-61). Cf. Lugale 77 and CAD S/2 136 saru A2 for Lyon Sar. 10:66, 17:82.

the sky' in heaven.24 In the inscriptions of Shalmaneser III, Adad is said to hold
the kippat sare 'circle of the winds' 0. V. Kinnier Wilson, Iraq 24 93:4). In The Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, the Assyrian king excercises control over the kippat sar erbetti 'circle of the four winds' (Machinist TN Epic 66 1A:13). This 'circle of the winds' may be illustrated by the circle enclosing the square with triangles labeled "Southwind" and "Westwind" on BagM Beih. 2 no. 98. Sumerian lil may be used as a name for the level of the winds between heaven and earth. In The Duties and Powers of the Gods, the glow of Venus in heaven seems to shine in 1i 1:
. .. an.ub.ta da.gan lil.da ba.tab.ba Sumer 4 pI. IV vii 25'-29' (see p. 260)
... to make her (Venus) burn from "Heaven's Corner" through the entire atmosphere(?)
This sense of lil also fits the name of the god Enlil, perhaps literally 'lord of the open space'. Enlil, as the ruler of the earth's surface, would have been responsible for the open space above his region. The source of winds is never fully explained in Mesopotamian texts. One possibility is that winds were believed to issue out of the heavens and underworld and then to blow into Mesopotamian from the edges of the earth's surface. Wind-blown demons come from heaven and the underworld, and winds are said to blow in from an.ur 'the horizon' in an "Incantation of the Wind" (OECT 5 23:1-4; see p. 204).25
24 For kippatu in cosmic contexts, see CAD K 399 and J. V Kinnier Wilson, Iraq 24 100-101. 25 Note, for example, the opening lines of The Moon-God and the Demons, where wind-demons are born in ul.ge = supuk sa1'l1R (CT 16 19 i 1-5). In the World Map of Claudius Ptolemy, winds blow from an area beyond a cosmic ocean that extends to the ends of the earth's surface. For a reproduction of this map, see E. L. Stevenson (ed.), Geography of Claudius Ptolemy. In the Book of Enoch, portals and treasuries of the winds are found at the ends of the earth (see Charles Apocrypha II Enoch 18:34-36, 41, 76.



262 The Geography of the Heavens
The Composition of the Heavens
There are two traditions concerning the composition of the heavens. According to one tradition, the heavens are made of water. In the second, the heavens are made of stone.
Water
Explicit statements that the heavens are made of water are found in Babylonian texts. Examples include Ee IV 137-46, where Marduk builds the heavens out of part of the watery corpse of Tiamat, and Inamgisuranki, where the Akkadian name for heaven, same, is explained as sa me 'of water' (Livingstone 32:6; see p. 224). In Ee IV 139-40, Marduk stretches out a skin and assigns guards to keep the waters of heaven from draining downward onto lower regions of the universe. These traditions may be compared with Genesis 1, where the primeval waters are divided in two, with the upper waters positioned above the firmament (:I7'v1), and Psalms 104:3 and 148:4, which speak of waters above the heavens. The tradition of watery heavens almost certainly derives from the observation that waters fell from the heavens in the form of precipitation. This observation is reflected by close connections between Sumerian and Akkadian names for heaven and words for 'rain'. In Sumerian, the word for 'rain' seg is written with a diri-compound that includes the Sumerian name for heaven, an: A.AN ('water of the sky') (see CAD Z 160-61). As noted earlier, Akkadian samu 'heavens' (plural) is related to a common word for precipitation samulsamuml *sam{Jum, pl. sam{Jatu, samatu.
The phenomenon of rainfall is explained in different ways. In the Lamastu incantation 4R2 58 II PBS I12 113, dew is connected in some way with the stars (see p. 244). In Sumerian texts, rain issues out of cosmic teats called u bur.an.na 'teat of heaven', which serve as rain ducts in the sky. In a royal hymn to Rim-Sin, the opening of these ducts results in rainfall:
ubur.an.sud.aga gal bu.mu.ra.ab.tag4 segx(IM.A) .an.na bu.mu.ra.ab.seg UET 6/1 102:23 (SteibIe Rim-Sin 6)
May he open the teat of the elmesu heavens, may he make the rain of heaven rain down.
Because sud.aga = elmesu (see CAD E 107), the surface of the heavens appears to be made of elmesu-stone, and rain water may be stored in reservoirs above. Additional examples of the "teat of heaven" are found in the Vase Inscription of Lugalzagesi (BE I12 87 iii 27-28), a Rim-Sin inscription (RIM 4 272:6), a hymn to Nanna (A. Sj0berg, ZA 6332:24), and a passage in a hymn to Enki:
ubur.an.na.ke4 gal bu.mu.na.ab.tag4[ ... J buru14·bi
be.na.[ ... A. Sjoberg, JCS 29 31 B i 7 (photo ZA 63 50 no. 2)
May he open the "teat of heaven" for him, may he ... the harvest [ ...
The Composition of the Heavens 263
In this last passage, the opening of the "teat of heaven" apparently provides rain for the harvest. Thus, the "teat of heaven" seems to provide life-sustaining rain
waters, just as human and animal teats provide mother's milk.26 Sumerian ubur.an.na may have an Akkadian equivalent. Some examples of the term $erret same, translated by CAD 135 4 as 'lead-rope of heaven', may in fact represent $erret same 'breasts of heaven', with serret understood as a
plural construct of $irtu 'breast' written with doubled r (~ote, for instance, Ee I 85 $er-ret). Examples where the meaning 'breasts of heaven' is more appropriate than 'lead-rope of heaven' include passages in an Agum II inscription and a
late hymn to Marduk: 27

W. Lambert, AfO 19 61:9-10
[Who raJins down dew from the breasts of heaven,
[ .. 1.wind and raindrops over the fields.
The tradition that the heavens are made of stone is found in KAR 307 and AO 8196, where the floors of the three heavens are made of luludanitu-stone
saggilmud-stone, and jasper, and the Rim-Sin hymn that refers to elmesu-ston~ heavens (Steible Rim-Sin 6:23; see above). The tradition of stone heavens may derive from an observation that certain heavenly objects were the same color as minerals. For instance, Sirius shines like copper in the inscriptions of TiglathPileser I (AKA 140:15), and a shooting star is said to shine like zaginduru (lapis or lapis-colored glass) in astronomical omens (S. Langdon, Babyl. 7233:20-21). The identification of astronomical bodies with stones, although probably originally based simply on color, may have lead to a tradition that the heavens themselves were composed of stone. Such a belief might have been confirmed by finding stone meteors that fell from the sky.28

lapis-lazuli (see pp. 166-68).



264 The Geography of the Heavens
The Size of the Heavens
Mesopotamians believed that the heavens were extremely broad and high. In many contexts, the heavens are said to be vast (dagal = rapsu), and a number of texts make it clear that the heavens extended over the entire earth's surface. Twice, in Etana and in AO 6478, the immense size of heaven is expressed in measured units. In Etana, Etana and the eagle fly upward for six leagues without reaching the top of the heavens, and AO 6478 states that a circumnavigation of the Path of Enlil entails a voyage of 655,200 leagues (see p. 186). In CT 46 55, an even larger figure of 1,432,000 is recorded as the distance between asurrakku and earth, but the meaning of asurrakku in this context is not certain (see pp. 178-79).
The Shape of the Heavens
The visible heavens were thought to be circular in shape, since the clear sky appears to be a giant circle. Textual evidence for this belief is found in the terms kippat burume 'circle of the sky' (see pp. 226-27) and kippat same 'circle of heaven'; the latter occurs in two hymns to the Sun-god:
za.e zalag.ga.ta sag.kul su.da an.na.ta
aHa-ma nu-ur-su-nu sa kip-pat samee ru-qu-u-tu4
4R 19 no. 2:51-52
You are their (mankind's) light in the circle of the distant heavens (Sum. distant bolt of heaven) 29
[mus-te-s]ir nise mes sa kip-pat same e [at-tal v
K. 2830:3 (Gray Samas pI. III, Bit Rimki)
[You are the direc]tor of people in the circle of heaven
Further evidence for the circular shape of the sky may be found in the circular shape of Assyrian planispheres (CT 33 10-12), the circle enclosing the winds in BagM Beih. 2 no. 98, and the terms kippat sare 'circle of the winds' and kippat sar erbetti 'circle of the four winds' (see p. 260). Although the clear sky seems to us to be shaped like a dome, rather than a flat circle, there is no direct evidence that ancient Mesopotamians thought the visible heavens to be a dome. Akkadian kippatu are always flat, circular objects such as geometric circles or hoops, rather than three dimensional domes. Nonetheless, evidence for dome-shaped, or curved, heavens may be found in the ziqpu-star text BM 38693+, the blessing formula STT 340:12, and AO 6478, where the Path of Enlil is 3640 long. All three imply that the Path of Enlil, at least, is a curved band that encircles the earth's surface (see p. 258). However,
29 gissag.kul = sikkilru 'bolt' (see CAD S 256).
The Bonds of Heaven 265
this does not prove that the surface of heaven is curved, since stars need not have necessarily traveled along the surface of the sky.30 There is also no direct evidence for the shape of the high unseen heavens, although it is likely that these levels too were thought to be circles. A cryptic reference to the possible circular shape of the Heaven of Anu may be found in a su.ila where the Heaven of Anu is identified with a nignakku 'censer' (Ebeling Handerhebung 14:16). Censers were flat, round objects.
The Bonds of Heaven
A number of texts refer to cosmic bonds, including 'bonds' (riksu, markasu), 'lead-ropes' ($erretu), and the durmal;u ('great bond'), which secure the heavens in place. The most complete explanation of how the heavens are secured is found in Ee V 59-62 (see p. 119). Here Marduk twists Tiamat's tail into the durmal;u, and uses this durmal;u to keep the heavens in place over the earth's surface and Apsu. Then, Mardukuses Tiamat's crotch as a wedge to hoist the heavens upwards and keep the heavens from falling. Later in Ee V 65-68, Marduk secures the riksu 'bonds' of heaven and earth and fastens $erretu 'leadropes', which he hands to Ea in the Apsu. These lead-ropes may be tethered to higher regions of the Universe, and Ea, the lord of the bottom region in Enuma Elish, may hold these lead-ropes to keep the higher regions from floating away.31 Although it is not certain how the apparatus described in Ee V looked when it was fully operational, it is likely that it had the appearance of a lattice of rope work, with the durmal;u as its central axis. This durmal;u may have been a thick reed bundle, since a "reed" durmal;u is listed in Urra VIII:
gi.dur.mab su-I;u (durmal;u) gi.dur.mab = gir-ri-gu-u gi.dur.gal = MIN MSL 719:186-88
Both the gi.dur.mab and gi.dur.gal, according to their etymologies at least,
should be large objects made of reeds.32

31 Note also the parallel in A George, Iraq 48 134 B 8-9 (see p. 120). For further examples of markasu, see CAD Mil 2834, and perhaps also Kinnier Wilson Etana 66: 10
(cf. 64 I1G 2). For $erretu, see CAD $ 135 ab, W. G. Lambert, Kraus AV 196:2, SAA 3 121

Another example of Marduk lifting heaven upward may be found in Ludlul Bel Nemeqi. CAD N/2 89 2' understands the parallel lines Ludlul Bel Nemeqi I 9,11: (dmarduk) sa nagbi
qatesu la inasstl sama~il (BWL 343 II D. J, Wiseman, AnSt 30 102) as explaining that Marduk's hands hold up the heavens: "from the depth, do his (Marduk's) hands not hold up the heavens?" However, a more likely translation of the line "(Marduk) whose full hands the heavens cannot bear" is suggested by a bilingual parallel (see BWL 314 n. 9). 32 For the bonds of heaven and earth, see also George BTT 261-62; CAD S/2 381: seams (sibuu) of heaven and earth.



266 The Geography of the Heavens
The Gates of Heaven
The Moon, Sun, stars, gods, and others pass through gates33 when entering and leaving the heavens. Gates occur in both Sumerian and Akkadian texts and lead into both visible and nonvisible levels of heaven.
Gates to the High Heavens
Gates to the high heavens are found in Adapa, Nergal and Ereskigal, and Etana. In Adapa, Adapa travels along the /:Jarran same 'Path of Heaven' to the Gate of Anu, where he finds the gods Tammuz and Giszidda guarding the gate (see p. 65). In Nergal and EreSkigal, the simmelat samami 'Stairway of Heaven' leads to the Heaven of Anu by way of the Gate of Anu, Enlil, and Ea (see p. 66). In Etana, Etana and the eagle enter the Heaven of Anu by passing through the Gate of Anu, EnUI, and Ea, and the Gate of Sin, Samas, Adad, and !Star (see pp.50-51).
Gates to the Visible Heavens
In numerous Akkadian and Sumerian texts, the Moon, Sun, Venus, and the stars are said to pass through heavenly gates. As these astronomical bodies rise or appear in the sky, they are said to enter the heavens through gates. Conversely, as they set or disappear, they leave the heavens through gates. For instance, in an ikribu-prayer to Sin, the Moon-god opens the door of heaven when he appears in the sky (S. Langdon, RA 12 190:3); Adad thunders by the gate of the Moon in SM 8 119:5; the opening of the abulli sa same rapsilti 'gate of the vast heavens' allows stars and constellations to take their places in the night sky in a Prayer to the Gods of the Night (OECT 6 74: 10-75: 17), and Venus is said to open the bolt of heaven in a bilingual hymn (Cohen ErSemma 132:21). A gate of !Star also occurs in a broken context in an astronomical diary (Sachs-Hunger Diaries 1 106 -373 rev. 17'). In Enki and the World Order, the weather-god !Skur, rather than the Sun, Moon, or Venus, is charged with opening the bolt of heaven (Benito Enki 102:313; see p. 143). Thus, clouds, winds, and other atmospheric phenomena can also enter the sky through gates. The gates to the visible heavens are probably to be located at the eastern and western ends of the sky, where the Sun rose and set. In Old Akkadian cylinder seals, the Sun-god is depicted as rising through a gate by mountains that may be identified with the mountains east of Mesopotamia (see RlA 7 531 "Masu"). In Ee V 9-10, the gates and bolts of heaven are placed on the right and left sides of heaven.

F. Rochberg-Halton, JNES 42 214; CAD S/1 344, S/2 410; and n. 34 below. For recent
studies of gates and gate-parts, see J. Scurlock, Or 57 421-33; E. Leichty, JCS 39 190-96.
The CTGtes of Heaven 267
Parts of the Gates of Heaven
A number of passages refer to parts of the heavenly gates. Examples include the "Door of Anu" in The Exaltation of Istar (see pp. 144-45), a SinIddinam cone where Utu opens the gissi.gar.an.na 'bolt of heaven' (RIM 4 167:3), and a passage in Bit Rimki where the sun lifts the key-peg of the bolt in heaven's gate: S4
gissi.gar an.ku.ga.ta giskak nl.kak.ti te.ga.da.zu.de ina si-gar same e ellilUmes sik-kat nam-za-q{ ina su-li-i-ka
4R 17:5-6 + duplicates
(see CAD NII 256 namzaqu bil. section)
When you lift the peg of the key from the bolt of the clear heavens.
Approaches to the Gates of Heaven
There are three ways to reach the gates of heaven in Akkadian literature. First, it is possible to fly to the gates from the earth's surface, like Etana and the eagle. Second, it is possible to take a road, like Adapa. Third it is possible to climb a stairway like the simmelat samami 'Stairway of Heaven' in Nergal and Ereskigal. The Sun may use a similar stairway in an Old Babylonian prayer where Shamash opens the dalat same 'doors of heaven' and ascends a lapislazuli stairway (Starr Baru 30:9//RA 38 87:10-11; see p. 66). Another reference to a ramp or stairway of some sort may be found in a Nabonidus inscription that calls the wall of Babylon Imgur-Enlil a melit samami 'Incline of Heaven' and simmelat ganzer 'Stairway of the Underworld' (F. Al-Rawi, Iraq 47 4:15). Although it is never explicity stated how the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets reach the gates of heaven in other texts, it is logical to assume that the astronomical paths continued below the horizon. This may be confirmed by AO 6478, where a full circuit of the Path of Enlil includes travel below the horizon.
34 Note also the namzaqu 'key' of Anu in UVB 1536:12. For additional examples of the gates of heaven and parts of the gates, see n. 33 above; Sjoberg Moongod 167:20; E.

Chapter 12
Names for Earth
Numerous Sumerian and Akkadian names for earth and the regions of earth (the earth's surface, Apsu, and underworld) are known. Most names for earth are also names for the earth's surface and the underworld. For instance, erl?etu, the most common Akkadian name for earth, is also the common Akkadian name for the underworld, and the three earths of KAR 307 30-38 (earth's surface, Apsu, and underworld) are identified as erl?etu elitu, erl?etu qablitu, and erl?etu saplitu 'upper, middle, and lower earths'. Nonetheless, with the exception of the term erl?etu qablitu 'middle earth' in KAR 307 35, no name for earth is also used as a name for Apsu. Names of the Apsu are examined on pp. 30617, while names for earth, the earth's surface, and the underworld are examined below. Additional geographic terms and names for the sea are examined on pp. 295-306.

Both bilib/halib and ganzer are names for the entrance to the underworld, as well as the underworld as a whole. The entry pani er~etim 'front of the underworld' is a literal translation of the diri-compound IGI.KUR, since IGI is equivalent to panu and kur is equivalent to er~etu, while ganzer = bab er~eti indicates that ganzer is a name for a gate to the underworld. In CRT 167, a gate to the underworld is called ka.gal ganzer 'ganzer-gate', and Inanna enters the underworld at e.gal ganzer 'The Palace ganzer' in lnanna's Descent (see Sladek ID 59-60).

272 Names for Earth
ki, kur, ersetu
The most common names for earth are Sumerian ki and kur and Akkadian en}etu. The name er$etu is the most common Akkadian name for earth, the earth's surface, and the underworld, but Sumerian kur and ki only have some of these meanings. Sumerian ki is the most common name for earth and the earth's surface but is almost never used as a name for the underworld. In contrast, kur, the most common name for the underworld in Sumerian texts, is never used as a name for the earth's surface, although Sumerian kur.kur 'the lands' is a common name for this region. The three names also occur in compound names with ki, kur, or er$etu as the first element. Examples include the underworld name 'Earth of No Return' (kur.nu.gi = er$et la tari), and ki.gal = kigallu 'Great Earth'.
ki. Sumerian ki occurs countless times in the cosmic pair an.ki 'heaven and earth' and in parallelisms between heaven and earth in texts such as Gilgames and the Jjuluppu-Tree, Enki and Ninmab, and KAR 4, where an and ki are separated from one another in early times (see pp. 134-42). As such, ki also. occurs as a name for the exposed upper surface of earth, the earth's surface. Two examples of ki = er$etu as the underworld occur in bilingual texts. In SBH 139 no. iv 157-58, 600 Anunnaki are placed in ki = er$etu (see p. 18). These 600 can be identified as the 600 Anunnaki of the underworld in KAR 30737. In Utukku Lemnutu XVI, demons are sent down to ki = er$etu from the earth's surface:6
udug.hul a.la.bul ki.se ba.ba.ell.de
u-tuk-ku lem-nu a-lu-u lem-nu ana er$etimtim li-ri-du
CT 16 22: 280-281 + duplicates (cf. 0. Gurney, AAA 22 86: 136-137)
Let the evil utukku-demon and evil alit-demon go down to the underworld.
kur. The ordinary name for the underworld in Sumerian texts is kur. In addition to the meaning 'underworld', kur is also equivalent to Akkadian sadit 'mountain' and matu 'land'. The sign KUR was originally a pictograph of a mountain, so the use of kur as a name for the underworld may indicate that the underworld was once conceived to be a mountain, thought to lie in the mountains outside the Mesopotamian plain, or was placed inside a cosmic mountain that the earth's surface rested upon. Unfortunately, the origins of kur as a name for the underworld are not explained in surviving materials.7
6 Also note M. Geller, AfO 35 17:48.
7 It has long been argued that a cosmic mountain or weltburg exists in Sumerian
cosmology on the basis of Labar and Asnan 1: bur.sag.an.ki.bi.da 'mountain of heaven
and earth' (see TCS 3 51 n. 2).
Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 273
Numerous examples of kur as a name for the underworld occur in texts concerned with the underworld. For example, the term occurs more than 60 times in lnanna's Descent, over 30 times in Gilgames and the Jjuluppu-Tree, and more than 10 times in The Death of Ur-Nammu. Two other examples occur in the list of mes in Inanna and Enki, where Inanna steals mes, including kur.ell.de 'descending to the underworld' and kur.ell.da 'ascending from the underworld' (Inanna und Enki 28:23, 54:19-20). In ID 4-13 Inanna is said to abandon her temples before descending to kur. Later in ID 284-85, the goddess ascends from kur. Additional examples occur in a wide variety of texts, including the zi.pa-formulas in PBS I12 112 (see p. 271) and a hymn to Nergal:
garza.gi16.sa rnll.da.ri kur.se rsu.du7.du71 dnerigal lugal u4.su x x X x den.lil dnin.lil.bi sag.e.eS mu.ni.ri[g7] BL 196:26-28 (collated AOAT 11 15)
Enlil and Ninlil gave Nergal, the king who daily. .. , the (duty of) perfecting the eternal rite and everlasting deed for the underworld, as a gift.
er~etu. Akkadian er$etu is the most common Akkadian name for both the earth and underworld and is paired with Sumerian kur 'underworld' and ki 'earth', as well as common Sumerian names for the underworld, including arali, ganzer, kur.nu.gi, and urugal in lexical and bilingual texts. Like Sumerian kur and ki, er$etu has a number of other meanings, including 'land, sterritory, ground, and soil' (see CAD E 308). The term is a cognate of the most common names for earth in other Semitic langUages such as Hebrew (y1N, J ere$)
and Arabic (~~i, an;'). Unambiguous examples of er$etu as a name for the underworld occur in a wide variety of texts. In Gilg. XII, the Akkadian parallel to GilgameS and the Jjuluppu-Tree, Akkadian er$etu translates Sumerian kur 'underworld' more than 30 times (see Shaffer Sumerian Sources). Other examples of er$etu as the underworld occur in dream omens (Oppenheim Dreams 327:71-328:85); An Underworld Vision of an Akkadian Crown Prince (SAA 3 68-76); epithets of underworld gods such as Nergal, EreSkigal, Namtar, Bidu, and Enmesarra (see CAD E 311 2b); and a funerary text, where offerings are presented to the underworld gods in er$etu:
qi-sa-a-ti a-na mal-ki da-nun-na-ki it ilanimes a-si-bu-ut er$etimtim [uj-qa-a-is
K. 7856:19-22 (TuL p. 58)
I presented offerings to the malku-gods, the Anunnaki, and the resident gods of the underworld.
Unambiguous examples of er$etu as a name for the earth's surface are more difficult to identify, but three can be found in The Shamash Hymn, Atra-basis, and a prayer to Shamash and Adad. In Shamash Hymn 176-79, the Sun-god

shines over the earth (er$etu) and vast earth (er$etu rapastu) during the day (BWL 136). In the prayer to Shamash and Adad, Adad brings rain down on the kippat er$eti 'circle of the earth':
... dadad qu-ra-du ina kip-pat er$etiti u-sa-az-na-an-(nu) nu-ulJHu! BBR II no. 100:16 (CAD Z 43 zananu A 2)
... heroic Adad who brings down bounty on the "circle of the earth" ...
Here kippat er$eti is the earth's surface, since rain falls from heaven directly onto the surface of the earth. In a broken passage in Atra-basis, the flood-hero explains that he must build his boat because he can no longer live on the er$et denlil 'Earth of Enlil' (Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 90:48). In the parallel passage in Gilg. XI 41-42, Utnapistim explains that he can no longer remain on qaqqar denlil 'The Ground of Enlil', and so must descend to the Apsu. The only portion of earth above the Apsu is the earth's surface.
er~etu elitu, qablitu, saplitu 'Upper, Middle, Lower Earth'. The terms er$etu elitu, qablitu, saplitu occur in KAR 307 35-38 as names for the three earths. The Upper Earth is the earth's surface where Marduk settles the spirits of mankind; the Middle Earth is the Apsu of Ea; and the Lower Earth is the underworld, where 600 Anunnaki are imprisoned (see pp. 16-19). The term er$etu qablitu 'Middle Earth' also occurs a number of times in the Late Babylonian flood tablet BE 39099 (Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 11621) as a name for the earth's surface, rather than the Apsu:
[ .. ] x taq-bi-ma (da-nu u) dadad i$-$ur e-le-nu [dsin u dnerga]l i$-$ur er$etutli qab-li-tu4 [si-ga-ru n]a-ab-ba-lu tam-tu [a-na-ku a$]-$ur qa-du lab*-me-ia
Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 118:16-19
[ .. ] . You (Enlil) commanded and (Anu and) Adad guarded above, [Sin and Nerga]l guarded the Middle Earth, [The Bolt, "N]et of the Sea", [I (Ea) gu]arded together with my labmu.
Here, 'Middle Earth' is placed between Anu's region above and a region of Ea below. The earth's surface lies between Anu's heavens and Ea's region, the Apsu, where labmu are often to be found (see p. 308).
ki.gal = kigallu 'Great Earth'
Sumerian ki.gal and Akkadian kigallu have a number of meanings. In addition to 'underworld', ki.gal can be the base or pedestal of a statue, and the diri-compound KLGAL can be read sur7 with the meaning berutu 'foundation
Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 275
pit' (see CAD B 213). Akkadian kigallu also has the meaning 'base or pedestal of a statue' and 'raised platform for cultic use' (see CAD K 348).8 As a name for the underworld, ki.gal occurs in the name of Ereskigal, the Queen of the Underworld, as explained in PBS I12 112:62: zi dereS.ki.gal nin
sa ki. ga l.l a. k [e4 be] 'Be exorcised by Ereskigal, who is queen in the underworld'. Elsewhere, b.gal occurs in epithets of underworld deities (see TCS 3 54 n. 16), and Inanna turns her mind toward b.gal from heaven before descending to the underworld in Inanna's Descent: 9
an.gal.ta ki.gaUe gestu.ga.ni na.an.gu [b] dingir an.gaLta ki.gaUe gestu.ga.ni na.an. [gu b] dinanna an.gal.[ta ki.gaUe] gestu.ga.ni na.an.[gub] Sladek ID 103:1-3
She se[t] her mind from great heaven to great earth. The goddess [set] her mind from great heaven to great earth. Inanna [set] her mind from great heaven [to great earth.]
A phonetic variant ki.gul is attested in the epithet of Ningiszida lugal. ki.gu.la 'Lord of the Underworld' in TCL 15 25 rev. 10' and in an incantation to Utu (B. Alster, ASJ 13 46:55). This name can be compared with the term tus.gu.la 'great abode' that occurs as a variant of tus.kur.ra 'abode of the underworld' in GHT 164 (Shaffer Sumerian Sources 69). Akkadian kigallu is used as a name for the earth as a whole as well as the underworld. In literary contexts, kigallu occurs in parallelisms with the poetic names of heaven asru (w. G. Lambert, JAOS 88 131 rev. 6; OIP 40 103 no. 1:13) and ermi danim (OIP 2 149 v 4; Borger Esarh. -'75:3). In the surviving Akkadian portion of a bilingual work, kigallu is paired with tdmatu 'seas' (W G. Lambert, JCS 21 129:28). Elsewhere, kigallu is clearly a name for the underworld. In Late Babylonian royal inscriptions, foundations are placed on kigallu or irat kigalli 'surface of the underworld' (see CAD K 349 3). The underworld god Enmesarra is called $amt kippat kigalli 'Holder of the Circle of the Underworld' in R. Borger, ZA 61 77:48, and kigallu may be explained as the region of the dead in a Late Babylonian fragment:
· .. ] rkiLgal ilanimes i-N[E ...
] k · II t' tim v / • [t ? t'?
· . . t-ga - a : er$e Im sa mt- u. - z. ...
SpTU I 164:3'-4'
· .. 1the ... of the gods he . [ ... · .. ] kigallu (means) "earth of the d[ead"? ...
8 For kLgal in an Old Akkadian inscription with a possible meaning 'burial mound', see A. Westenholz, AfO 23 27-3l.
9 Compare CT 16 10 iv 25-30 II SpTU III 64 iv 17-26 (Utukku Lemnutu 10; see p.280).



276 Names for Earth
There are no surviving examples of the equation ki.gal = kigallu, but ki.gal corresponds to erl?etu in poetic names for the date-palm. Urra III 276 lists gisi bila.ki.gal 'Heir of the Underworld' (MSL V 116) as an equivalent of gisimmaru 'date-palm'. Both Malku II 129 (ZA 43 239+dupl.) and Explicit Malku III (CT 182 i 57+dupl.) equate gisimmaru with apil erl?etim 'Heir of the Underworld'. Thus ki.gal in ibila.ki.gal corresponds to erl?etim in apil erl?etim.
ki.ur.ra, kiUru
The Akkadian synonym list LTBA 2 2i 2-5 lists Akkadian kiUru, danninu, lammu, and irkallu as synonyms of erl?etu. A near Sumerian homonym ki.ur.ra is explained as nereb erl?etim 'entrance of the underworld' in Antagal G 22 (MSL 17221), and this same name also occurs in Akkadian in a su.ila to Nabu paralleling the name for the sky burilmil:
ga-mir sip-ti u purusse(es.bar) bu-ru-me ki-ur-ra
sa da-num den-La de-a se-mu-u zi-kir-su
W. Mayer, Or 59 461:9-lO
(Nabu) who controls the incantation and decision of sky and earth, whose command Anu, Enlil, and Ea obey.
Thus, kiUru may be a loanword from Sumerian. The other possibility is that both the Sumerian and Akkadian names are derived from Urartian qewra, since this word corresponds to erl?etu and qaqqaru in Urartian-Akkadian bilingual texts (see CAD K 476 kiUru B; AfO Beiheft 8/144 no. 23). Any relationship between the cosmic place name and the homonym meaning "metal cauldron" (see CAD K 476) is unclear.
ki.deres.ki.gal = asar dereskigal 'The Place of EreSkigaL'
See p. 289.
Sumerian kur.nu.gi4 /gi, kur.n u.gi4/gi.a, kur.n u.gi4.gi4 /gi.gi
Akkadian kurnugu, erl?et la tari 'Earth of No Return'
The compound name of the underworld 'Earth of No Return' is well attested in lexical lists and Akkadian texts but rare in Sumerian and bilingual works. The significance of the name is that human beings and most gods who descended to the underworld were never able to return to their former homes, as explained in ID 83-84:
a.na.am ba.du.un kur.nu.gi4.se
ba.ra.an lti..du.be nu.gi4.gi4.de sa.zu a.gim tti.m.mu.un
Sladek ID 113 83-84
Why have you (Inanna) come to the Earth of No Return? What brought you to take the road whose traveler never returns?
Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 277
In Akkadian times, the name was construed as the underworld name k u r = erl?etu plus a negative infinitive. In the Sumerian forms kur.nu.gi4.gi4 and kur.nu.gi.gi, the stem is reduplicated as with nu.gi 4.gi 4.de in ID 84.
Sumerian and Bilingual Examples. Both short Sumerian writings kur.nu.gi and kur.nu.gi4, as well as long writings kur.nu.gi4/gi.a and
kur.nu.gi4.gi4 /gi.gi are known. Proto-Izi and Proto-Izi Bilingual preserve
kur.nu.gi4 (MSL 1330:389; 37:22'), while Group Vocabulary CT 51 168 iv 69 preserves kur.nu.gi. The long writing kur.nu.gi4.a occurs in an excerpt from Lti. = sa (MSL 12 lO6:65) and Lanu C iii 2' (see CAD K 564). The writing kur.nu.gi.gi occurs in PBS I12 11264 and kur.nu.gi4.gi4 occurs in a bilingual Sagigamd incantation:
dnam.tar udug.gal urugal.la kur.r nu 1.gi4.gi4.ke4
dM1N u-tuk-ku rabflu sa qab-ri e[r-I?]e-ti la ta-ri
STT 173:1-2 + duplicates (J. Prosecky, ArOr 47 50)
Namtar, great utukku-demonof the grave (and) 'Earth of No Return'
Another writing, kur.nu.gi.da, occurs in an oath formula in LKA 77:
zi den.uru. ul.la dnin.uru.ul.la [kur ].nu.gi.da.ke4 be.pa
: nis den.uru.ul.la : dnin.uru.ul.la : sa kur-nu-gi
LKA 77 i 5-7 (E. Ebeling, ArOr 21 361)
Be exorcised by Enurulla and Ninurulla of 'The Earth of No Return'.
In the oath, kur.nu.gi.da is in the genitive case, so da following the base gi must represent the ending ede plus the a of the genitive ak. Other Sumerian examples of the term occur in ID 83 (see p. 276) and an Enuru incantation found on an amulet:
lUkin.gi4·a
dumu.nam.tar.me. [d] ka.gal kur.nu.g[i.(a)] im.ta.e.me.e [s]
The messenger, the son of the fates, came forth from the gate of "The Earth of No Re[turn".]
RA 64 68:5-8
Akkadian Examples. Akkadian scribes rendered 'Earth of No Return' both by a loanword kurnugu and an Akkadian translation erl?et la tari. In lexical lists, the loanword occurs in Lanu C iii 2' (see CAD K 564), Igituh (short version) (AfO 1882:157), and Ea II 122 (MSL 14252), while kur.nu.gi4.a and kur.nu.gi are translated as erl?et la tari in Lti. (MSL 12 106:65) and Proto-Izi Bilingual (MSL 13 3722'). Outside lexical lists, the term is almost always written KUR.NU,CI4,A, but it is not clear if this writing represents the Akkadian translation erl?et la tari, the



278 Names for Earth
loanword kurnugu, or a loanword 'kurnugia'. Both Igituh (Short Version b 157), where kur.nu.gi4.a is translated as su 'itself', and the opening line of The Descent of IStarindicate that KURNU.CI4.A was not always meant to be translated:
a-na KURNU.CI4.A qaq-qa-ri l[a ta-ri]
CT 1545:1
An Akkadian rendering of the line ana er$et la tari qaqqari la tari seems awkward, so KURNU.CI4 .A here almost certainly represents one of the loanwords. If so, qaqqari la tari in the second half of the line was probably meant to explain the Sumerian loanword, just as lullu-amelu 'human being' in Gilg. I iv 6 and Ee VI 7 consists of lullu, a loanword from lu.ulu1u, plus the Akkadian equivalent amelu. lO In a medical incantation KURNU.CI4.A is contrasted with er$etuY

kur.gi. Sumerian kur.gi = er$etum occurs immediately before kur.nu. gi 'Earth of No Return' in Group Vocabulary CT 51 168 iv 68-69 and should be the opposite of this underworld name. It is possible, though, that kur.gi is a phonetic writing for kur.gi6 'dark earth', since numerous passages explain that the
underworld is a dark region (see pp. 352-53). Another possibility is that kur.gi is a scribal error for kur.nu.gi, which was taken up in the scribal tradition.
Vast Earth er~etu rapastu, kLdagal, kur.dagal. The term er$etu rapastu is a common Akkadian name for the underworld but also occurs a few times as a name for the earth's surface. Sumerian equivalents of the term, ki.dagal, ki.nl.dagal, and kur.dagal, occur in bilingual texts. Examples of er$etu rapastu as a name for the underworld include passages in Nergal and Ereskigal, incantations, and royal inscriptions. In the Amarna version of Nergal and Ereskigal, Ereskigal offers Nergal kingship in the Vast Earth as a wedding gift:
at-ta lu mu-ti-ma a-na-ku lu as-sa-at-ka lu-se-e$-bi-it-ka sar-ru-ta i-na er-$e-e-ti ra-pa-as~ti lu-us-ku-un tu-up-pa sa ne-me-e-qi a-na qa-ti-ka at-ta lu be-e-lu

Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 279
You will be my husband, I will be your wife.
r will have you receive kingship in the Vast Earth. I will place the tablet of wisdom in your hand. You will rule.
In the late Uruk version of the text, Ereskigal instructs her vizier Namtar to sit on her underworld throne in the Vast Earth prior to a planned visit to the Heaven of Anu:
e-li-ma ti-Sab ina giskussi parakki(bara) sarru-u-tu di-ni er-$e-tu4 ra-pa-as-tu4 i-pu-us at-ta
SpTU I 1 iii 7'-8'
Go up and sit on the throne of the dais of kingship. You render the judgements of the Vast Earth.
Elsewhere, the underworld gatekeeper bears the epithet idugal er$etu rapastu 'chief gatekeeper of the Vast Earth' (Farber Btar und Dumuzi 174 n. 146), and an incantation to Shamash speaks of the vast earth in conjunction with the gates of the underworld:
te-pe-et-ti abul(ka.gal) er$etiti rapastiti
tu-nam-mar nu-ra ana da-nun-na-ki tu-gaml-mar l di-nam
KAR 32:30-31
You open the gate of the vast earth. You make light shine for the Anunnaki, you settle the court case.
In Late Babylonian inscriptions, foundations are placed at irat er$eti rapasti 'surface of the vast earth', just as they are placed at irat er$eti and irat kigalli 'surface of the underworld' in similar contexts (see CAD I 186-87 irtu 1 c). In other passages, 'vast earth' refers to the earth's surface. In Ee VII 6869, Marduk as Enbilulu-lJegal is said to rain down abundance on the 'vast earth', and dew settles on the vast earth in LKA 70 ii 25:
... kima na-al-si er-$e-tim rra-paL[aHim li-iz-nun] ... like dew of the va[st] earth [may you rain down].
Shamash Hymn 176-79 list duties of the Sun-god over the earth's surface, including those concerned with the 'vast earth', and humans on the 'vast earth' gaze at the sun in a bilingual parallel: 12

280 Names for Earth
In Utukku Lemnutu IV, kLdagal = er$etu rapastu is reached by way of the "Gate of Sunset" and is associated with Nergal:

This passage parallels ID 1-3, where Inanna turns her mind from an. gal 'the great heavens' toward the underworld (ki.gal) before traveling to the underworld gates (see p. 275). EnkilEa's departure toward the underworld here in Utukku Lemnutu can be compared with GHT 14-16, where Enki sails to the underworld k u r. In another bilingual passage, 'The Vast Earth' (kur.dagal = er$etu rapastu) is the underworld abode of an asakkku-demon (CT 173:22).
'Great Earth' kur.gal = ersetu rabitu
The Akkadian term er$etu rabitu occurs as a name for the underworld twice in the Sultantepe version of Nergal and Ereskigal (STT 28 v 10', vi 6; see AnSt 10 122, 124), and twice in An Address of Marduk to the Demons (w. G. Lambert, AfO 19 117:26,32; see pp. 356-57). In the second text, a new arrival to the underworld must pass the gate and stream of the Great Earth. Another example of the gates of er$etu rabitu may be found in the apodosis of an astronomical omen:
... ] x e KURGAL aar-gal-lu-sa it-tab-ba-ku
ACh Adad 19:3613
... ] .. the locks of the great earth will be overturned.
13 ACh Adad 17:34 preserves a similar apodosis: dadad sa KUR: sa AAB.BA l:Jar-gal-li-sa HE.HE.
\
Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 281
The feminine pronoun sa indicates that KURGAL should be grammatically feminine, like er$etu rabitu, rather than masculine as in sadu rabu 'great mountain'. A parallel, where the doors of the underworld hold their locks in place, is found in Bit Meseri II:
dbi-dUg atu rabu sa er$etimtim pa-nu-us-su li-iz-ziz
ugisdaltu aur-gul-li-su li-i$-bat
G. Meier, AfO 14 146:127-28
Let Bidu, the chief door-keeper of the underworld, stand before him, and let the door hold its locks fast.
Sumerian examples of kur.gal as a name for the underworld include the epithet of Nergal en.kur.gal (A. Sjoberg, ZA 63 4:39, RIM 4 345 no. ILl); an Ur III literary text where Nergal "fills" kur.gal (see A. Sjoberg, ZA 63 10 no. 39), and a Surpu-incantation where Girra provides a light in kur.gal:
EN dgirra se.er.gal kur.gaLta [il].la kir5 kukku.ga zalagnu.[x.x] ug.an.na.ke4 an.na re l(UD.[DU).an.na]

'Earth of the Dead' kur.ug5.na = erseti mitilti
The term 'Earth of the Dead' occurs in an obscure passage in a Dumuzi text as the destination of Dumuzi: 14
in.di in.di gaba kur.ra. [se]
il-lak i-Uk a-na i-rat er-$e-tim [u4].zal.e u4.zal.e kur.ug5·na.se

4R 30 no. 2 22-25
He goes, he went to the surface of the underworld. All day long, all day long, to the 'Earth of the Dead'. (Akk.: It remained present: the Sun set for him toward the 'Earth of the Dead'.)
14 For this text and passage, see Jacobsen Treasures of Darkness 66, 247 n. 47; Unity and Diversity 86 n. 22. Sumerian kur.un.na can also mean sadu eLU 'high moun
tain' and sadu elutu 'high mountains', as is probably to be restored in Nabnitu 25:148-49 (MSL 16 227). Compare also SpTU I 164:3'-4' (see p. 275).



282 Names for Earth
'Distant Earth' kur.su.da/ersetu ruqtu
The Akkadian portion of a later passage in 4R2 30 no. 2 preserves another compound name for the underworld, 'Distant Earth':
mes ki.a.na.su nu.mu.un.da.pa.da15
et-lu ana er$etimtim ru-uq-ti sa la in-nam-ma-ru
4R 30 no. 2 34-35
(Dumuzi) the youth to the distant earth, which is never seen
A parallel to Akkadian er$etu ruqtu may be found in the first line of a hymn to NingiSzida:
[ur].sag en sa.tum a.gara rurl.mab kur.s[u.da] TCL 1525:1
[He]ro, Lord of Meadow and Field, Lion of the Dista[nt] Earth.
ammatu (ambatulabbatu)
The term ammatu, a poetic name for earth, occurs in Enuma Elish, The Babylonian Theodicy, and Malku. In Ee I 1-2, samamu and ammatu 'heaven
and earth' do not exist at the very start of creation.16 The Theodicy preserves an adverbial form of the term, ammatis, which is explained by the commentary as kima er$eti 'like earth' (BWL 74:58). In Malku I 51, ammatu (ambatu) is listed as a synonym for the name of earth, dannatu (A. Kilmer, JAOS 83 425).17 Akkadian ammatu is probably a cognate of Hebrew i'1i:)1N eadamil) 'ground'.
arali, arallu
The underworld name arali = arallu is common in Akkadian and bilingual texts but relatively rare in Sumerian works. Four Sumerian writings of the term are known. Most common are the syllabic writing a.ra.li and the diricompound E.KUR.BAD, which is glossed a.ra.li in Igituh (Short Version) 158 (AfO 1882). Less common are the writings KUR.BAD (araliJ, which is glossed a.raJi in Group Vocabulary CT 51 168 iv 66, and URUxX, which is known from parallel entries in Ea and Aa:
a.raJ [i] = URUx[X] = er-wtum
Ea IV C' 12' II Aa VII4 29 (MSL 14432,441)
15 Compare RIM 4 284: 3:kLan.a.na.su.a.as/ki.an.na.a.kLSu.a.as.
16 In RA 79 187-88, M. Hutter,argues that ammatu is a name for the underworld
in Ee I 1-2. For Ee I 1-2, see also p. l08.
17 The writing am-ba-tum is only attested in STT 392:51 (Malku I 51), so this may
be a scribal error for am-rna-tum. For the commentary to Theodicy 58, see also CAD A/2
75 ammatu B "lexical section."
Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 283
In Akkadian texts, both a short writing arali and a long writing arallu are known. For example, Nabnitu 25 72-73 preserves a-ra-al-l[u-u] (MSL 16 226), while Aa VII4 30 preserves a-ra-li (MSL 124441), probably for aralu. The origins of arali as a name for the underworld are unclear, but it seems probable that the term became a name for the underworld because of
close connections between a.ra.Ii, Dumuzi, and Dumuzi's city Bad-Tibira.18 A temple named e.a.ra.li belonging to Dumuzi is located in or near Bad-Tibira in TCS 3 30:215, and Dumuzi is captured by gallu-demons in a "ditch of arali" (e.a.ra.li) before being carried away to the underworld in Dumuzi's Dream:
e.a.ra.li.ka be.en.sub ki.ni ba.ra.zu ddumu.zi.de e.a.ra.li.ka mu.nUn.dab 5·be.ne
B. Alster, Dumuzi's Dream 70:150-51
"He fell into the ditch of arali. I do not know where he is." They (the gallu-demons) seized Dumuzi in the ditch of arali.
In this passage, e.a.ra.li 'ditch of arali' may be pun on the temple name e.a.ra.li or even allude to a ditch that an underworld stream flows through. In two other Dumuzi texts, a.ra.li is located in steppe-lands that presumably lie outside Bad-Tibira:
edin nigin edin nigin ses.mu edin.nigin edin a.ra.li edin.nigin seS.mu edin.nigin Cohen Ershemma 88:28-29 (CT 15 19)
(Gestinanna) roams the steppe, roams the steppe, "my brother" (Dumuzi, she cries) as she roams the steppe. The steppe, arali, she roams the steppe, "my brother" (she cries as) she roams the steppe.

In any case, arali is already in use as a name for the underworld in the Ur IIIperiod literary work The Death of Ur-Nammu:

18 In JAOS 103 195 g, T. Jacobsen suggests that arali was originally the name of the
desert between Bad-Tibira and Uruk and that the use of arali as a name for the underworld is secondary.

A bilingual parallel where Ninanna replaces Ninazimua is found in Utukku
Lemnutu III: du b.sar.mab.arali = tup-sar-ra-tum fjir-tum sa a-ra-al-le-e (CT 163:95-97). Another Sumerian example of arali as a name for the underworld occurs in a late Enuru amulet:
16. ba.ug7 ki.n6. nu.tuku 16. ba.ug7 sag.Em.tar nu.tuku
a.ra.li kUus.a ba.tus
The man who is dead has no bed. The man who is dead has no attendant. In arali he sits on a seat.
RA 6468:2-4
In a bilingual incantation to the Sun-god, dead gods inhabit arali = arallfl:
sag.tuku dingir.ug5.ga.am sa.ga arali.ke4
ra-bi-ifj dingir-u&-ga-e i-na qe-reb a-ra-al-li
A. Falkenstein, UVB 1536:9
(Sun-god) caretaker of the dead-gods inside the underworld.
In Akkadian texts, arallfl is both a name for the underworld and a mountain where gold is found. 19 Examples of arallfl as the underworld include Underworld Vision 28, 30, 53, and 58 (SAA 3 70-74) and an incantation where the name occurs alongside the synonym "Earth of No Return":
a-na KURNU.CI4.A li-Se-re-es-su-nu-ti a-na etemmi(gidim) a-ra-le-e
li-ru-su-nu-ti
LKA 154 rev. 12-13
Let it (fire) take them down to the "Earth of No Return", let it direct them to the ghost of the underworld.
In Gilg. IX ii 4-5 and the account of the eighth campaign of Sargon II (TCL 3 6:19), the bases of cosmic mountains Mt. Masu and Mt. Simirriya reach into arallfl below, while the peaks of the mountains reach the heavens above. In Erra I 151-53, the roots of a cosmic mesu-tree reach down to arallfl (see p. 245).
KURBAD
In Group Vocabulary CT 51 168 iv 66, the diri-compound KURBAD is glossed a.ra.li, indicating that the two signs fan be read aralix' Elsewhere,
19 For arallil as a mountain of gold, see Urra 22:22 (MSL 11 23), Lipsur Litanies (E. Reiner, JNES 15 132:21) and the inscriptions of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal (Borger
Esarh. 88 rev. 14; E. F. Weidner, AfO 13 205:26). The name of the mountain, however, derives from the land of gold harali = l:Jarallil known from third millennium and Old Baby
lonian tablets (see A. Sjoberg, JCS 40 174), so the shared name between the mountain and the underworld is probably coincidental. A second Mt. Arallu is identified with the cella of the god Assur, Ehursagkurkurra, in the city of Assur (Winckler Sargon 70:416-17; 128:156).
Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 285
however, KURBAD is resumed by m in an exorcism formula, suggesting that KURBAD could also represent a different name: KURBAD.ma : [sa . ..J (ArOr 21 373:46). One possibility is a reading kur.idim, since idim is equated with erfjetu 'underworld' and ekletu, etfltu 'darkness' in Emar 568 52'-54'. Another possibility is a diri-compound KURBAD = dalam on the basis of a lexical tablet related to the series Malku. 20
KURBAD = da-la-mu KURBAD = he-pEi es-su KURBAD = he-pEi es-su CT 18 29 ii 26-28
If dalamu does represent a loanword from Sumerian dalam, which is a name for the underworld, then lines 27-28 may have preserved common names for the underworld, such as erfjetu and arallfl. The cosmic place name KURBAD also occurs in the divine name den.KUR BAD (PBS I12 106:17).
bur, buru, l:Jastu
Sumerian bur/buru 'pit, hole' occurs as a poetic name for the underworld. In Aa II/4 110 (MSL 14 283), buru is equated with erfjetu. The same name occurs in a hymn to Lugalgirra and Meslamtaea:
en dlugal.gir.ra glri.zu um.mi.gub n un.kur.ra.ke4 sa.mu.e.si.gam.e.de.eS bur.ra u4.zalag sa.mu.un.ne.ri.ib.e
A. Sj0berg, Or. Suec. 19-20 142:23'-25'
Lord Lugalgirra, when you set foot there, the prince(s) of the underworld indeed bowed down to you. In "The Pit" you made a shining light go out for them.
In line 25, bur.ra may be a syllabic spelling for buru = erfjetu plus locative a. Akkadian hastu 'hole, grave, pit' is explained as erfjetum in the commentary to Theodicy 62 (BWL 74): "For the crime which the lion committed the hastu 'hole' (i.e., erfjetum 'underworld') is opened for him."
a.ni
Sumerian a.ni is equated with erfjetu in Group Vocabulary CT 51 168 iv 65. This is surprising, since none of the usual meanings of a.ni (see MSL 14 206:194-210) explain how a.d. can be a cosmic place name.
v 20 K. 2054+ (CT 1829-30) may be an exemplar of an expanded versi9n of Malku = Sarru. The colophon identifies that tablet as the third tablet of the series Sarru (CT 18
30 rev. ii 32), and the opening line preserves the entry [mal]-ku = sarru, followed by 30
more equivalences of sarru. Canonical Malku only lists five equivalences (A. Kilmer, JAOS 83 424:1-5).



286 Names for Earth
dannatu and danninu
Both dannatu and danninu derive from the root dananu 'to be strong'. In KAR 307, the surfaces of each of the three earths, including the underworld, are identified as dannatu (see p. 16). In Malku I 51 (JAOS 83 425), dannatu is listed
as a synonym of the name of earth ammatu, while the lexical tablet LTBA 2 2 i 2 and commentaries to Enuma Elish equate danninu with er$etu (see CAD D 91; Fest. Finkelstein 14). The term danninu occurs both as a name for the underworld and for the earth as a whole. In Diri II and Proto-Diri III, danninu is equated with the Sumerian underworld names bilib and ganzer (see pp. 269-70), and a hymn to Nergal identifies the 600 Anunnaki of the underworld with danninu:
a-si-ir dan-ni-na sa-ni-iq ni-i-ir lu-us-tar-ri-iJ; nar-bi-ka
Bollenrucher Nergal 50:4
(Nergal) controller of the underworld, organizer of the 600, let me extol your might.
In Ee VII 135-36, the term is paired with the name for heaven asru:
as-su as-ri ib-na-a ip-ti-qa dan-ni-na dbel matati sum-su it-ta-bi a-bu den-lil
Ee VII 135-36
Because he created the heavens, fashioned the earth "Lord of the Lands" is the name that father Enlil gave him.
In Assurbanipal's Acrostic Hymn to Marduk and Zarpanitum, danninu occurs with Apsu and lumasu-stars (SM 3 8:37).
erigal-See urugal
esgalla
The name esgalla is a a loanword from Sumerian es.gal 'great shrine'. In Ee IV 143-46, esgalla is a second name for the Apsu (see p. U3). However, it is possible that esgalla was also a name for the underworld, since the signs used to write es.gal (AB.GAL), when joined ABxGAL, form a writing for the underworld name urugal = er$etu (Ea IV 162a, Aa IV/3 107; MSL 14361,381).
esmahhu
Akkadian esmaJ;J;u occurs twice as a cosmic place name. In the Marduk hymn STC I 205 19-21 (see pp. 310-11), esmaJ;J;u is the underworld that houses the dead $allutu (literally 'the sleepers'). Here, esmaJ;J;u is a poetic name for the underworld alongside poetic names for the other three regions of the universe: heaven, the earth's surface, and the Apsu (samamu, dadmu, asurrakku). The second example of esmaJ;J;u is found in a Sennacherib inscription in the first of
Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 287
two epithets of "The Tablet of Destinies": [p]iristi samamu u eSm[aJ;J;i] '[S]ecret of Heaven and esm[aJ;J;i]', and [m]arkas ermi anu u ganzer '[B]ond of Anu's Canopy (Heaven) and Underworld' (A. George, Iraq 48 133 B 4-5; see p.227). Here esmaJ;J;u parallels ganzer.
ganzer, kanisurra
Sumerian ganzer is both a name for the underworld and an entrance to the underworld. In Diri II and Proto-Diri III (see pp. 269-70), ganzer, written IGLKURZA, is both explained as bab er$eti 'gate of the underworld' and also translated by the underworld names er$etu, danninu, irkalla, and kukku, as well as by loanwords ganzer and kanisurra. In Antagal D 123, Sumerian ganzer is equated with Akkadian irkallu (MSL 17205). The etymology of ganzer is uncertain (see A. George, Iraq 48 136 n. 5). In addition to the diri-compound IGLKUR.ZA, the name is also written IGLKUR in Group Vocabulary K. 4177+ with a gloss [ga].an.zer (see CAD I 177).21 In Diri and Proto-Diri, the diri-compound IGLKUR is treated as a separate name for the underworld, to be read bilib or baUb. The clearest textual examples of ganzer as a name for the underworld are found in GHT 176, 180, and 233, when Gilgames's pukku and mekku fall into ganzer. The corresponding lines of Gilg. XII translate ganzer by the underworld name er$etu (see Shaffer Sumerian Sources 71-72,83). Earlier in GHT 167, however, ganzer occurs in the name of a gate to the underworld:
ka.gal ganzer IGI.KUR.ra.ka tus im.ma.ni.in.gar
In this line, IGLKUR is probably to be understood as pani er$eti 'front of the underworld', as in Diri II 145 and Proto-Diri III aa, with the subsequent translation:
At the ganzer-gate at the front of the underworld they (the pukku and mekku) came to a rest.
Nevertheless, a reading ganzer for IGI.KUR is possible here, since the signs are resumed by r. The first part of GHT 167 is repeated verbatim in a variant of ID 126 (see Sladek ID 118 n. 126). Examples of ganzer in names for the entrance of the underworld include passages in Inanna's Descent, where giSig.kur.ra 'door of the underworld' and ka.gal.kur.ra 'gate of the underworld' are located at e.gal.ganzer 'the palace ganzer' (see Sladek ID 59-60); Inanna und Enki 60:41, which preserves e.ga. an.ze.er 'the house ganzer'; and the divine epithet lUsi.gar ganzer'door-man of ganzer' in PBS II2 112:69.
The only known Akkadian examples of ganzer outside lexical lists occur in a Sennacherib inscription, where ganzer parallels ermi danim (A. George, Iraq 48 133 B 5), and a Nabopolassar inscription, where simmelat ganzer 'Stairway

hastu-See bur, buru, hastu, p. 285
hilib, halib
Diri and Proto-Diri preserve parallel sections explaining l:Jilib and l:Jalib (IGLKUR), and ganzer (IGLKUR.ZA; see pp. 269-70). No certain examples of the names outside Diri and Proto-Diri are known, since IGLKUR is never resumed by a syllable beginning with b. Possible examples of the term, however, may be found in Group Vocabulary CT 51 168 iv 67, where IGI.KUR is translated as en}etu, GHT 167, where IGI.KUR occurs with ganzer (see p. 287), and a passage in Utukku Lemnutu XII:22
ki.tus.a.na ki.IGLKUR.am su-bat-su a-sar er-$e-tim-ma

A related entry may be found in Group Vocabulary K. 4177+:
x[u.kuIGLKUR = dir-[kal-la] (see CAD I 177 irkalla)
irkalla
Akkadian irkalla, a literary name for the underworld, occurs both with and without determinative dingir and in the compounds subatdirkalla, musab dirkalla, and bn irkalla. The name may be an Akkadian rendering of the Sumerian underworld name urugallerigal, but no lexical or bilingual equivalence between the Sumerian and Akkadian names is known. In lexical lists, irkalla is equated with Sumerian hilib/halib, ganzer, kir5, and lamhu (see CAD I
177). Outside lexical lists, irkalla occurs in literary works and the late mysticalreligious commentary 0175:7 (Livingstone 190). In Descent of !Star 4, Gilg. VII iv 33, and Nergal and Erdkigal (STT 28 ii 1', v 8', vi 47), as well as 01 li5:7, the term is written with the determinative dingir. Examples without the determinative include Erra I 135 and IV 123; Ludlul II 47 (BWL 40); and LKA 62 rev. 11, 13-14 (the variant edition of The Descent of IStar) ..

Names for 'Earth', the Earth's Surface, and the Underworld 289
Within the texts listed above, irkalla occurs in compound forms four times. In parallel passages from The Descent of IStar and Gilg. VII, the underworld is called "House of Darkness" and subat dirkalla:
a-na bit e-te-e su-bat dir-[kal-la]
a-na bit ek-le-ti su-bat dir-kal-la
CT 1545:4
Gilg. VII iv 33
To the "House of Darkness" the abode of the underworld,
o 175:7 also preserves this same compound with the writing TUS dir-kal-la. A variant to Gilg. VII iv 33 preserves musab irkalla and LKA 62 rev. 14 preserves bn irkalla.
The use of the determinative before the underworld name may indicate that irkalla in the compounds, at least, should be understood as a divine name as well as a place name. In an Old Babylonian god-list, dirkalla is identified as a name of the goddess Allatum, who is equated with Ereskigal:
deres-ki-gal-la [dal]-la-t[um]. dal-la-tum = da[l-l]a-t[um] dir-kal-la = dal-la-t[um]
E. Weidner, AfK 2 73:23-25 (cf. Ugaritica V 218:116-18)
On this basis, the parallel lines in The Descent of IStar and Gilgamesh could be
translated 'to the House of Darkness, the abode of (the goddess) Irkalla'. If so, this name may be compared with the underworld name 'Place of Ereskigal' (ki.deres.ki.gal = asar dereskigal), which occurs once in Dumuzi and Gestinanna 6 (Sladek ID 226:6) and once in a bilingual incantation in UtukkuLemnutu VI (0. Gurney, AAA 22 86: 130-31).

k u k k u, kukku, KLKI
Sumerian kukku 'darkness' occurs as a name for the underworld in Diri IV 236-37:

CT 11 48 rev. iii 4' (CAD K 498)



290 Names for Earth
In Proto-Diri IIId, Akkadian kukku is equated with ganzer and synonymous with danninu and kanisurra (see pp. 270-71). Although the name is written KI.KI in Diri IV, the term most probably originated from a writing of the word kukku (KUlO.KUlO = MI.MI) that is equivalent to Akkadian ekletu and etUtu
'darkness' (see CAD E 413). Sumerian KI.KI, with the reading utu, may also be listed as a name for the underworld in Antagal G 19:
KLu.tUKI = erfjetimtim s[a ... MSL 17221
The term 'House of Darkness' (e.kukku = bit ekleti) occurs in Surpu 53 rev. 12-13, a Sumerian incantation (see YOS 11 p. 20e) and parallel descriptions of the underworld in The Descent of IStar, Gilg. VII, and Nergal and Ereskigal (see p. 349).
lam, lamma, lammu
Sumerian lam and lamma, and the loanword lammu, are listed as equivalents of erfjetu in lexical lists and commentaries. In LTBA 2 2 i 2-5, lammu is listed as a synonym of erfjetu along with danninu, kiilru, and irkalla, while Sumerian lam is equated with erl?etu in Group Vocabulary CT 51 168 iv 63, and lamma is equated with erl?etu in Sb1 216:
la.am.ma = LAM = er-I?e-tum MSL 3115:216 corrected by MSL 4 206:216
Outside lexical lists, lam is equated with erl?etu in explanations of the
word melammu in commentaries: 23

matu saplitu 'Lower Land'
Diri IV equates matu saplitu with the underworld name kukku = kukku 'darkness' (see p. 289). The term matu saplitu usually refers to southern areas downstream from central Mesopotamia, or down the Persian Gulf.

naqbaru
Akkadian naqbaru 'tomb, burial place' appears as an equivalent of arali in a Group Vocabulary CT 1830 rev. i 30 and Antagal D 124 (see p. 271). The name naqbaru can be compared both with Sumerian urugallerigal, which has the meaning qabru 'grave' as well as 'underworld' (see p. 293), and Akkadian hastu 'pit, grave' (see p. 285).
qabru-See urugal = qabru, pp. 293-94
qaqqaru
Akkadian qaqqaru, like Sumerian ki, is commonly used as a name for earth and the earth's surface but also occurs as a name for the underworld. The word occurs from the Old Akkadian period onward and is the most common
name for earth in Achaemenid royal inscriptions (see CAD Q 1232').24 An Old Assyrian example occurs in an incantation (BIN 4 126:13). Old Babylonian examples occur in three parallel lines in a hymn to !Star (VAS 10 213 i 6', 8', 10') and a broken passage in an Old Babylonian religious text:
[ ......... ] ruLsu-li-ia-su ka-qa-ar-su
(w. G. Lambert, Fest. Reiner 192:43 (cf. 192:32)
[ ......... ] he raised him up to earth.
In this passage, qaqqaru must be the earth's surface, since there is no cosmic region below the underworld or earth (the lower half of the universe as a whole). Other examples where qaqqaru refers only to the earth's surface include Gilg. VII iii 44, where the princes of the qaqqaru are said to kiss Enkidu's feet; Gilg. XI:41,
24 Parpola (LAS II 117 n. 6, 21) proposes that Neo-Assyrian KLTIM, when paired
with samu, be read as forms of qaqqaru (kaqqaru, qaqqiru, etc.) rather than er$etimtim. See also K. Deller, Fest. von Soden 48 u.

Two other texts, The Cruciform Monument of Manistusu (E. SolIberger, JEOL 2055:78-80) and an Amarna letter (EA 105:11), contrast qaqqaru with names for the sea, so qaqqaru can also refer specifically to the dry land portion of the earth's surface. Examples of qaqqaru as a name for the underworld include the terms qaqqaru la tari 'Earth of No Return' and qaqqiru rabftu 'Great Earth' in variant versions of The Descent of IStar (CT 1545:1; LKA 62 rev. 10, 12) and a passage in fire incantations (W G.

saplatu 'Lower Regions'
The name saplatu, a general term referring to lower parts ot the universe, often appears as an opposite of elatu 'Upper Regions' (see CAD SI1 464 2). On a few occasions, saplatu refers specifically to the underworld. In funerary texts, both saplatu and elatu occur in a common blessing: 27
i-na e-la-ti sum-su li-id-mi-iq i-na sa-ap-la-ti e-f;e-em-mu-su me-e za-ku-ti li-il-tu-u
VAS 1 54:15-19
In the upper regions let his name be praised. In the lower regions let his ghost drink pure water.
In a broken passage in a funerary text, the Anunnaki gods are found in saplatu:

urugal, erigal
The Sumerian underworld name urugallerigal, literally 'Great City', occurs in the name of the king of the underworld Nergal. The Emesal god list explains that the most common writing of the god's name, dne.erin.gal (= dnerigal1), is a contracted form of en.urugal 'Lord of the Great City': 28
dumun.rurugall = dne.erill.gal = su Emesal 1106 (MSL 4 9)
In Emesal 1:2, 12-14, 43, and 50 (MSL 4 4-7), names of gods beginning urn u n in Emesal start with en in the standard dialect. Hymns to Nergal and epithets of Nergal also use the name urugaI. In PBS I12 112 iii 61, Nergal is called "Enlil of urugal". This epithet is explained in a hymn to Nergal:

Nergal, at the eternal hOUSe?, "The Great City;' you are the junior Enlil.
In Death of Ur-Nammu 89 (S. Kramer, JCS 21 114), Nergal is identified as den.lil.kur.ra 'Enlil of the Underworld'. Sumerian urugallerigal also occurs in epithets of other underworld gods in Death of Ur-Nammu 109, 133 (JCS 21 114-15) and in RIM 4 284:3. In lexical lists and bilingual works, urugal is translated by Akkadian names for the underworld. Nabnitu XXV 74 equates urugal with arallu (MSL 16226), and urugal = eri$etu occurs in Proto-Izi 387 (MSL 1330) and the bilingual menology of Astrolabe B (KAV 218 A iii 3, 8). Broken examples of urugal = eri$etu are also found in Ea and Aa (MSL 14 361:162a, 381:107, 441:32). As noted earlier, Akkadian irkalla is probably a loanword from urugallerigal.
urugal = qabru
As well as a name for the underworld, urugal also has the more common
meaning qabru 'grave' (see CAD Q 17-18).' Both meanings are clearly related, since the destination of all those lowered into graves was the underworld. An example of urugal = qabru as the underworld may occur in the opening line of a bilingual totengeist-incantation where "captive gods" are found in urugal = qabru:

The 'captive gods' are placed at the gates of the underworld in Bit Meseri II 126-28 (AfO 14 146) and may be associated with the underworld gate bab kamuti 'Gate of the Captives' (AfO 19 117:25; TuL 1288').29
zikura
A rare, possibly foreign name for 'earth', zikura (KASKAL.AS) is listed in Antagal G 282 (MSL 17 228) as an equivalent of er:jetu.
House Names
A number of Akkadian names for the underworld are kennings formed by compounds with bitu 'house'. These include 'House of Darkness' (bit eti, bit ekleti), 'House of Death' (bit milti) , 'House of Dumuzi' (bit ddumuzi) , and 'House of Dust' (bit epri). A related equation e.ki.kur = er:jetu is found in K. 2873:1-2 (CT 1741).30

Ekurlbit ekur. AHw 196 identifies the name of Enlil's temple at Nippur, Ekur, as a name for the underworld on the basis of passages in Ludlul Bel Nemeqi and bilingual incantations. In these texts, Ekur is the haunt of demons, but there is no proof that Ekur is a name for an underworld beneath the earth's surface. In Ludlul, an utukku-demon leaves Ekur when a number of diseasedemons leave their homes for Babylon in order to infect Subsi-MeSre-Sakkan:

Later, in Ludlul III, the utukku-demon leaves the body of Subsi-Mesre-Sakkan and returns to Ekur:

[He sent d]own Apsu-ward the evil cough. The relentless utukku-demon he returned [to] Ekur.
BWL 52:6-7
In Ludlul, it is unlikely that Ekur is an underworld beneath the earth's surface, since the utukku-demon neither ascends nor descends between Ekur and Babylon. In contrast, the 'evil cough' descends from Babylon to the Apsu in BWL 52:6. Examples of Ekur in bilingual incantations also fail to identify Ekur as an underworld beneath the earth's surface. In these incantations the cosmic Ekur is identified with Enlil's temple Ekur in Nippur. In the opening lines of a Sagigames incantation, headache leaves Ekur (CT17 25:1-4). Here Ekur is identified as the "House of Enlil." In Utukku-Lemnutu III (CT 16 1:23-27), disease-demons leaving e.a e.kur = bit ekur 'the Temple Ekur' are identified as messengers of Enlil. In a second Sagigames incantation (J. Prosecky, ArOr 47 51:37-38) demons leave es e.kur = bit ekurfor the land (kalam = matu). In all three incantations, as in Ludlul II 54, forms of the verb e = a:ju 'to leave' describe the movement of the demons from Ekur to the earth's surface, rather than ell = elu 'to go up', as might be expected if Ekur was an underworld beneath the earth's surface.31
Geographic Terms
In addition to names for earth such as ki, er:jetu, and qaqqaru, a number of geographic terms refer to vast expanses of the earth's surface and perhaps even

'The Land' kalam, kur, ma.da, matu
Akkadian miltu, like the English word 'land', has a wide range of meanings. Among these are 'dry land' (as opposed to seas), 'flat plain', 'country' in a political sense, and 'homeland'. In its broadest sense, miltu can refer to all dry land areas on the earth's surface. For example, the worldwide empire of Sargon is said to occupy milt sil;ip same 'the land under heaven' in Sargon Geography 31, and Etana reports that he sees matu 'land' and tamtu 'sea' when he gazes down at the earth's surface during his flight to the heavens (see pp. 60-65). No comparable unilingual Sumerian examples of kalam, kur, or ma.da are known. However, two bilingual texts may preserve passages where kalam refers to at least the continental portion of the earth's surface. In UtukkuLemnutu V, kalam.dagal.la = miltu rapastu 'vast land' parallels an.dagal.la = samu rapsutu 'vast heavens' (CT 16 13 iii 13-16). In a bilingual literary letter, kalam extends from sunrise to sunset:

32 For ma.da, kur, and kalam, see H. Limet, RA 72 1-12. The equivalence of a number of these geographic terms is demonstrated by the bilingual Akkadian-Aramaic Tell-Fekherye inscription, where Aramaic mt is translated by Akkadian dadmu, kibriltu,
and miltu (see J. Greenfield and A. Shaffer, Iraq 45 110).

'The Lands'kur.kur = matiltu
297
'The Lands' is used from the Early Dynastic period onward to refer to all the countries on the earth's surface. When combined, the territories of these countries comprised the entire earth's surface.
kur.kur 'The Lands'. The term kur.kur is the most common Sumerian name for large portions of the earth's surface. Examples where kur.kur includes most if not all of the lands include a Sumerian hymn in which Enki's gissu 'shade, protection' covers kur.kur from sunrise to sunset (CT 36 32: 5); a hymn to Inanna, where kur.kur reaches from above to below (Reisman Two Hymns 148:13-14); and Gudea Cyl. A 9:18-19, where kur.kur extends to an.za 'the horizon' (see p. 94). In the Vase Inscription of Lugalzagesi, kur.kur extends from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and from sunrise to sunset (BE I12 87 i 44-ii 16; see p. 321). No Sumerian examples of ma.da.ma.da used in cosmic contexts with reference to the entire earth's surface are known, although matatu is often written ma.da.ma.da in Late Babylonian royal inscriptions.33
miltatu 'The Lands', Akkadian matatu is the usual equivalent of Sumerian kur.kur (see CAD Mil 415). The term occurs regularly from the Old Babylonian period to the Hellenistic period. An earlier example may be found in The Cruciform Monument of Manistusu (the son of Sargon of Akkad), but this text is generally thought to be an Old Babylonian or later forgery (see E. Sollberger, JEOL 2050-51). The term matatu can include all the lands on the earth's surface. Often, rulers who claim universal kingship also claim to rule the miltatu. For instance, Sargon is said to rule the matiltu from sunrise to sunset in Sargon Geography 43. Parallels in royal inscriptions include a passage in which Tukulti-Ninurta I receives tribute of the matiltu from sunrise to sunset (Weidner TN 26:22-24) and a late parallel in the Antiochus-Soter inscription (VAB 3 134:17-18; A. Kuhrt and S. Sherwin White, JHS 111 76 ii 17-18). Examples in literature include the final two lines of The Erra Epic, where all the miltiltu and the people of the dadmu are implored to praise Erra (Erra V 60-61), and Shamash Hymn 20, 22, 40, where the Sun shines over miltatu (BWL 126-28). An adverbial form of the term, miltitan, meaning '(in) all countries' or 'everywhere' is also known (see CAD Mil 411-12). In Malku I 192 the term is equated with matatu.

The Four Regions:

The geographic term 'The Four Regions' is based on a tradition of dividing the earth's surface into northern, southern, eastern, and western quadran~s derived from the four winds or compass point directions. Ancient MesopotamIans could determine the four directions by correlating the position of the sun, moon and stars with wind direction and the time of year (see pp. 195-200). The
close ~onnection between the four winds and earthbound geography is demonstrated by the names of the east and west winds. The east wind, IMkur.ra = sadu bears the name of the mountains east of Mesopotamia, and the west wind 1Mmar.du = amurru bears the name of the Amorites who first arrived in Sumer and Akkad from the west in the third millennium. The importance of the four winds in geography is also documented by Shamash Hymn 151-53, where the Sun reveals omens to the human race in the world (dadmu) in all four wind directions (BWL 134), and passages in The Tukulti-Ninurta Epic (Machinist TN Epic 66 I A1:3', 116 I A V:17), where the terms kippat sar erbeu,i 'c~rcle ~f the four winds' and kippat erbetti 'circle of the winds' refer to Tukulh-Nmurtas empire. A system of dividing the earth's surface and level of the winds into four quadrants may be diagrammed on BagM Beih. 2 no. 98 (see p. 194).~5 , Numerous Sumerian and Akkadian versions of the geographlc term the four regions' are known. The most common are Sumerian ub.da.limmu.ba and an.u b.da.limm u.ba 'the four corners', and Akkadian kibrat arbaJi, kibrat erbetti 'the four regions' and kibratu 'the regions'. The term is first attested in both Sumerian and Akkadian during the reign of Naram-Sin in the royal epithet 'King of the Four Regions' (lugal.an.ub.limmu.ba = sar kibrat ~rbaJim!.36 Thus it is not possible to determine whether the Akkadian or Sumenan verSlOn is oldest. The Sumerian and Akkadian terms, although equated with one another in lexical lists and bilingual works, are not all exact translations of one another. Sumerian u b.da has the basic meaning tubqu 'corner/edge' while Akkadian kibratu appears to be a plural noun derived from kibru 'edge, shore'. Exact translations of Sumerian ub.da.llmmu.ba as tubuqat arbaJi and tubuqat erbetti are known, but rare. The tenn tubuqat er~etti occ~rs thre~ tim~s: in a Tukulti-Ninurta I inscription (Weidner TN 8:5), a Tlglath-PIleser I mscnp

tion (E. Weidner, AfO 18 349: 9), and in Izi, where both tubuqat erbetti and kibraterbetti are equated with u b.da.limm u5 (MSL 13212 i 9-10). The equiv:a
lent tubuqat arbaJi occurs in LTBA 2 1 iv 11-12, where both tubuqat arbaJi and kibratu are equated with mattltu. A third Akkadian version of the tenn, tu-buuq rer?-bieLti may occur in a bilingual work from Susa (MDP 57 36 i 30). There are numerous passages where Akkadian forms of the 'the four regions' encompass all the land areas on the earth's surface (see CAD K 33133). Perhaps the clearest example is World Map rev. 26'-27', where kibrat erbetti apparently refers to the entire earth's surface on the map. In Sumerian texts, no such unambiguous examples of 'the four regions' as the entire earth's surface can be found. Utu-Hegal and kings of the Ur III dynasty adopted the title 'King of The Four Regions',37 although these kings could not claim anything approaching the "worldwide" empire of Naram-Sin. In Sumerian literature, Duranki (Nippur) is placed in the center (murub4) of ub.da.limmu.ba in a hymn to Enlil (Reisman Two-Hymns 49:68), but the hymn does not provide the outer borders of 'the four regions'. . It is also not certain how the terms for 'the four regions' originated. There are two lexical difficulties. First, Sumerian u b.da 'corner/edge' and Akkadian kibratu 'edges, shores' should logically refer to the outer edges of the earth's surface rather than its interior. Second, the common Sumerian form of the term an.ub.da.limmu.ba, which begins with the name of heaven an, could be the name of a region of heaven like an.ur, an.pa, and an.za. Both problems can be solved. Mesopotamian terms often refer to the interior of regions when only borders are named. For example, in Neo-Assyrian inscriptions, kings are said to conquer lands adi pat gimrisa, literally 'up to the edge of its entirety' (i.e., to its full extent; see AHw 852). Although this phrase refers literally only to borders, it is clear that the kings conquered the interior of the lands as well. Similarly, Sargon Geography 33-40 lists the talbitu 'circumference' of lands included in Sargon's Empire rather than measuring their interiors in units comparable to modern "square miles" (see p. 86). Thus ub.da. 11 m m u. b a and kibratu include territories up to the borders of the earth's surface at the horizon. This explanation of u b. d a and kibrtltu also helps explain an. u b. d a. limmu.ba. A number of passages explain that the far ends of the earth's surface and heaven meet at the horizon (see pp. 330-31). Hence, the corners and sides of heaven are also those of the earth's surface. Thus a term beginning with an can also to refer to the ends of the earth, as do the Sumerian names for the horizon an.ur and an.za. This explanation of an.ub.da.limmu.ba is confirmed by the equivalent term u h.da.an.ki 'corner of heaven and earth', which occurs in two Sumerian hymns (A. Sj0berg, OrSuec 19-20 145:13; A. Falkenstein, ZA 49 118:21).

300 Names for Earth
dadmu
The term dadmu, when used in cosmic contexts, seems to be synonymous with terms for 'the lands' and 'the four regions'. On other occasions, however, dadmu refers to cities or smaller settlements. On a cosmic scale, dadmu can be equal to the entire earth's surface. Sumerian gukin (LAGABxKIN) is equated with both kissatu 'the entire world' and dadmu in Ea I 120-21 (MSL 14a 14 183), and kur.kur is translated as dadmu, rather than matatu, in a hymn to Inannallstar: 38
ul.be.se mU.mu kur.kur.ra za.sa4 mu.bi ar.re.mu
sa ina su-pu-uk same e nap-l;a-tu4 ina da-ad-me zi-kir-su su-pu-u MIN (tanadatua)
SBH no. 53 rev. 48-49 (Cohen Ersemma 132:24)
My praise (is for) the one who shines on the firmament, her name is exalted in the lands/dadmu.
Other cosmic examples of dadmu include the opening line of The Erra Epic, where both dadmu and kibratu occur in epithets of Erra [sa]r gimir dadme banil kib[rati] '[Ki]ng of the entire World, Builder of the World Reg[ions]' (cf. Erra V 60-61); an Esarhaddon inscription where kullat dadme seems to be equivalent to kal kibrati (R. Borger, AfO 18 113:10-11); and a parallel in a hymn to Nabu:
a-a-u re1-pis kul-lat (da}-ad-me lu-tas-qar kali(d u)-si-na sa
kib-ra- ra1-[ti]
dan-n[u] rkis-sa-ti1 qi-bit-ka $i-rat dnabil at-ta-[ma]
LKA 16:6-7
Let me praise the one who made all the world, all of the regions, the mighty one of the universe, 0 Nabu, your command is exalted.
In a Sennacherib inscription, dadmu occurs alongside the names of heaven and underworld ermi danim and kigallu (orp 2 149 v 3-4).
Although dadmu is a near synonym of kibratu, mattltu, and kissatu, dadmu need not always include the entire earth's surface. In the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar, dadmu extends only from the shores of the Upper Sea to the shores of the Lower Sea but not across the sea to the nagil (VAB 4 146:18-22) Here, dadmu seems to correspond to the central continent on the World Map (see p. 31). However, in Shamash Hymn 182-83 (BWL 136), dalat dadme 'door of the world' parallels sikkur same 'bolt of heaven', indicating that dadmu can extend to the ends of the earth's surface where the Sun passes through the gates of heaven. 39
38 For additional examples of kur.kur = dadmu, see CAD D 18 and note also BA 5646:7-8. For sargadu = kissatu, gukin = dadmu, see also MSL 14400:99-100,417: 121-22. See also M. Civil, Or 56 237.

Names for the Sea 301
adnatu
The geographic term adnatu is a near synonym of dadmu. In Malku I 189-91, both are listed as synonyms of matu, and the two occur in nearly identical passages in The Shamash Hymn:
sa ad-[na]-a-ti dsamas uz-[ni]-si-na tus-pat-ti
BWL 134:149
Shamash, you open the minds of the (the people) of the regions.
kal si-l;i-ip da-ad-me u[z]-nHi-na tus-pat-ti
BWL 134:153
You open the minds (of. the people) until the limit of world.
In both passages, adnatu and dadmu refer to the human population of the earth's surface rather than just to the geographic features of earth. It is possible that adnatu, like dadmu in VAB 4146:18-22 (see above), only refers to the continent. In an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III, adnatu extends from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea: 40
ad-na-ti sa istu tam-tim eliti(an.ta) sa su-lum dsamsiSi adi tam-tim Sapliti(ki.ta) sa [d]U[TU.E ...
J. N. Postgate, Sumer 29 fig. 1:15 (following page 59)
The people/regions from the Upper Sea of sunset to the Lower Sea of [s]u[nrise ...
nabalu
The term nabalu, a noun from the root abalu B 'to dry out, to dry up' (see CAD A/I 29), is paired in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions with wmtu (see CAD Nil 20 b), so the term in its broadest sense refers to all dry land. An example of the term in literature occurs in a hymn to Gula: belet nabali sarur kullati 'mistress of dry land, glow of the universe' (K. 3371:20; see CAD Nil 21).

dian name for the sea (see AHw 1353), and the two occur together in Nabnitu IV nO-1l:
ab = tam-tum
a.ab.ba = MIN MSL 1681
Evidence from the third millennium suggests that a.ab.ba is a genitive construction meaning 'water(s) of the sea' (a of ab). Twice in Old Babylonian copies of inscriptions of Sargon of Akkad, the k of the genitive post-position ak appears: once due to the combination of the genitive and a locative, and once due to a double-genitive construction:
giStukul.ni a.ab.ba.ka l.lub AfO 20 35:51-53 (Gelb-Kienast 158)
(Sargon) washed his weapon in the sea.
za a.ab.ba.ka.se ma me.lub.baki ma ma.gan.naki ma dilmunki kar ag.ga.deki.ka bLkesda AfO 20 37 v 8-13 (Gelb-Kienast 164)
At the edge of the sea, (Sargon) tied the boat of Melubba, the boat of Magan, and the boat of Dilmun to the quay of Akkad.
Other examples of a.ab.ba with the genitive k occur in Ur-Nammu Clay Cone B i 14 and The Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk (CT 13 35:10, CT 13 37:31-32 + dupl.; see pp. 130-31). This might suggest that a b was the earlier form of the name a.ab.ba. The sea name ab may also occur in the Sumerian name for the Apsu abzu.42 Sumerian texts identify two seas by name: the Upper Sea = Mediterranean a.ab.ba igi.nim/.ma), and the Lower Sea = Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean (a.ab.ba igi.sig/.ga/.sig.sig). The earliest examples of these terms occur in The Vase Inscription of Lugalzagesi (BE 1/2 87 ii 3-9; see p. 321). Examples are also known from Old Akkadian royal inscriptions and Gudea texts (see RGTC 1 203-5).43
Other Sumerian Equivalences of tamtu. In addition to ab and a.ab.ba, Akkadian tamtu is also equated with nab in Aa II/6:22 (MSL 14291), and with sug and tul (see AHw 1353).
Akkadian Names
tamtu, tamatu, ti"'amat. The most common Akkadian name for the sea is tamtu, a name that also occurs in the uncontracted form tr:'amat/tr:'amtu, and
42 For possible etymologies of abzu = apsu, see p. 307.
43 Note also lists with a.ab.ba, a.ab.ab.si.ga, a.ab.ba.bu.lub.ba, a.ab.ba.sig. ga, and a.ab.ba.igi.nim.ma in Proto-Izi and Proto-Kagal (MSL 1328-29,76), and MSL 11 147 iii 11'-13': a.ab.ba, a.ab.ba.igi.nim.ma, a.ab.ba.igi.sig.
Names for the Sea 303
as tamatu/tawatu (see AHw 1353). The word derives from the root thm and is a cognate of Hebrew tehom. The name tamtu is used in all genres of texts, during all periods, and with reference both to the Persian GulflIndian Ocean and the Mediterranean. The Persian GulflIndian Ocean is usually called tamtu saplItu 'Lower Sea', and the Mediterranean tamtu elItu 'Upper Sea'. In Middle-Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian inscriptions, smaller bodies of water to the north of Assyria, including the seas of the lands of Nairi and Zamua (almost certainly Lake Van and Lake Urmia), are also called tamtu. 44 Thus Akkadian tamtu, like English 'sea', can refer to large lakes as well as the ocean.
ajabba. Akkadian ajabba is apparently a loanword from Sumerian a.ab.ba. In an Old Babylonian bilingual hymn, ajabba translates Sumerian a.ab.ba (see A. George, NABU 1991 p. 16 no. 19). Elsewhere, the term occurs both as a name for the Mediterranean in "The Foundation Inscription of YabdunLim" of Mari (G. Dossin, Syria 32 1-28; RIM 4 602-8) and Amarna texts and in the phrase ajabba tamtu rapastu 'ocean, vast sea' in Gilgamesh and incantations. In the Yabdun-Lim inscription, ajabba occurs three times. In one of these examples, tamtu and ajabba occur in phrases joined by ma, demonstrating that the two names refer to a single body of water:
a-na ki-sa-ad ti-a-am-tim il-li-ik-ma a-na a-a-ab-ba ni-qi sar-ru-ti-su ra-bi-a-am iq-qi
Syria 32 6 ii 8-11 (cf. ii 12, 22, RIM 4 606)
He went to the shore of the the sea and offered his great royal offerings to the ocean.
In the Amarna letters, ajabba is the standard name for the Mediterranean. Examples of ajabba at Amarna include EA 105: 11-13, where ajabba 'sea' parallels qaqqaru 'dry land' (see CAD A/I 221a). This name for the sea also occurs in the Amarna literary fragment EA 340:6 e (see P. Artzi, Eretz-Israel 24 232*).
In the prologue to The Gilgamesh Epic, ajabba tamatu rapastu refers to the cosmic ocean that Gilgamesh crosses later, in Tablet X, on his way to visit UtnapiStim:
[e-b]ir a-aJba1 [t]a-ma-ti rapastiti adi $It samsi(du tu.e)
Gilg. I 38 (Iraq 37 p. 162, pI. 37)

AOS 74 81 for an identification of Lake Zeribor as the (a?) Sea of Zamua. Although it may be assumed that the existence of the Black and Caspian Seas was known from at least the time of Tukulti-Ninurta I, no certain references to these seas are known. For possible references to the Black Sea, see ReTC 5 319 1,3203.



304 Names for Earth
In this context, ajabba and tamtu rapastu are also a single body of water. In incantations, the waters of the ajabba tamtu rapastu 'ocean, the vast sea' are apparently used as cleansing agents to wash off evil spells (see W. Farber, JNES 49 305-16). In one such medical incantation, the waters of the ajabba tamtu rapastu are sprinkled on a supplicant:
man-nam lu-us-pur a-na marat(mes) rdl [a-nim]
lil-qa-an-ni ka-ni-Si-na sa rna,l [bulali]
kar-pa-ti-Si-na sa na'uqn[i] (za.g [in])
li-sa-ba-ni memes a-ab-ba ta-ma-te rapa[stiti] me(a) ididiglat u idpurat[ti] li-is-Iu-ba li-bal-Ia-a sik-ka-tu mi-iq-tu a-[si-a]
BAM 543 30'-35' ONES 49 317)
Let me send someone for the Daughters of Anu. Let them take their jugs of [bulalu]-stone (and) their pitchers of lap [is] for me. Let them draw the waters of the ocean, the vast sea, (and) the water of the Tigris and Euphrat[es]. Let them sprinkle it and extinguish the sikkatu, miqtu, and a[su]-diseases.
It is not clear why ajabba is used together with tamtu rapastu. It is possible that tamtu rapastu was originally intended to explain the relatively rare word ajabba, although most copies of a parallel incantation preserve tamtu rapastu with the name of the Ulaja River instead of ajabba (JNES 49 314-15:6).45 Another example of ajabba alongside tamtu, albeit without the adjective rapastu, occurs in a prayer to Nabu (W. G. Lambert, RA 53135:44). The word also occurs in an epithet of Inanna/IStar:
[dinn] i [n].a.ab.baki = ia-bi-i-[tu] KAV 73:4' + KAV 145 rev. 3'
In Summa Alu, this same epithet is written AAB.BA-ta (CT 28 38 K. 4079a:11'). A male deity lugal.a.ab.ba is also known (Deimel Pantheon 163 no. 1854) and
dAAB.BA is equated with the west-semitic Sea-god Yamm at Ugarit.46
jamu. Akkadian jamu, a loanword from the common West-Semitic name for the sea, yamm, occurs in Uruanna as part of the plant-name kusajame (see
CAD IIJ 322; J Durand, MARl 757-60).
marratu. The name marratu is a first-millennium synonym of tamtu. The word derives from the root mararu 'to be bitter' and apparently refers to the fact that sea water is not potable. The name appears to be an Aramaic loanword into Akkadian, since it does not appear before the first millennium and Shalmaneser III identifies marratu as a Chaldean name for the Persian Gulf
45 For the Ulaja River in what may be a related context, se SM 6 288; ]. Scurlock, NABU 1993 pp. 11-12 no. 17.

Namesfor the Sea 305
(WO 1 387:3-6; see p. 26). On the World Map, the cosmic ocean is labeled marratu (see pp. 21-22). In Neo-Assyrian texts, marratu occurs regularly as a name for the Persian Gulf. Examples include the Shalmaneser III inscription, a passage in the inscriptions of Sargon II where Bit Yakin and Dilmun are located by the marratu (Winckler Sargon lOO:22), and a passage in the inscriptions of Sennacherib where the city of Kar-Nabu in Chaldea is located on the shore of the marratu (A. Grayson, AfO 20 88:8-9). In contrast, only two Neo-Assyrian examples of the term as a name for the Mediterranean are known. Twice in the inscriptions of Sargon II the Mediterranean is called the upper marratu while the Persian Gulf is identified as the lower marratu (R. C. Thompson, Iraq 7 87: 12; Winckler Sargon 176:23-24).47 Thus it is possible that the term was originally only a name for the Gulf, rather than a synonym of tamtu. However, on the World Map, which was composed in Babylonia during the Neo-Assyrian period (see pp. 25-26), the entire cosmic ocean is identified as the marratu. By the Late Babylonian and Achaemenid periods, marratu is used as a synonym of tamtu for both the Upper and Lower Seas. In a Neriglissar Chronicle, the city of Pitusu on the coast of Asia Minor is placed on the shore of the marratu (Grayson Chronicles 104:20; see RGTC 8 251), Egypt lies by the marratu in the inscriptions of Darius (VAB 3 11 no. 6:5), and Greeks live on the shore of the marratu and across the marratu in the inscriptions of Xerxes (Herzfeld API 30 no. 14:18-19). Late examples of marratu as a name for the Mediterranean occur in historical notices in astronomic diaries (see, for example, Sachs-Hunger Diaries II 496 C 14'; III 72 upper edge: Antioch which is on the idma-rat).
On the World Map, and in a number of other texts, marratu occurs with the id (river) determinative, demonstrating that the marratu was, in some sense, thought to be a river.48 A related term jarri marti 'pool of bile' occurs in apposition to tamtu gallatu 'restless sea' in a description of a defensive moat outside Babylon built by Nebuchadnezzar (VAB 4 134 vi 45-46).
Other Synonyms of tamtu
Malku II lists four more equivalents of tamtu 'sea' and one equivalent of tamatu'seas':
se-er-kup-pu mu-gam-mir-tu si-qi-tul mas-qi-tum

a-ba-ma-a-tum ta-ma-a-tu

48 Compare with Hesiod's Theogony 241-42, where Greek Oceanus bears the epithet "Perfect River."



306 Names for Earth
The synonyms of tamtu only occur in lists and commentaries. The equation serkuppu = tamtu is also attested in An VII: 11, and the same word (or a homonym) with the meaning apu 'reed-swamp' occurs with writings serkuppu, sarkuppu, zarkuppu later in Malku II 77 (see CAD S 177). Exactly how a reed-swamp could also be a sea is not clear unless ancient Mesopotamians considered coastal marshes, as well as the open sea, to be part of the ocean. The name mugammirtu = tamtu also occurs in the synonym list K. 4233+ ii 30 (CT 18 9) and in the late commentary LBAT 1577 rev. ii 2' (mu-gam-mirt[um = ... ]). This name is a II-stem feminine participle from gamaru (gummuru) with a probable meaning 'the encloser', since the sea, on the World Map at least, encloses the lands. The variants siqitulmasqitu, both from the root saqu 'to water, to give to drink' may be compared with the English slang name for the ocean "the drink." AHw 1353 compares abamatum with Nuzi ammu = team-teo
Names for Apsu
Four names for the cosmic Apsu 49 occur in lexical lists: a b z u = apsu, engur = engurru, anzanunzu,50 and asurrakku. The first two are the most common names for the cosmic Apsu. In lexical lists, abzu and engur are equated with apsu in Proto-Izi I (bilingual) i 10'-11' (MSL 1337), and Sumerian engur is equated both with a loanword engurru and apsu in Ea I 70, Aa I12 233-34, and Proto-Aa 40:1-2 (MSL 14 180,215,91). A parallel list in unilingual Proto-Izi
I 363-64 (MSL 1329) lists Sumerian engur, engur.mab, and abzu.51 Akkadian anzanunzu and asurrakku are not equated with abzu = apsu or engur = engurru in lexical lists but do appear in Malku II as synonyms of mu saplUum 'lowlying waters, deep waters' in a section of terms related to water and bodies of water:
an-za-na-an-zu-u a-sur-rak-ku
mu mes sap-lu-tum
MIN
a-ru-ru MIN
W von Soden, ZA 43 236:52-54 II SpTU III 11954-56
In Aa II/4, mu saplUu occurs as a near synonym of mu rilqiltu 'distant waters, deep waters':
49 For a previous study of abzu = apsu and synonyms, see Green Eridu 154-60. 50 The reading anzanunzu is preferred over dzanunzu because the term is never written without ANldingir as are other cosmic place names that are occasionally written with dingir. For cosmic place names written both with and without dingir in Diri and Proto-Diri, see pp. 269-70. 51 Note alsosug = apsu in Aa II2 208 (MSL 14214); ap.ar = apsum in MSL 3217 G5 6'; and broken entries in Aa II8 239 (MSL 14 241) and Sbl 142a (MSL 3 110). For
ABxA as a name for Apsu in UET 6 67 see Charpin Le Clerge 371 n. l. For a Greek transliteration alJft!a~1;O), see E. Knudsen, AOAT 240 138 rev. 6-7.

Thus anzanunzu and asurrakku are, in some sense, distant deep waters of the Apsu below the earth's surface. A list of synonyms for apsu also occurs in a list of temples and shrines in Malku I that begins with synonyms for esirtum 'sanctuary':

Malku I 288-91 (A. Kilmer, JAOS 83 429)
A badly damaged parallel list occurs in Explicit Malku (JAOS 83 444: 175-79) between terms for shrines and ziggIJrats. Here, only the equivalents e-engurra and due-ku can be restored. Three of the four names in Malku I 288-91 are names for temples or shrines. Eengurra is the name of Enki's temple in Eridu. Abzu is the name of Enki's shrine in Eengurra, as well as shrines dedicated to EnkilEa in Eridu, Ur, and Lagash (see Green Eridu 177-80).52 Shrines called du6.ku were also found
in Eridu, Nippur, Lagash, and, later, in Babylon.53 Akkadian duku also occurs as a cosmic place-name, but no connection between the cosmic duku and the Apsu is certain (see pp. 315-16). The name lalgar occurs as a cosmic place-name belonging to Ea, but there is no evidence for temples or shines named lalgar.54 Thus lalgar may appear Malku I 290 because it is a name for the cosmic Apsu. Two other equivalents of apsu, segbar and hal.an.ku, only occur as names for Apsu shrines.
abzu = apsu
Sumerian abzu and Akkadian apsu are names for Apsu temples and shrines, cultic water basins, and the god Apsu, as well as name for the cosmic Apsu. The origins of the word are uncertain. Akkadian apsu may be a loanword from Sumerian abzu, but it is also possible that abzu is borrowed from Akkadian, or that both abzu and apsu are borrowed from a third language. If the term is originally Sumerian, abzu may derive from the Sumerian name for the sea, abo If so, abzu may mean 'knowing sea' (ab.zu), since the Apsu belongs to

Enki, the Sumerian god of wisdom. A later interpretation of the word as 'distant sea' may be found in a hymn to Enlil:
me.bi me.abzu lu igi nu.bar.re.de sa.bi ab.su.da an.za nu.zu.a Reisman Two-Hymns 46:43-44
Its (Ekur's) mes are mes of the Apsu which no one can understand. Its interior is a distant sea which 'Heaven's Edge' cannot comprehend. 55
In Sumerian texts, engur occurs much more regularly as a name for the cosmic Apsu than abzu itself. Nonetheless, examples of abzu as a cosmic place name are found in The Curse of Agade and Lugalbanda. In The Curse of Agade, An and Enki remove possessions from Akkad to their cosmic homes in an.sa and Apsu prior to the destruction of the city (Cooper Curse of Agade 52:72-54:75; see p. 247). In Lugalbanda 221, a lahama comes out of 'abzu, just as 50 labama inhabit engur in Inanna und Enki 40:28, and lal:Jmu live in the apsu in Samas Hymn 38 (BWL 128).56 Sumerian abzu also occurs as a name for the cosmic waters of the water tablet beneath the earth's surface in Sumerian literature. Examples include passages in The Kesh Temple Hymn (where abzu occurs with an.sa), Enki's Journey 22, and an Dr-Nammu hymn:
e eb.gal an.ne us.sa e zi.da.gal an.ne us.sa e men.gal an.ne us.sa e dtir.an.na an.ne us.sa e mus.bi an.sa.ga la.a te.me.bi abzu.a si.ga TCS 3 169:31-36 (Kes Temple Hymn)

Similarly, in Late Babylonian royal inscriptions, walls and foundations of buildings are placed in apsu, and irat apsi 'the surface of Apsu' (see CAD A/2 196 b). Akkadian apsu is by far the· most common name for the cosmic Apsu in Akkadian texts. Examples of the term as a cosmic place name include Ee IV 137-46, where apsu/esgalla is the lowest of three cosmic regions, and Atra-hasIs I 17-18, where Ea descends to the Apsu in early times when Anu ascends to heaven (Lambert-Millard Atra-hasis 42).
engur = engurru
The most common Sumerian name for the cosmic Apsu is engur. Examples in Sumerian literature include EN 13-14, where Enki rests in the engur.buru 'deep Apsu' (see p. 138); Lugalbanda 78-79, where the Anzu-bird ascends to heaven and his wife descends to engur in search of their missing fledgling; Inanna und Enki 40:28, where 50 lal:Jama inhabit engur; and a passage in a hymn to Ninurta-Ningirsu, where a god grants Ninurta kingship in heaven, earth, and Apsu:
nam.lugal.zu an.rna1 mu.un.gal ki.a rmul.un.gal den.ki.da engur.ku.ga za.e sa.mu.un.ne.dab 5.en

of temples were fastened by foundation-pegs all the way into the Apsu. See also B. Alster, ASJ 9 32 line 5. For an early study of this and related aspects of Apsu see R. Burrows, Or. 1 231-56.



310 Names for Earth
The loanword engurru is only known from lexical entries in Ea, Aa, and Proto-Aa (see p. 306). In bilingual texts, engur is translated as apsu, rather than engurru (see CAD A/2 194-95). In CT 1645:136-37, e.engur occurs as a variant for engur = apsu.59
anzanunzu and asurrakku
Although neither anzanunzu nor asurrakku60 is ever eqvated with abzu = apsu or engur = engurru in lexical lists or bilingual texts, both are used as names for the Apsu or waters of the Apsu. In Malku II 52-53, both names occur as synonyms for mu mes saplztum 'deep waters' (see p. 306). In literature, both occur as cosmic place names for the Apsu together with names for other cosmic regions. In a literary letter that introduces an exemplar of The Weidner Chronicle, anzanunzu and asurakku occur together with 'heaven' in a blessing:
rik1?-ru-ba-an-(ni) ina a-sur-rak-ki-i ma-an-za-za

She (GuIa) blessed (me): In asurrakku you will establish an abode, in anzanunzu you will ...... . [Toward] the distant heavens you will lift your head ...
In Ludlul II 37-39, anzanunzu occurs with qereb same:

BWL 40:36-38
What man can explain the plan of (the gods in) the Apsu? Where has the human race ever learned the way of a god?
In the hymn to Marduk STC I 205, asurrakku occurs with names for heaven, the earth's surface, and the underworld:
ul-tu a-sur-rak-ka be-lum ilanimessu-ut da-ad-me i-na pa-an giSqasti(pan)-su ez-ze-ti im-me-du sa-ma-mi sa eSmal:JJ;i $al-lu-tum l:Ja-mu-u it gar-ru

60 Variant writings anzananzu and anzanuzu are also attested for Malku II 52 (see p. 306).
Names for Apsu
He is the lord of the gods of the inhabited world from asurrakku (upward). Before his furious bow the heavens stand still. The "sleepers" (dead) of the 'Great Shrine' (underworld) are stunned and panic-stricken.
311
In an earlier portion of this same text (STC I 205:9), Marduk 'roils' the Apsu, just as Marduk roils asurrakku in a bilingual parallel:
e.ne.em dasal.lu.bi a.sur.bi ab.lu.lu
a-mat dmarduk a-sur!-ra-ak-ku i-dal-la-aJ;
4R 26 no. 4:51-52
The word of Marduk roils asurrakku.
a-na u-ta-az-zu-mi-su id-dal-la-J;u ap-su-u
The Apsu is roiled by his (Marduk's) roaring.
In Descent of !Star 27, the goddess roils apsu.
STC I 205:9
Three other examples of the anzanunzu are known. In these examples, anzanunzu occurs in the context of subsurface waters, both identifying anzanunzu as a name for Apsu and justifying the equation anzanunzu = 'deep waters' in Malku II. In The Shamash Hymn, a mariner almost drowns in anzanunzu:
te-em-mi-id a-na al-la-ki sa sup-su-qat u-r[u-uJ;-su] a-na e-bir tamti(a.ab.ba) a-dir a-ge-e ta-nam-d[in x x]

In this context, anzanunzu is the depths of the sea, since Shamash saves the mariner from drowning in anzanunzu by raising him upward. In Shamash Hymn 35-38 and 171-73, apsu is the depths of the sea (see p. 340).61

The Apsu is also to be found in rivers in an incantation to the River of Creation (R. Caplice, Or. 39 135:24), the Akkadian incantation The 21 Poultices (w. G. Lambert, AnSt 30 80-82), and Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 78 iii 25-30 (for all of these, see pp. 338-39). In CT 46 55, asurrakku occurs as a cosmic place name alongside heaven and earth, but it is not certain that asurrakku is a name for the Apsu in this context (see pp. 178-79). Three additional examples of asurrakku occur in the inscriptions of Sennacherib, where the Tebiltu river in Nineveh has an asurrakku (OIP 2 96:76; 99:49; 118:15). This asurrakku appears to be an underground culvert that Sennacherib built to redirect the waters of the Tebiltu River away from the
planned building site of his new palace.62 The hidden culvert of the Tebiltu, like the cosmic Apsu, was filled with underground waters.
The Etymology of asurrakku and anzanunzu. The doubled consonant k at the end of the asurrakku indicates that asurrakku is a loanword from Sumerian. As written, the term would seem to be based on a genitive construction 'a (water) of sur'. A possible etymology based on such a construction might be 'a of sur6/7 (= me berutu) 'water of the foundation pit'.63 In a Nebuchadnezzar II inscription, the foundations of the IStar-Gate at Babylon are placed both at irat apsi 'the surface of Apsu', as in other Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions (see CAD A/2 196 b), and at me berutu:
... i-Si-is-sa mi-/;i-ra-at ap-si-i i-na su-pu-ul me-e be-e-ru-tim u-sa-ar-si-id
IR 52 no. 3 ii 18-19 (VAB 4 86 ii 18-19)
(The IStar-Gate's) foundation I set fast at the surface of Apsu at the depth of the "waters of the foundation-pit" (i.e., the ground waters)
Nonetheless, a passage in Enki and Ninma/; and a bilingual incantation seem to understand asurrakku as '(place of/where) a.sur.ra (flowing waters, roiled waters, deep waters)' from sur = ~arti.ru.64 In Enki and Ninmah 13, engur. buru, the deep Apsu, is described as a place where water flows:
62 Such a culvert can be compared with Sennacherib's aqueduct tunnel (described
in OIP 24 47-49) and the Negub tunnel (see c. Davey, Iraq 47 49-55).
63 See CAD B 213. Less likely is sur = suru 'ditch' and other homonyms (see CAD S 415-16).
64 For sur = $araru A, see CAD $ 105-6.

Benito Enki 22:13
Enki, in the deep Apsu, where water flows, into which no god can see
The same meaning of a.sur.ra is evident in a bilingual incantation in the context of waters belonging to EnkilEa, the king of the Apsu:
a.sur.ra den.ki.ke4 sag bi.in.ga.ga [(x x x)]
sa a-na me-e ~ar-ru-ti sa de-a Cl-ir-[ru]

CT 1734:23-26 (w. Romer, Fest. Sj0berg 468:12-13)
Any (demon) who goes against the flowing water of Ea; let the trap of Ea catch [him].
Yet a third etymology, a.sud.ra, '(place of) distant/deep waters', is suggested by Antagal III 15, where asurrakku translates a.su(d).ra 'distant/deep waters' (MSL 17 150). Both the Sumerian hymn ZA 52 59:6 and the bilingual fragment BA 5646:5-6 describe the abzu = apsu as distant/deep (see p. 342). No Sumerian etymology of anzanunzu seems obvious, so the word may very well be a loanword into Akkadian from a third language. However, it is just possible that the word derives from the Sumerian phrase an.za nu.zu.a 'which Heaven's Edge cannot comprehend'. This phrase occurs in the context of the Apsu in Reisman Two-Hymns 46:43-44 and A. K. Sj0berg, OrSuec. 23/24 166:15' (see p. 308).
lalgar
The equation lalgar = apsu in Malku I 291 (JAOS 83 429; see p. 307) demonstrates that lalgar is in some sense a synonym for apsu. In all known Akkadian examples of the term, lalgar is written without case endings. This
curious fact may indicate that lalgar is a foreign word.65 Seven examples of the term are known. In three of the seven, lalgar appears alongside names for heaven and earth, demonstrating that lalgar is a cosmic place name. In the bilingual literary fragment LKA 23, IStar takes possesion of heaven, earth, and lalgar:
[x x bara].nam.l ugal.an.na.ke4 ul.be su bUn. t [i gal.di]
[ x x ] x pa-rak sar-ru-ut da-nim samee i-/;u-uz [tiz-qur-tum]

65 W G. Lambert in AfO 17319 C no. III identifies the term with the name of the
second king of the Sumerian King List, a. Bd .gar (AS 11 70: 5). See also M. Civil in RA 60 92.

All sources of wisdom, the secret of the exorcist, the sealing of the designs of heaven and earth, the secret of lalgar.
A fourth example of lalgar as a cosmic region may be found in a su.lla to Nabu, where the god is called mukil markas lalgar paqid du6-ku-ga 'holder of
the bond of lalgar, commander of duku' (w. Mayer, Or 59461:7; see p. 316). Although the above examples demonstrate that lalgar can be a cosmic place name, the only direct evidence that identifies lalgar with the cosmic Apsu is found in LKA 23 rev. 12'-13', where lalgar is a home of EnkilEa. However, no surviving text identifies lalgar as a body of water. Thus, if lalgar is to be identified as a name of the cosmic Apsu, the link between lalgar and the Apsu may be that lalgar is associated with wisdom, as in KAR 44 rev. 7-8. Elsewhere, Asarlubi is said to view lalgar and formulate plans in An Address of Marduk to the Demons (w. G. Lambert, AfO 17 313 C 11), and Nineveh is praised as an ancient seat of wisdom where the ni~irti lalgar 'secret of lalgar' is studied, in the inscriptions of Sennacherib (OIP 2 94:63-65; 103:32).66

A four-column god-list from Assurbanipal's library may even identify nagbu with both the god Ea and the name of the Apsu, engur:
en.gur den.engur de -a sa n [a-ag-bi] CT 25 48: 3 + dupl.67
engur: Lord of Engur : Ea of the s[ource].
Although it is clear that nagbu in these contexts can refer to waters normally associated with the Apsu, it is unlikely that nagbu was ever understood as a synonym of apsu, since the word never occurs as an equivalent of any known name of the Apsu. Furthermore, the Apsu itself has its very own nagbu 'source' in identical lines of two incantations:

Neither passage indicates that the cosmic Duku is to be identified with the Apsu. In the Bit Rimki passage, Duku seems to be located along the horizon rather than below the earth's surface. In K. 2873:3-4, the Sumerian equivalent of Akkadian duku includes the name of the underworld, kur, suggesting that duku here is to be identified with the underworld rather than the ApSU.69 A third example may be found in a su.ila where Akkadian dU6-ku occurs in an epithet of Nabu, paralleling lalgar:

The origins of segbar as a name for the Apsu are not clear. A homonym segg.bar = sapparu 'a type of wild goat or sheep' is known, but it is uncertain how such an animal can be related to the Apsu shrines.



Chapter 13
The Geography of Earth
The portion of the cosmos below the heavens consists of solid and liquid elements. Earth is a solid, and the waters of the Apsu and cosmic sea are liquids. Other waters in earth include the rivers, lakes, and streams of the earth's surface and the underworld river Hubur. The waters of lakes and streams drain
into'the sea by means of the ri~ers. There is no statement in Mesopotamian materials that the waters of the underworld river are connected in any way to the sea or bodies of water on the earth's surface. KAR 307 divides the portion of the cosmos below the heaven, like heaven itself, into three levels: an upper earth, middle earth, and lower earth. The Upper Earth is the earth's surface, the home of mankind in the universe. In KAR 307, Marduk settles the spirits of mankind on this level. The Middle Earth is the Apsu, which Marduk assigns to Ea. The Lower Earth is the underworld where Marduk shuts in 600 Anunnaki. KAR 307 does not refer to the ocean. In Sumerian mythology, I the earth is a solid block of matter that is separated from heaven in early times. Heaven and earth are made distant from one another, thereby exposing the dry land on the upper surface of the earth, where mankind is later settled. The underworld below the earth's surface also apparently belongs to this solid block of matter. Sumerian traditions of the separatio~ of heaven and earth do not consider the waters of the Apsu beneath the earth s surface nor the cosmic sea whose surface is visible from the earth's surface. These waters appear to be primordial elements in Sumerian mythology. In Babylonian myths, cosmic waters that eventually form the Apsu and sea are primoridal elements. In Enuma Elish, the divine waters of both the Apsu and the sea-goddess Tiamat exist at the very start of creation. In Ee I 71
1 For the Sumerian and Babylonian accounts of the creation of earth, dry land, and sea, see chapter 6.
318
The Levels of Earth 319
88, the god Apsu is pacified by Ea and put to death. His watery corpse forms the waters of the cosmic region Apsu. The sea-goddess Tiamat is slain in Ee IV. After the heavens are built from the upper half of her corpse in Ee IV 137-46, parts of the lower half of her body are used to form mountains, the springs of the Tigris and Euphrates, and other cosmic features (Ee V 1-60). Then, in Ee V 61-64, Marduk hoists the heavens upward over earth and then releases his net, allowing any remaining parts of Tiamat's corpse to escape:
61. [He set up] her crotch wedging up the heavens, 62. [her half which h]e made as a roof, earth was set firm.
63. [After] he completed the work inside the sea. 64. [He loosene]d his net and let it out completely. Ee V 61-64 (see p. 119)
Here, waters of the primeval sea-goddess are apparently released from Marduk's net, thereby creating the cosmic sea. In The Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk, the sea (tamtu0 exists at the start of creation, before ancient cities are built, and the topographical features of the earth's surface are formed on top of a raft floating on the primordial sea. Likewise, in The Babyloniaca of Berossus, the Sea-Goddess exists before Bel fashions the rest of the universe. A different tradition is found in The Theogony of Dunnu, where the gods bring the goddess Sea into existence with their plow (CT 46 43:4; see p. 146). Here the gods apparently dig the hollow of the sea, so the sea-floor is in effect an extension of the earth's surface.2
The Levels of Earth
The Level of the Earth's Surface (Dry Land and Sea)
The portion of the earth visible to living human beings is formed by the upper surfaces of two cosmic regions: earth itself, and the sea. These are visible to mankind as dry land and the surface of the sea, respectively. The earth's surface is the highest level of earth. With a few notable exceptions-such as Etana and Adapa, who travel to the heavens-living human beings are limited to this level. The relative position of the earth's surface, between the lowest heaven and Apsu in KAR 307, is confirmed by other texts. For instance, in Ee V 119-22, the site of Babylon on the earth's surface is placed between Enlil's region of heaven, Esarra, and the Apsu. Although dry land and the sea belong to separate cosmic entities and mountains can stretch thousands of feet above sea level, there is no suggestion

320 The Geography of Earth
that dry land and the sea surface do not share a single level of the universe. The depths of the sea, however, are sometimes identified with the Apsu (see p. 340). Further confusion between the sea and Apsu arises in The Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk, where waters beneath the world raft are identified as tamtu 'sea', rather than Apsu.
The Geography of the Earth's Surface
Although Sumerian and Akkadian texts contain a vast amount of geographical information, only two sources, The Babylonian Map of the World and The Sargon Geography, provide descriptions of the earth's surface. In both texts, the earth's surface consists of a central continent, sea, and territories across the sea (see pp. 93-94). This tripartite view of the earth's surface fits well with information from other texts. In Gilg. IX-X, Gilgamesh travels from Uruk to the home of UtnapiStim. During this journey, Gilgamesh passes the cosmic mountain, Mount Masu, and traverses the 7:Jarran dsamsi 'Path of the Sun' on his way to the shores of a cosmic sea that only the Sun normally crosses. Then, Gilgamesh sails across this cosmic sea, which includes the me muti 'waters of death', before finally reaching his destination. When he arrives, he tells UtnapiStim that he has passed lands, mountains, and seas:
I wandered and walked through all the lands. I traversed difficult mountains. I crossed all the seas. Thompson Gilg. X v 25-27 (see p. 96)
The level of the earth's surface in this context consists of a continent where Uruk and Mount Masu are situated, the cosmic sea with the waters of death, and the home of Utnapistim across the sea. Parallels are found in first-millennium royal inscriptions. Nebuchanezzar II claims universal kingship over both the dadmu 'inhabited world' from the Upper to the Lower Sea, as well as nagu 'regions' across the sea (VAB 4 146 ii 17-33; see p. 31). Neo-Assyrian kings also claim territories across the seas, including Dilmun in the lower sea, Lydia neberti 'across' the Upper Sea (Streck Ash. 20:95, 166:13), and Iadnana (Cyprus), Tarsis, and Iaman (Ionian Greece) qabal 'in' the Upper Sea (Borger Esarh. 86 no. 57:7-10). Later, in the inscriptions of Xerxes, the Greek homeland in Europe is placed across the sea:
mat ia-a-man-na sa ina idmar-rat as-bu-u u sa a-7:Ju-ul-lu-u sa idmar-rat as-bu-u
Herzfeld API 30 no. 14:18-19
The Land of the Greeks who live in the ocean, and on the far side of the ocean.
Many of these lands, including Greece, Lydia, and Tarsis, are in reality on the Eurasian land-mass but were normally reached by sea in ancient times and thus classified as lands across the sea.
The Continent 321
The Continent
Mesopotamian geographers had no way of knowing that Babylonia and Assyria were part of the Eurasian land-mass that stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Arctic to Indian oceans. The ancient geographers imagined that the continent they lived on was much smaller. On the World Map, the cosmic ocean marratu is drawn just beyond Assyria, Urartu, and mountains where the Euphrates rises, while more distant areas are drawn as nagu across the marratu.
The author of The Sargon Geography also believed that the continent was relatively small. The m01't distant areas in The Sargon Geography are the Cedar Mountain in the north, the land of Ansan in the south, Marbasi in the east, and Egypt in the west. Although the author of the text does not explicitly state that the cosmic sea flowed beyond these lands, this can be inferred from Sargon Geography 33-42, which lists the circumferences of eight continental countries (Marbasi, Tukris, Elam, Akkad, Subartu, Amurru, Lullubi, and Ansan), followed by the names of the lands across the Upper and Lower Seas. The eight continentallands encompass an area comparable to the continent on the World Map (see pp. 93-94). Evidence from third-millennium royal inscriptions and geographic lists suggests that the World Map and Sargon Geography present commonly-held views of the geography of the continent. For example, the third-millennium empire of Sargon of Akkad, with the addition of Egypt, is nearly identical to the empire in The Sargon Geography, and the realm of Lugalzagesi, as described in "The Vase Inscription" (BE I12 87), is similar to the sketch of the continent on the World Map:
U4 den.iil lugal.kur.kur.ra.ke4 1ugal.za.ge.si nam.lugal.kalam.ma e.na.sum.ma.a igi.kalam.ma.ke4 si
e.na.sa.a kur.kur glri.na e.nLsi.si.ga.a utu.e.ta utu.su.se gu e.na.gar.ra.a u4.ba a.ab.ba sig.ta.ta idigna buranuna.be a.ab.ba igLnim.ma.se glri.bi si e.na.sa u tu.e. ta u tu.su.se [de] n.lil.le [ga ba.s] u.gar [n] u.m u.ni.tuku BE I12 87 i 36-ii 16 (collated J, Cooper, JCS 32 117-18)
When Enlil, the King of the Lands, gave Lugalzagesi the kingship of the country, set his way at "eye of the land;'3 brought down the lands at his feet, and made them submit to him from sunrise to sunset, at that time, from the Lower Sea, along the Tigris and Euphrates, to the Upper Sea, he made the campaigns against them proceed. Enlil did [n]ot allow any [ri]val from sunrise to sunset.
3 The phrase igi.kalam.ma is problematic. A temple e.igi.kalam.ma of Lugalmarada in Marad is known (see George Temples 104), but it seems unlikely that this temple can be related to EnUl's decision to grant Lugalzagesi universal kingship. An Akkadian equivalent, fnu miltim 'eye of the land', occurs as an epithet of the Sun and Moon gods in personal names (see CAD I 156 d).



322 The Geography of Earth
In the passage, the empire of Lugalzagesi extends from the Lower Sea, along the course of the Tigris and Euphrates, to the Upper Sea following the course of a campaign from southern Sumer to the Mediterranean coast. On the map, the Euphrates flows through nearly the entire length of the continent, from the upper part of the world ocean to the rectangle labeled 'channel and swamp' (bitqu, apparu) that touches the lower part of the world ocean. A second-millennium view of the continent may be found in the land lists of Urra XXI that were composed during the very late Old Babylonian period or the Kassite period4 and the land lists of the slightly later Ras Shamra and Emar parallels to Urra. Urra XXI itself preserves two sub-lists of land-names: one list in which Sumerian land-names are prefixed with kur, and a second list in which Sumerian land-names are prefixed with ma.da. The lists are known from two editions of the series:
I. A Middle Assyrian edition from Assur preserving the kur list is
represented by KAV 80+90+137(+)89 (see w. Horowitz, AfO 35 64-72). II. A Babylonian version preserving both kur and ma.da lists is known from Ashmolean 1924.798+ (a tablet from Kish), BM 40739, and two exercise tablets (S and X below).

nium exemplars of the full series have survived. Nonetheless, the existence of Middle
Assyrian, Ras Shamra, and Emar parallels to Urra from the second millennium indicates
that a Middle Babylonian version of the series circulated as welL It is unlikely that Urra
could have been compiled any earlier than the late Old Babylonian period, since Old
Babylonian single-column precursors to later lexical series are characteristic of this time.
Thus the most probable date for the earliest edition of the series is the Kassite period, al
though a very late Old Babylonian date cannot be completely ruled out. See also M. Civil

324 The Geography of Earth
Together the three sub-lists preserve 15 identifiable land-names: Sumer, Sumer
and Akkad, Emutbal, Subartu, Elam, Guti, pat quti 'The Land at the Border of Guti', The Upper Land, The Lower Land, The Cedar Land, MarhasilParasi, Bitala, ljani, Lullubi and Amurru. The Ras-Shamra and Emar parallels to Urra preserve parallellists:5

Emar (kur) Emar 558 59'-68'
Cedar Land Subartu Guti The Land at the Border of Guti Amurru Marhasi si.rum sir.rum Upper Land Lower Land
All the lands in the Ras Shamra and Emar lists also occur in the Urra lists. Furthermore, both lists end with the Upper and Lower Lands, as do the kur-list of the Middle Assyrian recension of Urra and the Babylonian ma.da-list. With the possible exception of the Upper and Lower Lands, all of the countries in the lists lie within the land borders of Sargon's empire in The Sargon Geography. In Sargon Geography 41-42, lands across the Upper and Lower Seas are listed after the eight continental lands in Sargon Geography 33-40.
The Four Regions of the Earth's Surface
Various Sumerian and Akkadian terms for 'the Four Quarters' or 'Four ' Regions' refer to the division of the earth's surface into equal northern, southern, eastern, and western quadrants. These quadrants correspond to the four compass point directions. As demonstrated by the diagram on BagM Beih. 2 98 (see p. 194), these quadrants are arranged so as to form four equal regions when transposed on a modern map with north at the top.
5 Note also the kur-list in MSL 11 55:15-56:4 (Misc. Geographical List 1) and parallel lists of languages (Sumerian, Akkadian, Amorite, Elamite, Gutian, Subartean, Sutean) in MSL SSllO xi 28'-33', 12 iii' 7'-11', 24:30-34, 32:240-45.

The diagram may also provide a pictorial representation of the geographic terms 'The Circle of the Four Winds', 'The Circle of the Four Corners', 'The Circle of the Four Regions', and 'The Circle of the Winds' (see p. 205). On BagM Beih. 2 98, the area outside the circle may be labeled marratu
'ocean' (see p. 195). If so, the area inside the circle may be equivalent to the continent on World Map that is encircled by a cosmic ocean marratu. In this case, the continent alone, rather than the entire level of the earth's surface, may be divided into four quadrants. Elsewhere, however, 'The Four World Regions' seem to stretch to the very ends of the earth. In World Map rev. 26', the phrase kibrati erbetti sa kal ... 'The Four Quadrants of the entire ...' occurs after the descriptions of nagu across the marratu from the continent. Likewise, Shamash Hymn 11-12 appears to identify kibrat erbetti as the entire level of the earth's surface beneath the Sun:

The Sea
The Babylonian Map of the World and The Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk demonstrate that Babylonians, at least, believed that a cosmic ocean encircled the continental portion of the earth's surface. The most familiar parts of the this ocean were the Upper Sea (Mediterranean) and the Lower Sea (Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean), but it is clear from the World Map that the cosmic ocean was also believed to flow to the east of Babylonia beyond Iran, and to the north of the mountains of modern Turkey. The tradition of a northern part of the ocean may have been influenced in part by vague knowledge of the Black and Caspian seas. Additional northern upper seas, including the "seas" of Nairi and Zamua (see p. 303), are mentioned in Assyrian royal inscriptions beginning at the time



326 The Geography of Earth
of Tukulti-Ninurta I. These seas, however, are inland lakes such as Lake Van and Lake Urmia that, like the ocean, have no egress.
The Depth of the Sea
The only exact figure provided for the depth of the sea is found in Erra I 152 where the roots of a cosmic mesu-tree are said to reach 100 leagues
thr~ugh the tamtum rapastum 'vast sea' to the underworld (see p. 245). This passage, however, may confuse the waters of the Apsu with the depths of the sea, since the Apsu lies between the earth's surface and the underworld according to KAR 307.6
The Limits of the Sea
Available evidence for the far limits of the sea is problematic. On the World Map, the far shore of the marratu is drawn as a circle. Beyond this circle, uncharted space extends to the ends of the tablet. Triangular-shaped nagu extend into this uncharted territory. Because the area beyond the marratu is not labeled, it is not possible to determine if a cosmic sea beyond the marratu extends to the ends of the earth's surface, if the nagu hang over the horizon, or if a second continent lies beyond the marratu (see p. 32). A more mysterious tradition concerning the far reaches of the sea is included in The Gilgamesh Epic. In Gilg. X, Gilgamesh and UrSanabi encounter the me mati 'waters of death' in a distant part of the sea on the way to the home of UtnapiStim at ina pi narati (see pp. 103-4). Here too it is unclear if the 'waters of death' extend to the ends of the earth's surface.
Features of the Sea
sigaru nabbalu tamti 'The Bolt (Named) "Net of the Sea"'. The term sigaru na/:}balu tamti occurs six times in the Late Babylonian F~~od St~ry ~E 39099 (Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 116-21) and probably an addItIOnal time III Old Babylonian Atra-/:}as'is (Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 42:15). In both accounts, the sigaru na/:}balu tamti belongs to EnkilEa, but it is not certain if the tern;- refers to one item or two. The term, as written, can best be translated bolt (named) "Net of the Sea''', since both sigaru and na/:}balu are, as written, in the
nominative case. The sigaru na/:}balu tamti can be at least partially identified by examining the the meanings of sigaru and na/:}balu. A sigaru is a bolt on a door. In the context of the sea, the sigaru na/:}balu tamti may be a bolt on a water-lock that holds the waters of the sea in place. Such a bolt (sigaru) appears in the Late Babylonion flood story twice in the context of the killing of the 'guards of the

The Sea 327
sea' (mal?l?aril tamti) (Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 118:23-24, 120:39-40). A na/:}balu is a net or snare of some sort. It is apparently made of both netting and a wooden frame, since a common Sumerian equivalent of the term, gises.sa.du (see CAD Nil 134), is written with the gis 'wood' determinative and means literally 'made of netting and rope' (es = aslu, sa = saul. Objects made even in part of netting are porous, so it is not clear how a na/:}balu could restrain the sea. Thus na/:}balu tamti 'Net of the Sea' seems to be a proper name rather than an actual object and, if so, may be the name of the 'bolt of the sea'.7 Although the exact function of the sigaru na/:}balu tamti is not explained in the Mesopotamian flood stories, it can be compared with doors and a bar that hold the sea in place in the biblical book of Job:
And who shut in the sea with doors when it burst forth coming out of the womb, when I made a cloud as its cover, and fog its swaddling band? It is I who imposed my laws upon it and stationed a bar and doors. Then I said "to this point you may come, but no more, for here your prideful waves will be destroyed." Job 38:8-11
In this passage, the function of the bar and doors of the sea is to keep the waters of the sea within their bounds. The sigaru na/:}balu tamti was probably meant to serve the same purpose, since it is mentioned in connection with the flood, a time when the normal restraints of the sea may have been removed.
The bargullu 'Lock' of the Sea. In addition to the sigaru na/:}balu tamti, the waters of the sea may have also been held in check by locks. An obscure reference to such locks is found in an astronomical omen:
dadad sa sadi II sa tamti(a.ab.ba) /:}ar-gal-li-sa BI.BI
ACh Adad 17:34
Adad will ... the locks of the mountain/sea.
A second reference to the locks may occur in a broken passage near the end of an Esarhaddon inscription:
aban(na4) na-de-e /:}ar-gul-li I?e-res tam-tim . ..
BA 3 297:52 (Borger Esarhaddon 85)
A stone for placing locks against the sea/Tiamat ...
7 The name 'Net of the Sea' may be compared with the net saparru that Marduk uses against Tiamat in Ee IV-V (see also CAD S 161-62 saparru A b).



328 The Geography of Earth
Regions across the Sea and the Ends of the Earth's Surface
Although Mesopotamian texts often speak of distant areas across the seas, and the ends of the earth's surface beyond, information relating to the far reaches of the earth's surface is limited. Most of what is known about distant regions across the seas comes from three sources: references to Dilmun, Magan, and MelulJlJa in third-millennium texts, the descriptions of the nagu in The Babylonian Map of the World, and information in Gilgamesh IX-X Most of the available information concerning the actual ends of the earth's surface relates to the place where the Sun-god crosses the boundary between heaven and earth as he rises and sets.
Dilmun, Magan, and Melul:Jl:Ja
The lands of Dilmun, Magan, and MelulJlJa are located down the Persian Gulf from Mesopotamia. In Sargon Geography 30, Magan and MelulJlJa are placed 120 leagues from the outlet of the Euphrates, and Dilmun and Magan are located across the Lower Sea in Sargon Geography 42. In third-millennium texts, the lands of Dilmun, Magan, and MelulJlJa are often grouped together as trading partners of Sumer and Akkad. For example, boats bring trade goods from all three lands to the quays of Akkad in the inscriptions of Sargon of Akkad (H. Hirsch, AfO 20 37:8-13; Gelb-Kienast 164). Modern research has identified the third-millennium locations of all three lands. Dilmun has been identified with Bahrain, Magan has been identified with the upper Persian Gulf Coast including modern Oman, and MelulJlJa has been identified with the Indus Valley Culture. In third-millennium sources, MelulJlJa always lies across the sea from Sumer. Magan could also be reached by sea but may have been accessible by overland travel as well, since it is much closer to southern Mesopotamia. In the inscriptions of Naram-Sin and The Chronicle of Early Kings, Naram-Sin mounts a successful campaign against Magan (MDP 6 3 ii 1-7; Grayson Chronicles 154:27).8 Unfortunately, neither source explains how Naram-Sin reached Magan. Third-millennium texts demonstrate that Dilmun was a sacred locale, as well as a trading partner of Sumer and Akkad. In Sumerian literature, Dilmun is both the setting for the myth Enki and Ninl:Jursag (P. Attinger, ZA 74 1-52) and the eventual home of Ziusudra, the hero of the Sumerian flood story:
u4.ba zi.u4.sud4.ni lugal.am mu.nl.gilim.ma numun.nam.lu.ulu urLaka kur.bal kur.dilmun.na ki.dutu.e.se mu.un.ti.es PBS 5 1 vi 10-12 (Lambert-Millard Atra-lJasis 145:258-60)
8 Note also the inscribed bowl of Naram-Sin in The Bible Lands Museum, Jerusalem, which is identified as "Booty of Magan" (see O. Muscarella, ed., Ladders to Heaven, 80; Guide to the Collection of the Bible Lands Museum, Jerusalem [1994] 38).
Regions across the Sea and the Ends of the Earth's Surface
At that time, Ziusudra, the king, the one who protected the seed of mankind during the era of disaster they settled in the "Land of the Crossing;' the Land of Dilmun, ' a place in the direction of the rising sun.
329
After the Ur III period, contact with the three lands diminished but the
name~ of. Dil~un, Magan, and MelulJlJa continued to be remembered in geo
?rap~IC lIsts, lIterary texts, and historical omens, as well as through goods
Id~ntIfie.d as be~ng of the Dilmun, Magan, or MelulJlJa type. 9 Later in the second
n:lllenmum, eVIde~ce for. direct contact with these three lands reappears. A Kas
sIte governor of Dilmun IS known from a cylinder seal (see J. Brinkman. NABU 199389-91, no. 106). The name of Dilmun also occurs in two Kassite letters as well as in the inscriptions of the Middle Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I ;ho
adopts ~he ro~al title "King of Dilmun and MelulJlJa" (see RGTC 5 261). 'Elsewhere In the Inscriptions, Tukulti-Ninurta's empire is said to extend to the border of Magan (see RGTC 5 182).10
. In the ~rst .mil~ennium., all three lands occur in Neo-Assyrian inscriptions.
Dllmun, whICh lIes In th~ mlddl~ of the sea in the inscriptions of Assurbanipal, Sargon II, and Sennachenb, contInues to be a name for Bahrain, but Magan and MelulJlJa are moved from the Persian Gulf to the borders of Egypt.
The nagu on the World Map
~ortions ?f five nagu are preserved across the marratu on the map itself, and eIght nagu are described on the reverse of the tablet. When complete, both the map and the descriptions on the reverse probably revealed a tremendous amount of information about distant areas, but even the small amount of information that is preserved reveals that distant lands were believed to be strange and wondrous places. For example, the northern nagu on the map is said to be a place where the "sun is not seen;' and the seventh nagu on the reverse (rev. 21'-23') is inhabited by speedy horned cattle.
Gilgamesh
Distant areas in The Gilgamesh Epic are also filled with wonders. Beyond
the sh~~~s of the .continent, 'waters of death' flow in a cosmic sea (Gilg. X iv), and ?tnapIsbm, the Immortal survivor of the flood, lives in a region beyond the waters of death'. The distant part o~ the continent is also filled with stange and
wondro~s phenomena. Before reachIng the seacoast, Gilgamesh passes a cosmic mountaIn where fantastic beings, who are part-human and part-scorpion,
obs~rve the Sun (Gilg. IX ii); he travels along a 12-league-long path through a regIOn of darkness (Gilg. IX iv-v); and finally he reaches a grove where trees

330 The Geography of Earth
bear precious stones instead of fruit (Gilg. IX v-vi). These episodes in The Gilgamesh Epic provide further evidence that Mesopotamians believed that distant lands were very different from their own. Such beliefs were not unfounded, since Neo-Assyrian kings brought strange and wondrous plants and beasts back with them from their campaigns in distant lands. These included trees that bore wool for making clothing instead of food to eat (OIP 2111:56,116:64) and pagu and pagitu 'male and female monkeys', which are depicted in Neo-Assyrian reliefs with almost-human heads, hands, and feet, but animal bodies,l1
The Ends of the Earth's Surface
All of the available evidence agrees that the earth's surface ends at the horizon, the place where heaven and earth meet. Yet, there is widespread disagreement about the topography of the ends of the earth's surface. Some texts suggest that the ends of the earth's surface are marked by cosmic mountains, while others suggest that the cosmic ocean extends to the ends of the earth. Still others are ambiguous.
The Sun and the Ends of the Earth's Surface. Evidence for the course of the Sun defining the limits of the earth's surface is found in royal inscriptions and literary texts. In Late Babylonian royal inscriptions, Neriglissar claims to rule all of mankind on the earth's surface under the sun from horizon to zenith:
is-tu isid same(an.ur) a-di eLM same(an.pa) e-ma dsamas a-$u-u sa sarrani (l ugal.l ugal) ki-ib-ra-a-ti sa ka-al te-ne-se-e-ti bi-Ia-at-su-nu ka-bi-it-ti lu-um-J:ju-ur qe-er-bu-us-sa
1R 67 ii 37-40 (VAB 4 214)
From horizon to zenith, wherever the sun goes out, may I receive the heavy tribute of the kings of the world regions of all mankind in (my palace).
Tiglath-Pileser III (Tadmor Tigl. 158:4, 194:4) and Nebuchadnezzar (VAB 4 120:52, 140 x 13) also claim kingdoms from 'horizon to zenith', and Sargon of Akkad rules all the lands siJ:jip same 'under heaven' in Sargon Geography 31. Likewise, all the lands extend from 'sunrise to sunset' (a$e dsamsi adi ereb dsamsi) in Underworld Vision 63 (SAA 374:23), and from 'horizon to zenith' in ' a Gilgamesh letter from Sultantepe:

who (Gilgamesh), as if with a ... cord rules all the lands from horizon to zenith.
II For a detailed discussion of Gilgamesh's journey to ina pi narati, see Chapter 5.
Regions across the Sea and the Ends of the Earth's Surface 331
The Ends of the Earth's Surface, Mountains, and Regions of Darkness. Evidence that the Sun-god passes over mountains as he rises at dawn is found in a number of texts. Two sources suggest that these mountains lie at the very ends of the earth's surface. In Bit Rimki, the Sun-god rises by a mountain identified with the shrine Duku at the horizon: 12
Sun-god, when you rise from the Great Mountain, when you rise from the Great Mountain, the "Mountain of the Spring;' when you rise from Duku, the place where the destinies are determined,
when you rise at the place where heaven and earth embrace at the
horizon. . , R. Borger, JCS 21 2:1-3:4 (see p. 316)
In a Sumerian passage in a hymn to Enlil, the mountains of sunrise and sunset also seem to be equated with the edges of heaven and earth:
u.mu.un za.an.na u.mu.un za.kiJke41
kur.utu.e.a.ta kur.utu.su.a.se kur.ra u.mu.un nu.mu.un.ti za.e u.um.un ab.ak dmu.ul.lil kur.kur.ra ga.sa.an nu.mu.un.ti dam.zu ga.sa.an ab.ak R. Kutscher, Oh Angry Sea 61:25-29 (Cohen Canonical Lamentations 339-40)
Lord, as far as the edge of heaven, lord as far as the edge of earth, from the mountain of sunrise to the mountain of sunset. In the mountain/land, no (other) lord resides, you exercise lordship. Enlil, in the lands no (other) lady resides, your wife, exercises ladyship.
These passages may be related to Old Akkadian cylinder seals that picture the Sun-god rising by a gate over a hillock. The gate may be identified as a gate of sunrise, and the hillock may represent the mountain of sunrise (see R. M. Boehmer, ZA Erganzungsbande 4 pIs. 33-36).13 In other possible parallels, mountains of sunrise and sunset may be located at the far ends of the central continent, rather than across the sea at the edge of the earth. These include a hymn to Inanna, where the Sun rises from kur. sim.giSeren 'the mountain of cedar scent' (CT 36 34 rev. 3-4),14 and a bilingual
12 For both cosmic and non-cosmic examples of du 6.kil, see pp. 315-16.
~3 Note also Urra XXII (MSL 11 23:5 II SpTU III 114:5) and Lipsur Type I 1:4 (E. Remer, JNES) 5 132:4) where Mt. Buduhudug is explained as nereb dsamas ana daja 'the entrance of Samas to Aya'. For mountains of sunrise and sunset, see also W. Heimpel, JCS 38 143-46; W. G. Lambert, JCS 41 5 i 1; MSL 11 38 b 4-5. 14 The rising of the sun from the Cedar Mountains both here and in other passages (see Tigay Gilg. 77 n. 11) indicates that the Cedar Mountain included mountains to the east of Mesopotamia during Sumerian times, as well as the Lebanon range in the
,,:,est. This b:ings th.e commonly accepted identification of giseren = 'cedar' into question, smce there IS no eVIdence for true cedars east of Mesopotamia. Thus, giseren in the east

. CT 16 44:84-87 (98-101)
They are seven (demons) who were born in the Dark Mountains (Akk. The Mountain of Sunset).
They are seven demons who were raised in the Bright Mountains (Akk. Mountain of Sunrise).
This dark mountain of sunset may be compared with Mt. Masu in Gilg. IX, where Gilgamesh encounters a region of darkness (see pp. 98-100). Mt. Masu, of course, is located on the central continent. Gilgamesh only reaches the sea coast in Gilg. X after crossing Mt. Masu and the region of darkness. Sargon of Akkad encounters a similar region of darkness in the mountains east of Mesopotamia (see p. 33). On the World Map, however, a region "where the sun is not seen" is located across the northern portion of the cosmic ocean marratu from the mountain on the continent.
The Cosmic Ocean, the Sun, and the Ends of the Earth's Surface. In The Gilgamesh Epic, The Babylonian Map of the World, and Sumerian works, seas lie beyond mountains of sunrise and sunset. In Gilg. IX-X, Gilgamesh encounters the sea (tamtu) and the 'waters of death' after passing Mt. Masu, where scorpion-men observe the rising and setting of the Sun. The prologue to The Gilgamesh Epic indicates that the waters crossed by Gilgamesh may extend as far as the place of sunrise in the east:
[e-b]ir a-abJba1 [t]a-ma-ti rapasti ti adi ~it samsi(dutu.e)
Gilg. I i 38 (Iraq 37 pl. 37)
(Gilgamesh) who crossed the ocean, the vast sea, as far as the sunrise.
On the World Map, the cosmic ocean marratu flows beyond a region marked, 'mountain' upstream from Babylon and Assyria. Sumerian evidence for cosmic seas located beyond mountains is found in the Sumerian literary composition Inanna and the King:

From sunrise to sunset, from the northwind to the southwind, from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, from the 1:Juluppu-tree, from the cedar, in Sumer and Akkad, give him the scepter and staff.
333
In the passage, the author seems to work from the outer ends of the earth's surface inward, beginning with sunrise and sunset and ending with Sumer and Akkad. Thus the seas seem to be beyond distant eastern lands where 1:Juluppu
trees grow, such as Magan and Melubba (see CAD tJ 56), and the distant western mountains, where cedars grow. A parallel may be found in The Shamash Hymn where the Sun rises over the sea and then crosses mountains each day: 15

BWL 12627-30
Together, these passages indicate that at least some ancient Mesopotamian geographers conceived of the continental portion of the earth's surface as a flat plain ringed by mountains and surrounded by the waters of a cosmic ocean.
The Ends of the Earth in the World Map and Sargon Geography. Neither the World Map nor The Sargon Geography provide clear descriptions of the ends of the earth's surface. On the map, an uncharted blank area stretches beyond the far shore of the marratu and most distant points of the nag£!. Similarly, the preserved portion of the The Sargon Geography does not explain what lies beyond the distant lands of Dilmun, Melubba, Anaku, and Kaptara. Such ambiguities and the existence of conflicting traditions concerning the ends of the earth's surface reflect the fact that little was actually known about distant areas during antiquity. In the words of the author of The Shamash Hymn, knowledge of the far reaches of the earth's surface was not one of the privileges of mankind, but the prerogative of Shamash, who moved daily over the entire expanse of the earth's surface:

The Shape of the Level of the Earth's Surface
All of the available evidence demonstrates that the earth's surface was thought to be basically circular in shape. The geographic terms kippat matiiti 'circle of the lands', kippat erf}eti 'circle of earth', kippat tubuqat erbetti 'circle of the four corners', kippat sar erbetti 'circle of the four winds', and kippat erbetti 'circle of the four (regions), (see CAD K 399 3), if understood literally, demonstrate that the earth's surface was a circle. Similarly, the author of the World Map drew the level of the earth's surface as two concentric circles, with nagu radiating from the outer circle. On BagM Beih. 2 98, the names of the south wind and west wind are inscribed by triangles inside a square that is itself drawn inside a circle. This square apparently corresponds to the geographic concept of 'The Four Corners' or 'The Four Regions' (see p. 204). Thus, the placement of the square inside a circle in BagM Beih. 298 may illustrate that 'The Four CornerslRegions' were thought to be located inside a circle defining the borders of the earth's surface, or earth's surface and sea.
The Size of the Level of the Earth's Surface
No ancient text measures the dimensions of the earth's surface. However modern calculations based on distances between ziqpu-stars in the astronomical text AO 6478 indicate that the level of the earth's surface could have a diameter of 218,400 leagues in this text (see p. 187). This figure, though, is incredibly large when compared with the size of lands in Sargon Geography 33-40 and the scale of the World Map.
The Apsu
In KAR 307, the Apsu 16 is the middle earth, is located between the earth's surface and the underworld, and belongs to Ea. The Apsu also lies beneath the earth's surface and belongs to EnkilEa in the cosmographies of Enuma Elish, Atra-bas'is, and The Gilgamesh Epic. In Ee IV 137-46, Marduk assigns the Apsu to Ea. Later in Ee V 119-22, Marduk indicates that the city of Babylon on the earth's surface is to be located above the Apsu. The mystical-religous work Livingstone 116:2 (= SAA 3 96:8-9) also relates that Marduk sent Ea down to
16 For a previous study of Apsu and related topics, see Green Eridu 160-69.
The Apsu 335
the Apsu (see l 17). In Old Babylonian Atra-bas'is, Ea descends to the Apsu from the earths surface when Anu ascends to heaven, and Enlil remains on the earth's surface (Lambert-Millard Atra-basls 42:17-18; see p. 113). In Gilg. XI 41-42, UtnapiStim tells his fellow citizens of Uruk that he is building his ark because he must abandon the qaqqar denlil 'earth of Enlil' (earth's surface) and descend to join Ea in the Apsu. N? Sumerian text preserves an account of the creation of the Apsu or the ~ep~ratlOn of the Apsu from heaven and earth in early times. This apparently ~ndlCates th~t. the Sumerians conceived the Apsu to be a primordial element, Just as the dlvme Apsu exists at the very start of Enuma Elish. In Enki and Nin~ab, for exa~pl~, the Apslt alre~dy exists in EN 12-14, where Enki is present m engur.buru the deep Apsu, although the Apsu is not mentioned when heaven and earth are separated in EN 1-2 (see p. 138),17 In Ee I, the deified Apsu is one of two primordial elements the other
being the deified sea (Tiamat). The cosmic Apsu is formed from th~ corpse of the deposed god Apsu and remains intact throughout the epic. In contrast, Tiamat is butchered into a number of cosmic features. The incantation When Anu Built the Heavens disagrees. Here Ea builds the Apsu just as Anu builds his region:
When Anu built the heavens; Nudimmud built the Apsu, his home Ea in the Apsu pinched off clary]. Weissbach Bab. Misc. no. 12:24-26 + duplicates (see pp. 149-50)
In both Sumerian and Akkadian texts, the Apsu is identified as a watery region rather than a solid earth. In numerous instances the Apsu is inhabited by fish (CAD A/2 194 b), and Ea establishes his home over the cosmic Apsu amidst the waters of the slain god Apsu in Ee I 61-78.
The Apsu in Sumerian and Akkadian Texts
Mesopotamian texts preserve a number of different views of the Apsu. The Apsu is both a cosmic region on a par with the heavens, earth's surface, and underworld, while the waters of the Apsu occur as the waters of the water table just beneath the earth's surface, waters in marshes and swamps, waters in rivers, waters in the sea, and distant cosmic waters. On a few other occasions the
Apsu even seems to be confused with the underworld. In order to unders~and the overall Mesopotamian conception of the Apsu, these various aspects must first be examined separately.
17 The Apsu may also exist as a primordial element before the separation of heav:n ar:d earth in Gilgamesh and the ljuluppu-Tree and NBC 11108 (see p. 139). Note
also III thIS context the learned association: ullanu = dea = mu 'primordial = Ea = waters' (see Livingstone 74).



336 The Geography of Earth
The Apsu as a Cosmic Region
The tradition of the Apsu as an independent cosmic region is better attested in Akkadian texts than in Sumerian' texts. The Apsu is one of the six regions that comprise the universe in KAR 307, one of at least four regions in Enuma Elish, and Ea receives the Apsu as his cosmic realm at the same time that Anu and Enlil occupy the heavens and earth's surface in Old Babylonian Atra-!:Jas'iS (Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 42:11-18).ls In contrast, the Apsu is not considered when cosmic regions are assigned to their leading gods in the cosmological prologues to the Sumerian literary works Gilgamesh and the ljuluppu-Tree, Enki and Ninma!:J, and The Creation of the Pickaxe, or the prologue to the bilingual work KAR 4. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence for the Apsu as a cosmic region in Sumerian literature. The Sumerian hymn STLN 61 i 12-16 lists engur 'Apsu' alongside an and ki 'heaven and earth' (see p. 309); Enki is said to lie in the engur.buru 'deep Apsu' in EN 13; and Apsu and heaven occur in parallelisms in Curse of Agade 72-75 (see p. 247) and Lugalb. 78-79, where the anzu-bird and his wife look for their missing fledgling in heaven above and engur below.
The Apsu, Waters of the Water Table, Marshes, and Swamps
A number of passages indicate that the waters of the Apsu include the waters of the water table. At higher elevations, these waters are not visible. Here, the Apsu is reached by digging downward. At lower elevations these same waters are visible on the earth's surface as the waters in marshes and swamps.
The Apsu and Ground Waters
Most examples where the Apsu is associated with ground waters come from southern Mesopotamia, where the water table is very close to the earth's surface. These include a number of passages where the foundations of temples reach down to Apsu, including Enki's Journey 21-22:
Temple, built of silver and lapiS, whose foundation is fastened on the Apsu. Enki's Journey to Nippur 21-22 (see p. 309)
Parallels in first-millennium Babylonia include the Sargon II inscription, where a quay wall in Babylon is placed in anzanunzu (RIM Annual Review 5 2-3 no. 3), and passages in Late Babylonian royal inscriptions such as VAB 4 86 ii 18-19 (see p. 312 for both), where foundations are placed by Apsu. In Assyria, where ground waters are farther from the earth's surface, the only attested ex

The Apsu 337
ample of foundations resting on the Apsu dates to the reign of Esarhaddon, a time of close cultural ties between Assyria and Babylon.

KAH 127 vi 5'-10' (Borger Esarh. 5 vi 20-23)
above, its top (Ebursaggula's) 19 reaches to heaven; below, its foundations are entwined in the Apsu.
The connection between the Apsu and subsurface waters is also illustrated by passages where bitumen is said to come from the Apsu. In Mesopotamia, bitumen bubbles up to the surface from subterranean sources. One such font of bitumen near modern Hit is described both in the annals of Tukulti
Ninurta II (Scheil TN 16:59-60) and by Herodotus: 2o
There is another city which is eight days journey from Babylon named Is. Here there is a river that is not large and Is is also the name of this river, and the river empties in the Euphrates. From the springs of the river Is, great clods of bitumen rise along with the water. Herodotus I 179
In Mesopotamian sources, both crude bitumen (itf;u) and fine bitumen (kupru) rise up from the nagbu 'underground waters' in The Underworld Vision of An Akkadian Crown Prince (SAA 3 69:9), and bitumen is said to come from abzu in Shulgi D 357-358 (Klein Sulgi 86), and Nanna-Suen's Journey to Nippur:21

Nanna-Suen's Journey to Nippur 47:41-42 (cf. 49:61-62)
(For) the makurru-boat's pitch, to the Apsu, Asimbabbar dispatched a man.
Similarly, clay, which is found just below the surface in almost all of Mesopotamia, is also said to come from the Apsu in texts such as Ninurta and the Turtle OCS 24121:36), Curse of Agade 231, and the incantations STT 198:1-2, CT 17 29:30-31, and When Anu Built the Heavens (Weissbach Bab. Misc. no. 1224-26 + duplicates; see p. 149). In EN 31 and 58, clay found over the Apsu is used in the creation of mankind.
The Apsu, Marshes, and Swamps
Apsu waters belonging to the water table are visible on the earth's surface in marshes and swamps. Reeds from marshes are said to grow in the Apsu in

338 The Geography of Earth
Corpus Urn. 49:1-2 and STT 198:21, 34.22 In a Sumerian hymn to Enlil, fish belonging to engur are placed in a canebrake:
ku6.engur.ra.ke4 giS.gi.a nunuz nu.mu.ni.ib.nu.nu
Reisman Two-Hymns 54:118
The fish of the Apsu would not lay eggs in the canebrake.
In parallel Akkadian passages, fish belonging to apsu inhabit the marshes along the Euphrates near Babylon (Borger Esarh. 14 7c), and apsu-fish from marshes are presented as offerings in the inscriptions of Nebuchanezzar (see CAD I 318 izlJU).23
The Apsu and River Waters
There is evidence associating the Apsu with both cosmic rivers and real rivers on the earth's surface. In An Address to the River of Creation, Ea is said to build his home in the cosmic river instead of the Apsu:
EN at-ta ID ba-na-a-tu[m] ka-la-mu e-nu-ma ilJ-ru-ki iltlnumes rabutumes ina a-lJi-ka is-ku-nu dum-qi ina qer-bi-ka dea(idim) sar apsi ib-na-a su-bat-su
Incantation: You, River, creatress of everything. When the Great Gods dug you, they placed good things on your banks.
STC I 200:1-4 24
Within you, Ea, the King of the Apsu, built his home.
In a later part of another version of the incantation, the river is asked to remove evil from a supplicant by taking it down to the river's apsu:
[es-re-e-t]a ID su-ri-di apsu-ki ID lemnu(bul) sa-a-su ia-a-si u bitia(e.mu) La i-qar-ru-bu
R. Caplice, OrNs 39135:24 (cf. STC I 201:11-12)
[You are strai]ght 0 river. Take it down to your apsu
o river. May that evil not approach me or my house.
In this passage, the depths of the river seem to be called apsu. A related zi.pa formula preserves a tradition that the Divine River is the mother of Apsu:

Sumerian ap.ar is apparently a loanword back into Sumerian from Akkadian apparu 'marsh' or a phonetic writing for *abbarlambar. See also CAD A/2 194 1.b'. 24 For this incantation, see also STC I 201; Caplice OrNs 34 127, 130-31; Or 364, 290. For Divine Rivers, see also CAD Nil 374 1.

In the Akkadian incantation The 21 Poultices, the Apsu is itself a cosmic river or contains a river. At the start of the text, Ea is located by a river named ide.silim.ma mus.bus nunuz ur4.ur4.a.de 'House of Peace where the mus
lJussu Gathers "Eggs"'.25 Nabu then visits Ea in this river in order to take the 21 poultices up to the earth's surface (elatu). Later, we are told that the poultices in the river were inside the Apsu:
[2]1 meli(a.ugu) sa pi(ka) de-a [dnabu] ul-tu ide.silim.ma mus.bus nunuz ur4.ur4.a.de [u]l-tu qe-reb apsi u-se~eL-la

A parallel with a river on the earth's surface is found in Old Babylonian Atra-lJasis where Atra-basls addresses Ea in the Apsu while standing on the banks of a river: 26

25 For the 'eggs' identified as precious stones, see W. G. Lambert, AnSt 30 82-83. Note also the god name dfd.si.limasilim in An II (CT 24 16:25). 26 Compare the following passage in The Destruction of Lagas: abzu e.ga.ka su bi. ti5 '(The Ummaite) laid hands on the abzu of the ditch' (Sollberger Corpus Ukg. 16 iii
11-12). For eg = E = iku (see Ea III 236, MSL 14313).



340 The Geography of Earth
The Apsu and the Sea
The relationship between the Apsu and the sea on the earth's surface is not completely clear. Many passages in Akkadian texts suggest that the two were identical in some way, physically connected, or that the deep part of the ocean was called apsu. The closest association between the Apsu and the Sea may be found in Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk, where the continental portion of the earth's surface is placed on a raft above the waters of a cosmic sea (tamtu), rather than the Apsu (see pp. 130-31). A parallel may be found in an old copy of a curse in an inscription of the Lullubean king Annubanini:
ti-am-ti e-li-tum u sa-pil-tum sa apsi a-bi-[su] u su-~a-[su lil-qu-tu]
MDP 2 68 ii 12-18
Let the Upper and Lower Seas of the Apsu, his father and [his] offspring, [cut off].
Here, the Upper and Lower Seas appear to be part of the Apsu. More recent editions of this inscription no longer confirm the presence of the word apsu in this context (see D. Edzard, AfO 24 74 ii 12-18, RIM 470:5). Other passages identify the Apsu with the Sea. Twice in the The Shamash Hymn, apsu is either a name for the sea or the deep part of the sea. In Shamash Hymn 35-38, the rays of the Sun-god passing over the sea penetrate into apsu, where the lal:Jmu of the sea reside (BWL 128). In other texts, lal:Jmu are usually associated with EnkilEa and the Apsu. Later in Shamash Hymn 171-73, the riches/locust of the sea are said to be in Apsu, and the lal:Jmu are once again in the tamtu: 27
dlal:J-mu s[u-u]t tam]ti sa ma-lu-u pu-lul:J-ta e-ri-ib ta[m]ti sa apsa i-ba-J-u mi-Sir-ti nari sa ir-te-du-u dsamas ina mah-fri1-ka
BWL 136:171-73
The lal:Jmu o[f the se]a who are filled with fearsomeness, the riches of the sea/locust of the sea (shellfish) which passes through the Apsu, the produce of the river which moves, 0 Shamash, before you.
A parallel is found in Shamash Hymn 65-70, where mariners who are about to sink into anzanunzu from the sea surface need to be lifted up by Shamash (BWL 130; see p. 311). Ea himself sees the face of the Sun shining into Apsu in a short hymn to Shamash:
de-a da-a-a-in de-e-ni qe-reb apsi i-na-sal pa-nu-uk-ka
E. Ebeling, MVAG 23/125:9
Ea, the judge who gives judgements, sees your face inside the Apsu.
27 For Shamash Hymn 171-73, see W. Horowitz and S. Paul, NABU 1995 ll-12 no. 15. Cf. above, Lambert-Millard, Atra-basis 78 iii 25-30, and p. 308 here.
The Apsu 341
Apsu may also be found in the depths of the ocean in Gilg. XI, where Gilgamesh descends to the Apsu in search of the plant "Man becomes Young in Old Age":
271. When Gilgamesh heard this, he opened the walter-pipe] 272. He tied heavy stoners onto his feet] 273. They dragged him to the Aps[u ... 274. He took the plant and it pr[icked his hands.] 275. He untied the heavy stoners on his feet] 276. The sea deposited him on its shore. Thompson Gilg. XI 271-76 /1 CT 46 35 (see p. 105)
In this passage, Apsu may be the deep part of the sea, as in The Shamash Hymn, since Gilgamesh dives down into the sea, is dragged by the stones to the Apsu, and then returns to the seashore. A physical link between the Apsu and sea is also implied in the annals of Sennacherib, where the king presents offerings to Ea at the shore of the Persian Gulf (OIP 274:78-75:80).28 The Sumerian epic Enki and the World Order also preseves an association between the Apsu (engur) and the sea in a broken passage enumerating the duties of Nanse:
a.gi6.uru16.gal.la engur. [raj .ke4
i.zi.bu.lub.ba kur.ku ab.ba [ ... ] x [0"] zi.pa.ag.ta e.[a ... ] x in.nin.slrar[aki ama dnan]se a.ab.ba kionl.d[agal].la.ba den .ki.ke4 za.ba nam.mi.in.sa4

The Apsu and Deep Cosmic Waters
EWO 302-7
Three passages confirm that the Apsu included a deep region of waters far below the water table. In a bilingual fragment, the interior of the Apsu is said to be distant:
28 Compare the epithet of Ea in OIP 2 81:28-29 as quoted in CAD Nil 1092': bel nagbl kuppl u ta-ma!-a!-ti 'Lord of springs, fountains, and seas'.
29 The word zi.pa.ag is taken as a variant writing for za.pa.ag = rigmu.

The Apsu and the Underworld
Although no text explicitly places dead human beings in the Apsu, there is evidence that the Apsu and underworld were either confused with one another or that the Apsu itself was thought to be a netherworld inhabited by malevolent spirits. The clearest example of such confusion is found in The Incantation of Eridu in Utukku-Lemnutu XII, where EnkilEa resides in ganzer, a name for the underworld or gate to the underworld:
EN eriduki giS.kin ki.sikil.la mu.a

30 For further parallels, see Green Eridu 166-67; M. Civil, Aula Orientalis 5/1 20.
The Apsu 343
EnkilEa is also associated with the underworld river lJubur in Farber IStar und Dumuzi 137:179-82 (see p. 354) and perhaps also in a broken passage in The Shamash Hymn, where the Sun-god renders verdicts at the underworld lJubur River five lines after descending into the Apsu:

Further difficulties arise in texts that place underworld deities and demons in Apsu. In the god-list An = Anum, the deity dlugal.gal.abzu 'Great King of Apsu' is listed as a name of the underworld king Nergal (see RIA 7 138), while the Anunnaki reside in in Apsu instead of the underworld in The Erra Epic.31

Seven demons live in the nagab apsi 'spring of the Apsu' in parallel incantations in CT 16 15 v 30-36 and 1713:14 (see p. 346), and a disease causing convulsions (buru5 = dimitu) comes up from the Apsu in Surpu 36:1-2. In Ludlul
II 52-53, a "ghost" may even reside in the Apsu:
[uJl-te i-rat er$etimtim i-si-l;a #-co-i rsu-u1-lu lem-nu it-ta-$a-a ap-su-us-su
Ludlul II 52-53 (BWL 40; cf. BWL 53:5-6)
31 For a parallel in a cultic context where Marduk casts a spell against Enlil and consigns him to the Anunnaki, see SAA 3 93:3-4. Cf. SAA 3 94:32'-34'.



344 The Geography of Earth
[Frjom the surface of the underworld headache sprung up. An evil sulu came forth from the Apsu.
In the commentary to Ludlul, sulu is explained as etimmu 'ghost' (BWL 40). In Akkadian texts, etimmu are normally the ghosts of dead human beings, so the arrival of an etimmu from Apsu would indicate that some human ghosts resided in Apsu instead of the underworld, or that the Apsu was a/the underworld. However, it is possible that the commentary has misidentified sulu. Malku IV explains that sulu can mean saJalu 'cough' (see CAD S 1 saJalu lexical section). If so, a disease demon, rather than a departed human spirit, may exit from the Apsu in Ludlul. The apparent confusion or overlap between the Apsu and the underworld is probably based on empirical observation. It is logical to place both the Apsu and the underworld directly beneath the earth's surface. When one digs a well, one reaches the waters of Apsu without passing through the underworld, but graves of the dead are located above the groundwaters.32 Underworld rivers, such as Mesopotamian ijubur or Greek Styx, which souls must cross on their way to the underworld, probably represent the waters of the water table between graves and the realm of the dead further below.
The Geography of the Apsu
The various aspects of Apsu share a number of common elements. The Apsu is always filled with waters, the Apsu is always lower than the earth's surface, and waters identified with Apsu are found below the surface of rivers, seas, and other bodies of water. For example, groundwaters in the Apsu are located beneath the earth's surface, and Apsu waters in marshes, swamps, seas, and rivers are lower than the banks of these bodies of water. These common elements suggest that the Apsu can be thought of as a cosmic subterranean lake
that maintains a constant surface level. If so, it would be logical for the Apsu to form groundwaters below the earth's crust, where'the earth's surface is higher than the Apsu, but also possible for Apsu waters to seep into marshes, swamps, rivers, and the ocean, when the earth's crust dips below the level of the Apsu. Other deeper portions of the Apsu, of course, could be located beneath the hard floors of these bodies of water, just as groundwaters flow below the courses of rivers and canals. Nonetheless, it is clear that there were many different conflicting views of the Apsu in antiquity, and a few authors apparently ignore the existence of the Apsu altogether. For instance, Inanna and IStar reach the underworld in lnanna's Descent and The Descent of IStar without ever crossing the Apsu, and the lands float on a raft above the waters of the tamtu 'sea', instead of the Apsu, in The Bilingual Creation of the World by Marduk
32 For the Apsu mentioned in the context of excavating a grave in a broken context in Adapa and Enmerkar, see Picchioni Adapa 106:20.
The Apsu 345
The Top of the Apsu
In Old Babylonian Atra-l;asis and Gilg. XI, the flood heroes Atra-basis and Utnapistim are commanded to roof their arks like the Apsu:
[kji-ma ap-si-i su-a-ti $u-ul-li-il-si
a-ia+mu-ur dsamas qe-re-eb-sa lu-u su-ul-la-at e-li-is it sap-li-is
Lambert-Millard Atra-basis 88:29-31 (CT 46 pI. 13)
Roof it over like the Apsu.
Do not let the Sun look inside it. Let it be roofed at the front and the back.33
[lju-u mit-bur ru-pu-us-sa it mu-rak-sa [kji-ma apsf sa-a-si $u-ul-liHi
Let its width and length be equal. Roof it over like the Apsu.
Thompson Gilg. XI 30-31
If the roofed Apsu refers to the cosmic Apsu, then the earth's crust can be identified as Apsu's roof. Another reference to the roof of the Apsu may be found in fire incantations:
de-a ina te-e-ka ib-ba-ni a-me-lu-tu
tus-tas-ni-ma i-na as-rat ap-si-i titta (i m) -si-na tak-ri-i$
W. G. Lambert, AfO 23 43:25-26
Ea, by your spell mankind was created. You continued, pinched their clay from the hard surface of Apsu.
In this context, asrat can be understood as the construct state of the noun asartu 'hard ground', and asrat apsi may be the earth's surface over the Apsu.
The Floor of the Apsu
The only direct evidence for the floor of the Apsu is found in KAR 307, where the Apsu has a dannatu 'hard surface', just as the three heavens have stone floors, and the dannatu of the upper earth is the solid earth's surface where mankind dwells. In this context, the dannatu of Apsu must be the 'seafloor' of the Apsu and must separate the Apsu from the underworld.
33 For this understanding of elis and saplis, see A. Shaffer, RA 75 188-89. Note
also abzu.sa.dur.ra, perhaps 'the "rear part" (bottom) of Apsu', in Shulgi G (J. Klein, Fest. Tadmor 302:12, 307 n. 12).



346 The Geography of Earth
The Sides of the Apsu
In a bilingual incantation, EnkilEa tells his son Marduk that seven demons from the underworld, who wreak havoc on the earth's surface, once came to the sides of the Apsu:
7.bi kur.ta ba.bulug.ga.a.mes si-bit-ti-su-nu ina er-$e-ti ir-bu-u
da.da <e>.engur.ra.ke4 zukum.e ba.an.na.te.es i-da-at ap-si-i a-na ka-ba-su it-l:J,u-u~ni
The seven of them grew up in the underworld. They came near me to tread at the sides of Apsu.
CT 1645:134-37
This passage suggests that the demons passed the edge of the Apsu when they traveled from the underworld to the earth's surface. Thus it may have been possible to travel directly from the underworld to higher regions of the universe by
passing outside the borders of ApSU. 84
The Interior of the Apsu
There is almost no evidence concerning the interior of the Apsu. One might assume that the Apsu was completely filled with water, since the upper surface of the Apsu, in some contexts, is identified with ground waters. However, this hypothesis cannot be proved. Two features of the interior of the Apsu are known: the cella of EnkilEa and the 'spring of the Apsu' (idim.abzu = nagab apsi), which presumably supplied the Apsu with a never-ending source of waters. Seven demons inhabit the 'spring of the Apsu' in CT 17 13:14 and Utukku Lemnutu V (CT 16 15 v 30-36;
see p. 315). In the latter passage, the cella of the Apsu is located at this site: 85
idim.abzu.ta agrun.ta e.a.mes
ina na-gab ap-si-i ina ku-um-me ir-bu-u su-nu
CT 16 15 v 34-36
At the 'spring of the Apsu', in the cella, they grew up.
In Ee I 71-72, however, the cella of Ea is place eli apsi 'on Apsu'. Here Ea's cella may be located on the upper surface of the Apsu, just as Ea's cella in Eengurra is located above the marshes of Eridu in a hymn to Enki:
abzu kur me.nun.na du.a ki.sikil.la x [ ... ] sug.gal sug.mus la.a eriduki es [ .... ] A. Sj0berg, JCS 29 30 A obv. ii 7-8
34 Cf. Nergal and Ereskigal, where "The Stairway of Heaven" leads from the Heaven of Anu to the underworld, bypassing the earth's surface and Apsu (see p. 66).
35 See also F. Wiggermann, Natural Phenomena 295d.
The Apsu 347
Apsu, mountain built on princely mes, in a pure place. [ ... ] Great Marsh, extending over the 'snake'-marsh, Eridu, shrine [ .... ]86
The Depth of the Apsu
No figure is ever provided for the depth of the Apsu or the distance between the earth's surface and the underworld via the Apsu. Indirect evidence for this distance, however, may be found in the fragment CT 46 55 (see pp. 178-79), which states that er$etu is 1,432,000 leagues from asurrakku. If er$etu in this context is the earth's surface and asurrakku is here a name for the cosmic Apsu rather than the asurrakku of stars (see p. 179), then the distance from the earth's surface to the Apsu may be 1,432,000 leagues. However, the distance 1,432,000 leagues need not represent a straight line drawn from the earth's surface downward, and it is not possible to determine which point on earth and which part of the Apsu might be 1,432,000 leagues apart.37
The Gate of the Apsu in Ee V
In Ee V 73-76, Marduk places representations of the 11 creatures of Tiamat at the Gate of the Apsu as a reminder of his victory for future generations:
[ill riSl-ten eS-ret nab-nit-sa sa ti-amat ib-nu-u u-[x-x] [kak-k]i-su-un il:J,-te-pa-a i-sir se-pu-us-su
ib-ni-ma $al-mi-[su-nu [al:J,]-ra-tas la im-ma-saJ a
bab] ap-si-i u-sa-a$-[bit] si l-i lu it-tu
And the eleven creatures which Tiamat bore. [ .. ] Their [weapo]ns he broke and bound them at his feet.
Ee V 73-76
He made images [of them] and placed them at the [Gate] of Apsu (saying) "[So] that this will not be forgotten in the future, let it be a sign."
The images of the eleven creatures of Tiamat here at 'The Gate of Apsu' allude to the images of fantastic beings that decorated the Esagil at Babylon, which housed an Apsu-shrine. 38 Here in Ee V 73-76, one could argue that the 'Gate of Apsu' is a cosmic gate, since Esagil and Babylon are not built until Ee VI.
36 Cf. AHw 1115 [sug].mu[s] = $U$U 'canebrake, swamp'. 37 A second referepce to the depth of Apsu may be found in an obscure passage of the Amarna version of Sar TamlJari in the description of mountains on the way to Bursahanda: um-muq! 7 ZU?.AB bi-ra-su 'Its ... is 7 Apsus? deep?' (VS 12 193:29). Here um
muq might be construed as a nil stative from the root emequ with a western meaning 'to be deep', as in the standard Hebrew word for valley P1.):l) (Cemeq ). Thus the passage may explain that the height of the mountain peaks over the valley bottoms was seven times greater than the depth of the Apsu. 38 For the Apsu shrine of Esagil, see CAD A/2 196-97 c and George 300-303. For the Esagil and fantastic creatures, see p. 108.



348 The Geography of Earth
The Underworld
The underworld is the lowest region of the universe, the home of underworld deities such as Nergal and EreSkigal, and the final resting place of deceased humans. In KAR 307, the underworld is identified as the lowest of three earths, and 600 Anunnaki are shut inside. No text other than KAR 307 can confirm that the underworld was located below the Apsu, since only KAR 307 considers the relative locations of the the underworld, Apsu, and earth's surface together. Nonetheless, many texts do demonstrate that the underworld was lower than the earth's surface. For example, Ludlul II 46-47 states that people worry about descending to the underworld during times of distress: 39
ina ta-a-bi i-ta-ma-a i-li sd-ma-Ji u-tas-sd-sd-ma i-dab-bu-ba a-rad ir-kal-la
In good times people speak of going up to heaven.
BWL 40:46-47
Whey they become worried they mutter about going down to the underworld.
In contrast, no one is ever said to ascend to the underworld, and there is no evidence for any cosmic feature below the underworld.
The Creation of the Underworld
Very little information concerning the early history of the underworld has survived. The only known reference to the actual building of the underworld may be found in a short passage in Lugale where Ninurta builds urugal = qabrum from stone:
[u4].da.ta a.sag nam.ba.sa na4 mu.he he. [em]
[ a-a iq-qa]-bi ab-nu lu sum-su

[From now] on it will not be called asakku, stone will be its name. Zalaqu-stone will be its name, stone will be its name. Its body will be the underworld (Akk.: of the grave).
If urugal = qabru is taken as a name for the underworld, rather than a simple noun meaning 'grave', Lugale reveals that the underworld was fash

The Underworld 349
ioned from the stone corpse of the asakku-demon.4o This tradition can be compared to Ee IV 147-56, where Marduk fashions the heavens from the watery corpse of Tiamat. The Sumerian epic Gilgamesh and the IJuluppu-Tree offers a second tradition. In CHT 8-13, the daughter of Enlil, Ereskigal, receives the underworld (kur) as a gift, after heaven (an) and earth (ki) are carried away by Anu and Enlil and mankind is created (see p. 135). Here the underworld is apparently a part of earth (k i) that is assigned to Ereskigal.
The Geography of the Underworld
Despite the numerous references to the underworld and the large number of names for the region (see chapter 12), little is known about the geography or interior of the underworld. Most of the available information concerns the approaches to the underworld, including a road that leads to the underworld, a river that flows at the entrance to the underworld, and the gates that lead into the underworld.
The Interior of the Underworld
Descriptions of the interior of the underworld and its inhabitants are found in a few literary texts. One nearly identical description is repeated in Cilg. VII, Nergal and EreSkigal, and The Descent of !Star, where the description is best preserved:
4. a-na bit e-te-e su-bat dir-[kal-la] 5. a-na bit sa e-re-bu-su la a-$u-[u] 6. a-na har-ra-ni sa a-lak-ta-sd la ta-a-a-[rat] 7. a-na biti sa e-re-bu-su zu-um-mu-u nu-[u-ra] 8. a-sar epru(sahar)ll'i bu-bu-us-su-nu a-kal-Su-nu ti-i[t-ta] 9. nu-u-ru ul im-ma-ru ina e-tu-ti ds-[bu-u] 10. lab-su-ma k'ima i$-$u-ri $u-bat kap-[pi-i] 11. eli gisdalti u gissikkuri(sag.gul) sd-pu-ul; ep-ru

p.294). For a parallel to Lugale 327-29, see W. G. Lambert, JNES 48 216-18. For a different interpretation of these lines, see W. Heimpel, JNES 46 310; Jacobsen Harps 251, Sachs Mem. VoL 230-31.



350 The Geography of Earth
In The Descent of IStar and Nergal and Ereskigal, the narrator provides the descriptions of the underworld, but in Gilg. VII, Enkidu describes the underworld after a nightmare in which he sees residents of the underworld, including Etana and Ereskigal (Gilg. VII iv 48-51).41 Three other literary works offer accounts of conditions inside the underworld. In The Death of Ur-Nammu (S. N. Kramer, JCS 21 104-22), the ghost of Ur-Nammu pays courtesy calls to the underworld palaces (e.gal) of various underworld gods, including Nergal, EreSkigal, and Dumuzi, soon after his death. In Gilgamesh and the ljuluppu-Tree and the parallel portion of Gilg. XII, Enkidu describes the ultimate fates of various categories of humans in the underworld (Shaffer Sumerian Sources pp. 86-95). Many of the underworld gods themselves are described in The Underworld Vision of an Akkadian Crown Prince (SM 3 68-76). For instance, the gatekeeper Bidu is said to have the head of a lion, human hands, and feet of a bird (SM 372:7).42
Features of the Interior of the Underworld
Almost all known features of the underworld are architectural rather than topographical. In The Death of Ur-Nammu, the deceased Ur III king visits the palaces (e.gal) of Nergal, Gilgamesh, Ereskigal, Dumuzi, Husbisa, Ningiszida, Dimpimeku, and Ninazimua, bringing gifts OCS 21 114:89-115:127) before acquiring his own underworld home:
ur.dnammu bara.gal.kur.ra.ke4 mu.ni.ib.tus.u.ne
kur.ra ki.tus?ni mu.na.ga.ga.ne S. N. Kramer, JCS 21 115:135-36 (collated)// (PSD B 139 bara l.8.4)
Ur-Nammu they seated by the great dais of the underworld. In the underworld, they established his abode? for him.
In Descent of Btar 111-17, Ereskigal orders Namtar to summon the Anunnaki from the underworld palace e.gal.gi.na, and Anunnaki may even live in an underworld temple tower in a funerary text from Elam:
aHa lu-li-ka Hi be-li a-na ma-al:J-rPtil e-nu-na-ki 'lu'-ti-iq g[i4?-g]un4?-na
Come, let me go, my god, my lord, into the presence of the Anunnaki. Let me pass the t[emple-to]wer?43

The Underworld 351
In the Sultantepe and late versions of Nergal and Erdkigal, Ereskigal holds court in an underworld courtyard (kisallu) (STT 28 vi 29; SpTU I 1 iv 3). In the Amarna version, Ereskigal sits in a temple/house:
i-na li-ib-bi bi-i-ti i$-$a-ba-at e-re-d-ki-i-gal i-na sa-ar-ti-sa u-qi-id-di-da-a-as-si-im-ma is-tu ku-us-si-i
C. Bezold, The Tell-el-Amarna Tablets 82 rev. 29-30 (EA 357:77-78)
Inside the temple/house he seized Ereskigal. By her hair, he pulled her down from her throne.
The presence of palaces, a house/temple, a courtyard, and perhaps even a temple-tower in the underworld demonstrates that the region was conceived as a great temple complex. In some traditions, this temple complex may have represented the entire underworld. However, it is more likely that the underworld was thought to be a complete underground city. The term urugallerigal 'Great City' was a popular Sumerian name for the underworld (see pp. 293-94), and it is difficult to imagine all the generations of mankind living in a temple complex alongside the underworld gods. Most probably, ordinary deceased people were thought to dwell outside the temple complex of the underworld, just as they did not reside in palaces and temples during their lifetimes on the earth's surface. Nevertheless, important deceased humans, such as Gilgamesh, Etana, and Dumuzi, resided with the gods in the underworld and even became underworld gods themselves. Etana is found in the underworld along with Ereskigal in Gilg. VII iv 49-50, and both Gilgamesh and Dumuzi, as well as Nergal and Ereskigal, have underworld palaces in The Death of Ur-Nammu.
Topographic Features
The only possible evidence for topographical features in the underworld is found in a passage from Damu in the Underworld, where underworld rivers, fields, and sheep are very different from those on the earth's surface:

352 The Geography of Earth
Underworld Darkness
The names of the underworld kukku/kukku 'Darkness' (see pp. 289-90) and 'House of Darkness' in Gilgames, The Descent of IStar, and Nergal and Ereskigal (see p. 349) demonstrate that the underworld was a dark place. This darkness is explained in an Akkadian medical incantation and an excerpt from The Descent of IStar. The medical incantation states that no fires or lights illuminated the underworld:
... J x ina e-re-bi-su ana bit e-ti-i sa isata(izi) u nura(zalag) la immaru(n u.igi.d us) erib(ku4)-SU
AMT 88 2:3
... J . when he enters into the 'House of Darkness' whose enterer sees neither fire nor light.
The Descent of IStar explains that no stars shine in the underworld:
(bi)-it ek-le-tu kakkabu(m ul) ul u-sa-a
LKA 62 rev. 17
House of Darkness, where a star does not come out.
Additional references to the underworld darkness are found in Surpu 48:10710 (see p. 281) and a passage from The Death of Gilgamesh:
rdl[ ... J.tur/dumu du tu.ke4 kur.ra ki.kukku.ka U4 bu.mu.na.an.ga.ga

Let ... [ ... J the ... I son of Utu,45 in the underworld, the place of darkness, set up a light for him.
These passages, however, may not mean that the underworld is always bereft of light. In a number of passages, the Sun-god passes through the underworld at night on his way under the earth's surface from the western horizon to the eastern horizon. For example, Shamash Hymn 31 (BWL 126) places the Sun-god in the underworld alongside the underworld malku, kusu, and Anunnaki-gods. A Sumerian literary work explicitly states that the Sun-god Utu illuminates the underworld before offering judgment in the underworld: 46
45 For this passage, compare R. Borger, AOAT 1 10:175; M. Geller ZA 73 114:6, where Utu/Shamash's son is the flame (nablu). For sons of Utu, see Deimel Pantheon 252-53.
46 The epithets of Shamash, dajan same u er$eti 'Judge of Heaven and Earth', dajan eliiti u saplati 'Judge of Upper and Lower Regions', and dajan digigi u danunnaki 'Judge of the Igigi and Anunnaki', also imply that the Sun-god rendered judgments in the underworld (see also Tallqvist Gotterepitheta 79-80; CAD D 32 3'). For the Sun-god at night in the underworld, see also W. Heimpel, JCS 38 146-51. For Utu as an underworld judge, see B. Alster, ASJ 1327-32. For the Moon-god and Sun-god as judges in the underworld, see Livingstone 42. The name of the underworld god in the funerary texts from Elam MDP 18 251:4, 252:7, mu-se-KI-li-im may be read musekilum 'He who makes darkness' or museqqilum 'He who weighs (judgments), (see M. Leibovici, RTCA 2 41-42).

The Approaches to the Underworld
The most commonly attested route to the underworld followed a road from the earth's surface to the underworld gates or the banks of a river that flowed by the entrance to the underworld. All humans passed this way after death. This road is often called 'The Road of No Return', since humans who traveled along the road could never return to life on the earth's surface, as is explained in The Gilgamesh Epic and Descent of IStar:
a-na l:Jarrani sa a-lak-ta-sa la ta-a-a-rat
Thompson Gilg. VII iv 35, CT 15 45:6
to the road whose journey has no return.
Gods, demons, and ghosts had alternate routes to the underworld. They could travel along the simmilat samami 'Stairway of Heaven', which leads directly from the gates of heaven to the gates of the underworld in Nergal and EreSkigal, or they could spring up from the underworld through cracks in the earth's surface like the spirit of Enkidu in GHT 242-43 = Gilg. XII 83-84 or plants that pierce the earth's crust.
The Road to the Underworld
Although the road to the underworld is mentioned in numerous texts, its exact route is never explained, and the terminus of the road varies. In some instances, the road leads directly to the underworld gates, while elsewhere, the road ends at the underworld river which must then be crossed. The only known itinerary of a journey to the underworld from a Mesopotamian city is found in Inanna's Descent, where Inanna journeys from her city Uruk to the underworld. Her route follows the Iturungal Canal upstream from Uruk to Bad Tibira, Zabalam, and Adab, and then continues northward to Nippur, Kish, and finally Akkad (ID 7-13).47 From Akkad, the goddess proceeds directly to the gates of the underworld without crossing the ljubur River. When she arrives at the gates, she is challenged by Bidu, the gatekeeper of the underworld, to explain her presence. She answers that she is traveling eastward to the 'Place of Sunrise', presumably to rise as the morning star Venus, since she identifies herself as the 'Lady of Heaven':
47 For the Iturungal Canal, see RGTC 2 271. The route of Inanna along the canal is
examined in Sladek ID 61-63 and G. Buccellati, SMS 4/3 3-5, where Inanna's journey is explained as a litual journey to Kutha. This proposal must be reconsidered in light of
C. Wall-Romema's identification of Tell Muhammad near Baghdad as the site of Akkad (see JNES 49 243-45). .



354 The Geography of Earth
me.e dga.sa.an.na kLdutu.e.a.as Sladek ID 113:81
I am the Lady of Heaven (going) towards the 'Place of Sunrise'
Bidu is not satisfied with her answer:
tukum.bi za.e dinanna ki.dutu.e.a.as a.na.am ba.du.un kur.nu.gi4.se ba.ra.an lu.du.be nu.gi4.gi4.de sa.zu a.gim tum.mu.un
Sladek ID 113:82-84
If you are Inanna (going) to the 'Place of Sunrise', why have you come to the 'Earth of No Return'? What made you decide to take the path whose traveler never returns.
Inanna then uses the excuse that she has come to attend the funeral of her brother-in-law Gugalanna in order to gain entry to the underworld. Inanna's need to excuse her presence at the gate suggests that Inanna has not followed her normal course eastward to the 'Place of Sunrise' and that she is lying to Bidu when she tells him she has traveled eastward to the gates. Thus, it cannot be certain that Inanna has traveled eastward to the underworld. Although Inanna does not cross an underworld river during her trip to the underworld, there is evidence elsewhere for a river lying at the end of the road. For instance, The Babylonian Theodicy states that the destiny of all mankind is to follow a road to the underworld River ljubur:
na-a[d]-nu-ma ab-bu-nu na-'a'-ri l]u-bur ib-bi-ri
il-la-ku qa-bu-u
u-ru-ul] mu-u-t[u] ul-tu ul-la
BWL 70:16-17
Our fathers gave in, traveled the road of death. "They crossed the river ljubur;' as the old saying goes.
Similarly, Dumuzi travels along a road to the ljubur River, bearing the sin of a supplicant in an incantation:
e-nu-ma tal-la-ku u-ru-ul]-ka lem-nu sul]4-l]ir-su-ma pa-nu-us-ka liZ-lik e-nu-ma te-eb-be-ru ldl]u-bur

W. Farber !Star und Dumuzi 137:179-82 (cf. 186:51-54)
When you go on your road, turn the evil away, let it go before you. When you cross the ljubur, exorcise it by Ea so that it will not come back.
In a bilingual parallel, this road is identified as the 'Road of No Return':

In a broken passage from The Death of Ur-Nammu, after death the Sumerian king travels along a road in a chariot to the underworld gates:

[At the ... of the underwo]rld he arrived. It was empty. . [ .. ], the chariot fell down. The road became disordered. He could
not proceed.4s The gatekeeper. [(.)], the chariot fell down. The road became disordered. He could not proceed. My king gave the seven [ . (..) ] of the underworld an offering.
Here, the seven gods who receive offerings are presumably the seven gatekeepers of the underworld. In Inanna's Descent and The Descent of IStar, the goddess is required to give each of the seven gatekeepers an article of clothing. The chariot that Ur-Nammu rides to the underworld in The Death of Ur-Nammu may be compared with the vehicles excavated by Woolley in the "Royal Graves of Ur."
The River of the Underworld
A number of Sumerian and Akkadian texts speak of a river flowing at the entrance to the underworld. 49 In Sumerian texts, this river is not identified by name, but many Akkadian texts call the river the ljubur.
The Location of the River. The relative position of the underworld river, road, and gates is not explained in any single text. In The Babylonian Theodicy
48 For su - nigin meaning 'to proceed along a road', note parallels in Klein Shulgi 198:76 and Enmerkar and Ensuhkesdanna 44:88. 49 For the underworld riv;r and cosmic waters, see also T. Fymer-Kensky, The Judicial Ordeal in the Ancient Near East (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 1977) 587-604.



356 The Geography of Earth
(BWL 70:16-17) and Farber IStar und Dumuzi 137:179-82, the river seems to be located at the end of the road to the underworld. Here one might suppose that the river flows before the gates. This idea finds support in the phrase i d da.da kur.ra. ka 'river at the sides of the underworld' in Damu in the Underworld (Y. Scheil, RA 8 170 rev. 1). If so, new arrivals at the underworld would have been ferried across the tJubur, just as the boatman Charon ferries the dead across the Styx to Hades in Greek mythology. A similar Mesopotamian boatman is described in Underworld Vision 45:
dl;u-mut-ta-bal1limalal;(ma.lalh) er$ctimtim qaqqadu an-zumusen
4 qatil II se[pa II ...
SAA. 3 71 no. 32 rev. 5
Humuttabal, the boatman of the underworld, with the head of an Anzu-bird, four hands and fe[et ...
In a few texts, however, the underworld river need not necessarily flow outside the entire series of gates. In LKA 90, the tJubur is mentioned between a gatecomplex belonging to the Anunnaki and the "Gate of the Captives;' indicating
that the tJubur may flow within the series of gates: 50

A parallel is found in An Address of Marduk to the Demons E 23-32, where the gates of the underworld are mentioned before the na:Jilu sa er$etim rapastim 'stream of the Vast Earth':

357
The above passage apparently describes the process by which a demon is banished to the underworld. First, the demon is handed over to the underworld. Then he is admitted through the seven gates of the underworld by the gatekeepers of Ereskigal and by Namtar, who escorts him through the "Gate of the Captives." At this point, the newcomer is passed to the galla-demons, who may hold him while Bidu locks the gates. Ningiszida then takes charge of him and passes him on to the Anunnaki in the interior of the underworld. In this passage, the underworld stream is not mentioned until the demon reaches the home of Allati, well within the underworld gates.
The Course of the Underworld River. There is no information concerning the source, outlet, or course of the river other than the passage in Damu in the Underworld, where the river is said to flow at the sides of the underworld (see p. 356). Therefore, it cannot be proved that the river circumambulated the underworld. The source of the waters of the river remains a mystery, since the underworld itself is a dry region.
The Size of the Underworld River. There are two conflicting traditions concerning the nature of the river. In Damu in the Underworld, waters do not flow in the river of the underworld (see p. 351), suggesting that this underworld river may be a stagnant stream, like small waterways on the earth's surface during the dry season, or perhaps even a dry river bed. In contrast, passages from a hymn to Lugalgirra and Meslamtaea and An Address of Marduk to the Demons describe the underworld river as a great river:
51 For dallatu as a name for Ereskigal, see AfK 2 73:23 (p. 289); CT 25 4:24, 8:8; Ugaritica 5 55-56.

The Gates of the Underworld
The best-known feature of the underworld is its gates. These gates lead from the approaches to the underworld into the interior of the region. In a number of texts, the underworld is reached through a series of seven gates. The clearest explanation of the configuration of these gates is found in [nanna's Descent, when Ereskigal instructs Bidu, the gatekeeper of the underworld, on how to admit Inanna to her realm:
ka.gal.kur.ra 7.bi gissi.gar.bi be.eb.us e.gal.ganzer dili.bi gisig.bi su ba.ba.an.uSsladek ID 118:119-20
Let the bolts of the gate of the underworld, the seven of them, be set
down. Let the doors of the underworld palace be opened individually.
In this passage, all seven gates are located in e.gal.ganzer, demonstrating that these gates belong to a single gate complex rather than seven separate gate complexes in seven concentric walls, or seven gates spread along the circumfer
ence of the underworld. Other examples of the seven gates and gatekeepers of the underworld include An Address of Marduk to the Demons E 24 (see p. 356); passages in Nergal and Ereskigal, where the gates are listed with the names of their keepers;52 KAR 142 rev. iv 12-15, which lists seven gatekeepers of Ereskigal; and two zi.pa-formulas from Utukku-Lemnutu V that invoke the seven doors and locks of the gates:
zi gisig.kur.ra 7.bi be
nis da-[lat er?etim 7 su-nu MIN]
zi giSsahab(su'ms).kur.ra 7.bi be CT 16 13:46-48
52 STT 28 i 20'-26', iii 41'-47', vi 19'-28' (see AnSt 10 108-26); SpTU I 1 iii 13'iv 3. For the El-Amarna parallel EA 357:47-50, 67-74, see below.
The Underworld
Be exorcised by the seven doors of the underworld. Be exorcised by the seven locks of the underworld.
359
In the Amarna version of Nergal and Ereskigal, 14 gatekeepers are listed (EA 357:67-74), but these 14 gatekeepers probably guard seven gates, with two portals and two gatekeepers to each gate. Likewise, gates to the underworld such as ka.gal ganzer in GHT 167, and bab dereskigal 'The Gate of Ereskigal' in Nergal and Ereskigal (STT 28 vi 19'; EA 357:51-52) can be gate complexes with multiple gates. In ID 74-75, the entrance to the underworld is identified as ka.gal.kur.ra 'Gate of the Underworld'. Only later in ID 119-20 do we learn that ka.gal.kur.ra is in fact a gate-complex with seven gates. The underworld gates, like those of heaven (see pp. 265-67), were identical in structure to city gates on the earth's surface. These gates consisted of many gate parts, including doors, door frames, bolts, locks, and keys. For example, the door and locks of the underworld gates are mentioned in CT 16 13 46-48 (see above); ID 74, 120, and 126 refer to an underworld door; Descent of !Star 17-18 (CT 15 45) speaks of the door, bolt, and door frame (sippu) of the underworld; and KAR 267 II BMS 53 (J. Scurlock, JAOS 108 207:22-23) refers to the key that opens the lock of the underworld gate. Bit Meseri II 128 refers to a door and a lock guarded by Bidu:
ilanumes ka-mu-tu lil-qu-su dbi-dus 'i-dus-gal sa er?etimtim pa-nu-us-su li-iz-ziz
it, gisdaltu /:}ar-gul-li-su li-i?-bat
G. Meier, AfO 14 146:126-28
Let the captive gods take it (all evil). Let Bidu, the chief gatekeeper of the underworld, stand before it, and let the door hold fast its lock.
This gate may be identified as the bab kamuti 'Gate of the Captives', which occurs in LKA 90 (TuL p. 128) and in An Address of Marduk to the Demons E 25 (AfO 19 117; see pp. 356-57), where the 'Gate of the Captives' is mentioned after the seven gatekeepers of Ereskigal. The 'Gate of the Captives' was presumably among the inner gates of the underworld, if not the innermost gate, since it would not have been prudent to allow captive gods to approach the exit from the underworld. 53
The Stairway of Heaven
Two texts refer to stairways leading to the underworld. In the Sultantepe version of Nergal and EreSkigaZ the simmilat Samaml 'Stairway of Heaven' leads from the Gate of Anu, Enlil, and Ea in the heavens to the Gate of Erdkigal at the entrance to the underworld, bypassing the earth's surface, Apsu, and
53 For the 'Gate of the Captives', see n. 50 above. Note also the 'Gate of Sunset' and
Nergal in a broken context in SpTU 3 64 iv 17-26 + dupL (see p. 280), and CT 58 p. 19
no. 43 for the Moon-god and underworld doors.



360 The Geography of Earth
]jubur River (see p. 60). In a Nabopolassar inscription (F. A1-Rawi, Iraq 474:15) simmelat ganzer 'Stairway of the Underworld' occurs as an epithet of the wall
of Babylon Imgur-Enlil. A possible parallel to these two passages may be found in The Duties and Powers of the Gods:
... dnerigal.ra kun.sag.kur.ra ki da.nun.na.ke4.ne te.ga en. 1 nln. 1. 1 ...
d 1'1 fdl . [1'1 b' Sumer 4 pi. IV iv 27'-37'
... forNergal, the 'stairway'? of the underworld, where the Anunnaki draw near, Enlil and Nin[lil ...
Nabnitu VII 287 (MSL 16 U3) lists kun.sag as an equivalent of simmiltu sa gigune'stairway of a temple-tower'.
Cracks in the Earth's Surface
Demons and ghosts could pass vertically from the underworld directly to the earth's surface through openings in the earth without using the underworld gates. In GHT 242-43 = Gilg. XII 82-83, the ghost of Enkidu issues out of the
underworld through a hole and speaks to Gilgamesh in Uruk: 54
ab.lal kur.ra gal im.ma.an.tag4 si.si.ig.ta subur.a.ni kur.ta mu.ni.in.ell·de GHT 242-43 (Shaffer Sumerian Sources 85-86)
(Gilgamesh) opened a hole in the underworld. As a ghost, his servant (Enkidu) came up from the underworld.
lu-man tak-ka-ap erlletimtim ip-te-e-ma
u-tuk-ku sa den-ki-du ki-i za-qi-qi ul-tu er$etimtim f it-ta51-$a-a
Thompson Gilg. XII 83-84
Now, when (Gilgamesh) opened a hole in the underworld, the ghost of Enkidu came forth from the underworld as a ghost.
Underworld demons also seem to be able to pass through openings in the earth's surface. In a bilingual incantation, seven demons reside in a crack in the underworld:
ki.in.dar kur.ra.ke4durun.na.a.mes
ina ni-gi-i$-$i er-$e-ti it-ta-na-as-sa-hu CT 1644:88-89 (cf. 102-3)
In the crack of the underworld they are dwelling.
54 K Szarzynska (Akkadica 23 45-49) suggests that this literary opening to the un
derworld is to be identified with the "Steingebaude" of Archaic Uruk. Note also A Koefoed, ASJ 5 17-23.
The Underworld 361
Similarly, a zLpa tablet lists ki.in.dar urugal.la = nigi$ er$eti 'crack of the underworld' as a haunt of demons (Fest. von Soden 10 no. 21 185). In Surpu, a demon even pierces his own opening in the earth's crust like a sprouting plant:
du.du u.sim.gim ki.a mu.un.dar
aJ;-J;a-zu ki-ma ur-qe-ti er-$e-ta i-pe-$[i]/ipe$$a
Surpu 36:5-6+dupl. (see CAD All 185)
The jaundice-demon is breaking through the ground like a plant.
Such openings in the earth's crust allowing contact between the earth's surface and the underworld below can be compared with clay pipes (arutu) that were placed in the earth as conduits for libations to the dead (see CAD A/2 324; AS] 13 86 n. 131).
Mountains
It may have been possible to enter the underworld by crossing distant mountains. In The Death of Gilgamesh, 'climbing the mountain' may be used as a euphemism for dying:
hur.sag ell.de.de ba.nu ur5 nu.mu.e.[da.an.zi.zi]
giSnu.nam.tar.ra.ka ba.nu ur5 nu.mu.e.da.an.zi.zi
S. N. Kramer, BASOR 947:67-68
He (?ilgamesh) lies 'climbing the mountain', he cannot [raise himself up.] He lIes on the bed of destiny, he cannot raise himself up.
The king of the underworld, Nergal, is associated with a mountain of sunrise in
SGL II 37:46.55
The Size and Shape of the Underworld
There is very little evidence for the size and shape of the underworld. T~e names of the underworld kur.gal, kur.dagal, ki.gal, ki.dagal, urugal, k1gall u, er$etu rahuu, and er$etu rapastu all demonstrate that the underworld was very large, but no text ever measures the dimensions of the region. The only known evidence for the shape of the underworld is found in the epithet of Enmesarra $iihit kippat kigalli 'Holder of the Circle of the Underworld' (R. Borger, ZA 61 77:48). If 'circle' in this context can be taken literally, then this epithet reveals that the underworld, like the heavens and earth's surface, was circular in shape.

362 The Geography of Earth
The Depth of the Underworld
The only evidence for an exact distance between the underworld and a higher region is found in Erra I 152, where a cosmic mesu-tree is said to descend 100 leagues through the tamtu rapastu 'vast sea' to the depth of the underworld (see p. 245). Thus, the interior of the underworld must be at least 100 leagues below sea-level in this passage. Late Babylonian building inscriptions, where foundations are placed at the irtu 'edge' of the underworld,56 imply that the underworld was much closer. However, as Gilgamesh and Enkidu learned when they tried to retrieve their fallen instruments in GHT 164-67, it was not possible for humans to reach down into the underworld.
