PROLOGUE
The rough road of Hungarian Ancient History
Hungarian Ancient History deals with that period of the national past
which begins around 3000 B.C. and ends in 895 A.D. when the last
Magyar ethnic wave arrived and settled in the Carpathian basin. This
delimitation is mainly based upon a longstanding tradition, but is
justified by methodological considerations as well. Indeed, in the
elaboration of ancient history, the so-called subsidiary studies of
History play a considerably greater role than in more recent periods,
on account of the scarcity of written documents, which are the usual
sources of historical knowledge. The most helpful of such subsidiary
studies are, first, linguistics and archaelogy, then mythology and
paleography, to which most recently, the science of place-names or
toponymy was added. This many-sided approach renders the task of
the historians more difficult. The importance of their researches is
however great, since the results have a strong bearing upon the
national consciousness. Because of this, Ancient History is usually
exposed to strong political interferences.
1. When modern historiography was born, in the middle of the XlXth
century, Hungarian scholars found themselves before a difficult
alternative: they had to adopt either the Finno-Ugrian conception of
their past or the Orientalist conception. The foundation of the Finno
Ugrian or "Uralian" conception was laid down by Swedish, German
and Russian scholars, and in particular, by August Ludwig Schloezer,
professor at Goettingen University, Germany. Its basic thesis was the
linguistic and ethnic kinship of Hungarians with Finns and Esthonians
living in the Baltic area, and with the Uralian peoples in the Volga
Ural region. The holder of this theory placed the original homeland of
the Finno-Ugrians in the vast Siberian plain. This theory was
welcomed and strongly supported for political reasons by the



Habsburg dynasty, which was anxious, after the tragic events of 1849,
to curb Hungarian influence in the Double Monarchy just then, by
injecting the leaders of that nation with an inferiority complex. They
first sent Miklosits, the professor of slavistics at Vienna University, to
Budapest, to supervise the program of the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences. Miklosits had understood the point of his mission and
prepared a long list of words which were all "borrowed" from the
Slavonic languages, according to him. After Miklosits, a German
scholar was sent to Budapest, J. Budenz (1836-1892), who became,
with his companion Pál Hunfalvy (Hunsdorfer, 1810-1891), the main
architect of the Finno-Ugrian conception of Hungary's ancient history.
The two pioneers proclaimed that the Hungarian people and the
Hungarian language were of Finno-Ugrian origin, consequently, their
original common homeland could not have been situated anywhere
else than in the Uralo-Siberian region. They also found that the early
Hungarians stood, in respect to civilization, on the lowest step of
evolution: they were forest-dwelling nomads, living on the mere
product of Nature, eating mushrooms, berries, digging up roots,
fishing and hunting. As such, they were ignorant of the fundamental
achievements of Higher Civilization: stockbreeding and
foodproduction by farming. In short, the early Hungarians were
depicted as a backward populace, in a state of semi-savagery, whose
later civilization developed entirely from constant borrowings, first
from the Turkish peoples, thereafter from Slavs, Germans and Latins,
who were their teachers and instructors.
The second conception of Hungarian ancient history linked the
Hungarian language to the oldest one of mankind, viz. the Sumerian,
and placed the original home of the Nation in the Ancient Near East,
between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (Sumer and Babylon). This
conception was also first outlined by Western scholars, namely by A.H.
Sayce, J. Oppert, F. Lenormant and C. Rawlinson.



From a Hungarian point of view, the most important finding of the
West-European sumerologists was the discovery that the Sumerian
language was neither Semitic nor Indo-European in structure, but
agglutinative, like the Hungarian. The far-reaching significance of this
statement was obvious, because speakers of this early agglutinative
language were the authors of the first Higher Civilization of mankind.
A. H. Sayce summed up this thesis as follows: "The earliest civilized
inhabitants of Babylonia did not speak a Semitic language and
therefore they were not Semites... Eastward of Sumer, the type of
language was thus agglutinative, as it was in Sumer itself. And in the
days when civilization first grew up there, there is no sign or trace of
the language we call inflectional... Babylonian culture owed its origin
to a race whose type of language was that of the Finns, of the Magyars
or the Japanese" (P 112 pp. 70-72). The same opinion was upheld by
all later sumerologists, including Prof. Woolley, who writes in the most
recent UNESCO manual: "Sumerian was unique amongst the
languages of the Ancient Near East in being agglutinative; it belonged
in this respect, to the same group as... Finnish and Hungarian (P 064
p. 635). Western scholars also stated that there was a steady outflow
of Sumerian population towards Europe beginning the New Stone
Age, and that they had introduced the Higher Civilization to almost all
regions of Europe, including distant Britain. In short, this conception
places Early Hungarians into a considerably higher historical status.
After the above mentioned discoveries, it became increasingly exciting
for Hungarian scientists to find out the true ethnic and linguistic
identity of the ancient Near-Easterners: Mesopotamians, Egyptians,
and Anatolians. It was indeed hoped that the solution of this enigma,
with the help of the Hungarian clue, might lead us to a global re
evaluation of the origin and affiliation of all European peoples and, in
particular, to a re-evaluation of the place of Hungarians amongst
them. A formidable challenge was thus awaiting Hungarian scholarship.



2. It seems incredible, but the fact is that Hungarians were not
encouraged to take part in these researches; on the contrary, they had
been removed from the field of sumerology and egyptology, and
redirected towards the Uralo-Siberian wildernesses. The new
Orientalist researches had already produced decisive results which
were going to alter the traditional Semitic image of the region in
question. In fact, they discovered that the myth of the Creation, the
story of the Flood, and the many hymns and parables recorded in the
Old Testament, were not the literary invention of Semitic Genius, as it
was believed until then, but that of the previous agglutinative
speaking peoples, from whom they were simply taken over. Therefore,
to avoid further erosion of the Semitic Miracle, it seemed appropriate
to divert all the potentially dangerous elements from the field of
researches. The chief instigator of this militant policy was Joseph
Halévy (1827-1917), a Jewish-born Rumanian, who managed to
become professor at the Sorbonne in Paris. Actually, he had waged a
lifelong battle to maintain the antiquated belief, namely, emphasizing
the exclusively Semitic character of the Ancient Near East, where no
other race was ever present, according to him. At the Orientalist
Congress in Paris (1901), Halévy encountered Hungary's delegate,
Ignac Goldziher (1850-1921), who had a seat in the governing body
of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and was, at the same time,
general-manager of the Jewish Religious Community of Budapest for
many years. So he was quick to understand Halévy's concern and,
back in Budapest, emphatically declared that Hungarian scholars were
wasting their time searching for their ancestors in the Ancient Near
East, it being a purely Semitic area. And Bernát Munkácsy (Munk),
another Hungarian educated orientalist, also member of the Academy
of Sciences and school-inspector at the Jewish Religious Community
of Budapest, submitted his "expert's report" to the Academy, wherein
declared "in good faith" that: "It is out of question... that we may
envisage any closer relation between the Sumerian and the Hungarian



languages. Therefore Hungarian scientists cannot rightly claim any
part of the brilliant Sumerian heritage, nor can they take any credit
from the Sumerians' merits, under the pretext that they were their
ancestors. If anyone would, nevertheless, do so, he would make
himself ridiculous" (P 051 p. 55).
After that, the Academy systematically sabotaged Sumerian studies in
Hungary. It had refused to receive Zsófia Torma, the lady who wished
to report on her epoch-making finding, that in Neolithic times there
were close contacts between Hungary and ancient Mesopotamia.
Professor Zsigmond Varga, another outstanding orientalist, who
established several linguistic parallels between Hungarian and
Sumerian in his imposing volume "At a distance of 5,000 years"
(Debrecen 1942), was judged by his critics as an "impostor, charlatan,
confused and unscientific." A third scholar, Vilmos Hevesy (alias F.A.
Uxbond), who discovered the ancient links between Hungarians and
Indians (P 130), was also rejected, because his findings disagreed with
the official Uralo-Siberian doctrine. Many other similar cases are
known, but let us recall only one, that of Flórián Mátyás. This scholar,
in his inaugural address at the Academy (1859), talked, to no avail,
about the deciphering of hieroglyphs; he was unable to capture the
attention of Pál Hunfalvy, who simply laughed it off. It was not until a
great, independent, international authority, Prof. G. Childe, stated in
his fundamental work on the Danubian Neolithic and Bronze Ages (P
031), that scholars all over the world agreed that the Early
Hungarians had a respectable share in the heritage of the Ancient
Near East. Thus ended the stormy, first period of the modern researches
on the origin of Hungarians, wherein the imposed Uralian conception
seemed to prevail, to the detriment of the free researches.
3. After 1945 this situation totally changed, when swarms of
intellectuals left Hungary, following the communist take-over. These
exiles, free of any political pressure, once they were settled in the free



world, have undertaken the renewal of the ancient Hungarian history
in an Oriental light. Ida Bobula (USA, 1900-1981) was the first to
perceive their new mission. She took up research where Prof. Varga
left off in 1942 and was indefatigable in arousing interest for the
arduous task. In his time, Prof. Varga was mainly dealing with
grammatical parallels between Sumerian and Hungarian. As regards
the vocabulary, however, he was unable to find more than about 80
common words. Consequently, Ida Bobula, focussed her efforts upon
the enlargement of the vocabulary concordances and was
instrumental in completing the existing list with over a thousand
additional common words, amongst them the important one for 'God',
Isten in both languages. With her work, she firmly established the
Sumero-Hungarian kinship as a scientifically proven fact and summed
up her results in an English language study, Sumerian affiliations (P
014).
Other exiled Hungarian scholars followed the trend as set forth by Ida
Bobula, elucidating a surprisingly high number of common
characteristics of the Sumerian and Hungarian languages. Amongst
them, we have first to mention Ferenc Badiny Jos (Argentina),
professor of sumerology at the University of Buenos Aires, who tried
to fill the considerable time-gap between the end of Sumer in the Near
East and the birth of Hungary proper in Europe, by means of a
Hungarian language book, "From Chaldea to Ister-Gam" (P 006). The
late Victor Padányi (Australia) concentrated his attention upon the
migrating Hungarians in the Don region (P 101) and C. G. Gostony
(France) produced an etymological dictionary of Sumerian (P 056),
while Sándor Csöke (Austria) compiled a "Sumero-Hungarian
grammar" (P 015). Finally, the comprehensive work of Sándor Nagy
which was written in English, deserves special mention, The forgotten
cradle of the Hungarian culture (P 098). All these works concerned
Surner (Southern Mesopotamia) only and maintained that Hungarian



is the direct continuation of the ancient Mesopotamian language, as it
was spoken in the Illrd millenium B.C., or, as Sándor Csöke expressed
it: "With a few phonetical and grammatical differences, the Sumerian
folklanguage, i.e. the spoken language was, on the whole, the same as
present-day Hungarian."
The next most important step in the elaboration of the orientalist
conception was the extension of the field of investigation beyond
Mesopotamia, to cover the whole Near-East. It was indeed discovered
that innumerable Magyar words were used, not only in Mesopotamia,
but elsewhere too, in the B.C. times, especially in the Nile valley, as
well as in Syria and in Anatolia. In these areas certain texts written
with hieroglyphs or with Phoenician-type characters, can be read in
Hungarian. These surprising results definitely proved that the original
home of the Hungarian speaking population was the entire Near-East
and also that Magyar was a primary language, from which many
others originated. The enlargement of the field of investigations and
the above mentioned decipherings are due to Prof. Tibor Barath,
author of this book, whose three volumes - Ancient History of the
Hungarian speaking Peoples" (P 007) - are fundamental in this regard.
That ancient Egypt had been the most brilliant Magyar homeland, was
first stated by F. Thomas in his Latin study: Conjecturae de origine,
prima sede et lingua Hungarorum (Buda 1806). It must also be added
that the eminent Finnish linguist, Helmi Poukka (Helsinki), has made
an important contribution to the subject with her "Hungarian-Finn
Egyptian word-parallels" (P 105). In her publication, she lists 1,045
identical Egypto-Hungarian words. This work was recently expanded
into an important manuscript of 307 pages, which its author has
generously forwarded to the writer of these lines.
All these studies made almost exclusively by exiled Hungarian scholars
resulted in the elaboration of a new Hungarian ancient history, whose



starting point is in Ancient Near East, in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.
4. In the light of these researches, the basic theses of the Finno-Ugrian
historical conception became more and more untenable; above all the
belief that Hungarian was a language of Finno-Ugrian origin. This
must be a misnomer, declared the orientalists, in view of the fact that
the Hungarian vocabulary includes a mere 7.3% of common Finno
Ugrian words, against 92.7% non-Finno-Ugrian. Moreover, if Old
Hungarian antedates the Indo-European languages, how it could have
borrowed words from them, when they were not yet in existence?
Considering that the Hungarian and Indo-European common words
are embedded in the oldest layer of the latters' vocabulary, the
presumption is strong that these common words were borrowed by
the Indo-Europeans from the Old Hungarian. And again, since the
emergence of the Hungarians took place in the Ancient Near-East, it
seems impossible that the people would have originated in Uralo
Siberia. The tiny Vogul (Manysi) and Ostiak (Hanti) peoples - 9,000
and 21,000 souls respectively - who are now living in Siberia, cannot
vouch for the Northern origin of Hungarians, because
anthropologically they are the farthest removed from them. These
fragments of an original Uralian population were, in all probability,
overrun by a break-away branch of Hungarians (cf. P 059 pp. 173
179), who taught them a few hundred words before being
assimilated. This view is supported by the Vogul name, which is
probably an old form of the present Hungarian Fogoly, meaning
'Captive'. In any case, the Finno-Ugrian theory of history never
succeeded in proving its point to the general satisfaction. Large
segments of the academic world - linguists, historians archaeologists
in particular - remained skeptical and discussed it with great
reservations. For all these reasons, those of the opposite conception
openly rejected it as an obsolete theory.
The pressure against the Uralian conception increased so heavily in



the last ten to fifteen years, that the holders of this antiquated belief
felt themselves cornered, and began a desperate fight for survival.
But, instead of discussing and refuting the pretensions of the
orientalists, they simply declared that the theses of their adversaries
are unacceptable, 'because' they are contrary to the official doctrine.
They soon lost their tempers and started a vilipending campaign. They
everywhere proclaimed that the exiled historians "have been infected
with a Western virus", and that they suffer from "spiritual inebriety",
for whom the "Oriental mirage" (sumerology and egyptology) is but a
"therapeutic gymnastic". They also labeled the orientalists "fanatics,
lunatics, chauvinists, and fascists" (P 008). The Finno-Ugrists also
used administrative measures to silence their opponents, especially
the so-called press-closure, which means that the scientific promotion
of the orientalist conception is banned from the media in Hungary.
Since then in that country, the periodicals, newspapers, publishing
houses, television and radio stations were exclusively reserved for
scholars with Finno-Ugrian mentality. Along with the press-closure,
writers in line with the official dogma were encouraged to prepare
fresh publications in the obsolete spirit, saying nothing about the
existence of the other way of thinking.
It would nevertheless be a mistake to think that the front of Finno
Ugrists is a solidly united one. As a matter of fact, there are, in
Hungary itself, many scholars who already have assimilated several
important elements of the Hungarian researches abroad. Antal Bartha,
for example, has discarded the wrong belief that the early Hungarians
had been forest dweller nomads. Instead, he teaches today that they
were living in river valleys, engaged in agriculture and animal
husbandry, and stood, in every respect, upon the level of
contemporary Higher Civilization. He also maintains that the early
Hungarians had come to the Kama-Volga "meeting place" (no longer
"cradle land"), in successive waves, from a southerly direction, at the



beginning of the first millenium B.C., starting from the area "where
the food-production first had taken place," i.e. from the Near-East
(.Magyar Hirlap, December 15, 1972). Furthermore, anthropologist
Tibor Tóth has conceded that the skeletons do not support the
existence of any early Hungarian settlement in the Ural-Siberian
region. On the contrary, they clearly prove that it actually was in the
Aral Sea region (Kisalföld, June 16, 1972).
This will suffice to mark out the place of the orientalist conception in
the general Hungarian historical researches during the last hundred
and fifty years or so. After a difficult start, it seems now to be closer to
victory. In the following chapters, the author lets the reader become
acquainted, in detail, with the orientalist conception only, avoiding all
controversies.
PART ONE
WHO ARE THE HUNGARIANS?
THE PEOPLE
1. The anthropological build-up of the Nation
Reliable data concerning the anthropological structure of European
peoples, can be found in the standard work of the Swiss
anthropologist Eugène Pittard (P 103) and in the historical race
geography of the Soviet scientist V. P. Aleksejev (P 002). Information
concerning specifically the Hungarians is available in the brief
accounts of Mr. Kosonczi (Sorsunk, Australia, 1959-1960), and in the
two more recent articles by Pál Lipták (P 090) and Tibor Tóth (P 128),
leading anthropologists in Hungary today.
According to the authorities mentioned, the various peoples of Europe
intermingled so much during the last two or three millenia that today



they hardly differ from one another genetically. By and large, they are
made up almost everywhere with the same racial elements, viz. the
white skinned Caucasoids or Aryans;(1) the brownish complexioned
Mediterraneans or Touranians, also called Kush; and a third element,
especially detectable in Scandinavia and in Spain. The latter are
probably the descendants of a pre-Neolithic population called Cro
Magnon-men. Within the said relatively uniform social structure, the
individuality of each people is only characterized by the differing
proportion of the common composing elements. In the case of
Hungarians, the specific ratio is said to be c. 80 - 85% Caucasoids or
Aryans and c. 15-20% Touranids or Kush. The representation of the
Nordic (Cro-Magnon) type in Hungary is so minute that it is
practically negligible.(2)
The great majority of Hungarians (the Caucasoids) is characterized by
a height of 167 cm, a clear complexion, variable eye colour (40% fair
and 40% dark) and medium brown hair. Their face and eyes are of a
vivid tone, their nose is straight, but sometimes high and bridged.
Their general demeanour is a friendly one. According to cranial
measurements, their average cephalic index (CI) is 84.3, i.e. they
belong to the short-headed racial group.(3)
E. Pittard was surprised to find, in a strongly mixed Europe, a
relatively homogeneous population, especially in Central Europe,
which was overrun so many times by foreign invaders since Neolithic
times. But he himself gives us the necessary explanation, emphasizing
the fact that before the arrival of the last huge Hungarian ethnic wave
in A.D. 895, the numerically most important ethnic body in the
country - the Avars - was racially akin to the Magyars: they resembled
each other like "two overflows of a single and same ethnic lake", to
quote the words of E. Pittard.(4) His evaluation holds good even for
the periods prior to the Avars, including Neolithic times. In fact, the
nearly 1,000 extant crania from this age prove that even the earliest



settlers of the Land, almost exclusively consisted of short-headed
Caucasoids (P 103 p. 36). This means that the same human race has
perpetuated itself in Hungary from the earliest historical times in an
uninterrupted continuity.
According to anthropologists, the greatest concentration of the short
headed population is to be found in the Caucasus region.(5) The
farther one moves away from the area, the thinner is the density of
the brachycephalic element. On this basis it was assumed, that the
oldest detectable home of this race was in the Caucasus region,
whence they got their scientific denomination: Caucasoid race. From
their supposed original homeland, the Caucasoids or Aryans are said
to have slowly moved southwards, extending their control over the
whole northern part of Ancient Near-East already in prehistoric times.
They were har-bringers of the so-called Higher Civilization, in which
most people were farmers living in small villages.
The second racial element of the Hungarian ethnic body is the
Kushitic one. Their distinctive anthropological characteristics were the
darkish skin colour and the Caucasian (not African) face.(6)
In contrast to the Aryan agriculturists, the Kush were mainly a stock
breeding population and as such moved around extensively. For a long
time, they lived in tribal communities, without any higher socio
political organisation. They disintegrated easily and many of them
became absorbed into the ethnic bodies of other nations, most often in
subject status, so that they soon lost their own ethnic identity through
assimilation.
Amongst the written references to the existence of white and dark
men in Hungary, the most explicit one is that of Adamar of
Angouleme, author of Historia Francorum (XIth century). He
described a monk's journey through Hungary and claimed that two



distinct races existed there: a white one in Ungaria Alba and a dark
one in Ungaria Nigra, so called after the skin colour of their
inhabitants.(7) Hungaro-Kush relations were, however, almost always
somewhat strained because of the lower cultural niveau of the dark
men.(8) And when the Kush refused to become Christians, King Saint
Stephen (1000-1038) dispersed them all over the country, where they
lost their individual identity. Author Adamar of Angouleme writes in
that connection the following commentary: "King St. Stephen of
Hungary attacked black Hungary with the army and converted the
whole country to the true faith, partly by sheer force, partly by
intimidation and affection."(9)
The anthropological build-up of Hungarians links them to most of the
European peoples, e. g. to the French, so far as they are of Gallic
descent, and to the English as well, so far as they are Britons, Scots
and Picts. On the other hand, Hungarians have genetic connections
with the old Oriental nations (Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, Indians),
and also with the youngest offsprings of the said great family:
Scythians, Huns, Avars in particular. The kinship of Hungarians is large
both in Europe and in South West Asia, and this circumstance explains
why Hungarian ancient history is, in many respects, one of the most
important keys to the general history of Eurasia.
2. The Hungarian language and its great antiquity
A language is characterized by its grammatical structure, vocabulary
and phonetics. When these characteristics are compared with those of
other languages, it can be established which languages are cognate,
i.e. have a common origin. The cognate languages form language
families and have such names as Indo-European, Finno-Ugrian,
Uralaltaic and so forth.
1. The principal characteristic of the Hungarian grammatical structure is



that the root of the verb remains the same throughout the different
variations (conjugations) and to this unchanging root the various
particles are added, called suffixes, to express tense relations, modes
and personal cases. The pattern is always the same: stem +
circumstantial suffixes + case ending. In the following two words: To
give and To write, the basic roots are AD and IR. The root, in itself,
expresses the indicative present, therefore the personal case ending
comes next here, thus: AD-ok, IR-ok: I give, I write. Secondly, the root,
when enlarged with the conditional suffix N becomes AD-N-ek, IR-N
ek: I would give, I would write. Thirdly, when inserting the
subjunctive suffix J, the following forms emerge: AD-J-ak, IR-J-ak:
That I give, That I write. Fourthly, the sign of the past being T, the two
verbs in question take the following forms: AD-T-am, IR-T-am, I gave, I
wrote. The declension of the noun follows the pattern of the
conjugation. There too, the various endings are affixed to the
unvariable root, the nominative case excepted, which is the root itself,
without a suffix. So the noun HÁZ 'House' becomes, with the plural
suffix K, HÁZ-ak; with a second suffix BAN meaning 'In', we say HÁZ
ak-ban, In houses. All the elements of the word thus formed are
written without a hyphen, and merged into a single block: Adtam,
írtam, Házakban, etc. Due to its compact character, Hungarian is called
a synthetic language, or, owing to the numerous suffixes it uses, a suffix
using (suffixed) or agglutinative language.
Two other features of the Hungarian grammar are, first of all, that it
has no gender. So IR may mean 'She or He writes', depending on the
context. Secondly, it has a fully developed unvaried definite article,
used in two forms: 'A' or 'AZ'. 'A' stands before nouns beginning with a
consonant, while 'AZ' is employed before nouns beginning with a
vowels. So we say: A HÁZ 'The house', but AZ EG 'The sky'.
2. Hungarian has a comparatively large vocabulary, thanks to its great
antiquity, and also to the ease with which new words can be made.



Forty words which will frequently appear in the forthcoming chapters
are listed below. They belong to the oldest layer of the vocabulary
and, as such, they are mostly monosyllabic. Words denoting parts of the
human body: 1. KÉZ 'Hand'; 2. KAR 'Arm'; 3. SZEM 'Eye'. Words for
house and its equipment: 4. HÁZ 'House'; 5. HON 'Dwelling' or 'Land';
6. TÁNYÉR 'Plate, Disk'; 7. FAZÉK '(cooking) Pot'; 8. SZÉK 'Chair'; 9.
ÁGY 'Bed'. The environment: 10. EG 'Sky'; 11. FÖLD 'Earth, Ground';
12. NAP 'Sun' and 'Day'; 13. VIZ 'Water'; 14. ÜT 'Road'; 15. MEZÖ
'Field'; 16. KERT 'Garden'; 17. FÜ 'Grass'. Food: 18. MÉZ 'Honey'; 19.
ITAL 'Drink'; 20. SÖR 'Beer-'. Animals: 21. HAL 'Fish'; 22. MADÁR
'Bird'; 23. EGÉR 'Mouse'; 24. KOS 'Ram'; 25. CSIRKE 'Chicken'; 26.
BÉKA 'Frog'. Implements: 27. KÉS 'Knife'; 28. HAJÖ 'Boat'; 29. SZEKÉR
'Cart'; 30. KERÉK 'Wheel'. Religion: 31. UR 'Lord'; 32. ISTEN 'God'; 33.
KÉP 'Image'; 34. MÁS(A) 'Copy of, Deputy'; 35. PAP 'Priest'; 36. TUDÓ
'Magician, Scientist'. Numbers: 37. KETTÖ 'Two'; 38. ÖT 'Five'; 39.
HÉT 'Seven'; 40. SZÁZ 'Hundred'.
How are compound words formed? The simplest way consists of
putting the respective stems together, the determining word being
placed before its dependent as a rule. Examples: Fut -I- Ar = Futár
'Messenger' (lit. Running man); Hord + Ar = Hordár 'Porter' (lit.
Carrying man); Nagy + Ur = Nádor 'Governor, Deputy King' (lit. Great
man). In compound words only the last part takes up suffixes and
case-endings, the compound being considered as a single word. In
addition to the above mentioned process called nominal composition,
Hungarian has another method to build new words with new shades
of meaning. It consists of adding derivative suffixes to the root in the
case of nouns, and placing prefixes before verbs. The derivative
suffixes are very numerous, e. g. - ság (ség) which implies the idea of
'multitude'. Its first form (-ság) fits to roots ending with a back vowel,
while the latter fits to those ending with a front vowel, as in KATONA
ság and PÉK-ség: 'Army' (lit. Soldier + multitude) and 'Bakery' (lit.



Baker + multitude), respectively. In the case of verbs, the most
important prefixed particles are the directional ones, like In, Out, Up,
Down, Forward, Backward, Under, Away, Retour, etc., which are in
Hungarian: Be-, Ki-, Fel-, Le-, Előre-, Hátra-, Alá-, El-, Mellé-, Vissza-.
3. The phonetical structure of Hungarian is largely influenced by stress,
which always falls on the first syllable of the word which is uttered
with greater emphasis than the others. Now, when the tongue has
taken up the necessary position to form a certain accentuated syllable,
it is easier to remain in the same position when uttering the
subsequent ones. The consequence of this laziness of the tongue is a
sound-preference, called vowel harmony. It means that whenever the
first syllable includes a back vowel (A, O, U), the following vowels
must usually be of the same category. The same applies to the front
vowels (E, I), mutatis mutandis.
The sound-preference goes so far as to influence even the simplest
suffixes, which have two forms: the one fitting to roots with deep
tonality (A, 0, U), the other to those with high tonality (E, I). The two
forms of the suffix 'In' are BAN and BEN, and we say FAL-ban 'In wall'
and KERT-ben 'In garden'. The law of vowel harmony also governs the
formation of compounds and mercilessly brings all the vowels into the
general tone of the first, stressed syllable. The result is a completely
new word, in which the composing elements are sometimes hardly
detectable. For example, a great city on the Hungarian Plain got its
name from the fusion of two words, Kecske (goat) and Mat (pasture),
and is today called Kecskemét. In the archaic period, the majority of
nouns ended with a vowel. However, with the consolidation of the
word-stress on the first syllable, the sound of the final vowel became
weaker, and was eventually silenced. With the loss of the final vowel,
the preceding one was usually lengthened as in the following
examples: Old Hungarian Uru became Úr; Sassu became Száz, and
Bharata > Barát.



In Old Hungarian there was a marked preference for deeper vowels as
opposed present usage. Instead of the present 'A', 'O' was used; and
instead of '0', 'U'. So the present word for 'Dust', Por appears in older
texts as Pur; the word for 'Fatherland, Country' Hon appears as Hun;
'Ram' which is today Kos, was then Kus (pron. Kush); and Magyar, the
native name for Hungarian, formerly was Mogur; while the word for
'Beer' Sör, was Sura.
In the process of softening the system of consonants, the 'P', 'T' and 'K'
sounds often changed into voiced sounds: 'B', 'D' and 'G' respectively.
The phenomenon of mutation of sounds is known in linguistics as
sound-shift. Under its impact, almost all Old Hungarian words
beginning with a 'P' sound, changed to 'F'. Examples: Old Hungarian
Pal meaning 'Wall' became Fal; Palu 'Village' became Falu; Patek >
Fazék '(cooking) Pot'; Pekete > Fekete 'Dark'; Penu > Fenyő 'Pine'; and
Pono > Fonó 'Spinner'. In spite of the quasi regularity of the frontal P
> F change, certain ossified words continue to be used in their archaic
forms, such as Pallér 'Contactor', a compound of Fal + Ur, lit. 'Wall
Man'; and Puszta 'Steppe' (in Eastern Europe) which is the compound
Füs + Ta, lit. 'Herbaceous land'.
The softening of the Hungarian sound-system had a second phase
around Christ's birth, which enriched the language with seven new
voiced sounds, written today with double-lettered signs. These are 1.
CS, which sounds like ch in 'Cherry'; 2. GY as d in French 'Dieu'; 3. LY
as I in 'Volume'; 4. NY as n in 'New'; 5. SZ as s in 'Science'; 6. TY as t in
'Tuesday'; and 7. ZS like s in 'Pleasure'. For all these new sounds
(exactly as for B, D and G sounds) there never was any special graphic
sign in the Old Hungarian writing, because its origin antedates the
soundshift.
The above listed 40 words may appear in the following phonetical
forms in old Hungarian written documents: 1. Kete; 2. Kar; 3. Seme,



Zum; 4. (H)asa; 5. (H)on, (H)un; 6. Taner; 7. Patek; 8. Seke; 9. At;
10. Ege; 11. Pod, Pot; 12. Nabu; 13. Pis; 14. Utu; 15. Mese; 16. Kerta;
17. Pu; 18. Medu; 19. Ital; 20. Sura; 21. Khala; 22. Matar; 23. Egur;
24. Kush; 25. Surke; 26. Beka; 27. Kesh; 28. (H)aiu; 29. Sekeri; 30.
Kerek; 31. Uru, Ar; 32. Isten; 33. Khepe; 34. Massa; 35. Pap; 36. Tutu,
Dudu; 37. Khetta; 38. Ut; 39. Hetu, Heth; 40. Sassu.
Now, if we imagine the Hungarian language in its archaic from, i.e.
without voiced consonants, without diacritical signs, and with deeper
tonality, and a vowel at the end of nouns, we will be surprised to see
how closely such a script resembles the alphabetic transcript of certain
Near Eastern languages of the Illrd and Ilnd milleniums B.C. Actually,
with the Old Hungarian phonetic key, it would be possible to
understand certain hieroglyphic texts and inscriptions written with the
Phoenician type of letters. The following specimen shows what
Hungarian looked like around 1200 A.D., two hundred years after the
conversion to Chzistianity and the adoption of the Latin alphabet. The
following two sentences are taken from the Funeral Pryer, which starts
thus: LATIATUC FELEIM ZUMTUCHEL MIC VOGMUC. YSA PUR ES
CHOMUV VOGMUC. Using the present orthography, this text would
be: Látjátok feleim szemetekkel mik vagyunk. Izzó por és hamu vagyunk.
Translated into English in the original sequence of the words and
suffixes, it would be: 'See-you/brethren-my/eyes-your-with/what/are
we/. Glowing/dust/and/ash/are-we/. In this short sample, all the
essential elements of the language are already in their final places and
even the suffixes are solidly "glued" to their respective root-words. It
should also be mentioned that this old text is comprehensible to every
Hungarian of today at first hearing, so little has the language changed
in the lapse of eight hundred years, while the changes, witnessed by
other European languages during the same period of time are,
however, very considerable. So we have to keep in mind that the tempo
of the Hungarian linguistic change is and has always been very slow.



We have a significant assessment of the general build-up and inner
structure of Hungarian by an eminent English scholar, Sir John
Browning (1792-1872) who had a good command of that language
and had translated numerous poems. He expressed his admiration for
its unity, originality and exceptionally strong cohesion. He likened it to
an Egyptian stone monument hewn out from a single block of granite
and upon which not the thinnest fissure is detectable. Its origin dates
back to the times when none of the presently spoken languages of
Europe were yet in existence. "This language is the oldest and most
glorious monument of national sovereignty and mental
independence."
4. Now, the important question is to know to which family of languages
Hungarian belongs and what position it occupies within its group,
according to the newest researches. If Hungarian cannot be classified
as a Finno-Ugrian language, nor as a Turkish one, we have to examine
the third alternative, its connections with the family of Indo-European
languages, that is, we have to look whether Hungarian has
connections with the
Greek, Latin, German, English and Slavonic languages in Europe (the
"Kentum" group of the Indo-European) on the one hand, and with the
Hindu, Sanscrit, Sumerian and ancient Egyptian in Asia and Africa
(the "Satem" group of Indo-European) on the other.
Actually, Hungarian has been compared with all these languages. The
most detailed comparison with Greek was carried out by József Aczél
(1927). According to him, Greek and Hungarian have over two
thousand words in common, in addition to the great number of Greek
place-names, having a definite Hungarian meaning. A closer analysis
has disclosed, however, that the common Hungarian-Greek words are
to be found mostly in Old Greek, i.e. in the pre-Greek languages:
Pelasgian, Cretan and Aegean. - The comparison with Latin disclosed



that its grammatical structure is, in many respects, similar to that of
Hungarian. Latin is also an agglutinative tongue, using a great
number of affixes, both in declensions and conjugations. Moreover, its
vocabulary has many words that are in common with Hungarian
(11.5%), - according to Gy. Hary's word-statistics. The most extensive
research in this regard has been done by Prof. László Szabédy (1974).
The fact that several inscriptions, written in the pre-Latin Etruscan
language, were read in Hungarian by this author, suggests that the
Hungarian words in question must have found their way into Latin
through the intermediary of Etruscan, an Oriental language from Asia
Minor, and that these words are now embedded in the lowest and
oldest stage of Latin, which is similar to the Hungarian words in old
Greek.
The number of common Germano-Hungarian words accounts for 6.1%
of the Hungarian vocabulary. We know little about the common
English words, as no research has been made yet in this particular
field. Their number might be, however, quite significant, proof of
which are several hundred Old British place-names (cf. P 108) that, in
essence, are Hungarian. The British scholar L. A. Waddell has found
enough evidence (see P 132) to prove that the early Brit-Honi
population originated from the Ancient Near-East, together with the
very name of Brit, Prit which sounded originally like Barat, and had
the meaning of 'Companion, Fellow-Traveller, Associate', exactly as in
the Hungarian language of today. A particular British fellow-traveller
ethnic group of the Bronze Age, was the Picti, whose name is
unexplainable in English, but clear in Hungarian. Picti would be
pronounced today, after the P > F change, as Fekete, meaning 'dark
coloured'. We really know from authentic historical sources that the
Picti were a dark skinned people. - The greatest number of French
Hungarian common words are to be found in Gallic place- and ethnic
names, preserved in Caesar's famous report, De bello Gallico (P 030).



But amongst the present French place-names there are also a great
number of Hungarian words, proof of which is the Directory of the
French communes (P 039 bis).
The Slavonic languages also have a considerable number of common
words resembling Hungarian. Their proportion amounts to 13.5% of
the Hungarian vocabulary, according to the above-mentioned word
statistics. It is important to mention that the great majority of these
words occurs only in those Slavonic countries which border on
Hungary, so that they do not seem to be of Slavic origin, but were
most probably borrowed from the Hungarian. If the percentages of all
common Hungaro-Indo-European words are added together, we get
the impressive high figure of 31.1%. This fully justifies the conclusion
that Hungarians must have had long-lasting contacts with the Indo
European-speaking population in the millenia before Christ. But
vocabulary concordances alone, without stronger grammatical
support, are not sufficiently strong to prove close genetic connections
between them.
The relations of the Hungarian language are closer with the Satem
branch of the Indo-European and with Oriental languages in general.
The internationally reputed specialist in Sanscrit, Alexander Csorna de
Körös, summed up his findings on that score with the following
sentence: "The Sanscrit language shows no stronger relationship to
any other language than it does to Hungarian" (quoted in P 098 p.
217). And with regard to the highly developed Sumerian language of
Mesopotamia, Prof. C.G. Gostony (Paris) discovered and mentioned in
his book (P 056), that out of its 53 linguistic features, 51 can be found
in present-day Hungarian. The same author lists over 2,000 Sumerian
words which correspond to as many Hungarian ones. Finally, he
mentions the well-known fact that the native term for the Sumerian
language was E-Megir; the same as Magyar in the old phonetical form.
All this is decisive data so that we must conclude that Sumerian (as



we call it) was merely an early Hungarian language. - As for the
ancient Egypto-Hungarian linguistic relations, they too are very
strong, direct and genetic. Proof of this is the native name of this
language: Makari, which is another old form of the word Magyari.
Besides, Egypt's national name remained Misir to the present day, a
derivation of the same root, like Masar, Magar, Makar. This author has
also deciphered over a hundred short Egyptian texts in his three
volumes: "Ancient History of Hungarian-speaking peoples" (P 007).
Thus, ancient Egyptian must also be considered an old Hungarian
language, in the light of the most recent findings.
From all the above-mentioned researches, which have been carried
out with untiring patience and energy, it is clear that almost every
language of Eurasia is related to the Hungarian with at least several
hundred identical words, while the Sanscrit, Sumerian and ancient
Egyptian languages were cognate with the Hungarian. The first
explanation of this unexpected conclusion was given by the talented
linguist István Horváth, who declared, already a hundred years ago,
that Hungarian, in B. C. times, was a widely spread language in the
Ancient Orient and also the most polished one, so that many younger
languages could draw a great deal from its rich vocabulary. But no one
has taken this bold statement seriously in Horvát's lifetime. However,
it seems now that he has been vindicated. Today it is indeed clear that
Hungarian is a very ancient language and it occupies the central place in
an extensive network of old languages.(10)
5. The final important question to be discussed is this: what would be
the most appropriate linguistic term for the collective appellation of
all the languages having genetic connection with Hungarian? The
most fitting would be, of course, the one which was historically used
for such a purpose: the term Uri 'Aryan', meaning 'Illustrious, divine
(language)', i.e. a civilized one. This term reappears almost regularly
in the native names of every interrelated Hungarian, beginning with



the "mother tongue" whose Sumerian name was E-Meg-Ir, the
Egyptian one being Mak-Ari, and the Hungarian Mag-Ari.(11) The
best known other Aryan languages were Uri, Sub-Ari, Na-Iri and Hurri
in Northern Mesopotamia; Lig-Uri, Hetr-Uri in Europa; Mund-Ari, Kol
Ari and Ma-Uri in India; Ma-Ori in New Zealand, as well as many
others.(12)
Our foregoing conclusions have been recently confirmed point by
point by a team of Russian linguists, namely W. Illitch-Switytch, Prof.
Dia-kanov, A.B. Dolgopolski and others. They were successful in
proving that there was a "Primordial Tongue" (Ursprache) on the
Eurasian continent, to which all the other languages were affiliated
with c. 650 root-words at least. They also have determined the
geographic area correctly, where the first original language was spoken,
namely the tract of land from India to Anatolia and from the Caucasus
to the Persian Gulf. Furthermore, the estimated age of the Primordial
Language also corresponds to the Hungarian: it began at the end of
the last glacial period, about 12,000 years ago. In addition, the
Russian team had purposely included Hungarian in the group of
descendants of the primeval language, because its antiquity has been
"proven."(13) Thus, Hungarian and Russian linguists agree on this
point with one another.
In our judgement, there is only one point the Russians have missed:
they failed to discover the real identity of the primordial language.
Instead of calling it by its own historical name "Aryan", they
introduced the confusing "Nostratish" name first, then, discarding it,
rebaptized the primeval language "Boreish". For us, the essential fact
is, that Hungarian is recognized as a language in its own right, being, as
the mother of many others, perhaps the oldest cultural language of all
Eurasia. Consequently, when looking for the origin of the Hungarian
people, we have to focus our attention first of all upon the Ancient Near
East.



3. Their two most frequently used ethnic names: Magyar and
Hungarian
Hungarians are identified with two ethnic names: Magyar and
Hungarian. The first one is used in the country's native language, the
second in foreign languages. The different use of the names was
already noticed by chronicler Anonymus, the unnamed notary of King
Béla, at the end of the Xllth century. He said clearly that the Magyars
per ydioma alienigenarum Hungarii, et in sua lingua propria Mogerii
vocantur. Unfortunately, he did not disclose the reason for this twofold
use; in his time, any difference between the two names no longer
existed.
Scientists were always eager to find out the original meaning of the
names in question. The Etymological Dictionary (P 084 bis) informs us
that "Magyar' is "an obscure compound", with Magy + Ar, variously
spelt Magar, Mogeri, Meger, Mogur and Miser and meaning, simply,
'Man'. Géza Nagy, a keen linguist, brings us nearer to the answer by
teaching that Magari is a compound with two vocables: Mat 'Earth'
and Ar 'Man, People' (P 117 p. 98). But he does not elaborate upon
what the exact meaning of the resulting new word might be.
Concerning the etymology of the second name, viz. Hungar, our
linguists generally believe, that it is not a Hungarian, but an old
Turkish word, the On-Ogur, meaning 'Ten Tribes', as the tribal
federation was called, to which the Magari people belonged at one
time in the first part of the Vth century A.D. Finally, with regard to the
Ar element occurring in both names, our linguists are reluctant to be
more definite. On this subject we read in a French publication that the
term Aryan is not yet sufficiently clarified.(14) Thus, we come to the
conclusion that we are not on firm soil when looking for the
etymology of the Hungarians' ethnic names on the basis of the
available literature.



In our judgement, both Magari and Hungari are truly compound
words, as it was always supposed. Both of them consist of two
vocables: Magy + Ar (<Mat-Ar), and Hung + Ar (<Hont-Ar)
respectively, to which the adjectival suffix -i is appended. To our
surprise, the lexical structure of Mag-Ar-i and Hung-Ar-i is identical
with that of several ancient ethnic names, like Lig-Ur-i, Ill-Yr-i, Bav-Ar
i, Can-Ar-i in Europe; Col-Ar-i, Mund-Ar-i, Ma-Or-i in India and New
Zealand; and Mak-Ar-i and Onk-Ar-i in ancient Egypt. Today Magari is
no longer spelt with the -i suffix, but simply is Magyar, this new
graphic form having come into practice towards the end of the XVIIIth
century. The comparison of the lexical structure of Ma-gari/Hungari
with that of the other old ethnic names suggests that their origin may
reach far into remote historical times.
What is the meaning of the composing elements of the names in
question? First, the suffix -i appearing at the end of both names, gives
them the meaning of 'Coming from, Native of, Follower of and the
like. The second common element Ar (< Ur) has manifold meanings,
but it always implies an important personage, who has power of
command, such as God, a king, a high official or any free man. And
the first element in Mag-Ari: Mag (<Mat) means 'field, Land'. Thus
the whole compound as a new word signifies 1. 'Subject of the Ruler
of the Land', 2. 'Fellow citizen' or 3. simply 'peasant'. The first element
of Hung-Ari: Hunt, is nothing else but the ancient phonetic form of
the present Hon, Hont 'Country'. So the full compound name Hungari
means 'Countryman, Native'. According to its etymology, it is a perfect
Hungarian word, as is Magari itself, and seems to have nothing to do
with the Old Turkish 'Ono-gur'. Finally, if we are looking for the
difference which may have, in olden times, justified the separate use
of the two ethnic names, we may suggest that Magari actually stood
for peasant, tiller of the soil, whereas Hungari for keepers of animals.
But whatever may have been the difference between the meaning of



the two names in question at the beginning, it soon disappeared.
An allusion was already made to the antiquity of the Magyars' two
ethnic names, which reach back into pre-historic times. Now, we can
confirm it by recalling that the Mat vocable is in general use among
Finno-Ugrian languages and always means the same thing, namely,
'Field, Land, Dwelling Place' (P 110 pp. 85, 88, 89). Considering
further that Finns and Estonians have separated from the Hungarian
speaking body at around 2000 B.C., the common Finn-Magyar word in
question must have been in existence before the said d te, there
having been no later contact between the two groups. Consequently,
the Magari name may be as old as 4000 years. Let us add to the
foregoing that Matu was also known in the Sumero-Babylonian
language as a word for 'Country' (P 056 p. 64) and that "Mat Misir"
was the current term for Egypt in the Old Persian, and "Mat Asyr" that
for Assyria (P 041 pp. 129,146,148). The same can be said about the
word Hon or Hont; it is also a basic word in the whole Finno-Ugrian
language group, meaning in Finnish and Estonian Huona 'Dwelling
place, House'. Furthermore, the same word is also included in the
Sumerian vocabulary, in the form of (H)an, (H)anu, signifying 'Realm
of God', as well as in Ancient Egyptian, where (H)an or (H)on was the
name of the city where the Sungod lived, 'Sun-City', the Greek
Heliopolis in the Delta. Finally, with regard to the second part of the
word, Ar (< Ur): it is generally used both in Sumerian and Egyptian
and several other ancient languages, meaning 'God, King, Ruler or
Man', so that it does not require a detailed explanation. Thus, our
inquiry has shown that the Magyar and Hungar names, together with
their compound elements, can be historically traced back almost five
thousand years. There is hardly another nation in Europe, or perhaps in
the whole world, whose name could be tracked down for such a long
time.
It is also interesting to have a look at the various phonetical forms the



the Magari and Hungari compounds have taken during their existence
as such. The names were first affected by the general softening
tendency of the language. It brought about a soundshift after which
the T sound, both in Mat and Hont, successively changed into D, G
and H sounds, with the resulting phonetical forms of MaDar, MaGar or
MagOr, as well as MaHar. Now, these phonetical forms happened to
sound similar to the words for 'Bird' (Madár), 'Grain God' (Mag-ur),
'Big Nose' (Mag-orr) and 'Bee-king' (Méh-ar, Méh-ur), although the
original name had absolutely nothing to do with them. Still, this
evolution is of the greatest interest to us, because the homopbony
between the national name Magyar and the quoted objects gave birth
to the idea that shaping or drawing a bird, a bee, a face with a big
nose, or grains (beads) arranged in a circle (necklace) showed so
many appropriate ways to "write" Magyar, i.e. to display one's ethnic
identity.
Archaeological discoveries, representing a human figure with a big
nose, occur frequently, especially in ancient Mesopotamia and on the
Aegean islands. In Egypt the picture of a bee constituted a regular part
of the royal titulary, identifying the king as Mehar or Magyar. The
figure of a bird, applied on a brooch, or a bird statuette in clay, or
even real birds kept in the house, were, as many, identification badges
of the owners.(15) There is no mistake in linking these graphic or
artistic figures with the presence of a Hungarian-speaking population,
because the homophony between the ethnic name and the mentioned
objects exists only in that language, as far as we know. Besides, all this
symbolism would have been senseless without the ethno-linguistic
implications. Of course, it is not easy to discover such similarities
without having a good command of Hungarian and a profound
knowledge of its past and present phonetical system. At any rate, we
can say that our ancestors had found a method to establish their first
written documents about themselves, right at the beginning of the



literate period of history. It was certainly a primitive way of writing,
but an ingenious one, the so-called pictorial method, the first form of
writing. Should we then conclude that the early Hungarians also
were, perhaps, amongst the active forerunners in the invention of
writing?
In summing up the results of our inquiry regarding the two most
frequently used Hungarian ethnic names, we may safely say that both
of them were products of the Hungarian language; that they originated
in the earliest historical times, probably in the Ancient Near-East, and
that they identify the Magyars in their religious and politico-social
context.
4. The whereabouts of the Old Fatherland
The previous three chapters have already produced enough indication
that the Old Magyar Fatherland was probably situated in the ancient
Orient, dominated by three mighty rivers - Nile, Euphrates and Indus
and which we call Near-East. It appeared, indeed, that this particular
area was the one where the representative of the two races, out of
whose fusion the Hungarian nation has come into being, were
simultaneously present; where easily workable soil was available for
farming, as well as large grazing grounds for stock-breeding; and
where the agriculturist Magyars and stock-breeding Kush population
intermingled (Fig. 3). The following pages should prove that the
Ancient Near-East was actually the Old Magyar Fatherland, the land
where the Hungarian type of nations have come into being.
1. The presence of an agriculturist Magyar speaking population in the
Ancient Near-East can be traced back in all the three river basins by
the place-, ethnic and personal names, the former inhabitants of the
area had used, and which include basic Magyar words, like Ur and
Magyar.(16)



In the Euphrates valley, to begin with it, the most typical such place
name was that of the City of Ur, whose ruins are called even today
Mugheir (= Magyar), and which had a Maguerre ( = Magyar) ruler.
Not far from that city was located Eridu, the oldest settlement of the
whole Land. Its Hungarian etymology (<H.: Ur-i To) discloses, that it
was built on the shore of a lake, the Present Persian Gulf. Today, the
city is far from the Gulf, but in the IIIrd millenium B.C. it still stood on
the shore, the filling-up of the Euphrates delta with alluvial deposits
having not yet been in an advanced stage. A third important
Mesopotamian city with clear Hungarian name was Nippur (= H.:
Nap-Ur), the 'City of the Sungod'. We know from other sources, that
Nippur was the most important religious centre for the Sun-cult in
Mesopotamia for over a thousand years; a fact which warrants the
accuracy of our etymology. Other Mesopotamian place-names, with a
striking Hungarian meaning were Sam-Ar-Ra (< H.: Szem-Ur)
'Residence of the Eye-God', a variant of Sungod; Mat-Ar-Ra 'The City
placed under the protection of the Farmers' God', and Assour (<H.: A
Só Ura) 'City of the Ruler of the Sand'. Apart of the above place
names, the geographic term Burattu deserves special mention. Its
rootword is Bor, which is ancient Hungarian for 'Water, River', by
which the Euphrates was meant. And the form Burattu is the rootword
Bor enlarged with two suffixes, thus: Bor-át-i, to mean 'Land (or
People) Beyond the River'. This name has taken up manifold
phonetical forms later on, like Berut, Beyrout, Barat, Brit, etc., and it
surfaced at numerous places which the Mesopotamians colonized in
subsequent times (see map showing the diffusion of the Burattu-name
in P 132 after p. 420). In Syria, Canaan and Anatolia, which were
under Mesopotamian cultural and political influence for a long time,
the most important Magyar city-names were: Árpád, on the great bend
of the River, about which more will be said later, and Karkemish and
Damask. The correct transliteration of the Egyptian hieroglyphs giving
the names of Karkemish and Damask is : Karika-Masa and Dama



Szeke, meaning -according to the Hungarian key- 'Deputy of the
Circular Divinity' (Sungod), and 'Residence of the Divine Lady'
respectively.
Fig. 3. The great river-valleys of the Ancient Near East
In the second great Oriental river valley, that of the Nile, the two
Magyar testwords Ur and Magyar again occur frequently. Ur is
included in the name of about a hundred divinities, as anybody may
notice it when opening the book of Wallice Budge, The gods of the
Egyptians (P 026II Index). The same word reappears in other
combinations as well, like in Horus (<H.: Ur-Os) 'Divine Ancestor',
which was the regular title of the reigning Egyptian king. Another of
his titles was Makar, the Egyptian form of Magyar. Contemporary
records speak of a Makari Queen, of the XXth Dynasty (c. 1080-940 B.
C.), who tragically died in childbirth at an early age. It is also
recorded that during the reign of King Zoser (<H.: As Os Ur) 'The



Divine Ancestor', a certain Madir ( = Magyar) was the governor of the
Elephant City. The very name of Egypt was at that time, as it continues
to be even today, 'The Land of Misir' ( = Magyar). Finally, near the
Red Sea, in Eritrea, at the site called Matara, a Magyar language
inscription has been found, and deciphered by the author.
In the third great Oriental river valley, that of the Indus, the two
Magyar testwords come up also frequently. The whole tract of land
from the Caspian Sea to the River Indus, for example, was called Aria
'The Land of the Aryans', as indicated in the Dictionary of Mechitar. In
that same zone lies Iran, whose etymological meaning is not Persian,
but Hungarian: Ur-Hon 'Abode of the Aryans'. Plinius, writing in the
first century A.D., when listing the various peoples of India says this:
Indum accolunt Megari... Uri and other peoples (P 092 p. 98).
Toppeltinus writes in the same sense, stating that the inhabitants of
India are called Magori even in his time, and that they are a powerful
people, possessing a famous land, thanks to their victorius army.(17)
The seven great ancestors of the Hindus were the Mahar-Ishi (<H.:
Magyar Ös) 'Magyar Ancestors', and the most celebrated Hindu
dynasty was also called 'Magyar': Maury. It was founded around 315
B.C., and at its hight, ruled over an immense kingdom, extending
from Afghanistan to Ceylon. Finally, the first comprehensive name for
India was Barat Varsha (<H.: Barát Városa) 'Land of the Barats'.(18)
Apart from the numerous place- and and ethnic names built with the
word Ur and Magyar, the presence of the Magyar population in all
three focal points of the Ancient Near-East can be evidenced by
pictorially written documents as well. This writing, as already
explained, communicates abstract ideas with the pictures of concrete
objects, whose names sound identically. In this way, the Magyars of a
given place, could be identified with the picture of a bird, for which
the Hungarian word is Madar, sounding like Magyar. A second animal,
which was used to identify a Magyar ruler, was the lion Oroszlan



(<H.: Ur-Os-Leny) 'Primeval Divine Ancestor'. We have two good
examples to illustrate the above. First, a lion-headed bird, Madar,
found in the ruins of the City of Ur. It is represented with outstretched
wings, hovering over two deer, Szarvas (<H.: Az Ur-Os) 'The Divine
Ancestor (Fig. 4). The meaning of this combined symbol (bird and
two deer) is Magyar Ur-Osdk 'Hungarian Divine Ancestors'. On the
other hand, an early example of the use of the lion-symbol for
identification purposes is the well-known image of Gilgamesh, the
legendary ruler of the city of Uruk, who is depicted as holding a lion
cub in his arm. The meaning is 'Primeval Divine Ancestor', a title
similar to the pompous "king-of-kings". In Egypt, we have found the
Magyar name spelt with hieroglyphs very clearly as M-A-Kh-aR (land)
(Fig. 7) and in another instance as A Ma-Ti-aR-Ku-Ra 'The Ruler of the
Magyars' (Fig. 8). Thus, it seems clear that the Uri ( =Ari) Magyar
ethnic element was strikingly present in the whole Ancient Orient, in the
B.C. times. This is a major historical discovery whose far-reaching
significance hardly escapes the attention of the reader.

(above).

2. The next question is whether the same can be said about the
darkish complexioned ethnic element, which made up 15-20% of the



Hungarian ethnic body. The comprehensive name of this people was
Kush, and in the jargon of the anthropologists: Mediterraneans or
Touranians. It appears in various graphic forms, such as Kush, Cush,
Kushan, Cassi, whereas its Hungarian form is Kus (pron. Kush), and
meaning 'Ram (people)'. Their Ram-name indicates, that they were,
first of all, a stock-breeding population, keepers of sheep and swine.
In the Nile valley, i.e. in Egypt, they were pictorially identified with a
flat horned ram, whose most elaborate exemplar was found in the
Nubian colony of Sulb (Fig. 9). At one time, a row of ram-statues
flanked the far side of the road leading to the temple of God Amen,
while the near side of the road was lined with lion-statues, the symbol
of Magyars. They were also raising pigs, so their country was called
Sertés-Hon 'The Pig Country', and its ruler was the 'Ruler of the Pig
Country' (See in P 007 II ill. 20), also in plain Hungarian. In addition
to the ram and pig, the Egyptian Kush were ethnically identified with
the picture of their erect-eared, gracile hunting dog of a dark colour.
This animal played the same role for the Kush as the lion did for the
Magyars. It was considered as the ancestor of the dark people, and its
name has been transliterated as Anubis, with an unknown meaning. If
we consider, however, the hieroglyphs of the name (Fig. 12), it
discloses that the right transliterataion is A nép őse (A Né-P U-Se),
which is again in Hungarian and means 'The Ancestor of the Folk'. In
later times, the spotted leopard and the wolf were also in certain
places, substitutes for "Anubis".






The Egyptian Kush of the First Cataract had held a dark skinned lady
in great esteem whom they considered their local forebear. Her name
was written with four signs: with an arrow carrying the sound-group



SAT or SET, then with two half-loaf shaped T and with a sitting
woman figure NU. We also notice that the arrow transfixes an animal
skin PAR (= H.: Bör). Thus this written source identifies the lady in
question in full Hungarian as SAT-T-eT bőrű NU Setét bőrű nő, literally
'Dark skinned Woman', exactly as tradition had preserved her memory.
From this example we altogether learn that the Kush were also called
by the name of'Dark' Setét. King Ramses I (more accurately: Ra-Mása,
'Deputy Sungod') had been governor of the Nubian colony prior to his
ascension to the throne of Egypt, and continued to keep his earlier
title when king. That is what his double cartouche (Fig. 13) discloses,
when read with the Hungarian key: Ra mása, Szudán ura; Ra méne,
Feketék ura 'Deputy Sungod, Ruler of Sudan; Stallion of the Sungod,
Ruler of the Blacks'. So, incidentally we also learn that the Kush were
even called simply Blacks, Feketék.
In the Euphrates valley, i.e. in Mesopotamia, the regular Kush
identifying symbol was also a ram, but one of local species with horns
twisted in the form of a V. Its most beautiful exemplar has been found
in the City of Ur, and dated from the Illrd millenium B.C. The animal
is represented peering from the branches of a Tree of Life, indicating
that it is the ancestor. In Mesopotamian cuneiform writing, the Kush
are referred to as "The dark headed ones" and as NAM LULU.
Considering that the sounds L and R have the same writing sign, and
that duplication of a sign means plural case, the correct transliteration
of the quoted expression should be Nem ur.ak, 'Non Aryans', which is
what the Kush really were. - In the third great river valley of the
Orient, the Indus valley, the number of Kush was exceedingly high, and
the so-called "Indus valley seals" offer abundant information about
them. Nevertheless, they have less significance in Hungarian ancient
history, because the Danubian Hungarian ethnic body derived very
little from them. Therefore, we are restricted to only one Hungarian
written message they had left to us. It expresses, so to speak, the



philosophy of every Kush ruler worth of this name. The seven worded
sentence in question runs thus: Uralkodo kedves, ha ftivesiti a ronakat
orszagaban 'A ruler is liked if he does grow grass on the open lands of
his realm' (see details in P 007 II ill. 36). - As the reader may judge for
himself, there is plenty of evidence to show that the darkish coloured
Kush population had actually occupied large areas in and around the
agriculturist Magyar domains in the entire Ancient Near-East, during
pre-Christian times.
3. Mention must yet be made as to how the relations between
Magyars and Kush developed, and how they finally led to the
formation of "Hungarian nations" in the Old Fatherland. The
connections between the two races in the Near-East lasted for over
two thousand years. At the beginning of this long period, their
contacts were characterized rather by mutual distrust and open
hostilities. As a result, the Kush were defeated almost everywhere and
subjected to political and culturel assimilation. They lost a great deal
of their people but, in exchange, received the badly needed higher
education, which contributed to their later development. The second
phase of their contacts was characterized by large scale intermarriages
and the coming into existence of combined 'Ario-Kush' or 'Cush-Ari'
nations, as this process is well known in Mesopotamia, India, Egypt
and Touran alike.
In the second millenium B.C., the Kush in Mesopotamia were already
so strongly civilized that they were capable of taking over the
government of the land for a while, and freely intermingled with the
Aryans. In India the situation was similar, the Kush were on equal
footing with the Magyars there, and the Indus-valley civilization,
around 2500 B.C., was their common creation. In c. 1650/1500 B.C.,
however, a great catastrophe had befallen India when newly formed
Aryan societies (Aryans II) violently penetrated into the Land, coming
from the West, and while they were busy occupying the Ganges valley,



they disrupted the previous population and split it into several blocks
in bloody battles, which are echoed in the famous poem of Maha
Bharata or 'The Great Barat'. During that general upheaval, the
commixing of the two races advanced farther. Those groups which left
India and went westwards peopled Makran, Iran, Afghanistan and
Touran. Others fled through the passes and gorges of the Hindu-Kush
and descended into the Oxus valley. Following these large ethnic
displacements, several places were given a second name, or changed
the existing one to reflect the new realities. The former Hyrcanian ( =
Aryan) Sea, for example, was being called Caspian Sea, i.e. Kush
Water, and the former Northern Sea changed into Sea of the Blacks or
Black Sea. Double-named rivers and nations were born, like Araxes
(Ario-Kush) river, and Casari (Kush-Arian) nation. Amongst the latter,
people were found with so dark a complexion that "one would readily
believe that they were descendants of the Hindus", - as observed by
Ibn Haukal (P 092 p. 57). With the passing of time, the fusion of the
two races advanced so far that almost everyone had both Aryan and
Kush blood in his veins, and everyone considered himself, with full
right, of Kushitic and Aryan descent at the same time. In other words,
the terms Kush and Aryan became interchangeable. At that stage,
Mechitar was right in saying in his Dictionary, that Aria is also called
the 'Land of the Kush'.
In the Nile valley, the Kush first appeared in the region of Khartum
around 6000 B.C. In the subsequent millenia, they inundated the
whole length of the valley so that when the Magyars arrived under
their leader Menes, in c. 3200 B.C., they had to fight against dark men
to secure a homeland for themselves there. At the end of the first
round of struggling, it seemed that a kind of political condominium
would be established between the two peoples, as the simultaneous
appearance of the Aryan bird-symbol and the Kush dog-symbol on the
national armories of Egypt suggests. But shortly thereafter, a formal



sharing of the Nile valley took place whereby the dark men agreed to
evacuate that section of the river valley which lies above the First
Cataract. This division had, however, not calmed the aggressiveness of
the Blacks, who launched frequent incursions into the domain of the
Magyars. As a result, their country was gradually conquered and
transformed into a colony around 1500 B.C. The Kush were then
pacified for a long period and did not regain their independence until
945 B.C. But, by that time, they were already a completely civilized,
modern nation.
While these events unfolded south of Egypt, the Delta itself had been
under Kush rule for about two hundred years, the so-called "period of
Hyksos rule". The Hyksos were, however, driven out from Egypt in
1576 B.C. together with their native Egyptian helpers. The bulk of the
exiles settled in Syria and Canaan, mostly in the city-states of
Carchemish, Arpad and Damask. The Egyptian kings of the XlXth
Dynasty relentlessly kept on pursuing them, always pushing them
farther and farther, until they left Africa for good and settled in
Europe, including Hungary. The fusion in Egypt of the remaining dark
elements with the white ones was as thourough as it was in
Mesopotamia and in Touran, and the Egyptians themselves finally
believed that they too originated from two ancestors, Magyar and
Kush.(19)
To sum up, our inquiry has shown that 1. the birth of the Magyar
speaking 'Hungarian type' of nations has taken place in the Ancient
Near-East through the fusion of two rival races: the Aryan with the Kush;
therefore that area must be considered as the original Magyar
Fatherland. It is also clear that 2. the population of Danubian Hungary
originated from the Old Fatherland: in the first round directly from
Mesopotamia and Egypt, and in the second from the Caspi-Oxus-Aral
area (Touran); in wave after wave arriving according to the pulse of
historical events (the Semitic and Turkish expansions in the same region)



which forced them to leave their native lands.

PART TWO
THE GENESIS OF THE
DANUBIAN HUNGARIANS
THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE HUNGARIANS
1. Implantation of the Higher Civilization into the Danubian basin
1. "Higher Civilization" is the comprehensive term for the major
material and spiritual innovations made by man during the Neolithic
and Bronze Ages. It signifies a settled way of life characterized by
food-production through agricultural activity and stock-breeding. In
view of the scarcity or total absence of contemporary written
evidences, this early period of human life is usually reconstructed with
the help of its material remains, whose study is archaeology. In the
following account, we frequently use another scientific term as well,
which is "historical Hungary". It means the unitary area of Central
Europe which is bounded on three sides — north, east and southeast
— by the Carpathian mountain ranges, in the south by the Low
Danube and the river Sava, and to the west by the first elevations of
the Alps (Fig. 1). After its principal mountain-range and principal
river, it is also known as the "Carpathian Land" and "Middle Danube
basin", or, more precisely, the "Carpatho-Danubian area". For over a
thousand years (until 1920), this area formed a single political entity,
the Kingdom of Hungary.



'Historical Hungary' is rich in archaeological remains. The most
significant finds which were made there until the mid-fifties, have
been described by Edith B. Thomas in her German language
Archaeologische Funde in Ungarn (P 125). Since that time the soil has
yielded so much valuable new material that this basic work needed to
be completed. The two most important complementary publications
are from Nándor Kalicz: Archaeology of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages
in Hungary, in Hungarian (P 074) and Neolithic Finds at Méhtelek (also
in H., P 075). The international connections of the Hungarian New
Stone Age have first been recognized by Gordon Childe in his
fundamental work The Danube in Prehistory (P 031), while the great
role the Middle Danube area played in spreading Higher Civilization
westward, has been summarized by Jacquetta Hawkes in several of
her comprehensive studies (P 064; P 065 and P 066). The excellent
maps of H. T. Waterbolk (P 134), showing the diffusion of food
production-methods, especially into Europe, are indispensable even
for the student of Hungarian archaeology. These publications may give
the reader a perfectly clear idea and up-to-date information about the
various archaeological aspects of early Hungary.
2. Neolithic agriculture found very favourable conditions in Hungary,
where it flourished rapidly, especially on the great Central Plain and
where mighty rivers — the Danube, Tisza, Maros and Körös — assure
abundant year-round water supply. Moreover, Hungary has extensive
loess soil, which is easily handled, even with primitive implements,
because it consists of very minute, windblown particles of high
capillarity. In addition to agriculture, breeding of domestic animals
(cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and dogs) played an important part in early
food-production. In this regard, a long-horned, Oriental cattle-race
deserves special mention because their descendants can be admired
even today in the Hortobágy National Park near Debrecen.
Manufacturing of pottery, spinning and weaving were the most



important industrial activities. Large vases were made for storage
purposes, smaller ones for every-day use, while ceramic statuettes and
other artistic products satisfied the needs of the Church. Timbered
houses above the ground and small, self-sufficient villages, as well as
incipient writing completed the Neolithic way of life in early Hungary.
There are over 200 known sites that bear testimony of the material
remains of Hungarian Higher Civilization. All were located on virgin
soil, i.e. they form the oldest layer in excavated sites. This is an
important fact because it indicates that there is no trace of previous
more primitive food-production in the Carpatho-Danubian area.
There, the Neolithic appears unprecedented and suddenly, in a fully
developed form. Consequently, this was not a phenomenon of local
origin but was caused by immigrants coming from another region.
The Neolithic Age began in Hungary in the fifth millenium B.C. It first
appeared along the Körös river, in the central part of the Great Plain,
hence its name: Körös culture. It remained the dominant neolithic
group for a period of over a thousand and five hundred years, until
about 3200 B.C. and has left lasting marks upon all subsequent,
similar Danubian cultures. The most sensational remains of the Körös
culture have come to light at Méhtelek in 1973. This tiny village is in
the Upper Szamos valley in an isolated location: about 200 km away
from the centre of this culture. This unique location is explained by
the presence of enormous quantities of obsidian, a very precious
industrial material during that epoch, for whose exploitation a whole
colony was set up. In order to fathom how important this exploitation
was, it is significant that the five pits which were open so far by
archaeologists yielded several thousand raw lumps and finished
wares, as compared with barely a hundred which were previously
inventoried for all of Hungary. Another surprise: nearly sixty Venus
statuettes were dug out in that area, as compared with a total of forty
that were previously discovered. No other such rich obsidian centre



has ever been found elsewhere in Europe (P 096 and P 075).
During the era of the Körös culture, Transdanubia and Upper Hungary
were covered with another neolithic culture, the so-called Danube-I,
radiocarbon-dated c. 4430 B.C. From its decorated pottery, it is also
known as Linear Pottery Culture, or Bandkeramik and its preference for
loess soil is particularly visible. A third major Hungarian neolithic
culture was the Banatian culture (c. 3200 B.C.-2300 B.C.), which
included the Transylvanian Olt basin (Erősd) and formed a link with
the more extensive Tripolje culture in Eastern Europe, famous for its
painted pottery. The fourth was the Tisza culture (c. 2800 B.C.-c. 2500
B.C.) which produced the finest and most valuable pottery. The fifth
or last one was the Péceli culture (c. 2100 B.C.-1900 B.C.). It already
covered the whole territory of Hungary and the Vienna and Moravian
basins as well.
Hungary's five neolithic cultures cover an uninterrupted period of over
two millenia and show a surprisingly high degree of uniformity over
the whole area. They have successfully incorporated almost all the
material and spiritual innovations of the world's first Higher Civilization
which flourished in the Ancient Near East, and became a secondary
centre of diffusion for the benefit of all central and north-western Europe.
(39)
3. Metal-using cultures appeared in Hungary in the middle of the IIIrd
millenium. The first period, from c. 2500 B.C., is characterized by an
abundant use of copper and gold; the second, from c. 1900 to 800
B.C. by its preference for bronze. Hungarian archaeologists therefore
like to speak of separate Copper and Bronze Ages, yet the two periods
constitute but a single one, bronze being an alloy of 90% copper with
10% tin or antimony. That Hungary was capable of developing a
brilliant metallurgy before any other European country is due to the
rich copper mines in her mountains, and the abundance of alluvial



gold deposited in the tributary streams of the Tisza.
A good illustration of Hungary's richness in precious metals at that
time is the gold plate of Mojgrád in Szilágy county (Fig. 25). It weighs
750 gr and reflects a neolithic pattern, insofar as only the eyes and the
nose are represented on it, while the mouth is omitted. The plate was,
in all probability, a sacred object whose brilliant face represented the
Sungod. It may have been the identification plate of a high priest
when officiating. The most distinctive Hungarian product was,
however, the hammer-axe, with a disc for the butt (Fig. 26). It was a
native form, derived from an earlier copper shaft-hole axe, this last
being the derivative of a stone axe. The metallurgic centres of
Hungary were so productive that they literally inundated
contemporary markets with their daggers, swords, spears, arrow
heads, goblets and bracelets. The proper evaluation of Hungary's
metallurgical activities, both in the Copper and Bronze Ages, can be
derived from Prof. Dawson's remarks, who summed up his findings
thus: "It is clear that during this period Hungary was the centre of a
brilliant development of culture which, from the artistic point of view,
surpassed anything that existed elsewhere in Central Europe... The
splendid Hungarian swords and axes, often ornamented with elaborate
spiral decorations, are perhaps the finest specimens of European bronze
work, and supplied the models for similar types of the Nordic Bronze
Age" (P 039 p. 326).



Fig. 26. Hungarian hammer-axe with disc for a butt. It was in
great demand in the Bronze Age.
4. As already pointed out, the neolithic way of life was not indigenous
to Hungary, but came from an outside geographic area. According to
our present knowledge, this can but be the Ancient Near-East, where
all the wild ancestors of domesticated plants and animals were
present and where food-production was achieved at an earlier date.
The accuracy of this fact has subsequently been proven with
comparative archaeology. Scholars of that study discovered, indeed, a
strong affinity, both in form and style, between the earliest Hungarian
artifacts and their Oriental counterparts. It was, in particular, noticed
that the Hungarian axes strongly resembled those found in the Royal
Cemetery of Ur, that Transylvanian sickles originated from
Mesopotamian forms and that the oldest Hungarian pottery was
similar to that found in the oldest layers of the ruins of Ur, Kish, Assur
and other ancient cities of Mesopotamia. Concordances found in the
Nile valley were just as convincing: long-horned Egyptian cattle,
native of the Delta, survives 3000 years later in the Hungarian
National Park of Hortobágy. In the same park, specimens can be seen
of a special breed of sheep with twisted horns, spread horizontally at
an angle of about 120 degrees, now called Racka. In ancient Egypt
these sheep were sacred to the God Khum, the ram-headed divinity.
This race has since become extinct there. In the grave of King
Hasekhe-mui of the Second Dynasty (c. 2703 B.C.-2686 B.C.) a gold
object was found, whose material may originally have come from
Hungary. It is indeed covered with a thin layer of antimony (Sb) and
tellurium (Te) which occur only in the gold of the Carpathian basin.
Another proof of the ancient Egypto-Hungarian connections is the
splendid jar found in Egyed, in Sopron county. The God Thot
recording the sins of the deceased is depicted on its sides.
The civilization of the ancient Near-East embraced not only



Mesopotamia and Egypt, which we just mentioned, but Syria and
Anatolia as well, with which countries the Carpatho-Danubian region
was already directly connected. Such contacts were numerous, as
shown by two enormous rapiers, over 90 cm in length, which were
found in the heart of Transylvania. They correspond exactly to the so
called Shardina-sword from Palestine (now in the British Museum).
There were also bracelets and beads made from Mediterranean shells.
Moreover, certain idols of Hungary are the exact duplicates of those
found on the Island of Cyprus (Élet és Tudomány, 1974 no. 38). The
Boghaz-Kői (Hittite) pottery designs from the XIVth century B.C. had
their duplicates in the Maros valley in Hungary. Hungarian gourd
shaped vessels were like Cappadocian specimens, while Hungarian
bronze jars found in Ózd near Miskolc, and elsewhere, were similar to
their Trojan prototypes from around 2100 B.C. And the gold plate
from Mojgrád shows a close resemblance to a similar figure from Troy
II. Thus Higher Civilization from the Orient reached Hungary
overland, through the Balkan corridor formed by the narrow valleys of
the Vardar and Morava rivers. This route was in use for over two
thousand years and its importance only began to decline after the fall
of Troy II, c. 1200 B.C. The route has been practically closed since the
Vllth century B.C.
In spite of the close links with its Oriental model, the Higher
Civilization of Hungary was not a simple copy of it, since it could
boast of several original features. One of the most important of these
was dry-farming. As a matter of fact, the Hungarian rivers, unlike
those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, had no regular floods. Therefore,
production by irrigation was not practised to a great extent here.
Instead, the Danubian farmers selected the windblown, porous loess
soil for cultivation, after having cleared it of its small growth. Later,
with the appearance of metallic tools and other more efficacious
agricultural implements (plough), it was possible to include heavier



but better clay soil as well into the cultivated area. Thanks to this and
to similar inventions, Danubian farmers were highly superior in
production to those on the Balkans, including Greece. The adaptation
to European environment was a significant innovation; it opened the
door for Hungarian farmers to spread out westwards, into Central and
Western Europe.
Besides the Danubian Neolithic, early Europe possessed two other
neolithic cultures: the Tripolje or Black Earth culture, with its painted
pottery, and the Lake Dwelling culture in Switzerland. The first one
unfolded in Eastern Europe, between the Dnieper and the Low
Danube. Its exact origin is still unknown, although it is certain that it
owed its existence to the same source that gave rise to the Danubian
neolithic civilization. The Tripolje culture disappeared, however, quite
soon after the so-called Battle-axe people appeared, whereas the Lake
Dwelling, on account of its very special conditions, could not be
introduced elsewhere. As a result, the Hungarian or Danubian
neolithic culture remained without rival in central and western
Europe. This privileged situation explains its lasting influence over
vast areas for about two thousand years. The westward extension of
the Danubian civilization proceeded along the Danube and its
interconnections on the one hand, and along the Vistula and Oder on
the other. In the words of Prof. G. Childe: "for over two thousand years
it (the Danube) formed the channel by which the influence of the Higher
Civilization of the Eastern Mediterranean basin, including Anatolia and
Syria, was transmitted to the barbarian North and even to distant
Britain" (P 073 p. 413).(40)
2. The advent of the first sedentary population
1. In the two thousand years immediately preceding the Neolithic Age
from c. 5500 B.C. to 3500 B.C., neither the Middle Danube basin nor
Central Europe in general had any permanent population (P 134).



This fact excludes the possibility that the Danubian cultural and
technical upswing might have been the result of borrowing through
commercial contacts, no one being present at the receiving end. It is
therefore generally assumed that the introduction of the Higher
Civilization in the Carpatho-Danubian area was the work of actual
colonization by immigrant farmers and metal workers.
In fact, the first colonists began to reach Hungary immediately after
the climatic change, in the so-called Subboreal Period. During that
period the average rainfall was less than today, and the yearly
temperature was 7°C above the present average. With the increasing
dryness, dense forests thinned out, marshes shrank to a smaller size or
even disappeared, more room becoming available for ethnic
movements. The Vardar-Morava corridor, which cuts the Balkans right
in half, opened up and funnelled migrant groups of cultivators and
herdsmen in an ever increasing number into Hungary. The bulk of
migrants came from the western parts of the Ancient Near East: from
Syria and Anatolia, although the original point of departure of many of
them was Mesopotamia and Egypt.
The described ethnic movement can best be followed with the study of
old place-names, the 'toponymy'. Its usefulness for detecting ethnic
movements stems from the general human behaviour that immigrants,
as soon as they settle in a free place, give names to the surrounding
geographic features. When correctly interpreted, these names may
disclose the geographic origin of the first colonists, the time of their
arrival, the state of their civilization, their language, their ethnic
appurtenance, and even the area of colonization in the new land. For
all these advantages, toponymy has become one of the most
productive subsidiary branches of history; it may open "dazzling
perspectives," — as the French linguist Albert Dauzat expressed it (P
037 p. 70). The historical interpretation of place-names needs,
however, a very careful analysis, because they were themselves subject



to phonetical distortions, following the various sound-shifts, the vowel
harmony and the shifting of accent. Therefore the first task of the
toponymist consists of elucidating the oldest spelling of a given place
name, which usually conserves the original meaning of the name most
clearly. In this respect, however, the effective contribution of
Hungarian linguists to our knowledge in this particular field was, until
recently inadequate, due to their rather conservative frame of mind
(cf. P 009 p. 56 f.). Under these circumstances, this author had to
supply the basic documentation for this chapter.
2. A first group of Hungarian place-names, throwing light upon the
geographic origin of her inhabitants, includes such names that are
identical to those of their previous dwelling places. The immigrants,
indeed, make use of the same vocabulary in christening, to which they
were accustomed. This habit is verifiable even in our days, and it
explains why we have so many 'London', 'Paris', 'Athens' and other
European names in America, duplicating the toponymy of their former
country. In a similar way, there is, in Hungary, a series of place-names
which are repetitive to those of Anatolia, Syria, Mesopotamia and
Egypt. Let us quote a few such names. First, the name of Troy (anc.
Turia), in western Anatolia, also occurs in Hungary as Torja and Tiirje.
The name of Arzawa in southern Anatolia is duplicated in southern
Hungary as Orsova. The Phoenician city of Arad has its Hungarian
namesake in the great city of Arad. Two Hungarian villages called
Haláp (located in the counties of Zala and Bihar) correspond to the
important city of Haleb (today: Aleppo). The Syrian Bukk valley has its
namesake in Hungary in the Bükk mountain and Bükk town. The
Palestinian Pilis country or Pilis-Ta is identical to the Hungarian Pilis
name, used as a county, mountain and village name. The Palestinian
river Kishont also re-appears in Hungary in the same form as Kishont,
a county-name.
The list of similar place-names continues with Egyptian and



Mesopotamian names. Ancien Egypt had a border-land called Zala or
Sala. It was a marshy region in the north-eastern Delta, where a
fortress was located to guard the military road to Syria. The same
name occurs in Hungary, in both forms as Zala and Sala, a county
which formerly resembled a marshy border-land in its southern parts.
Egypt's Nitra is duplicated in Hungary with Nyitra (anc. Nitra) as a
county, city and river name. The southern part of the Sinai peninsula,
under Egyptian rule since the unification of the "Two Lands" in c. 3200
B.C., was known as Bakon; its Hungarian homonym is also Bakony, a
forested area to the northwest of the Balaton Lake. Even Egyptian
king-names were used as Hungarian place-names, so that Tata, Papa
and Menes are Tata, Pápa, Ménes, Ménfő, Ménfa.
There are several duplicates of the Mesopotamian river names in
Hungary. E. g. Kherka and Sajur, both tributaries of the Tigris, appear
in Hungary as Kerka and Sajó. The Mesopotamian native name of the
land beyond the river Euphrates was Burattu; its Hungarian
equivalent is Berettyó. The Hungarian Karas, Körös and Krassó
correspond to the Mesopotamian Karasu. Finally, northern
Mesopotamia was called Subaru and Subartu to which the Hungarian
Szabar village-names in the Vas, Györ and Nógrád counties
correspond, as well as Sabaria, the capital city of former Pannónia.
Such parallels are not merely coincidental, since certain Arab
historical sources mention that the Hungarians were formerly called
by the ethnic name Sabartoi-Asphaloi.
A second series of Near-Eastern — Hungarian common place-names
are those that contain the name of an Oriental pagan divinity. We have
already mentioned some of them in a previous chapter dealing with
mythology. So it suffices here to remind the reader that the most
frequent divine names in question are the Sungod's various names,
such as 'lord' {Ur, Ra); 'Eye God' {Szemes); 'Sky God' (Ég-Ur); 'The
Enthroned God' (Szék-Ur); 'Heavenly Horse' {Égi Ló). The second



popular pagan divinity whose name is used in Hungarian place-names
is Bál (Baal), the Syrian Fire God. Places bearing the name of this god
are most frequent in the southern half of the country, in the Balaton
Lake area and in Transylvania. This regrouping suggests that the Baal
worshipping colonists may have arrived after the Sun-worshippers.
The third most frequently occurring divinity name was that of the God
Thot, protector of arts and letters in Egypt. Finally, a third series of
Hungarian place-names of Near Eastern origin are those which are
formed with Oriental ethnic or tribal names. These are e.g. Hetés or
Hetis, meaning 'Seven Ancestors' and Hetény, recalling the descendants
of the Hittites, who were led by exactly seven (Héth) princes. Another
Oriental ethnic name is Pilis, which was already mentioned. These
three series of specific Hungarian place-names — duplicating names,
divine names and ethnic names — prove that ancient Hungary received
the greater part of its first permanent population from the Ancient Near
East during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. The first wave was made up
mostly of agriculturists coming into the Carpatho-Danubian area
through the Balkan corridor of the Vardar-Morava valleys.
3. Having clarified the geographic origin of Hungary's first sedentary
population, our attention will be focussed next upon their territorial
expansion in the land. Our research in this connection is based partly
upon the three series of place-names just discussed, and partly upon
place-names which include one of the following six Old Hungarian
formative suffixes denoting dwelling places: 1. Ta (variant: Da)
meaning 'Land'; 2. Hon (var. On, An, Ony) 'Home'; 3. Szék (var. Szeg,
Szik) 'Residence'; 4. Kö (var. Ka, Ke, Kev) literally 'Stone', also 'Village';
5. Pis (>Biz, Viz) 'Water'; and 6. Mat (var. Ma, Mad, Mata) 'Field'.
Proof of the great antiquity of these six formative suffixes is the fact
that today they are no longer used for name-giving purposes, that they
are common in the entire Finno-Ugric language group and that the
words in question were in continuous use in the Ancient Orient since



the IIIrd millenium B.C. at least.
We begin our illustration with the word Ta. It occurs in the following
Near Eastern place-names: Pilis-Ta, Heti-Ta, Cre-Ta, Kushi-Ta, Subar
Tu, Urar-Tu, etc. In European Hungary the following names are
formed with the same element: Ágo-Ta, Bago-Ta, Bak-Ta, Bó-Ta,
Bucsu-Ta, Cinko-Ta, Csaj-Ta, Csász-Ta, Galán-Ta, Ino-Ta, Kádár-Ta,
Kalo-Ta, Laj-Ta, Panko-Ta, Pilis-Ta, Pusz-Ta; further: Ab-Da, An-Da, Or
Da, Ra-Da, Tor-Da, Var-Da. The suffix Hon (frequently without the first
letter, H) was also common in place-names both in the Near East as
well as in Hungary. In the Orient the most widely known such names
are: Ir-An (<Ur-Hon), Tour-An (<Tó-Ur-Hon), Makr-An (< Magyar
Hon), and Macar-On ( = Magyar Hon); and in Hungary: Bak-On, Bak
Ony, Balat-On (<Bál-Ott-Hon), Mos-Ony, etc. Place-names to which
the formative suffix Szék is added are: Bakony-Szeg, Báta-Szék, Bor
Szék, Bükk-Szék, Eger-Szeg (<Ég Ur Széke), E-Szék (< Ó-Szék),
Fehér-Szék, Három-Szék, Kis-Szék, Kö-Szeg, Róna-Szék, Szi-Szek, and
Szék-Ács, Szek-Szárd, etc. With Kö: Barát-Ka, Szabad-Ka, Pát-Ka,
Dobo-Ka, Raj-Ka, Resz-Ke (< Réz-Kö), Pisz-Ke, Bél-Kö, Kö-Szeg.
Names with Pis: Danu-Bis, Ti-Bis, Cola-Pis (the medieval form of the
present Kulpa), Fischa (< Pis); and the dwelling names Pis-Ki, Pis-Kö,
Pis-Káros, Pisz-Ke, Pozsony (< Pis-Hon), Pös-Tyén. And finally place
names in Hungary with Mat: Doz-Mat, Dai-Mat, Ko-Mádi, Kecske-Mét,
Madi, Máta, Modor.
After having selected, by the above-mentioned method, all the eligible
place-names of Oriental origin — over 2,000 names — from the
Directory of Hungarian place-names (P 094 and P 095), and located on
a map showing the 63 counties of Hungary, the following statistics

oversized extension, but with dotted lines only.
** Our data relating to the counties between the rivers Drava and
Szava are incomplete.
The results of the above statistics have been illustrated on a map (Fig.
27), including the eight counties between the rivers Drava and Sava.
Marked with squares are the most densely settled counties, i.e. in
which at least 45 Old Hungarian place-names have been found. The
less densely populated areas are marked with dotted lines, i.e.
counties having at least 30, but not more than 44 Old Hungarian
place-names, while the sparsely populated counties, with less than 30
old place-names, are left in white.
This precious map, issued as a result of a minute inquiry, reveals that
the first permanent population of the Carpatho-Danubian basin was not
spread out evenly over the whole country. It concentrated upon two
major areas: 1. Transdanubia, with prolongations northwards into the
Vag valley and southwards into the Drava and Sava regions; and 2.
Transylvania with extensions into the valleys of the right-bank
tributaries of the Tisza. The two areas were separated from one another
by sparsely populated, marshy zones. Thus, as far as the degree of
civilization and geographic conditions allowed it, the land was already
filled to capacity in the Bronze Age (c. 1900 B.C.) by a permanent,
mostly agricultural population. The areas that were still available for
future migrants consisted of flooded and mountainous regions, excellent
places for pastoral population that soon came wave after wave.

end of the Bronze Age (squares indicate the most densely settled
areas).
3. The identity of the first settlers
The reader has no doubt noticed that most of the old place-names
which were handed down by the first population of the Carpatho
Danubian area had some definite meaning in Hungarian. This fact
suggests that they probably spoke Hungarian. This question shall now
be analysed in more detail.
The archaeological remains of the epoch allow us to distinguish the
presence of three closely related but different ethnic groups. The
largest one was made up of farmers, usually referred to as Magari
(Magyars) or Ari (Aryans). The second largest consisted of those
engaged in animal husbandry, and were called Siculi, Sikeloi
(Székely), while the third and smallest group were pastoralist people,
an occupation frequently connected with the Kush. The following
explanations support the threefold division, based upon the respective
economic activity.



1. That the Danubian farmers were Aryans and first practised their
trade all over Central Europe, was first noticed by L.A. Waddell, who
stated that "the Aryans were the forerunners of the agricultural stage
in the world's civilization" (P 132 p. 49). That these farmers were
MagAri, or Magyars, appears from the analysis of the Magyar name
itself, whose etymological meaning is, strictly speaking, 'farmer'. It
was used, and still continues to be in that sense, both in Hungary and
its neighbouring countries. In Hungarian, indeed, a 'farmstead' was
Major (pron. Moyor), and in the Austro-Bavarian German dialect, the
word for 'peasant' is similarly Mayer and Meyer. Farther west in
Germany, however, the common word for the same term is 'Bauer'.
In addition to the semantic connection of 'agriculturist' with the
Magyar name, there is much evidence suggesting that the bulk of the
Neolithic and Bronze Age inhabitants were really Magyars. Such
evidence includes the ethnic symbols, with which they identified
themselves in pictorial writing. The most widely used ones were: (1)
the bird (Madár), because it sounded like Magyar; (2) the lion, which
was Magaru (= Magyar) in Sumerian-Hungarian; and (3) a bee
(Méh), which combined with the wearer (Ur) formed the symbol
Mehar, which also sounded like Magyar. The role of the first two
symbols as Magyar ethnic identification badges was already discussed,
therefore there is no need to return to this subject. For the use of the
bee-symbol, however, we mention two instances: first, that the famous
neolithic obsidian factory was operating in Hungary at Méh-Telek, i.e.
on a 'Bee-Plot' and secondly that Herodotus records that in the
Carpatho-Danubian region there are great multitudes of 'bees', so that
it is impossible to visit that land (P 067 Book V cap. 10).
At this point we wish to introduce a unique statuette as well, found in
a site of the neolithic Tisza-culture (Fig. 23). It represents the harvest
divinity, holding a sickle in his right hand, an implement whose form
is the wellknown abbreviation in the Hungarian carved script for Isten



'God'. The statuette in question belongs to the category of the so
called 'talking statues', because its posture coveys a message (P 074 p.
21). We can read it by naming its conspicuous elements one after
another: the clenched hand (MArok), the arms in the plural KAR.ok,
the face AR, and the belt RA. These elements identify the God as being
Isten, MA-KAR.ok Ura 'God, Lord of the Magyars'. The ancient Egyptian
kings, who were also considered earthly deputies for God, were
frequently represented in exactly the same posture, as for instance
King Ramses II, whose image is shown above (Fig. 22). The strong
Egypto-Hungarian relations, which are apparent even here, do not
surprise us for all three major Magyar ethnic symbols originated there.
In ancient Egypt, the bird was the paramount divine symbol, the lion
usually accompanied the royal image, while the bee in the royal
cartouche was used to render the king's title as ruler of Lower Egypt.
This suffices to conclude that the bulk of the first sedentary population
of Old Hungary consisted of Hungarian-speaking, agricultural Magyars.
These early settlers transplanted Egyptian agricultural know-how,
tradition and mentality into the Middle Danube basin.
2. Hungary's next most numerous people of the Bronze Age, known by
name, were the Siculi or Sikeloi inhabitants, whose descendants are
called Székely (pron. Sakaly). They form a solid block of two and a
half million Magyar-tongued inhabitants in the heart of Transylvania,
the eastern province of historical Hungary. Their admirable folklore is
their most characteristic ethnic feature and is fully permeated with the
old solar cult. The visible image of their pre-Christian divinity, the
Sundisc, is usually displayed in their coat of arms, together with the
waxing Moon and the eight-pointed star. They are identical to those
seen on ancient Mesopotamian documents. The Siculi believed their
God was a human shaped giant, riding on a horse or in a brilliant
chariot in the sky. All the words used by the Siculi in connection with
the said idea-complex — Sun, Sky, Horse, Chariot, Way, Seat and so



on — belong to the oldest layer of the Hungarian vocabulary. The
etymological meaning of their name is also Hungarian, and
corresponds to their intimate religious life. Sikeloi is, indeed, a
compound with the following elements: S-IKE-LO-I, which would be
spelt today Az Égi Ló-i, meaning 'Follower of the Celestial Horse' or,
more plainly, 'Believer in Sungod'.
The Siculi or Sikeloi always played a significant part in Hungary's
history. Prior to their alliance with Prince Arpad, they were allies of
the Hun-Hungarians, in the Kingdom of Attila, according to our
national Annals (P 120 I p. 101). They also took part in the decisive
battle which brought about the downfall of the Hun Empire. Three
thousand Siculi cavalry-men managed somehow to escape from the
bloody battle and went into hiding in the unidentified Chigla-Field,
waiting for the return of "other" Hungarians (usque ad aliorum
Hungarorum reditum, P 120 I p. 279). As a matter of fact, when they
found out, at the end of the IXth century, that a new Magyar group
was on the way to Hungary under the leadership of Prince Arpad, the
Siculi horsemen, who had been living in the land for a long time,
galloped to the Carpathian passes to great their brethren. Then,
according to their agreement, they helped unify the land into a single
dominion. From that moment on, the fate of the Siculi merged with
that of the Arpad Hungarians.
During the reign of King Attila, the bulk of the Siculi-Hungarians still
dwelt in the western borders of the Carpathian land: in Upper
Hungary and in Transdanubia. They were the stockbreeders of the
epoch, belonging to a semi-military organization in charge of the
defence of the western boundaries of the Hun Empire. They were
directed by chiefs called Lófö, literally 'Great men', a title equivalent to
the medieval marquis. After the Hun-era, when the disintegrated
country was re-united by Prince Arpad and the Nation was converted
to the Christian faith, the eastern borders of the land became the most



sensitive ones. Therefore, the first Magyar kings transferred the Siculi
frontier-guards from Upper Hungary into Transylvania for further
duties. This displacement is evidenced by a series of medieval charters
and more recently by a toponymic study showing that 36 village
names of Transylvania are the exact duplicate of as many Upper
Hungarian place-names (Magyar Múlt, Sidney, 1977 no. 2). The
Transdanubian Siculi, who were not involved in the massive transfer,
remained in their original location in the West. Their long stay here
explains the surprisingly high number of solar place-names, especially
in Zala county, and also the existence of certain common dialectal
particularities between the Transylvanian and the Transdanubian
populations of today.
The fact that the Siculi's first places of habitation were in the western
parts of historical Hungary, suggests that they may have entered into
the land via the Adriatic Sea. The probability of this itinerary is
dramatically confirmed by the presence of other Siculi on the western
side of the Adriatic, namely on the Italian peninsula. This fact also
suggests a simultaneous arrival into both lands in question, around
the XIth century B.C. (cf. P 100 'Sicel'). That the Italian Siculi formed
the integral part of the great Siculi migration is further evidenced by
the fact that they too were led by chiefs called Syc-Lo-Pe and Laes-Turi
Gones, as reported by Thukydides in a distorted form (P 126 Book VI
cap. 18). These terms would be, in the more correct spelling, Sikel Ló
Fö (after the P > F soundshift in Lo-Pe),meaning 'Siculi Great Men';
and Lovas Túri Honös 'Mounted Trojan Ancestor' respectively.(41)
Another significant detail: one of the Siculi kings, Italus by name,
became the namegiver of the whole Peninsula, and also of the present
Italian nation.(42)
The Siculi in Italy were not numerous enough to keep the whole
peninsula for themselves. Actually, they were driven out therefrom
around 1035 B.C., when the majority of them crossed over to the



island of Sicily and forced the earlier inhabitants to retreat into its
western parts while they occupied all the rest of the land, changing its
name to 'Sicilia'. They lived in peace on the island about three
hundred years, until the Hellens began to drive them out. In the VIth
century B.C., the Sicilians were defeated in battle and their separate
national identity was gradually dissolved, — according to Thukydides.
Outside of Hungary and Italy, numerous Siculi tribes were also to be
found in the northwestern Punjab (India). They were locally known as
Sakai or Sakae (P 044 'Sakai'), the same as the Hungarian Székely.
These Hindu-Sikeli were also followers of the Sungod, calling him
Sacra (< Az Ég Ura) 'Lord of the Sky'. His female associate was Sacra
Ni (H.: Sacra Neje) 'Wife of the Heavenly Lord'. All the Hindu Sikeli
were engaged in animal husbandry. To sum up, the Siculi were a widely
diffused ancient race of the Ilnd and 1st millen-iums B.C. One of their
branches became, together with their Magyar brethren, the founders of
European Hungary, as seen from an ethnic standpoint.
3. Traces of a third people are also discernible in the Neolithic and
Bronze Ages in Hungary. They originated from the Kush or Cushan
folk, usually referred to in the scientific language as Mediterraneans
or Dinarians without, however, sufficiently emphasizing their
characteristic brownish complexion. The Kush race was first identified
in Eastern Africa, around the Great Lakes. It was also a widely
diffused old race, but broken up into a multitude of smaller or larger
ethnic entities that lacked any comprehensive political organisation
for a long time. They were the first great historical people to send out
colonists into southwest Asia and into Europe, including Hungary.
The European branch of the Kush seems to have spoken the
Hungarian language: whether through origin or by assimilation, is not
yet clear. At any rate, all their identifying symbols are Hungarian. The
most widely used such symbol was the ram: it accompanied them



through all their wanderings, in Egypt, Hungary, as well as in India
and Touran. Ram in Hungarian is Kos (pron. Kush), which was also
their national name. Their rulers, both terrestrial and divine, were
called Fö-Kos, 'The Principal Kush', and his distinctive symbol was a
kind of spontoon, called Fokos in Hungarian, a word that sounds like
their name. Kristóf Lukácsy, a distinguished Hungarian historian of the
XlXth century, was positively convinced that the language of the Kush
was Hungarian, even while they were still sojourning in the Oxus
region of Touran (P 092 p. 85).
The early presence of the Kush in Hungary is evidenced by a ram
headed altar found in a neolithic layer near Szeged. And the last
notable group of them lived in Upper Hungary, during the reign of
King St. Stephen (1000-1038). Their district was known as 'Dark
Hungary' (Ungaria Nigra), as opposed to 'White Hungary' (Ungaria
Alba), so called after the skin colour of the respective inhabitants.
With the conversion to Christendom, the cohesive force of the Kush
was broken and the people was absorbed into the majority. Their
memory still lingers in such place-names as Kosd (< Kush-Ta), Kosna
(< Kos Hona), Kustán (< Kus Tanya) and the family name of Kós.
To complete the presentation of the European Kush, we must also
mention that classical and medieval historical sources inform us that
both Britain and France have a considerable number of Kush absorbed
in their national body, who were locally called Picti (P 132 pp. 111
126 and P 065 p. 394). The Romans believed that they were so called,
because their faces were "painted", as the Latin word Pictus suggests.
This view is, however, unacceptable because the Kush were already
dark by birth and were called black well before the existence of the
Latin language. The key to the solution lies in the Hungarian
language, in which black is Fekete, whose old Hungarian form had
been Pekete, Pekte, prior to the P > F soudshift. Consequently the
oeiginal signification of the local name of the West European Kush



simply meant 'dark' and not 'painted.' Another local name of the dark
people in the British Isles was Cassi, from whom the Scots originated.
All the details listed above, when combined into a whole, are decisive
proof that the earliest inhabitants of the Carpatho-Danubian area were
Hungarians: variously known as agriculturist Magyars, stock-breeding
Siculi-Székely, and darkish coloured pastoral Kush. In other words the
present-day Hungarians seem to be direct descendants of the first
inhabitants of the land who lived there four thousand years ago.
4. The testimony of the Tatárlaki (Tartaria) tablets
1. The first inhabitants of the Carpatho-Danubian area have
bequeathed us with decisive historical evidence of their ethnic and
linguistic identity, in three inscribed clay tablets found at Tatárlaki
(now Tartaria), near the river Maros, in 1961 (Fig. 28). They turned
up in a mound barely measuring 240 m X 100 m. One of the tablets is
a roundel with a hole, while the two others are rectangular. The larger
rectangular one also has a hole, but the smaller one only bears the
picture of a horned goat. All three tablets appear to have been locally
made, while the accompanying objects come from the Mediterranean
and were either Cretan or Cycladic. The tablets aroused world-wide
interest, because they gave scholars a concrete chance of identifying
the language spoken by the earliest population of the Carpatho
Danubian basin.
Our inquiry about the tablets in question requires an answer to the
following three questions: (1) for which purpose were the tablets
made? (2) what message is written upon them? and (3) to which
historical period do they belong? Amongst the multitude of studies
already devoted to clearing up the mystery of these written
documents found on the soil of ancient Hungary, the most valuable is
that of Prof. M.S.F. Hood (USA) even though he failed to discover the



purpose of the tablets and denied that there was actual writing in the
signs carved upon the pieces.(43) Concerning the age of the tablets,
there were two opinions. The first emphasizes the Mesopotamian
character of the writing and, on that basis, suggests that the tablets
may have been made in the Uruk-period, somewhere around 3000
B.C. The second opinion, that of Prof. Hood, insists upon their Cretan
parallels and upon their Aegean and Anatolian connections in general.
Accordingly, the holder of this second view assigns a considerably
later period to the objects and suggests that they may have been made
between 2000 B.C. and 1700 B.C. Since then, no new judgements
have been formulated so that the mystery of the Tatárlaki tablets
continues to remain unsolved, more than twenty years after their
discovery.

near the river Maros. They were used for the purpose of solar
observations.
2. In our procedure of trying to find the secret of the Tatárlaki tablets,
we must first ascertain the purpose for which they were made. This
inquiry begins with the etymology of Tatárlaki, the name of the village
where they were discovered. It is a Hungarian compound, whose last
element (-Laka) means a detached, small cottage, literally 'the
dwelling of. But the first part of the name (Tatár) cannot be
interpreted as having been the dwelling of some Tartarian person,



because Tartars never lived in Hungary, particularly not in pre
Christian times. The full name in question is actually made up with
the following elements: Tat-Ár-Lak-a, the vocalized form of an original
deeper sounding Tót-Ur-Lak-a, with the literal meaning of 'God Thot's
Cottage'. That makes sense, because God Thot was an important
Egyptian divinity: patron of writing and reckoning, who was also in
charge of measuring time and doing solar observations for the
purpose of calendar making. In that perspective it seems logical to
conjecture, that the Tatárlaki tablets themselves may have been used
for solar observations and, ultimately, for setting up calendars.(44)
This conclusion is supported by other, circumstantial evidence.
To begin with, the plot where the find was made is a small one,
inadequate for farming. It was, however, large enough to make
astronomical observations, especially during the summer. Then, the
picture of a crab and a horned goat, engraved upon the tablets, is
further evidence supporting this idea. The same animals, indeed, are
part of the Zodiac, the crab being the symbol of the Cancer
constellation, and the horned goat that of the Capricorn. Moreover,
the circular hole appearing both on the roundel and upon the larger
rectangle must have been connected with celestial observations,
because this latter hole is surrounded by sunbeams to show,
unequivocally, that the rising Sun is meant thereby. Finally, the most
conspicuous details of the roundel supply us with the decisive word:
Calendar. In fact, the circular hole represents the Sun, in Hungarian
NAP, the giant cross intersecting the roundel carries the sound-value of
T, and the circular rim of the object supplies the final constituent AR.
These sounds, put together, give the word Nap-T-Ár, Naptár, which is
the Hungarian word for 'Calendar'. It seems thus certain that the
Tatárlaki tablets were components of a sophisticated solar observatory,
and were used for determining time.(45)
3. Before proceeding to our next task, i.e. deciphering the script



engraved upon the tablets, we must take a glimpse into the
astronomical thinking of Antiquity. At that time, the Sun was
considered a human-shaped divinity always on the move in the sky,
following a fixed yearly path, during which it bypasses 12 important
stations or groups of conspicuous stars called constellations. Several of
these groups appear before the eyes of observers, as shaping celestial
animals. Hence their names: Aries, Crab, Lion, Capricorn and so on.
All together, these animals form the 'Animal belt' or Zodiac. The
Zodiacal constellations were closely watched by ancient astronomers,
because they were suitable phenomena for measuring time. Certain
ones heralded the beginning of the seasons on a fixed day: Spring
(March 21), Summer (June 22), Autumn (September 23) and Winter
(December 22). In the northern hemisphere, the constellation that
could be observed most easily, was the one which signaled the
beginning of Summer. Daylight lasts longest on that day, when the
Sun ceases to ascend higher on the horizon, and begins its downward
course. This change of direction takes 11 days, during which the Sun
rises every morning at the same time and on the same point of the
horizon, as if it had stopped moving. So much suffices to understand
the sense of the message upon the roundel, to which we now return.
The sound-signs appearing on the round tablet are, in our opinion,
not Sumerian picture-signs, but more advanced carved signs. Most of
them correspond to Old Hungarian writing signs (see Fig. 14). The
only major difference the Tatárlaki tablets display vs. the Old
Hungarian letters lies in their outward appearance: the Tatárlaki
writing has a marked preference for linking signs together into bizarre
geometric shapes. The very close resemblance of the Tatárlaki signs to
the Old Hungarian ones invites us to try to read the mysterious
message in Hungarian, beginning with the roundel, according to our
Fig. 29, whereon the signs are separated into words.



Fig. 29. The sound-signs of the Tatárlaki tablets, separated into
words.
The first part of the message is placed in the upper half of the object
in question. It reads from left to right and the signs are transliterated
as follows: eZ. iR-áNY-O(n) J.öN eS.T.eN. 4. 05
Ó-Ra.K.oR. With present spelling: Ez irányon jön Isten 4.05 órakor, in
literal translation: 'God comes (= the Sun rises) in this direction at
4:05 o'clock.' The second part of the message, inscribed on the lover
half the roundel, reads in the reverse direction, from right to left, as is
indicated by the so-called turning letters, specially N, R and K. It runs
thus: ELE.RE aR.áK. S.iL.oK ég.ö-Ve.Be(n) 5 + 5 + eGY (= 11)
É.Ta.K-áN, in present spelling: Előre a rák csillag égövében 11 éjszakán
'Beforehand the Crab is twinkling in its celestial zone for 11 nights.'
Is our reading reliable? It is, when considering the following. First, the
decipherment produced a coherent and closely reasoned message, in
which all the written signs appear with their own sound-value. This
fact alone is usually considered as sufficient proof for the correct
reading. Secondly, the message uses a highly technical language,
according to the time and circumstances, which we can however
understand, since we already know the fundamentals of ancient
mentality. Besides, it follows the golden rule of the well written



ancient inscriptions, inasmuch as it uses seven words — not less, nor
more — in both sentences. Finally, all statements referred to in the
inscription are accurate, and all have been confirmed, since then, by
modern science. In fact, on the first day of Summer (June 22), the Sun
rises at Tatárlaki, on the 46th parallel, exactly at five minutes past four
o'clock.
Our next problem is to decipher the message inscribed upon the larger
rectangular tablet. It is divided into three compartments. We are, alas,
unable to make out the meaning of the signs placed into the first
compartment; but the remaining part is clear enough and says: 'Here
the Sun rises in the Cancer (constellation) on the day of...' (missing
sign?).(46)
The smaller rectangle has no carved script scratched upon its surface,
nor a hole to let the sunbeams penetrate into the observatory room.
On its surface is a horned goat with an eleven-branched tail, symbol of
the Capricorn constellation which announces the beginning of Winter.
Behind the goat, the outlines of a roaring animal are discernible,
probably that of the celestial dog, urging the Sun to ascend on its
brilliant way again. That the goat's picture holds for the Sun, is
evidenced by its having five legs, five being the sacred number of the
solar divinity. To make a hole on this tablet would have been useless,
because in winter the sky is usually overcast in Tatárlaki, and no
astronomical observations can be made.
4. The last question in connection with the Tatárlaki tablets deals with
the setting of the approximate date when the tablets could have been
in use for solar observations. Prof. Hood approached this question by
comparing the tablets with similar archaeological remains found at
Knossos in Crete and concluded that the Tatárlaki tablets cannot be
older than their Cretan variants, i.e. not older than c. 1900 B.C.
Therefore, he added, if the solar equipment in question has been



found in a neolithic layer, that could only have happened if the pit in
which it was found had been dug from a higher archaeological level.
Our own estimation, based upon the history of writing, supports the
opinion of Prof. Hood all the more, because certain dating terms, such
as "eleven times", appear on the similar Cretan tablets as well. Since,
however, the writing on the Tatárlaki tablets is more mature, a
younger age would be more suitable for them. This age can be
determined through a mathematical operation, by converting the
sidereal time given in the inscription, into our present time-computing
system, taking into consideration the phenomenon of precession. This
term designates the specific rotation of the Earth's axis which causes
the beginning of the various seasons not to always occur in the same
group of stars (constellation), nor on the same day. The vernal point
actually advances upon the ecliptic at a rate of one day in every 72
years. Therefore, after a shift of 30 days, i.e. 2160 years (= 30 X 72),
the sunrise will already occur in another constellation. The Tatárlaki
tablets report that the Sun's descending course happened on the
eleventh day of the Cancer constellation. On the other hand we also
know that the Cancer constellation lasted from c. 2220 B.C. to c. 60
B.C. (P 118 p. 78). Thus, its approximative age results from the
mathematical operation: B.C. 2220 minus 11 X 72, that is 1428 B.C.
As it disclosed, the Tatárlaki inscriptions constitute decisive historical
evidence, whereby it becomes clear that the first permanent population
of the Carpatho-Danubian basin spoke Hungarian and that their leaders
had highly sophisticated knowledge. That Hungarians were in evidence
in Central Europe considerably earlier than was theretofore believed, is a
fact which obliges us to substantially modify our historical conceptions
about the peoples of Europe in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages

1. The Old Hungarian script
1. Prior to the adoption of the Roman alphabet in the early XIth
century, Hungarians used a set of sound-signs of Phoenician origin for
writing. The historical term for this old system of writing is Rovás,
meaning 'incised, engraved' or 'carved' script, the name describing the
technique of writing. Foreign language scientists called it "linear" or
"geometric shaped" script, thereby alluding to the form of writing.
On this subject, there is an abundant literature beginning with the
very precious Latin language work of J. Telegdi from 1598
(reproduced in P 115 p. 91 and f.). More recently, two eminent
comprehensive works were written, one by Gyula Sebestyén (P 115
and P 116), and the other by Dezső Csallány (P 035). Thanks to these
and to similar other publications, we have a perfectly clear idea how
this system worked: we know which were the sound-signs, the rules of
writing and the writing material as well. In addition, some forty
extant original inscriptions allow us to see the system in operation.
The incised or linear script was, in all probability, invented in the
ancient Orient, although the specific area remains unknown. It is,
however, clear that the earliest form of this writing was simplified by
Phoenician scribes who then spread it all over the Mediterranean from
the XIth century B.C. onward. It is also known that a similar type of
writing existed in the Indus valley already in the second millenium
B.C. In subsequent times, this was also simplified and spread to Lower



and Upper Asia, mainly amongst Turkish peoples. Finally, following
the opinion of Sir Flinders, then Petrie, several scientists maintained
that the earliest incised signs were used at Abydos, in the Upper Nile
valley for the purpose of pot-marking, in Neolithic times around 3200
B.C. Thus, a higher chronology seems to be preferable for this
invention, the more the ancient Hungarian word for scribe is Tudo,
which is the same in ancient Egyptian (Tutu and Thot), in Sumerian
(Tudu) and also in Finnish (Tataa).
After Hungary's conversion to Christianism, the carved script, like
everything associated with paganism, became a liability. Therefore, its
use was banned by King St. Stephen (1000-1038) who also ordered
the destruction of all the existing records written with the "diabolical
letters." With the passing of time, the existence of the Old Magyar
writing was almost totally forgotten. Its last vestiges were swept away
with the appearance of modern writing material and the invention of
printing.
What we know about the sound-signs of the Hungarian carved script,
may be summed up in the following. First., that in the XIIIth century,
under the impact of the Roman alphabet, the list of the Hungarian
sound-signs was gradually enlarged, to become a regular alphabet, i.e.
having a special sign for each sound. But up to that period, and earlier
in history, this writing used a considerably smaller number of graphic
signs. The paucity of the signs required is explained by the fact that in
this writing there is no difference between short and long vowels,
consequently it needs only five signs to write them instead of
fourteen. Furthermore, the scribes often used unvoiced consonants (T
and P) to write their voiced counterparts (D and B), whereby new cuts
could be made. The number of required writing symbols were even
further reduced by eliminating the vowel signs. This was possible by
the particular character of Hungarian, wherein vowels have no
grammatical role, the root remaining always unchanged. The "vowel



dropping" or "vowel jumping" as this practice was called, was further
justified by invoking the phonetical particularity that every consonant
already includes a vowel sound with which it is uttered. Thus, adding
a special sign for this vowel, would be superfluous. At this stage, the
names Barabas and Aladar could have been written as B-R-B-S and L
D-R respectively and the reader had to supply the necessary vowels in
speech. With the almost total elimination of vowels, the consonants
have taken over the leading role in the writing. Therefore, the carved
script was also called a "consonantal script."
According to the principal rule of writing, all words were to be written
phonetically, as they were uttered, irrespective of etymology, exactly
as in present-day shorthand. A second rule required that the words of
a given message be written immediately one after another, without
separating them by a white space or in any other way. Thirdly, the
direction of writing depended largely on the nature of the writing
material. In the earliest times, and as long as the writing was done
with a knife on small sticks or wooden tablets, the direction was
usually from right to left. In more recent times, when paper, ink and
pen came into use, the natural direction of writing with the right hand
went from left to right, starting at the upper left end of the paper.
Writing by incision on wood, stone slabs or metal plates was a time
consuming operation, especially when the place of the individual signs
had first to be marked out for some valid reason, such as symmetry or
exiguity of space. Thus, the need for accelerating the writing appeared
very soon. The easiest way to do this consisted of creating
abbreviations for the most frequently used words, such as God and
Sun. But the most effective method consisted of combining two or
more signs into a single figure, saving strokes here and there. Such
graphic contraction or "ligatures" most frequently resulted in the case
of N and T, S and T, A and R, K and R, etc. (see the sign-lists, Fig. 14).
The frequent use of combined signs was a special feature of the



Hungarian incised writing at its zenith. The principal rules of the
carved script must always be kept in mind, not only when we are
deciphering inscriptions in Hungary, but in examining Ancient Near
Eastern inscriptions as well, the principles of old writings having been
the same everywhere and in all systems. The Old Hungarian writing
was often called a "Scythian script", "Hunnic way of writing" or "Siculi
alphabet". These three denominations are as many indications
warning us that several socio-cultural groups (Scythians, Huns, Siculs)
were using the Magyar writing system in the Danube basin prior to
the advent of the Arpad Hungarians in 895 A.D. In other words, they
must all have been interrelated Hungarian type of nations.






Fig. 14. The O.H. alphabet
A similar conclusion results from the fact that the knife, which was the



principal writing instrument all over South-Western Asia, was known
everywhere by the Hungarian word Kés (pron. Kash). For example, the
deadly knife every Scythian kept in his boot-leg, was A Cina Kesh. This
word Kés is mentioned several times by Ptolemy in his Geography
when describing the Oxus region. Knife, even in the ancient Egyptian
language was Kesh. These data will help researchers figure out the
vast area where the Hungarian version of the carved script was in use.
2. Let's now consider three specimens of the Old Hungarian script. The
first one (Fig. 15) was found on the old wall of the Presbyterian
church of Dálnok in the Háromszék county during repairs. It uses
frequent ligatures and reads from left to right. We transliterate it thus:
eSZ.T aR-éG.I Fa(l)-R-A. Ró-Ja Ó-Ko.Ri Ma-G.aR R.O-N-A-/K-aL/.
With present Hungarian spelling: Ezt a régi falra rója ókori magyar
rúnáikkal/. In English: 'This is being incised on the old wall /with/
archaic Magyar rune/s/.(20)
The second inscription shown (Fig. 16) was incised on the wall of the
Ambassadors' Hostel in Constantinople (Turkey). It records, in three
lines, the rough handling of the members of the embassy, sent to
Sultan Selim I by King Ladislas of Hungary in 1515. The inscription
was first deciphered by William Thomsen (Copenhagen), then
completed by Gyula Sebestyén, and corrected by Dezső Csallány (P
035 p. 77). It reads from right to left, the first line (only reproduced
here) saying: 'This was written in the year 1515 when King Ladislas'
five envoys were kept there waiting.'



Fig. 16. Old Hungarian inscription of Constantinople, Turkey. It
reads from right to left.
The third inscription shown (Fig. 17) was painted on the ceiling of the
Unitarian church of Enlaka in Udvarhely county, in 1688. It reads also
from right to left and proclaims the fundamental doctrine of the
Unitarian confession, that God is only one person (contrary to the
Catholic doctrine of Trinity). The same principle is repeated twice
nearby in Latin thus: "Deus unicus" and "In honorem unius veri Dei".
The message in Hungarian runs thus: Egy az Isten. Deut.VI. Georgyius
Musnai deakon, 'God is (only) one. Deut. VI., George Musnai deacon.'
3. A pleasant feature of the Old Hungarian script was that its
inscriptions were quite frequently accompanied by some pictorial



drawing, as is the case in the Enlaki (Fig. 17) inscription. These
pictures are not only added for the sake of illustration; they are
fulfilling a more important role: they usually emphasize the main
point of the message. As such, they constitute a special kind of writing
with pictures. As was already illustrated when dealing with the
Magyar and Kush symbols, this method of idea-communication was
based upon the homophony existing between two different words,
mostly between a noun and a verb, i.e. between a concrete and an
abstract idea. Examples: Fog as a noun signifies 'Tooth' and as verb it
means 'To grasp'; and Hal is 'Fish' as a noun and 'To die' when it is a
verb. Now, to write the abstract idea 'To grasp' or 'To die', the scribe
had to revert to the concrete object to write the pictorially inexplicable
idea. In such cases, either the context or some additional sign warns
the reader that the sound-signs signify something abstract. Given the
very special character of the pictorial writing, if we can successfully
decipher such writing in Hungarian, we thus have the decisive proof
that the text is in Hungarian.
In the case of the Enlaki inscription (Fig. 17), the pictorial



complement includes a paragraph-like sign on the four sides of the
frame; this is the regular sign for the double-lettered GY-sound. With
its built-in vowel, it means eGY, egy 'one'. Then, in the centre-stage,
there is a milk-jar with flowers. The Hungarian word for milk-jar is
Köcsög, whose Old Hungarian form Kétség is homo-phonous with
Kétség 'Doubt'. The flowers in the jar are tulips, in Hungarian Tulipán,
a homophon of Tele-van, 'Is full'. Now, when all these homophonous
elements are put together, the following sentence emerges: EGY
KETSEG-TELE-VAN.
In present day Hungarian: Egy kétségtelen van, indicating once again
the Unitarian dogma: 'One (divine person) doubtless exists.' Of course,
for a reader not versed in Hungarian, it is not easy to follow the
acrobatic stunts displayed by the scribes of pictorial messages.
In conclusion, we may say that the Hungarian carved script dates back
considerably farther than was supposed until now and that its
importance goes far beyond what was acknowledged by certain foreign
authors. The Old Hungarian script is a strong link which binds the
Hungarians to the Near-East where the first literate nations of the world
had emerged. All that has a considerable bearing upon the historical role
of the early Hungarians.
2. The Old Hungarian faith
1. It is a foregone scholarly conclusion that zealous Magyar kings of
Christian Hungary put all their energy into eradicating the last roots
of the old pagan creed from the Magyars' soul.(21) These kings,
indeed, ordered the destruction of the heathen altars and temples,
and severely punished the venerators of rivers, fountains, groves, trees
and stars. The kings also persecuted the diehard servants of the
ancient divinities, treated them as pariahs and committed them to the
care of Saint Lazar. Whatever element of the old belief and custom



escaped the purge was baptized and incorporated into the new
religion, or relegated into the realm of folklore.(22)
It would be, nevertheless, a hasty conclusion to say that the Magyar
kings totally succeeded in brainwashing all segments of the
population. There remained, indeed, much evidence proving the
survival of the old faith, not only in folklore and place-names, but
even in the royal administration. Moreover, the elements constituting
the old faith were to a great extent brought into the Christian religion,
including the very name of the heathen god, so that Christianization
cannot be interpreted as total break with the past. As a major proof of
this, Arnold Ipolyi, author of a monumental "Hungarian mythology",
was able to collect a more than ample documentation about the old
faith as late as the second half of the XIXth century. Moreover, the
work of Ipolyi has been completed since then, with plenty of new,
detailed data. What the otherwise successful scientists were unable to
prove, however, was the positive identification of the chief Magyar
divinity: the Sungod. Therefore, they also failed to established the
relationship of the Magyar faith to the great Oriental solar religion,
especially with that of Egypt.
2. An Arab historian, Ibn Rusta, in reporting about Hungarians of the
IXth century, observed that "they are worshippers of the Sun and the
Moon." This summary statement emphasizes the root of the matter,
which can be advantageously completed with Magyar sources. In a
pagan Magyar hymn to the Sun, we read for example this: "Thou art
the primeval Tree of Life... from which everything springs; by which
the night of evil spirits is chased; to which everything in this world
returns" (P 130 p. 7). The rising Sun was greeted by the farmers of the
Csik county with their hats off, and with the following words: "Be
welcome, oh Sun, thou bringest us daylight and giveth warmth to our
soil. Be blessed, thou, who disperses the dark clouds, and ripens our
ears. Be glorified thou, who waters our crops and adorns our fields



with flowers" (P 125 p. 339 and f.; P 020). These quotations prove
that their idea of God included the belief in a divine creation, and that
God governs the created world. It is also clear that the Sungod was
mostly venerated in his capacity as tutelary deity of the agricultural
population. His most important task was to illuminate the Earth,
which he did by means of a shining globe that travelled daily across
the firmament from east to west.
God's principal residence was supposed to have been in Heaven, inside
the fiery disk, called Nap 'Sun'. He also had dwellings on Earth,
especially in stone idols, called Bálvány (< O.H.: Baluan = Bál-Hon),
'Idol', literally 'God's home', in Latin Simulacrum 'Hiding place'.(23)
The numerous stone idols served as appropriate places for God to
keep a close watch over the behaviour of his creatures. Other earthly
houses reserved for God were the temples, built in a round shape and
therefore called Rotundae in Latin. The inside diameter of such
temples hardly measured over four to six meters and they were
erected during the XI-XIIIth centuries; about a hundred of them have
already been identified. In spite of the fact that they were erected in
the Christian era, they could not have been intended for Christian
rites, because all the believers could not attend the ceremonies in such
a small space. Several place-names refer to the former existence of
Rotundae, being compounded with the word Kerek 'Round', such as
Kerek-Egyház a, 'Sacred House of the Round Shaped God'; Kerekes
Kápolna 'Circular Chapel.' Many other villages in Hungary are called
Eger-szeg (Ég-Ur-Széke) 'Throne of the Heavenly Lord', suggesting that
in such places too, regular divine services used to be held. Still other
places were reserved for religious feasts. These were often hilltops, as
their names indicate, like Bálvány-Kö 'Place of Idol'; Áldó Kö 'Place of
Blessings'; Oltár-Kö 'Altar Stone'; Isten Széke 'God's Throne'; Áldomás
Tető 'Celebration Peak', etc. (P 082 p. 365 f.).
The general name for God was Isten, with no certain etymology. For this



word there was a special sign in the carved script, resembling a
combination of three consonantal signs: S-T-N. While the special sign
for Sun resembled an inverted S crossed with four oblique strokes (see
the sign-list, Fig. 14), God's name was often preceded by the word Ur
'Lord' to say Ur-Isten 'Lord God'. Because of God's round-shaped
appearance, he was called Kör-Isten, 'Circular Shaped God', a name,
which may be the origin of our word Keresztény (<O.H.: Körösztén),
'Christian'. Living in the Sky (H.: Ég), God was also called Ég-Ura 'Sky
God'. But he was also referred to by the well-known Oriental name of
Ra 'Sungod', especially to indicate places, mountains, and rivers
enjoying divine protection. Such names were like these: Ra-Monya,
Ra-Mocsa, Rá-Tót, Rá-Kos, Rá-Dóc, Ra-Hó; and in reverse word-order:
Nyit-Ra, Mu-Ra, Tát-Ra, Fát-Ra, Mát-Ra.
The name of the Sungod was evoked several times each day, whenever
people met. In the morning, they greeted one another — as they do
even today — with the saying Jó reggelt 'Good morning', literally Jó Ra
Kelt 'The good Ra has risen'. And in the evening the greeting formula
was — and is — Jó estét 'I wish a good Sundown'. Of course, the
original meaning of these expressions has long been forgotten and
nobody thinks of the daily movements of the Sun any more. The
ancients, however, automatically linked every phenomenon of the
daily life to God's intervention.
The Sungod in Hungary had over a thousand Sun-symbols. One group
of such symbols was usually geometric in design, consisting of spirals,
circles, globes, rosettes, inverted S-forms linked to one another, and
sun-beams radiating from a central spot. These symbols are seen
everywhere, cut in stone, painted, or artistically represented. A typical
object upon which several of these elements appear simultaneously is
the Sun-gate, as the decorated entrance to many Magyar houses in
Eastern Hungary is called. Upon such a door of Csik-Szent-Király (Fig.
18), the rising Sun is represented with its beams, and the door of



Harasztosi, in Torda Aranyos county (Fig. 19) has spirals carved upon
the door-posts on both sides which are flanked by two attending stone
idols, with globe-like heads. And on the top of the door, a series of
pigeon-holes allow these birds to nestle there. Birds and deer appear
most frequently amongst the animal symbols. Birds without
outstretched wings usually indicate sorrow and grief; with
outstretched wings (as the eagle and falcon), they symbolize the
glorious Sun. The deer as solar symbol was used in the winter solstice
ceremony. Its role was to bring back the shining disk of the Sun
between its horns, after it was reborn on December 25th.

Anthropomorphic representations of God were less frequent.
Hungarian archaeologists have nevertheless unearthed a beautiful
terracotta divine statuette, representing a man, sitting on a throne and
holding the Isten-symbol in his hand (Fig. 23). On the other hand, the
human eye was often used to represent God on numerous occasions,
probably because the Sun was considered as an all-seeing One-Eyed
Giant. In this connection he was called Szem- Ur and Szemes 'Eye God'
and 'He who has an Eye'. The eye-motive is one of the most frequent
decorative elements in Hungarian folklore and is called Isten szeme
'God's Eye' (P 014 p. 78). Several villages and rivers were placed
under the protection of the Eye-God, e.g. Szemes-on-Lake Balaton,
Szomoroc and the river Szamos (= Szemes).
In spite of the many traces of this Suncult in Ancient Hungary, it is
almost unbelievable that no major research has been devoted to this
problem of paramount historical importance. Shorter investigations
have only been made during the last few years and shed some light
upon certain aspects of the role of the Sungod in Hungary (P 004; P



003; P 121; P 020 and P 122).
3. Under whatever name the solar divinity might have been venerated
in Hungary, it always had a multitude of servants at its disposal called
Papok in the plural, and Pap in the singular, meaning 'Priests'. They
had a lot of things to do. Their duties included star-gazing, and the
observation of the yearly path of the Sun, especially for the purpose of
calendar-making. Certain other priests were assigned to special tasks,
as was the case of the 'Eye priests' or 'Sem priests', whose distinctive
garment was the spotted leopard skin thrown across over the
shoulders when officiating. A further group of special priests consisted
of 'Male priests' (Kan papok), whose exact duties have, however, not
yet been elucidated with sufficient clarity. At any rate, this saying was
associated with them: Kár a kanpapnak a rák, which reads identically
from both ends and means that "it is futile serving crab to a male
priest." This is because he dares not eat it, crabs being sacred to the
solar divinity. Every priest used holy water extensively when
officiating, exercised many charms and often wore a mask. When he
was not wearing one, a feather was his usual head ornament.
Amongst the intermediaries between God and his followers, the Táltos
or Tátos, 'Scientists' had a somewhat spectacular role, similar to that
of the medicine-men. Their name originates from the word Tudó (<
O.H.: Tutu), meaning literally 'He who has knowledge.' They also were
known as Bölcsek 'Wise men'. They were capable of curing diseases,
averting elemental catastrophes, knew how to purify wells, and could
reveal the whereabouts of stolen objects, and so on. Their ceremonial
garment was made of feathers, and a long one was fixed upon the
head. Their footwear was also decorated with bird-claws. They spoke
the bird-language (bird = madár = Magyar), and their equipment
included a ladder (P 040; P 047; P 086). The Tátos had the power of
ascending to Heaven and entering into direct contact with the
Sungod. To this end he used his high ladder. The presence of a ladder,



Létra in Hungarian, was to emphasize, pictorially, the sense of the
ceremony, this word being homophonous with the abstract idea of Lát
Ra: "Ra (the Sungod) sees me."(24)

The most important religious feast was the winter solstice on December
25th when the Sun, after having reached the lowest point of its yearly
wanderings, began to rise again. The 'Returning Sun' or 'Reborn Sun'
was celebrated in all corners of the country with the performance of a
drama whose central theme was a miraculous deer coming through
the clouds from Heaven, bearing and bringing back between its horns,
the shining disk of the Sun (P 015 p. 71). The summer solstice on
June 21 was another great religious holiday in Ancient Hungary. Its
purpose was to celebrate the glorious rising of the Sun to the peak of
its yearly path. It was marked with colossal mountain-top fireworks.
In Old Hungarian religious thinking, death was not considered the end
of man's existence-, it was rather regarded as the most important
turning point of a life which continued thereafter in eternal happiness



in the company of the Big Bird, as an 'Associated bird', i.e. a semi
divine being. The transition from earthly to eternal life was marked
with great solemnities. The coffin of the well-to-do farmer was carried
to the grave on a cart drawn by six oxen and various objects were put
into the coffin, a custom proving belief in an afterlife. Amongst such
objects, a needle and thread were also included to enable the
deceased to mend his garment when necessary. Money was also put
into the hand of the deceased so that he could pay for the toll when
marching over the plank leading to the other world. And the grave
digger had to be reminded to make a 'window' on the new home of
the defunct, so that he might come up on certain days to see his divine
master the Sun (P 077 p. 59-62).
The memory of the defunct was kept alive by a stone monument
erected upon the grave and provided with a short inscription and
geometric symbols. A special Hungarian feature was the equilateral
cross sign MAS carved within a circle (AR or RA), stating that the
defunct had become Mas-Ar or Ra-Mas 'Deputy for God' or a 'Hero'.
Another widely spread custom was — and is even today — to mark
the burial place with a beautifully-carved wooden column made by
the deceased himself before his death. This column reveals to the
initiated the sex, age, rank and wealth of the dead person. In the case
of a male, the top of the column is usually conic while that of a female
is hollow or tulip-shaped. The column commemorating a child is
usually smaller in size and light in colour (Fig. 20; P 135 and P 069).
4. How long may the suncult have been practised by the Hungarians? In
connection with this question we have to remember that Estonians
and Finns originally lived together with a group of Hungarian
speaking peoples until their ways parted around 2000 B.C. and,
notwithstanding the great time-span separating them, they too have
kept alive a substantial number of identical Sun-symbols in their
folklore. The giant tree reaching into Heaven is called in Finnish Sam



Po, pronounced Szem-Fa in Hungarian (after P > F), 'Eye-God's Tree';
while Sam-Mas in Finnish resembles the Hungarian Szem-Mas 'Deputy
for Eye-God'. Such and similar concordances suggest that the Suncult
belonged to the spiritual heritage of all Hungarians of any
denomination before 2000 B.C. Another time-element is to be found
in the Old Hungarian ballad "Julia, the beautiful girl." Reference is
made therein to the spring equinox which was then celebrated during
the zodiacal constellation of the Bull (Taurus) group of stars. It is now
known from astronomical calculations that said constellation occurred
just around 2000 B.C. (P 122). As mentioned above, this
chronological evidence confirms that the Suncult was practised by
early Hungarians in the New Stone Age, or perhaps even earlier.
The age of the Suncult in the Danubian basin itself can be guessed
upon the basis of archaeological finds adorned with solar symbols.
Numerous such relics have been unearthed since 4000 B.C. Danubian
farmers, in particular, carried the spiral, the meander and the other
geometrical designs everywhere across Europe (P 064 p. 332).
Hungarian archaeologists have brought to light miniature cart-models
— Sungod chariots — at seventeen different places, all fitted with
discwheels and dated c. 2700 B.C. and 2300 B.C. Sun symbols
continued to appear in Hungary, without interruption, during the
Copper Age (3500 B.C. - 1900 B.C.) and during the Bronze Age (1900
B.C. - 900 B.C.). And later, when the Roman Empire ruled in large
parts of Hungary, in the first three centuries of the Christian era, a
magnificent Sun-temple was erected in the City of Savaria, the present
Szombathely. It was the greatest such temple ever built in Europe
(16.5 m X 9.5 m), displaying a giant Sun-disc above its altar.
All the quoted data prove that Sun-worship was a regular feature in the
spiritual life of Hungary from the beginning of Neolithic times until the
adoption of Christianity. It survived even after that turning-point, as
witnessed by the great amount of evidence found in folklore, place



names, mythology and history.
Concerning the geographical origin of the Danubian Sun-cult, all our
evidence points toward Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Hungarian
scientists working on this specific field, prefer, nevertheless, to
emphasize the primary importance of Mesopotamia (Sumer). To
support their view, they cite the numerous concordances existing
between the two countries' mythology, they mention the absolute
similarity of the Sumerian and Hungarian names for Sun (Nap), Lord
(Ur) and God (Isten) and insist upon the parallels existing between
the two countries' inhumation practices. All these concordances, as
well as many others are undisputable. Non the less, the concordances
between Hungary and Ancient Egypt are by far more numerous and
far more important. Not only were the general names of the Sungod
identical: Ur, Isten, Nap, Madár, but also the specific names: Sky-God
(Ég Ura), Eye God (Szem-Ur), Travelling Lord (Ut-Ur), as well. A
similarly striking resemblance exists between the priestly class of the
two countries, beginning with the generic name Pap 'Priest'. Egypt had
also its Eye-priests (Sem-priests) whose ceremonial garment, also of
spotted panther skin, was thrown across the shoulders. Egyptian
priest, gods and high-ranking officials also often appeared in
ornitomorphic garments, as did their Hungarian counterparts who
had, at least, one bird-feather fixed upon their heads. The feast of the
reborn Sun (December 25) was celebrated all over Egypt with the
same ardour as in Hungary, and so was the important date (June 21)
of the summer solstice. The Sungod's paramount symbol was, on both
occasions, the shining disc. The burying of the deceased was just as
ceremonial in Egypt as in Hungary. The Egyptians also believed that
the soul of the deceased departed from the body at the moment of
death and flew on wings to his heavenly creator to become his
companion for ever. In Egypt the physical remains of the dead person
were also put in a grave, accompanied by such objects the deceased



may have need for in his new life, which is also similar to Hungarian
practice. And in the 'house' of the deceased in Egypt, an opening or
shaft had to be made so that sunbeams could penetrate through it at
certain hours of the day. Even a ladder was put into the grave, or at
least the picture of a high ladder, to enable the deceased to climb on it
and see the Sun. Without adding any more to the list of Egypto
Hungarian concordances, we may conclude by saying that Hungary
has preserved almost the entire mythological heritage of Ancient Egypt of
the IIIrd and IInd millenia B.C., even two thousand years after Egypt's
beacon had been extinguished.
5. Traces of a second religion can also be detected in Hungary's
folklore. This was the so-called fertility cult which was totally different
from the Suncult. Its purpose was earthly: to insure fertility both in
the human and animal worlds. Its central divinity was the Mother
Goddess whose two main Hungarian names were Great Lady (Nagy
Asszony) and Happy Lady (Boldog Asszony.) Her memory is preserved
in anthropomorphic symbols, the so-called Venuses, which are small
statuettes representing a naked woman.
Ample anthropological evidence suggests that the fertility cult is as old
in Hungary as the Suncult itself. Scholars have, indeed, dug up a
considerable number of Venuses dating from the Neolithic Age (3000
B.C. — or even earlier). These figurines are of two kinds: elaborate,
ornate anthropomorphic Venuses, and small statuettes of baked clay. A
particularly ornate Venus statuette was found on the Neolithic site of
Kökény-Domb, near Hód-Mező-Vásárhely which possesses all the
characteristics of a Mother Goddess, including her strongly
accentuated femininity. Small Venuses were found on almost every
excavated Neolithic site. In Méhtelek, however, near the Upper Tisza
river, a single place has yielded over sixty such figurines. Amongst
these statuettes several were of steatopygous type, indicating the
presence of African elements in the population.



Comparative archaelogy has established beyond a doubt that the
Hungarian fertility cult originated in the Eastern Mediterranean,
especially Canaan, Syria, Phoenicia and Anatolia, which were the
homelands of the Baals, As-Tart, As-Turat,
Kedves, Telepinus and others with clear Hungarian names which seem
rather coarse to-day. The fertility cult seems to have been the apanage of
the darkish coloured ethnic element whose principal lifestyle was stock
breeding, while the Suncult may be attributed to the agricultural, white
population.
3. The Oriental background of the first Hungarian dynasty
1. The origin of the first Hungarian dynasty is shrouded in deep
mystery. One thing is however certain, namely that Prince Almus,
father of Arpad, was its first great figure. His throne-name, Almus, is a
compound-word of two elements: Eld + Masa and signifies 'Deputy
for the Living (God)', an Oriental title, perfectly suited to describe the
office Almus held, that of the native ruler of the autonomous group of
Hungarians, subjects of the Chasar Great-King, the 'living god'. That
Almus was a ruler's title is confirmed by the additional fact that the
native ruler of the Bulgars, who lived on the shores of the river Volga
in c. 921, had an identical throne-name.
Further evidence that Almus was the first important figure of the
Hungarian dynasty is his divine origin. In the Ancien Orient, it was
indeed a widespread belief that great kings, especially founders of
dynasties, were superhuman beings and were therefore fathered, not
by ordinary earthly beings, as the common mortals, but by the
Heavenly God. This god was supposed to return to Earth in the shape
of a bird, on the very night of the conception of a future sovereign, to
impregnate the expectant mother personally. In ancient Mesopotamia
the divine impregnator took the form of an eagle, called Turullo; in



ancient Syria the fertility god was As-Tur, and in ancient Egypt the
Pharaohs were conceived directly by Ra, the Sungod.(25) The mother
of Almus was also visited that specific night by a divine bird called
Astur (< Az Túr) or Turul (< Túró Ló) 'Fecundator, Impregnator', who
foretold that from her womb glorious kings would be born.(26)
Because of their divine origin through the solar bird Turul, the
descendants of Almus were known as the Turul progeny.
In addition to the "Turul legend", the Oriental background of the first
Magyar dynasty again becomes visible in the physical features of the
first divine infant, Almus. "He was pleasant-faced, but darkish
coloured; had big eyes, a tall and slender stature, with big hands and
puffy fingers."(27) The description of Almus' general appearance
baffled scholars ever since, because the Prince resembled an Egyptian
Pharaoh of the late dynastic times much more than the presumed
Uralo-Siberian white man. The features of Almus are no longer a
problem: on the contrary, they provide further strong evidence of the
dynasty's Near-Eastern origin.(28)
In the year 895, when the military conquest of Hungary was in
progress, Prince Almus led the southern wing of the army-group,
scheduled to penetrate into the Carpathian basin from the southeast,
by way of the Lower Danube. His son, Prince Arpad, headed the
northern army-group, which was equipped in Kiev, and was supposed
to enter into the selected land through the northeastern pass of
Verecke (841 m). Father and son both were to meet inside the
Carpathian arc, on the lowland, the military target of their giant
pincer-movement. Almus was however unable to complete his task in
time due to the unexpected assault of the Petchenegs from behind. For
his misfortune, it seems, he was ritually killed by his followers on the
outer foothills of the Carpathians. This barbaric custom of eliminating
an unsuccessful leader was another Oriental practice, similar to that of
Biblical Moses who would not see the promised land, but had to die



before he reached his goal to atone for some sin he had committed.
2. Arpad, is the most illustrious name in Hungary's history. According to
records preserved in medieval chronicles, this Prince was a
descendant of King Attila, the world-conqueror (+453). His illustrious
kinship with him might have been, however, only a distant one,
considering that more than four hundred years separated Arpad from
his presumed forebear. Anonymus, the unnamed medieval historian
(c. 1200), when discussing this subject seems to share this view,
stating simply that Prince Almus, father of Arpad, descended from an
offspring of King Attila. Be it as it may, the real or fictive kinship with
Attila helped Prince Arpad tremendously to consolidate his grip upon
the entire central Danubian basin, the future Hungary. He proclaimed
indeed, everywhere and repeatedly, that he was not coming as a
vulgar conqueror to create bloodshed, but as the legitimate successor
to his forebear King Attila, to take possession of his heritage. And the
inhabitants of the land, hearing this and seeing Arpad's mighty armies,
bowed before their new master.
The name Arpad was also a throne-name with a definite meaning.
Chronicler Anonymus, the often cited notary of King Béla, spells the
name on one occasion thus: ARpad (P 120 I p. 57), with the intent
perhaps to warn us that the name is a compound, made up of Ar +
Pad. If so, he was right, because Ar-Pad follows the pattern of Mat +
Ar and Hung + Ar, with the difference that in Arpad the composing
elements appear in an inverted sequence: Ar-Pat instead of Pad-Ar.
Now, the meaning of Ar is known: 'Lord, Ruler, Sovereign'; and so is
that of Pad or Pod (to-day: Fold) 'Earth, Land' (after P > F soundshift
and the elision of the jammed L in Fold). Accordingly, Arpad means
'Sovereign Ruler of the Land'. Once again, the indication of the
Prince's status is exact: it reflects the Chasar king's policy to gradually
promote the Hungarian native ruler to a more independent status.



Further light can be shed upon Arpad's Oriental connections by
examining his Near Eastern homonyms. There was, indeed, a "Kingdom
of Arpad" in ancient Syria in the first millenium B.C. It was a city-state
located near the great bend of the Euphrates river, some 20 km north
west of Aleppo. Its former site is known today as Erfet (after P > F
soundshift), to which an important ford on the Euphrates belonged.
The Kingdom is mentioned several times in the Bible (II Kings c.
18/34 and c. 19/13). Its mortal enemy was the Semitic Kingdom of
Assyria, against whom King Mati'ilus (= Magyar) organized the
common defense with the Urartian king Sarduris III. The formidable
Assyrian army had to lay a three-year siege around the city before
reducing it into submission in 740 B.C. A few years later, the ruler of
the kingdom tried to regain his independence, but he failed and his
domain was completely obliterated. The population fled on the only
escape route that was still open: northwards, through the Euphrates
valley, to settle beyond the Caucasus mountains. All these tragic
events must have been linked somehow with the emergence of a
Caucasian Hungarian Kingdom, proof of which is that in both areas
in Syria and in the Caucasus — Magyar place-names are o found in
super-abundant numbers.
Regarding the throne-name Arpad, it goes back into history even
farther. The ancient Egyptians revered, e.g. a ruler of that name as
their very first king.(29) The name Arpad or Erpet is mentioned
several times in the Egyptian "Book of the Dead" (P 027 pp. 18, 138,
435 and 649). It was again an Arpad who, after having reunited the
desintegrat-ed country, assumed the royal dignity in Thebes and
founded the XIth Dynasty (P 025 II p. 196 and f., see hieroglyphs
ibidem). Due to the great role Arpad played in ancient Egypt, Prof.
Gardiner and W. Budge made extensive researches to find out more
about this legendary name. They concluded that it was written with
four sound-signs as AR-P-A-T or AR-P-A-D, followed by two



determinatives. The first one was that of 'Cloth, Earth, Land', and the
second, a human figure, indicating that the person so named was a
great-man. Thus the Egyptian name Ar-Pad meant literally 'Land Lord',
i.e. owner of an important agricultural domain somewhere along the
fertile shore of the river Nile.(30) When the determinatives were
omitted, as was usually the case in well-known names, the expression
became a simple name. These data prove that 'Arpad' was a very
ancient royal title and that its bearers had sojourned at length in Syria
and especially in Egypt, before entering into Danubian Hungary.(31)
3. How were the titles of the Hungarian kings written pictorially? It was
done with the figure of a lion, because the name of this animal,
Oroszlán, sounded like the expression Ur-Ös-Lény 'Primeval Being of
Divine Origin'. The earliest extant lion symbol used by the Arpad
dynasty in Hungary was the one carved upon the crystal globe of the
coronation sceptre, originating from the Xth century. According to
archaeologists, the crystal in question is of Egyptian origin, this being
the only country where it is found (P 003 p. 59, 62). A more elaborate
lion-symbol was found painted on an interior wall of the royal palace
in Esztergom, built in the XIIth century. It could be reconstructed into
its original form with what remained of its former parts (Fig. 21).
Other lions kept close guard before an interior well of the royal palace
of Visegrád (XVth century). Furthermore, the seven sovereign Magyar
princes who elected Arpad to be their ruler and commander, also had
lions on their coats of arms. The custom of representing royalties by
lions also goes back to Mesopotamia, Egypt and India, as mentioned
before. In Mesopotamia, the lion had already been the royal symbol of
Gilgamesh, the legendary ruler of Uruk, who was usually shown with
a lion cub. In Egypt, the lion was the regular companion of the kings
and farther east, in India, it was particularly in evidence during the
Maury (= Magyar) dynasty. These kings erected huge columns with
lions placed on top throughout their vast domain. Thus, there can be



no doubt as to the origin and meaning of the lion symbol which
clearly indicates the Oriental background of the Arpad dynasty.
The Arpadian coat of arms had seven horizontal stripes, four red and
three white. It perpetuated the memory of the Seven Magyar Princes
who concluded a contract of mutual blood-relationship to henceforth
form a single nation. The stripes, in horizontal arrangement, signify, in
the old
Egyptian hieroglyphic system, as many 'Land Lords', Hon-úr (Aner).
Thus the seven stripes mean Hét Honúr 'Seven Land Lords'. The
number seven was considered the lucky number all over the Ancient
Near East.(32) In addition to the striped escutcheon, Hungarian kings
used a second shield as well, consisting of a double cross rising from a
three-arched base. When these elements are read according to the
rules of the carved script, the following word emerges: the double
cross carries the syllable eGY, one arch is the sign for the Sh sound,
three arches signal the plural case: Sh.ek, and these sounds, put
together, form the word egy-esh.ek, i.e. Egyezség, meaning
'Agreement, Pact, Alliance', which is another reference to the contract
of blood-relationship.(33) The stripes and the double cross were later
placed upon a single shield, which was divided into two halves by a
vertical line. Thus, the shield conveys the following meaning to us:
Hét Honúr egyezsége 'Agree-ment of Seven Princes'. This combined
figure became Hungary's heraldical symbol until it was officially
discarded by the communist régime.
At first, Hungary, had two royal crowns, a Corona Graeca and a Corona
Latina, so named after their respective origin. A few centuries later,
the two crowns were welded together, to form a single one. There is
no plausible explanation for this act, says Prof. Áldásy, a leading
authority in Hungarian heraldry. The mystery may, however, be solved
since a similar event had taken place in ancient Egypt. Originally,



there were two crowns in this country, one for Upper and another for
Lower Egypt. And when the two lands were reunited into a single
domain, and the fusion of the two states had reached an advanced
stage, the two crowns were reunited into one. It is possible that the
fusion of the Hungarian crowns may have been prompted by this or by
some other similar event.
Through the various facets of the first Hungarian dynasty (1000
1301) which we analyzed, we were led to the conclusion that this
dynasty was deeply imbued with Oriental thinking. And what regards
the founder of this dynasty, Prince Arpad, there cannot be the slightest
doubt that he descended from a, long line of ruling families, experienced
in leadership.
4. How the Nation remembered its origin
Most of the existing traditions relating to the origin of the Hungarians
have been recorded during the XHIth and XIVth centuries. These
written accounts, called Gesta (deeds of valour) or Chronicles (annals)
are continuous narratives, usually in the Latin language, reflecting a
religious and patriotic spirit.(34) The earliest and most valuable Gesta
Hungarorum was written by the unnamed (Anonymus) notary of King
Béla, between 1196 and 1203. The author, a former student at Paris
University, served in the royal Hungarian Chancellery, and was later
elevated to the rank of bishop. The topic of his work is the successful
re-conquest of the Middle Danube basin by Prince Arpad, leader of the
Magyar tribal confederation at the end of the IXth century. The next
important national chronicle was written in c. 1282 by Magister Simon
de Kéza ('Kézai' in Hungarian), court chaplain of King Ladislas IV
(1272-1299) a ruler with avowed heathen leanings. The freer
atmosphere prevailing in the king's court permitted Kézai to devote a
large part of his book to the old fatherland and to assert the identity
of the Magyars and Huns, regarding Attila as a Magyar king.



Therefore, in his view, the advent of Prince Arpad and his followers in
895 appears as the "second entry" of Hungarians into the chosen land.
After Anonymus and Kézai, several other national chronicles were
written, one of the most eminent having been the admirably
illustrated Chronicon Pictum (c. 1385). There is also a Tarihi Ungurus
(History of Hungarians), translated into Turkish from an unknown
Latin original, after 1543.
What the chronicles knew about the Hungarians' ancient history is
briefly summarized on the following pages, namely: (1) the genesis of
the people, (2) the geographic location of the old fatherland, and (3)
their migration toward the West. Both Anonymus and Kézai were
convinced that the Magyars are an ancient people, originating right
after the Flood, when all human beings were drowned, except a single
family: that of Noah. They assert that the early Magyars were the
direct descendants of two sons of Noah: Japhet and Cham. Those who
recorded the descent from Japhet claimed that Magog, the first king of
Scythia, was the namegiver of the Magyars.(35) The scholars holding
the second version say that the Magyars originated from Kush (Cush),
the dark complexioned offspring of Cham. While studying the
contradictory versions of the Magyars' ethnic origin, later chroniclers
stressed their own case more emphatically. The advocates of the
Japhetist descent underscore the fact that the Hungarians, being
white, could not have originated from Kush, who was a dark coloured
man.(36)
A similar controversy arose about the brothers Hunor and Magyar, the
direct forefathers of all Huns and all Magyars. At one time they were
said to have been the children of Menrot, the giant (an Egyptian?),
(37) who was a descendant of Japhet (the white) through Tana; and
at another, as the sons of Nemroth (Nimrod), a Babylonian,
descendant of Kush (the dark). The chroniclers did not consider the
possibility of a dual origin of the Nation, according to which the main



branch, the agriculturist white Magyars, would have absorbed a
notable number of dark-complexioned, mainly pastoral elements in
the earliest phase of their formation. The fusion of the said two ethnic
elements was first ascertained only later by De-seritzky (P 092 p.
179). Disregarding the above differences, there exists a general
agreement amongst our medieval historians that the Hungarians were a
very ancient people and the Scythians and Huns were closely related to
them and spoke the same language.
Where was the Old Fatherland located? Somewhere in the "Hot Zone"
(torrida zona), "where the climate is not temperate and where snakes
of all kinds, frogs as large as small pigs ( = tortoises), basilisks, many
venomous animals, also tigers and rhinoceroses are to be found." That
was a land where great quantities of gold and silver were mined and
many pearls discovered. It is unfortunate that the chroniclers did not
elaborate and that they omitted to give the name and the precise
location of this country. In the absence of precision, we can only rely
upon conjectures, concluding that the description given fits best to the
region west of the Red Sea, the S-form bend of the Nile where ancient
Nubia and Magaria were situated. There were the famous gold fields,
wherefrom the Egyptian Pharaohs obtained their enormous gold
supply and where all the tropical animals mentioned are common.
Giant tortoises are the typical creatures abounding in the Red Sea.
(38)
There are indications in the national chronicles which suggest that a
second old Hungarian fatherland may have existed, south of the
Caucasus, extending to the Mediterranean and including Syria,
Canaan and Asia Minor as well. It was in this same area that the
Hittite Empire had come into being, called the 'Land of Seven',
because it started with the unification of seven provinces governed by
as many princes. The chronicles mention that the same region has
been an old Hungarian fatherland. In fact, the chronicles say that "the



sons of Japhet / from whom the bulk of Hungarians originated /
owned the northern region in Cilicia and Syria, extending from the
Taurus and Amanus mountains to the river Don, which is already in
Scythia" (P 12G I p. 243 f.). We even have certain evidence of the
existence of a third Hungarian homeland which was situated in the
hinterland of the Babylonian Empire and included Upper
Mesopotamia and Caucasia. Our chroniclers believe that Nimrod
(Nemproth) was the first ruler of Babylon.
The making and the breaking-up of old Hungarian fatherlands was
usually accompanied by vast ethnic movements or 'migrations'. Their
direction was mostly northward and westward. In the national
recollection, the earliest recorded migration started in the desert
region of Dancalia (today: Danakil), between Somalia and Eritrea, and
proceeded northwards, bypassed Memphis and Babylon (today: Old
Cairo) and stopped for a while in Eiulath, at the end of the Gulf of
Aqaba (P 088 p. 17; P 120 I pp. 143-145; P 014 p. 167). The two
hunting heroes, Hunor and Magyar, who happened to be born in
Eiulath, later crossed the Caucasus and entered Scythia at the Marshes
of Maeotis (the present day Azov peninsula).
The Magyar chronicles are, of course, primarily interested in the
ethnic groups which moved westwards and eventually reached
Hungary. One such migration started from Troy in Asia Minor and
went through the Balkan peninsula. It was the people of Priamos, the
last king of Troy, who went that way after the fall of their city-state in
c. 1260 B.C. They settled in Hungary, near the great southward bend
of the Danube, where they built a stronghold called Sicambria. They
remained in the country for about four hundred years, when many of
them moved over to France, settling in the Paris region. They had fled
in panic fearing that other Oriental nations were already on their way
to the Danube basin (P 120 I p. 245).



The chronicle writers had preserved more details on a second
overland route, leading from the Orient to Hungary. It ran above the
Black Sea, through a large and open country called Scythia (the
present southern Russia). Although Scythia's climate was a healthy
one and favourable for the propagation of a human race, it was
nevertheless considered as a transit country only. This land was,
indeed, overcrowded with various peoples and had become more and
more insecure. As is known, the Hun-Hungarians were the first great
group to set out from there, marched westwards and were successful
in establishing a new empire in Central Europe, with its capital in
Hungary, near the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros. After the
collapse of their rule, they were followed by the Magyar-Hungarians,
whose group first concentrated in the Lower Don region, called
Dentu-Moger by Anonymus. Chronicler Kézai enlarges the territory of
the Hungarians in Scythia considerably, insofar as he includes the
Touranian Lowland around the Aral Sea and the Oxus river into it,
which he calls Magoria.
In short, these are the outlines of the image the Hungarians kept alive in
their collective memory of their origin, old fatherland, and wanderings.
We must feel a certain admiration when studying their records, all the
more so since modern historical science appears generally to support
their claims.

PART TWO
THE GENESIS OF THE
DANUBIAN HUNGARIANS
THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE HUNGARIANS



1. Implantation of the Higher Civilization into the Danubian basin
1. "Higher Civilization" is the comprehensive term for the major
material and spiritual innovations made by man during the Neolithic
and Bronze Ages. It signifies a settled way of life characterized by
food-production through agricultural activity and stock-breeding. In
view of the scarcity or total absence of contemporary written
evidences, this early period of human life is usually reconstructed with
the help of its material remains, whose study is archaeology. In the
following account, we frequently use another scientific term as well,
which is "historical Hungary". It means the unitary area of Central
Europe which is bounded on three sides — north, east and southeast
— by the Carpathian mountain ranges, in the south by the Low
Danube and the river Sava, and to the west by the first elevations of
the Alps (Fig. 1). After its principal mountain-range and principal
river, it is also known as the "Carpathian Land" and "Middle Danube
basin", or, more precisely, the "Carpatho-Danubian area". For over a
thousand years (until 1920), this area formed a single political entity,
the Kingdom of Hungary.
'Historical Hungary' is rich in archaeological remains. The most
significant finds which were made there until the mid-fifties, have
been described by Edith B. Thomas in her German language
Archaeologische Funde in Ungarn (P 125). Since that time the soil has
yielded so much valuable new material that this basic work needed to
be completed. The two most important complementary publications
are from Nándor Kalicz: Archaeology of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages
in Hungary, in Hungarian (P 074) and Neolithic Finds at Méhtelek (also
in H., P 075). The international connections of the Hungarian New
Stone Age have first been recognized by Gordon Childe in his
fundamental work The Danube in Prehistory (P 031), while the great
role the Middle Danube area played in spreading Higher Civilization
westward, has been summarized by Jacquetta Hawkes in several of



her comprehensive studies (P 064; P 065 and P 066). The excellent
maps of H. T. Waterbolk (P 134), showing the diffusion of food
production-methods, especially into Europe, are indispensable even
for the student of Hungarian archaeology. These publications may give
the reader a perfectly clear idea and up-to-date information about the
various archaeological aspects of early Hungary.
2. Neolithic agriculture found very favourable conditions in Hungary,
where it flourished rapidly, especially on the great Central Plain and
where mighty rivers — the Danube, Tisza, Maros and Körös — assure
abundant year-round water supply. Moreover, Hungary has extensive
loess soil, which is easily handled, even with primitive implements,
because it consists of very minute, windblown particles of high
capillarity. In addition to agriculture, breeding of domestic animals
(cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and dogs) played an important part in early
food-production. In this regard, a long-horned, Oriental cattle-race
deserves special mention because their descendants can be admired
even today in the Hortobágy National Park near Debrecen.
Manufacturing of pottery, spinning and weaving were the most
important industrial activities. Large vases were made for storage
purposes, smaller ones for every-day use, while ceramic statuettes and
other artistic products satisfied the needs of the Church. Timbered
houses above the ground and small, self-sufficient villages, as well as
incipient writing completed the Neolithic way of life in early Hungary.
There are over 200 known sites that bear testimony of the material
remains of Hungarian Higher Civilization. All were located on virgin
soil, i.e. they form the oldest layer in excavated sites. This is an
important fact because it indicates that there is no trace of previous
more primitive food-production in the Carpatho-Danubian area.
There, the Neolithic appears unprecedented and suddenly, in a fully
developed form. Consequently, this was not a phenomenon of local
origin but was caused by immigrants coming from another region.



The Neolithic Age began in Hungary in the fifth millenium B.C. It first
appeared along the Körös river, in the central part of the Great Plain,
hence its name: Körös culture. It remained the dominant neolithic
group for a period of over a thousand and five hundred years, until
about 3200 B.C. and has left lasting marks upon all subsequent,
similar Danubian cultures. The most sensational remains of the Körös
culture have come to light at Méhtelek in 1973. This tiny village is in
the Upper Szamos valley in an isolated location: about 200 km away
from the centre of this culture. This unique location is explained by
the presence of enormous quantities of obsidian, a very precious
industrial material during that epoch, for whose exploitation a whole
colony was set up. In order to fathom how important this exploitation
was, it is significant that the five pits which were open so far by
archaeologists yielded several thousand raw lumps and finished
wares, as compared with barely a hundred which were previously
inventoried for all of Hungary. Another surprise: nearly sixty Venus
statuettes were dug out in that area, as compared with a total of forty
that were previously discovered. No other such rich obsidian centre
has ever been found elsewhere in Europe (P 096 and P 075).
During the era of the Körös culture, Transdanubia and Upper Hungary
were covered with another neolithic culture, the so-called Danube-I,
radiocarbon-dated c. 4430 B.C. From its decorated pottery, it is also
known as Linear Pottery Culture, or Bandkeramik and its preference for
loess soil is particularly visible. A third major Hungarian neolithic
culture was the Banatian culture (c. 3200 B.C.-2300 B.C.), which
included the Transylvanian Olt basin (Erősd) and formed a link with
the more extensive Tripolje culture in Eastern Europe, famous for its
painted pottery. The fourth was the Tisza culture (c. 2800 B.C.-c. 2500
B.C.) which produced the finest and most valuable pottery. The fifth
or last one was the Péceli culture (c. 2100 B.C.-1900 B.C.). It already
covered the whole territory of Hungary and the Vienna and Moravian



basins as well.
Hungary's five neolithic cultures cover an uninterrupted period of over
two millenia and show a surprisingly high degree of uniformity over
the whole area. They have successfully incorporated almost all the
material and spiritual innovations of the world's first Higher Civilization
which flourished in the Ancient Near East, and became a secondary
centre of diffusion for the benefit of all central and north-western Europe.

3. Metal-using cultures appeared in Hungary in the middle of the IIIrd
millenium. The first period, from c. 2500 B.C., is characterized by an
abundant use of copper and gold; the second, from c. 1900 to 800
B.C. by its preference for bronze. Hungarian archaeologists therefore
like to speak of separate Copper and Bronze Ages, yet the two periods
constitute but a single one, bronze being an alloy of 90% copper with
10% tin or antimony. That Hungary was capable of developing a
brilliant metallurgy before any other European country is due to the
rich copper mines in her mountains, and the abundance of alluvial
gold deposited in the tributary streams of the Tisza.
A good illustration of Hungary's richness in precious metals at that
time is the gold plate of Mojgrád in Szilágy county (Fig. 25). It weighs
750 gr and reflects a neolithic pattern, insofar as only the eyes and the
nose are represented on it, while the mouth is omitted. The plate was,
in all probability, a sacred object whose brilliant face represented the
Sungod. It may have been the identification plate of a high priest
when officiating. The most distinctive Hungarian product was,
however, the hammer-axe, with a disc for the butt (Fig. 26). It was a
native form, derived from an earlier copper shaft-hole axe, this last
being the derivative of a stone axe. The metallurgic centres of
Hungary were so productive that they literally inundated
contemporary markets with their daggers, swords, spears, arrow



heads, goblets and bracelets. The proper evaluation of Hungary's
metallurgical activities, both in the Copper and Bronze Ages, can be
derived from Prof. Dawson's remarks, who summed up his findings
thus: "It is clear that during this period Hungary was the centre of a
brilliant development of culture which, from the artistic point of view,
surpassed anything that existed elsewhere in Central Europe... The
splendid Hungarian swords and axes, often ornamented with elaborate
spiral decorations, are perhaps the finest specimens of European bronze
work, and supplied the models for similar types of the Nordic Bronze
Age" (P 039 p. 326).

great demand in the Bronze Age.
4. As already pointed out, the neolithic way of life was not indigenous
to Hungary, but came from an outside geographic area. According to
our present knowledge, this can but be the Ancient Near-East, where
all the wild ancestors of domesticated plants and animals were
present and where food-production was achieved at an earlier date.
The accuracy of this fact has subsequently been proven with
comparative archaeology. Scholars of that study discovered, indeed, a
strong affinity, both in form and style, between the earliest Hungarian
artifacts and their Oriental counterparts. It was, in particular, noticed
that the Hungarian axes strongly resembled those found in the Royal
Cemetery of Ur, that Transylvanian sickles originated from



Mesopotamian forms and that the oldest Hungarian pottery was
similar to that found in the oldest layers of the ruins of Ur, Kish, Assur
and other ancient cities of Mesopotamia. Concordances found in the
Nile valley were just as convincing: long-horned Egyptian cattle,
native of the Delta, survives 3000 years later in the Hungarian
National Park of Hortobágy. In the same park, specimens can be seen
of a special breed of sheep with twisted horns, spread horizontally at
an angle of about 120 degrees, now called Racka. In ancient Egypt
these sheep were sacred to the God Khum, the ram-headed divinity.
This race has since become extinct there. In the grave of King
Hasekhe-mui of the Second Dynasty (c. 2703 B.C.-2686 B.C.) a gold
object was found, whose material may originally have come from
Hungary. It is indeed covered with a thin layer of antimony (Sb) and
tellurium (Te) which occur only in the gold of the Carpathian basin.
Another proof of the ancient Egypto-Hungarian connections is the
splendid jar found in Egyed, in Sopron county. The God Thot
recording the sins of the deceased is depicted on its sides.
The civilization of the ancient Near-East embraced not only
Mesopotamia and Egypt, which we just mentioned, but Syria and
Anatolia as well, with which countries the Carpatho-Danubian region
was already directly connected. Such contacts were numerous, as
shown by two enormous rapiers, over 90 cm in length, which were
found in the heart of Transylvania. They correspond exactly to the so
called Shardina-sword from Palestine (now in the British Museum).
There were also bracelets and beads made from Mediterranean shells.
Moreover, certain idols of Hungary are the exact duplicates of those
found on the Island of Cyprus (Élet és Tudomány, 1974 no. 38). The
Boghaz-Kői (Hittite) pottery designs from the XIVth century B.C. had
their duplicates in the Maros valley in Hungary. Hungarian gourd
shaped vessels were like Cappadocian specimens, while Hungarian
bronze jars found in Ózd near Miskolc, and elsewhere, were similar to



their Trojan prototypes from around 2100 B.C. And the gold plate
from Mojgrád shows a close resemblance to a similar figure from Troy
II. Thus Higher Civilization from the Orient reached Hungary
overland, through the Balkan corridor formed by the narrow valleys of
the Vardar and Morava rivers. This route was in use for over two
thousand years and its importance only began to decline after the fall
of Troy II, c. 1200 B.C. The route has been practically closed since the
Vllth century B.C.
In spite of the close links with its Oriental model, the Higher
Civilization of Hungary was not a simple copy of it, since it could
boast of several original features. One of the most important of these
was dry-farming. As a matter of fact, the Hungarian rivers, unlike
those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, had no regular floods. Therefore,
production by irrigation was not practised to a great extent here.
Instead, the Danubian farmers selected the windblown, porous loess
soil for cultivation, after having cleared it of its small growth. Later,
with the appearance of metallic tools and other more efficacious
agricultural implements (plough), it was possible to include heavier
but better clay soil as well into the cultivated area. Thanks to this and
to similar inventions, Danubian farmers were highly superior in
production to those on the Balkans, including Greece. The adaptation
to European environment was a significant innovation; it opened the
door for Hungarian farmers to spread out westwards, into Central and
Western Europe.
Besides the Danubian Neolithic, early Europe possessed two other
neolithic cultures: the Tripolje or Black Earth culture, with its painted
pottery, and the Lake Dwelling culture in Switzerland. The first one
unfolded in Eastern Europe, between the Dnieper and the Low
Danube. Its exact origin is still unknown, although it is certain that it
owed its existence to the same source that gave rise to the Danubian
neolithic civilization. The Tripolje culture disappeared, however, quite



soon after the so-called Battle-axe people appeared, whereas the Lake
Dwelling, on account of its very special conditions, could not be
introduced elsewhere. As a result, the Hungarian or Danubian
neolithic culture remained without rival in central and western
Europe. This privileged situation explains its lasting influence over
vast areas for about two thousand years. The westward extension of
the Danubian civilization proceeded along the Danube and its
interconnections on the one hand, and along the Vistula and Oder on
the other. In the words of Prof. G. Childe: "for over two thousand years
it (the Danube) formed the channel by which the influence of the Higher
Civilization of the Eastern Mediterranean basin, including Anatolia and
Syria, was transmitted to the barbarian North and even to distant
Britain" (P 073 p. 413).(40)
2. The advent of the first sedentary population
1. In the two thousand years immediately preceding the Neolithic Age
from c. 5500 B.C. to 3500 B.C., neither the Middle Danube basin nor
Central Europe in general had any permanent population (P 134).
This fact excludes the possibility that the Danubian cultural and
technical upswing might have been the result of borrowing through
commercial contacts, no one being present at the receiving end. It is
therefore generally assumed that the introduction of the Higher
Civilization in the Carpatho-Danubian area was the work of actual
colonization by immigrant farmers and metal workers.
In fact, the first colonists began to reach Hungary immediately after
the climatic change, in the so-called Subboreal Period. During that
period the average rainfall was less than today, and the yearly
temperature was 7°C above the present average. With the increasing
dryness, dense forests thinned out, marshes shrank to a smaller size or
even disappeared, more room becoming available for ethnic
movements. The Vardar-Morava corridor, which cuts the Balkans right



in half, opened up and funnelled migrant groups of cultivators and
herdsmen in an ever increasing number into Hungary. The bulk of
migrants came from the western parts of the Ancient Near East: from
Syria and Anatolia, although the original point of departure of many of
them was Mesopotamia and Egypt.
The described ethnic movement can best be followed with the study of
old place-names, the 'toponymy'. Its usefulness for detecting ethnic
movements stems from the general human behaviour that immigrants,
as soon as they settle in a free place, give names to the surrounding
geographic features. When correctly interpreted, these names may
disclose the geographic origin of the first colonists, the time of their
arrival, the state of their civilization, their language, their ethnic
appurtenance, and even the area of colonization in the new land. For
all these advantages, toponymy has become one of the most
productive subsidiary branches of history; it may open "dazzling
perspectives," — as the French linguist Albert Dauzat expressed it (P
037 p. 70). The historical interpretation of place-names needs,
however, a very careful analysis, because they were themselves subject
to phonetical distortions, following the various sound-shifts, the vowel
harmony and the shifting of accent. Therefore the first task of the
toponymist consists of elucidating the oldest spelling of a given place
name, which usually conserves the original meaning of the name most
clearly. In this respect, however, the effective contribution of
Hungarian linguists to our knowledge in this particular field was, until
recently inadequate, due to their rather conservative frame of mind
(cf. P 009 p. 56 f.). Under these circumstances, this author had to
supply the basic documentation for this chapter.
2. A first group of Hungarian place-names, throwing light upon the
geographic origin of her inhabitants, includes such names that are
identical to those of their previous dwelling places. The immigrants,
indeed, make use of the same vocabulary in christening, to which they



were accustomed. This habit is verifiable even in our days, and it
explains why we have so many 'London', 'Paris', 'Athens' and other
European names in America, duplicating the toponymy of their former
country. In a similar way, there is, in Hungary, a series of place-names
which are repetitive to those of Anatolia, Syria, Mesopotamia and
Egypt. Let us quote a few such names. First, the name of Troy (anc.
Turia), in western Anatolia, also occurs in Hungary as Torja and Tiirje.
The name of Arzawa in southern Anatolia is duplicated in southern
Hungary as Orsova. The Phoenician city of Arad has its Hungarian
namesake in the great city of Arad. Two Hungarian villages called
Haláp (located in the counties of Zala and Bihar) correspond to the
important city of Haleb (today: Aleppo). The Syrian Bukk valley has its
namesake in Hungary in the Bükk mountain and Bükk town. The
Palestinian Pilis country or Pilis-Ta is identical to the Hungarian Pilis
name, used as a county, mountain and village name. The Palestinian
river Kishont also re-appears in Hungary in the same form as Kishont,
a county-name.
The list of similar place-names continues with Egyptian and
Mesopotamian names. Ancien Egypt had a border-land called Zala or
Sala. It was a marshy region in the north-eastern Delta, where a
fortress was located to guard the military road to Syria. The same
name occurs in Hungary, in both forms as Zala and Sala, a county
which formerly resembled a marshy border-land in its southern parts.
Egypt's Nitra is duplicated in Hungary with Nyitra (anc. Nitra) as a
county, city and river name. The southern part of the Sinai peninsula,
under Egyptian rule since the unification of the "Two Lands" in c. 3200
B.C., was known as Bakon; its Hungarian homonym is also Bakony, a
forested area to the northwest of the Balaton Lake. Even Egyptian
king-names were used as Hungarian place-names, so that Tata, Papa
and Menes are Tata, Pápa, Ménes, Ménfő, Ménfa.
There are several duplicates of the Mesopotamian river names in



Hungary. E. g. Kherka and Sajur, both tributaries of the Tigris, appear
in Hungary as Kerka and Sajó. The Mesopotamian native name of the
land beyond the river Euphrates was Burattu; its Hungarian
equivalent is Berettyó. The Hungarian Karas, Körös and Krassó
correspond to the Mesopotamian Karasu. Finally, northern
Mesopotamia was called Subaru and Subartu to which the Hungarian
Szabar village-names in the Vas, Györ and Nógrád counties
correspond, as well as Sabaria, the capital city of former Pannónia.
Such parallels are not merely coincidental, since certain Arab
historical sources mention that the Hungarians were formerly called
by the ethnic name Sabartoi-Asphaloi.
A second series of Near-Eastern — Hungarian common place-names
are those that contain the name of an Oriental pagan divinity. We have
already mentioned some of them in a previous chapter dealing with
mythology. So it suffices here to remind the reader that the most
frequent divine names in question are the Sungod's various names,
such as 'lord' {Ur, Ra); 'Eye God' {Szemes); 'Sky God' (Ég-Ur); 'The
Enthroned God' (Szék-Ur); 'Heavenly Horse' {Égi Ló). The second
popular pagan divinity whose name is used in Hungarian place-names
is Bál (Baal), the Syrian Fire God. Places bearing the name of this god
are most frequent in the southern half of the country, in the Balaton
Lake area and in Transylvania. This regrouping suggests that the Baal
worshipping colonists may have arrived after the Sun-worshippers.
The third most frequently occurring divinity name was that of the God
Thot, protector of arts and letters in Egypt. Finally, a third series of
Hungarian place-names of Near Eastern origin are those which are
formed with Oriental ethnic or tribal names. These are e.g. Hetés or
Hetis, meaning 'Seven Ancestors' and Hetény, recalling the descendants
of the Hittites, who were led by exactly seven (Héth) princes. Another
Oriental ethnic name is Pilis, which was already mentioned. These
three series of specific Hungarian place-names — duplicating names,



divine names and ethnic names — prove that ancient Hungary received
the greater part of its first permanent population from the Ancient Near
East during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. The first wave was made up
mostly of agriculturists coming into the Carpatho-Danubian area
through the Balkan corridor of the Vardar-Morava valleys.
3. Having clarified the geographic origin of Hungary's first sedentary
population, our attention will be focussed next upon their territorial
expansion in the land. Our research in this connection is based partly
upon the three series of place-names just discussed, and partly upon
place-names which include one of the following six Old Hungarian
formative suffixes denoting dwelling places: 1. Ta (variant: Da)
meaning 'Land'; 2. Hon (var. On, An, Ony) 'Home'; 3. Szék (var. Szeg,
Szik) 'Residence'; 4. Kö (var. Ka, Ke, Kev) literally 'Stone', also 'Village';
5. Pis (>Biz, Viz) 'Water'; and 6. Mat (var. Ma, Mad, Mata) 'Field'.
Proof of the great antiquity of these six formative suffixes is the fact
that today they are no longer used for name-giving purposes, that they
are common in the entire Finno-Ugric language group and that the
words in question were in continuous use in the Ancient Orient since
the IIIrd millenium B.C. at least.
We begin our illustration with the word Ta. It occurs in the following
Near Eastern place-names: Pilis-Ta, Heti-Ta, Cre-Ta, Kushi-Ta, Subar
Tu, Urar-Tu, etc. In European Hungary the following names are
formed with the same element: Ágo-Ta, Bago-Ta, Bak-Ta, Bó-Ta,
Bucsu-Ta, Cinko-Ta, Csaj-Ta, Csász-Ta, Galán-Ta, Ino-Ta, Kádár-Ta,
Kalo-Ta, Laj-Ta, Panko-Ta, Pilis-Ta, Pusz-Ta; further: Ab-Da, An-Da, Or
Da, Ra-Da, Tor-Da, Var-Da. The suffix Hon (frequently without the first
letter, H) was also common in place-names both in the Near East as
well as in Hungary. In the Orient the most widely known such names
are: Ir-An (<Ur-Hon), Tour-An (<Tó-Ur-Hon), Makr-An (< Magyar
Hon), and Macar-On ( = Magyar Hon); and in Hungary: Bak-On, Bak
Ony, Balat-On (<Bál-Ott-Hon), Mos-Ony, etc. Place-names to which



the formative suffix Szék is added are: Bakony-Szeg, Báta-Szék, Bor
Szék, Bükk-Szék, Eger-Szeg (<Ég Ur Széke), E-Szék (< Ó-Szék),
Fehér-Szék, Három-Szék, Kis-Szék, Kö-Szeg, Róna-Szék, Szi-Szek, and
Szék-Ács, Szek-Szárd, etc. With Kö: Barát-Ka, Szabad-Ka, Pát-Ka,
Dobo-Ka, Raj-Ka, Resz-Ke (< Réz-Kö), Pisz-Ke, Bél-Kö, Kö-Szeg.
Names with Pis: Danu-Bis, Ti-Bis, Cola-Pis (the medieval form of the
present Kulpa), Fischa (< Pis); and the dwelling names Pis-Ki, Pis-Kö,
Pis-Káros, Pisz-Ke, Pozsony (< Pis-Hon), Pös-Tyén. And finally place
names in Hungary with Mat: Doz-Mat, Dai-Mat, Ko-Mádi, Kecske-Mét,
Madi, Máta, Modor.
After having selected, by the above-mentioned method, all the eligible
place-names of Oriental origin — over 2,000 names — from the
Directory of Hungarian place-names (P 094 and P 095), and located on
a map showing the 63 counties of Hungary, the following statistics

the first permanent population of the Carpatho-Danubian basin was not
spread out evenly over the whole country. It concentrated upon two
major areas: 1. Transdanubia, with prolongations northwards into the
Vag valley and southwards into the Drava and Sava regions; and 2.
Transylvania with extensions into the valleys of the right-bank
tributaries of the Tisza. The two areas were separated from one another
by sparsely populated, marshy zones. Thus, as far as the degree of
civilization and geographic conditions allowed it, the land was already
filled to capacity in the Bronze Age (c. 1900 B.C.) by a permanent,
mostly agricultural population. The areas that were still available for
future migrants consisted of flooded and mountainous regions, excellent
places for pastoral population that soon came wave after wave.

end of the Bronze Age (squares indicate the most densely settled
areas).
3. The identity of the first settlers
The reader has no doubt noticed that most of the old place-names
which were handed down by the first population of the Carpatho



Danubian area had some definite meaning in Hungarian. This fact
suggests that they probably spoke Hungarian. This question shall now
be analysed in more detail.
The archaeological remains of the epoch allow us to distinguish the
presence of three closely related but different ethnic groups. The
largest one was made up of farmers, usually referred to as Magari
(Magyars) or Ari (Aryans). The second largest consisted of those
engaged in animal husbandry, and were called Siculi, Sikeloi
(Székely), while the third and smallest group were pastoralist people,
an occupation frequently connected with the Kush. The following
explanations support the threefold division, based upon the respective
economic activity.
1. That the Danubian farmers were Aryans and first practised their
trade all over Central Europe, was first noticed by L.A. Waddell, who
stated that "the Aryans were the forerunners of the agricultural stage
in the world's civilization" (P 132 p. 49). That these farmers were
MagAri, or Magyars, appears from the analysis of the Magyar name
itself, whose etymological meaning is, strictly speaking, 'farmer'. It
was used, and still continues to be in that sense, both in Hungary and
its neighbouring countries. In Hungarian, indeed, a 'farmstead' was
Major (pron. Moyor), and in the Austro-Bavarian German dialect, the
word for 'peasant' is similarly Mayer and Meyer. Farther west in
Germany, however, the common word for the same term is 'Bauer'.
In addition to the semantic connection of 'agriculturist' with the
Magyar name, there is much evidence suggesting that the bulk of the
Neolithic and Bronze Age inhabitants were really Magyars. Such
evidence includes the ethnic symbols, with which they identified
themselves in pictorial writing. The most widely used ones were: (1)
the bird (Madár), because it sounded like Magyar; (2) the lion, which
was Magaru (= Magyar) in Sumerian-Hungarian; and (3) a bee



(Méh), which combined with the wearer (Ur) formed the symbol
Mehar, which also sounded like Magyar. The role of the first two
symbols as Magyar ethnic identification badges was already discussed,
therefore there is no need to return to this subject. For the use of the
bee-symbol, however, we mention two instances: first, that the famous
neolithic obsidian factory was operating in Hungary at Méh-Telek, i.e.
on a 'Bee-Plot' and secondly that Herodotus records that in the
Carpatho-Danubian region there are great multitudes of 'bees', so that
it is impossible to visit that land (P 067 Book V cap. 10).
At this point we wish to introduce a unique statuette as well, found in
a site of the neolithic Tisza-culture (Fig. 23). It represents the harvest
divinity, holding a sickle in his right hand, an implement whose form
is the wellknown abbreviation in the Hungarian carved script for Isten
'God'. The statuette in question belongs to the category of the so
called 'talking statues', because its posture coveys a message (P 074 p.
21). We can read it by naming its conspicuous elements one after
another: the clenched hand (MArok), the arms in the plural KAR.ok,
the face AR, and the belt RA. These elements identify the God as being
Isten, MA-KAR.ok Ura 'God, Lord of the Magyars'. The ancient Egyptian
kings, who were also considered earthly deputies for God, were
frequently represented in exactly the same posture, as for instance
King Ramses II, whose image is shown above (Fig. 22). The strong
Egypto-Hungarian relations, which are apparent even here, do not
surprise us for all three major Magyar ethnic symbols originated there.
In ancient Egypt, the bird was the paramount divine symbol, the lion
usually accompanied the royal image, while the bee in the royal
cartouche was used to render the king's title as ruler of Lower Egypt.
This suffices to conclude that the bulk of the first sedentary population
of Old Hungary consisted of Hungarian-speaking, agricultural Magyars.
These early settlers transplanted Egyptian agricultural know-how,
tradition and mentality into the Middle Danube basin.



2. Hungary's next most numerous people of the Bronze Age, known by
name, were the Siculi or Sikeloi inhabitants, whose descendants are
called Székely (pron. Sakaly). They form a solid block of two and a
half million Magyar-tongued inhabitants in the heart of Transylvania,
the eastern province of historical Hungary. Their admirable folklore is
their most characteristic ethnic feature and is fully permeated with the
old solar cult. The visible image of their pre-Christian divinity, the
Sundisc, is usually displayed in their coat of arms, together with the
waxing Moon and the eight-pointed star. They are identical to those
seen on ancient Mesopotamian documents. The Siculi believed their
God was a human shaped giant, riding on a horse or in a brilliant
chariot in the sky. All the words used by the Siculi in connection with
the said idea-complex — Sun, Sky, Horse, Chariot, Way, Seat and so
on — belong to the oldest layer of the Hungarian vocabulary. The
etymological meaning of their name is also Hungarian, and
corresponds to their intimate religious life. Sikeloi is, indeed, a
compound with the following elements: S-IKE-LO-I, which would be
spelt today Az Égi Ló-i, meaning 'Follower of the Celestial Horse' or,
more plainly, 'Believer in Sungod'.
The Siculi or Sikeloi always played a significant part in Hungary's
history. Prior to their alliance with Prince Arpad, they were allies of
the Hun-Hungarians, in the Kingdom of Attila, according to our
national Annals (P 120 I p. 101). They also took part in the decisive
battle which brought about the downfall of the Hun Empire. Three
thousand Siculi cavalry-men managed somehow to escape from the
bloody battle and went into hiding in the unidentified Chigla-Field,
waiting for the return of "other" Hungarians (usque ad aliorum
Hungarorum reditum, P 120 I p. 279). As a matter of fact, when they
found out, at the end of the IXth century, that a new Magyar group
was on the way to Hungary under the leadership of Prince Arpad, the
Siculi horsemen, who had been living in the land for a long time,



galloped to the Carpathian passes to great their brethren. Then,
according to their agreement, they helped unify the land into a single
dominion. From that moment on, the fate of the Siculi merged with
that of the Arpad Hungarians.
During the reign of King Attila, the bulk of the Siculi-Hungarians still
dwelt in the western borders of the Carpathian land: in Upper
Hungary and in Transdanubia. They were the stockbreeders of the
epoch, belonging to a semi-military organization in charge of the
defence of the western boundaries of the Hun Empire. They were
directed by chiefs called Lófö, literally 'Great men', a title equivalent to
the medieval marquis. After the Hun-era, when the disintegrated
country was re-united by Prince Arpad and the Nation was converted
to the Christian faith, the eastern borders of the land became the most
sensitive ones. Therefore, the first Magyar kings transferred the Siculi
frontier-guards from Upper Hungary into Transylvania for further
duties. This displacement is evidenced by a series of medieval charters
and more recently by a toponymic study showing that 36 village
names of Transylvania are the exact duplicate of as many Upper
Hungarian place-names (Magyar Múlt, Sidney, 1977 no. 2). The
Transdanubian Siculi, who were not involved in the massive transfer,
remained in their original location in the West. Their long stay here
explains the surprisingly high number of solar place-names, especially
in Zala county, and also the existence of certain common dialectal
particularities between the Transylvanian and the Transdanubian
populations of today.
The fact that the Siculi's first places of habitation were in the western
parts of historical Hungary, suggests that they may have entered into
the land via the Adriatic Sea. The probability of this itinerary is
dramatically confirmed by the presence of other Siculi on the western
side of the Adriatic, namely on the Italian peninsula. This fact also
suggests a simultaneous arrival into both lands in question, around



the XIth century B.C. (cf. P 100 'Sicel'). That the Italian Siculi formed
the integral part of the great Siculi migration is further evidenced by
the fact that they too were led by chiefs called Syc-Lo-Pe and Laes-Turi
Gones, as reported by Thukydides in a distorted form (P 126 Book VI
cap. 18). These terms would be, in the more correct spelling, Sikel Ló
Fö (after the P > F soundshift in Lo-Pe),meaning 'Siculi Great Men';
and Lovas Túri Honös 'Mounted Trojan Ancestor' respectively.(41)
Another significant detail: one of the Siculi kings, Italus by name,
became the namegiver of the whole Peninsula, and also of the present
Italian nation.(42)
The Siculi in Italy were not numerous enough to keep the whole
peninsula for themselves. Actually, they were driven out therefrom
around 1035 B.C., when the majority of them crossed over to the
island of Sicily and forced the earlier inhabitants to retreat into its
western parts while they occupied all the rest of the land, changing its
name to 'Sicilia'. They lived in peace on the island about three
hundred years, until the Hellens began to drive them out. In the VIth
century B.C., the Sicilians were defeated in battle and their separate
national identity was gradually dissolved, — according to Thukydides.
Outside of Hungary and Italy, numerous Siculi tribes were also to be
found in the northwestern Punjab (India). They were locally known as
Sakai or Sakae (P 044 'Sakai'), the same as the Hungarian Székely.
These Hindu-Sikeli were also followers of the Sungod, calling him
Sacra (< Az Ég Ura) 'Lord of the Sky'. His female associate was Sacra
Ni (H.: Sacra Neje) 'Wife of the Heavenly Lord'. All the Hindu Sikeli
were engaged in animal husbandry. To sum up, the Siculi were a widely
diffused ancient race of the Ilnd and 1st millen-iums B.C. One of their
branches became, together with their Magyar brethren, the founders of
European Hungary, as seen from an ethnic standpoint.
3. Traces of a third people are also discernible in the Neolithic and



Bronze Ages in Hungary. They originated from the Kush or Cushan
folk, usually referred to in the scientific language as Mediterraneans
or Dinarians without, however, sufficiently emphasizing their
characteristic brownish complexion. The Kush race was first identified
in Eastern Africa, around the Great Lakes. It was also a widely
diffused old race, but broken up into a multitude of smaller or larger
ethnic entities that lacked any comprehensive political organisation
for a long time. They were the first great historical people to send out
colonists into southwest Asia and into Europe, including Hungary.
The European branch of the Kush seems to have spoken the
Hungarian language: whether through origin or by assimilation, is not
yet clear. At any rate, all their identifying symbols are Hungarian. The
most widely used such symbol was the ram: it accompanied them
through all their wanderings, in Egypt, Hungary, as well as in India
and Touran. Ram in Hungarian is Kos (pron. Kush), which was also
their national name. Their rulers, both terrestrial and divine, were
called Fö-Kos, 'The Principal Kush', and his distinctive symbol was a
kind of spontoon, called Fokos in Hungarian, a word that sounds like
their name. Kristóf Lukácsy, a distinguished Hungarian historian of the
XlXth century, was positively convinced that the language of the Kush
was Hungarian, even while they were still sojourning in the Oxus
region of Touran (P 092 p. 85).
The early presence of the Kush in Hungary is evidenced by a ram
headed altar found in a neolithic layer near Szeged. And the last
notable group of them lived in Upper Hungary, during the reign of
King St. Stephen (1000-1038). Their district was known as 'Dark
Hungary' (Ungaria Nigra), as opposed to 'White Hungary' (Ungaria
Alba), so called after the skin colour of the respective inhabitants.
With the conversion to Christendom, the cohesive force of the Kush
was broken and the people was absorbed into the majority. Their
memory still lingers in such place-names as Kosd (< Kush-Ta), Kosna



(< Kos Hona), Kustán (< Kus Tanya) and the family name of Kós.
To complete the presentation of the European Kush, we must also
mention that classical and medieval historical sources inform us that
both Britain and France have a considerable number of Kush absorbed
in their national body, who were locally called Picti (P 132 pp. 111
126 and P 065 p. 394). The Romans believed that they were so called,
because their faces were "painted", as the Latin word Pictus suggests.
This view is, however, unacceptable because the Kush were already
dark by birth and were called black well before the existence of the
Latin language. The key to the solution lies in the Hungarian
language, in which black is Fekete, whose old Hungarian form had
been Pekete, Pekte, prior to the P > F soudshift. Consequently the
oeiginal signification of the local name of the West European Kush
simply meant 'dark' and not 'painted.' Another local name of the dark
people in the British Isles was Cassi, from whom the Scots originated.
All the details listed above, when combined into a whole, are decisive
proof that the earliest inhabitants of the Carpatho-Danubian area were
Hungarians: variously known as agriculturist Magyars, stock-breeding
Siculi-Székely, and darkish coloured pastoral Kush. In other words the
present-day Hungarians seem to be direct descendants of the first
inhabitants of the land who lived there four thousand years ago.
4. The testimony of the Tatárlaki (Tartaria) tablets
1. The first inhabitants of the Carpatho-Danubian area have
bequeathed us with decisive historical evidence of their ethnic and
linguistic identity, in three inscribed clay tablets found at Tatárlaki
(now Tartaria), near the river Maros, in 1961 (Fig. 28). They turned
up in a mound barely measuring 240 m X 100 m. One of the tablets is
a roundel with a hole, while the two others are rectangular. The larger
rectangular one also has a hole, but the smaller one only bears the



picture of a horned goat. All three tablets appear to have been locally
made, while the accompanying objects come from the Mediterranean
and were either Cretan or Cycladic. The tablets aroused world-wide
interest, because they gave scholars a concrete chance of identifying
the language spoken by the earliest population of the Carpatho
Danubian basin.
Our inquiry about the tablets in question requires an answer to the
following three questions: (1) for which purpose were the tablets
made? (2) what message is written upon them? and (3) to which
historical period do they belong? Amongst the multitude of studies
already devoted to clearing up the mystery of these written
documents found on the soil of ancient Hungary, the most valuable is
that of Prof. M.S.F. Hood (USA) even though he failed to discover the
purpose of the tablets and denied that there was actual writing in the
signs carved upon the pieces.(43) Concerning the age of the tablets,
there were two opinions. The first emphasizes the Mesopotamian
character of the writing and, on that basis, suggests that the tablets
may have been made in the Uruk-period, somewhere around 3000
B.C. The second opinion, that of Prof. Hood, insists upon their Cretan
parallels and upon their Aegean and Anatolian connections in general.
Accordingly, the holder of this second view assigns a considerably
later period to the objects and suggests that they may have been made
between 2000 B.C. and 1700 B.C. Since then, no new judgements
have been formulated so that the mystery of the Tatárlaki tablets
continues to remain unsolved, more than twenty years after their
discovery.






Fig. 28. The world-famous Tatárlaki (Tartaria) clay tablets, found
near the river Maros. They were used for the purpose of solar
observations.
2. In our procedure of trying to find the secret of the Tatárlaki tablets,
we must first ascertain the purpose for which they were made. This
inquiry begins with the etymology of Tatárlaki, the name of the village
where they were discovered. It is a Hungarian compound, whose last
element (-Laka) means a detached, small cottage, literally 'the
dwelling of. But the first part of the name (Tatár) cannot be
interpreted as having been the dwelling of some Tartarian person,
because Tartars never lived in Hungary, particularly not in pre
Christian times. The full name in question is actually made up with
the following elements: Tat-Ár-Lak-a, the vocalized form of an original
deeper sounding Tót-Ur-Lak-a, with the literal meaning of 'God Thot's
Cottage'. That makes sense, because God Thot was an important
Egyptian divinity: patron of writing and reckoning, who was also in
charge of measuring time and doing solar observations for the
purpose of calendar making. In that perspective it seems logical to
conjecture, that the Tatárlaki tablets themselves may have been used
for solar observations and, ultimately, for setting up calendars.(44)



This conclusion is supported by other, circumstantial evidence.
To begin with, the plot where the find was made is a small one,
inadequate for farming. It was, however, large enough to make
astronomical observations, especially during the summer. Then, the
picture of a crab and a horned goat, engraved upon the tablets, is
further evidence supporting this idea. The same animals, indeed, are
part of the Zodiac, the crab being the symbol of the Cancer
constellation, and the horned goat that of the Capricorn. Moreover,
the circular hole appearing both on the roundel and upon the larger
rectangle must have been connected with celestial observations,
because this latter hole is surrounded by sunbeams to show,
unequivocally, that the rising Sun is meant thereby. Finally, the most
conspicuous details of the roundel supply us with the decisive word:
Calendar. In fact, the circular hole represents the Sun, in Hungarian
NAP, the giant cross intersecting the roundel carries the sound-value of
T, and the circular rim of the object supplies the final constituent AR.
These sounds, put together, give the word Nap-T-Ár, Naptár, which is
the Hungarian word for 'Calendar'. It seems thus certain that the
Tatárlaki tablets were components of a sophisticated solar observatory,
and were used for determining time.(45)
3. Before proceeding to our next task, i.e. deciphering the script
engraved upon the tablets, we must take a glimpse into the
astronomical thinking of Antiquity. At that time, the Sun was
considered a human-shaped divinity always on the move in the sky,
following a fixed yearly path, during which it bypasses 12 important
stations or groups of conspicuous stars called constellations. Several of
these groups appear before the eyes of observers, as shaping celestial
animals. Hence their names: Aries, Crab, Lion, Capricorn and so on.
All together, these animals form the 'Animal belt' or Zodiac. The
Zodiacal constellations were closely watched by ancient astronomers,
because they were suitable phenomena for measuring time. Certain



ones heralded the beginning of the seasons on a fixed day: Spring
(March 21), Summer (June 22), Autumn (September 23) and Winter
(December 22). In the northern hemisphere, the constellation that
could be observed most easily, was the one which signaled the
beginning of Summer. Daylight lasts longest on that day, when the
Sun ceases to ascend higher on the horizon, and begins its downward
course. This change of direction takes 11 days, during which the Sun
rises every morning at the same time and on the same point of the
horizon, as if it had stopped moving. So much suffices to understand
the sense of the message upon the roundel, to which we now return.
The sound-signs appearing on the round tablet are, in our opinion,
not Sumerian picture-signs, but more advanced carved signs. Most of
them correspond to Old Hungarian writing signs (see Fig. 14). The
only major difference the Tatárlaki tablets display vs. the Old
Hungarian letters lies in their outward appearance: the Tatárlaki
writing has a marked preference for linking signs together into bizarre
geometric shapes. The very close resemblance of the Tatárlaki signs to
the Old Hungarian ones invites us to try to read the mysterious
message in Hungarian, beginning with the roundel, according to our
Fig. 29, whereon the signs are separated into words.
Fig. 29. The sound-signs of the Tatárlaki tablets, separated into
words.



The first part of the message is placed in the upper half of the object
in question. It reads from left to right and the signs are transliterated
as follows: eZ. iR-áNY-O(n) J.öN eS.T.eN. 4. 05
Ó-Ra.K.oR. With present spelling: Ez irányon jön Isten 4.05 órakor, in
literal translation: 'God comes (= the Sun rises) in this direction at
4:05 o'clock.' The second part of the message, inscribed on the lover
half the roundel, reads in the reverse direction, from right to left, as is
indicated by the so-called turning letters, specially N, R and K. It runs
thus: ELE.RE aR.áK. S.iL.oK ég.ö-Ve.Be(n) 5 + 5 + eGY (= 11)
É.Ta.K-áN, in present spelling: Előre a rák csillag égövében 11 éjszakán
'Beforehand the Crab is twinkling in its celestial zone for 11 nights.'
Is our reading reliable? It is, when considering the following. First, the
decipherment produced a coherent and closely reasoned message, in
which all the written signs appear with their own sound-value. This
fact alone is usually considered as sufficient proof for the correct
reading. Secondly, the message uses a highly technical language,
according to the time and circumstances, which we can however
understand, since we already know the fundamentals of ancient
mentality. Besides, it follows the golden rule of the well written
ancient inscriptions, inasmuch as it uses seven words — not less, nor
more — in both sentences. Finally, all statements referred to in the
inscription are accurate, and all have been confirmed, since then, by
modern science. In fact, on the first day of Summer (June 22), the Sun
rises at Tatárlaki, on the 46th parallel, exactly at five minutes past four
o'clock.
Our next problem is to decipher the message inscribed upon the larger
rectangular tablet. It is divided into three compartments. We are, alas,
unable to make out the meaning of the signs placed into the first
compartment; but the remaining part is clear enough and says: 'Here
the Sun rises in the Cancer (constellation) on the day of...' (missing



sign?).(46)
The smaller rectangle has no carved script scratched upon its surface,
nor a hole to let the sunbeams penetrate into the observatory room.
On its surface is a horned goat with an eleven-branched tail, symbol of
the Capricorn constellation which announces the beginning of Winter.
Behind the goat, the outlines of a roaring animal are discernible,
probably that of the celestial dog, urging the Sun to ascend on its
brilliant way again. That the goat's picture holds for the Sun, is
evidenced by its having five legs, five being the sacred number of the
solar divinity. To make a hole on this tablet would have been useless,
because in winter the sky is usually overcast in Tatárlaki, and no
astronomical observations can be made.
4. The last question in connection with the Tatárlaki tablets deals with
the setting of the approximate date when the tablets could have been
in use for solar observations. Prof. Hood approached this question by
comparing the tablets with similar archaeological remains found at
Knossos in Crete and concluded that the Tatárlaki tablets cannot be
older than their Cretan variants, i.e. not older than c. 1900 B.C.
Therefore, he added, if the solar equipment in question has been
found in a neolithic layer, that could only have happened if the pit in
which it was found had been dug from a higher archaeological level.
Our own estimation, based upon the history of writing, supports the
opinion of Prof. Hood all the more, because certain dating terms, such
as "eleven times", appear on the similar Cretan tablets as well. Since,
however, the writing on the Tatárlaki tablets is more mature, a
younger age would be more suitable for them. This age can be
determined through a mathematical operation, by converting the
sidereal time given in the inscription, into our present time-computing
system, taking into consideration the phenomenon of precession. This
term designates the specific rotation of the Earth's axis which causes
the beginning of the various seasons not to always occur in the same



group of stars (constellation), nor on the same day. The vernal point
actually advances upon the ecliptic at a rate of one day in every 72
years. Therefore, after a shift of 30 days, i.e. 2160 years (= 30 X 72),
the sunrise will already occur in another constellation. The Tatárlaki
tablets report that the Sun's descending course happened on the
eleventh day of the Cancer constellation. On the other hand we also
know that the Cancer constellation lasted from c. 2220 B.C. to c. 60
B.C. (P 118 p. 78). Thus, its approximative age results from the
mathematical operation: B.C. 2220 minus 11 X 72, that is 1428 B.C.
As it disclosed, the Tatárlaki inscriptions constitute decisive historical
evidence, whereby it becomes clear that the first permanent population
of the Carpatho-Danubian basin spoke Hungarian and that their leaders
had highly sophisticated knowledge. That Hungarians were in evidence
in Central Europe considerably earlier than was theretofore believed, is a
fact which obliges us to substantially modify our historical conceptions
about the peoples of Europe in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages

THE SCYTHIAN HUNGARIANS
1. Their origin and civilization
The history of the Scythians is so complicated and forms such a
tangled skein of varied problems — says A. L. Mongait — that, in spite
of abundant sources for its study, "the Scythian problem remains an
intransigent subject, that is still far from settled" (P 097 bis p. 153). At
one time the Scythians are said to be Indo-Europeans, on the basis of
the similitude of their language; at another, they are considered Huns,
with whom they shared their cultural features. Elsewhere, it is
maintained that they belonged to the Hungarian-speaking group of
peoples (Uralo-Altaians), with whom they were closely linked
throughout their history, both in the Orient and the Occident. All these
opinions circulate freely, since nobody has, as yet, correctly analysed
the Scythian tongue, nor deciphered any of their written messages.
What is definitely known about the Scythians, however, is that they
did not all live in a single political structure, but were broken up into
several political entities, with as many individual ethnic
denominations. The lack of political unity of the Scythians could not,
however, conceal their close affinities: they all spoke the same
language, had the same solar cult, the same civilization and "were linked
by some sort of racial tie" (P 123 p. 42).
Their original homeland, or more precisely, the geographic area where
history first detected them, was the northern hinterland of
Mesopotamia and Syria. From these regions they were gradually
squeezed out by the continuous razzias of the Assyrians, a Semitic
population swarming out from the nearby deserts. They subjected the
whole Scythian Old Fatherland to their iron rule during the VIIIth
century B.C. The destruction of the Kingdom of Arpad, on the great
bend of the Euphrates, in 743 B.C. and the capture of the City7State
of Karkemish in 717 B.C. were the final stage of Semitic expansion to



the North. The Sythian tribes, driven out of their old homes, first
concentrated along the Araxes and Kura rivers, in the swampy region
of thousands of islands. Thereafter they gradually occupied the
higher-lying Terek and Kuban regions, and finally took possession of
the large tract of land above the Caucasus, up to the elbow of the
Volga.
When they were at the zenith of their history, in the first millenium
B.C., Scythian kings ruled over the immense natural grassland
stretching from the Carpathians and the Lower Danube eastward,
above the Black sea, to the Caucasian mountains (European Scythia)
and the Caspian sea, including the Touranian Plain and the Oxus
valley (Asiatic Scythia). In addition, detachments of Scythians
occupied other farflung regions, such as northwest India and the
eastern Asian section of the steppe, extending up to the Chinese
borders.
Ruling over such an extensive territory was only possible thanks to the
large scale use of the riding horse, which allowed rapid communication
between widely separated areas. This innovation explains why the
Scythians became the first political organizers in the history of the
entire Eurasian steppe. Prior to the use of riding horses, greater
political units could be established in large river valleys only, where
boats fulfilled the same role, as in the Nile valley and also in the
Euphrates and Indus valleys.
It was between 750 B.C. and 500 B.C. that the individuality of the
Scythians emerged. They had then a mixed economy: some
agriculture, large scale stock-raising, (in which horse-breeding was
predominant) and also mining and metal working. They lived under
kings and princes whose principal identifying emblem was the golden
stag medal. They always moved around on horseback and wore close
fitting pantalons. Their most important arm was a longrange bow,



having arrows fitted with triangular metal heads. Under the impact of
the new equestrial armies, the Scythians evolved a peculiar defense
system, consisting of earthworks. Its purpose was to render any sudden
mounted attack against human settlements impossible. The system
included a fortified rampart or dike with a deep and wide ditch, filled
with water on its outside. The rampart was then planted with thorny
hedges, shrubs and trees. These fences extended for hundreds of miles
and surrounded thousands of acres of soil as well, to keep the
livestock protected against predators. This Scythian military strategy
set the pattern for the entire steppe-population and was to remain
unchanged for centuries to come.
2. Scythians in Hungary
Owing to the growing pressure of the Sarmatians, another mounted
steppe people, the European Scythians slowly drifted westward. They
percolated through the Carpathians, and gradually brought the Great
Hungarian Lowland, the westernmost fringe of the great Eurasian
natural grassland, under their control. They soon transported hereto
their royal seat and thus Hungary became the center of Scythian rule.
The first Scythian group reached Hungary around 550 B.C. They were
called Agathyrsi and have established campsites in the Upper Maros
region. They were followed by other groups, occupying many places
on the Great Plain, the Transylvanian plateau and in the Bükk and
Mátra area. The Scythians were the first Danubian people to establish
effective rule over the entire population of Hungary. Thus, the
Carpatho-Danubian basin was first unified politically by them. During
their rule in Hungary (c. 500 B.C. - 350 B.C.), the Scythians came into
contact with the aboriginal Magyar population on a large scale,
through intermarriage. Following this historical process, all the
Magyar speaking population of the Danube basin began to call
themselves "Scythians", an appellation that strongly influenced the
view of the medieval chroniclers, who considered the Magyars as a



Gens Scythica. The long stay in Hungary of the Scythian ruling clan is
evidenced by the most beautiful Scythian treasure ever found,
consisting of two gold stags, discovered at Tápió-Szent-Márton and at
Zöld-Halom-Puszta respectively (Fig. 30-31).
Fig. 31. Scythian gold-stag from Zöld-Halom-Puszta in an unusual
posture. Hungary, Vth century B.C.
The last major detachment of Scythians entered the land under the
general name of Sarmati (Sarmatians). They are, however, most
frequently mentioned by their clan-names, as Alani, Yazigues and
Roxolani. The Yazigues settled in Hungary in A.D. 20, and occupied
the pasture-land between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, where they
erected strong fortifications. Thanks to their inaccessible territory, they
could preserve their autonomous rule during the Roman occupation of
Pannónia and Dacia. They lost their ethnic identity during the Hun
period, but a large district and a county still retain their name.
The presence of Scythians in Hungary is superbly documented by the
archaeological remains of their civilization: grave-mounds and colossal
defence installations. The grave-mounds or barrows resulted from the
earth they heaped up upon the tombs of their defunct leaders, kings
or princes. Grave-mound in Hungarian is Sir-Halom or simply Halom.



This term forms part of several dozens of old place-names all over the
country, such as Herceg-Halom, 'Prince's Mound'; Zöld-Halom-Puszta
'Green Mound on the Steppe' (there are four such names), in one of
them a precious gold stag-medal was found, proving that the mound
is really a princely one; Sas-Halom 'Eagle's Mound'; Hegyes-Halom
'Pointed Mound' (two such names); Száz-Halom 'Hundred Mounds'
(where the victims of a huge battle have been buried in the Hunnic
times). Until 1939, 85 Scythian burial sites were excavated in
Hungary, a testimony of the numerous Scythians who were living
there.
The innumerable remains of the former Scythian defense system
allowed the archaeologists to reconstruct its whole extension. The
main line, often in triple rows, started at the Danube elbow at Vác and
proceeded eastwards along the northern edge of the Great Plain
through Eger and Tokaj to Nyíregyháza. At that point it turned
southwards, by-passed Szatmár, Nagyvárad, Gyula and Versec, and at
that level, it reached the Danube again. At certain strategically
important points, such as at Sopron on the west, and the region of
Diósgyőr in the northeast, more elaborate embankments were
constructed. Secondary or disconnected ditches existed near rivers at
crossings and fords (Garam, Vág, Maros, Temes, Olt), and in mountain
passes as well. The rectangular rich land between the Danube and the
Tisza to the south was protected by triple lines on its open northern
side. The total length of the embankments and ditches in Hungary
exceeded 1700 km, while the enclosed and protected area measured
62,000 km2. The building of these defence lines required the removal
of 20,000,000 m3 of earth (P 084 and P 102). The technical terms for
the various parts of the defence installations were the following: the
general name of earthen stronghold was Föld-Vár, the ditch was Árok',
the rampart or embankment was Gát; the fence or hedge on top of the
embankment Sövény, the enclosure or area surrounded with



entrenchment was Sánc or Udvar. These technical terms occur by the
dozens in Old Hungarian place-names; one has only to open the
Directory of Hungary's place-names to be convinced about this. We
have such names as Duna-Földvár, Árok Szállás, Gát-Falva, Sövény
Háza, Sánc, Sánci-Puszta, Sánc-Pataka, Udvar-Hely, etc.
When was this system built and who were its builders? It is obvious
that the whole system was not erected at one time. Certain sections
were, in all probability, completed during the last centuries of the first
millenium B.C., toward the end of Scythian domination, when their
rule was threatened. Other parts were built by the Sarmatians, the
successors of the Scythians proper, between 250 and 300 A.D.
Furthermore, the work was continued during the Hun period as well.
Sometimes the ditches' names may give a clue to this question, which
are in English: 'Ditch of the Giants', 'Ditch of the Devil', 'Ditch of the
Dark Men' (i.e. Csörsz Árka, Csörsz meaning 'Dark' in the local
parlance). Other names point to a younger period, such as 'Ditch of
the Huns', 'Road of Attila', 'Ditch of the Avars' and 'Roman
Embankments'.
To erect so many mounds, and build such gigantic earthen
strongholds, it was necessary to have a strong central authority,
unified planning, constant maintenance work and, above all, a great
number of people for manual work. It follows that not a "few"
Scythians had come to live in Hungary, as was earlier erroneously
supposed, but "many": ordinary people, as well as kings and princes.
3. The language of the European Scythians
Ancient authors, such as Herodotus, Strabo, Plinius, Jordanes and
others agree that all Scythian people spoke the same language, and
modern scythologists have also accepted this view almost
unanimously. The controversy begins with the next question, viz. what



was this language and with which language group was it affiliated? In
trying to solve this mystery, we will examine, in turn, common
Scythian words recorded by foreign authors, then Scythian ethnic and
personal names, and finally Scythian symbols and other written
evidence.
One of our principal sources is, of course, Herodotus who had such a
keen interest in the Scythian way of life that he undertook the
tiresome journey to Olbia on the Black Sea shore to find out more
about it. He noted that every Scythian carried an inward curving
sharp knife strapped to his boot, and called "A Cina Kesh". In present
graphic form, this expression would be A csizma kés (The Boot Knife),
whose most important element Kesh, 'Knife' is Kés in Hungarian as
well. Herodotus also relates that one of the Scythian names for
Sungod was Oetos-Ur-Us, which is also a Hungarian name
Ötös Ur-Ös 'Number 5 Divinity', five being the sacred number of the
Sungod, as already mentioned. The Master also noticed that Upper
Scythia is often snow-covered in winter, for which reason the soil is
concealed from view for months. And he adds that the Scythians call
the snow-flakes 'feathers'. Similarly, in Hungarian the same word Pihe
is used for both the fine feathers and the light snow-flakes.
The father of historiography was charmed with all that he had learned
about the principal Scythian river, the Dnieper, then called Danaber,
something like Tanya Bor 'River of the Field' in Hungarian. It was also
called Bor Ysthenes, which is again a Hungarian name, meaning
'Divine Water' or 'Fine Water'. Then Herodotus lists a series of
arguments why the river is so fine. This river "has upon its banks the
loveliest and most excellent pastures for catties; it abounds in the
most delicious fish; its water is most pleasant to the taste; its stream is
limpid." All these added expressions bolster the Hungarian etymology
of the word Ysthenes. And the other part of the river's name, 'Bor',



signifies in the local Sekeli-Hungarian dialect of Transylvania,
'drinking water', most often of thermal origin.
Turning now to the Scythian ethnic and personal names, we again refer
to Herodotus who says that the name by which the Scythians above
the Black Sea called themselves, was Scoloti, whereas the Assyrians
called them Ishkusai or Ashguzai and the Greeks simply Skytoi. When
these names are placed back into their original spelling, according to
the phonetical evolution of the Hungarian, they prove to have been
taken from the Hungarian vocabulary. All the names in question
terminate with the adjectival suffix -i, which gives the name the
meaning of 'originating from', 'coming from' or 'native of'. It follows
that the preceding word must indicate the specific geographic area
where the Scythians formerly lived. In the case of Scoloti (< H.: Ös
Kelet-i) this original homeland is 'Ancient Orient' (the same as Chaldi,
Khaldi), by which name Babylon was also called. The meaning of Ish
Kuza-i and Ash-Guza-i presents no difficulty, when remembering the
easy interchangeabi-lity of the kindred consonants K, G and H. It
means in Hungarian Ös-haza-i 'Originating from the Old Fatherland',
—again Mesopotamia, the same geographic area. At first sight, less
evident is the etymology of Skytoi, which may be the Grecized form of
the original Hungarian Szigeti 'Coming from the Isles', a reference to
their sojourn in the thousand islands of the rivers Kur and Araxes in
the southern Caucasus.
All the names analyzed were first given to the Scythians while they
were still living in the Caucasian region, busy reconstructing their
political set-up with various 'blood-contracts'. They retained these
names even later, when another of their group settled in a similar
region, around the other side of the Caspian Sea (in Touran). Because
of the multitude of isles in that area as well, Ptolemy called it Insulae
nationum, 'Isles of Nations'. From the third century B.C. onward, when
the Scythians had already lived for generations in their acquired



'Scythia', they were no longer considered as newcomers, but as
'natives' in their own country. Accordingly, they began to be called
Hon-i, or in ancient Hungarian spelling: Huni 'Natives', 'Country-Men',
again in plain Hungarian. The first Scythian detachments posted on
Hungarian soil were the Agathyrsi, in the Upper Maros valley,
Transylvania. They were assigned to frontier-guard duties, as their
name clearly implies: A Gath Yrsi < A Gát Őrző 'Guardians of
Embankments'. The last Scythian confederation of tribes to settle in
Hungary were the Yazigues: they settled between the Danube and the
Tisza rivers, in the southern central part of Hungary in A.D. 20. By
trade, they were cattle keepers and shepherds, as is proven by their
name: Yazigue < Jószág (őr) being 'Cattle (keepers).
The list of Scythian ethnic denominations can be completed by a few
royal names with a clear meaning. These are mainly the ones which
include the distinguishing word 'Aryan', Ur, Ar in Hungarian, as Aria
Peita <Arja Fajta 'King who is of Aryan origin'; Ari-Antus <Arja Honős
'Aryan Land Ancestor'; Scyl-Urus < Urös 'Székely Ancestor'. All the
foregoing details are sufficient to convince the reader that the
Scythians were misjudged until now as far as their ethnic and linguistic
identity is concerned. It seems absolutely certain to-day that they were
Magyar tongued and belonged to the once widely diffused Hungarian
race.
The written documents the Scythians left behind them bring fresh and
decisive evidence to the above conclusion. Amongst such documents,
the oldest one is written by the pictorial method which conveys
abstract ideas by images of similar-sound-ing concrete objects, as has
been indicated several times. In Scythian practice, and also elsewhere,
the pictorial writing was mainly used to express royal titles, such as
Ancestor, Divine Ancestor. For the former title, the image of an eagle
was used, whereas for the latter, that of a stag. The names of these
animals in Hungarian, Sas and Szarvas, sounded, indeed, like Az ős



and Az Urős respectively. This method of identifying rulers by that way
was very widespread, especially in the first millenium B.C., so that a
golden stag found in a Scythian mound was considered by
archaeologists as the supreme evidence of being connected with a
royal tomb.
Because of inherent difficulties, pictorial writing was rarely used for
communication of messages of any length; we know of only two such
examples, both recorded by Herodotus. The first message narrates
how the newly acquired Scythian Kingdom was inherited by Colaxis,
the youngest of the three sons of Targitaus, the conqueror (P 067
Book VII cap. 64). God had strewn upon the earth, from the sky, four
golden implements: a plough, a yoke, a battle axe (sagaris) and a
drinking cup. The Kingdom should be inherited by the one of the
three brothers who could pick them up. The two elder brothers failed
to do so because the gold took fire as they approached it. But when
the youngest born neared the treasure, the flames suddenly vanished,
and he picked up the gold. What was the divine message written with
these golden objects? We can find out by writing down, one after
another, the names of the four items in the Hungarian language:
EKE.IGA. SAGARIS.KUPA, which gives the following similar sounding
sentence: E7KEIG/AS/AGARIS/ KEPE: E kölyök az Égurös képe 'This
child is the deputy for the Heavenly Lord'. That meant, in
contemporary language, the Colaxis (the Child) must assume the title
'God on Earth', i.e. the royal dignity. The children had understood the
message and they agreed to bequeath the kingdom to the youngest
born —says Herodotus.
The second known pictorial message of the Scythians, also in the
Hungarian language, was sent to King Darius in 512 B.C., when the
latter invaded Scythia to avenge the destruction of Assyria, a hundred
years earlier. As the Persian armies bogged down, following the
scorched earth policy of the Scythians, Darius, to save face, declared



that he would be satisfied with a symbolic submission by receiving the
usual water and earth gift from the Scythian king. But, instead of the
required gift, the Scythian king sent Darius a bird, a mouse, a frog and
five arrows. The Persian king thereupon consulted his chief advisors to
find out the meaning of the message. There was, indeed, no doubt
that this was a written document. The advisors were divided in their
interpretation: some deciphered it as a peace-offer, the Scythian king
would be willing to make to the Persians. Others thought that the
message contains a serious threat, viz. that all the Persians will be
killed with arrows. Darius agreed with the second reading and, panic
stricken, left Scythia on one of the following nights. To find out the
meaning of the strange message, we again write down the
corresponding Hungarian words: MADÁR. EGÉR.BÉKA. ÖT. NYIL and
we find the similar sounding, sentence: Magyari kér békét őnála,
'Magyar asks for peace with him', exactly as the first group of advisors
had deciphered the message. A second interpretation is possible, when
the word for mouse (egér) is replaced by another one for the same
animal, Sir, used by the kindred Komi (P 060 p. 19). In that case the
message reads thus: Magyar sírba küld nyíllal 'Magyar will kill thee
with arrows'. And that was the way Darius himself interpreted the
intention of the Scythians.
Besides the pictorial writing, the Scythians were also acquainted with
the carved script and bequeathed us a unique message written in that
way. It is engraved upon a silver dish 14 inches wide found near the
town of Sakiz to the south of Lake
Urmia. It is decorated with animal figures in a row between two
concentric circles. Its featured decor was a golden horse, set in the
centre. The treasure was meant for a wedding present offered by a
Scythian prince on the occasion of the marriage of King Bartatua or
King Madyes, to an Assyrian princess in the second half of the VIIth
century B.C. (P 054 p. 106; P 123 p. 22 f.). The script (reproduced in



P 054 p. 109 and explained in P 007 II p. 63 f.) reads thus in
Hungarian: E kis tálcát valaki bőkezűen neki adja; as éke ló 'This small
tray is generously given to him by somebody; its adornment is a
horse'. After that follows the value of the ware, in conformity to
ancient uses and customs. Now, the expression 'its adorment is a
horse' conceals the identity of the donor as Sekeli, 'a Siculi'.
Finally, we must mention that the Scythians probably had studied and
used Greek letters as well, proof of which are two coins of the Indian
Saka-dynasty (first century B.C.). On one of the coins the following
Magyar words appear: TURANNO UNTOS 'ERAOY and on the other
side: SAKA KOGGANOI. On the second coin: YRKODOY MAKAROY,
and on the back: SK'WR (i.e. SAKA UR), (transliteration in P 059 p.
133). According to the present Hungarian orthography, the
inscriptions would read thus: 1. Turáni Honös, Király — Székely kagán
'Touranian land -ancestor, — Siculi kaghan' and 2. Uralkodója Magyar
— Székely úr' 'Its ruler is a Magyar, a Siculi Prince'.
The three kinds of writing illustrated — pictorial, carved and
alphabetical — definitely prove our previous statement: that the
Scythians were a Hungarian-speaking people, literate and skillful in
writing.
4. Who were the Kelti or Celts?
History books tell us, that around 300 B.C. the name 'Scythian'
abruptly vanished from circulation, and that per contra, the Kelti
name made its appearance at about the same time. Is there any
connection between the two phenomena? Nobody knows with any
certainty, in spite of ample available material for the study of Celtic
problems. In Hungary alone, for example, over 590 Celtic sites were
discovered until 1976, — says Miklós Szabó, author of a book on the
Celts in Hungary (P 119 pp. 36 and 16). The basic two volume



publication of Henri Hubert (P 070) gives a great deal of factual
information about the general history of the Celts, but is already
somewhat antiquated. Two smaller recent works, the comprehensive
study of Venceslav Kruta (P 083) and Jan Filip (P 049) respectively
are far from able to fill the gap. None of the authors mentioned took
full advantage of the invaluable help toponymy offers to scrutinize the
Celtic place-, ethnic and personal names, although such names are
copiously recorded even in J. Caesar's De bello Gallico. Furthermore,
Celtic inscriptions engraved upon coins and other archaeological finds
were also not taken into due consideration. We even ignore the
meaning of the very name: Kelti.
As regards the ethnic identity of the Celts, it was thought, two
generations ago, that they were an individual, original human species,
i.e. men of high stature and fair complexion. To-day our scholars are
inclined to see in these 'first Europeans' rather small-statured, lightly
brownish complexioned 'Mediterraneans'. Again others are of the
opinion that the Celti were only a ruling class over the previously
immigrated, predominantly pre-Indo-European population. Still others
think that the Celts were Indo-Europeans who strongly mixed with the
aborigines. We do not lack hypotheses, but the truth is, as V. Kruta
puts it: "For the time being, there exists no indisputable evidence for the
ethnic appurtenance of those who have been called the 'Princes of the
first Iron Age" (P 083 p. 64).
In the present state of our researches, we must make use of
circumstantial evidences to learn more about the ethnic identity of the
Celts. A closer look at the manifestations of Celtic civilization,
convinces us that they contained no new feature; all their most
striking characteristics having already been evident in the previous,
Scythian civilization. These included the fortified place protected by
embankments, ditches and hedges, the multitude of animal images
which pervaded their arts, the use of horses and sunworship, a



heritage from the New Stone Age. There was only one new addition to
Celtic culture: the extensive use of iron. It follows that the 'Celts' must
have been an amalgam of the previous non-Indo-European inhabitants
of Europe. This is exactly what scholars have discovered during the
course of their comparative studies. It was found, indeed, that the Picti
of northern Scotland were already Celts — "early Celts" — who called
themselves by that word in the form of Khaldes or Chaltis, which is
the Kelti in ancient graphic form (P 132 p. 139). J. Hawkes also places
the makers of the bell-shaped vessels into the category of the Celts.
There too, the peoples of the barrow-graves can be found (i.e. the
Scythians, P 049 pp. 16 and 20), and also the Turoni, who migrated
from Central Europe to the banks of the Loire (P 089 p. 11), as well as
the Secani, who went from Hungary to France, etc. There were also
peoples called Kelto-Scythians, Kelto-Ligurians, Kelt-Iberi. Thus, it is
evident, that the Celts were not a new race in Europe, and the Celt or
Kelti name was used as a comprehensive designation of the entire pre
Christian population of Europe.(47)
The huge and kindred Celtic mass of B.C. Europe was linked together
by a common language as well, in addition to the above-mentioned
identical elements of their civilization. According to the estimate of
Camille Julien (Paris) "a hundred million" Europeans spoke the Kelti
language in the second half of the first millenium B.C. Consequently,
there was no linguistic barrier in ancient Europe.(48) In spite of these
categorical statements, nobody has, alas, identified the Celtic
language, nor proved its affiliation with any other. In that respect we
are still completely in the dark. The reason? Nobody has yet
approached the Celtic problem with the Hungarian key. In the
following, we shall try to analyze the etymological meaning of the
fundamental word: Kelti.
Before us, Henri Hubert, the most eminent French specialist of the
Celts has made great efforts to find out the meaning of the Celti name.



He carefully noted all the various graphic forms in which this name
occurred and concluded (1) that it reached its widest diffusion during
the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and (2) that it contains the rootword
Kel (Quel in French graphic form), "implying the idea to rise" (P 070 I
p. 27). He mentions this meaning as the most probable one, amongst
many other conjectures listed in a footnote. He could, however, not go
any farther in his explanations, thus the question remained unsolved.
(49)
In Hungarian the word Kel signifies 'to rise' and Kelet the cardinal
point where the Sun rises, i.e. 'Orient, East'. And the same word, when
the -i suffix is added as Kelt-i, Kelet-i means 'He who has come from
the direction of the rising Sun', i.e. from the Orient. In ancient times,
this word was spelt in various ways, such as Chaldi, Chaldean and
Scoloti. Like most ancient Hungarian ethnic names, it indicates no
ethnic particularity, but is merely a geographic appellation recalling
their previous fatherland. As such, it was a fitting comprehensive
name, because all the pre-Indo-European ethnic groups originated
from the same region: from the ancient Orient. Thus, the name Kelti or
Keleti was the general term designating all the Hungarian speaking
ethnic groups which had migrated to Central and Western Europe from
the ancient Orient since the New Stone Age.
The Kelti were a very cultured human mass, to whom Europe owes a
great deal. They were the one who christened all the great rivers and
mountains of that continent, who designated the places of the future
great cities, and planned the first network of communication. They
were the 'first Europeans'. Had History given them another hundred
years, they would have formed a great unitary nation, centered
around Gallia and Hungary. But this century had not been granted to
them. As is known, the Romans, "who have become the enemy of the
race which founded it", literally destroyed this nation during its
gestation. The holocust of the Celts in Gallia was perpetrated by Julius



Caesar and his legions, in the first century B.C., between 59 and 51.
They systematically massacred all the political leaders of that nation,
their soldiers and priests, killing altogether three millions and setting
fire to eight hundred towns and villages. After that, the people were
economically ruined, terrorized, assimilated and Romanized. The
history of Europe does not know of any other similar killings. Yet, Caesar
had been whitewashed by historians of all his crimes and stands before
us as a "Great European". Only the Kelti in Hungary were capable to
outlive the century of hell in Europe.

THE HUN HUNGARIANS
1. The Roman and Germanic influence upon the ethnographic
conditions in the Carpatho-Danubian basin
1. The peaceful penetration of Magyar-speaking Oriental tribes into
the Carpatho-Danubian region was interrupted after the Scythian and
Celtic periods and was replaced by armed interventions from the
West. First came the Romans, an imperialist people. After having
created a solid basis on the Apennine peninsula, they gradually
extended their domination over the entire Mediterranean area during
the second and first centuries B.C. Thereafter, for growing security
and economic reasons, they extended the frontiers of their Empire up
to the Danube, which meant, for Hungary, the occupation of her
western province, Transdanubia. After a difficult and long war (from
12 B.C. to 9 A.D.) they besieged it and about fifty years later
converted the conquered land into a Roman province, under the name
of Pannónia. They ruled this province for about four hundred years,
and then gradually handed it over to the Huns, between 409 and 433.



What interests us, regarding the Roman rule of Pannónia, is to
ascertain what had happened to the large Magyar-speaking population
there. In that respect, we must first recall that the Roman conquest
was prompted by strategic considerations and its military character
was predominant up to the very end. Above all, the Romans wanted to
build a strong military barrier along the Danube. Secondly, the
province's Roman governors were not as blood-thirsty and ruthless as
was Julius Caesar in Gaul. Thanks to these circumstances, the Roman
conquest was neither followed by wholesale massacres of the
inhabitants, nor by the extermination of the upper classes, nor by the
colonization of the land by a Latin-speaking population. The former
tribal structure of the society was maintained, including local
administration (P 087 pp. 112, 117). The legions which were keeping
watch on the Danube, and the various auxiliary personnel employed
for guarding the military roads were mostly manned by a local
population, including their commanders. Moreover, what was no less
important: the Romans did not suppress the native beliefs. Thus, once
the war was over, life, on the whole, followed its ancestral course.
Taking all that into account, our scholars evaluated the effect of Roman
rule in Pannónia, from an ethnographic point of view, as harmless.
Those who studied Hungarian life in Pannónia under Roman rule
more closely, have pointed out certain linguistic facts which evidence
the survival of the Hungarian language. The very name of the land
Pannónia, for example, is a Hungarian compound with Pan and Hon
(=H.: Fenn-Hon) meaning 'Upper Land'. The most important city was
Savaria, so named after the Sungod (cf. Savi-tra, Savarna, P 044). In
that city, God was worshipped in a great temple, which had an
immense Sundisc above its altar. The present-day village of Szabar,
near ancient Savaria, probably retains the ancient city's names.
For the survival of the Hungarian language under the Roman rule, it is
highly significant that the Roman emperors, coming from Pannónia,



used Hungarian throne-names, as did Had-Ri-Anus (117-138), Aur-Eli
Anus (270-275), Val-Eri-Anus (253-260), and Sev-Erus (193-211). In
these names the Hungarian component -Anus (= Honős) often
appears, meaning 'Country Ancestor', or the word -Erus (Urős) 'Divine
Ancestor'. It is not surprising to find so many Hungarian traces in
Pannónia, since the political and military centre of the Roman Empire
was, in the third and fourth centuries A.D., no longer in Rome, but in
Pannónia and Illyria instead. During this time, these provinces, or
rather their inhabitants, supplied the best soldiers, governors, and
emperors, and also 'Roman' virtue.
After the conquest of Pannónia, the Romans conquered the eastern
part of Hungary as well and emperor Trajan converted it to another
Roman province named Dacia. The emperor personally conducted the
military operations (101-105). The occupation of this land was
actually prompted by economic reasons: the Romans wanted to lay
their hands upon the abundant supply of gold, silver, copper and salt
which was mined there. Dacia's occupation was, however, short lived,
lasting about a century and a half. Indeed, the province had to be
abandoned in 271, when Roman personnel was evacuated and
withdrawn to the southern shore of the Danube. The three most
important Dacian cities, Sar-Mizegeth-Usa, Napo-Ca, and A-Pu-Lum
have clear Hungarian meanings. The first name would be in present
spelling Sár-Mezőket-Ásó (city) 'Where gold fields are dug', the second
Nap-Kő 'Sun City', and the third A Fő Ló (városa) '(City) of the
Principal Horse', also a Sun city.
The Roman never subjected the mountainous northern section of
Hungary, nor the great Central Plain, between Pannónia and Dacia, to
their rule. The tribes living in that part of the land maintained their
independence. So, Roman domination passed without vital harm in
Dacia as well. But, by dismembering the Carpatho-Danubian land into
three parts, they retarded the unification of the diverse social groups into



a single nation, a process which had been going on since Scythian times.
Thus it happened that the territorial re-unification of the entire
Carpathia area and the building of a nation befall the next generation of
great leaders: King Attila and Prince Arpad.
2. Shortly after the Roman Empire's entry into the Carpathian basin,
Germanic tribes also began their penetration into the land. They started
from their northwestern homeland Scandia (Scandinavia) pushing
eastwards on the East-European table-land until they had reached the
River Don in the third century A.D. They were called Goths, and
formed two separate groups, the Ostro-Goths and the Visi-Goths. A
third Germanic tribal federation, the Gepids, was formed inside the
Carpathians, in Transylvania, above the Maros river, as far as the
Tisza.
The appearance of Germanic tribes in Eastern and Central Europe
filled the Romans with fear, so they encouraged the Huns, who were
also threatened, into action. The tense situation provoked the armed
intervention of the Huns in 375. After this, Germanic rule crumbled
away and the Huns gained control over all eastern and central
Europe. This is all well known in history, so that we do not need to
discuss it. But less known is the ethnic build-up of the Germanic tribes
in question. It is, indeed, a false assumption that the Germanic tribes
were as fully Germanic in Eastern and Central Europe as they were
when invading continental Europe from Scandinavia around Christ's
birth. The explanation is obvious: when the Germanic tribes started
for the distant adventure, they usually travelled without women folk
and therefore strongly mixed with local population during their
wanderings. That had the effect, that within three or four generations,
they were a completely different people from the one that set out. The
following short analysis will show how the Germanic tribes mixed
with Hungarians when they reached the domain of the Magyar ethnic
body.



The name Gepida was given to the confederation of Germanic tribes
which occupied northeastern Hungary. It has no accepted etymology
in the Germanic language, but has in Hungarian, where Gyep-i Ta
means '(Men) of the Grass-Land', where the Gepids actually lived. And
in the case of the Visi-Goths, which name is supposed to signify 'West
Goths' in the Germanic language, the Hungarian gives again a more
plausible explanation. In it Visi (in to-day's Hungarian Vizi) means
'Those who live near water courses', which was again true of the
Goths. The Germanic ethnic identification symbols were also taken
over from the local population, particularly the eagle, typical symbol
of the steppe population, and also birds in general. We should also not
forget that Gothic script, the so-called Runen, was a simplified Magyar
carved script. Its German name originated from the Hungarian word
róni 'to carve'. Thus, we should agree with the statement of Gyula
László, according to which "the scant upper class of the Goths, the
conquering layer, underwent an almost complete transformation
under the impact of local traditions and customs" (P 087 pp. 161
164). The modified social structure of the Goths and Gepids was one
of the main reasons why they accepted to stay in the Carpathian land
so readily even after the Hun conquest, faithfully serving their new
king Attila. All that considerably modifies the image we had of the
migration of the Germanic peoples, at least in the sector of
southeastern Europe. It altogether confirms that the aboriginal
Hungarians could keep their own ethnic identity unchanged. And that
was the most important feature of the Middle Danube basin on the eve of
the coming of the Huns.
2. The coming of the Huns
The Huns emerged in history as an Oriental people living on the
pastures of the Oxus river valley, to the south of the Aral Sea.
However, in the second century A.D., most of them had already
skirted the southern end of the Caspian Sea and were in possession of



the land above the Caucasus mountains up to the mouth of the Don
river, the steppeland of former Scythia. Their westward move was
prompted by fatal climatic changes which transformed their cradle
land (Touran) into a semi-desert. Increasing temperatures resulted in
a considerable reduction of the water supply and the grass of the
fields vanished. Thus the Huns, living from animal husbandry, had to
move and look for new grazing land. At the same time, as just
mentioned, Germanic tribes were advancing eastwards on the great
European Plain, by occupying more and more pasture, until they too
had reached the river Don and came in direct contact with the Huns.
Alarmed by their double misfortune, the Huns felt that their very
existence was being threatened and that provoked their violent
reaction. Under their first great king Balamber, they attacked the
Ostro-Goths, their nearest adversaries, and swiftly broke their power.
The Ostrogothic ruling class took refuge in Pannónia and proceeded to
Italy a little later. The bulk of the Gothic population, however,
submitted to the Huns and was incorporated into their politico
military system as a separate entity under its own leaders. The next
Germanic tribal federation, the Visi-Goths, located on the northern
bank of the Lower Danube, seeing the defeat of their brethren, offered
no resistance, but gave up their land, crossed the Danube and entered
into the Roman Empire. Thus, the Huns, with a single sweeping
action, arrived at the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in 375
A.D.
Immediately thereafter, the Huns began planning the occupation of
the last western segment of the great Eurasian steppeland, the
Carpathian Lowland, inside the mountainous arc, by concluding pacts
and alliances with their kindred tribes: the Yazigues in the Danube
Tisza quadrangle, the Skirs (= Sikeli) in the western half of the
country, the Carpodari in Upper Hungary, as well as with the Romans
themselves, whose famous general Aetius became their most



important ally. By virtue of these multiple alliances, the Huns gained
control of the whole basin inside the Carpathians, without employing
military force. Since the land was given over to Hun sovereignty
peacefully, without war, and with the blessings of Rome, the local
population had no particular reason to expeet hardship. It remained
intact and offered its services to the Hun king, a friend of Rome. The
Huns set up their permanent head-quarters in the heart of the land, at
the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros, wherefrom King Oktar (
+ 430), King Ruga ( + 434) and thereafter King Attila (+453)
governed their extensive empire. Thus, with the coming of the Huns,
Roman and Germanic dominions in Central Europe were liquidated and
the aborigines liberated.
Aetius continued to court the Huns, even after their installation in
Hungary, encouraging them in their westward advance, in order to
ease the Germanic pressure on the northern borders of the Roman
Empire. For the Huns, the prospect of a possible extension of their
sway upon the whole of Europe was an alluring offer, but, as it turned
out, a miscalculation. King Attila was unable to win a clear victory in
the great battle at Mauriacum, near Troyes, France, in 451. The
immense efforts this war required in men and material, and the
authoritarian manner Attila handled his subalterns, overstrained the
socio-political structure of his realm. So, when Attila suddenly passed
away in 453, his empire crumbled, in large part because of the
intrigues and rebellion of the Germanic tribes. Attila's sons were
defeated in the struggle for the succession (455) and returned with
their clans and kinsmen to Scythia, the tract of land above the Black
Sea, beyond the Carpathian ranges. They did not, however, forget
their ancient grandeur and Prince Csaba, the youngest son of Attila, as
soon as he was back in the old country, began to spread the idea of an
armed return to Pannónia (= Hungary), to take revenge upon the
Germans, whom they considered as the main artisans of their defeat.



On his death-bed, he bound his people by oath, to return to Hungary,
as soon as they had gathered enough strength, to rebuild a Hun state.
Thus, the Huns did not disappear as it was sometimes surmised in
certain historical books. They stayed in the immediate neighbourhood,
waiting until the clock would strike the hour of their return. This
moment arrived in 568.
At that time, a strong federation had come into being with the fusion
of two great tribes: the A vari and Chunni consisting mostly of white
Huns. The name Avari (< H.: A vár-i) means 'He who comes from an
embanked stronghold', and Chunni (< H.: Hun-i, i.e. Hon-i), Huns. J.
Thury, a Hungarian historian, established that 37 different sources
identify the Avars ethnically as Huns (P 059 pp. 113,128). In the
Carpathian basin, they mainly occupied the Great Central Plain and
Transdanubia and also considerable parts of present-day Austria and
Dalmatia. The Avars kept their empire and their independence until 796,
when they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who
destroyed their State, whereby the pendulum swing, once again,
westward.
3. The ethnic identity of the Huns
The true identity of the Huns has not yet been clearly established: "We
know nearly nothing about their early history" and "the history of
Attila is still to be written" (P 061 p. 127). Our evidence on the
anthropological build-up of this nation is scanty, because the Huns
cremated their dead, thereby leaving no direct anthropological traces
of them. Hence, what we know about them comes mostly from
second-hand records. In contemporary and later accounts, the Huns
are said to be of mixed origins, like all nations with an Oriental
background. A major proof of this, as is usually pointed out, was their
skin colour which was generally brownish, although there were typical
white Huns as well. Their colour difference subsisted even in the



fourth and fifth centuries, which indicates that the fusion of the two
racial elements of this people had not yet been achieved at that time.
This state of their ethnic evolution explains why they were not only
called by their common name Huni, but also by other names which
emphasize their racial origin. They were called Kush when their
darkish colouring was more evident (P 092 pp. 14 f., 19-22), and
Aryans (< H.: Uri, Ari), when the white complexion predominated.
King Attila is described in the chronicles as a short-statured, darkish
complexioned man, of haughty walking.(50)
The various appellations of the Huns all have some significance in the
Hungarian language. Their most frequent Huni (< H.: Hon-i) name,
often written without H as Unni, Uni, means 'He who lives in the same
land', i.e. who is a native of the country, a compatriot. It is a
geographic and political term, irrespective of racial origin, as were
also the previously analysed names of Magyar, Hungar, Siculi and
Kelti. Thus, the main connecting link amongst all these peoples was
their common Hungarian language and their identical Oriental origin.
Therefore, they mixed easily, once they were placed under a same
sovereignty. And there can be no mistake if Attila is referred to as the
King of Hungary (rex Hungáriáé), since the Huni were considered as
Hungarians (Huni sive Hungari).
In addition to their general names (Huns, Kush, Hungarians) the
various factions of this people also came under local denominations.
(51) These secondary names were mainly noticed after the collapse of
the Hun Empire, when several smaller political entities came into
being. These names usually included the distinctive word -Ág- Ur
'Ruler of the branch so and so'. Examples: Kutzi-Ág-Űr, Hun-Ág-Ur, Sár
Ág-Ur. The ethnic identity of the Huns is nevertheless best evidenced
by their own written records, which we discovered and which we are
now going to analyse in more detail.



4. Hun-symbols and written records
It is often assumed that the Huns were an illiterate, barbaric people
who left no written records. This opinion actually stems from the
inability of scholars to identify and decipher their script. In fact, as
shown below, the Huns bequeathed us with a considerable amount of
written records, most of which turned up in Hungary, the one-time
centre of their vast empire. Apart from sources of archaeological
provenance, diplomatic records also mention their ability to write and
to read. We have, in this respect, the rare testimony of Priscos Rhetor,
one of the most credible observers of the Huns, who led an embassy to
the court of King Attila. He mentions in his report that the King
requested the extradition of certain fugitive Huns, whose names he
read out in his presence from small wooden sticks, from the Byzantine
emperor. Another proof of the Huns' writing ability is the fact that the
incised or carved script was always called a "Hun writing", "Hun
letters" and "Alphabet of the Huns" in Hungary. The legend about
illiterate Huns must be abandoned.
Most existing Hun inscriptions have gold as supporting material and
as such display a solemn character. But the daily records which Priscos
Rhetor himself had mentioned were made on wood or on other
perishable material, which deteriorated and are now lost for ever.
Another preliminary question to be answered is whether the existing
Hun inscriptions, especially those engraved upon expensive materials,
could have really belonged to them at all. We have no reason to doubt
this, since our historical sources are positive in stating that the Hun
kings were, in general, fond of gold, like all Oriental rulers. We read
in these records that Attila's dining table was made of solid gold, and
his cooking dishes were also of gold.(52) The same sources mention
the existence of a huge Hun golden treasure, which later on became
the property of the Hungarian kings by law of succession and was
always kept in Hungary, at the royal court. The treasure included the



legendary sword of Attila, the so-called Sword of God, implying
Attila's divine origin. Moreover, Hungarian medieval charters certify
that Ottokár II of Bohemia was asked to restitute all the gold to the
King of Hungary, which his grandmother, Ann of Masovia, unlawfully
carried away from Hungary to Bohemia. Amongst these precious
jewels "was an expensive gold dish, adorned with the finest and most
beautiful precious stones, as well as many other famous jewels, which
were kept in Hungary from the time of Attila, king of Hungary, and his
successors until now."(53) The listed data dispel even the slightest
doubt one may have that Attila had been the owner of gold dishes and
other precious jewels, which were inscribed.
On the following pages we will show a few Hun symbols, to begin
with, which were used for the purpose of identifying the ruler by
means of homo-phony, i.e. the pictorial method of writing which was
common to all Oriental rulers during Antiquity. Attila's best known
such symbol was the Ast-Ur bird, whose image he wore on his shield.
This word sounds like Est-Ura, 'Ruler of the West'. This title may have
originated from the time when he was only ruling the western half of
the Hun Empire, his brother Bleda having been in charge of the
eastern part. Furthermore, Attila was also called God's Whip, which is
another play on sound for the same title, whip being Ostor in
Hungarian, homophonic with Est-Ur. Finally, a widely used Hun badge
was the stylized insect having the outlines of a bee (H.: Méh), which
identified its bearer (Ur, Ar), as Méh-Ar, i.e. Mahar or Magyar.(54)
Another group of Hun-identifying objects consisted of quadrupeds:
mostly dogs, foxes, and wolves. They were used as totems,
designating the clan from which they had originated. On the basis of
such assumed names, certains Huns could have considered themselves
as "Sons of the Dog" or "Sons of the Fox". King Ruga was probably 'Fox'
(H.: Róka), while King Oktar may have been 'Mr. Dog' (H.: A kutya
ur). The speech of the Huns, especially their battle-cry, was said to



resemble "the roaring of lions" (P 099 pp. 64, 147, 178).(55)
The author has deciphered several of the Hun inscriptions which are
engraved upon gold dishes, found at Nagy-Szent-Miklós, to the south
of the river Maros, which was the central district of the Hun Empire.
The cache was discovered in 1791 and yielded 23 pieces (dishes,
juges, goblets, etc.), all made of solid gold, weighing altogether 9,925
gr. The commodities were probably not for everyday use, because they
are conserved in almost perfect condition, without any trace of wear
or tear. It is likely that the purpose of these jewels was rather to
preserve important historical messages for the progeny, like royal
records. In addition to the individual inscriptions, five richly adorned
vessels (numbered 9, 10, 17, 22 and 23) bear an identical short script.
It always reads from right to left and was written in memory of the
goldsmith who made the decorations: pictures and interwoven
figures. The script (Fig. 32) reads in Hungarian thus: áR-U Ké-Pé.T 1
T.eR.éK U.N CSi-Ná.Ta, in present Hungarian orthography: Árú képét
egy derék hun csinálta, in English: 'The adornment of this article was
made by a skilled Hun.'



Fig. 33. Hungarian language message engraved upon a Hunnic
gold tray. Treasure of Nagy-Szent-Miklós, Hungary.
A longer inscription appears on a gold tray (Fig. 33), marvellously
adorned with a Tree of Life (genealogical tree), flanked on both sides
by two stylized attendant animals. In the higher ranking position there
are two dog-like creatures with pointed ears, and on the second one
are two quadripeds with birds' beaks. The picture may point out the
two major Magyar-speaking peoples of Hungary at that time: Huns
and Magyars. The one line inscription below the picture reads from
right to left and is transliterated thus: aD-iSZ.eN iR-T eR.aN-O.Ni
Ro.Ko.N-oK E.L-aT-Ne-Fe-Ke E.L-T-eK J-U Fó-T, in present Hungarian
spelling it would be thus: A díszen irt Irán-honi rokonok állatnevekkel
éltek; jó volt. Its meaning: 'The Iranian relatives represented on the
ornament, used to live under assumed animal names; that was an
advantage.'
The longest inscription shown here is engraved upon a golden dish of
which there are two identical ones (Fig. 34). Its distinctive feature is
an equilateral cross-sign, placed in the middle of the dish, and is
surrounded by a circular inscription. It was executed with great care,
no doubt because it was King Oktar's royal seal, bearing his full title.
We shall not enter into discussing the complicated meaning of the
cross-sign, but only of the script itself, which reads counter-clockwise,
starting at the 12 o'clock position. The transliteration of the signs is
thus: Ne.Te.T.I-K uN Ki.Rá O.K.T.áR O.R-SZ-E-EGe A.Ra-K Jo.K-oN Ve
Te P-A.Ra-To.K-T-O(l) Po.N-T.I-aK I.SZ.T(er) Vi-Té.Ki-E-K O.Ra-Li-aK
Tó.T-oK U-RA. In full Hungarian: Negyedik hun király Oktár országa.
Örök jogon vette barátoktól. Pontiak, Ister vidékiek, Uraliak, Tótok ura.
In English: 'Realm of the fourth Hun king Oktar. He bought it from
friends by hereditary right. He is the ruler of those living above the
Pontus (= the Black Sea), in the Ister (= Danubian) region, in the
Ural area and of the Slavonic peoples.'



Fig. 34. The great seal of King Oktár the Hun with legend in
Hungarian.
The last Hunnic inscription we will be discussing was found outside
Hungary. It is incised on the pendant of a necklace found in Wolfheim,
Rhein-land. The name of the village where it was found, signifies the
'Dwelling Place of Wolves', a typical Hun designation. The relic comes,
in all probability, from a group of Huns who found refuge there after
the collapse of their Empire. The message on it was prepared with
philological precision (Fig. 35) and is transliterated thus: E.N-G-aR
N.E-N-eT.oL EL-O.N-A.N-aK Na.T.A-P.A Ungár nénitől Ilonának,



Nagyapa 'From Aunt Ungar to Helen, Grandfather.'
The contemporary written documents of the Huns constitute the decisive
evidence that these people were literate, having strong cultural relations
with ancient Egypt, and spoke Hungarian. Their records repeatedly say
that they originated from the Ancient Near East (Iran), and had
acquired their Carpathian land peacefully, by virtue of diplomatic
accords.

5. The bad image of the Huns in Western Europe
After all we have said about the Huns, the question that comes to
mind is how could they have had such bad press in western Europe to
this day. This hatred is focussed mainly upon King Attila, the most
brilliant figure of his race, secondly, upon the Hun people themselves.
As is disclosed from the analysis regarding this subject (P 099 and P
072), chronicler Jordanes, a man of Gothic descent, started the
defamation. It was he who invented the tale that Attila was not a
human being, but rather a monster, born from the love of a dog and a
witch and had a doglike appearance (canis aspersus), with pointed ears.
This monster image has come into circulation, in all probability,
through misinterpretation of the Hun custom of using animal symbols
to indicate their tribal or national appurtenance. So, when the Huns
said that they originated from a wolf or a dog, the naive western
priests and chronicle-writers took these expressions literally, and



justified their abhorrent image with the Huns' own words.
The Huns' monster image was confirmed by a second feature, namely
that God had selected the Hun king to fulfill the ungrateful mission to
be God's whip (flagellum Dei), a kind of Anti-Christ, to punish,
especially the Latin peoples, for their wickedness and crimes. This
second gossip originated obviously from the misinterpretation of the
Huns' original symbol, the whip, which in their symbolism, meant
simply that Attila was the ruler of West, as explained above. Thus the
whip in the hand of Attila had as little to do with a punishing mission
as the one in the hands of Egyptian Pharaohs. If Jordanes, this first
western propagandist, could have had the opportunity to travel
throughout the Hun Empire, he probably would have avoided
spreading so much inconsistency amongst his countrymen. Herodotus,
almost a thousand years earlier, did his reportage on the Scythians
more conscientiously. He spared no trouble and travelled to Olbia, on
the Black Sea shore, to gather firsthand information. The description
of Priscos Rhetor is similarly much more accurate because he had met
Attila personally.
Ordinary Huns were also heaped with slander. It was asserted that
they were subhuman beings, the descendants of Scythian witches and
of unspecified devils, and that their way of life consisted only of
looting, perpetrating robberies and killings. And their speech? Oh,
they did not have any, their mouth could only give out short and
inarticulate sounds like fleeing animals.(56) This latest Hun-feature
also originated from the miscomprehension of the metaphor,
according to which the Hun battle-cry was likened to the roaring of
lions, as the ancient Egyptian kings have done when in battle. To sum
up, all the interpretations the Westerners invented reflect their naivety,
lack of experience and a great deal of bad faith.
The Hun armies never sacked Rome, the holy city of Christendom,



although they could have done so in 452, having arrived at the gates
of the City. In the western interpretation this was not due to Attila's
orders, but to a miracle: the apostles Peter and Paul appeared with
shining sabres above Attila's head, and this sight frightened the
would-be robber who fled. Thereafter, the lucky city was, however,
repeatedly robbed and burned by Germanic tribes. First by the Visi
Goths of Alaric in 410 A.D., and then by the Vandals of Gaiseric in
455, when the two saintly apostles failed to pull out their sabres to
chase away the real robbers. But such arguments would carry no
weight with the makers of myths who persisted in their belief that
with the Huns, the scum of Earth had inundated Europe.
The traditional Hun-phobia of medieval western writers clouded the
clairvoyance of the modern historians as well who were unable to
reason otherwise and saw in Attila the prototype of the Barbar: the
uncut, savage man who built nothing and destroyed everything for the
sake of destruction. They forget that the mass-murderer Julius
Caesar was the true scourge of God in Antiquity, and that the words
Vandal and Vandalism, were not a Hunnic, but of western origin.
Fortunately, Hungarian historians have never accepted the Hun-image
elaborated by their western colleagues. For them, King Attila was the
first great Magyar ruler in Europe, who liberated their forefathers
from the western yoke, stopped both Roman and Germanic
penetration, and rolled back the invaders of the Carpatho-Danubian
basin thus preserving the precious ethnic and political equilibrium in
central Europe. Hungarian historians, also, did not ignore the military
genius of Attila, and stated emphatically, that the Huns had not only a
highly developed culture, but that they had doubtlessly surpassed
western civilization which was at that time, in its darkest "dark age"
(decadence of the Roman and Byzantine empires). Even Charlemagne,
the great Frankish ruler, could not sign his name.



We have to admit, however, that the western historians of today are
making efforts to form a more truthful view of the Huns, bringing it
more into harmony with our modern scholarly standards. After this
cleansing operation, all the incredible features of the Hun-portrait
have been discarded, notably those concerning the Huns' monstruous
origin, their animal language and their so-called earthly mission. But
it will be some time until past conventional wisdom is replaced by the
results of modern research. As an illustration of this process, we read,
in a recent publication, the admission that "the threat which they (the
Huns) had posed to western civilization has probably been
exaggerated" (P 104 p. 69). German authors recognize that the Huns,
as body-guards, were more reliable than their own fellow countrymen.
(57) It shall also be noted that, after all, the central figure of the
German sagas was precisely Attila (cf. Nibelungenlied). Germans even
want to claim that Attila was one of their kinsmen, his name being a
Germanic word, meaning something like "Daddy".(58) It is really high
time that the distorted image of the Huns, this dark blot on western
historiography, make way for some more serious consideration, wherein
the great-power status of the Huns and their world-empire are
acknowledged and appreciated at their proper value.

THE MAGYAR HUNGARIANS
1. Massive influx of Magyars into the Carpathian Land and the
birth of Hungary-I
After the collapse of the Hun rule in Hungary (453), the major
Germanic tribes of the country — Goths, Gepids and Longobards (the
latter since 526 only), — set up individual principalities and quarreled
violently amongst themselves. The Longobards were striving for



predominance but, not having the necessary strength to achieve it,
asked a Hun faction of Eastern Europe to help them defeat their rivals.
With the support of this Magyar tongued faction called Avari (Avars),
the Longobards drove out the Gepids, but felt so insecure in their
domain that they deemed it advisable to evacuate Hungary. They
actually fled to Italy in 568, together with their families. After that, the
Avar Hungarians set up their own kingdom (568-803) in the entire
Carpathian area. At the beginning, the Avar Kingdom extended from
the Don in the East to the Enns in the West. Later it shrank and
covered only the Carpathian basin, the Vienna Plain and the
Bohemian Plateau.
There was much speculation about the ethnic identity of the Avars.
But it seems certain that they already spoke Hungarian when they first
appeared on the scene of history. Their name Avari (< H.: A vár-i)
means, indeed 'Those who live in enclosures (Rings)'. And the throne
name of their first great ruler, under whose leadership they entered
the Carpathian land, was Baján (< H.: Be-Jön), a homophon of 'He
who comes in'. More information is available about the ethnic identity
of the second Avar ethnic wave (670), composed of "White
Hungarians", as is definitely stated in the Russian chronicle of Nestor.
The vastness of Magyar human material that settled thus in Hungary
at that time is reflected by the great number of their graves which
have been excavated, 40,000. The newcomers occupied the edges of
the Great Central Plain, and Transdanubia, and also southern
Hungary, i.e. the best arable lands of the country. The seat of their
government was in Györ (< H.: Gyürü = 'Ring'), a strategically
located and well fortified stronghold at the confluence of the Raba
river and the Danube. The Hungarian chroniclers never use the term
Avar when speaking about them. They call them simply Hungarians,
as do the majority of West-European chronicles as well. They add, at
best, a few adjectives for the sake of a clarification, like "Avars who



are called Hungarians" {Avari qui dicuntur Ungari); "Avars who are
called Huns and Hungarians as well" (Avari qui et Huni sive Hungari).
By the same token, un Avar king is mentioned with the title of "King of
Hungary". The latter has been a famous ruler because his daughter
Berthe became the wife of Pepin and subsequently the mother of
Charlemagne. The quoted data clearly suggest that from 670 onwards,
the Magyars already formed a united nation in the Car-patho
Danubian basin and had an organized State headed by kings. That
was a historical event, and this explains why Prince Arpad could set
up a smoothly working State-apparatus so easily after his entry into
the land. For him, the help of the Hungarians in the Rings was
inevaluable.
The Avar-Hungarian kingdom lasted for about two and a half
centuries. Afterwards, the reorganized Frank Empire resumed past
Germanic expansion toward the East under the half-Hungarian
Charlemagne (771-814) who organized a series of razzias against
Hungary between 796 and 803 and destroyed its central government.
Charlemagne was not much interested in territorial gains. He
preferred to loot the Rings, where the nation's treasures — gold, silver
and precious stones — were guarded. On a single occasion, for
example, he 'collected' so much treasures that 14 wagons were needed
to cart them away from Hungary. Chronicler Eginard (Einhard)
commented on that big haul by saying: "According to human memory,
there was no earlier war in which the Franks have become as wealthy
as just now; for until now, they were poor" (cf. P 098 pp. 113, 240).
As regards the Magyar population of Avar-Hun-gary, it survived the
loss of their State and continued to live almost undisturbed. The
largest administrative unit which continued to function was that
located around Lake Fertő, a rather swampy region in western
Hungary. It was last mentioned in 873. A second surviving mini-state



was the realm of Tudun, in Upper Hungary. This one endured until the
coming of Arpad in 895. The harmful consequence of Frankish
incursions into Hungary was the creation of a politico-military vacuum
in a so vitally strategic part of Central Europe, which caused a lot of
inconveniences both to the local population and to the Germans as
well. Therefore, emissaries were sent to the East-European Arpad
Hungarians even by the German king Arnulf who urged them to come
in to help stabilize the situation. The craving for a new unifier was
fulfilled in 895, with the entry on the scene of Prince Arpad. His coming
opened a new chapter in Central Europe's history.
2. Hungary's ethnographic and political conditions in the IXth
century
1. In the previous chapters we have explained how Magyar-speaking
ethnic groups continuously poured into the Carpathian land, ever
since Neolithic times. They came in successive waves, in increasing
numbers and under various denominations: Magyars, Székely, Kush,
Scythians, Celts, Huns, Avars, etc. Their common starting point was
the Ancient Near-East and they were linked by ethnic, cultural and
linguistic ties. This morphological coherence of the early Hungarians
is probably the most important discovery in our recent historical
science.(59) Now, it will be interesting to find out whether the earliest
population and its descendants were still evident in the IXth century,
at the eve of Arpad's coming.
A first indication of the presence of Magyars is that the mountain-,
river- and village-names they had imparted to the geographic features
of the land were still all in use. Furthermore, their identification
symbols: the bird, the bee, the lion and the ram were also deeply
embedded in the folklore, which was strongly impregnated with
suncult and with general Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Syrian
connections. All that would be impossible to explain without the



continuous presence of the same population and, what is more,
several other reliable sources especially mention the presence of
Hungarians in the land at the said time. During the reign of
Charlemagne's successors, for example, a bishop Hungarus by name, is
mentioned in a charter of 888, and Louis the German, for his part,
refers to a mountain called Marca Vengeriorum, in his charter of 860
and even Charlemagne had several times referred to a Hungarian
stronghold in Transdanubia, Sárvár by name (P 059 pp. 241-242).
And, above all, there is a recently discovered Hungarian chronicle
which survived through a Turkish translation (XVIth century), which
states that the Hungarians of Arpad were greatly pleased to learn,
upon their arrival in that country, that its inhabitants spoke the same
language as they did. Thus it is evident that Hungary was already
populated with Hungarian-speaking people before the coming of
Arpad.
2. Anonymus, our best informer on the IXth century events, records in
his Gesta Hungarorum (c. 1200), that the Arpadians, upon entering
the Carpathian basin, had found a large population there whom he
calls Sclaui, Rameni and Blachi. Scholars have been baffled by these
names he alone mentions, all the more since the proffered
explanations led to chronological and linguistic absurdities. Who were
these peoples? The etymological approach gives us the first important
key to this mystery. The Sclaui name, to begin with, is a Hungarian
compound word which includes the following elements: S-K-Lau-i. At
its ending we notice the adjectival suffix -i, usually meaning 'Follower
of, 'Coming from'. The word Lau, which precedes the suffix, is the
dialectal form of the literary Ló, whose first meaning is 'Horse'. In
ancient times, however, the Sungod was meant by it, who was
imagined as riding upon a horse in the sky.(60) The remaining part of
the word, S-K, when vocalised appears as As Ék, or in softened form:
Az Ég, and means 'The Sky'. Thus the whole compound S-K-Lau-i = Az



Égi Ló-i means literally 'Follower of the Heavenly God', i.e. sunwor
shippers. Consequently, the form Sclaui is not an ethnic denomination,
but a religious one, meaning simply sunworshippers.
The Sclaui dwelt all over the land, but their main settlement areas
were in Transdanubia and in Upper Hungary. Now, these regions were
exactly the same ones where the Székely-Hungarians (,Sikeli, Sikeloi,
Siculi) lived until their partial transfer into Transylvania. Incidentally,
their name includes the very same three consonants, S-K-L, which are
to be found in the name of
S-K-Lau-i. Furthermore, in the present-day Székely local language the
word Ló (horse) is often pronounced as Lau, and means, when used as
a title, not horse, but Lord, as in the nobiliary title Ló-Fö 'Highborn
Man, Marquis'. Finally, the Si-keli were also ardent worshippers of the
Sun and their popular art is full of the symbols of the ancestral
suncult. Their name, in the form used two thousand years earlier, was
also analyzed as signifying 'Follower of the Heavenly Lord'. Upon the
basis of so many similarities, we must concede that Anonymus had, no
doubt, meant that group of Hungarian-speaking people under the word
Sclaui, which was mentioned in earlier sources as Sikeloi, i.e. the
present-day Székely, a group probably originating from the
Mesopotamian cultural sphere.
According to Anonymus' narration, the Rameni were natives of
Transdanubia. Their name contained the following components: Ra
Mén-i, a fine Old Hungarian word, meaning 'Follower of the Divine
Stallion', i.e. again sunworshippers, but this time of Egyptian
persuasion. This term probably meant a Hun faction (Huni or Honi =
'Native'), whose name he renders in Latin as habitatores terrae. — The
third group of Hungarians mentioned by Anonymus in their religious
context were the Blachi who used the carved script to write, remarks
the chronicler. This fact alone strongly suggests that they originated



from the Syrian cultural sphere. Their name confirms it, since its
etymological meaning is the Hungarian Bal-Lak-i 'Originating from
Baal's Dwelling', Baal being the Syrian Divinity of Fire', a local variant
of sunworshippers. They are also called Balasi or Blasi, a synonym
meaning 'He who comes from Baal's House'. There are many
Hungarian place-names compounded with the divine name Baal, such
as Bala, Balaton, Bala-vár, Bálványos, Bélkö, etc. The same name
occurs outside Hungary, in such well known geographic names as the
Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic Sea and region, Belgium, etc. Julius
Caesar mentions in his De bello Gallico that Volok (Volcae) people
were living, together with Rutheni, on the northern foothills of the
Pyrenees (P 030 II p. 36 and Index and map). That all these groups of
peoples were mentioned in their religious connections is revealed by a
remark by Anonymus, a Christian priest, who said that the Sclaui and
Blachi were the most wicked people of the whole world, simply
because they served pagan divinities (viliores homines esse totius
mundi quia essent Blasii et Sclaui, P 120 I p. 66).
The continuous use of Near-Eastern religious names is an obvious
proof that the descendants of the Neolithic and Bronze Age
inhabitants of Hungary still formed the bulk of the population in the
IXth century A.D. Nonetheless, it is impossible to make an
approximate calculation about their numerical strength on the eve of
Arpad's coming. We can only guess their relative importance, on the
basis of a specific archaeological fact: from the late Avar period,
Hungary has 40,000 authentic excavated graves, whereas from the
period of the reunification of the land under Arpad, we only possess
10,000. That would mean that the proportion of long settled
Hungarians to the Arpa-dian newcomers, was 4 to 1. The survival of
Hungarians of diverse religious affiliations in the Danube basin since the
Neolithic and Bronze Ages makes them the most ancient inhabitants of
Europe, who were capable of preserving their original ethnic, linguistic



and cultural identity throughout millenia.
3. To complete our survey of the situation in the Danube basis toward
the end of the IXth century, before the arrival of the last major
Hungarian ethnic wave, we must take a look at the political build-up of
the land. It was a chaotic one, because after the destruction of the
Avar-Hungarian State in 803, the country's organization, in the
absence of a central government, relapsed to tribalism and
regionalism. In north-western or Upper Hungary, there existed a small
post-Avar principality centred around the fortress of Nyitra and well
protected by high mountains. Its existence was continuously
mentioned in historical annals until 875, date of its conversion to
Christianity. Upper Hungary's most famous ruler was Prince Tudun,
whose name is last mentioned in a charter of Pope Eugene II in 826,
wherein he was admonished for building Christian churches (P 109 II
p. 35). Tudun is an
Oriental throne-name (< H.: Tudó-(H)Ona: Tóth-Hon) meaning 'Land
of God Thot' (the Egyptian divinity). At the time of the re-unification
of the country under Arpad, the ruler of that region was Prince Zobor
(<H.: Az Avar) meaning 'The Avar ruler'.
South of Upper Hungary, up to the River Raba, and including the Fertő
Lake, lay a second post-Avar principality. Its administrative centre was
Győr ( =H.: Gyürü 'Ring'). Other minor principalities were around
Lake Balaton. All these western Hungarian post-Avar principalities
were given more freedom of action after the division of the Frank
Empire into three nationally based political entities in 843. They
utilized their liberty by seeking help from their fellow Hungarians,
beyond the Carpathian arc, in Eastern Europe.
The Great Central Plain of Hungary was under the nominal sovereignty
of the Bulgarian Empire and was governed by native princes. At its



southern end, in the Danube-Tisza quadrangle, lived the Alan people
called Yazigues; they were obedient to Prince Salan (<H. Az Alán)
'The Alan'. The separate identity of the Yazigues had already been
erased in the Hun period, but their administrative autonomy subsisted
until 1848. The northern portion of the Central Plain was under the
authority of another local prince, Laborci by name, who ruled from his
fortress-city of Hungvár, 'Hun Fortress', according to Anonymus.
To the east of the Tisza, extending up to the Carpathians three small
principalities flourished. The strongest of them ruled in the region of
Szamos and Körös, with a military base in the mountain fortress of
Bihar. The last ruler of this principality was Mén-Marut, whose throne
name meant 'Sungod's Stallion' (Mén = Stallion; Maruth = the Hindu
name of the Sungod). This monarch lived in Oriental fashion, he even
sported a harem at his court, and ruled over a mixed population called
Chozari (<H.: Kos-Ar-i). The second eastern Hungarian ruler, Dux
Gelu or Gyula, governed the Upper Maros area in Ul-transylvania,
'Beyond the forested Land', his throne-seat being at Gyalu. He was
probably a priest-king, whose symbol, a torch, was carried before him
when he travelled officially (P 120 I p. 95). Another high official of
this petty kingdom identified himself by wearing a sun-disk. The last
Gyula maintained his quasi-sovereign status until the reign of King St.
Stephen (1000-1038), who had him captured and imprisoned for life,
"because he was an inveterate pagan, refusing to become a Christian
and was, in many ways, an annoyance to St. Stephen", writes
Anonymus. — The third and last east -Hungarian petty kingdom
included the area bounded by the rivers Maros, Tisza and the Lower
Danube, with a royal residence at Orsova (= Ur Szava) 'Voice of the
Ruler', like the post-Hittite state in the Ancient Orient, Ar-zawa. The
Prince's name in Latin script was Glad or Clad; it is the softened form
of the original Hungarian word Keleti, i.e. 'Oriental'.
As has been proven in the foregone analysis, all the princes and their



petty kingdoms mentioned in the historical sources of the IXth century
definitely bore Hungarian names and ruled over a Hungarian
speaking population. Prof. János Me-lich, a very conscientious linguist,
came to the same conclusion in his last important scientific paper (P
097). He re-examined the pre-Arpadian prince-list and found that
Menmarut and Glad were certainly native Magyars and that all the
other local rulers spoke "faultless Magyar". He also stated that the
great majority of Hungary's population spoke Hungarian on the eve of
Arpad's coming and was racially inter-related.
3. The formation of the Arpadian people in Eastern Europe
Recent historical studies emphasize that the human mass led by Arpad
into the Carpatho-Dan-ubian basin, significantly differed from those
Hungarians already living in that country. The Arpa-dians evolved,
indeed, their ethnic constitution during the sixth to the ninth centuries
only, by merging with westward-moving Hungarian and Turkish
peoples, on the Eastern European Plain. This all began with the
sudden entry of the Turks into the Caspian-Oxus-Aral area in 568 A.D.
That first blow was followed by a second and more violent one in 597
598. As a result, all the tribes living in the southwestern corner of the
great Eurasian steppe began to roll westwards.
The Turks were mostly stock-breeding, mounted nomads of inner
Asiatic origin, having various independent branches, like the Bisseni,
Chasari and Cumani, to mention only those with whom the Magyars
were to come into closer contact. They had their own language, which
has borrowed heavily from the Hungarian vocabulary, and which,
most likely, also included their historical names. In fact, their names
seem to have been given by Hungarians, since they all have a definite
meaning in that language. The word Turki (anc. form: Tourki), seems
to have resulted from the merging of four elements into a single word:
Tó-Ur-Kö-i, meaning literally 'Those who dwell (-i), in the Land (Kö),



of the Ruler (Ur) of the Lake (Tó)', in short 'Lake Dwellers.' The
implied lake was no doubt, the Aral Sea, because it is surrounded by a
lowland called Touran (< H.: Tó-Ur-Hon), 'Home of the Lake Lord'.
The name Bisseni, Pissoni or Pice-Nati (< H.: Pis-Hon-i; today: Viz
Honi) means 'He who lives by the Water'; and Pice-Nati, in inverted
word order (< H.: Nagy-Viz-i) 'He who lives by the Large Water',
probably referring to the Caspian Sea, for originally they had actually
lived on its shores. As regards the Chasars (Khazari, Chosari) their
name is a compound with Kos +Ar + i, i.e. descendants from the
merging of (white) Aryans and (darkish) Kush peoples, as rightly
observed by the Arab writer, Abu-i-Feda, who said: "The Khazars... are
of two types: some are dark-skinned, often almost black; these are
considered as being of Hindu descent. The second race is white
skinned and exceedingly beautiful" (quoted in P 081 p. 56). In the
beginning, the Khazars dwelt on the northern shore of the Caspian
Sea, whose original 'Hyrcania' (= Aryan) name was changed into
Caspis (< H.: Kush-Viz) 'Water of the Kush'. Ail this points to the
important fact that the Turki peoples were a combination of the
subjugated Aryan and Kush population, with a significant admixture of
Mongol elements.
The first Turkish ethnic branch with which the Arpadians came into
close political union were the Khazars, as was recently demonstrated
by Arthur Koestler (P 079) and Vilmos Kovács (P 081). The Khazars
spoke the Tchuvash dialect of Turkish and had laid the foundation of
their empire in the second half of the Vlth century, more exactly in
567. They became the mightiest power in Eastern Europe in the VHth,
Vlllth and IXth centuries. They had extended their domain over the
entire area to the north of the Caucasian ranges, and subjected the
westermost seven Magyar tribes, living between the Kuban and Don
rivers, to their rule, as well as those who dwelt between the Kuma and
Terek rivers, on the western coast of the Caspian. All these Magyar



tribes living in Caucasia, originated from northern Mesopotamia, the
Kingdom of Urartu, and from the post-Hittite states of Syria, especially
from the Kingdoms of Arpad, Karkemish and Damasek (Damask).
They had to leave their old fatherlands, following the bloody
expansion of the Semitic Assyrian Empire, in the second and first
milleniums B.C. In our historical sources, the memory of the
Hungarians at the Don has been preserved under the name of Dentu
Magaria and of those of the Kuma valley as Kum-Magaria.
The Hungarians of Dentu-Magaria have been incorporated into the
Khazar Empire in 568 A.D. and their symbiosis lasted for over three
hundred years. They were entrusted with the all-important task of
safeguarding the western flank of the Khazar Empire and to block the
descent of the Slavonic peoples toward the south. To fulfill their duties
more efficaciously, the seven Magyar tribes in question were
transferred later to a more suitable location, between the Don and
Dnieper, above the Black Sea. The same strategic considerations led
the Khazars to place the Magyar tribes under a single command, for
which Arpad was selected. His installation as 'Deputy king' was carried
out according to Khazar customs, by elevating him on shields. And the
leaders of the seven tribes, for their part, swore allegiance to Arpad,
solemnly declaring that they would faithfully carry out his orders. All
that may have happened around 850, which may be considered the
birth-date of the East-European Hungarian nation, the Danubian one
having already been in existence for a long time.
The Khazar-Hungarian alliance worked well for about two hundred
years, but when the Khazar king adopted the Judaic faith around 740
and forced it upon his court and military men, the first internal
tensions were quick to appear. A civil war erupted in which the rebels
were defeated. As a result, three deeply involved Khazar tribes, called
Kabars, went over to Hungarian side and were absorbed into their



socio-political system. Then came the renewed attack of the fearful
Bisseni-Turks, who had torn away the pasture-land from the Magyars
and forced them to move more westwards (889), into the Dnieper
Seret-Lower-Dan-ube area, thereby severing their secular alliance with
the Khazars completely. At that time, they had already acquired
enough political maturity to make their own decisions as to the best
way to ensure their survival in social surroundings that were growing
more and more precarious.
Their own worry, which was also shared by the Danubian Hungarians,
gave rise in c. 890 to the idea of merging the two Hungarian nations
into one, inside the spacious Carpathian arena which could be
defended more easily than any tribal community on the unbroken,
vast plain beyond the Carpathians. In the meantime, they had to fight
a mysterious battle against the Cuman-Turks near Kiev, of which we
have no details. It is definitely known, however, that the Cumans'
seven tribes were defeated and that they swore an oath of allegiance
to Arpad and then they too were absorbed into the constantly swelling
Magyar conglomerate, which already consisted of seventeen tribes.
Finally, the descendants of Prince Csaba, the youngest son of King
Attila, also joined the Arpadians, together with their innumerable
clans and cognates of the same region. After all these happenings, the
people Arpad led into Hungary were considerably different from the
Danubian Hungarians. Racially, they were of Aryan, Kush and
Mongolian factions. By religion, they were sunworshippers,
fireadorers, Ismaelits and Moslems. Ethnically, they had strong Turkish
traits, bearing such names as Magyar, Khazar, Kabar, Kuman, Hun,
Bisseni, etc. —a real mosaic with a Turkish veneer. In the Byzantine
court they were classified simply as Turki, and not Hungarians. How
did it happen then, that they could, nevertheless, build a Hungary
with all its components and not a 'Turkey'?
4. The re-unification of the country and the birth of Hungary-II as



a modern state
1. After the destruction of the Avar-Hungarian Kingdom by the Franks
in 783-803, the whole Carpathian land relapsed into a state of
political anarchy and became a battlefield for half a dozen dukedoms
and neighbouring great powers. No wonder that the Hungarians
already in the land, had sent emissaries to their brethren on the other
side of the Carpathians, urging them to move in to rebuild, together
with their united forces, the realm of their great ancestor, King Attila.
The Arpadians received similar suggestions from the interested great
powers, namely from King Arnulf (887-899) of Germany, and the
Byzantine emperor Leo the Wise (886-912) to help achieve their own
political objectives. By this means, the Arpadians had several
opportunities of exploring their future land, especially in 862, 881 and
892. All our evidence points to the fact that the vital decision was
already taken in 892.
The preparations for the conquest were in full swing at that time. In
Kiev, where Almus, the father of Arpad was the deputy-king, all the
available blacksmiths were summoned to make hundreds of thousands
of horseshoes, arrows, cartwheels, swords and the like, which were all
kept in storage. Three hundred lumber jacks were also engaged to
clear a passage through the thick forest. A pincer movement was
planned, according to which the bulk of the invaders would penetrate
into Hungary under the leadership of Arpad through the Verecke-pass,
which had never been used before (841 m above s.-l.), and the second
army, under the command of Arpad's father Almus or his elder son
Levente, was supposed to check the Bulgarian forces and penetrate
into Transylvania through its passes and gorges. The invasion started
in the spring of 895 and, except for the unexpected attack of the
Bisseni and Bulgarians, the Hungarian armies met inside the
Carpathian arc during the summer of the same year, as planned. By
900, the entire territory was in their hands, including Transdanubia.



The incoming Arpadians were greeted as liberators and most of the
native populations surrendered spontaneously to the new master of
the land and even helped with the unification. Those few princes and
dukes who failed to change their allegiance in time, paid dearly for
their mistake. Laborci, Gelu and Zubur who resisted, were killed in
action. Two others, Salan and Glad, fled with their followers. The case
of the sixth prince, Men-marut, was a particular one, insofar as he had
wanted to resist at first, but, at the sight of Arpad's armed men, had
asked for a compromise, offering his daughter in marriage to Arpad's
youngest son Zsolt, while he himself swore obedience to Arpad. In
exchange, he was permitted to keep his stronghold of Bihar as a fief
for life. History knows of very few conquests as clean as Arpad's, which
was accomplished practically without bloodshed.
As soon as the territorial unification of the land was achieved, Arpad
summoned the leaders to his fortress of Csongrád and hammered out
the principles ('Constitution'), according to which the reunified
country was to be governed. The next step consisted of setting up
nation-wide institutions, to bind all the inhabitants of Hungary
together into indissoluble unity. These institutions were almost
exclusively, the creation of the native, and not of the half-way
Turkized Hungarians. In other words, the newcomers were culturally
absorbed into the Magyar-speaking local population which formed the
overwhelming majority in the land. This process is well illustrated by
the following remarks. The unified country became a "kingdom" (and
not a khanat according to the Turkish pattern), with a "king" as its
ruler (and not a khan or kende). The highest officials were the Maior
Domus Nádor and the Chief Justice, Ország-biró (and not Horka and
Kádár). The king was represented as someone seated upon a throne
(and not in a saddle on horseback). The symbolic animal identifying
the king was a lion (and not a hyena, ram or dog). One of the most
important institutions, which welded and kept the various elements of



the society together, resulted from the adoption of Christianity. The
new faith imposed, indeed, a common and uniform ideology, and
replaced the pagan Sun-, Fire-, and Baal-cults, which had earlier kept
the nation divided into several parts. Thus, the merging of all
Hungarians of diverse origins, creeds and political traditions into a single
nation was achieved within a relatively short lapse of time.

2. Prince Arpad (+ 907) was not only a military genius but a
successful organizer as well. He clearly perceived the geographic unity
and the strategic position of the Carpathian arena, welded between
two powerful empires. Accordingly, he did not divide the country
amongst the seven princes who were his deputies. On the contrary, he
considered the mountainous periphery of the united land as its



natural defense line and the whole country as an important element of
the European equilibrium, as set forth by the treaty of Verdun in 843.
He was, therefore, anxious to put an end to the encroachments of the
little Moravian State and incorporated its borderland into Hungary in
902.
More fighting was needed before Arpad's strategic-political conception
was recognized and accepted by the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary's
dynamic western neighbour. This empire was naturally inclined to
expand eastward along the Danube valley. The most opportune time
for the realization of its ambitions seemed to arrive with the death of
Arpad, when huge armies were dispatched on both sides of the
Danube toward Hungary. They were, however, defeated right at the
border, in the marshy region of Pozsony (Pres-burg). As a result of this
decisive Hungarian victory, the Danubian provinces of present-day
Austria were annexed by Hungary as far as the river Enns. The whole
area remained under Hungarian rule until 933, when one of their
armies was defeated near Merseburg, and again in 955, near
Augsburg. After these events, Hungary's western borders were
gradually withdrawn to the line of the Lajta and Fischa rivers, where
they were stabilized for a thousand years and mutually recognized.
After that, there was no obstacle for the participation of Hungary
under Prince Géza at the meeting of Quedlinburg (973), called in by
the German emperor Otto the Great, to discuss the common security
problems of Central Europe.(61) The memory of Hungarian rule in
Moravia has been kept alive until our days by numerous village
names, built upon the Hungarian vocable, such as Uhersky and Uhr
Sitz (7 such names), or with other Hungarian words, such as Sallash
(= Szállás), the Hungarian for 'summer dwelling'. Similarly, many
Hungarian village-names survived in the Ostmark, out of which 25
include the word 'Hungarian', such as Ungar-Bach, Ungar-Stein, Ungar
Berg, Marca Hungarica; 103 others are compounded wirh Warte-,



Schiitze and 196 are built upon Ode, meaning uninhabited land, all of
them being situated within the former defense line, as explained by
Sándor Török (P 129 p. 22f).
The relations between Hungary and the Holy See of Rome were always
cordial, as soon as the Hungarians had put their heads under the
baptismal water, thereby irrevocably becoming loyal members of the
new European community. Pope Sylvestre II together with the German
emperor Otto III, recognized Hungary as a sovereign State. As a token,
he sent a golden royal crown to the ruler, who was solemnly
proclamed 'King of Hungary" on Christmas Day of the year 1001. The
Pope's gesture was repeated later by the emperor of Byzantium, who
also recognized the sovereign status of Hungary. The two crowns were
welded together into one and symbolized the great powers' alliance
with Hungary.
The Holy See of Rome also entrusted the kings of Hungary with the
mission to defend, spread and propagate Christianity in the
neighbouring pagan countries, especially in the Balkan Peninsula,
which was full of schismatics at that time. This resulted in Hungary's
expansion toward the Adriatic Sea by including Croatia (1097),
Dalmatia (1105) and Bosnia (1210). Thus, at the end of the XIth
century and the beginning of the XIIth, not only was Hungary's sovereign
status universally recognized, but the country had become a powerful
kingdom, ranking third in importance, right after the Holy Roman and
the Byzantine Empires. So, after a successful start, Christian Hungary
was heading toward the finest hour of its history.
Thus, the period of Ancient History of the Hungarians came to a close.
5. Epilogue: The fate of the lost Hungarian tribes
After the bulk of Hungarian-speaking peoples -Scythians, Huns, Avars
and Magyars- moved out of Eastern Europe and settled in Hungary,



this race ceased to play a significant political role in the oriental part
of the continent. Ethnographi-cally, however, it continued to be
present, since numerous large factions, which were separated from
the main body, stayed behind. The reason for such detachments were
varied. First it was the general custom that migrating steppe peoples
must leave an adequate number of warriors and woman folk behind to
stand guard over the ancient land, upon which they could fall back,
should the search for new and better grazing land fail. Then, internal
political tensions may also have caused secessions. Furthermore, and
most frequently, they were exposed to enemy attacks which could cut
off thousands of people and sweep them away from the main block.
Larger Hungarian break-away tribes stayed behind in the following
areas: 1. in Caucasia, 2. in the Volga region, 3. in Touran and 4. in
Moldavia.
1. In Caucasia, the detached Hungarian tribes were those living
between the Kuma and Terek rivers, on the northwestern side of the
Caspian Sea, called Kum-Magaria. Bear witness of their tribulations
eight papal edicts (Bulls) granted between 1245 and 1291. Their texts
have been published by László Bendefy (P 010). Among the other
contemporary documents relating to the problem we can mention an
inscription carved on stone, found in the Crimean Peninsula and
deciphered by the author. Finally, tradition also deserves to be
mentioned, preserved by both the Danubian Hungarians and the
successors of Hungarians in the East. Amongst the most important
historical studies devoted to this question are the works of L. Bendefy
(P Oil) and János Boros (P 018). But in spite of this apparent richness
of documentation on this topic, many questions remain unanswered,
so that our account is still conjectural on several points.
The Caucasian Hungarians were characterized by the fact that they
lacked comprehensive political organization for a long time, having
lived in chaotic conditions, each of their clans and tribes by



themselves, in as many mini-states. With the emergence of the Mongol
threat, however, the feeling prevailed amongst them, that for their
mutual defense and survival, they must unite their forces. Accordingly,
they all placed themselves under the authority of King Yeretany. This
king wanted, above anything else, to give his kingdom a Christian
organization. Therefore, he turned for help to the Holy See, asking for
catholic priests. These antecedents led to the emission of a first papal
edict by John XXII, on behalf of the "most eminent Prince Yeretany."
We read the following passage in the said edict: "Greetings to our son
Yeretany and other Christian Hungarians (in Caucasia)... We have
understood that thou, my son Yeretany, who art a descendant from the
earliest Catholic kings of Hungary, wanted to receive, together with
other Christians of the said region... a Catholic missionary (doctorem
Catholicum desiratis habere>.)." The first "Catholic Doctor" arrived at
Magyar-on-the-Kuma in the person of Bishop Thaddeus (1331-1334).
He was followed by seven others, the last one holding office from
1366 to 1377. It is not known what became thereafter of Yeretany, but
his epitaph, found in the Crimea suggests, that he was himself a priest
and fled westwards, before the Mongol invasion. His inscription
actually reads thus: "Here is kept, by the Armenian monks, the holy
treasure of Yeretany, an Iranian lord and prince of the Don-bank. (This
treasure) consists of two church-cans. Great holiness was the
distinctive mark of this 'living God'." The dreaded onslaught of the
Mongol armies materialized in 1395/96, when the city of Magyar was
destroyed and the Kuma-Terek plain incorporated into the Kiptchak
Turk empire as a province. The few surviving Magyars then retreated
into the mountains and F. Nansen, the Norvégián explorer, was the last
European who spoke to their descendants in 1925.
2. The second and by far the largest Hungarian-speaking ethnic group,
that of the Volga Hungarians was detached from the main body
somewhere to the north of the Caspian sea in the Vlth century



following the attacks of the Turks, and was pushed northwards along
the river Volga. They were met be the imperial ambassador
Zemarchus, who talked with the "Prince of the Hungarians, who
reigned by the grace of Dizabuli khan" (On-gororum dux qui illic ex
auctoritate Dizabuli impérium habebat" (P 092 p. 93 f.). They were
then lost from sight and had no contact with any other Hungarian
group for about 600 years. They were rediscovered quasi accidentally
in 1236 by zealous Dominicans (Black Friars), who originally wanted
to find the Caucasian Hungarians, for they wanted to convert them to
the Christian faith. Four missionaries started on this venture in 1235,
via Constantinople. However, when they arrived at the city of Matrica
(the present Taman), at the entrance of the Maeotis (now Sea of
Azov), they altered their itinerary for an unknown reason and instead
of continuing eastwards, they turned directly to the north, journeying
along the west bank of the Volga. Finally, Friar Julian, the only
surviving priest, succeeded in finding a large Hungarian tribal group
"near the Great River Ethyl."
There is a report on this unique journey, written in the XHIth century
and submitted to the Holy See of Rome, where it is kept in the Record
Office. Its text is published in the collection of medieval writings
edited by Imre Szentpétery and is currently known as the "Richardus
report" (P 120 II pp. 535-542). This report describes the dramatic
encounter thus: "He (Friar Julian) found them near the great river
Ethyl ( = Volga). When they learned that he was a Christian
Hungarian, they were greatly pleased about his coming. He was
shown their houses and cottages and was pressed with questions
about the king and the realm of Christian Hungarians. To everything
he told them, about faith and other things, they listened attentively,
because their language was entirely Hungarian and they understood
him and he them (quia omnino habent Hungaricum idioma et intellige
bant eum et ipse eos'•)." Julianus then promptly returned to Hungary



to impart his important discovery to his brethren at home. In the next
year (1237), Julianus undertook a second journey to the Volga, but
was unable to reach the Ungarian settlement because the Mongolian
armies were already on the way to make new conquests. In that very
year, Hungary at the Volga had been destroyed, and the nation's ethnic
identity abolished for ever. The surviving individual Magyars were
scattered all around within a radius of about 200km, on the Volga
Heights, around the Pensa and Sura rivers, with some settlements at
Saratov, Tambov and Riazan. Today, their memory is kept alive by a
great number of place-names which include the Magyar name. The
local inhabitants remember that they have Hungarian blood in their
veins, but do not speak Hungarian any more; Turkish and/or Russian
being their language (P 019 p. 229 f.).
3. The Touranian Hungarians always lived somewhat apart from the
other Near Eastern Hungarians, to the east of the Caspian Sea, around
the Aral Sea and in the Oxus valley. In Hungarian chronicles, this is
the region which probably appears under the name of Magoria. This
ethnic group first attracted the attention of our historians in the last
century, when Kristóf Lukácsy devoted a fine work (P 092) to them in
1870. More recently, after World War II, the same area came once
again into the forefront of research, thanks to the insistence of Erik
Molnár, whose example was followed by Tibor Tóth, P.-T. Veres and Pál
Lipták, who all underscored the close connections of the Ura-lian
Hungarians with the Touranians. But it is Antal Bartha who deserves
the credit for having discovered the earliest role of the Touranians,
who were responsible for the civilization of the local population of the
Ural region and that of Western Siberia, in the Und millenium B. C.
The surviving traces of the lost Touranian Hungarians were also
carefully recorded (Kath. Magyarok Vasárnapja, January 12,1969;
Kanadai Magyarság, November 23,1968; Sorsunk, Sidney, February
13, 1960, etc.) and the villages, with 'Madiar' names, noted.



A major faction of Touranian Hungarians seem to have been swept far
away, towards southeastern Asia, into what is today New-Zealand,
where they continue to call themselves Maori (<Ma-Ur-i), i.e. Magyar.
Their existence has been discovered by F. A. Uxbond (alias Wilhelm
von Hevesy) in his sensational book, published in English in 1928 (P
130). This publication lists innumerable evidence to prove that the
Maori are closely related to the European Hungarians, both racially
and culturally. The Maori of to-day are highly civilized, but almost
entirely absorbed into their English-speaking surroundings. The
mystery of the origin of this ethnic faction has not yet been fully
elucidated, which is perhaps connected with the expansion of the
Kushan Empire.
4. Our record would not be complete without mentioning the break
away Hungarian group of Tchangos, now living in Moldavia, on the
other side of the Carpathians, near the rivers Tatros and Sereth,
numbering altogether 170,000 souls. The capital city of Moldavia is
Yassy, the Hungarian Jász-Város 'City of the Yazigues'. Their full story
is related in a recently published 1520-pages monumental
sociographic study, by Pál-Péter Domokos (P 043). The colony started
at the beginning of the Christian era, with a faction of Yazigues that
did not continue its journey into Hungary for reasons unknown to us,
but stayed behind, breaking all relations with their brethren who had
entered Hungary and settled there. The Yazigue colony of Moldavia
later received additional Hungarians, when the warlike Cuman-Turks
set up a principality in Moldavia, then Cumania. To protect Hungary
against the harassments of this pagan people, King András II (1205
1235) placed border-guards on both sides of the Carpathians, at
several points. As a further step toward their pacification, the
archbishop of Esztergom/Hungary, established missionaries in
Cumania, who converted the people to Christianity. The first bishop
had been installed at Milkó in 1227 and was followed by a new influx



of Magyars. Until 1410, five Hungarian bishoprics were erected. An
official census, carried out in the middle of the XVth century, found a
total population of 47,167 in Moldavia. Out of that number, over
20,000 were Catholic Hungarians. On the eve of World War II, the
Tchango-Magyars boasted 60 villages in the Tatros valley and 160
along the Sereth river.
When the northern corner of Moldavia, the district called Bukovina,
was annexed by the Aus-tro-Hungarian Monarchy, general András
Hadik transferred some Moldavian Hungarians into that district. Their
descendants, numbering 24,000 souls, were rapatriated into mother
land Hungary, during the second World War. All the other Tchango
Magyars continue to stay in the land, and are deprived of all cultural
facilities in their own language, not even having elementary
instruction, despite the fact that they are the native people of the land,
who settled there well before the arrival of the first Rumanians in the
XHIth century.
To sum up the sad history of the lost Hungarian tribes, we may say
that ethnographic factions, large or small, which broke away in Eastern
Europe from the main body of Hungarians, were able to retain their
identity for several centuries but most of them disappeared in the great
politico-military upheaval which was brought about by the Mongol
invasion in the XIIIth century.

____________________
1. We have reverted to the Aryan term, following the practice of many
scientists, who prefer it because its meaning is 'Men' (Wiro, Vir, Ar, Ur)
in most of the European languages (cf. P 130 p. 115).



2. The double racial origin of the Hungarians is first mentioned in the
Lacin language work of the sharp-eyed historian Deseritzky who said:
"Hunnos Magoresque gentem robustissimam et populosissimam
partim ex Japhet per Magog, partim ex Cham per Chus turn vero
Nemrothum fuisse propagatam et in unum coaluisse" (P 092 p. 79).
3. The head-shape is indicated by the cephalic index (CI). It is given in
percentage ratio (100) with the skull-width (W) and its greatest
length (L), from front to back, seen from above the head: CI= 100 X
(W:L). When its CI is 80.00 or more, the cranium is round, short or
brachy-cephalic. When CI is 75.00 or less, the cranium is long or
dolychocephalic. Between these two ranges are the meso-cephalic or
medium-headed elements.
4. E. Pittard: «Il me semble de plus en plus évident que les invasions
avares et magyares, qui apparaissent de beaucoup comme les plus
importantes, ne sont que deux
5. E. Pittard noticed the strong concentration of shortheaded Aryans
in the Ancient Near-East. He said: "En Asie, par exemple, parmi les
peuples divers que l'on a appelés les Aryens, et qui ont laissé le
souvenir de grandes civilisations, il y a beaucoup de brachycéphales,
d'Aryen brachycéphales" (P 103 p. 29).
6. It is important to keep in mind that, when our historical sources
mention the "dark" complexion of Kush, they do not always use this
word in a literal sense as 'black', but rather as opposed to white.
Further, the Kush must not be confused with Negroes, who are either
a distinct race, or a product of the jungle. Schuré insists upon this and
says: «Il faut en chercher le type supérieur non pas dans le Nègre
dégénéré, mais dans l'Abyssinien et le Nubien, en qui se conserve le
moule de cette race parvenue à son apogée» (P 114 p. 42).
7. In the first millenium A.D., almost every Eastern-Euro-pean nation



had some brownish-darkish complexioned ethnie elements in their
physical make-up. There were white and dark Huns, white and dark
Bulgars, white and dark Ugors, white and dark Chasars. It is
surprising that this all-important historical fact escaped the attention
of scientists, who persisted in believing that the adjectives White and
Dark, when employed in historical sources, in connection with ethnic
names, would signify the basic points: East and West, i.e. the
geographic position of the respective peoples. This is, of course, a
misinterpretation.
8. Chronicler Simon de Kéza accurately reflects the general feeling of
Hungarians against the dark coloured population by saying: "Gentes
siquidem in eadem (i.e. in Scythia) procreate otia complectuntur,
vanitatibus de-dite, nature dedignantis actibus venereis intendentes,
rapiñas amant, generaliter colore plus nigre quam albe" (P 120 I p.
252).
9. Former linguists and historians were inclined to consider the Kush
population as of Old Turkish extraction. It was, however, impossible to
find a fitting Turkish branch, or to determine the specific geographic
area where contacts between Hungarians and Turks might have taken
place. Above all, the beginning of the Kush-Hungarian relations
antedates the existence of any Turkish people. Therefore, the idea of
early Turkish-Hungarian connections had to be abandoned (see Prof.
Benko in P 009 p. 50).
10. The same opinion was expressed in a most recent German
language publication by Ferenc Kemény: "(Dass) das Ungarische
einerseits allen eurasischen Sprachen als Grundlage gedient hat,
andererseits eine echte Ursprache ist, deren Ursprung aus dem
heutigen Bestand derselben eindeutig erklaert werden kann (P 078 p.
115; see ibiden pp. 50, 61).



11. That Hungarian is an Aryan tongue par excellence, was stated
time and again by a number of linguists; most emphatically be Kristóf
Lukácsy, who said this: "When I say that Hungarian belongs to the
Aryan class of languages, I am summarizing the results of my
investigations of several years, conducted in the field of Hungarian
linguistics and antiquities" (P 092 p. 199).
12. "Aryan is the terminus technicus describing one of the great
language-groups extending from India to Europe" (P 038; see also
P133 and P 132). - Formerly, by mistake, the European languages
were collectively classified as Aryan. But their names do not include
the distinctive vocable Ari. Their kinship is based only upon the word
stock present in their substratum. — For the Aryan term, see also P
091 pp. 27-30; and Encycl. Britannica, ed. 1947, t. II p. 494.
13. "Ihm (Illitch-Switytch) war es gelungen, das System der
Lautentsprechungen zwischen den indoeuropäischen, den uralischen,
den altaischen... der khartweli-schen, den hamito-semitischen und
den dravidischen Sprachen zu erkennen. Diese Lautentsprechungen
beziehen sich auf Hunderte von Wortwurzeln einer eura-sischen
Ursprache deren man die Bezeichnung 'nostra-tisch' oder 'boreisch'
gab, — writes Dolgopolski in his German language account (P 042).
— See also the Hungarian complement to this study by Gy. Hary in
Valóság (Budapest, October 1976, p. 177). - Dolgopolski continues
thus: "Als Urheimat der boreischen Sprache, kommt nach allem, was
wir heute wissen, der Raum von Indien, und von Kaukasien bis zum
Persischen Golf, in Frage." - "Die boreische Sprachgemeinschaft muss
demnach in der mittleren Steinzeit, vor Beginn der Jungsteinzeit,
bestanden haben..." (P 042).
14. «Le nom du peuple Aryen reste jusqu'à présent sans explication
certaine» (P 091 p. 75).



15. Bird-headed statuettes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia
already from the time of the Flood (P 006 I p. 56). In Hungary too,
bird-headed bone-sticks have been found on several sites (P 050 p.
258).
16. Most of the Oriental place - and ethnic names with a Hungarian
meaning have been collected from the following five publications: P
013; P 021; P 024; P 044; and P 085. Some others were found in the
works of Herodotus, Dauzat, Uxbond, Saks, etc.
17. Toppeltinus: "...etiamnum vocantur Magori. Ingens populus et ipsi
armorum gloria inclytum regnum possi-dent" (P 092 pp. 98, 203).
18. L.A. Waddell comments Barat-Varsha thus: "The Land of the Barats
(Barat Varsha) a name synonymous with 'Barat Ana' or 'Land of the
Barats', which I have proved to be the original form of the name 'Brit
Ain' as given to Albion about 1100 B.C. by... the same Aryan race of
Barats... who civilized India and the Ganges valley" (P 132 bis p. 10);
see also the entry under 'Barata Varsha' in P 044).
19. "They called it /Egypt/ the land of Mezor ( = Magyar) and the
land of Cham / = Kush/ from their two ancestors, which the Greek
rendered Mesora and Chamia" (P 023 p. 298). — The same idea is
expressed in the following quotation "Throughout the early dynastic
period and the Old Kingdom /of Egypt/ Set (= the dark ruler ) and
Horus (the Aryan ruler) are represented as the two patron-deities of
the Monarchy" (John Van Saters, The Hyksos, London 1966 p. 98).
20. The transliteration of carved signs into Roman characters is
usually done 1. with capital letters for the graphically expressed
sounds; and 2. with small characters for the sounds supplied by the
decipherer. And 3. in our transliterations a dot is inserted between the
elements of every combined sound-sign. 4. The omitted consonants or
words are given in parentheses (), while 5. the broken-off and missing



signs are in brackets /.../.
21. The word Pogány 'Pagan' originates from the Latin Pagus 'Village'
and Paganus 'Villager', signifying 'People living in the countryside.' In
the Middle Ages, the same word was, however, used in a pejorative
sense to say 'uneducated, backward, despicable', especially when
speaking of non-Christian people. The alternative word for Pagan is
Heathen. It is probably derived from the Old Hungarian word Héth
'Seven', a shortened from of the expression 'Follower of the Seven
Great Gods.'
22. Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of the cruel
treatment King St. Stephen inflicted upon Thonuzoba who "stubbornly
adhering to his beliefs, was unwilling to become a Christian, and was
buried alive with his wife" (P 120 I p. 117). A similar cruel
punishment was imposed upon a woman, Raski by name, who was
prominent in a heathen uprising: "(She) was captured by the very
Christian King Béla and confined in prison until she ate her own feet,
and also died in the same place" (P 120 I p. 398). Persecutions of
adherents to the old faith continued until about the middle of the
XHIth century, the last dreaded inquisitor having been Johannes
Theuthon (+1252), commissioner of the Holy See to several Central
European states (P 047).
23. King Saint Stephen mentions in his gift-charter granted to the
nuns of Veszprém-Valley: "Ibi stat meta lapidea, que volgo Baluan
vocatur," "There stands a boundary-stone, called Idol by the local
population." ― Similarly, King András I ordered in his edict of 1047:
"Falsos deos abrogare et Simulacra demoliri", "to suppress the false
gods and to destroy the idols" (P 082 p. 367).
24. A witness who attended a meeting of wise-men, testified before
the Christian inquisitor by saying: "Wiseman Bansa climbed to the top



of a high ladder, stayed there for a while, chatting with God and, back
on earth, he foretold the future to his audience" (P 047 p. 56).
25. "Each time a Pharaoh was conceived, Ra was said to have returned
to earth to espouse the queen' (P 045 p. 50).
26. The corresponding passage by Anonymus reads thus: "matri eius
pregnanti per sompnium apparuit divina visio in forma Asturis que
quasi veniens earn gravidavit et innotuit ei quod de utero eius
egrederetur torrens et de limbis eius reges gloriosi propagarentur" (P
120 I p. 38).
27. "erat enim ipse Almus facie decorus sed niger, nigros habebat
oculos sed magnos, statura longus et gracilis, manus vero habebat
grossas et digitos prolixos" (P 120 I p. 38).
28. The grandson of Prince Arpad, Taksony, was of white complexion,
while Arpad's great-grandson took after him: "He had beautiful big
eyes and soft dark hair". Certain kings of the dynasty were of very
high stature, as, for example, St. Stephen, King András I, St. Ladislas
and King Béla III.
29. Prof. Gardiner states that the Egyptian Arpad may have been
"perhaps the first to become ruler upon earth over the autochthonous
Egyptians, after whom followed Osiris and the Horus" (P 052 p.
*110).
30. See the following references: P 052 I pp. *14 - *19, "103 and
*108; and P 026 II 94 - 100, 109, 153 and 374. -If the Sumerian name
for Earth was also Pat, Pot, the Sumerian ruler's title Pat-Esi (=H. Föld
Őse) also meant 'Land Ancestor' or 'Land Lord'.
31. Many rulers of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty had throne-names
with a clear Oriental meaning, and this explains why certain names



appear so often, like István (five times) and Béla (four times). In the
Old Hungarian spelling István or Están was the word for Isten 'God'.
Béla (in O.H. Bala, Baal, Bika) was the Syrian name for Great-God.
They were used in an abridged form, all bearing testimony that their
wearers were 'Living Gods', i.e. Gods on Earth, exactly as was the
practice in the Ancient Orient.
32. Babylon was surrounded by seven walls; the Mesopotamian
Ziggurat had seven floors; Mesopotamian noblemen wore seven
ruffled kilts; Egypt had seven great gods; the Egyptian Heaven had
seven divisions; the Hittite Empire (the Biblical Héth) started with the
fusion of seven lands; the Etruscan nation began with the federation
of seven cities; Rome was built on seven hills; etc. etc.
33. According to Prof. Áldásy, the double-cross cannot be considered
an apostolic cross; this latter was always a single cross (P 001 p. 63).
Thus, he indirectly admits the pre-Christian origin of this important
symbol.
34. The best edition of the medieval national chronicles is that of
Emericus Szentpétery, former professor at Budapest University (F 120
I-II).
35. "Et primus rex Scythiae fuit Magog filius Japhet, et gens ilia a
Magog rege vocata est Moger", ― writes Anonymus (P 120 I p. 35).
36. On these conflicting views see, particularly, the Chroni-con Pictum
(P 120 I pp. 243-250, and the Hungarian translation: P 053 pp. 35
37).
37. No Hungarian historian has taken notice until now that Egyptian
literature also know of a hunting hero, Onuris by name (like the
Hungarian Hunor), who had a mate called Mehit, 'lioness'. See the
somewhat confused passage in P 032 p. 227, which reads: "His



(Onuris') cult figure was a man wearing a long skirt, his feet poised
well apart, to enable him to aim a spear downwards at some
monstrous foe. His worship was centred in Thinis, a district which also
included Abydos." The Coffin Texts, III 334 j. are given as reference.
38. The original wording is thus: 'Ubi propter intemperiem illius zonae
sunt serpentes diversi generis, ranae velut porci, basilisci, et plura
animalia toxicata; tigris et unicornis ibi generantur." Where gold,
silver and pearls are also to be found (P 120 I p. 253. See also P 130
p. 164, where another location is suggested).
39. This is the opinion of many international authorities, like C.
Dawson who writes this: "It is certainly in the Danubian region that
we find (in Europe) the most complete and typical example of any
early peasant culture" (P 039 p. 53). And H. T. Waterbolk: "(Toward
3000 B.C.), the Hungarian Plain was a dominant centre which had
incorporated all the major achievements of the nuclear area in the
Near East and which had added to these an adaptation to the
European deciduous forest" (P 134).
40. for the westward diffusion of the Hungarian Neolithic and Bronze
Age civilizations see, in addition to the quoted references in the text,
in particular P 039 pp. 51 and 169.
41. In the light of the etymology given there, we have to abandon the
fantastic explanation of the Greek writers of the past, who believed
that the Italian Siculi were governed by One-Eyed Giants, interpreting
the Syc-Lo-Pe expression as being the Greek word Cyclops.
42. Thukydides relates that "the country owes its name of Italy to
Italus, a king of Sicel, so called." Now, Ital, as a Hungarian word,
means a 'drink', and Italos somebody 'fond of alcoholic drink'. The
explanation seems to be a fitting one, because the early Sicels are said
to have been fond of wine, which they drank in the Scythian fashion,



i.e. unmixed with water (P 067 Book VI cap. 84 and Book I cap. 106).
― Incidentally, the Greek name of Sungod, Apollo, is, in their
language, a Hungarian loan-word, made up with Pe + Ló, and the
prefixed definitive article A, whence A Pe-Lo, contracted into Apollo,
literally means 'The Chief Horse'.
43. Prof. Hood is reluctant to see actual writing upon the tablets: "But
do the Tartaria ( = Tatárlaka) tablets actually bear writing? Probably
not... It seems quite possible that they were merely an
uncomprehending imitation of more civilized peoples' written
records... a pretense by some illiterate barbarian to command the
magic embodied in an art he had witnessed but did not understand"
(P 068).
44. The calendar was a precious instrument in the hands of every
farming community of the Antiquity. It enabled the peasants to know
the most appropriate time to carry out certain important tasks, such as
plowing and sowing in particular and it was also useful for the timing
of religious festivals.
45. In Atlantic Europe, the observation of the various seasonal
positions of the Sun, in reference to the zodiacal star-clusters, was
made with the help of heavy megalith-ic structures (e.g. Stonehenge).
In the Danubian region, the more advanced microlithic structure
prevailed. This is the significant difference between the two halves of
Europe, although this has never been pointed out until now.
46. The step-by-step explanation of the inscription is thus: in the
second compartment we can distinguish the rising Sun, in Hungarian
A Nap. On its right side, the contours of a mouse (H.: Az Egér) are
visible, with its thin, long tail. The picture of this animal is here
because it is homophonous with the expression Az Égre, 'to the sky'.
So, the thus far deciphered words say this: A Nap az Égre 'The Sun to



the sky'. After that, we read the signs placed in the left and right
columns, saying: the cross sign iT, the crab A RÁK, followed by a sign
for the sound-group KUR/KOR, and finally the word for donkey IÁ. In
modern Hungarian: Itt a rákkor jö 'Comes at this spot in the Cancer
constellation'. The directive continues in the third compartment thus:
aN-aP Je-Le aR-áK öV-Be... 'The day's symbol in the Cancer zone is...
The complete message in better English reads: 'Here (at Tatárlaka) the
Sun appears on the horizon in the Cancer constellation on the day of...
― The homophony existing between 'Sky God' (Az Égúr) and the
mouse (Az Egér) was probably the origin of the never-explained
Oriental custom of keeping white mice in Sun-temples, as was the
case in Babylon and Egypt. The presence of these small animals was a
mean amongst a hundred others, to remind the believers that God
may hide himself in any of his creatures to watch over their behaviour.
47. «La science considére aujourd'hui que les Celtes ne constituent pas
une race, dans le sens propre du terme mais ont toujours été un
groupe de peuples, formánt un agrégat de types du point de vue
anthropologique» (P 057 p. 10; and see P 070 I p. X and P 132 p.
128).
48. The thesis of the linguistic unity of Celtic Europe is stressed by
almost every author, as for example P 037 p. 12; P 057 pp. 10-12; P
070 I pp. 49, 51. The hundred million Celts are mentioned in the
publication P 057 p. 11.
49. Henri Hubert consoles himself by saying: «Rien d'étonnant que ces
noms soient difficile á expliquer et que leur sens etymologique se soit
évanoui» (P 070 I p. 27 f.).
50. "Erat enim rex Ethele colore teter, oculis nigris et furiosis, pectore
lato, elatus incessu, statura brevis, barbam prolixam gum Hunnis
deferebat" (P 120 I p. 151).



51. Author Agathias writing about the Hunnorum Gens says this: "Hi
vero omnes communiter Scythae et Hunni vocabantur, privátim
autem, secundum nationes alii aliter ex patria cuique et usita
appellatione nominaban-tur", quoted by P 092 p. 130.
52. "Mensa erat tota aurea, vasa etiam coquinaria aurea erant",
records Simon de Kéza (P 120 I p. 262).
53. Clenodia aurea que a tempore regis Ungariae Attila et ab aliis
successoribus suis usque nunc in Ungaria fuerant conservata" (P 099
p. 187 f.).
54. It should be noted, once again, that the ancient royal Egyptian
symbols also included the bird, the whip and the bee.
55. Incidentally, ancient Egyptian kings had the same custom: "The
warrior kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties were pleased when
the court scribes related in commemorative inscriptions how their
lords raged and roared like lions as they mounted their chariots and
set out to crush the foolish enemy" (P 026 I p. 25 f.)
56. "Sie besassen keine Sprache, sondern stiessen kurze, rauhe Laute
aus, wie Tiere auf der Flucht" (P 113 p. 17).
57. "Sie sind treuer and harter als die Germanen, sie kennen nichts als
den König" (P 113 p. 130).
58. "Der Name Attila ist heute zweifelsfrei als Germanisch 'Váterchen'
erkannt", Die Presse, Stuttgart, 20, May 1975.
59. The Swiss anthropologist E. Pittard was one of the first scientists
to suspect the close affinity of the early inhabitants of Hungary. He
said: «I1 est probable, á voir les caractéres morphologiques des
habitants de la Hongrie, que parmi les peuples qui arrivaient de l'Est,



il y en avait plusieurs qui étaient puisés aux mémes fonds ethniques
que les Magyars eux-mémes» (P 103 p. 341).
60. Several examples can be listed to prove that Horse (Lau) was used
to say Ra, the Sungod. In the Zagros mountains, to the east of
Mesopotamia, there was a small country called Lauristan (<H.: Ló-Ur
Isten), 'Land placed under the protection of the Horse-Lordgod' i.e.
Sungod. It was the unique task of the Scythians who lived in that
country to raise horses for the Persian armies. Their popular art was
also overladen with horse representations. — Another example: The
Armenian bishop, Israyel, who travelled into the land of the Huns and
described their beliefs, said this: "The Huns worshipped their highest
divinity in the form of a giant warrior, mounted on horseback" (P 081
p. 65). - The Hungarian AU sound usually changes into 0, as in the
city-name of Iglau, which is in modern Hungarian, Igló.
61. Originally, the eastern border lands of Germany (the future
Austria) were a creation of Frankish rulers. They were re-established
later, as duchies of Carinthia (976), Carniola (1040), Styria (1055)
and Ostmark (1156).

PART TWO
THE GENESIS OF THE
DANUBIAN HUNGARIANS
THE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE HUNGARIANS
1. Implantation of the Higher Civilization into the Danubian basin
1. "Higher Civilization" is the comprehensive term for the major
material and spiritual innovations made by man during the Neolithic
and Bronze Ages. It signifies a settled way of life characterized by
food-production through agricultural activity and stock-breeding. In
view of the scarcity or total absence of contemporary written
evidences, this early period of human life is usually reconstructed with
the help of its material remains, whose study is archaeology. In the
following account, we frequently use another scientific term as well,
which is "historical Hungary". It means the unitary area of Central
Europe which is bounded on three sides — north, east and southeast
— by the Carpathian mountain ranges, in the south by the Low
Danube and the river Sava, and to the west by the first elevations of
the Alps (Fig. 1). After its principal mountain-range and principal
river, it is also known as the "Carpathian Land" and "Middle Danube
basin", or, more precisely, the "Carpatho-Danubian area". For over a



thousand years (until 1920), this area formed a single political entity,
the Kingdom of Hungary.
'Historical Hungary' is rich in archaeological remains. The most
significant finds which were made there until the mid-fifties, have
been described by Edith B. Thomas in her German language
Archaeologische Funde in Ungarn (P 125). Since that time the soil has
yielded so much valuable new material that this basic work needed to
be completed. The two most important complementary publications
are from Nándor Kalicz: Archaeology of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages
in Hungary, in Hungarian (P 074) and Neolithic Finds at Méhtelek (also
in H., P 075). The international connections of the Hungarian New
Stone Age have first been recognized by Gordon Childe in his
fundamental work The Danube in Prehistory (P 031), while the great
role the Middle Danube area played in spreading Higher Civilization
westward, has been summarized by Jacquetta Hawkes in several of
her comprehensive studies (P 064; P 065 and P 066). The excellent
maps of H. T. Waterbolk (P 134), showing the diffusion of food
production-methods, especially into Europe, are indispensable even
for the student of Hungarian archaeology. These publications may give
the reader a perfectly clear idea and up-to-date information about the
various archaeological aspects of early Hungary.
2. Neolithic agriculture found very favourable conditions in Hungary,
where it flourished rapidly, especially on the great Central Plain and
where mighty rivers — the Danube, Tisza, Maros and Körös — assure
abundant year-round water supply. Moreover, Hungary has extensive
loess soil, which is easily handled, even with primitive implements,
because it consists of very minute, windblown particles of high
capillarity. In addition to agriculture, breeding of domestic animals
(cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and dogs) played an important part in early
food-production. In this regard, a long-horned, Oriental cattle-race
deserves special mention because their descendants can be admired



even today in the Hortobágy National Park near Debrecen.
Manufacturing of pottery, spinning and weaving were the most
important industrial activities. Large vases were made for storage
purposes, smaller ones for every-day use, while ceramic statuettes and
other artistic products satisfied the needs of the Church. Timbered
houses above the ground and small, self-sufficient villages, as well as
incipient writing completed the Neolithic way of life in early Hungary.
There are over 200 known sites that bear testimony of the material
remains of Hungarian Higher Civilization. All were located on virgin
soil, i.e. they form the oldest layer in excavated sites. This is an
important fact because it indicates that there is no trace of previous
more primitive food-production in the Carpatho-Danubian area.
There, the Neolithic appears unprecedented and suddenly, in a fully
developed form. Consequently, this was not a phenomenon of local
origin but was caused by immigrants coming from another region.
The Neolithic Age began in Hungary in the fifth millenium B.C. It first
appeared along the Körös river, in the central part of the Great Plain,
hence its name: Körös culture. It remained the dominant neolithic
group for a period of over a thousand and five hundred years, until
about 3200 B.C. and has left lasting marks upon all subsequent,
similar Danubian cultures. The most sensational remains of the Körös
culture have come to light at Méhtelek in 1973. This tiny village is in
the Upper Szamos valley in an isolated location: about 200 km away
from the centre of this culture. This unique location is explained by
the presence of enormous quantities of obsidian, a very precious
industrial material during that epoch, for whose exploitation a whole
colony was set up. In order to fathom how important this exploitation
was, it is significant that the five pits which were open so far by
archaeologists yielded several thousand raw lumps and finished
wares, as compared with barely a hundred which were previously
inventoried for all of Hungary. Another surprise: nearly sixty Venus



statuettes were dug out in that area, as compared with a total of forty
that were previously discovered. No other such rich obsidian centre
has ever been found elsewhere in Europe (P 096 and P 075).
During the era of the Körös culture, Transdanubia and Upper Hungary
were covered with another neolithic culture, the so-called Danube-I,
radiocarbon-dated c. 4430 B.C. From its decorated pottery, it is also
known as Linear Pottery Culture, or Bandkeramik and its preference for
loess soil is particularly visible. A third major Hungarian neolithic
culture was the Banatian culture (c. 3200 B.C.-2300 B.C.), which
included the Transylvanian Olt basin (Erősd) and formed a link with
the more extensive Tripolje culture in Eastern Europe, famous for its
painted pottery. The fourth was the Tisza culture (c. 2800 B.C.-c. 2500
B.C.) which produced the finest and most valuable pottery. The fifth
or last one was the Péceli culture (c. 2100 B.C.-1900 B.C.). It already
covered the whole territory of Hungary and the Vienna and Moravian
basins as well.
Hungary's five neolithic cultures cover an uninterrupted period of over
two millenia and show a surprisingly high degree of uniformity over
the whole area. They have successfully incorporated almost all the
material and spiritual innovations of the world's first Higher Civilization
which flourished in the Ancient Near East, and became a secondary
centre of diffusion for the benefit of all central and north-western Europe.
(39)
3. Metal-using cultures appeared in Hungary in the middle of the IIIrd
millenium. The first period, from c. 2500 B.C., is characterized by an
abundant use of copper and gold; the second, from c. 1900 to 800
B.C. by its preference for bronze. Hungarian archaeologists therefore
like to speak of separate Copper and Bronze Ages, yet the two periods
constitute but a single one, bronze being an alloy of 90% copper with
10% tin or antimony. That Hungary was capable of developing a



brilliant metallurgy before any other European country is due to the
rich copper mines in her mountains, and the abundance of alluvial
gold deposited in the tributary streams of the Tisza.
A good illustration of Hungary's richness in precious metals at that
time is the gold plate of Mojgrád in Szilágy county (Fig. 25). It weighs
750 gr and reflects a neolithic pattern, insofar as only the eyes and the
nose are represented on it, while the mouth is omitted. The plate was,
in all probability, a sacred object whose brilliant face represented the
Sungod. It may have been the identification plate of a high priest
when officiating. The most distinctive Hungarian product was,
however, the hammer-axe, with a disc for the butt (Fig. 26). It was a
native form, derived from an earlier copper shaft-hole axe, this last
being the derivative of a stone axe. The metallurgic centres of
Hungary were so productive that they literally inundated
contemporary markets with their daggers, swords, spears, arrow
heads, goblets and bracelets. The proper evaluation of Hungary's
metallurgical activities, both in the Copper and Bronze Ages, can be
derived from Prof. Dawson's remarks, who summed up his findings
thus: "It is clear that during this period Hungary was the centre of a
brilliant development of culture which, from the artistic point of view,
surpassed anything that existed elsewhere in Central Europe... The
splendid Hungarian swords and axes, often ornamented with elaborate
spiral decorations, are perhaps the finest specimens of European bronze
work, and supplied the models for similar types of the Nordic Bronze
Age" (P 039 p. 326).

great demand in the Bronze Age.
4. As already pointed out, the neolithic way of life was not indigenous
to Hungary, but came from an outside geographic area. According to
our present knowledge, this can but be the Ancient Near-East, where
all the wild ancestors of domesticated plants and animals were
present and where food-production was achieved at an earlier date.
The accuracy of this fact has subsequently been proven with
comparative archaeology. Scholars of that study discovered, indeed, a
strong affinity, both in form and style, between the earliest Hungarian
artifacts and their Oriental counterparts. It was, in particular, noticed
that the Hungarian axes strongly resembled those found in the Royal
Cemetery of Ur, that Transylvanian sickles originated from
Mesopotamian forms and that the oldest Hungarian pottery was
similar to that found in the oldest layers of the ruins of Ur, Kish, Assur
and other ancient cities of Mesopotamia. Concordances found in the
Nile valley were just as convincing: long-horned Egyptian cattle,
native of the Delta, survives 3000 years later in the Hungarian
National Park of Hortobágy. In the same park, specimens can be seen
of a special breed of sheep with twisted horns, spread horizontally at
an angle of about 120 degrees, now called Racka. In ancient Egypt
these sheep were sacred to the God Khum, the ram-headed divinity.
This race has since become extinct there. In the grave of King
Hasekhe-mui of the Second Dynasty (c. 2703 B.C.-2686 B.C.) a gold



object was found, whose material may originally have come from
Hungary. It is indeed covered with a thin layer of antimony (Sb) and
tellurium (Te) which occur only in the gold of the Carpathian basin.
Another proof of the ancient Egypto-Hungarian connections is the
splendid jar found in Egyed, in Sopron county. The God Thot
recording the sins of the deceased is depicted on its sides.
The civilization of the ancient Near-East embraced not only
Mesopotamia and Egypt, which we just mentioned, but Syria and
Anatolia as well, with which countries the Carpatho-Danubian region
was already directly connected. Such contacts were numerous, as
shown by two enormous rapiers, over 90 cm in length, which were
found in the heart of Transylvania. They correspond exactly to the so
called Shardina-sword from Palestine (now in the British Museum).
There were also bracelets and beads made from Mediterranean shells.
Moreover, certain idols of Hungary are the exact duplicates of those
found on the Island of Cyprus (Élet és Tudomány, 1974 no. 38). The
Boghaz-Kői (Hittite) pottery designs from the XIVth century B.C. had
their duplicates in the Maros valley in Hungary. Hungarian gourd
shaped vessels were like Cappadocian specimens, while Hungarian
bronze jars found in Ózd near Miskolc, and elsewhere, were similar to
their Trojan prototypes from around 2100 B.C. And the gold plate
from Mojgrád shows a close resemblance to a similar figure from Troy
II. Thus Higher Civilization from the Orient reached Hungary
overland, through the Balkan corridor formed by the narrow valleys of
the Vardar and Morava rivers. This route was in use for over two
thousand years and its importance only began to decline after the fall
of Troy II, c. 1200 B.C. The route has been practically closed since the
Vllth century B.C.
In spite of the close links with its Oriental model, the Higher
Civilization of Hungary was not a simple copy of it, since it could
boast of several original features. One of the most important of these



was dry-farming. As a matter of fact, the Hungarian rivers, unlike
those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, had no regular floods. Therefore,
production by irrigation was not practised to a great extent here.
Instead, the Danubian farmers selected the windblown, porous loess
soil for cultivation, after having cleared it of its small growth. Later,
with the appearance of metallic tools and other more efficacious
agricultural implements (plough), it was possible to include heavier
but better clay soil as well into the cultivated area. Thanks to this and
to similar inventions, Danubian farmers were highly superior in
production to those on the Balkans, including Greece. The adaptation
to European environment was a significant innovation; it opened the
door for Hungarian farmers to spread out westwards, into Central and
Western Europe.
Besides the Danubian Neolithic, early Europe possessed two other
neolithic cultures: the Tripolje or Black Earth culture, with its painted
pottery, and the Lake Dwelling culture in Switzerland. The first one
unfolded in Eastern Europe, between the Dnieper and the Low
Danube. Its exact origin is still unknown, although it is certain that it
owed its existence to the same source that gave rise to the Danubian
neolithic civilization. The Tripolje culture disappeared, however, quite
soon after the so-called Battle-axe people appeared, whereas the Lake
Dwelling, on account of its very special conditions, could not be
introduced elsewhere. As a result, the Hungarian or Danubian
neolithic culture remained without rival in central and western
Europe. This privileged situation explains its lasting influence over
vast areas for about two thousand years. The westward extension of
the Danubian civilization proceeded along the Danube and its
interconnections on the one hand, and along the Vistula and Oder on
the other. In the words of Prof. G. Childe: "for over two thousand years
it (the Danube) formed the channel by which the influence of the Higher
Civilization of the Eastern Mediterranean basin, including Anatolia and



Syria, was transmitted to the barbarian North and even to distant
Britain" (P 073 p. 413).(40)
2. The advent of the first sedentary population
1. In the two thousand years immediately preceding the Neolithic Age
from c. 5500 B.C. to 3500 B.C., neither the Middle Danube basin nor
Central Europe in general had any permanent population (P 134).
This fact excludes the possibility that the Danubian cultural and
technical upswing might have been the result of borrowing through
commercial contacts, no one being present at the receiving end. It is
therefore generally assumed that the introduction of the Higher
Civilization in the Carpatho-Danubian area was the work of actual
colonization by immigrant farmers and metal workers.
In fact, the first colonists began to reach Hungary immediately after
the climatic change, in the so-called Subboreal Period. During that
period the average rainfall was less than today, and the yearly
temperature was 7°C above the present average. With the increasing
dryness, dense forests thinned out, marshes shrank to a smaller size or
even disappeared, more room becoming available for ethnic
movements. The Vardar-Morava corridor, which cuts the Balkans right
in half, opened up and funnelled migrant groups of cultivators and
herdsmen in an ever increasing number into Hungary. The bulk of
migrants came from the western parts of the Ancient Near East: from
Syria and Anatolia, although the original point of departure of many of
them was Mesopotamia and Egypt.
The described ethnic movement can best be followed with the study of
old place-names, the 'toponymy'. Its usefulness for detecting ethnic
movements stems from the general human behaviour that immigrants,
as soon as they settle in a free place, give names to the surrounding
geographic features. When correctly interpreted, these names may



disclose the geographic origin of the first colonists, the time of their
arrival, the state of their civilization, their language, their ethnic
appurtenance, and even the area of colonization in the new land. For
all these advantages, toponymy has become one of the most
productive subsidiary branches of history; it may open "dazzling
perspectives," — as the French linguist Albert Dauzat expressed it (P
037 p. 70). The historical interpretation of place-names needs,
however, a very careful analysis, because they were themselves subject
to phonetical distortions, following the various sound-shifts, the vowel
harmony and the shifting of accent. Therefore the first task of the
toponymist consists of elucidating the oldest spelling of a given place
name, which usually conserves the original meaning of the name most
clearly. In this respect, however, the effective contribution of
Hungarian linguists to our knowledge in this particular field was, until
recently inadequate, due to their rather conservative frame of mind
(cf. P 009 p. 56 f.). Under these circumstances, this author had to
supply the basic documentation for this chapter.
2. A first group of Hungarian place-names, throwing light upon the
geographic origin of her inhabitants, includes such names that are
identical to those of their previous dwelling places. The immigrants,
indeed, make use of the same vocabulary in christening, to which they
were accustomed. This habit is verifiable even in our days, and it
explains why we have so many 'London', 'Paris', 'Athens' and other
European names in America, duplicating the toponymy of their former
country. In a similar way, there is, in Hungary, a series of place-names
which are repetitive to those of Anatolia, Syria, Mesopotamia and
Egypt. Let us quote a few such names. First, the name of Troy (anc.
Turia), in western Anatolia, also occurs in Hungary as Torja and Tiirje.
The name of Arzawa in southern Anatolia is duplicated in southern
Hungary as Orsova. The Phoenician city of Arad has its Hungarian
namesake in the great city of Arad. Two Hungarian villages called



Haláp (located in the counties of Zala and Bihar) correspond to the
important city of Haleb (today: Aleppo). The Syrian Bukk valley has its
namesake in Hungary in the Bükk mountain and Bükk town. The
Palestinian Pilis country or Pilis-Ta is identical to the Hungarian Pilis
name, used as a county, mountain and village name. The Palestinian
river Kishont also re-appears in Hungary in the same form as Kishont,
a county-name.
The list of similar place-names continues with Egyptian and
Mesopotamian names. Ancien Egypt had a border-land called Zala or
Sala. It was a marshy region in the north-eastern Delta, where a
fortress was located to guard the military road to Syria. The same
name occurs in Hungary, in both forms as Zala and Sala, a county
which formerly resembled a marshy border-land in its southern parts.
Egypt's Nitra is duplicated in Hungary with Nyitra (anc. Nitra) as a
county, city and river name. The southern part of the Sinai peninsula,
under Egyptian rule since the unification of the "Two Lands" in c. 3200
B.C., was known as Bakon; its Hungarian homonym is also Bakony, a
forested area to the northwest of the Balaton Lake. Even Egyptian
king-names were used as Hungarian place-names, so that Tata, Papa
and Menes are Tata, Pápa, Ménes, Ménfő, Ménfa.
There are several duplicates of the Mesopotamian river names in
Hungary. E. g. Kherka and Sajur, both tributaries of the Tigris, appear
in Hungary as Kerka and Sajó. The Mesopotamian native name of the
land beyond the river Euphrates was Burattu; its Hungarian
equivalent is Berettyó. The Hungarian Karas, Körös and Krassó
correspond to the Mesopotamian Karasu. Finally, northern
Mesopotamia was called Subaru and Subartu to which the Hungarian
Szabar village-names in the Vas, Györ and Nógrád counties
correspond, as well as Sabaria, the capital city of former Pannónia.
Such parallels are not merely coincidental, since certain Arab
historical sources mention that the Hungarians were formerly called



by the ethnic name Sabartoi-Asphaloi.
A second series of Near-Eastern — Hungarian common place-names
are those that contain the name of an Oriental pagan divinity. We have
already mentioned some of them in a previous chapter dealing with
mythology. So it suffices here to remind the reader that the most
frequent divine names in question are the Sungod's various names,
such as 'lord' {Ur, Ra); 'Eye God' {Szemes); 'Sky God' (Ég-Ur); 'The
Enthroned God' (Szék-Ur); 'Heavenly Horse' {Égi Ló). The second
popular pagan divinity whose name is used in Hungarian place-names
is Bál (Baal), the Syrian Fire God. Places bearing the name of this god
are most frequent in the southern half of the country, in the Balaton
Lake area and in Transylvania. This regrouping suggests that the Baal
worshipping colonists may have arrived after the Sun-worshippers.
The third most frequently occurring divinity name was that of the God
Thot, protector of arts and letters in Egypt. Finally, a third series of
Hungarian place-names of Near Eastern origin are those which are
formed with Oriental ethnic or tribal names. These are e.g. Hetés or
Hetis, meaning 'Seven Ancestors' and Hetény, recalling the descendants
of the Hittites, who were led by exactly seven (Héth) princes. Another
Oriental ethnic name is Pilis, which was already mentioned. These
three series of specific Hungarian place-names — duplicating names,
divine names and ethnic names — prove that ancient Hungary received
the greater part of its first permanent population from the Ancient Near
East during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. The first wave was made up
mostly of agriculturists coming into the Carpatho-Danubian area
through the Balkan corridor of the Vardar-Morava valleys.
3. Having clarified the geographic origin of Hungary's first sedentary
population, our attention will be focussed next upon their territorial
expansion in the land. Our research in this connection is based partly
upon the three series of place-names just discussed, and partly upon
place-names which include one of the following six Old Hungarian



formative suffixes denoting dwelling places: 1. Ta (variant: Da)
meaning 'Land'; 2. Hon (var. On, An, Ony) 'Home'; 3. Szék (var. Szeg,
Szik) 'Residence'; 4. Kö (var. Ka, Ke, Kev) literally 'Stone', also 'Village';
5. Pis (>Biz, Viz) 'Water'; and 6. Mat (var. Ma, Mad, Mata) 'Field'.
Proof of the great antiquity of these six formative suffixes is the fact
that today they are no longer used for name-giving purposes, that they
are common in the entire Finno-Ugric language group and that the
words in question were in continuous use in the Ancient Orient since
the IIIrd millenium B.C. at least.
We begin our illustration with the word Ta. It occurs in the following
Near Eastern place-names: Pilis-Ta, Heti-Ta, Cre-Ta, Kushi-Ta, Subar
Tu, Urar-Tu, etc. In European Hungary the following names are
formed with the same element: Ágo-Ta, Bago-Ta, Bak-Ta, Bó-Ta,
Bucsu-Ta, Cinko-Ta, Csaj-Ta, Csász-Ta, Galán-Ta, Ino-Ta, Kádár-Ta,
Kalo-Ta, Laj-Ta, Panko-Ta, Pilis-Ta, Pusz-Ta; further: Ab-Da, An-Da, Or
Da, Ra-Da, Tor-Da, Var-Da. The suffix Hon (frequently without the first
letter, H) was also common in place-names both in the Near East as
well as in Hungary. In the Orient the most widely known such names
are: Ir-An (<Ur-Hon), Tour-An (<Tó-Ur-Hon), Makr-An (< Magyar
Hon), and Macar-On ( = Magyar Hon); and in Hungary: Bak-On, Bak
Ony, Balat-On (<Bál-Ott-Hon), Mos-Ony, etc. Place-names to which
the formative suffix Szék is added are: Bakony-Szeg, Báta-Szék, Bor
Szék, Bükk-Szék, Eger-Szeg (<Ég Ur Széke), E-Szék (< Ó-Szék),
Fehér-Szék, Három-Szék, Kis-Szék, Kö-Szeg, Róna-Szék, Szi-Szek, and
Szék-Ács, Szek-Szárd, etc. With Kö: Barát-Ka, Szabad-Ka, Pát-Ka,
Dobo-Ka, Raj-Ka, Resz-Ke (< Réz-Kö), Pisz-Ke, Bél-Kö, Kö-Szeg.
Names with Pis: Danu-Bis, Ti-Bis, Cola-Pis (the medieval form of the
present Kulpa), Fischa (< Pis); and the dwelling names Pis-Ki, Pis-Kö,
Pis-Káros, Pisz-Ke, Pozsony (< Pis-Hon), Pös-Tyén. And finally place
names in Hungary with Mat: Doz-Mat, Dai-Mat, Ko-Mádi, Kecske-Mét,
Madi, Máta, Modor.

place-names of Oriental origin — over 2,000 names — from the

territory is not marked with squares on our map, because of its
oversized extension, but with dotted lines only.

The results of the above statistics have been illustrated on a map (Fig.

place-names, while the sparsely populated counties, with less than 30

This precious map, issued as a result of a minute inquiry, reveals that
the first permanent population of the Carpatho-Danubian basin was not
spread out evenly over the whole country. It concentrated upon two
major areas: 1. Transdanubia, with prolongations northwards into the
Vag valley and southwards into the Drava and Sava regions; and 2.
Transylvania with extensions into the valleys of the right-bank
tributaries of the Tisza. The two areas were separated from one another
by sparsely populated, marshy zones. Thus, as far as the degree of
civilization and geographic conditions allowed it, the land was already
filled to capacity in the Bronze Age (c. 1900 B.C.) by a permanent,
mostly agricultural population. The areas that were still available for
future migrants consisted of flooded and mountainous regions, excellent

3. The identity of the first settlers
The reader has no doubt noticed that most of the old place-names
which were handed down by the first population of the Carpatho
Danubian area had some definite meaning in Hungarian. This fact
suggests that they probably spoke Hungarian. This question shall now
be analysed in more detail.
The archaeological remains of the epoch allow us to distinguish the
presence of three closely related but different ethnic groups. The
largest one was made up of farmers, usually referred to as Magari
(Magyars) or Ari (Aryans). The second largest consisted of those
engaged in animal husbandry, and were called Siculi, Sikeloi
(Székely), while the third and smallest group were pastoralist people,
an occupation frequently connected with the Kush. The following



explanations support the threefold division, based upon the respective
economic activity.
1. That the Danubian farmers were Aryans and first practised their
trade all over Central Europe, was first noticed by L.A. Waddell, who
stated that "the Aryans were the forerunners of the agricultural stage
in the world's civilization" (P 132 p. 49). That these farmers were
MagAri, or Magyars, appears from the analysis of the Magyar name
itself, whose etymological meaning is, strictly speaking, 'farmer'. It
was used, and still continues to be in that sense, both in Hungary and
its neighbouring countries. In Hungarian, indeed, a 'farmstead' was
Major (pron. Moyor), and in the Austro-Bavarian German dialect, the
word for 'peasant' is similarly Mayer and Meyer. Farther west in
Germany, however, the common word for the same term is 'Bauer'.
In addition to the semantic connection of 'agriculturist' with the
Magyar name, there is much evidence suggesting that the bulk of the
Neolithic and Bronze Age inhabitants were really Magyars. Such
evidence includes the ethnic symbols, with which they identified
themselves in pictorial writing. The most widely used ones were: (1)
the bird (Madár), because it sounded like Magyar; (2) the lion, which
was Magaru (= Magyar) in Sumerian-Hungarian; and (3) a bee
(Méh), which combined with the wearer (Ur) formed the symbol
Mehar, which also sounded like Magyar. The role of the first two
symbols as Magyar ethnic identification badges was already discussed,
therefore there is no need to return to this subject. For the use of the
bee-symbol, however, we mention two instances: first, that the famous
neolithic obsidian factory was operating in Hungary at Méh-Telek, i.e.
on a 'Bee-Plot' and secondly that Herodotus records that in the
Carpatho-Danubian region there are great multitudes of 'bees', so that
it is impossible to visit that land (P 067 Book V cap. 10).
At this point we wish to introduce a unique statuette as well, found in



a site of the neolithic Tisza-culture (Fig. 23). It represents the harvest
divinity, holding a sickle in his right hand, an implement whose form
is the wellknown abbreviation in the Hungarian carved script for Isten
'God'. The statuette in question belongs to the category of the so
called 'talking statues', because its posture coveys a message (P 074 p.
21). We can read it by naming its conspicuous elements one after
another: the clenched hand (MArok), the arms in the plural KAR.ok,
the face AR, and the belt RA. These elements identify the God as being
Isten, MA-KAR.ok Ura 'God, Lord of the Magyars'. The ancient Egyptian
kings, who were also considered earthly deputies for God, were
frequently represented in exactly the same posture, as for instance
King Ramses II, whose image is shown above (Fig. 22). The strong
Egypto-Hungarian relations, which are apparent even here, do not
surprise us for all three major Magyar ethnic symbols originated there.
In ancient Egypt, the bird was the paramount divine symbol, the lion
usually accompanied the royal image, while the bee in the royal
cartouche was used to render the king's title as ruler of Lower Egypt.
This suffices to conclude that the bulk of the first sedentary population
of Old Hungary consisted of Hungarian-speaking, agricultural Magyars.
These early settlers transplanted Egyptian agricultural know-how,
tradition and mentality into the Middle Danube basin.
2. Hungary's next most numerous people of the Bronze Age, known by
name, were the Siculi or Sikeloi inhabitants, whose descendants are
called Székely (pron. Sakaly). They form a solid block of two and a
half million Magyar-tongued inhabitants in the heart of Transylvania,
the eastern province of historical Hungary. Their admirable folklore is
their most characteristic ethnic feature and is fully permeated with the
old solar cult. The visible image of their pre-Christian divinity, the
Sundisc, is usually displayed in their coat of arms, together with the
waxing Moon and the eight-pointed star. They are identical to those
seen on ancient Mesopotamian documents. The Siculi believed their



God was a human shaped giant, riding on a horse or in a brilliant
chariot in the sky. All the words used by the Siculi in connection with
the said idea-complex — Sun, Sky, Horse, Chariot, Way, Seat and so
on — belong to the oldest layer of the Hungarian vocabulary. The
etymological meaning of their name is also Hungarian, and
corresponds to their intimate religious life. Sikeloi is, indeed, a
compound with the following elements: S-IKE-LO-I, which would be
spelt today Az Égi Ló-i, meaning 'Follower of the Celestial Horse' or,
more plainly, 'Believer in Sungod'.
The Siculi or Sikeloi always played a significant part in Hungary's
history. Prior to their alliance with Prince Arpad, they were allies of
the Hun-Hungarians, in the Kingdom of Attila, according to our
national Annals (P 120 I p. 101). They also took part in the decisive
battle which brought about the downfall of the Hun Empire. Three
thousand Siculi cavalry-men managed somehow to escape from the
bloody battle and went into hiding in the unidentified Chigla-Field,
waiting for the return of "other" Hungarians (usque ad aliorum
Hungarorum reditum, P 120 I p. 279). As a matter of fact, when they
found out, at the end of the IXth century, that a new Magyar group
was on the way to Hungary under the leadership of Prince Arpad, the
Siculi horsemen, who had been living in the land for a long time,
galloped to the Carpathian passes to great their brethren. Then,
according to their agreement, they helped unify the land into a single
dominion. From that moment on, the fate of the Siculi merged with
that of the Arpad Hungarians.
During the reign of King Attila, the bulk of the Siculi-Hungarians still
dwelt in the western borders of the Carpathian land: in Upper
Hungary and in Transdanubia. They were the stockbreeders of the
epoch, belonging to a semi-military organization in charge of the
defence of the western boundaries of the Hun Empire. They were
directed by chiefs called Lófö, literally 'Great men', a title equivalent to



the medieval marquis. After the Hun-era, when the disintegrated
country was re-united by Prince Arpad and the Nation was converted
to the Christian faith, the eastern borders of the land became the most
sensitive ones. Therefore, the first Magyar kings transferred the Siculi
frontier-guards from Upper Hungary into Transylvania for further
duties. This displacement is evidenced by a series of medieval charters
and more recently by a toponymic study showing that 36 village
names of Transylvania are the exact duplicate of as many Upper
Hungarian place-names (Magyar Múlt, Sidney, 1977 no. 2). The
Transdanubian Siculi, who were not involved in the massive transfer,
remained in their original location in the West. Their long stay here
explains the surprisingly high number of solar place-names, especially
in Zala county, and also the existence of certain common dialectal
particularities between the Transylvanian and the Transdanubian
populations of today.
The fact that the Siculi's first places of habitation were in the western
parts of historical Hungary, suggests that they may have entered into
the land via the Adriatic Sea. The probability of this itinerary is
dramatically confirmed by the presence of other Siculi on the western
side of the Adriatic, namely on the Italian peninsula. This fact also
suggests a simultaneous arrival into both lands in question, around
the XIth century B.C. (cf. P 100 'Sicel'). That the Italian Siculi formed
the integral part of the great Siculi migration is further evidenced by
the fact that they too were led by chiefs called Syc-Lo-Pe and Laes-Turi
Gones, as reported by Thukydides in a distorted form (P 126 Book VI
cap. 18). These terms would be, in the more correct spelling, Sikel Ló
Fö (after the P > F soundshift in Lo-Pe),meaning 'Siculi Great Men';
and Lovas Túri Honös 'Mounted Trojan Ancestor' respectively.(41)
Another significant detail: one of the Siculi kings, Italus by name,
became the namegiver of the whole Peninsula, and also of the present
Italian nation.(42)



The Siculi in Italy were not numerous enough to keep the whole
peninsula for themselves. Actually, they were driven out therefrom
around 1035 B.C., when the majority of them crossed over to the
island of Sicily and forced the earlier inhabitants to retreat into its
western parts while they occupied all the rest of the land, changing its
name to 'Sicilia'. They lived in peace on the island about three
hundred years, until the Hellens began to drive them out. In the VIth
century B.C., the Sicilians were defeated in battle and their separate
national identity was gradually dissolved, — according to Thukydides.
Outside of Hungary and Italy, numerous Siculi tribes were also to be
found in the northwestern Punjab (India). They were locally known as
Sakai or Sakae (P 044 'Sakai'), the same as the Hungarian Székely.
These Hindu-Sikeli were also followers of the Sungod, calling him
Sacra (< Az Ég Ura) 'Lord of the Sky'. His female associate was Sacra
Ni (H.: Sacra Neje) 'Wife of the Heavenly Lord'. All the Hindu Sikeli
were engaged in animal husbandry. To sum up, the Siculi were a widely
diffused ancient race of the Ilnd and 1st millen-iums B.C. One of their
branches became, together with their Magyar brethren, the founders of
European Hungary, as seen from an ethnic standpoint.
3. Traces of a third people are also discernible in the Neolithic and
Bronze Ages in Hungary. They originated from the Kush or Cushan
folk, usually referred to in the scientific language as Mediterraneans
or Dinarians without, however, sufficiently emphasizing their
characteristic brownish complexion. The Kush race was first identified
in Eastern Africa, around the Great Lakes. It was also a widely
diffused old race, but broken up into a multitude of smaller or larger
ethnic entities that lacked any comprehensive political organisation
for a long time. They were the first great historical people to send out
colonists into southwest Asia and into Europe, including Hungary.
The European branch of the Kush seems to have spoken the



Hungarian language: whether through origin or by assimilation, is not
yet clear. At any rate, all their identifying symbols are Hungarian. The
most widely used such symbol was the ram: it accompanied them
through all their wanderings, in Egypt, Hungary, as well as in India
and Touran. Ram in Hungarian is Kos (pron. Kush), which was also
their national name. Their rulers, both terrestrial and divine, were
called Fö-Kos, 'The Principal Kush', and his distinctive symbol was a
kind of spontoon, called Fokos in Hungarian, a word that sounds like
their name. Kristóf Lukácsy, a distinguished Hungarian historian of the
XlXth century, was positively convinced that the language of the Kush
was Hungarian, even while they were still sojourning in the Oxus
region of Touran (P 092 p. 85).
The early presence of the Kush in Hungary is evidenced by a ram
headed altar found in a neolithic layer near Szeged. And the last
notable group of them lived in Upper Hungary, during the reign of
King St. Stephen (1000-1038). Their district was known as 'Dark
Hungary' (Ungaria Nigra), as opposed to 'White Hungary' (Ungaria
Alba), so called after the skin colour of the respective inhabitants.
With the conversion to Christendom, the cohesive force of the Kush
was broken and the people was absorbed into the majority. Their
memory still lingers in such place-names as Kosd (< Kush-Ta), Kosna
(< Kos Hona), Kustán (< Kus Tanya) and the family name of Kós.
To complete the presentation of the European Kush, we must also
mention that classical and medieval historical sources inform us that
both Britain and France have a considerable number of Kush absorbed
in their national body, who were locally called Picti (P 132 pp. 111
126 and P 065 p. 394). The Romans believed that they were so called,
because their faces were "painted", as the Latin word Pictus suggests.
This view is, however, unacceptable because the Kush were already
dark by birth and were called black well before the existence of the
Latin language. The key to the solution lies in the Hungarian



language, in which black is Fekete, whose old Hungarian form had
been Pekete, Pekte, prior to the P > F soudshift. Consequently the
oeiginal signification of the local name of the West European Kush
simply meant 'dark' and not 'painted.' Another local name of the dark
people in the British Isles was Cassi, from whom the Scots originated.
All the details listed above, when combined into a whole, are decisive
proof that the earliest inhabitants of the Carpatho-Danubian area were
Hungarians: variously known as agriculturist Magyars, stock-breeding
Siculi-Székely, and darkish coloured pastoral Kush. In other words the
present-day Hungarians seem to be direct descendants of the first
inhabitants of the land who lived there four thousand years ago.
4. The testimony of the Tatárlaki (Tartaria) tablets
1. The first inhabitants of the Carpatho-Danubian area have
bequeathed us with decisive historical evidence of their ethnic and
linguistic identity, in three inscribed clay tablets found at Tatárlaki
(now Tartaria), near the river Maros, in 1961 (Fig. 28). They turned
up in a mound barely measuring 240 m X 100 m. One of the tablets is
a roundel with a hole, while the two others are rectangular. The larger
rectangular one also has a hole, but the smaller one only bears the
picture of a horned goat. All three tablets appear to have been locally
made, while the accompanying objects come from the Mediterranean
and were either Cretan or Cycladic. The tablets aroused world-wide
interest, because they gave scholars a concrete chance of identifying
the language spoken by the earliest population of the Carpatho
Danubian basin.
Our inquiry about the tablets in question requires an answer to the
following three questions: (1) for which purpose were the tablets
made? (2) what message is written upon them? and (3) to which
historical period do they belong? Amongst the multitude of studies



already devoted to clearing up the mystery of these written
documents found on the soil of ancient Hungary, the most valuable is
that of Prof. M.S.F. Hood (USA) even though he failed to discover the
purpose of the tablets and denied that there was actual writing in the
signs carved upon the pieces.(43) Concerning the age of the tablets,
there were two opinions. The first emphasizes the Mesopotamian
character of the writing and, on that basis, suggests that the tablets
may have been made in the Uruk-period, somewhere around 3000
B.C. The second opinion, that of Prof. Hood, insists upon their Cretan
parallels and upon their Aegean and Anatolian connections in general.
Accordingly, the holder of this second view assigns a considerably
later period to the objects and suggests that they may have been made
between 2000 B.C. and 1700 B.C. Since then, no new judgements
have been formulated so that the mystery of the Tatárlaki tablets
continues to remain unsolved, more than twenty years after their
discovery.






Fig. 28. The world-famous Tatárlaki (Tartaria) clay tablets, found
near the river Maros. They were used for the purpose of solar
observations.
2. In our procedure of trying to find the secret of the Tatárlaki tablets,
we must first ascertain the purpose for which they were made. This
inquiry begins with the etymology of Tatárlaki, the name of the village
where they were discovered. It is a Hungarian compound, whose last
element (-Laka) means a detached, small cottage, literally 'the
dwelling of. But the first part of the name (Tatár) cannot be
interpreted as having been the dwelling of some Tartarian person,
because Tartars never lived in Hungary, particularly not in pre
Christian times. The full name in question is actually made up with
the following elements: Tat-Ár-Lak-a, the vocalized form of an original
deeper sounding Tót-Ur-Lak-a, with the literal meaning of 'God Thot's
Cottage'. That makes sense, because God Thot was an important
Egyptian divinity: patron of writing and reckoning, who was also in
charge of measuring time and doing solar observations for the
purpose of calendar making. In that perspective it seems logical to
conjecture, that the Tatárlaki tablets themselves may have been used
for solar observations and, ultimately, for setting up calendars.(44)



This conclusion is supported by other, circumstantial evidence.
To begin with, the plot where the find was made is a small one,
inadequate for farming. It was, however, large enough to make
astronomical observations, especially during the summer. Then, the
picture of a crab and a horned goat, engraved upon the tablets, is
further evidence supporting this idea. The same animals, indeed, are
part of the Zodiac, the crab being the symbol of the Cancer
constellation, and the horned goat that of the Capricorn. Moreover,
the circular hole appearing both on the roundel and upon the larger
rectangle must have been connected with celestial observations,
because this latter hole is surrounded by sunbeams to show,
unequivocally, that the rising Sun is meant thereby. Finally, the most
conspicuous details of the roundel supply us with the decisive word:
Calendar. In fact, the circular hole represents the Sun, in Hungarian
NAP, the giant cross intersecting the roundel carries the sound-value of
T, and the circular rim of the object supplies the final constituent AR.
These sounds, put together, give the word Nap-T-Ár, Naptár, which is
the Hungarian word for 'Calendar'. It seems thus certain that the
Tatárlaki tablets were components of a sophisticated solar observatory,
and were used for determining time.(45)
3. Before proceeding to our next task, i.e. deciphering the script
engraved upon the tablets, we must take a glimpse into the
astronomical thinking of Antiquity. At that time, the Sun was
considered a human-shaped divinity always on the move in the sky,
following a fixed yearly path, during which it bypasses 12 important
stations or groups of conspicuous stars called constellations. Several of
these groups appear before the eyes of observers, as shaping celestial
animals. Hence their names: Aries, Crab, Lion, Capricorn and so on.
All together, these animals form the 'Animal belt' or Zodiac. The
Zodiacal constellations were closely watched by ancient astronomers,
because they were suitable phenomena for measuring time. Certain



ones heralded the beginning of the seasons on a fixed day: Spring
(March 21), Summer (June 22), Autumn (September 23) and Winter
(December 22). In the northern hemisphere, the constellation that
could be observed most easily, was the one which signaled the
beginning of Summer. Daylight lasts longest on that day, when the
Sun ceases to ascend higher on the horizon, and begins its downward
course. This change of direction takes 11 days, during which the Sun
rises every morning at the same time and on the same point of the
horizon, as if it had stopped moving. So much suffices to understand
the sense of the message upon the roundel, to which we now return.
The sound-signs appearing on the round tablet are, in our opinion,
not Sumerian picture-signs, but more advanced carved signs. Most of
them correspond to Old Hungarian writing signs (see Fig. 14). The
only major difference the Tatárlaki tablets display vs. the Old
Hungarian letters lies in their outward appearance: the Tatárlaki
writing has a marked preference for linking signs together into bizarre
geometric shapes. The very close resemblance of the Tatárlaki signs to
the Old Hungarian ones invites us to try to read the mysterious
message in Hungarian, beginning with the roundel, according to our
Fig. 29, whereon the signs are separated into words.
Fig. 29. The sound-signs of the Tatárlaki tablets, separated into
words.



The first part of the message is placed in the upper half of the object
in question. It reads from left to right and the signs are transliterated
as follows: eZ. iR-áNY-O(n) J.öN eS.T.eN. 4. 05
Ó-Ra.K.oR. With present spelling: Ez irányon jön Isten 4.05 órakor, in
literal translation: 'God comes (= the Sun rises) in this direction at
4:05 o'clock.' The second part of the message, inscribed on the lover
half the roundel, reads in the reverse direction, from right to left, as is
indicated by the so-called turning letters, specially N, R and K. It runs
thus: ELE.RE aR.áK. S.iL.oK ég.ö-Ve.Be(n) 5 + 5 + eGY (= 11)
É.Ta.K-áN, in present spelling: Előre a rák csillag égövében 11 éjszakán
'Beforehand the Crab is twinkling in its celestial zone for 11 nights.'
Is our reading reliable? It is, when considering the following. First, the
decipherment produced a coherent and closely reasoned message, in
which all the written signs appear with their own sound-value. This
fact alone is usually considered as sufficient proof for the correct
reading. Secondly, the message uses a highly technical language,
according to the time and circumstances, which we can however
understand, since we already know the fundamentals of ancient
mentality. Besides, it follows the golden rule of the well written
ancient inscriptions, inasmuch as it uses seven words — not less, nor
more — in both sentences. Finally, all statements referred to in the
inscription are accurate, and all have been confirmed, since then, by
modern science. In fact, on the first day of Summer (June 22), the Sun
rises at Tatárlaki, on the 46th parallel, exactly at five minutes past four
o'clock.
Our next problem is to decipher the message inscribed upon the larger
rectangular tablet. It is divided into three compartments. We are, alas,
unable to make out the meaning of the signs placed into the first
compartment; but the remaining part is clear enough and says: 'Here
the Sun rises in the Cancer (constellation) on the day of...' (missing



sign?).(46)
The smaller rectangle has no carved script scratched upon its surface,
nor a hole to let the sunbeams penetrate into the observatory room.
On its surface is a horned goat with an eleven-branched tail, symbol of
the Capricorn constellation which announces the beginning of Winter.
Behind the goat, the outlines of a roaring animal are discernible,
probably that of the celestial dog, urging the Sun to ascend on its
brilliant way again. That the goat's picture holds for the Sun, is
evidenced by its having five legs, five being the sacred number of the
solar divinity. To make a hole on this tablet would have been useless,
because in winter the sky is usually overcast in Tatárlaki, and no
astronomical observations can be made.
4. The last question in connection with the Tatárlaki tablets deals with
the setting of the approximate date when the tablets could have been
in use for solar observations. Prof. Hood approached this question by
comparing the tablets with similar archaeological remains found at
Knossos in Crete and concluded that the Tatárlaki tablets cannot be
older than their Cretan variants, i.e. not older than c. 1900 B.C.
Therefore, he added, if the solar equipment in question has been
found in a neolithic layer, that could only have happened if the pit in
which it was found had been dug from a higher archaeological level.
Our own estimation, based upon the history of writing, supports the
opinion of Prof. Hood all the more, because certain dating terms, such
as "eleven times", appear on the similar Cretan tablets as well. Since,
however, the writing on the Tatárlaki tablets is more mature, a
younger age would be more suitable for them. This age can be
determined through a mathematical operation, by converting the
sidereal time given in the inscription, into our present time-computing
system, taking into consideration the phenomenon of precession. This
term designates the specific rotation of the Earth's axis which causes
the beginning of the various seasons not to always occur in the same



group of stars (constellation), nor on the same day. The vernal point
actually advances upon the ecliptic at a rate of one day in every 72
years. Therefore, after a shift of 30 days, i.e. 2160 years (= 30 X 72),
the sunrise will already occur in another constellation. The Tatárlaki
tablets report that the Sun's descending course happened on the
eleventh day of the Cancer constellation. On the other hand we also
know that the Cancer constellation lasted from c. 2220 B.C. to c. 60
B.C. (P 118 p. 78). Thus, its approximative age results from the
mathematical operation: B.C. 2220 minus 11 X 72, that is 1428 B.C.
As it disclosed, the Tatárlaki inscriptions constitute decisive historical
evidence, whereby it becomes clear that the first permanent population
of the Carpatho-Danubian basin spoke Hungarian and that their leaders
had highly sophisticated knowledge. That Hungarians were in evidence
in Central Europe considerably earlier than was theretofore believed, is a
fact which obliges us to substantially modify our historical conceptions
about the peoples of Europe in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages

THE SCYTHIAN HUNGARIANS
1. Their origin and civilization
The history of the Scythians is so complicated and forms such a
tangled skein of varied problems — says A. L. Mongait — that, in spite
of abundant sources for its study, "the Scythian problem remains an
intransigent subject, that is still far from settled" (P 097 bis p. 153). At
one time the Scythians are said to be Indo-Europeans, on the basis of
the similitude of their language; at another, they are considered Huns,
with whom they shared their cultural features. Elsewhere, it is
maintained that they belonged to the Hungarian-speaking group of
peoples (Uralo-Altaians), with whom they were closely linked
throughout their history, both in the Orient and the Occident. All these
opinions circulate freely, since nobody has, as yet, correctly analysed
the Scythian tongue, nor deciphered any of their written messages.
What is definitely known about the Scythians, however, is that they
did not all live in a single political structure, but were broken up into
several political entities, with as many individual ethnic
denominations. The lack of political unity of the Scythians could not,
however, conceal their close affinities: they all spoke the same
language, had the same solar cult, the same civilization and "were linked
by some sort of racial tie" (P 123 p. 42).
Their original homeland, or more precisely, the geographic area where
history first detected them, was the northern hinterland of
Mesopotamia and Syria. From these regions they were gradually
squeezed out by the continuous razzias of the Assyrians, a Semitic
population swarming out from the nearby deserts. They subjected the
whole Scythian Old Fatherland to their iron rule during the VIIIth
century B.C. The destruction of the Kingdom of Arpad, on the great



bend of the Euphrates, in 743 B.C. and the capture of the City7State
of Karkemish in 717 B.C. were the final stage of Semitic expansion to
the North. The Sythian tribes, driven out of their old homes, first
concentrated along the Araxes and Kura rivers, in the swampy region
of thousands of islands. Thereafter they gradually occupied the
higher-lying Terek and Kuban regions, and finally took possession of
the large tract of land above the Caucasus, up to the elbow of the
Volga.
When they were at the zenith of their history, in the first millenium
B.C., Scythian kings ruled over the immense natural grassland
stretching from the Carpathians and the Lower Danube eastward,
above the Black sea, to the Caucasian mountains (European Scythia)
and the Caspian sea, including the Touranian Plain and the Oxus
valley (Asiatic Scythia). In addition, detachments of Scythians
occupied other farflung regions, such as northwest India and the
eastern Asian section of the steppe, extending up to the Chinese
borders.
Ruling over such an extensive territory was only possible thanks to the
large scale use of the riding horse, which allowed rapid communication
between widely separated areas. This innovation explains why the
Scythians became the first political organizers in the history of the
entire Eurasian steppe. Prior to the use of riding horses, greater
political units could be established in large river valleys only, where
boats fulfilled the same role, as in the Nile valley and also in the
Euphrates and Indus valleys.
It was between 750 B.C. and 500 B.C. that the individuality of the
Scythians emerged. They had then a mixed economy: some
agriculture, large scale stock-raising, (in which horse-breeding was
predominant) and also mining and metal working. They lived under
kings and princes whose principal identifying emblem was the golden



stag medal. They always moved around on horseback and wore close
fitting pantalons. Their most important arm was a longrange bow,
having arrows fitted with triangular metal heads. Under the impact of
the new equestrial armies, the Scythians evolved a peculiar defense
system, consisting of earthworks. Its purpose was to render any sudden
mounted attack against human settlements impossible. The system
included a fortified rampart or dike with a deep and wide ditch, filled
with water on its outside. The rampart was then planted with thorny
hedges, shrubs and trees. These fences extended for hundreds of miles
and surrounded thousands of acres of soil as well, to keep the
livestock protected against predators. This Scythian military strategy
set the pattern for the entire steppe-population and was to remain
unchanged for centuries to come.
2. Scythians in Hungary
Owing to the growing pressure of the Sarmatians, another mounted
steppe people, the European Scythians slowly drifted westward. They
percolated through the Carpathians, and gradually brought the Great
Hungarian Lowland, the westernmost fringe of the great Eurasian
natural grassland, under their control. They soon transported hereto
their royal seat and thus Hungary became the center of Scythian rule.
The first Scythian group reached Hungary around 550 B.C. They were
called Agathyrsi and have established campsites in the Upper Maros
region. They were followed by other groups, occupying many places
on the Great Plain, the Transylvanian plateau and in the Bükk and
Mátra area. The Scythians were the first Danubian people to establish
effective rule over the entire population of Hungary. Thus, the
Carpatho-Danubian basin was first unified politically by them. During
their rule in Hungary (c. 500 B.C. - 350 B.C.), the Scythians came into
contact with the aboriginal Magyar population on a large scale,
through intermarriage. Following this historical process, all the
Magyar speaking population of the Danube basin began to call



themselves "Scythians", an appellation that strongly influenced the
view of the medieval chroniclers, who considered the Magyars as a
Gens Scythica. The long stay in Hungary of the Scythian ruling clan is
evidenced by the most beautiful Scythian treasure ever found,
consisting of two gold stags, discovered at Tápió-Szent-Márton and at
Zöld-Halom-Puszta respectively (Fig. 30-31).
Fig. 31. Scythian gold-stag from Zöld-Halom-Puszta in an unusual
posture. Hungary, Vth century B.C.
The last major detachment of Scythians entered the land under the
general name of Sarmati (Sarmatians). They are, however, most
frequently mentioned by their clan-names, as Alani, Yazigues and
Roxolani. The Yazigues settled in Hungary in A.D. 20, and occupied
the pasture-land between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, where they
erected strong fortifications. Thanks to their inaccessible territory, they
could preserve their autonomous rule during the Roman occupation of
Pannónia and Dacia. They lost their ethnic identity during the Hun
period, but a large district and a county still retain their name.
The presence of Scythians in Hungary is superbly documented by the
archaeological remains of their civilization: grave-mounds and colossal
defence installations. The grave-mounds or barrows resulted from the



earth they heaped up upon the tombs of their defunct leaders, kings
or princes. Grave-mound in Hungarian is Sir-Halom or simply Halom.
This term forms part of several dozens of old place-names all over the
country, such as Herceg-Halom, 'Prince's Mound'; Zöld-Halom-Puszta
'Green Mound on the Steppe' (there are four such names), in one of
them a precious gold stag-medal was found, proving that the mound
is really a princely one; Sas-Halom 'Eagle's Mound'; Hegyes-Halom
'Pointed Mound' (two such names); Száz-Halom 'Hundred Mounds'
(where the victims of a huge battle have been buried in the Hunnic
times). Until 1939, 85 Scythian burial sites were excavated in
Hungary, a testimony of the numerous Scythians who were living
there.
The innumerable remains of the former Scythian defense system
allowed the archaeologists to reconstruct its whole extension. The
main line, often in triple rows, started at the Danube elbow at Vác and
proceeded eastwards along the northern edge of the Great Plain
through Eger and Tokaj to Nyíregyháza. At that point it turned
southwards, by-passed Szatmár, Nagyvárad, Gyula and Versec, and at
that level, it reached the Danube again. At certain strategically
important points, such as at Sopron on the west, and the region of
Diósgyőr in the northeast, more elaborate embankments were
constructed. Secondary or disconnected ditches existed near rivers at
crossings and fords (Garam, Vág, Maros, Temes, Olt), and in mountain
passes as well. The rectangular rich land between the Danube and the
Tisza to the south was protected by triple lines on its open northern
side. The total length of the embankments and ditches in Hungary
exceeded 1700 km, while the enclosed and protected area measured
62,000 km2. The building of these defence lines required the removal
of 20,000,000 m3 of earth (P 084 and P 102). The technical terms for
the various parts of the defence installations were the following: the
general name of earthen stronghold was Föld-Vár, the ditch was Árok',



the rampart or embankment was Gát; the fence or hedge on top of the
embankment Sövény, the enclosure or area surrounded with
entrenchment was Sánc or Udvar. These technical terms occur by the
dozens in Old Hungarian place-names; one has only to open the
Directory of Hungary's place-names to be convinced about this. We
have such names as Duna-Földvár, Árok Szállás, Gát-Falva, Sövény
Háza, Sánc, Sánci-Puszta, Sánc-Pataka, Udvar-Hely, etc.
When was this system built and who were its builders? It is obvious
that the whole system was not erected at one time. Certain sections
were, in all probability, completed during the last centuries of the first
millenium B.C., toward the end of Scythian domination, when their
rule was threatened. Other parts were built by the Sarmatians, the
successors of the Scythians proper, between 250 and 300 A.D.
Furthermore, the work was continued during the Hun period as well.
Sometimes the ditches' names may give a clue to this question, which
are in English: 'Ditch of the Giants', 'Ditch of the Devil', 'Ditch of the
Dark Men' (i.e. Csörsz Árka, Csörsz meaning 'Dark' in the local
parlance). Other names point to a younger period, such as 'Ditch of
the Huns', 'Road of Attila', 'Ditch of the Avars' and 'Roman
Embankments'.
To erect so many mounds, and build such gigantic earthen
strongholds, it was necessary to have a strong central authority,
unified planning, constant maintenance work and, above all, a great
number of people for manual work. It follows that not a "few"
Scythians had come to live in Hungary, as was earlier erroneously
supposed, but "many": ordinary people, as well as kings and princes.
3. The language of the European Scythians
Ancient authors, such as Herodotus, Strabo, Plinius, Jordanes and
others agree that all Scythian people spoke the same language, and



modern scythologists have also accepted this view almost
unanimously. The controversy begins with the next question, viz. what
was this language and with which language group was it affiliated? In
trying to solve this mystery, we will examine, in turn, common
Scythian words recorded by foreign authors, then Scythian ethnic and
personal names, and finally Scythian symbols and other written
evidence.
One of our principal sources is, of course, Herodotus who had such a
keen interest in the Scythian way of life that he undertook the
tiresome journey to Olbia on the Black Sea shore to find out more
about it. He noted that every Scythian carried an inward curving
sharp knife strapped to his boot, and called "A Cina Kesh". In present
graphic form, this expression would be A csizma kés (The Boot Knife),
whose most important element Kesh, 'Knife' is Kés in Hungarian as
well. Herodotus also relates that one of the Scythian names for
Sungod was Oetos-Ur-Us, which is also a Hungarian name
Ötös Ur-Ös 'Number 5 Divinity', five being the sacred number of the
Sungod, as already mentioned. The Master also noticed that Upper
Scythia is often snow-covered in winter, for which reason the soil is
concealed from view for months. And he adds that the Scythians call
the snow-flakes 'feathers'. Similarly, in Hungarian the same word Pihe
is used for both the fine feathers and the light snow-flakes.
The father of historiography was charmed with all that he had learned
about the principal Scythian river, the Dnieper, then called Danaber,
something like Tanya Bor 'River of the Field' in Hungarian. It was also
called Bor Ysthenes, which is again a Hungarian name, meaning
'Divine Water' or 'Fine Water'. Then Herodotus lists a series of
arguments why the river is so fine. This river "has upon its banks the
loveliest and most excellent pastures for catties; it abounds in the
most delicious fish; its water is most pleasant to the taste; its stream is



limpid." All these added expressions bolster the Hungarian etymology
of the word Ysthenes. And the other part of the river's name, 'Bor',
signifies in the local Sekeli-Hungarian dialect of Transylvania,
'drinking water', most often of thermal origin.
Turning now to the Scythian ethnic and personal names, we again refer
to Herodotus who says that the name by which the Scythians above
the Black Sea called themselves, was Scoloti, whereas the Assyrians
called them Ishkusai or Ashguzai and the Greeks simply Skytoi. When
these names are placed back into their original spelling, according to
the phonetical evolution of the Hungarian, they prove to have been
taken from the Hungarian vocabulary. All the names in question
terminate with the adjectival suffix -i, which gives the name the
meaning of 'originating from', 'coming from' or 'native of'. It follows
that the preceding word must indicate the specific geographic area
where the Scythians formerly lived. In the case of Scoloti (< H.: Ös
Kelet-i) this original homeland is 'Ancient Orient' (the same as Chaldi,
Khaldi), by which name Babylon was also called. The meaning of Ish
Kuza-i and Ash-Guza-i presents no difficulty, when remembering the
easy interchangeabi-lity of the kindred consonants K, G and H. It
means in Hungarian Ös-haza-i 'Originating from the Old Fatherland',
—again Mesopotamia, the same geographic area. At first sight, less
evident is the etymology of Skytoi, which may be the Grecized form of
the original Hungarian Szigeti 'Coming from the Isles', a reference to
their sojourn in the thousand islands of the rivers Kur and Araxes in
the southern Caucasus.
All the names analyzed were first given to the Scythians while they
were still living in the Caucasian region, busy reconstructing their
political set-up with various 'blood-contracts'. They retained these
names even later, when another of their group settled in a similar
region, around the other side of the Caspian Sea (in Touran). Because
of the multitude of isles in that area as well, Ptolemy called it Insulae



nationum, 'Isles of Nations'. From the third century B.C. onward, when
the Scythians had already lived for generations in their acquired
'Scythia', they were no longer considered as newcomers, but as
'natives' in their own country. Accordingly, they began to be called
Hon-i, or in ancient Hungarian spelling: Huni 'Natives', 'Country-Men',
again in plain Hungarian. The first Scythian detachments posted on
Hungarian soil were the Agathyrsi, in the Upper Maros valley,
Transylvania. They were assigned to frontier-guard duties, as their
name clearly implies: A Gath Yrsi < A Gát Őrző 'Guardians of
Embankments'. The last Scythian confederation of tribes to settle in
Hungary were the Yazigues: they settled between the Danube and the
Tisza rivers, in the southern central part of Hungary in A.D. 20. By
trade, they were cattle keepers and shepherds, as is proven by their
name: Yazigue < Jószág (őr) being 'Cattle (keepers).
The list of Scythian ethnic denominations can be completed by a few
royal names with a clear meaning. These are mainly the ones which
include the distinguishing word 'Aryan', Ur, Ar in Hungarian, as Aria
Peita <Arja Fajta 'King who is of Aryan origin'; Ari-Antus <Arja Honős
'Aryan Land Ancestor'; Scyl-Urus < Urös 'Székely Ancestor'. All the
foregoing details are sufficient to convince the reader that the
Scythians were misjudged until now as far as their ethnic and linguistic
identity is concerned. It seems absolutely certain to-day that they were
Magyar tongued and belonged to the once widely diffused Hungarian
race.
The written documents the Scythians left behind them bring fresh and
decisive evidence to the above conclusion. Amongst such documents,
the oldest one is written by the pictorial method which conveys
abstract ideas by images of similar-sound-ing concrete objects, as has
been indicated several times. In Scythian practice, and also elsewhere,
the pictorial writing was mainly used to express royal titles, such as
Ancestor, Divine Ancestor. For the former title, the image of an eagle



was used, whereas for the latter, that of a stag. The names of these
animals in Hungarian, Sas and Szarvas, sounded, indeed, like Az ős
and Az Urős respectively. This method of identifying rulers by that way
was very widespread, especially in the first millenium B.C., so that a
golden stag found in a Scythian mound was considered by
archaeologists as the supreme evidence of being connected with a
royal tomb.
Because of inherent difficulties, pictorial writing was rarely used for
communication of messages of any length; we know of only two such
examples, both recorded by Herodotus. The first message narrates
how the newly acquired Scythian Kingdom was inherited by Colaxis,
the youngest of the three sons of Targitaus, the conqueror (P 067
Book VII cap. 64). God had strewn upon the earth, from the sky, four
golden implements: a plough, a yoke, a battle axe (sagaris) and a
drinking cup. The Kingdom should be inherited by the one of the
three brothers who could pick them up. The two elder brothers failed
to do so because the gold took fire as they approached it. But when
the youngest born neared the treasure, the flames suddenly vanished,
and he picked up the gold. What was the divine message written with
these golden objects? We can find out by writing down, one after
another, the names of the four items in the Hungarian language:
EKE.IGA. SAGARIS.KUPA, which gives the following similar sounding
sentence: E7KEIG/AS/AGARIS/ KEPE: E kölyök az Égurös képe 'This
child is the deputy for the Heavenly Lord'. That meant, in
contemporary language, the Colaxis (the Child) must assume the title
'God on Earth', i.e. the royal dignity. The children had understood the
message and they agreed to bequeath the kingdom to the youngest
born —says Herodotus.
The second known pictorial message of the Scythians, also in the
Hungarian language, was sent to King Darius in 512 B.C., when the
latter invaded Scythia to avenge the destruction of Assyria, a hundred



years earlier. As the Persian armies bogged down, following the
scorched earth policy of the Scythians, Darius, to save face, declared
that he would be satisfied with a symbolic submission by receiving the
usual water and earth gift from the Scythian king. But, instead of the
required gift, the Scythian king sent Darius a bird, a mouse, a frog and
five arrows. The Persian king thereupon consulted his chief advisors to
find out the meaning of the message. There was, indeed, no doubt
that this was a written document. The advisors were divided in their
interpretation: some deciphered it as a peace-offer, the Scythian king
would be willing to make to the Persians. Others thought that the
message contains a serious threat, viz. that all the Persians will be
killed with arrows. Darius agreed with the second reading and, panic
stricken, left Scythia on one of the following nights. To find out the
meaning of the strange message, we again write down the
corresponding Hungarian words: MADÁR. EGÉR.BÉKA. ÖT. NYIL and
we find the similar sounding, sentence: Magyari kér békét őnála,
'Magyar asks for peace with him', exactly as the first group of advisors
had deciphered the message. A second interpretation is possible, when
the word for mouse (egér) is replaced by another one for the same
animal, Sir, used by the kindred Komi (P 060 p. 19). In that case the
message reads thus: Magyar sírba küld nyíllal 'Magyar will kill thee
with arrows'. And that was the way Darius himself interpreted the
intention of the Scythians.
Besides the pictorial writing, the Scythians were also acquainted with
the carved script and bequeathed us a unique message written in that
way. It is engraved upon a silver dish 14 inches wide found near the
town of Sakiz to the south of Lake
Urmia. It is decorated with animal figures in a row between two
concentric circles. Its featured decor was a golden horse, set in the
centre. The treasure was meant for a wedding present offered by a
Scythian prince on the occasion of the marriage of King Bartatua or



King Madyes, to an Assyrian princess in the second half of the VIIth
century B.C. (P 054 p. 106; P 123 p. 22 f.). The script (reproduced in
P 054 p. 109 and explained in P 007 II p. 63 f.) reads thus in
Hungarian: E kis tálcát valaki bőkezűen neki adja; as éke ló 'This small
tray is generously given to him by somebody; its adornment is a
horse'. After that follows the value of the ware, in conformity to
ancient uses and customs. Now, the expression 'its adorment is a
horse' conceals the identity of the donor as Sekeli, 'a Siculi'.
Finally, we must mention that the Scythians probably had studied and
used Greek letters as well, proof of which are two coins of the Indian
Saka-dynasty (first century B.C.). On one of the coins the following
Magyar words appear: TURANNO UNTOS 'ERAOY and on the other
side: SAKA KOGGANOI. On the second coin: YRKODOY MAKAROY,
and on the back: SK'WR (i.e. SAKA UR), (transliteration in P 059 p.
133). According to the present Hungarian orthography, the
inscriptions would read thus: 1. Turáni Honös, Király — Székely kagán
'Touranian land -ancestor, — Siculi kaghan' and 2. Uralkodója Magyar
— Székely úr' 'Its ruler is a Magyar, a Siculi Prince'.
The three kinds of writing illustrated — pictorial, carved and
alphabetical — definitely prove our previous statement: that the
Scythians were a Hungarian-speaking people, literate and skillful in
writing.
4. Who were the Kelti or Celts?
History books tell us, that around 300 B.C. the name 'Scythian'
abruptly vanished from circulation, and that per contra, the Kelti
name made its appearance at about the same time. Is there any
connection between the two phenomena? Nobody knows with any
certainty, in spite of ample available material for the study of Celtic
problems. In Hungary alone, for example, over 590 Celtic sites were



discovered until 1976, — says Miklós Szabó, author of a book on the
Celts in Hungary (P 119 pp. 36 and 16). The basic two volume
publication of Henri Hubert (P 070) gives a great deal of factual
information about the general history of the Celts, but is already
somewhat antiquated. Two smaller recent works, the comprehensive
study of Venceslav Kruta (P 083) and Jan Filip (P 049) respectively
are far from able to fill the gap. None of the authors mentioned took
full advantage of the invaluable help toponymy offers to scrutinize the
Celtic place-, ethnic and personal names, although such names are
copiously recorded even in J. Caesar's De bello Gallico. Furthermore,
Celtic inscriptions engraved upon coins and other archaeological finds
were also not taken into due consideration. We even ignore the
meaning of the very name: Kelti.
As regards the ethnic identity of the Celts, it was thought, two
generations ago, that they were an individual, original human species,
i.e. men of high stature and fair complexion. To-day our scholars are
inclined to see in these 'first Europeans' rather small-statured, lightly
brownish complexioned 'Mediterraneans'. Again others are of the
opinion that the Celti were only a ruling class over the previously
immigrated, predominantly pre-Indo-European population. Still others
think that the Celts were Indo-Europeans who strongly mixed with the
aborigines. We do not lack hypotheses, but the truth is, as V. Kruta
puts it: "For the time being, there exists no indisputable evidence for the
ethnic appurtenance of those who have been called the 'Princes of the
first Iron Age" (P 083 p. 64).
In the present state of our researches, we must make use of
circumstantial evidences to learn more about the ethnic identity of the
Celts. A closer look at the manifestations of Celtic civilization,
convinces us that they contained no new feature; all their most
striking characteristics having already been evident in the previous,
Scythian civilization. These included the fortified place protected by



embankments, ditches and hedges, the multitude of animal images
which pervaded their arts, the use of horses and sunworship, a
heritage from the New Stone Age. There was only one new addition to
Celtic culture: the extensive use of iron. It follows that the 'Celts' must
have been an amalgam of the previous non-Indo-European inhabitants
of Europe. This is exactly what scholars have discovered during the
course of their comparative studies. It was found, indeed, that the Picti
of northern Scotland were already Celts — "early Celts" — who called
themselves by that word in the form of Khaldes or Chaltis, which is
the Kelti in ancient graphic form (P 132 p. 139). J. Hawkes also places
the makers of the bell-shaped vessels into the category of the Celts.
There too, the peoples of the barrow-graves can be found (i.e. the
Scythians, P 049 pp. 16 and 20), and also the Turoni, who migrated
from Central Europe to the banks of the Loire (P 089 p. 11), as well as
the Secani, who went from Hungary to France, etc. There were also
peoples called Kelto-Scythians, Kelto-Ligurians, Kelt-Iberi. Thus, it is
evident, that the Celts were not a new race in Europe, and the Celt or
Kelti name was used as a comprehensive designation of the entire pre
Christian population of Europe.(47)
The huge and kindred Celtic mass of B.C. Europe was linked together
by a common language as well, in addition to the above-mentioned
identical elements of their civilization. According to the estimate of
Camille Julien (Paris) "a hundred million" Europeans spoke the Kelti
language in the second half of the first millenium B.C. Consequently,
there was no linguistic barrier in ancient Europe.(48) In spite of these
categorical statements, nobody has, alas, identified the Celtic
language, nor proved its affiliation with any other. In that respect we
are still completely in the dark. The reason? Nobody has yet
approached the Celtic problem with the Hungarian key. In the
following, we shall try to analyze the etymological meaning of the
fundamental word: Kelti.



Before us, Henri Hubert, the most eminent French specialist of the
Celts has made great efforts to find out the meaning of the Celti name.
He carefully noted all the various graphic forms in which this name
occurred and concluded (1) that it reached its widest diffusion during
the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and (2) that it contains the rootword
Kel (Quel in French graphic form), "implying the idea to rise" (P 070 I
p. 27). He mentions this meaning as the most probable one, amongst
many other conjectures listed in a footnote. He could, however, not go
any farther in his explanations, thus the question remained unsolved.
(49)
In Hungarian the word Kel signifies 'to rise' and Kelet the cardinal
point where the Sun rises, i.e. 'Orient, East'. And the same word, when
the -i suffix is added as Kelt-i, Kelet-i means 'He who has come from
the direction of the rising Sun', i.e. from the Orient. In ancient times,
this word was spelt in various ways, such as Chaldi, Chaldean and
Scoloti. Like most ancient Hungarian ethnic names, it indicates no
ethnic particularity, but is merely a geographic appellation recalling
their previous fatherland. As such, it was a fitting comprehensive
name, because all the pre-Indo-European ethnic groups originated
from the same region: from the ancient Orient. Thus, the name Kelti or
Keleti was the general term designating all the Hungarian speaking
ethnic groups which had migrated to Central and Western Europe from
the ancient Orient since the New Stone Age.
The Kelti were a very cultured human mass, to whom Europe owes a
great deal. They were the one who christened all the great rivers and
mountains of that continent, who designated the places of the future
great cities, and planned the first network of communication. They
were the 'first Europeans'. Had History given them another hundred
years, they would have formed a great unitary nation, centered
around Gallia and Hungary. But this century had not been granted to
them. As is known, the Romans, "who have become the enemy of the



race which founded it", literally destroyed this nation during its
gestation. The holocust of the Celts in Gallia was perpetrated by Julius
Caesar and his legions, in the first century B.C., between 59 and 51.
They systematically massacred all the political leaders of that nation,
their soldiers and priests, killing altogether three millions and setting
fire to eight hundred towns and villages. After that, the people were
economically ruined, terrorized, assimilated and Romanized. The
history of Europe does not know of any other similar killings. Yet, Caesar
had been whitewashed by historians of all his crimes and stands before
us as a "Great European". Only the Kelti in Hungary were capable to
outlive the century of hell in Europe.

THE HUN HUNGARIANS
1. The Roman and Germanic influence upon the ethnographic
conditions in the Carpatho-Danubian basin
1. The peaceful penetration of Magyar-speaking Oriental tribes into
the Carpatho-Danubian region was interrupted after the Scythian and
Celtic periods and was replaced by armed interventions from the
West. First came the Romans, an imperialist people. After having
created a solid basis on the Apennine peninsula, they gradually
extended their domination over the entire Mediterranean area during
the second and first centuries B.C. Thereafter, for growing security
and economic reasons, they extended the frontiers of their Empire up
to the Danube, which meant, for Hungary, the occupation of her
western province, Transdanubia. After a difficult and long war (from
12 B.C. to 9 A.D.) they besieged it and about fifty years later
converted the conquered land into a Roman province, under the name
of Pannónia. They ruled this province for about four hundred years,



and then gradually handed it over to the Huns, between 409 and 433.
What interests us, regarding the Roman rule of Pannónia, is to
ascertain what had happened to the large Magyar-speaking population
there. In that respect, we must first recall that the Roman conquest
was prompted by strategic considerations and its military character
was predominant up to the very end. Above all, the Romans wanted to
build a strong military barrier along the Danube. Secondly, the
province's Roman governors were not as blood-thirsty and ruthless as
was Julius Caesar in Gaul. Thanks to these circumstances, the Roman
conquest was neither followed by wholesale massacres of the
inhabitants, nor by the extermination of the upper classes, nor by the
colonization of the land by a Latin-speaking population. The former
tribal structure of the society was maintained, including local
administration (P 087 pp. 112, 117). The legions which were keeping
watch on the Danube, and the various auxiliary personnel employed
for guarding the military roads were mostly manned by a local
population, including their commanders. Moreover, what was no less
important: the Romans did not suppress the native beliefs. Thus, once
the war was over, life, on the whole, followed its ancestral course.
Taking all that into account, our scholars evaluated the effect of Roman
rule in Pannónia, from an ethnographic point of view, as harmless.
Those who studied Hungarian life in Pannónia under Roman rule
more closely, have pointed out certain linguistic facts which evidence
the survival of the Hungarian language. The very name of the land
Pannónia, for example, is a Hungarian compound with Pan and Hon
(=H.: Fenn-Hon) meaning 'Upper Land'. The most important city was
Savaria, so named after the Sungod (cf. Savi-tra, Savarna, P 044). In
that city, God was worshipped in a great temple, which had an
immense Sundisc above its altar. The present-day village of Szabar,
near ancient Savaria, probably retains the ancient city's names.



For the survival of the Hungarian language under the Roman rule, it is
highly significant that the Roman emperors, coming from Pannónia,
used Hungarian throne-names, as did Had-Ri-Anus (117-138), Aur-Eli
Anus (270-275), Val-Eri-Anus (253-260), and Sev-Erus (193-211). In
these names the Hungarian component -Anus (= Honős) often
appears, meaning 'Country Ancestor', or the word -Erus (Urős) 'Divine
Ancestor'. It is not surprising to find so many Hungarian traces in
Pannónia, since the political and military centre of the Roman Empire
was, in the third and fourth centuries A.D., no longer in Rome, but in
Pannónia and Illyria instead. During this time, these provinces, or
rather their inhabitants, supplied the best soldiers, governors, and
emperors, and also 'Roman' virtue.
After the conquest of Pannónia, the Romans conquered the eastern
part of Hungary as well and emperor Trajan converted it to another
Roman province named Dacia. The emperor personally conducted the
military operations (101-105). The occupation of this land was
actually prompted by economic reasons: the Romans wanted to lay
their hands upon the abundant supply of gold, silver, copper and salt
which was mined there. Dacia's occupation was, however, short lived,
lasting about a century and a half. Indeed, the province had to be
abandoned in 271, when Roman personnel was evacuated and
withdrawn to the southern shore of the Danube. The three most
important Dacian cities, Sar-Mizegeth-Usa, Napo-Ca, and A-Pu-Lum
have clear Hungarian meanings. The first name would be in present
spelling Sár-Mezőket-Ásó (city) 'Where gold fields are dug', the second
Nap-Kő 'Sun City', and the third A Fő Ló (városa) '(City) of the
Principal Horse', also a Sun city.
The Roman never subjected the mountainous northern section of
Hungary, nor the great Central Plain, between Pannónia and Dacia, to
their rule. The tribes living in that part of the land maintained their
independence. So, Roman domination passed without vital harm in



Dacia as well. But, by dismembering the Carpatho-Danubian land into
three parts, they retarded the unification of the diverse social groups into
a single nation, a process which had been going on since Scythian times.
Thus it happened that the territorial re-unification of the entire
Carpathia area and the building of a nation befall the next generation of
great leaders: King Attila and Prince Arpad.
2. Shortly after the Roman Empire's entry into the Carpathian basin,
Germanic tribes also began their penetration into the land. They started
from their northwestern homeland Scandia (Scandinavia) pushing
eastwards on the East-European table-land until they had reached the
River Don in the third century A.D. They were called Goths, and
formed two separate groups, the Ostro-Goths and the Visi-Goths. A
third Germanic tribal federation, the Gepids, was formed inside the
Carpathians, in Transylvania, above the Maros river, as far as the
Tisza.
The appearance of Germanic tribes in Eastern and Central Europe
filled the Romans with fear, so they encouraged the Huns, who were
also threatened, into action. The tense situation provoked the armed
intervention of the Huns in 375. After this, Germanic rule crumbled
away and the Huns gained control over all eastern and central
Europe. This is all well known in history, so that we do not need to
discuss it. But less known is the ethnic build-up of the Germanic tribes
in question. It is, indeed, a false assumption that the Germanic tribes
were as fully Germanic in Eastern and Central Europe as they were
when invading continental Europe from Scandinavia around Christ's
birth. The explanation is obvious: when the Germanic tribes started
for the distant adventure, they usually travelled without women folk
and therefore strongly mixed with local population during their
wanderings. That had the effect, that within three or four generations,
they were a completely different people from the one that set out. The
following short analysis will show how the Germanic tribes mixed



with Hungarians when they reached the domain of the Magyar ethnic
body.
The name Gepida was given to the confederation of Germanic tribes
which occupied northeastern Hungary. It has no accepted etymology
in the Germanic language, but has in Hungarian, where Gyep-i Ta
means '(Men) of the Grass-Land', where the Gepids actually lived. And
in the case of the Visi-Goths, which name is supposed to signify 'West
Goths' in the Germanic language, the Hungarian gives again a more
plausible explanation. In it Visi (in to-day's Hungarian Vizi) means
'Those who live near water courses', which was again true of the
Goths. The Germanic ethnic identification symbols were also taken
over from the local population, particularly the eagle, typical symbol
of the steppe population, and also birds in general. We should also not
forget that Gothic script, the so-called Runen, was a simplified Magyar
carved script. Its German name originated from the Hungarian word
róni 'to carve'. Thus, we should agree with the statement of Gyula
László, according to which "the scant upper class of the Goths, the
conquering layer, underwent an almost complete transformation
under the impact of local traditions and customs" (P 087 pp. 161
164). The modified social structure of the Goths and Gepids was one
of the main reasons why they accepted to stay in the Carpathian land
so readily even after the Hun conquest, faithfully serving their new
king Attila. All that considerably modifies the image we had of the
migration of the Germanic peoples, at least in the sector of
southeastern Europe. It altogether confirms that the aboriginal
Hungarians could keep their own ethnic identity unchanged. And that
was the most important feature of the Middle Danube basin on the eve of
the coming of the Huns.
2. The coming of the Huns
The Huns emerged in history as an Oriental people living on the



pastures of the Oxus river valley, to the south of the Aral Sea.
However, in the second century A.D., most of them had already
skirted the southern end of the Caspian Sea and were in possession of
the land above the Caucasus mountains up to the mouth of the Don
river, the steppeland of former Scythia. Their westward move was
prompted by fatal climatic changes which transformed their cradle
land (Touran) into a semi-desert. Increasing temperatures resulted in
a considerable reduction of the water supply and the grass of the
fields vanished. Thus the Huns, living from animal husbandry, had to
move and look for new grazing land. At the same time, as just
mentioned, Germanic tribes were advancing eastwards on the great
European Plain, by occupying more and more pasture, until they too
had reached the river Don and came in direct contact with the Huns.
Alarmed by their double misfortune, the Huns felt that their very
existence was being threatened and that provoked their violent
reaction. Under their first great king Balamber, they attacked the
Ostro-Goths, their nearest adversaries, and swiftly broke their power.
The Ostrogothic ruling class took refuge in Pannónia and proceeded to
Italy a little later. The bulk of the Gothic population, however,
submitted to the Huns and was incorporated into their politico
military system as a separate entity under its own leaders. The next
Germanic tribal federation, the Visi-Goths, located on the northern
bank of the Lower Danube, seeing the defeat of their brethren, offered
no resistance, but gave up their land, crossed the Danube and entered
into the Roman Empire. Thus, the Huns, with a single sweeping
action, arrived at the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in 375
A.D.
Immediately thereafter, the Huns began planning the occupation of
the last western segment of the great Eurasian steppeland, the
Carpathian Lowland, inside the mountainous arc, by concluding pacts
and alliances with their kindred tribes: the Yazigues in the Danube



Tisza quadrangle, the Skirs (= Sikeli) in the western half of the
country, the Carpodari in Upper Hungary, as well as with the Romans
themselves, whose famous general Aetius became their most
important ally. By virtue of these multiple alliances, the Huns gained
control of the whole basin inside the Carpathians, without employing
military force. Since the land was given over to Hun sovereignty
peacefully, without war, and with the blessings of Rome, the local
population had no particular reason to expeet hardship. It remained
intact and offered its services to the Hun king, a friend of Rome. The
Huns set up their permanent head-quarters in the heart of the land, at
the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros, wherefrom King Oktar (
+ 430), King Ruga ( + 434) and thereafter King Attila (+453)
governed their extensive empire. Thus, with the coming of the Huns,
Roman and Germanic dominions in Central Europe were liquidated and
the aborigines liberated.
Aetius continued to court the Huns, even after their installation in
Hungary, encouraging them in their westward advance, in order to
ease the Germanic pressure on the northern borders of the Roman
Empire. For the Huns, the prospect of a possible extension of their
sway upon the whole of Europe was an alluring offer, but, as it turned
out, a miscalculation. King Attila was unable to win a clear victory in
the great battle at Mauriacum, near Troyes, France, in 451. The
immense efforts this war required in men and material, and the
authoritarian manner Attila handled his subalterns, overstrained the
socio-political structure of his realm. So, when Attila suddenly passed
away in 453, his empire crumbled, in large part because of the
intrigues and rebellion of the Germanic tribes. Attila's sons were
defeated in the struggle for the succession (455) and returned with
their clans and kinsmen to Scythia, the tract of land above the Black
Sea, beyond the Carpathian ranges. They did not, however, forget
their ancient grandeur and Prince Csaba, the youngest son of Attila, as



soon as he was back in the old country, began to spread the idea of an
armed return to Pannónia (= Hungary), to take revenge upon the
Germans, whom they considered as the main artisans of their defeat.
On his death-bed, he bound his people by oath, to return to Hungary,
as soon as they had gathered enough strength, to rebuild a Hun state.
Thus, the Huns did not disappear as it was sometimes surmised in
certain historical books. They stayed in the immediate neighbourhood,
waiting until the clock would strike the hour of their return. This
moment arrived in 568.
At that time, a strong federation had come into being with the fusion
of two great tribes: the A vari and Chunni consisting mostly of white
Huns. The name Avari (< H.: A vár-i) means 'He who comes from an
embanked stronghold', and Chunni (< H.: Hun-i, i.e. Hon-i), Huns. J.
Thury, a Hungarian historian, established that 37 different sources
identify the Avars ethnically as Huns (P 059 pp. 113,128). In the
Carpathian basin, they mainly occupied the Great Central Plain and
Transdanubia and also considerable parts of present-day Austria and
Dalmatia. The Avars kept their empire and their independence until 796,
when they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who
destroyed their State, whereby the pendulum swing, once again,
westward.
3. The ethnic identity of the Huns
The true identity of the Huns has not yet been clearly established: "We
know nearly nothing about their early history" and "the history of
Attila is still to be written" (P 061 p. 127). Our evidence on the
anthropological build-up of this nation is scanty, because the Huns
cremated their dead, thereby leaving no direct anthropological traces
of them. Hence, what we know about them comes mostly from
second-hand records. In contemporary and later accounts, the Huns
are said to be of mixed origins, like all nations with an Oriental



background. A major proof of this, as is usually pointed out, was their
skin colour which was generally brownish, although there were typical
white Huns as well. Their colour difference subsisted even in the
fourth and fifth centuries, which indicates that the fusion of the two
racial elements of this people had not yet been achieved at that time.
This state of their ethnic evolution explains why they were not only
called by their common name Huni, but also by other names which
emphasize their racial origin. They were called Kush when their
darkish colouring was more evident (P 092 pp. 14 f., 19-22), and
Aryans (< H.: Uri, Ari), when the white complexion predominated.
King Attila is described in the chronicles as a short-statured, darkish
complexioned man, of haughty walking.(50)
The various appellations of the Huns all have some significance in the
Hungarian language. Their most frequent Huni (< H.: Hon-i) name,
often written without H as Unni, Uni, means 'He who lives in the same
land', i.e. who is a native of the country, a compatriot. It is a
geographic and political term, irrespective of racial origin, as were
also the previously analysed names of Magyar, Hungar, Siculi and
Kelti. Thus, the main connecting link amongst all these peoples was
their common Hungarian language and their identical Oriental origin.
Therefore, they mixed easily, once they were placed under a same
sovereignty. And there can be no mistake if Attila is referred to as the
King of Hungary (rex Hungáriáé), since the Huni were considered as
Hungarians (Huni sive Hungari).
In addition to their general names (Huns, Kush, Hungarians) the
various factions of this people also came under local denominations.
(51) These secondary names were mainly noticed after the collapse of
the Hun Empire, when several smaller political entities came into
being. These names usually included the distinctive word -Ág- Ur
'Ruler of the branch so and so'. Examples: Kutzi-Ág-Űr, Hun-Ág-Ur, Sár
Ág-Ur. The ethnic identity of the Huns is nevertheless best evidenced



by their own written records, which we discovered and which we are
now going to analyse in more detail.
4. Hun-symbols and written records
It is often assumed that the Huns were an illiterate, barbaric people
who left no written records. This opinion actually stems from the
inability of scholars to identify and decipher their script. In fact, as
shown below, the Huns bequeathed us with a considerable amount of
written records, most of which turned up in Hungary, the one-time
centre of their vast empire. Apart from sources of archaeological
provenance, diplomatic records also mention their ability to write and
to read. We have, in this respect, the rare testimony of Priscos Rhetor,
one of the most credible observers of the Huns, who led an embassy to
the court of King Attila. He mentions in his report that the King
requested the extradition of certain fugitive Huns, whose names he
read out in his presence from small wooden sticks, from the Byzantine
emperor. Another proof of the Huns' writing ability is the fact that the
incised or carved script was always called a "Hun writing", "Hun
letters" and "Alphabet of the Huns" in Hungary. The legend about
illiterate Huns must be abandoned.
Most existing Hun inscriptions have gold as supporting material and
as such display a solemn character. But the daily records which Priscos
Rhetor himself had mentioned were made on wood or on other
perishable material, which deteriorated and are now lost for ever.
Another preliminary question to be answered is whether the existing
Hun inscriptions, especially those engraved upon expensive materials,
could have really belonged to them at all. We have no reason to doubt
this, since our historical sources are positive in stating that the Hun
kings were, in general, fond of gold, like all Oriental rulers. We read
in these records that Attila's dining table was made of solid gold, and
his cooking dishes were also of gold.(52) The same sources mention



the existence of a huge Hun golden treasure, which later on became
the property of the Hungarian kings by law of succession and was
always kept in Hungary, at the royal court. The treasure included the
legendary sword of Attila, the so-called Sword of God, implying
Attila's divine origin. Moreover, Hungarian medieval charters certify
that Ottokár II of Bohemia was asked to restitute all the gold to the
King of Hungary, which his grandmother, Ann of Masovia, unlawfully
carried away from Hungary to Bohemia. Amongst these precious
jewels "was an expensive gold dish, adorned with the finest and most
beautiful precious stones, as well as many other famous jewels, which
were kept in Hungary from the time of Attila, king of Hungary, and his
successors until now."(53) The listed data dispel even the slightest
doubt one may have that Attila had been the owner of gold dishes and
other precious jewels, which were inscribed.
On the following pages we will show a few Hun symbols, to begin
with, which were used for the purpose of identifying the ruler by
means of homo-phony, i.e. the pictorial method of writing which was
common to all Oriental rulers during Antiquity. Attila's best known
such symbol was the Ast-Ur bird, whose image he wore on his shield.
This word sounds like Est-Ura, 'Ruler of the West'. This title may have
originated from the time when he was only ruling the western half of
the Hun Empire, his brother Bleda having been in charge of the
eastern part. Furthermore, Attila was also called God's Whip, which is
another play on sound for the same title, whip being Ostor in
Hungarian, homophonic with Est-Ur. Finally, a widely used Hun badge
was the stylized insect having the outlines of a bee (H.: Méh), which
identified its bearer (Ur, Ar), as Méh-Ar, i.e. Mahar or Magyar.(54)
Another group of Hun-identifying objects consisted of quadrupeds:
mostly dogs, foxes, and wolves. They were used as totems,
designating the clan from which they had originated. On the basis of
such assumed names, certains Huns could have considered themselves



as "Sons of the Dog" or "Sons of the Fox". King Ruga was probably 'Fox'
(H.: Róka), while King Oktar may have been 'Mr. Dog' (H.: A kutya
ur). The speech of the Huns, especially their battle-cry, was said to
resemble "the roaring of lions" (P 099 pp. 64, 147, 178).(55)
The author has deciphered several of the Hun inscriptions which are
engraved upon gold dishes, found at Nagy-Szent-Miklós, to the south
of the river Maros, which was the central district of the Hun Empire.
The cache was discovered in 1791 and yielded 23 pieces (dishes,
juges, goblets, etc.), all made of solid gold, weighing altogether 9,925
gr. The commodities were probably not for everyday use, because they
are conserved in almost perfect condition, without any trace of wear
or tear. It is likely that the purpose of these jewels was rather to
preserve important historical messages for the progeny, like royal
records. In addition to the individual inscriptions, five richly adorned
vessels (numbered 9, 10, 17, 22 and 23) bear an identical short script.
It always reads from right to left and was written in memory of the
goldsmith who made the decorations: pictures and interwoven
figures. The script (Fig. 32) reads in Hungarian thus: áR-U Ké-Pé.T 1
T.eR.éK U.N CSi-Ná.Ta, in present Hungarian orthography: Árú képét
egy derék hun csinálta, in English: 'The adornment of this article was
made by a skilled Hun.'



Fig. 33. Hungarian language message engraved upon a Hunnic
gold tray. Treasure of Nagy-Szent-Miklós, Hungary.
A longer inscription appears on a gold tray (Fig. 33), marvellously
adorned with a Tree of Life (genealogical tree), flanked on both sides
by two stylized attendant animals. In the higher ranking position there
are two dog-like creatures with pointed ears, and on the second one
are two quadripeds with birds' beaks. The picture may point out the
two major Magyar-speaking peoples of Hungary at that time: Huns
and Magyars. The one line inscription below the picture reads from
right to left and is transliterated thus: aD-iSZ.eN iR-T eR.aN-O.Ni
Ro.Ko.N-oK E.L-aT-Ne-Fe-Ke E.L-T-eK J-U Fó-T, in present Hungarian
spelling it would be thus: A díszen irt Irán-honi rokonok állatnevekkel
éltek; jó volt. Its meaning: 'The Iranian relatives represented on the
ornament, used to live under assumed animal names; that was an
advantage.'
The longest inscription shown here is engraved upon a golden dish of
which there are two identical ones (Fig. 34). Its distinctive feature is
an equilateral cross-sign, placed in the middle of the dish, and is
surrounded by a circular inscription. It was executed with great care,
no doubt because it was King Oktar's royal seal, bearing his full title.
We shall not enter into discussing the complicated meaning of the
cross-sign, but only of the script itself, which reads counter-clockwise,
starting at the 12 o'clock position. The transliteration of the signs is
thus: Ne.Te.T.I-K uN Ki.Rá O.K.T.áR O.R-SZ-E-EGe A.Ra-K Jo.K-oN Ve



Te P-A.Ra-To.K-T-O(l) Po.N-T.I-aK I.SZ.T(er) Vi-Té.Ki-E-K O.Ra-Li-aK
Tó.T-oK U-RA. In full Hungarian: Negyedik hun király Oktár országa.
Örök jogon vette barátoktól. Pontiak, Ister vidékiek, Uraliak, Tótok ura.
In English: 'Realm of the fourth Hun king Oktar. He bought it from
friends by hereditary right. He is the ruler of those living above the
Pontus (= the Black Sea), in the Ister (= Danubian) region, in the
Ural area and of the Slavonic peoples.'
Fig. 34. The great seal of King Oktár the Hun with legend in
Hungarian.
The last Hunnic inscription we will be discussing was found outside



Hungary. It is incised on the pendant of a necklace found in Wolfheim,
Rhein-land. The name of the village where it was found, signifies the
'Dwelling Place of Wolves', a typical Hun designation. The relic comes,
in all probability, from a group of Huns who found refuge there after
the collapse of their Empire. The message on it was prepared with
philological precision (Fig. 35) and is transliterated thus: E.N-G-aR
N.E-N-eT.oL EL-O.N-A.N-aK Na.T.A-P.A Ungár nénitől Ilonának,
Nagyapa 'From Aunt Ungar to Helen, Grandfather.'
The contemporary written documents of the Huns constitute the decisive
evidence that these people were literate, having strong cultural relations
with ancient Egypt, and spoke Hungarian. Their records repeatedly say
that they originated from the Ancient Near East (Iran), and had
acquired their Carpathian land peacefully, by virtue of diplomatic
accords.

5. The bad image of the Huns in Western Europe
After all we have said about the Huns, the question that comes to
mind is how could they have had such bad press in western Europe to
this day. This hatred is focussed mainly upon King Attila, the most
brilliant figure of his race, secondly, upon the Hun people themselves.
As is disclosed from the analysis regarding this subject (P 099 and P
072), chronicler Jordanes, a man of Gothic descent, started the
defamation. It was he who invented the tale that Attila was not a



human being, but rather a monster, born from the love of a dog and a
witch and had a doglike appearance (canis aspersus), with pointed ears.
This monster image has come into circulation, in all probability,
through misinterpretation of the Hun custom of using animal symbols
to indicate their tribal or national appurtenance. So, when the Huns
said that they originated from a wolf or a dog, the naive western
priests and chronicle-writers took these expressions literally, and
justified their abhorrent image with the Huns' own words.
The Huns' monster image was confirmed by a second feature, namely
that God had selected the Hun king to fulfill the ungrateful mission to
be God's whip (flagellum Dei), a kind of Anti-Christ, to punish,
especially the Latin peoples, for their wickedness and crimes. This
second gossip originated obviously from the misinterpretation of the
Huns' original symbol, the whip, which in their symbolism, meant
simply that Attila was the ruler of West, as explained above. Thus the
whip in the hand of Attila had as little to do with a punishing mission
as the one in the hands of Egyptian Pharaohs. If Jordanes, this first
western propagandist, could have had the opportunity to travel
throughout the Hun Empire, he probably would have avoided
spreading so much inconsistency amongst his countrymen. Herodotus,
almost a thousand years earlier, did his reportage on the Scythians
more conscientiously. He spared no trouble and travelled to Olbia, on
the Black Sea shore, to gather firsthand information. The description
of Priscos Rhetor is similarly much more accurate because he had met
Attila personally.
Ordinary Huns were also heaped with slander. It was asserted that
they were subhuman beings, the descendants of Scythian witches and
of unspecified devils, and that their way of life consisted only of
looting, perpetrating robberies and killings. And their speech? Oh,
they did not have any, their mouth could only give out short and
inarticulate sounds like fleeing animals.(56) This latest Hun-feature



also originated from the miscomprehension of the metaphor,
according to which the Hun battle-cry was likened to the roaring of
lions, as the ancient Egyptian kings have done when in battle. To sum
up, all the interpretations the Westerners invented reflect their naivety,
lack of experience and a great deal of bad faith.
The Hun armies never sacked Rome, the holy city of Christendom,
although they could have done so in 452, having arrived at the gates
of the City. In the western interpretation this was not due to Attila's
orders, but to a miracle: the apostles Peter and Paul appeared with
shining sabres above Attila's head, and this sight frightened the
would-be robber who fled. Thereafter, the lucky city was, however,
repeatedly robbed and burned by Germanic tribes. First by the Visi
Goths of Alaric in 410 A.D., and then by the Vandals of Gaiseric in
455, when the two saintly apostles failed to pull out their sabres to
chase away the real robbers. But such arguments would carry no
weight with the makers of myths who persisted in their belief that
with the Huns, the scum of Earth had inundated Europe.
The traditional Hun-phobia of medieval western writers clouded the
clairvoyance of the modern historians as well who were unable to
reason otherwise and saw in Attila the prototype of the Barbar: the
uncut, savage man who built nothing and destroyed everything for the
sake of destruction. They forget that the mass-murderer Julius
Caesar was the true scourge of God in Antiquity, and that the words
Vandal and Vandalism, were not a Hunnic, but of western origin.
Fortunately, Hungarian historians have never accepted the Hun-image
elaborated by their western colleagues. For them, King Attila was the
first great Magyar ruler in Europe, who liberated their forefathers
from the western yoke, stopped both Roman and Germanic
penetration, and rolled back the invaders of the Carpatho-Danubian
basin thus preserving the precious ethnic and political equilibrium in



central Europe. Hungarian historians, also, did not ignore the military
genius of Attila, and stated emphatically, that the Huns had not only a
highly developed culture, but that they had doubtlessly surpassed
western civilization which was at that time, in its darkest "dark age"
(decadence of the Roman and Byzantine empires). Even Charlemagne,
the great Frankish ruler, could not sign his name.
We have to admit, however, that the western historians of today are
making efforts to form a more truthful view of the Huns, bringing it
more into harmony with our modern scholarly standards. After this
cleansing operation, all the incredible features of the Hun-portrait
have been discarded, notably those concerning the Huns' monstruous
origin, their animal language and their so-called earthly mission. But
it will be some time until past conventional wisdom is replaced by the
results of modern research. As an illustration of this process, we read,
in a recent publication, the admission that "the threat which they (the
Huns) had posed to western civilization has probably been
exaggerated" (P 104 p. 69). German authors recognize that the Huns,
as body-guards, were more reliable than their own fellow countrymen.
(57) It shall also be noted that, after all, the central figure of the
German sagas was precisely Attila (cf. Nibelungenlied). Germans even
want to claim that Attila was one of their kinsmen, his name being a
Germanic word, meaning something like "Daddy".(58) It is really high
time that the distorted image of the Huns, this dark blot on western
historiography, make way for some more serious consideration, wherein
the great-power status of the Huns and their world-empire are
acknowledged and appreciated at their proper value.

THE MAGYAR HUNGARIANS



1. Massive influx of Magyars into the Carpathian Land and the
birth of Hungary-I
After the collapse of the Hun rule in Hungary (453), the major
Germanic tribes of the country — Goths, Gepids and Longobards (the
latter since 526 only), — set up individual principalities and quarreled
violently amongst themselves. The Longobards were striving for
predominance but, not having the necessary strength to achieve it,
asked a Hun faction of Eastern Europe to help them defeat their rivals.
With the support of this Magyar tongued faction called Avari (Avars),
the Longobards drove out the Gepids, but felt so insecure in their
domain that they deemed it advisable to evacuate Hungary. They
actually fled to Italy in 568, together with their families. After that, the
Avar Hungarians set up their own kingdom (568-803) in the entire
Carpathian area. At the beginning, the Avar Kingdom extended from
the Don in the East to the Enns in the West. Later it shrank and
covered only the Carpathian basin, the Vienna Plain and the
Bohemian Plateau.
There was much speculation about the ethnic identity of the Avars.
But it seems certain that they already spoke Hungarian when they first
appeared on the scene of history. Their name Avari (< H.: A vár-i)
means, indeed 'Those who live in enclosures (Rings)'. And the throne
name of their first great ruler, under whose leadership they entered
the Carpathian land, was Baján (< H.: Be-Jön), a homophon of 'He
who comes in'. More information is available about the ethnic identity
of the second Avar ethnic wave (670), composed of "White
Hungarians", as is definitely stated in the Russian chronicle of Nestor.
The vastness of Magyar human material that settled thus in Hungary
at that time is reflected by the great number of their graves which
have been excavated, 40,000. The newcomers occupied the edges of
the Great Central Plain, and Transdanubia, and also southern
Hungary, i.e. the best arable lands of the country. The seat of their



government was in Györ (< H.: Gyürü = 'Ring'), a strategically
located and well fortified stronghold at the confluence of the Raba
river and the Danube. The Hungarian chroniclers never use the term
Avar when speaking about them. They call them simply Hungarians,
as do the majority of West-European chronicles as well. They add, at
best, a few adjectives for the sake of a clarification, like "Avars who
are called Hungarians" {Avari qui dicuntur Ungari); "Avars who are
called Huns and Hungarians as well" (Avari qui et Huni sive Hungari).
By the same token, un Avar king is mentioned with the title of "King of
Hungary". The latter has been a famous ruler because his daughter
Berthe became the wife of Pepin and subsequently the mother of
Charlemagne. The quoted data clearly suggest that from 670 onwards,
the Magyars already formed a united nation in the Car-patho
Danubian basin and had an organized State headed by kings. That
was a historical event, and this explains why Prince Arpad could set
up a smoothly working State-apparatus so easily after his entry into
the land. For him, the help of the Hungarians in the Rings was
inevaluable.
The Avar-Hungarian kingdom lasted for about two and a half
centuries. Afterwards, the reorganized Frank Empire resumed past
Germanic expansion toward the East under the half-Hungarian
Charlemagne (771-814) who organized a series of razzias against
Hungary between 796 and 803 and destroyed its central government.
Charlemagne was not much interested in territorial gains. He
preferred to loot the Rings, where the nation's treasures — gold, silver
and precious stones — were guarded. On a single occasion, for
example, he 'collected' so much treasures that 14 wagons were needed
to cart them away from Hungary. Chronicler Eginard (Einhard)
commented on that big haul by saying: "According to human memory,
there was no earlier war in which the Franks have become as wealthy
as just now; for until now, they were poor" (cf. P 098 pp. 113, 240).



As regards the Magyar population of Avar-Hun-gary, it survived the
loss of their State and continued to live almost undisturbed. The
largest administrative unit which continued to function was that
located around Lake Fertő, a rather swampy region in western
Hungary. It was last mentioned in 873. A second surviving mini-state
was the realm of Tudun, in Upper Hungary. This one endured until the
coming of Arpad in 895. The harmful consequence of Frankish
incursions into Hungary was the creation of a politico-military vacuum
in a so vitally strategic part of Central Europe, which caused a lot of
inconveniences both to the local population and to the Germans as
well. Therefore, emissaries were sent to the East-European Arpad
Hungarians even by the German king Arnulf who urged them to come
in to help stabilize the situation. The craving for a new unifier was
fulfilled in 895, with the entry on the scene of Prince Arpad. His coming
opened a new chapter in Central Europe's history.
2. Hungary's ethnographic and political conditions in the IXth
century
1. In the previous chapters we have explained how Magyar-speaking
ethnic groups continuously poured into the Carpathian land, ever
since Neolithic times. They came in successive waves, in increasing
numbers and under various denominations: Magyars, Székely, Kush,
Scythians, Celts, Huns, Avars, etc. Their common starting point was
the Ancient Near-East and they were linked by ethnic, cultural and
linguistic ties. This morphological coherence of the early Hungarians
is probably the most important discovery in our recent historical
science.(59) Now, it will be interesting to find out whether the earliest
population and its descendants were still evident in the IXth century,
at the eve of Arpad's coming.
A first indication of the presence of Magyars is that the mountain-,
river- and village-names they had imparted to the geographic features



of the land were still all in use. Furthermore, their identification
symbols: the bird, the bee, the lion and the ram were also deeply
embedded in the folklore, which was strongly impregnated with
suncult and with general Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Syrian
connections. All that would be impossible to explain without the
continuous presence of the same population and, what is more,
several other reliable sources especially mention the presence of
Hungarians in the land at the said time. During the reign of
Charlemagne's successors, for example, a bishop Hungarus by name, is
mentioned in a charter of 888, and Louis the German, for his part,
refers to a mountain called Marca Vengeriorum, in his charter of 860
and even Charlemagne had several times referred to a Hungarian
stronghold in Transdanubia, Sárvár by name (P 059 pp. 241-242).
And, above all, there is a recently discovered Hungarian chronicle
which survived through a Turkish translation (XVIth century), which
states that the Hungarians of Arpad were greatly pleased to learn,
upon their arrival in that country, that its inhabitants spoke the same
language as they did. Thus it is evident that Hungary was already
populated with Hungarian-speaking people before the coming of
Arpad.
2. Anonymus, our best informer on the IXth century events, records in
his Gesta Hungarorum (c. 1200), that the Arpadians, upon entering
the Carpathian basin, had found a large population there whom he
calls Sclaui, Rameni and Blachi. Scholars have been baffled by these
names he alone mentions, all the more since the proffered
explanations led to chronological and linguistic absurdities. Who were
these peoples? The etymological approach gives us the first important
key to this mystery. The Sclaui name, to begin with, is a Hungarian
compound word which includes the following elements: S-K-Lau-i. At
its ending we notice the adjectival suffix -i, usually meaning 'Follower
of, 'Coming from'. The word Lau, which precedes the suffix, is the



dialectal form of the literary Ló, whose first meaning is 'Horse'. In
ancient times, however, the Sungod was meant by it, who was
imagined as riding upon a horse in the sky.(60) The remaining part of
the word, S-K, when vocalised appears as As Ék, or in softened form:
Az Ég, and means 'The Sky'. Thus the whole compound S-K-Lau-i = Az
Égi Ló-i means literally 'Follower of the Heavenly God', i.e. sunwor
shippers. Consequently, the form Sclaui is not an ethnic denomination,
but a religious one, meaning simply sunworshippers.
The Sclaui dwelt all over the land, but their main settlement areas
were in Transdanubia and in Upper Hungary. Now, these regions were
exactly the same ones where the Székely-Hungarians (,Sikeli, Sikeloi,
Siculi) lived until their partial transfer into Transylvania. Incidentally,
their name includes the very same three consonants, S-K-L, which are
to be found in the name of
S-K-Lau-i. Furthermore, in the present-day Székely local language the
word Ló (horse) is often pronounced as Lau, and means, when used as
a title, not horse, but Lord, as in the nobiliary title Ló-Fö 'Highborn
Man, Marquis'. Finally, the Si-keli were also ardent worshippers of the
Sun and their popular art is full of the symbols of the ancestral
suncult. Their name, in the form used two thousand years earlier, was
also analyzed as signifying 'Follower of the Heavenly Lord'. Upon the
basis of so many similarities, we must concede that Anonymus had, no
doubt, meant that group of Hungarian-speaking people under the word
Sclaui, which was mentioned in earlier sources as Sikeloi, i.e. the
present-day Székely, a group probably originating from the
Mesopotamian cultural sphere.
According to Anonymus' narration, the Rameni were natives of
Transdanubia. Their name contained the following components: Ra
Mén-i, a fine Old Hungarian word, meaning 'Follower of the Divine
Stallion', i.e. again sunworshippers, but this time of Egyptian



persuasion. This term probably meant a Hun faction (Huni or Honi =
'Native'), whose name he renders in Latin as habitatores terrae. — The
third group of Hungarians mentioned by Anonymus in their religious
context were the Blachi who used the carved script to write, remarks
the chronicler. This fact alone strongly suggests that they originated
from the Syrian cultural sphere. Their name confirms it, since its
etymological meaning is the Hungarian Bal-Lak-i 'Originating from
Baal's Dwelling', Baal being the Syrian Divinity of Fire', a local variant
of sunworshippers. They are also called Balasi or Blasi, a synonym
meaning 'He who comes from Baal's House'. There are many
Hungarian place-names compounded with the divine name Baal, such
as Bala, Balaton, Bala-vár, Bálványos, Bélkö, etc. The same name
occurs outside Hungary, in such well known geographic names as the
Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic Sea and region, Belgium, etc. Julius
Caesar mentions in his De bello Gallico that Volok (Volcae) people
were living, together with Rutheni, on the northern foothills of the
Pyrenees (P 030 II p. 36 and Index and map). That all these groups of
peoples were mentioned in their religious connections is revealed by a
remark by Anonymus, a Christian priest, who said that the Sclaui and
Blachi were the most wicked people of the whole world, simply
because they served pagan divinities (viliores homines esse totius
mundi quia essent Blasii et Sclaui, P 120 I p. 66).
The continuous use of Near-Eastern religious names is an obvious
proof that the descendants of the Neolithic and Bronze Age
inhabitants of Hungary still formed the bulk of the population in the
IXth century A.D. Nonetheless, it is impossible to make an
approximate calculation about their numerical strength on the eve of
Arpad's coming. We can only guess their relative importance, on the
basis of a specific archaeological fact: from the late Avar period,
Hungary has 40,000 authentic excavated graves, whereas from the
period of the reunification of the land under Arpad, we only possess



10,000. That would mean that the proportion of long settled
Hungarians to the Arpa-dian newcomers, was 4 to 1. The survival of
Hungarians of diverse religious affiliations in the Danube basin since the
Neolithic and Bronze Ages makes them the most ancient inhabitants of
Europe, who were capable of preserving their original ethnic, linguistic
and cultural identity throughout millenia.
3. To complete our survey of the situation in the Danube basis toward
the end of the IXth century, before the arrival of the last major
Hungarian ethnic wave, we must take a look at the political build-up of
the land. It was a chaotic one, because after the destruction of the
Avar-Hungarian State in 803, the country's organization, in the
absence of a central government, relapsed to tribalism and
regionalism. In north-western or Upper Hungary, there existed a small
post-Avar principality centred around the fortress of Nyitra and well
protected by high mountains. Its existence was continuously
mentioned in historical annals until 875, date of its conversion to
Christianity. Upper Hungary's most famous ruler was Prince Tudun,
whose name is last mentioned in a charter of Pope Eugene II in 826,
wherein he was admonished for building Christian churches (P 109 II
p. 35). Tudun is an
Oriental throne-name (< H.: Tudó-(H)Ona: Tóth-Hon) meaning 'Land
of God Thot' (the Egyptian divinity). At the time of the re-unification
of the country under Arpad, the ruler of that region was Prince Zobor
(<H.: Az Avar) meaning 'The Avar ruler'.
South of Upper Hungary, up to the River Raba, and including the Fertő
Lake, lay a second post-Avar principality. Its administrative centre was
Győr ( =H.: Gyürü 'Ring'). Other minor principalities were around
Lake Balaton. All these western Hungarian post-Avar principalities
were given more freedom of action after the division of the Frank
Empire into three nationally based political entities in 843. They



utilized their liberty by seeking help from their fellow Hungarians,
beyond the Carpathian arc, in Eastern Europe.
The Great Central Plain of Hungary was under the nominal sovereignty
of the Bulgarian Empire and was governed by native princes. At its
southern end, in the Danube-Tisza quadrangle, lived the Alan people
called Yazigues; they were obedient to Prince Salan (<H. Az Alán)
'The Alan'. The separate identity of the Yazigues had already been
erased in the Hun period, but their administrative autonomy subsisted
until 1848. The northern portion of the Central Plain was under the
authority of another local prince, Laborci by name, who ruled from his
fortress-city of Hungvár, 'Hun Fortress', according to Anonymus.
To the east of the Tisza, extending up to the Carpathians three small
principalities flourished. The strongest of them ruled in the region of
Szamos and Körös, with a military base in the mountain fortress of
Bihar. The last ruler of this principality was Mén-Marut, whose throne
name meant 'Sungod's Stallion' (Mén = Stallion; Maruth = the Hindu
name of the Sungod). This monarch lived in Oriental fashion, he even
sported a harem at his court, and ruled over a mixed population called
Chozari (<H.: Kos-Ar-i). The second eastern Hungarian ruler, Dux
Gelu or Gyula, governed the Upper Maros area in Ul-transylvania,
'Beyond the forested Land', his throne-seat being at Gyalu. He was
probably a priest-king, whose symbol, a torch, was carried before him
when he travelled officially (P 120 I p. 95). Another high official of
this petty kingdom identified himself by wearing a sun-disk. The last
Gyula maintained his quasi-sovereign status until the reign of King St.
Stephen (1000-1038), who had him captured and imprisoned for life,
"because he was an inveterate pagan, refusing to become a Christian
and was, in many ways, an annoyance to St. Stephen", writes
Anonymus. — The third and last east -Hungarian petty kingdom
included the area bounded by the rivers Maros, Tisza and the Lower
Danube, with a royal residence at Orsova (= Ur Szava) 'Voice of the



Ruler', like the post-Hittite state in the Ancient Orient, Ar-zawa. The
Prince's name in Latin script was Glad or Clad; it is the softened form
of the original Hungarian word Keleti, i.e. 'Oriental'.
As has been proven in the foregone analysis, all the princes and their
petty kingdoms mentioned in the historical sources of the IXth century
definitely bore Hungarian names and ruled over a Hungarian
speaking population. Prof. János Me-lich, a very conscientious linguist,
came to the same conclusion in his last important scientific paper (P
097). He re-examined the pre-Arpadian prince-list and found that
Menmarut and Glad were certainly native Magyars and that all the
other local rulers spoke "faultless Magyar". He also stated that the
great majority of Hungary's population spoke Hungarian on the eve of
Arpad's coming and was racially inter-related.
3. The formation of the Arpadian people in Eastern Europe
Recent historical studies emphasize that the human mass led by Arpad
into the Carpatho-Dan-ubian basin, significantly differed from those
Hungarians already living in that country. The Arpa-dians evolved,
indeed, their ethnic constitution during the sixth to the ninth centuries
only, by merging with westward-moving Hungarian and Turkish
peoples, on the Eastern European Plain. This all began with the
sudden entry of the Turks into the Caspian-Oxus-Aral area in 568 A.D.
That first blow was followed by a second and more violent one in 597
598. As a result, all the tribes living in the southwestern corner of the
great Eurasian steppe began to roll westwards.
The Turks were mostly stock-breeding, mounted nomads of inner
Asiatic origin, having various independent branches, like the Bisseni,
Chasari and Cumani, to mention only those with whom the Magyars
were to come into closer contact. They had their own language, which
has borrowed heavily from the Hungarian vocabulary, and which,



most likely, also included their historical names. In fact, their names
seem to have been given by Hungarians, since they all have a definite
meaning in that language. The word Turki (anc. form: Tourki), seems
to have resulted from the merging of four elements into a single word:
Tó-Ur-Kö-i, meaning literally 'Those who dwell (-i), in the Land (Kö),
of the Ruler (Ur) of the Lake (Tó)', in short 'Lake Dwellers.' The
implied lake was no doubt, the Aral Sea, because it is surrounded by a
lowland called Touran (< H.: Tó-Ur-Hon), 'Home of the Lake Lord'.
The name Bisseni, Pissoni or Pice-Nati (< H.: Pis-Hon-i; today: Viz
Honi) means 'He who lives by the Water'; and Pice-Nati, in inverted
word order (< H.: Nagy-Viz-i) 'He who lives by the Large Water',
probably referring to the Caspian Sea, for originally they had actually
lived on its shores. As regards the Chasars (Khazari, Chosari) their
name is a compound with Kos +Ar + i, i.e. descendants from the
merging of (white) Aryans and (darkish) Kush peoples, as rightly
observed by the Arab writer, Abu-i-Feda, who said: "The Khazars... are
of two types: some are dark-skinned, often almost black; these are
considered as being of Hindu descent. The second race is white
skinned and exceedingly beautiful" (quoted in P 081 p. 56). In the
beginning, the Khazars dwelt on the northern shore of the Caspian
Sea, whose original 'Hyrcania' (= Aryan) name was changed into
Caspis (< H.: Kush-Viz) 'Water of the Kush'. Ail this points to the
important fact that the Turki peoples were a combination of the
subjugated Aryan and Kush population, with a significant admixture of
Mongol elements.
The first Turkish ethnic branch with which the Arpadians came into
close political union were the Khazars, as was recently demonstrated
by Arthur Koestler (P 079) and Vilmos Kovács (P 081). The Khazars
spoke the Tchuvash dialect of Turkish and had laid the foundation of
their empire in the second half of the Vlth century, more exactly in
567. They became the mightiest power in Eastern Europe in the VHth,



Vlllth and IXth centuries. They had extended their domain over the
entire area to the north of the Caucasian ranges, and subjected the
westermost seven Magyar tribes, living between the Kuban and Don
rivers, to their rule, as well as those who dwelt between the Kuma and
Terek rivers, on the western coast of the Caspian. All these Magyar
tribes living in Caucasia, originated from northern Mesopotamia, the
Kingdom of Urartu, and from the post-Hittite states of Syria, especially
from the Kingdoms of Arpad, Karkemish and Damasek (Damask).
They had to leave their old fatherlands, following the bloody
expansion of the Semitic Assyrian Empire, in the second and first
milleniums B.C. In our historical sources, the memory of the
Hungarians at the Don has been preserved under the name of Dentu
Magaria and of those of the Kuma valley as Kum-Magaria.
The Hungarians of Dentu-Magaria have been incorporated into the
Khazar Empire in 568 A.D. and their symbiosis lasted for over three
hundred years. They were entrusted with the all-important task of
safeguarding the western flank of the Khazar Empire and to block the
descent of the Slavonic peoples toward the south. To fulfill their duties
more efficaciously, the seven Magyar tribes in question were
transferred later to a more suitable location, between the Don and
Dnieper, above the Black Sea. The same strategic considerations led
the Khazars to place the Magyar tribes under a single command, for
which Arpad was selected. His installation as 'Deputy king' was carried
out according to Khazar customs, by elevating him on shields. And the
leaders of the seven tribes, for their part, swore allegiance to Arpad,
solemnly declaring that they would faithfully carry out his orders. All
that may have happened around 850, which may be considered the
birth-date of the East-European Hungarian nation, the Danubian one
having already been in existence for a long time.
The Khazar-Hungarian alliance worked well for about two hundred



years, but when the Khazar king adopted the Judaic faith around 740
and forced it upon his court and military men, the first internal
tensions were quick to appear. A civil war erupted in which the rebels
were defeated. As a result, three deeply involved Khazar tribes, called
Kabars, went over to Hungarian side and were absorbed into their
socio-political system. Then came the renewed attack of the fearful
Bisseni-Turks, who had torn away the pasture-land from the Magyars
and forced them to move more westwards (889), into the Dnieper
Seret-Lower-Dan-ube area, thereby severing their secular alliance with
the Khazars completely. At that time, they had already acquired
enough political maturity to make their own decisions as to the best
way to ensure their survival in social surroundings that were growing
more and more precarious.
Their own worry, which was also shared by the Danubian Hungarians,
gave rise in c. 890 to the idea of merging the two Hungarian nations
into one, inside the spacious Carpathian arena which could be
defended more easily than any tribal community on the unbroken,
vast plain beyond the Carpathians. In the meantime, they had to fight
a mysterious battle against the Cuman-Turks near Kiev, of which we
have no details. It is definitely known, however, that the Cumans'
seven tribes were defeated and that they swore an oath of allegiance
to Arpad and then they too were absorbed into the constantly swelling
Magyar conglomerate, which already consisted of seventeen tribes.
Finally, the descendants of Prince Csaba, the youngest son of King
Attila, also joined the Arpadians, together with their innumerable
clans and cognates of the same region. After all these happenings, the
people Arpad led into Hungary were considerably different from the
Danubian Hungarians. Racially, they were of Aryan, Kush and
Mongolian factions. By religion, they were sunworshippers,
fireadorers, Ismaelits and Moslems. Ethnically, they had strong Turkish
traits, bearing such names as Magyar, Khazar, Kabar, Kuman, Hun,



Bisseni, etc. —a real mosaic with a Turkish veneer. In the Byzantine
court they were classified simply as Turki, and not Hungarians. How
did it happen then, that they could, nevertheless, build a Hungary
with all its components and not a 'Turkey'?
4. The re-unification of the country and the birth of Hungary-II as
a modern state
1. After the destruction of the Avar-Hungarian Kingdom by the Franks
in 783-803, the whole Carpathian land relapsed into a state of
political anarchy and became a battlefield for half a dozen dukedoms
and neighbouring great powers. No wonder that the Hungarians
already in the land, had sent emissaries to their brethren on the other
side of the Carpathians, urging them to move in to rebuild, together
with their united forces, the realm of their great ancestor, King Attila.
The Arpadians received similar suggestions from the interested great
powers, namely from King Arnulf (887-899) of Germany, and the
Byzantine emperor Leo the Wise (886-912) to help achieve their own
political objectives. By this means, the Arpadians had several
opportunities of exploring their future land, especially in 862, 881 and
892. All our evidence points to the fact that the vital decision was
already taken in 892.
The preparations for the conquest were in full swing at that time. In
Kiev, where Almus, the father of Arpad was the deputy-king, all the
available blacksmiths were summoned to make hundreds of thousands
of horseshoes, arrows, cartwheels, swords and the like, which were all
kept in storage. Three hundred lumber jacks were also engaged to
clear a passage through the thick forest. A pincer movement was
planned, according to which the bulk of the invaders would penetrate
into Hungary under the leadership of Arpad through the Verecke-pass,
which had never been used before (841 m above s.-l.), and the second
army, under the command of Arpad's father Almus or his elder son



Levente, was supposed to check the Bulgarian forces and penetrate
into Transylvania through its passes and gorges. The invasion started
in the spring of 895 and, except for the unexpected attack of the
Bisseni and Bulgarians, the Hungarian armies met inside the
Carpathian arc during the summer of the same year, as planned. By
900, the entire territory was in their hands, including Transdanubia.
The incoming Arpadians were greeted as liberators and most of the
native populations surrendered spontaneously to the new master of
the land and even helped with the unification. Those few princes and
dukes who failed to change their allegiance in time, paid dearly for
their mistake. Laborci, Gelu and Zubur who resisted, were killed in
action. Two others, Salan and Glad, fled with their followers. The case
of the sixth prince, Men-marut, was a particular one, insofar as he had
wanted to resist at first, but, at the sight of Arpad's armed men, had
asked for a compromise, offering his daughter in marriage to Arpad's
youngest son Zsolt, while he himself swore obedience to Arpad. In
exchange, he was permitted to keep his stronghold of Bihar as a fief
for life. History knows of very few conquests as clean as Arpad's, which
was accomplished practically without bloodshed.
As soon as the territorial unification of the land was achieved, Arpad
summoned the leaders to his fortress of Csongrád and hammered out
the principles ('Constitution'), according to which the reunified
country was to be governed. The next step consisted of setting up
nation-wide institutions, to bind all the inhabitants of Hungary
together into indissoluble unity. These institutions were almost
exclusively, the creation of the native, and not of the half-way
Turkized Hungarians. In other words, the newcomers were culturally
absorbed into the Magyar-speaking local population which formed the
overwhelming majority in the land. This process is well illustrated by
the following remarks. The unified country became a "kingdom" (and
not a khanat according to the Turkish pattern), with a "king" as its



ruler (and not a khan or kende). The highest officials were the Maior
Domus Nádor and the Chief Justice, Ország-biró (and not Horka and
Kádár). The king was represented as someone seated upon a throne
(and not in a saddle on horseback). The symbolic animal identifying
the king was a lion (and not a hyena, ram or dog). One of the most
important institutions, which welded and kept the various elements of
the society together, resulted from the adoption of Christianity. The
new faith imposed, indeed, a common and uniform ideology, and
replaced the pagan Sun-, Fire-, and Baal-cults, which had earlier kept
the nation divided into several parts. Thus, the merging of all
Hungarians of diverse origins, creeds and political traditions into a single
nation was achieved within a relatively short lapse of time.

2. Prince Arpad (+ 907) was not only a military genius but a
successful organizer as well. He clearly perceived the geographic unity
and the strategic position of the Carpathian arena, welded between
two powerful empires. Accordingly, he did not divide the country
amongst the seven princes who were his deputies. On the contrary, he
considered the mountainous periphery of the united land as its
natural defense line and the whole country as an important element of
the European equilibrium, as set forth by the treaty of Verdun in 843.
He was, therefore, anxious to put an end to the encroachments of the
little Moravian State and incorporated its borderland into Hungary in
902.
More fighting was needed before Arpad's strategic-political conception
was recognized and accepted by the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary's
dynamic western neighbour. This empire was naturally inclined to
expand eastward along the Danube valley. The most opportune time
for the realization of its ambitions seemed to arrive with the death of
Arpad, when huge armies were dispatched on both sides of the
Danube toward Hungary. They were, however, defeated right at the
border, in the marshy region of Pozsony (Pres-burg). As a result of this
decisive Hungarian victory, the Danubian provinces of present-day
Austria were annexed by Hungary as far as the river Enns. The whole
area remained under Hungarian rule until 933, when one of their
armies was defeated near Merseburg, and again in 955, near
Augsburg. After these events, Hungary's western borders were
gradually withdrawn to the line of the Lajta and Fischa rivers, where
they were stabilized for a thousand years and mutually recognized.
After that, there was no obstacle for the participation of Hungary
under Prince Géza at the meeting of Quedlinburg (973), called in by
the German emperor Otto the Great, to discuss the common security
problems of Central Europe.(61) The memory of Hungarian rule in
Moravia has been kept alive until our days by numerous village



names, built upon the Hungarian vocable, such as Uhersky and Uhr
Sitz (7 such names), or with other Hungarian words, such as Sallash
(= Szállás), the Hungarian for 'summer dwelling'. Similarly, many
Hungarian village-names survived in the Ostmark, out of which 25
include the word 'Hungarian', such as Ungar-Bach, Ungar-Stein, Ungar
Berg, Marca Hungarica; 103 others are compounded wirh Warte-,
Schiitze and 196 are built upon Ode, meaning uninhabited land, all of
them being situated within the former defense line, as explained by
Sándor Török (P 129 p. 22f).
The relations between Hungary and the Holy See of Rome were always
cordial, as soon as the Hungarians had put their heads under the
baptismal water, thereby irrevocably becoming loyal members of the
new European community. Pope Sylvestre II together with the German
emperor Otto III, recognized Hungary as a sovereign State. As a token,
he sent a golden royal crown to the ruler, who was solemnly
proclamed 'King of Hungary" on Christmas Day of the year 1001. The
Pope's gesture was repeated later by the emperor of Byzantium, who
also recognized the sovereign status of Hungary. The two crowns were
welded together into one and symbolized the great powers' alliance
with Hungary.
The Holy See of Rome also entrusted the kings of Hungary with the
mission to defend, spread and propagate Christianity in the
neighbouring pagan countries, especially in the Balkan Peninsula,
which was full of schismatics at that time. This resulted in Hungary's
expansion toward the Adriatic Sea by including Croatia (1097),
Dalmatia (1105) and Bosnia (1210). Thus, at the end of the XIth
century and the beginning of the XIIth, not only was Hungary's sovereign
status universally recognized, but the country had become a powerful
kingdom, ranking third in importance, right after the Holy Roman and
the Byzantine Empires. So, after a successful start, Christian Hungary
was heading toward the finest hour of its history.



Thus, the period of Ancient History of the Hungarians came to a close.
5. Epilogue: The fate of the lost Hungarian tribes
After the bulk of Hungarian-speaking peoples -Scythians, Huns, Avars
and Magyars- moved out of Eastern Europe and settled in Hungary,
this race ceased to play a significant political role in the oriental part
of the continent. Ethnographi-cally, however, it continued to be
present, since numerous large factions, which were separated from
the main body, stayed behind. The reason for such detachments were
varied. First it was the general custom that migrating steppe peoples
must leave an adequate number of warriors and woman folk behind to
stand guard over the ancient land, upon which they could fall back,
should the search for new and better grazing land fail. Then, internal
political tensions may also have caused secessions. Furthermore, and
most frequently, they were exposed to enemy attacks which could cut
off thousands of people and sweep them away from the main block.
Larger Hungarian break-away tribes stayed behind in the following
areas: 1. in Caucasia, 2. in the Volga region, 3. in Touran and 4. in
Moldavia.
1. In Caucasia, the detached Hungarian tribes were those living
between the Kuma and Terek rivers, on the northwestern side of the
Caspian Sea, called Kum-Magaria. Bear witness of their tribulations
eight papal edicts (Bulls) granted between 1245 and 1291. Their texts
have been published by László Bendefy (P 010). Among the other
contemporary documents relating to the problem we can mention an
inscription carved on stone, found in the Crimean Peninsula and
deciphered by the author. Finally, tradition also deserves to be
mentioned, preserved by both the Danubian Hungarians and the
successors of Hungarians in the East. Amongst the most important
historical studies devoted to this question are the works of L. Bendefy
(P Oil) and János Boros (P 018). But in spite of this apparent richness



of documentation on this topic, many questions remain unanswered,
so that our account is still conjectural on several points.
The Caucasian Hungarians were characterized by the fact that they
lacked comprehensive political organization for a long time, having
lived in chaotic conditions, each of their clans and tribes by
themselves, in as many mini-states. With the emergence of the Mongol
threat, however, the feeling prevailed amongst them, that for their
mutual defense and survival, they must unite their forces. Accordingly,
they all placed themselves under the authority of King Yeretany. This
king wanted, above anything else, to give his kingdom a Christian
organization. Therefore, he turned for help to the Holy See, asking for
catholic priests. These antecedents led to the emission of a first papal
edict by John XXII, on behalf of the "most eminent Prince Yeretany."
We read the following passage in the said edict: "Greetings to our son
Yeretany and other Christian Hungarians (in Caucasia)... We have
understood that thou, my son Yeretany, who art a descendant from the
earliest Catholic kings of Hungary, wanted to receive, together with
other Christians of the said region... a Catholic missionary (doctorem
Catholicum desiratis habere>.)." The first "Catholic Doctor" arrived at
Magyar-on-the-Kuma in the person of Bishop Thaddeus (1331-1334).
He was followed by seven others, the last one holding office from
1366 to 1377. It is not known what became thereafter of Yeretany, but
his epitaph, found in the Crimea suggests, that he was himself a priest
and fled westwards, before the Mongol invasion. His inscription
actually reads thus: "Here is kept, by the Armenian monks, the holy
treasure of Yeretany, an Iranian lord and prince of the Don-bank. (This
treasure) consists of two church-cans. Great holiness was the
distinctive mark of this 'living God'." The dreaded onslaught of the
Mongol armies materialized in 1395/96, when the city of Magyar was
destroyed and the Kuma-Terek plain incorporated into the Kiptchak
Turk empire as a province. The few surviving Magyars then retreated



into the mountains and F. Nansen, the Norvégián explorer, was the last
European who spoke to their descendants in 1925.
2. The second and by far the largest Hungarian-speaking ethnic group,
that of the Volga Hungarians was detached from the main body
somewhere to the north of the Caspian sea in the Vlth century
following the attacks of the Turks, and was pushed northwards along
the river Volga. They were met be the imperial ambassador
Zemarchus, who talked with the "Prince of the Hungarians, who
reigned by the grace of Dizabuli khan" (On-gororum dux qui illic ex
auctoritate Dizabuli impérium habebat" (P 092 p. 93 f.). They were
then lost from sight and had no contact with any other Hungarian
group for about 600 years. They were rediscovered quasi accidentally
in 1236 by zealous Dominicans (Black Friars), who originally wanted
to find the Caucasian Hungarians, for they wanted to convert them to
the Christian faith. Four missionaries started on this venture in 1235,
via Constantinople. However, when they arrived at the city of Matrica
(the present Taman), at the entrance of the Maeotis (now Sea of
Azov), they altered their itinerary for an unknown reason and instead
of continuing eastwards, they turned directly to the north, journeying
along the west bank of the Volga. Finally, Friar Julian, the only
surviving priest, succeeded in finding a large Hungarian tribal group
"near the Great River Ethyl."
There is a report on this unique journey, written in the XHIth century
and submitted to the Holy See of Rome, where it is kept in the Record
Office. Its text is published in the collection of medieval writings
edited by Imre Szentpétery and is currently known as the "Richardus
report" (P 120 II pp. 535-542). This report describes the dramatic
encounter thus: "He (Friar Julian) found them near the great river
Ethyl ( = Volga). When they learned that he was a Christian
Hungarian, they were greatly pleased about his coming. He was
shown their houses and cottages and was pressed with questions



about the king and the realm of Christian Hungarians. To everything
he told them, about faith and other things, they listened attentively,
because their language was entirely Hungarian and they understood
him and he them (quia omnino habent Hungaricum idioma et intellige
bant eum et ipse eos'•)." Julianus then promptly returned to Hungary
to impart his important discovery to his brethren at home. In the next
year (1237), Julianus undertook a second journey to the Volga, but
was unable to reach the Ungarian settlement because the Mongolian
armies were already on the way to make new conquests. In that very
year, Hungary at the Volga had been destroyed, and the nation's ethnic
identity abolished for ever. The surviving individual Magyars were
scattered all around within a radius of about 200km, on the Volga
Heights, around the Pensa and Sura rivers, with some settlements at
Saratov, Tambov and Riazan. Today, their memory is kept alive by a
great number of place-names which include the Magyar name. The
local inhabitants remember that they have Hungarian blood in their
veins, but do not speak Hungarian any more; Turkish and/or Russian
being their language (P 019 p. 229 f.).
3. The Touranian Hungarians always lived somewhat apart from the
other Near Eastern Hungarians, to the east of the Caspian Sea, around
the Aral Sea and in the Oxus valley. In Hungarian chronicles, this is
the region which probably appears under the name of Magoria. This
ethnic group first attracted the attention of our historians in the last
century, when Kristóf Lukácsy devoted a fine work (P 092) to them in
1870. More recently, after World War II, the same area came once
again into the forefront of research, thanks to the insistence of Erik
Molnár, whose example was followed by Tibor Tóth, P.-T. Veres and Pál
Lipták, who all underscored the close connections of the Ura-lian
Hungarians with the Touranians. But it is Antal Bartha who deserves
the credit for having discovered the earliest role of the Touranians,
who were responsible for the civilization of the local population of the



Ural region and that of Western Siberia, in the Und millenium B. C.
The surviving traces of the lost Touranian Hungarians were also
carefully recorded (Kath. Magyarok Vasárnapja, January 12,1969;
Kanadai Magyarság, November 23,1968; Sorsunk, Sidney, February
13, 1960, etc.) and the villages, with 'Madiar' names, noted.
A major faction of Touranian Hungarians seem to have been swept far
away, towards southeastern Asia, into what is today New-Zealand,
where they continue to call themselves Maori (<Ma-Ur-i), i.e. Magyar.
Their existence has been discovered by F. A. Uxbond (alias Wilhelm
von Hevesy) in his sensational book, published in English in 1928 (P
130). This publication lists innumerable evidence to prove that the
Maori are closely related to the European Hungarians, both racially
and culturally. The Maori of to-day are highly civilized, but almost
entirely absorbed into their English-speaking surroundings. The
mystery of the origin of this ethnic faction has not yet been fully
elucidated, which is perhaps connected with the expansion of the
Kushan Empire.
4. Our record would not be complete without mentioning the break
away Hungarian group of Tchangos, now living in Moldavia, on the
other side of the Carpathians, near the rivers Tatros and Sereth,
numbering altogether 170,000 souls. The capital city of Moldavia is
Yassy, the Hungarian Jász-Város 'City of the Yazigues'. Their full story
is related in a recently published 1520-pages monumental
sociographic study, by Pál-Péter Domokos (P 043). The colony started
at the beginning of the Christian era, with a faction of Yazigues that
did not continue its journey into Hungary for reasons unknown to us,
but stayed behind, breaking all relations with their brethren who had
entered Hungary and settled there. The Yazigue colony of Moldavia
later received additional Hungarians, when the warlike Cuman-Turks
set up a principality in Moldavia, then Cumania. To protect Hungary
against the harassments of this pagan people, King András II (1205



1235) placed border-guards on both sides of the Carpathians, at
several points. As a further step toward their pacification, the
archbishop of Esztergom/Hungary, established missionaries in
Cumania, who converted the people to Christianity. The first bishop
had been installed at Milkó in 1227 and was followed by a new influx
of Magyars. Until 1410, five Hungarian bishoprics were erected. An
official census, carried out in the middle of the XVth century, found a
total population of 47,167 in Moldavia. Out of that number, over
20,000 were Catholic Hungarians. On the eve of World War II, the
Tchango-Magyars boasted 60 villages in the Tatros valley and 160
along the Sereth river.
When the northern corner of Moldavia, the district called Bukovina,
was annexed by the Aus-tro-Hungarian Monarchy, general András
Hadik transferred some Moldavian Hungarians into that district. Their
descendants, numbering 24,000 souls, were rapatriated into mother
land Hungary, during the second World War. All the other Tchango
Magyars continue to stay in the land, and are deprived of all cultural
facilities in their own language, not even having elementary
instruction, despite the fact that they are the native people of the land,
who settled there well before the arrival of the first Rumanians in the
XHIth century.
To sum up the sad history of the lost Hungarian tribes, we may say
that ethnographic factions, large or small, which broke away in Eastern
Europe from the main body of Hungarians, were able to retain their
identity for several centuries but most of them disappeared in the great
politico-military upheaval which was brought about by the Mongol
invasion in the XIIIth century.

1. We have reverted to the Aryan term, following the practice of many
scientists, who prefer it because its meaning is 'Men' (Wiro, Vir, Ar, Ur)
in most of the European languages (cf. P 130 p. 115).
2. The double racial origin of the Hungarians is first mentioned in the
Lacin language work of the sharp-eyed historian Deseritzky who said:
"Hunnos Magoresque gentem robustissimam et populosissimam
partim ex Japhet per Magog, partim ex Cham per Chus turn vero
Nemrothum fuisse propagatam et in unum coaluisse" (P 092 p. 79).
3. The head-shape is indicated by the cephalic index (CI). It is given in
percentage ratio (100) with the skull-width (W) and its greatest
length (L), from front to back, seen from above the head: CI= 100 X
(W:L). When its CI is 80.00 or more, the cranium is round, short or
brachy-cephalic. When CI is 75.00 or less, the cranium is long or
dolychocephalic. Between these two ranges are the meso-cephalic or
medium-headed elements.
4. E. Pittard: «Il me semble de plus en plus évident que les invasions
avares et magyares, qui apparaissent de beaucoup comme les plus
importantes, ne sont que deux
5. E. Pittard noticed the strong concentration of shortheaded Aryans
in the Ancient Near-East. He said: "En Asie, par exemple, parmi les
peuples divers que l'on a appelés les Aryens, et qui ont laissé le
souvenir de grandes civilisations, il y a beaucoup de brachycéphales,
d'Aryen brachycéphales" (P 103 p. 29).
6. It is important to keep in mind that, when our historical sources
mention the "dark" complexion of Kush, they do not always use this
word in a literal sense as 'black', but rather as opposed to white.
Further, the Kush must not be confused with Negroes, who are either



a distinct race, or a product of the jungle. Schuré insists upon this and
says: «Il faut en chercher le type supérieur non pas dans le Nègre
dégénéré, mais dans l'Abyssinien et le Nubien, en qui se conserve le
moule de cette race parvenue à son apogée» (P 114 p. 42).
7. In the first millenium A.D., almost every Eastern-Euro-pean nation
had some brownish-darkish complexioned ethnie elements in their
physical make-up. There were white and dark Huns, white and dark
Bulgars, white and dark Ugors, white and dark Chasars. It is
surprising that this all-important historical fact escaped the attention
of scientists, who persisted in believing that the adjectives White and
Dark, when employed in historical sources, in connection with ethnic
names, would signify the basic points: East and West, i.e. the
geographic position of the respective peoples. This is, of course, a
misinterpretation.
8. Chronicler Simon de Kéza accurately reflects the general feeling of
Hungarians against the dark coloured population by saying: "Gentes
siquidem in eadem (i.e. in Scythia) procreate otia complectuntur,
vanitatibus de-dite, nature dedignantis actibus venereis intendentes,
rapiñas amant, generaliter colore plus nigre quam albe" (P 120 I p.
252).
9. Former linguists and historians were inclined to consider the Kush
population as of Old Turkish extraction. It was, however, impossible to
find a fitting Turkish branch, or to determine the specific geographic
area where contacts between Hungarians and Turks might have taken
place. Above all, the beginning of the Kush-Hungarian relations
antedates the existence of any Turkish people. Therefore, the idea of
early Turkish-Hungarian connections had to be abandoned (see Prof.
Benko in P 009 p. 50).
10. The same opinion was expressed in a most recent German



language publication by Ferenc Kemény: "(Dass) das Ungarische
einerseits allen eurasischen Sprachen als Grundlage gedient hat,
andererseits eine echte Ursprache ist, deren Ursprung aus dem
heutigen Bestand derselben eindeutig erklaert werden kann (P 078 p.
115; see ibiden pp. 50, 61).
11. That Hungarian is an Aryan tongue par excellence, was stated
time and again by a number of linguists; most emphatically be Kristóf
Lukácsy, who said this: "When I say that Hungarian belongs to the
Aryan class of languages, I am summarizing the results of my
investigations of several years, conducted in the field of Hungarian
linguistics and antiquities" (P 092 p. 199).
12. "Aryan is the terminus technicus describing one of the great
language-groups extending from India to Europe" (P 038; see also
P133 and P 132). - Formerly, by mistake, the European languages
were collectively classified as Aryan. But their names do not include
the distinctive vocable Ari. Their kinship is based only upon the word
stock present in their substratum. — For the Aryan term, see also P
091 pp. 27-30; and Encycl. Britannica, ed. 1947, t. II p. 494.
13. "Ihm (Illitch-Switytch) war es gelungen, das System der
Lautentsprechungen zwischen den indoeuropäischen, den uralischen,
den altaischen... der khartweli-schen, den hamito-semitischen und
den dravidischen Sprachen zu erkennen. Diese Lautentsprechungen
beziehen sich auf Hunderte von Wortwurzeln einer eura-sischen
Ursprache deren man die Bezeichnung 'nostra-tisch' oder 'boreisch'
gab, — writes Dolgopolski in his German language account (P 042).
— See also the Hungarian complement to this study by Gy. Hary in
Valóság (Budapest, October 1976, p. 177). - Dolgopolski continues
thus: "Als Urheimat der boreischen Sprache, kommt nach allem, was
wir heute wissen, der Raum von Indien, und von Kaukasien bis zum
Persischen Golf, in Frage." - "Die boreische Sprachgemeinschaft muss



demnach in der mittleren Steinzeit, vor Beginn der Jungsteinzeit,
bestanden haben..." (P 042).
14. «Le nom du peuple Aryen reste jusqu'à présent sans explication
certaine» (P 091 p. 75).
15. Bird-headed statuettes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia
already from the time of the Flood (P 006 I p. 56). In Hungary too,
bird-headed bone-sticks have been found on several sites (P 050 p.
258).
16. Most of the Oriental place - and ethnic names with a Hungarian
meaning have been collected from the following five publications: P
013; P 021; P 024; P 044; and P 085. Some others were found in the
works of Herodotus, Dauzat, Uxbond, Saks, etc.
17. Toppeltinus: "...etiamnum vocantur Magori. Ingens populus et ipsi
armorum gloria inclytum regnum possi-dent" (P 092 pp. 98, 203).
18. L.A. Waddell comments Barat-Varsha thus: "The Land of the Barats
(Barat Varsha) a name synonymous with 'Barat Ana' or 'Land of the
Barats', which I have proved to be the original form of the name 'Brit
Ain' as given to Albion about 1100 B.C. by... the same Aryan race of
Barats... who civilized India and the Ganges valley" (P 132 bis p. 10);
see also the entry under 'Barata Varsha' in P 044).
19. "They called it /Egypt/ the land of Mezor ( = Magyar) and the
land of Cham / = Kush/ from their two ancestors, which the Greek
rendered Mesora and Chamia" (P 023 p. 298). — The same idea is
expressed in the following quotation "Throughout the early dynastic
period and the Old Kingdom /of Egypt/ Set (= the dark ruler ) and
Horus (the Aryan ruler) are represented as the two patron-deities of
the Monarchy" (John Van Saters, The Hyksos, London 1966 p. 98).



20. The transliteration of carved signs into Roman characters is
usually done 1. with capital letters for the graphically expressed
sounds; and 2. with small characters for the sounds supplied by the
decipherer. And 3. in our transliterations a dot is inserted between the
elements of every combined sound-sign. 4. The omitted consonants or
words are given in parentheses (), while 5. the broken-off and missing
signs are in brackets /.../.
21. The word Pogány 'Pagan' originates from the Latin Pagus 'Village'
and Paganus 'Villager', signifying 'People living in the countryside.' In
the Middle Ages, the same word was, however, used in a pejorative
sense to say 'uneducated, backward, despicable', especially when
speaking of non-Christian people. The alternative word for Pagan is
Heathen. It is probably derived from the Old Hungarian word Héth
'Seven', a shortened from of the expression 'Follower of the Seven
Great Gods.'
22. Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of the cruel
treatment King St. Stephen inflicted upon Thonuzoba who "stubbornly
adhering to his beliefs, was unwilling to become a Christian, and was
buried alive with his wife" (P 120 I p. 117). A similar cruel
punishment was imposed upon a woman, Raski by name, who was
prominent in a heathen uprising: "(She) was captured by the very
Christian King Béla and confined in prison until she ate her own feet,
and also died in the same place" (P 120 I p. 398). Persecutions of
adherents to the old faith continued until about the middle of the
XHIth century, the last dreaded inquisitor having been Johannes
Theuthon (+1252), commissioner of the Holy See to several Central
European states (P 047).
23. King Saint Stephen mentions in his gift-charter granted to the
nuns of Veszprém-Valley: "Ibi stat meta lapidea, que volgo Baluan
vocatur," "There stands a boundary-stone, called Idol by the local



population." ― Similarly, King András I ordered in his edict of 1047:
"Falsos deos abrogare et Simulacra demoliri", "to suppress the false
gods and to destroy the idols" (P 082 p. 367).
24. A witness who attended a meeting of wise-men, testified before
the Christian inquisitor by saying: "Wiseman Bansa climbed to the top
of a high ladder, stayed there for a while, chatting with God and, back
on earth, he foretold the future to his audience" (P 047 p. 56).
25. "Each time a Pharaoh was conceived, Ra was said to have returned
to earth to espouse the queen' (P 045 p. 50).
26. The corresponding passage by Anonymus reads thus: "matri eius
pregnanti per sompnium apparuit divina visio in forma Asturis que
quasi veniens earn gravidavit et innotuit ei quod de utero eius
egrederetur torrens et de limbis eius reges gloriosi propagarentur" (P
120 I p. 38).
27. "erat enim ipse Almus facie decorus sed niger, nigros habebat
oculos sed magnos, statura longus et gracilis, manus vero habebat
grossas et digitos prolixos" (P 120 I p. 38).
28. The grandson of Prince Arpad, Taksony, was of white complexion,
while Arpad's great-grandson took after him: "He had beautiful big
eyes and soft dark hair". Certain kings of the dynasty were of very
high stature, as, for example, St. Stephen, King András I, St. Ladislas
and King Béla III.
29. Prof. Gardiner states that the Egyptian Arpad may have been
"perhaps the first to become ruler upon earth over the autochthonous
Egyptians, after whom followed Osiris and the Horus" (P 052 p.
*110).
30. See the following references: P 052 I pp. *14 - *19, "103 and



*108; and P 026 II 94 - 100, 109, 153 and 374. -If the Sumerian name
for Earth was also Pat, Pot, the Sumerian ruler's title Pat-Esi (=H. Föld
Őse) also meant 'Land Ancestor' or 'Land Lord'.
31. Many rulers of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty had throne-names
with a clear Oriental meaning, and this explains why certain names
appear so often, like István (five times) and Béla (four times). In the
Old Hungarian spelling István or Están was the word for Isten 'God'.
Béla (in O.H. Bala, Baal, Bika) was the Syrian name for Great-God.
They were used in an abridged form, all bearing testimony that their
wearers were 'Living Gods', i.e. Gods on Earth, exactly as was the
practice in the Ancient Orient.
32. Babylon was surrounded by seven walls; the Mesopotamian
Ziggurat had seven floors; Mesopotamian noblemen wore seven
ruffled kilts; Egypt had seven great gods; the Egyptian Heaven had
seven divisions; the Hittite Empire (the Biblical Héth) started with the
fusion of seven lands; the Etruscan nation began with the federation
of seven cities; Rome was built on seven hills; etc. etc.
33. According to Prof. Áldásy, the double-cross cannot be considered
an apostolic cross; this latter was always a single cross (P 001 p. 63).
Thus, he indirectly admits the pre-Christian origin of this important
symbol.
34. The best edition of the medieval national chronicles is that of
Emericus Szentpétery, former professor at Budapest University (F 120
I-II).
35. "Et primus rex Scythiae fuit Magog filius Japhet, et gens ilia a
Magog rege vocata est Moger", ― writes Anonymus (P 120 I p. 35).
36. On these conflicting views see, particularly, the Chroni-con Pictum
(P 120 I pp. 243-250, and the Hungarian translation: P 053 pp. 35



37).
37. No Hungarian historian has taken notice until now that Egyptian
literature also know of a hunting hero, Onuris by name (like the
Hungarian Hunor), who had a mate called Mehit, 'lioness'. See the
somewhat confused passage in P 032 p. 227, which reads: "His
(Onuris') cult figure was a man wearing a long skirt, his feet poised
well apart, to enable him to aim a spear downwards at some
monstrous foe. His worship was centred in Thinis, a district which also
included Abydos." The Coffin Texts, III 334 j. are given as reference.
38. The original wording is thus: 'Ubi propter intemperiem illius zonae
sunt serpentes diversi generis, ranae velut porci, basilisci, et plura
animalia toxicata; tigris et unicornis ibi generantur." Where gold,
silver and pearls are also to be found (P 120 I p. 253. See also P 130
p. 164, where another location is suggested).
39. This is the opinion of many international authorities, like C.
Dawson who writes this: "It is certainly in the Danubian region that
we find (in Europe) the most complete and typical example of any
early peasant culture" (P 039 p. 53). And H. T. Waterbolk: "(Toward
3000 B.C.), the Hungarian Plain was a dominant centre which had
incorporated all the major achievements of the nuclear area in the
Near East and which had added to these an adaptation to the
European deciduous forest" (P 134).
40. for the westward diffusion of the Hungarian Neolithic and Bronze
Age civilizations see, in addition to the quoted references in the text,
in particular P 039 pp. 51 and 169.
41. In the light of the etymology given there, we have to abandon the
fantastic explanation of the Greek writers of the past, who believed
that the Italian Siculi were governed by One-Eyed Giants, interpreting
the Syc-Lo-Pe expression as being the Greek word Cyclops.



42. Thukydides relates that "the country owes its name of Italy to
Italus, a king of Sicel, so called." Now, Ital, as a Hungarian word,
means a 'drink', and Italos somebody 'fond of alcoholic drink'. The
explanation seems to be a fitting one, because the early Sicels are said
to have been fond of wine, which they drank in the Scythian fashion,
i.e. unmixed with water (P 067 Book VI cap. 84 and Book I cap. 106).
― Incidentally, the Greek name of Sungod, Apollo, is, in their
language, a Hungarian loan-word, made up with Pe + Ló, and the
prefixed definitive article A, whence A Pe-Lo, contracted into Apollo,
literally means 'The Chief Horse'.
43. Prof. Hood is reluctant to see actual writing upon the tablets: "But
do the Tartaria ( = Tatárlaka) tablets actually bear writing? Probably
not... It seems quite possible that they were merely an
uncomprehending imitation of more civilized peoples' written
records... a pretense by some illiterate barbarian to command the
magic embodied in an art he had witnessed but did not understand"
(P 068).
44. The calendar was a precious instrument in the hands of every
farming community of the Antiquity. It enabled the peasants to know
the most appropriate time to carry out certain important tasks, such as
plowing and sowing in particular and it was also useful for the timing
of religious festivals.
45. In Atlantic Europe, the observation of the various seasonal
positions of the Sun, in reference to the zodiacal star-clusters, was
made with the help of heavy megalith-ic structures (e.g. Stonehenge).
In the Danubian region, the more advanced microlithic structure
prevailed. This is the significant difference between the two halves of
Europe, although this has never been pointed out until now.
46. The step-by-step explanation of the inscription is thus: in the



second compartment we can distinguish the rising Sun, in Hungarian
A Nap. On its right side, the contours of a mouse (H.: Az Egér) are
visible, with its thin, long tail. The picture of this animal is here
because it is homophonous with the expression Az Égre, 'to the sky'.
So, the thus far deciphered words say this: A Nap az Égre 'The Sun to
the sky'. After that, we read the signs placed in the left and right
columns, saying: the cross sign iT, the crab A RÁK, followed by a sign
for the sound-group KUR/KOR, and finally the word for donkey IÁ. In
modern Hungarian: Itt a rákkor jö 'Comes at this spot in the Cancer
constellation'. The directive continues in the third compartment thus:
aN-aP Je-Le aR-áK öV-Be... 'The day's symbol in the Cancer zone is...
The complete message in better English reads: 'Here (at Tatárlaka) the
Sun appears on the horizon in the Cancer constellation on the day of...
― The homophony existing between 'Sky God' (Az Égúr) and the
mouse (Az Egér) was probably the origin of the never-explained
Oriental custom of keeping white mice in Sun-temples, as was the
case in Babylon and Egypt. The presence of these small animals was a
mean amongst a hundred others, to remind the believers that God
may hide himself in any of his creatures to watch over their behaviour.
47. «La science considére aujourd'hui que les Celtes ne constituent pas
une race, dans le sens propre du terme mais ont toujours été un
groupe de peuples, formánt un agrégat de types du point de vue
anthropologique» (P 057 p. 10; and see P 070 I p. X and P 132 p.
128).
48. The thesis of the linguistic unity of Celtic Europe is stressed by
almost every author, as for example P 037 p. 12; P 057 pp. 10-12; P
070 I pp. 49, 51. The hundred million Celts are mentioned in the
publication P 057 p. 11.
49. Henri Hubert consoles himself by saying: «Rien d'étonnant que ces
noms soient difficile á expliquer et que leur sens etymologique se soit



évanoui» (P 070 I p. 27 f.).
50. "Erat enim rex Ethele colore teter, oculis nigris et furiosis, pectore
lato, elatus incessu, statura brevis, barbam prolixam gum Hunnis
deferebat" (P 120 I p. 151).
51. Author Agathias writing about the Hunnorum Gens says this: "Hi
vero omnes communiter Scythae et Hunni vocabantur, privátim
autem, secundum nationes alii aliter ex patria cuique et usita
appellatione nominaban-tur", quoted by P 092 p. 130.
52. "Mensa erat tota aurea, vasa etiam coquinaria aurea erant",
records Simon de Kéza (P 120 I p. 262).
53. Clenodia aurea que a tempore regis Ungariae Attila et ab aliis
successoribus suis usque nunc in Ungaria fuerant conservata" (P 099
p. 187 f.).
54. It should be noted, once again, that the ancient royal Egyptian
symbols also included the bird, the whip and the bee.
55. Incidentally, ancient Egyptian kings had the same custom: "The
warrior kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties were pleased when
the court scribes related in commemorative inscriptions how their
lords raged and roared like lions as they mounted their chariots and
set out to crush the foolish enemy" (P 026 I p. 25 f.)
56. "Sie besassen keine Sprache, sondern stiessen kurze, rauhe Laute
aus, wie Tiere auf der Flucht" (P 113 p. 17).
57. "Sie sind treuer and harter als die Germanen, sie kennen nichts als
den König" (P 113 p. 130).
58. "Der Name Attila ist heute zweifelsfrei als Germanisch 'Váterchen'
erkannt", Die Presse, Stuttgart, 20, May 1975.



59. The Swiss anthropologist E. Pittard was one of the first scientists
to suspect the close affinity of the early inhabitants of Hungary. He
said: «I1 est probable, á voir les caractéres morphologiques des
habitants de la Hongrie, que parmi les peuples qui arrivaient de l'Est,
il y en avait plusieurs qui étaient puisés aux mémes fonds ethniques
que les Magyars eux-mémes» (P 103 p. 341).
60. Several examples can be listed to prove that Horse (Lau) was used
to say Ra, the Sungod. In the Zagros mountains, to the east of
Mesopotamia, there was a small country called Lauristan (<H.: Ló-Ur
Isten), 'Land placed under the protection of the Horse-Lordgod' i.e.
Sungod. It was the unique task of the Scythians who lived in that
country to raise horses for the Persian armies. Their popular art was
also overladen with horse representations. — Another example: The
Armenian bishop, Israyel, who travelled into the land of the Huns and
described their beliefs, said this: "The Huns worshipped their highest
divinity in the form of a giant warrior, mounted on horseback" (P 081
p. 65). - The Hungarian AU sound usually changes into 0, as in the
city-name of Iglau, which is in modern Hungarian, Igló.
61. Originally, the eastern border lands of Germany (the future
Austria) were a creation of Frankish rulers. They were re-established
later, as duchies of Carinthia (976), Carniola (1040), Styria (1055)
and Ostmark (1156).

The Early Hungarians - THE SCYTHIAN HUNGARIANS

THE SCYTHIAN HUNGARIANS
1. Their origin and civilization
The history of the Scythians is so complicated and forms such a
tangled skein of varied problems — says A. L. Mongait — that, in spite
of abundant sources for its study, "the Scythian problem remains an
intransigent subject, that is still far from settled" (P 097 bis p. 153). At
one time the Scythians are said to be Indo-Europeans, on the basis of
the similitude of their language; at another, they are considered Huns,
with whom they shared their cultural features. Elsewhere, it is
maintained that they belonged to the Hungarian-speaking group of
peoples (Uralo-Altaians), with whom they were closely linked
throughout their history, both in the Orient and the Occident. All these
opinions circulate freely, since nobody has, as yet, correctly analysed
the Scythian tongue, nor deciphered any of their written messages.
What is definitely known about the Scythians, however, is that they
did not all live in a single political structure, but were broken up into
several political entities, with as many individual ethnic
denominations. The lack of political unity of the Scythians could not,
however, conceal their close affinities: they all spoke the same
language, had the same solar cult, the same civilization and "were linked
by some sort of racial tie" (P 123 p. 42).
Their original homeland, or more precisely, the geographic area where



history first detected them, was the northern hinterland of
Mesopotamia and Syria. From these regions they were gradually
squeezed out by the continuous razzias of the Assyrians, a Semitic
population swarming out from the nearby deserts. They subjected the
whole Scythian Old Fatherland to their iron rule during the VIIIth
century B.C. The destruction of the Kingdom of Arpad, on the great
bend of the Euphrates, in 743 B.C. and the capture of the City7State
of Karkemish in 717 B.C. were the final stage of Semitic expansion to
the North. The Sythian tribes, driven out of their old homes, first
concentrated along the Araxes and Kura rivers, in the swampy region
of thousands of islands. Thereafter they gradually occupied the
higher-lying Terek and Kuban regions, and finally took possession of
the large tract of land above the Caucasus, up to the elbow of the
Volga.
When they were at the zenith of their history, in the first millenium
B.C., Scythian kings ruled over the immense natural grassland
stretching from the Carpathians and the Lower Danube eastward,
above the Black sea, to the Caucasian mountains (European Scythia)
and the Caspian sea, including the Touranian Plain and the Oxus
valley (Asiatic Scythia). In addition, detachments of Scythians
occupied other farflung regions, such as northwest India and the
eastern Asian section of the steppe, extending up to the Chinese
borders.
Ruling over such an extensive territory was only possible thanks to the
large scale use of the riding horse, which allowed rapid communication
between widely separated areas. This innovation explains why the
Scythians became the first political organizers in the history of the
entire Eurasian steppe. Prior to the use of riding horses, greater
political units could be established in large river valleys only, where
boats fulfilled the same role, as in the Nile valley and also in the
Euphrates and Indus valleys.



It was between 750 B.C. and 500 B.C. that the individuality of the
Scythians emerged. They had then a mixed economy: some
agriculture, large scale stock-raising, (in which horse-breeding was
predominant) and also mining and metal working. They lived under
kings and princes whose principal identifying emblem was the golden
stag medal. They always moved around on horseback and wore close
fitting pantalons. Their most important arm was a longrange bow,
having arrows fitted with triangular metal heads. Under the impact of
the new equestrial armies, the Scythians evolved a peculiar defense
system, consisting of earthworks. Its purpose was to render any sudden
mounted attack against human settlements impossible. The system
included a fortified rampart or dike with a deep and wide ditch, filled
with water on its outside. The rampart was then planted with thorny
hedges, shrubs and trees. These fences extended for hundreds of miles
and surrounded thousands of acres of soil as well, to keep the
livestock protected against predators. This Scythian military strategy
set the pattern for the entire steppe-population and was to remain
unchanged for centuries to come.
2. Scythians in Hungary
Owing to the growing pressure of the Sarmatians, another mounted
steppe people, the European Scythians slowly drifted westward. They
percolated through the Carpathians, and gradually brought the Great
Hungarian Lowland, the westernmost fringe of the great Eurasian
natural grassland, under their control. They soon transported hereto
their royal seat and thus Hungary became the center of Scythian rule.
The first Scythian group reached Hungary around 550 B.C. They were
called Agathyrsi and have established campsites in the Upper Maros
region. They were followed by other groups, occupying many places
on the Great Plain, the Transylvanian plateau and in the Bükk and
Mátra area. The Scythians were the first Danubian people to establish
effective rule over the entire population of Hungary. Thus, the



Carpatho-Danubian basin was first unified politically by them. During
their rule in Hungary (c. 500 B.C. - 350 B.C.), the Scythians came into
contact with the aboriginal Magyar population on a large scale,
through intermarriage. Following this historical process, all the
Magyar speaking population of the Danube basin began to call
themselves "Scythians", an appellation that strongly influenced the
view of the medieval chroniclers, who considered the Magyars as a
Gens Scythica. The long stay in Hungary of the Scythian ruling clan is
evidenced by the most beautiful Scythian treasure ever found,
consisting of two gold stags, discovered at Tápió-Szent-Márton and at
Zöld-Halom-Puszta respectively (Fig. 30-31).

The last major detachment of Scythians entered the land under the
general name of Sarmati (Sarmatians). They are, however, most
frequently mentioned by their clan-names, as Alani, Yazigues and
Roxolani. The Yazigues settled in Hungary in A.D. 20, and occupied
the pasture-land between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, where they
erected strong fortifications. Thanks to their inaccessible territory, they
could preserve their autonomous rule during the Roman occupation of
Pannónia and Dacia. They lost their ethnic identity during the Hun



period, but a large district and a county still retain their name.
The presence of Scythians in Hungary is superbly documented by the
archaeological remains of their civilization: grave-mounds and colossal
defence installations. The grave-mounds or barrows resulted from the
earth they heaped up upon the tombs of their defunct leaders, kings
or princes. Grave-mound in Hungarian is Sir-Halom or simply Halom.
This term forms part of several dozens of old place-names all over the
country, such as Herceg-Halom, 'Prince's Mound'; Zöld-Halom-Puszta
'Green Mound on the Steppe' (there are four such names), in one of
them a precious gold stag-medal was found, proving that the mound
is really a princely one; Sas-Halom 'Eagle's Mound'; Hegyes-Halom
'Pointed Mound' (two such names); Száz-Halom 'Hundred Mounds'
(where the victims of a huge battle have been buried in the Hunnic
times). Until 1939, 85 Scythian burial sites were excavated in
Hungary, a testimony of the numerous Scythians who were living
there.
The innumerable remains of the former Scythian defense system
allowed the archaeologists to reconstruct its whole extension. The
main line, often in triple rows, started at the Danube elbow at Vác and
proceeded eastwards along the northern edge of the Great Plain
through Eger and Tokaj to Nyíregyháza. At that point it turned
southwards, by-passed Szatmár, Nagyvárad, Gyula and Versec, and at
that level, it reached the Danube again. At certain strategically
important points, such as at Sopron on the west, and the region of
Diósgyőr in the northeast, more elaborate embankments were
constructed. Secondary or disconnected ditches existed near rivers at
crossings and fords (Garam, Vág, Maros, Temes, Olt), and in mountain
passes as well. The rectangular rich land between the Danube and the
Tisza to the south was protected by triple lines on its open northern
side. The total length of the embankments and ditches in Hungary
exceeded 1700 km, while the enclosed and protected area measured



62,000 km2. The building of these defence lines required the removal
of 20,000,000 m3 of earth (P 084 and P 102). The technical terms for
the various parts of the defence installations were the following: the
general name of earthen stronghold was Föld-Vár, the ditch was Árok',
the rampart or embankment was Gát; the fence or hedge on top of the
embankment Sövény, the enclosure or area surrounded with
entrenchment was Sánc or Udvar. These technical terms occur by the
dozens in Old Hungarian place-names; one has only to open the
Directory of Hungary's place-names to be convinced about this. We
have such names as Duna-Földvár, Árok Szállás, Gát-Falva, Sövény
Háza, Sánc, Sánci-Puszta, Sánc-Pataka, Udvar-Hely, etc.
When was this system built and who were its builders? It is obvious
that the whole system was not erected at one time. Certain sections
were, in all probability, completed during the last centuries of the first
millenium B.C., toward the end of Scythian domination, when their
rule was threatened. Other parts were built by the Sarmatians, the
successors of the Scythians proper, between 250 and 300 A.D.
Furthermore, the work was continued during the Hun period as well.
Sometimes the ditches' names may give a clue to this question, which
are in English: 'Ditch of the Giants', 'Ditch of the Devil', 'Ditch of the
Dark Men' (i.e. Csörsz Árka, Csörsz meaning 'Dark' in the local
parlance). Other names point to a younger period, such as 'Ditch of
the Huns', 'Road of Attila', 'Ditch of the Avars' and 'Roman
Embankments'.
To erect so many mounds, and build such gigantic earthen
strongholds, it was necessary to have a strong central authority,
unified planning, constant maintenance work and, above all, a great
number of people for manual work. It follows that not a "few"
Scythians had come to live in Hungary, as was earlier erroneously
supposed, but "many": ordinary people, as well as kings and princes.



3. The language of the European Scythians
Ancient authors, such as Herodotus, Strabo, Plinius, Jordanes and
others agree that all Scythian people spoke the same language, and
modern scythologists have also accepted this view almost
unanimously. The controversy begins with the next question, viz. what
was this language and with which language group was it affiliated? In
trying to solve this mystery, we will examine, in turn, common
Scythian words recorded by foreign authors, then Scythian ethnic and
personal names, and finally Scythian symbols and other written
evidence.
One of our principal sources is, of course, Herodotus who had such a
keen interest in the Scythian way of life that he undertook the
tiresome journey to Olbia on the Black Sea shore to find out more
about it. He noted that every Scythian carried an inward curving
sharp knife strapped to his boot, and called "A Cina Kesh". In present
graphic form, this expression would be A csizma kés (The Boot Knife),
whose most important element Kesh, 'Knife' is Kés in Hungarian as
well. Herodotus also relates that one of the Scythian names for
Sungod was Oetos-Ur-Us, which is also a Hungarian name
Ötös Ur-Ös 'Number 5 Divinity', five being the sacred number of the
Sungod, as already mentioned. The Master also noticed that Upper
Scythia is often snow-covered in winter, for which reason the soil is
concealed from view for months. And he adds that the Scythians call
the snow-flakes 'feathers'. Similarly, in Hungarian the same word Pihe
is used for both the fine feathers and the light snow-flakes.
The father of historiography was charmed with all that he had learned
about the principal Scythian river, the Dnieper, then called Danaber,
something like Tanya Bor 'River of the Field' in Hungarian. It was also
called Bor Ysthenes, which is again a Hungarian name, meaning



'Divine Water' or 'Fine Water'. Then Herodotus lists a series of
arguments why the river is so fine. This river "has upon its banks the
loveliest and most excellent pastures for catties; it abounds in the
most delicious fish; its water is most pleasant to the taste; its stream is
limpid." All these added expressions bolster the Hungarian etymology
of the word Ysthenes. And the other part of the river's name, 'Bor',
signifies in the local Sekeli-Hungarian dialect of Transylvania,
'drinking water', most often of thermal origin.
Turning now to the Scythian ethnic and personal names, we again refer
to Herodotus who says that the name by which the Scythians above
the Black Sea called themselves, was Scoloti, whereas the Assyrians
called them Ishkusai or Ashguzai and the Greeks simply Skytoi. When
these names are placed back into their original spelling, according to
the phonetical evolution of the Hungarian, they prove to have been
taken from the Hungarian vocabulary. All the names in question
terminate with the adjectival suffix -i, which gives the name the
meaning of 'originating from', 'coming from' or 'native of'. It follows
that the preceding word must indicate the specific geographic area
where the Scythians formerly lived. In the case of Scoloti (< H.: Ös
Kelet-i) this original homeland is 'Ancient Orient' (the same as Chaldi,
Khaldi), by which name Babylon was also called. The meaning of Ish
Kuza-i and Ash-Guza-i presents no difficulty, when remembering the
easy interchangeabi-lity of the kindred consonants K, G and H. It
means in Hungarian Ös-haza-i 'Originating from the Old Fatherland',
—again Mesopotamia, the same geographic area. At first sight, less
evident is the etymology of Skytoi, which may be the Grecized form of
the original Hungarian Szigeti 'Coming from the Isles', a reference to
their sojourn in the thousand islands of the rivers Kur and Araxes in
the southern Caucasus.
All the names analyzed were first given to the Scythians while they
were still living in the Caucasian region, busy reconstructing their



political set-up with various 'blood-contracts'. They retained these
names even later, when another of their group settled in a similar
region, around the other side of the Caspian Sea (in Touran). Because
of the multitude of isles in that area as well, Ptolemy called it Insulae
nationum, 'Isles of Nations'. From the third century B.C. onward, when
the Scythians had already lived for generations in their acquired
'Scythia', they were no longer considered as newcomers, but as
'natives' in their own country. Accordingly, they began to be called
Hon-i, or in ancient Hungarian spelling: Huni 'Natives', 'Country-Men',
again in plain Hungarian. The first Scythian detachments posted on
Hungarian soil were the Agathyrsi, in the Upper Maros valley,
Transylvania. They were assigned to frontier-guard duties, as their
name clearly implies: A Gath Yrsi < A Gát Őrző 'Guardians of
Embankments'. The last Scythian confederation of tribes to settle in
Hungary were the Yazigues: they settled between the Danube and the
Tisza rivers, in the southern central part of Hungary in A.D. 20. By
trade, they were cattle keepers and shepherds, as is proven by their
name: Yazigue < Jószág (őr) being 'Cattle (keepers).
The list of Scythian ethnic denominations can be completed by a few
royal names with a clear meaning. These are mainly the ones which
include the distinguishing word 'Aryan', Ur, Ar in Hungarian, as Aria
Peita <Arja Fajta 'King who is of Aryan origin'; Ari-Antus <Arja Honős
'Aryan Land Ancestor'; Scyl-Urus < Urös 'Székely Ancestor'. All the
foregoing details are sufficient to convince the reader that the
Scythians were misjudged until now as far as their ethnic and linguistic
identity is concerned. It seems absolutely certain to-day that they were
Magyar tongued and belonged to the once widely diffused Hungarian
race.
The written documents the Scythians left behind them bring fresh and
decisive evidence to the above conclusion. Amongst such documents,
the oldest one is written by the pictorial method which conveys



abstract ideas by images of similar-sound-ing concrete objects, as has
been indicated several times. In Scythian practice, and also elsewhere,
the pictorial writing was mainly used to express royal titles, such as
Ancestor, Divine Ancestor. For the former title, the image of an eagle
was used, whereas for the latter, that of a stag. The names of these
animals in Hungarian, Sas and Szarvas, sounded, indeed, like Az ős
and Az Urős respectively. This method of identifying rulers by that way
was very widespread, especially in the first millenium B.C., so that a
golden stag found in a Scythian mound was considered by
archaeologists as the supreme evidence of being connected with a
royal tomb.
Because of inherent difficulties, pictorial writing was rarely used for
communication of messages of any length; we know of only two such
examples, both recorded by Herodotus. The first message narrates
how the newly acquired Scythian Kingdom was inherited by Colaxis,
the youngest of the three sons of Targitaus, the conqueror (P 067
Book VII cap. 64). God had strewn upon the earth, from the sky, four
golden implements: a plough, a yoke, a battle axe (sagaris) and a
drinking cup. The Kingdom should be inherited by the one of the
three brothers who could pick them up. The two elder brothers failed
to do so because the gold took fire as they approached it. But when
the youngest born neared the treasure, the flames suddenly vanished,
and he picked up the gold. What was the divine message written with
these golden objects? We can find out by writing down, one after
another, the names of the four items in the Hungarian language:
EKE.IGA. SAGARIS.KUPA, which gives the following similar sounding
sentence: E7KEIG/AS/AGARIS/ KEPE: E kölyök az Égurös képe 'This
child is the deputy for the Heavenly Lord'. That meant, in
contemporary language, the Colaxis (the Child) must assume the title
'God on Earth', i.e. the royal dignity. The children had understood the
message and they agreed to bequeath the kingdom to the youngest



born —says Herodotus.
The second known pictorial message of the Scythians, also in the
Hungarian language, was sent to King Darius in 512 B.C., when the
latter invaded Scythia to avenge the destruction of Assyria, a hundred
years earlier. As the Persian armies bogged down, following the
scorched earth policy of the Scythians, Darius, to save face, declared
that he would be satisfied with a symbolic submission by receiving the
usual water and earth gift from the Scythian king. But, instead of the
required gift, the Scythian king sent Darius a bird, a mouse, a frog and
five arrows. The Persian king thereupon consulted his chief advisors to
find out the meaning of the message. There was, indeed, no doubt
that this was a written document. The advisors were divided in their
interpretation: some deciphered it as a peace-offer, the Scythian king
would be willing to make to the Persians. Others thought that the
message contains a serious threat, viz. that all the Persians will be
killed with arrows. Darius agreed with the second reading and, panic
stricken, left Scythia on one of the following nights. To find out the
meaning of the strange message, we again write down the
corresponding Hungarian words: MADÁR. EGÉR.BÉKA. ÖT. NYIL and
we find the similar sounding, sentence: Magyari kér békét őnála,
'Magyar asks for peace with him', exactly as the first group of advisors
had deciphered the message. A second interpretation is possible, when
the word for mouse (egér) is replaced by another one for the same
animal, Sir, used by the kindred Komi (P 060 p. 19). In that case the
message reads thus: Magyar sírba küld nyíllal 'Magyar will kill thee
with arrows'. And that was the way Darius himself interpreted the
intention of the Scythians.
Besides the pictorial writing, the Scythians were also acquainted with
the carved script and bequeathed us a unique message written in that
way. It is engraved upon a silver dish 14 inches wide found near the
town of Sakiz to the south of Lake



Urmia. It is decorated with animal figures in a row between two
concentric circles. Its featured decor was a golden horse, set in the
centre. The treasure was meant for a wedding present offered by a
Scythian prince on the occasion of the marriage of King Bartatua or
King Madyes, to an Assyrian princess in the second half of the VIIth
century B.C. (P 054 p. 106; P 123 p. 22 f.). The script (reproduced in
P 054 p. 109 and explained in P 007 II p. 63 f.) reads thus in
Hungarian: E kis tálcát valaki bőkezűen neki adja; as éke ló 'This small
tray is generously given to him by somebody; its adornment is a
horse'. After that follows the value of the ware, in conformity to
ancient uses and customs. Now, the expression 'its adorment is a
horse' conceals the identity of the donor as Sekeli, 'a Siculi'.
Finally, we must mention that the Scythians probably had studied and
used Greek letters as well, proof of which are two coins of the Indian
Saka-dynasty (first century B.C.). On one of the coins the following
Magyar words appear: TURANNO UNTOS 'ERAOY and on the other
side: SAKA KOGGANOI. On the second coin: YRKODOY MAKAROY,
and on the back: SK'WR (i.e. SAKA UR), (transliteration in P 059 p.
133). According to the present Hungarian orthography, the
inscriptions would read thus: 1. Turáni Honös, Király — Székely kagán
'Touranian land -ancestor, — Siculi kaghan' and 2. Uralkodója Magyar
— Székely úr' 'Its ruler is a Magyar, a Siculi Prince'.
The three kinds of writing illustrated — pictorial, carved and
alphabetical — definitely prove our previous statement: that the
Scythians were a Hungarian-speaking people, literate and skillful in
writing.
4. Who were the Kelti or Celts?
History books tell us, that around 300 B.C. the name 'Scythian'
abruptly vanished from circulation, and that per contra, the Kelti



name made its appearance at about the same time. Is there any
connection between the two phenomena? Nobody knows with any
certainty, in spite of ample available material for the study of Celtic
problems. In Hungary alone, for example, over 590 Celtic sites were
discovered until 1976, — says Miklós Szabó, author of a book on the
Celts in Hungary (P 119 pp. 36 and 16). The basic two volume
publication of Henri Hubert (P 070) gives a great deal of factual
information about the general history of the Celts, but is already
somewhat antiquated. Two smaller recent works, the comprehensive
study of Venceslav Kruta (P 083) and Jan Filip (P 049) respectively
are far from able to fill the gap. None of the authors mentioned took
full advantage of the invaluable help toponymy offers to scrutinize the
Celtic place-, ethnic and personal names, although such names are
copiously recorded even in J. Caesar's De bello Gallico. Furthermore,
Celtic inscriptions engraved upon coins and other archaeological finds
were also not taken into due consideration. We even ignore the
meaning of the very name: Kelti.
As regards the ethnic identity of the Celts, it was thought, two
generations ago, that they were an individual, original human species,
i.e. men of high stature and fair complexion. To-day our scholars are
inclined to see in these 'first Europeans' rather small-statured, lightly
brownish complexioned 'Mediterraneans'. Again others are of the
opinion that the Celti were only a ruling class over the previously
immigrated, predominantly pre-Indo-European population. Still others
think that the Celts were Indo-Europeans who strongly mixed with the
aborigines. We do not lack hypotheses, but the truth is, as V. Kruta
puts it: "For the time being, there exists no indisputable evidence for the
ethnic appurtenance of those who have been called the 'Princes of the
first Iron Age" (P 083 p. 64).
In the present state of our researches, we must make use of
circumstantial evidences to learn more about the ethnic identity of the



Celts. A closer look at the manifestations of Celtic civilization,
convinces us that they contained no new feature; all their most
striking characteristics having already been evident in the previous,
Scythian civilization. These included the fortified place protected by
embankments, ditches and hedges, the multitude of animal images
which pervaded their arts, the use of horses and sunworship, a
heritage from the New Stone Age. There was only one new addition to
Celtic culture: the extensive use of iron. It follows that the 'Celts' must
have been an amalgam of the previous non-Indo-European inhabitants
of Europe. This is exactly what scholars have discovered during the
course of their comparative studies. It was found, indeed, that the Picti
of northern Scotland were already Celts — "early Celts" — who called
themselves by that word in the form of Khaldes or Chaltis, which is
the Kelti in ancient graphic form (P 132 p. 139). J. Hawkes also places
the makers of the bell-shaped vessels into the category of the Celts.
There too, the peoples of the barrow-graves can be found (i.e. the
Scythians, P 049 pp. 16 and 20), and also the Turoni, who migrated
from Central Europe to the banks of the Loire (P 089 p. 11), as well as
the Secani, who went from Hungary to France, etc. There were also
peoples called Kelto-Scythians, Kelto-Ligurians, Kelt-Iberi. Thus, it is
evident, that the Celts were not a new race in Europe, and the Celt or
Kelti name was used as a comprehensive designation of the entire pre
Christian population of Europe.(47)
The huge and kindred Celtic mass of B.C. Europe was linked together
by a common language as well, in addition to the above-mentioned
identical elements of their civilization. According to the estimate of
Camille Julien (Paris) "a hundred million" Europeans spoke the Kelti
language in the second half of the first millenium B.C. Consequently,
there was no linguistic barrier in ancient Europe.(48) In spite of these
categorical statements, nobody has, alas, identified the Celtic
language, nor proved its affiliation with any other. In that respect we



are still completely in the dark. The reason? Nobody has yet
approached the Celtic problem with the Hungarian key. In the
following, we shall try to analyze the etymological meaning of the
fundamental word: Kelti.
Before us, Henri Hubert, the most eminent French specialist of the
Celts has made great efforts to find out the meaning of the Celti name.
He carefully noted all the various graphic forms in which this name
occurred and concluded (1) that it reached its widest diffusion during
the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and (2) that it contains the rootword
Kel (Quel in French graphic form), "implying the idea to rise" (P 070 I
p. 27). He mentions this meaning as the most probable one, amongst
many other conjectures listed in a footnote. He could, however, not go
any farther in his explanations, thus the question remained unsolved.
(49)
In Hungarian the word Kel signifies 'to rise' and Kelet the cardinal
point where the Sun rises, i.e. 'Orient, East'. And the same word, when
the -i suffix is added as Kelt-i, Kelet-i means 'He who has come from
the direction of the rising Sun', i.e. from the Orient. In ancient times,
this word was spelt in various ways, such as Chaldi, Chaldean and
Scoloti. Like most ancient Hungarian ethnic names, it indicates no
ethnic particularity, but is merely a geographic appellation recalling
their previous fatherland. As such, it was a fitting comprehensive
name, because all the pre-Indo-European ethnic groups originated
from the same region: from the ancient Orient. Thus, the name Kelti or
Keleti was the general term designating all the Hungarian speaking
ethnic groups which had migrated to Central and Western Europe from
the ancient Orient since the New Stone Age.
The Kelti were a very cultured human mass, to whom Europe owes a
great deal. They were the one who christened all the great rivers and
mountains of that continent, who designated the places of the future



great cities, and planned the first network of communication. They
were the 'first Europeans'. Had History given them another hundred
years, they would have formed a great unitary nation, centered
around Gallia and Hungary. But this century had not been granted to
them. As is known, the Romans, "who have become the enemy of the
race which founded it", literally destroyed this nation during its
gestation. The holocust of the Celts in Gallia was perpetrated by Julius
Caesar and his legions, in the first century B.C., between 59 and 51.
They systematically massacred all the political leaders of that nation,
their soldiers and priests, killing altogether three millions and setting
fire to eight hundred towns and villages. After that, the people were
economically ruined, terrorized, assimilated and Romanized. The
history of Europe does not know of any other similar killings. Yet, Caesar
had been whitewashed by historians of all his crimes and stands before
us as a "Great European". Only the Kelti in Hungary were capable to
outlive the century of hell in Europe.

THE HUN HUNGARIANS
1. The Roman and Germanic influence upon the ethnographic
conditions in the Carpatho-Danubian basin
1. The peaceful penetration of Magyar-speaking Oriental tribes into
the Carpatho-Danubian region was interrupted after the Scythian and
Celtic periods and was replaced by armed interventions from the
West. First came the Romans, an imperialist people. After having
created a solid basis on the Apennine peninsula, they gradually
extended their domination over the entire Mediterranean area during



the second and first centuries B.C. Thereafter, for growing security
and economic reasons, they extended the frontiers of their Empire up
to the Danube, which meant, for Hungary, the occupation of her
western province, Transdanubia. After a difficult and long war (from
12 B.C. to 9 A.D.) they besieged it and about fifty years later
converted the conquered land into a Roman province, under the name
of Pannónia. They ruled this province for about four hundred years,
and then gradually handed it over to the Huns, between 409 and 433.
What interests us, regarding the Roman rule of Pannónia, is to
ascertain what had happened to the large Magyar-speaking population
there. In that respect, we must first recall that the Roman conquest
was prompted by strategic considerations and its military character
was predominant up to the very end. Above all, the Romans wanted to
build a strong military barrier along the Danube. Secondly, the
province's Roman governors were not as blood-thirsty and ruthless as
was Julius Caesar in Gaul. Thanks to these circumstances, the Roman
conquest was neither followed by wholesale massacres of the
inhabitants, nor by the extermination of the upper classes, nor by the
colonization of the land by a Latin-speaking population. The former
tribal structure of the society was maintained, including local
administration (P 087 pp. 112, 117). The legions which were keeping
watch on the Danube, and the various auxiliary personnel employed
for guarding the military roads were mostly manned by a local
population, including their commanders. Moreover, what was no less
important: the Romans did not suppress the native beliefs. Thus, once
the war was over, life, on the whole, followed its ancestral course.
Taking all that into account, our scholars evaluated the effect of Roman
rule in Pannónia, from an ethnographic point of view, as harmless.
Those who studied Hungarian life in Pannónia under Roman rule
more closely, have pointed out certain linguistic facts which evidence
the survival of the Hungarian language. The very name of the land



Pannónia, for example, is a Hungarian compound with Pan and Hon
(=H.: Fenn-Hon) meaning 'Upper Land'. The most important city was
Savaria, so named after the Sungod (cf. Savi-tra, Savarna, P 044). In
that city, God was worshipped in a great temple, which had an
immense Sundisc above its altar. The present-day village of Szabar,
near ancient Savaria, probably retains the ancient city's names.
For the survival of the Hungarian language under the Roman rule, it is
highly significant that the Roman emperors, coming from Pannónia,
used Hungarian throne-names, as did Had-Ri-Anus (117-138), Aur-Eli
Anus (270-275), Val-Eri-Anus (253-260), and Sev-Erus (193-211). In
these names the Hungarian component -Anus (= Honős) often
appears, meaning 'Country Ancestor', or the word -Erus (Urős) 'Divine
Ancestor'. It is not surprising to find so many Hungarian traces in
Pannónia, since the political and military centre of the Roman Empire
was, in the third and fourth centuries A.D., no longer in Rome, but in
Pannónia and Illyria instead. During this time, these provinces, or
rather their inhabitants, supplied the best soldiers, governors, and
emperors, and also 'Roman' virtue.
After the conquest of Pannónia, the Romans conquered the eastern
part of Hungary as well and emperor Trajan converted it to another
Roman province named Dacia. The emperor personally conducted the
military operations (101-105). The occupation of this land was
actually prompted by economic reasons: the Romans wanted to lay
their hands upon the abundant supply of gold, silver, copper and salt
which was mined there. Dacia's occupation was, however, short lived,
lasting about a century and a half. Indeed, the province had to be
abandoned in 271, when Roman personnel was evacuated and
withdrawn to the southern shore of the Danube. The three most
important Dacian cities, Sar-Mizegeth-Usa, Napo-Ca, and A-Pu-Lum
have clear Hungarian meanings. The first name would be in present
spelling Sár-Mezőket-Ásó (city) 'Where gold fields are dug', the second



Nap-Kő 'Sun City', and the third A Fő Ló (városa) '(City) of the
Principal Horse', also a Sun city.
The Roman never subjected the mountainous northern section of
Hungary, nor the great Central Plain, between Pannónia and Dacia, to
their rule. The tribes living in that part of the land maintained their
independence. So, Roman domination passed without vital harm in
Dacia as well. But, by dismembering the Carpatho-Danubian land into
three parts, they retarded the unification of the diverse social groups into
a single nation, a process which had been going on since Scythian times.
Thus it happened that the territorial re-unification of the entire
Carpathia area and the building of a nation befall the next generation of
great leaders: King Attila and Prince Arpad.
2. Shortly after the Roman Empire's entry into the Carpathian basin,
Germanic tribes also began their penetration into the land. They started
from their northwestern homeland Scandia (Scandinavia) pushing
eastwards on the East-European table-land until they had reached the
River Don in the third century A.D. They were called Goths, and
formed two separate groups, the Ostro-Goths and the Visi-Goths. A
third Germanic tribal federation, the Gepids, was formed inside the
Carpathians, in Transylvania, above the Maros river, as far as the
Tisza.
The appearance of Germanic tribes in Eastern and Central Europe
filled the Romans with fear, so they encouraged the Huns, who were
also threatened, into action. The tense situation provoked the armed
intervention of the Huns in 375. After this, Germanic rule crumbled
away and the Huns gained control over all eastern and central
Europe. This is all well known in history, so that we do not need to
discuss it. But less known is the ethnic build-up of the Germanic tribes
in question. It is, indeed, a false assumption that the Germanic tribes
were as fully Germanic in Eastern and Central Europe as they were



when invading continental Europe from Scandinavia around Christ's
birth. The explanation is obvious: when the Germanic tribes started
for the distant adventure, they usually travelled without women folk
and therefore strongly mixed with local population during their
wanderings. That had the effect, that within three or four generations,
they were a completely different people from the one that set out. The
following short analysis will show how the Germanic tribes mixed
with Hungarians when they reached the domain of the Magyar ethnic
body.
The name Gepida was given to the confederation of Germanic tribes
which occupied northeastern Hungary. It has no accepted etymology
in the Germanic language, but has in Hungarian, where Gyep-i Ta
means '(Men) of the Grass-Land', where the Gepids actually lived. And
in the case of the Visi-Goths, which name is supposed to signify 'West
Goths' in the Germanic language, the Hungarian gives again a more
plausible explanation. In it Visi (in to-day's Hungarian Vizi) means
'Those who live near water courses', which was again true of the
Goths. The Germanic ethnic identification symbols were also taken
over from the local population, particularly the eagle, typical symbol
of the steppe population, and also birds in general. We should also not
forget that Gothic script, the so-called Runen, was a simplified Magyar
carved script. Its German name originated from the Hungarian word
róni 'to carve'. Thus, we should agree with the statement of Gyula
László, according to which "the scant upper class of the Goths, the
conquering layer, underwent an almost complete transformation
under the impact of local traditions and customs" (P 087 pp. 161
164). The modified social structure of the Goths and Gepids was one
of the main reasons why they accepted to stay in the Carpathian land
so readily even after the Hun conquest, faithfully serving their new
king Attila. All that considerably modifies the image we had of the
migration of the Germanic peoples, at least in the sector of



southeastern Europe. It altogether confirms that the aboriginal
Hungarians could keep their own ethnic identity unchanged. And that
was the most important feature of the Middle Danube basin on the eve of
the coming of the Huns.
2. The coming of the Huns
The Huns emerged in history as an Oriental people living on the
pastures of the Oxus river valley, to the south of the Aral Sea.
However, in the second century A.D., most of them had already
skirted the southern end of the Caspian Sea and were in possession of
the land above the Caucasus mountains up to the mouth of the Don
river, the steppeland of former Scythia. Their westward move was
prompted by fatal climatic changes which transformed their cradle
land (Touran) into a semi-desert. Increasing temperatures resulted in
a considerable reduction of the water supply and the grass of the
fields vanished. Thus the Huns, living from animal husbandry, had to
move and look for new grazing land. At the same time, as just
mentioned, Germanic tribes were advancing eastwards on the great
European Plain, by occupying more and more pasture, until they too
had reached the river Don and came in direct contact with the Huns.
Alarmed by their double misfortune, the Huns felt that their very
existence was being threatened and that provoked their violent
reaction. Under their first great king Balamber, they attacked the
Ostro-Goths, their nearest adversaries, and swiftly broke their power.
The Ostrogothic ruling class took refuge in Pannónia and proceeded to
Italy a little later. The bulk of the Gothic population, however,
submitted to the Huns and was incorporated into their politico
military system as a separate entity under its own leaders. The next
Germanic tribal federation, the Visi-Goths, located on the northern
bank of the Lower Danube, seeing the defeat of their brethren, offered
no resistance, but gave up their land, crossed the Danube and entered



into the Roman Empire. Thus, the Huns, with a single sweeping
action, arrived at the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in 375
A.D.
Immediately thereafter, the Huns began planning the occupation of
the last western segment of the great Eurasian steppeland, the
Carpathian Lowland, inside the mountainous arc, by concluding pacts
and alliances with their kindred tribes: the Yazigues in the Danube
Tisza quadrangle, the Skirs (= Sikeli) in the western half of the
country, the Carpodari in Upper Hungary, as well as with the Romans
themselves, whose famous general Aetius became their most
important ally. By virtue of these multiple alliances, the Huns gained
control of the whole basin inside the Carpathians, without employing
military force. Since the land was given over to Hun sovereignty
peacefully, without war, and with the blessings of Rome, the local
population had no particular reason to expeet hardship. It remained
intact and offered its services to the Hun king, a friend of Rome. The
Huns set up their permanent head-quarters in the heart of the land, at
the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros, wherefrom King Oktar (
+ 430), King Ruga ( + 434) and thereafter King Attila (+453)
governed their extensive empire. Thus, with the coming of the Huns,
Roman and Germanic dominions in Central Europe were liquidated and
the aborigines liberated.
Aetius continued to court the Huns, even after their installation in
Hungary, encouraging them in their westward advance, in order to
ease the Germanic pressure on the northern borders of the Roman
Empire. For the Huns, the prospect of a possible extension of their
sway upon the whole of Europe was an alluring offer, but, as it turned
out, a miscalculation. King Attila was unable to win a clear victory in
the great battle at Mauriacum, near Troyes, France, in 451. The
immense efforts this war required in men and material, and the
authoritarian manner Attila handled his subalterns, overstrained the



socio-political structure of his realm. So, when Attila suddenly passed
away in 453, his empire crumbled, in large part because of the
intrigues and rebellion of the Germanic tribes. Attila's sons were
defeated in the struggle for the succession (455) and returned with
their clans and kinsmen to Scythia, the tract of land above the Black
Sea, beyond the Carpathian ranges. They did not, however, forget
their ancient grandeur and Prince Csaba, the youngest son of Attila, as
soon as he was back in the old country, began to spread the idea of an
armed return to Pannónia (= Hungary), to take revenge upon the
Germans, whom they considered as the main artisans of their defeat.
On his death-bed, he bound his people by oath, to return to Hungary,
as soon as they had gathered enough strength, to rebuild a Hun state.
Thus, the Huns did not disappear as it was sometimes surmised in
certain historical books. They stayed in the immediate neighbourhood,
waiting until the clock would strike the hour of their return. This
moment arrived in 568.
At that time, a strong federation had come into being with the fusion
of two great tribes: the A vari and Chunni consisting mostly of white
Huns. The name Avari (< H.: A vár-i) means 'He who comes from an
embanked stronghold', and Chunni (< H.: Hun-i, i.e. Hon-i), Huns. J.
Thury, a Hungarian historian, established that 37 different sources
identify the Avars ethnically as Huns (P 059 pp. 113,128). In the
Carpathian basin, they mainly occupied the Great Central Plain and
Transdanubia and also considerable parts of present-day Austria and
Dalmatia. The Avars kept their empire and their independence until 796,
when they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who
destroyed their State, whereby the pendulum swing, once again,
westward.
3. The ethnic identity of the Huns
The true identity of the Huns has not yet been clearly established: "We



know nearly nothing about their early history" and "the history of
Attila is still to be written" (P 061 p. 127). Our evidence on the
anthropological build-up of this nation is scanty, because the Huns
cremated their dead, thereby leaving no direct anthropological traces
of them. Hence, what we know about them comes mostly from
second-hand records. In contemporary and later accounts, the Huns
are said to be of mixed origins, like all nations with an Oriental
background. A major proof of this, as is usually pointed out, was their
skin colour which was generally brownish, although there were typical
white Huns as well. Their colour difference subsisted even in the
fourth and fifth centuries, which indicates that the fusion of the two
racial elements of this people had not yet been achieved at that time.
This state of their ethnic evolution explains why they were not only
called by their common name Huni, but also by other names which
emphasize their racial origin. They were called Kush when their
darkish colouring was more evident (P 092 pp. 14 f., 19-22), and
Aryans (< H.: Uri, Ari), when the white complexion predominated.
King Attila is described in the chronicles as a short-statured, darkish
complexioned man, of haughty walking.(50)
The various appellations of the Huns all have some significance in the
Hungarian language. Their most frequent Huni (< H.: Hon-i) name,
often written without H as Unni, Uni, means 'He who lives in the same
land', i.e. who is a native of the country, a compatriot. It is a
geographic and political term, irrespective of racial origin, as were
also the previously analysed names of Magyar, Hungar, Siculi and
Kelti. Thus, the main connecting link amongst all these peoples was
their common Hungarian language and their identical Oriental origin.
Therefore, they mixed easily, once they were placed under a same
sovereignty. And there can be no mistake if Attila is referred to as the
King of Hungary (rex Hungáriáé), since the Huni were considered as
Hungarians (Huni sive Hungari).



In addition to their general names (Huns, Kush, Hungarians) the
various factions of this people also came under local denominations.
(51) These secondary names were mainly noticed after the collapse of
the Hun Empire, when several smaller political entities came into
being. These names usually included the distinctive word -Ág- Ur
'Ruler of the branch so and so'. Examples: Kutzi-Ág-Űr, Hun-Ág-Ur, Sár
Ág-Ur. The ethnic identity of the Huns is nevertheless best evidenced
by their own written records, which we discovered and which we are
now going to analyse in more detail.
4. Hun-symbols and written records
It is often assumed that the Huns were an illiterate, barbaric people
who left no written records. This opinion actually stems from the
inability of scholars to identify and decipher their script. In fact, as
shown below, the Huns bequeathed us with a considerable amount of
written records, most of which turned up in Hungary, the one-time
centre of their vast empire. Apart from sources of archaeological
provenance, diplomatic records also mention their ability to write and
to read. We have, in this respect, the rare testimony of Priscos Rhetor,
one of the most credible observers of the Huns, who led an embassy to
the court of King Attila. He mentions in his report that the King
requested the extradition of certain fugitive Huns, whose names he
read out in his presence from small wooden sticks, from the Byzantine
emperor. Another proof of the Huns' writing ability is the fact that the
incised or carved script was always called a "Hun writing", "Hun
letters" and "Alphabet of the Huns" in Hungary. The legend about
illiterate Huns must be abandoned.
Most existing Hun inscriptions have gold as supporting material and
as such display a solemn character. But the daily records which Priscos
Rhetor himself had mentioned were made on wood or on other
perishable material, which deteriorated and are now lost for ever.



Another preliminary question to be answered is whether the existing
Hun inscriptions, especially those engraved upon expensive materials,
could have really belonged to them at all. We have no reason to doubt
this, since our historical sources are positive in stating that the Hun
kings were, in general, fond of gold, like all Oriental rulers. We read
in these records that Attila's dining table was made of solid gold, and
his cooking dishes were also of gold.(52) The same sources mention
the existence of a huge Hun golden treasure, which later on became
the property of the Hungarian kings by law of succession and was
always kept in Hungary, at the royal court. The treasure included the
legendary sword of Attila, the so-called Sword of God, implying
Attila's divine origin. Moreover, Hungarian medieval charters certify
that Ottokár II of Bohemia was asked to restitute all the gold to the
King of Hungary, which his grandmother, Ann of Masovia, unlawfully
carried away from Hungary to Bohemia. Amongst these precious
jewels "was an expensive gold dish, adorned with the finest and most
beautiful precious stones, as well as many other famous jewels, which
were kept in Hungary from the time of Attila, king of Hungary, and his
successors until now."(53) The listed data dispel even the slightest
doubt one may have that Attila had been the owner of gold dishes and
other precious jewels, which were inscribed.
On the following pages we will show a few Hun symbols, to begin
with, which were used for the purpose of identifying the ruler by
means of homo-phony, i.e. the pictorial method of writing which was
common to all Oriental rulers during Antiquity. Attila's best known
such symbol was the Ast-Ur bird, whose image he wore on his shield.
This word sounds like Est-Ura, 'Ruler of the West'. This title may have
originated from the time when he was only ruling the western half of
the Hun Empire, his brother Bleda having been in charge of the
eastern part. Furthermore, Attila was also called God's Whip, which is
another play on sound for the same title, whip being Ostor in



Hungarian, homophonic with Est-Ur. Finally, a widely used Hun badge
was the stylized insect having the outlines of a bee (H.: Méh), which
identified its bearer (Ur, Ar), as Méh-Ar, i.e. Mahar or Magyar.(54)
Another group of Hun-identifying objects consisted of quadrupeds:
mostly dogs, foxes, and wolves. They were used as totems,
designating the clan from which they had originated. On the basis of
such assumed names, certains Huns could have considered themselves
as "Sons of the Dog" or "Sons of the Fox". King Ruga was probably 'Fox'
(H.: Róka), while King Oktar may have been 'Mr. Dog' (H.: A kutya
ur). The speech of the Huns, especially their battle-cry, was said to
resemble "the roaring of lions" (P 099 pp. 64, 147, 178).(55)
The author has deciphered several of the Hun inscriptions which are
engraved upon gold dishes, found at Nagy-Szent-Miklós, to the south
of the river Maros, which was the central district of the Hun Empire.
The cache was discovered in 1791 and yielded 23 pieces (dishes,
juges, goblets, etc.), all made of solid gold, weighing altogether 9,925
gr. The commodities were probably not for everyday use, because they
are conserved in almost perfect condition, without any trace of wear
or tear. It is likely that the purpose of these jewels was rather to
preserve important historical messages for the progeny, like royal
records. In addition to the individual inscriptions, five richly adorned
vessels (numbered 9, 10, 17, 22 and 23) bear an identical short script.
It always reads from right to left and was written in memory of the
goldsmith who made the decorations: pictures and interwoven
figures. The script (Fig. 32) reads in Hungarian thus: áR-U Ké-Pé.T 1
T.eR.éK U.N CSi-Ná.Ta, in present Hungarian orthography: Árú képét
egy derék hun csinálta, in English: 'The adornment of this article was
made by a skilled Hun.'



Fig. 33. Hungarian language message engraved upon a Hunnic
gold tray. Treasure of Nagy-Szent-Miklós, Hungary.
A longer inscription appears on a gold tray (Fig. 33), marvellously
adorned with a Tree of Life (genealogical tree), flanked on both sides
by two stylized attendant animals. In the higher ranking position there
are two dog-like creatures with pointed ears, and on the second one
are two quadripeds with birds' beaks. The picture may point out the
two major Magyar-speaking peoples of Hungary at that time: Huns
and Magyars. The one line inscription below the picture reads from
right to left and is transliterated thus: aD-iSZ.eN iR-T eR.aN-O.Ni
Ro.Ko.N-oK E.L-aT-Ne-Fe-Ke E.L-T-eK J-U Fó-T, in present Hungarian
spelling it would be thus: A díszen irt Irán-honi rokonok állatnevekkel
éltek; jó volt. Its meaning: 'The Iranian relatives represented on the
ornament, used to live under assumed animal names; that was an
advantage.'
The longest inscription shown here is engraved upon a golden dish of
which there are two identical ones (Fig. 34). Its distinctive feature is
an equilateral cross-sign, placed in the middle of the dish, and is



surrounded by a circular inscription. It was executed with great care,
no doubt because it was King Oktar's royal seal, bearing his full title.
We shall not enter into discussing the complicated meaning of the
cross-sign, but only of the script itself, which reads counter-clockwise,
starting at the 12 o'clock position. The transliteration of the signs is
thus: Ne.Te.T.I-K uN Ki.Rá O.K.T.áR O.R-SZ-E-EGe A.Ra-K Jo.K-oN Ve
Te P-A.Ra-To.K-T-O(l) Po.N-T.I-aK I.SZ.T(er) Vi-Té.Ki-E-K O.Ra-Li-aK
Tó.T-oK U-RA. In full Hungarian: Negyedik hun király Oktár országa.
Örök jogon vette barátoktól. Pontiak, Ister vidékiek, Uraliak, Tótok ura.
In English: 'Realm of the fourth Hun king Oktar. He bought it from
friends by hereditary right. He is the ruler of those living above the
Pontus (= the Black Sea), in the Ister (= Danubian) region, in the
Ural area and of the Slavonic peoples.'



Fig. 34. The great seal of King Oktár the Hun with legend in
Hungarian.
The last Hunnic inscription we will be discussing was found outside
Hungary. It is incised on the pendant of a necklace found in Wolfheim,
Rhein-land. The name of the village where it was found, signifies the
'Dwelling Place of Wolves', a typical Hun designation. The relic comes,
in all probability, from a group of Huns who found refuge there after
the collapse of their Empire. The message on it was prepared with
philological precision (Fig. 35) and is transliterated thus: E.N-G-aR
N.E-N-eT.oL EL-O.N-A.N-aK Na.T.A-P.A Ungár nénitől Ilonának,



Nagyapa 'From Aunt Ungar to Helen, Grandfather.'
The contemporary written documents of the Huns constitute the decisive
evidence that these people were literate, having strong cultural relations
with ancient Egypt, and spoke Hungarian. Their records repeatedly say
that they originated from the Ancient Near East (Iran), and had
acquired their Carpathian land peacefully, by virtue of diplomatic
accords.

5. The bad image of the Huns in Western Europe
After all we have said about the Huns, the question that comes to
mind is how could they have had such bad press in western Europe to
this day. This hatred is focussed mainly upon King Attila, the most
brilliant figure of his race, secondly, upon the Hun people themselves.
As is disclosed from the analysis regarding this subject (P 099 and P
072), chronicler Jordanes, a man of Gothic descent, started the
defamation. It was he who invented the tale that Attila was not a
human being, but rather a monster, born from the love of a dog and a
witch and had a doglike appearance (canis aspersus), with pointed ears.
This monster image has come into circulation, in all probability,
through misinterpretation of the Hun custom of using animal symbols
to indicate their tribal or national appurtenance. So, when the Huns
said that they originated from a wolf or a dog, the naive western
priests and chronicle-writers took these expressions literally, and



justified their abhorrent image with the Huns' own words.
The Huns' monster image was confirmed by a second feature, namely
that God had selected the Hun king to fulfill the ungrateful mission to
be God's whip (flagellum Dei), a kind of Anti-Christ, to punish,
especially the Latin peoples, for their wickedness and crimes. This
second gossip originated obviously from the misinterpretation of the
Huns' original symbol, the whip, which in their symbolism, meant
simply that Attila was the ruler of West, as explained above. Thus the
whip in the hand of Attila had as little to do with a punishing mission
as the one in the hands of Egyptian Pharaohs. If Jordanes, this first
western propagandist, could have had the opportunity to travel
throughout the Hun Empire, he probably would have avoided
spreading so much inconsistency amongst his countrymen. Herodotus,
almost a thousand years earlier, did his reportage on the Scythians
more conscientiously. He spared no trouble and travelled to Olbia, on
the Black Sea shore, to gather firsthand information. The description
of Priscos Rhetor is similarly much more accurate because he had met
Attila personally.
Ordinary Huns were also heaped with slander. It was asserted that
they were subhuman beings, the descendants of Scythian witches and
of unspecified devils, and that their way of life consisted only of
looting, perpetrating robberies and killings. And their speech? Oh,
they did not have any, their mouth could only give out short and
inarticulate sounds like fleeing animals.(56) This latest Hun-feature
also originated from the miscomprehension of the metaphor,
according to which the Hun battle-cry was likened to the roaring of
lions, as the ancient Egyptian kings have done when in battle. To sum
up, all the interpretations the Westerners invented reflect their naivety,
lack of experience and a great deal of bad faith.
The Hun armies never sacked Rome, the holy city of Christendom,



although they could have done so in 452, having arrived at the gates
of the City. In the western interpretation this was not due to Attila's
orders, but to a miracle: the apostles Peter and Paul appeared with
shining sabres above Attila's head, and this sight frightened the
would-be robber who fled. Thereafter, the lucky city was, however,
repeatedly robbed and burned by Germanic tribes. First by the Visi
Goths of Alaric in 410 A.D., and then by the Vandals of Gaiseric in
455, when the two saintly apostles failed to pull out their sabres to
chase away the real robbers. But such arguments would carry no
weight with the makers of myths who persisted in their belief that
with the Huns, the scum of Earth had inundated Europe.
The traditional Hun-phobia of medieval western writers clouded the
clairvoyance of the modern historians as well who were unable to
reason otherwise and saw in Attila the prototype of the Barbar: the
uncut, savage man who built nothing and destroyed everything for the
sake of destruction. They forget that the mass-murderer Julius
Caesar was the true scourge of God in Antiquity, and that the words
Vandal and Vandalism, were not a Hunnic, but of western origin.
Fortunately, Hungarian historians have never accepted the Hun-image
elaborated by their western colleagues. For them, King Attila was the
first great Magyar ruler in Europe, who liberated their forefathers
from the western yoke, stopped both Roman and Germanic
penetration, and rolled back the invaders of the Carpatho-Danubian
basin thus preserving the precious ethnic and political equilibrium in
central Europe. Hungarian historians, also, did not ignore the military
genius of Attila, and stated emphatically, that the Huns had not only a
highly developed culture, but that they had doubtlessly surpassed
western civilization which was at that time, in its darkest "dark age"
(decadence of the Roman and Byzantine empires). Even Charlemagne,
the great Frankish ruler, could not sign his name.



We have to admit, however, that the western historians of today are
making efforts to form a more truthful view of the Huns, bringing it
more into harmony with our modern scholarly standards. After this
cleansing operation, all the incredible features of the Hun-portrait
have been discarded, notably those concerning the Huns' monstruous
origin, their animal language and their so-called earthly mission. But
it will be some time until past conventional wisdom is replaced by the
results of modern research. As an illustration of this process, we read,
in a recent publication, the admission that "the threat which they (the
Huns) had posed to western civilization has probably been
exaggerated" (P 104 p. 69). German authors recognize that the Huns,
as body-guards, were more reliable than their own fellow countrymen.
(57) It shall also be noted that, after all, the central figure of the
German sagas was precisely Attila (cf. Nibelungenlied). Germans even
want to claim that Attila was one of their kinsmen, his name being a
Germanic word, meaning something like "Daddy".(58) It is really high
time that the distorted image of the Huns, this dark blot on western
historiography, make way for some more serious consideration, wherein
the great-power status of the Huns and their world-empire are
acknowledged and appreciated at their proper value.

THE MAGYAR HUNGARIANS
1. Massive influx of Magyars into the Carpathian Land and the
birth of Hungary-I
After the collapse of the Hun rule in Hungary (453), the major
Germanic tribes of the country — Goths, Gepids and Longobards (the
latter since 526 only), — set up individual principalities and quarreled
violently amongst themselves. The Longobards were striving for



predominance but, not having the necessary strength to achieve it,
asked a Hun faction of Eastern Europe to help them defeat their rivals.
With the support of this Magyar tongued faction called Avari (Avars),
the Longobards drove out the Gepids, but felt so insecure in their
domain that they deemed it advisable to evacuate Hungary. They
actually fled to Italy in 568, together with their families. After that, the
Avar Hungarians set up their own kingdom (568-803) in the entire
Carpathian area. At the beginning, the Avar Kingdom extended from
the Don in the East to the Enns in the West. Later it shrank and
covered only the Carpathian basin, the Vienna Plain and the
Bohemian Plateau.
There was much speculation about the ethnic identity of the Avars.
But it seems certain that they already spoke Hungarian when they first
appeared on the scene of history. Their name Avari (< H.: A vár-i)
means, indeed 'Those who live in enclosures (Rings)'. And the throne
name of their first great ruler, under whose leadership they entered
the Carpathian land, was Baján (< H.: Be-Jön), a homophon of 'He
who comes in'. More information is available about the ethnic identity
of the second Avar ethnic wave (670), composed of "White
Hungarians", as is definitely stated in the Russian chronicle of Nestor.
The vastness of Magyar human material that settled thus in Hungary
at that time is reflected by the great number of their graves which
have been excavated, 40,000. The newcomers occupied the edges of
the Great Central Plain, and Transdanubia, and also southern
Hungary, i.e. the best arable lands of the country. The seat of their
government was in Györ (< H.: Gyürü = 'Ring'), a strategically
located and well fortified stronghold at the confluence of the Raba
river and the Danube. The Hungarian chroniclers never use the term
Avar when speaking about them. They call them simply Hungarians,
as do the majority of West-European chronicles as well. They add, at
best, a few adjectives for the sake of a clarification, like "Avars who



are called Hungarians" {Avari qui dicuntur Ungari); "Avars who are
called Huns and Hungarians as well" (Avari qui et Huni sive Hungari).
By the same token, un Avar king is mentioned with the title of "King of
Hungary". The latter has been a famous ruler because his daughter
Berthe became the wife of Pepin and subsequently the mother of
Charlemagne. The quoted data clearly suggest that from 670 onwards,
the Magyars already formed a united nation in the Car-patho
Danubian basin and had an organized State headed by kings. That
was a historical event, and this explains why Prince Arpad could set
up a smoothly working State-apparatus so easily after his entry into
the land. For him, the help of the Hungarians in the Rings was
inevaluable.
The Avar-Hungarian kingdom lasted for about two and a half
centuries. Afterwards, the reorganized Frank Empire resumed past
Germanic expansion toward the East under the half-Hungarian
Charlemagne (771-814) who organized a series of razzias against
Hungary between 796 and 803 and destroyed its central government.
Charlemagne was not much interested in territorial gains. He
preferred to loot the Rings, where the nation's treasures — gold, silver
and precious stones — were guarded. On a single occasion, for
example, he 'collected' so much treasures that 14 wagons were needed
to cart them away from Hungary. Chronicler Eginard (Einhard)
commented on that big haul by saying: "According to human memory,
there was no earlier war in which the Franks have become as wealthy
as just now; for until now, they were poor" (cf. P 098 pp. 113, 240).
As regards the Magyar population of Avar-Hun-gary, it survived the
loss of their State and continued to live almost undisturbed. The
largest administrative unit which continued to function was that
located around Lake Fertő, a rather swampy region in western
Hungary. It was last mentioned in 873. A second surviving mini-state



was the realm of Tudun, in Upper Hungary. This one endured until the
coming of Arpad in 895. The harmful consequence of Frankish
incursions into Hungary was the creation of a politico-military vacuum
in a so vitally strategic part of Central Europe, which caused a lot of
inconveniences both to the local population and to the Germans as
well. Therefore, emissaries were sent to the East-European Arpad
Hungarians even by the German king Arnulf who urged them to come
in to help stabilize the situation. The craving for a new unifier was
fulfilled in 895, with the entry on the scene of Prince Arpad. His coming
opened a new chapter in Central Europe's history.
2. Hungary's ethnographic and political conditions in the IXth
century
1. In the previous chapters we have explained how Magyar-speaking
ethnic groups continuously poured into the Carpathian land, ever
since Neolithic times. They came in successive waves, in increasing
numbers and under various denominations: Magyars, Székely, Kush,
Scythians, Celts, Huns, Avars, etc. Their common starting point was
the Ancient Near-East and they were linked by ethnic, cultural and
linguistic ties. This morphological coherence of the early Hungarians
is probably the most important discovery in our recent historical
science.(59) Now, it will be interesting to find out whether the earliest
population and its descendants were still evident in the IXth century,
at the eve of Arpad's coming.
A first indication of the presence of Magyars is that the mountain-,
river- and village-names they had imparted to the geographic features
of the land were still all in use. Furthermore, their identification
symbols: the bird, the bee, the lion and the ram were also deeply
embedded in the folklore, which was strongly impregnated with
suncult and with general Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Syrian
connections. All that would be impossible to explain without the



continuous presence of the same population and, what is more,
several other reliable sources especially mention the presence of
Hungarians in the land at the said time. During the reign of
Charlemagne's successors, for example, a bishop Hungarus by name, is
mentioned in a charter of 888, and Louis the German, for his part,
refers to a mountain called Marca Vengeriorum, in his charter of 860
and even Charlemagne had several times referred to a Hungarian
stronghold in Transdanubia, Sárvár by name (P 059 pp. 241-242).
And, above all, there is a recently discovered Hungarian chronicle
which survived through a Turkish translation (XVIth century), which
states that the Hungarians of Arpad were greatly pleased to learn,
upon their arrival in that country, that its inhabitants spoke the same
language as they did. Thus it is evident that Hungary was already
populated with Hungarian-speaking people before the coming of
Arpad.
2. Anonymus, our best informer on the IXth century events, records in
his Gesta Hungarorum (c. 1200), that the Arpadians, upon entering
the Carpathian basin, had found a large population there whom he
calls Sclaui, Rameni and Blachi. Scholars have been baffled by these
names he alone mentions, all the more since the proffered
explanations led to chronological and linguistic absurdities. Who were
these peoples? The etymological approach gives us the first important
key to this mystery. The Sclaui name, to begin with, is a Hungarian
compound word which includes the following elements: S-K-Lau-i. At
its ending we notice the adjectival suffix -i, usually meaning 'Follower
of, 'Coming from'. The word Lau, which precedes the suffix, is the
dialectal form of the literary Ló, whose first meaning is 'Horse'. In
ancient times, however, the Sungod was meant by it, who was
imagined as riding upon a horse in the sky.(60) The remaining part of
the word, S-K, when vocalised appears as As Ék, or in softened form:
Az Ég, and means 'The Sky'. Thus the whole compound S-K-Lau-i = Az



Égi Ló-i means literally 'Follower of the Heavenly God', i.e. sunwor
shippers. Consequently, the form Sclaui is not an ethnic denomination,
but a religious one, meaning simply sunworshippers.
The Sclaui dwelt all over the land, but their main settlement areas
were in Transdanubia and in Upper Hungary. Now, these regions were
exactly the same ones where the Székely-Hungarians (,Sikeli, Sikeloi,
Siculi) lived until their partial transfer into Transylvania. Incidentally,
their name includes the very same three consonants, S-K-L, which are
to be found in the name of
S-K-Lau-i. Furthermore, in the present-day Székely local language the
word Ló (horse) is often pronounced as Lau, and means, when used as
a title, not horse, but Lord, as in the nobiliary title Ló-Fö 'Highborn
Man, Marquis'. Finally, the Si-keli were also ardent worshippers of the
Sun and their popular art is full of the symbols of the ancestral
suncult. Their name, in the form used two thousand years earlier, was
also analyzed as signifying 'Follower of the Heavenly Lord'. Upon the
basis of so many similarities, we must concede that Anonymus had, no
doubt, meant that group of Hungarian-speaking people under the word
Sclaui, which was mentioned in earlier sources as Sikeloi, i.e. the
present-day Székely, a group probably originating from the
Mesopotamian cultural sphere.
According to Anonymus' narration, the Rameni were natives of
Transdanubia. Their name contained the following components: Ra
Mén-i, a fine Old Hungarian word, meaning 'Follower of the Divine
Stallion', i.e. again sunworshippers, but this time of Egyptian
persuasion. This term probably meant a Hun faction (Huni or Honi =
'Native'), whose name he renders in Latin as habitatores terrae. — The
third group of Hungarians mentioned by Anonymus in their religious
context were the Blachi who used the carved script to write, remarks
the chronicler. This fact alone strongly suggests that they originated



from the Syrian cultural sphere. Their name confirms it, since its
etymological meaning is the Hungarian Bal-Lak-i 'Originating from
Baal's Dwelling', Baal being the Syrian Divinity of Fire', a local variant
of sunworshippers. They are also called Balasi or Blasi, a synonym
meaning 'He who comes from Baal's House'. There are many
Hungarian place-names compounded with the divine name Baal, such
as Bala, Balaton, Bala-vár, Bálványos, Bélkö, etc. The same name
occurs outside Hungary, in such well known geographic names as the
Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic Sea and region, Belgium, etc. Julius
Caesar mentions in his De bello Gallico that Volok (Volcae) people
were living, together with Rutheni, on the northern foothills of the
Pyrenees (P 030 II p. 36 and Index and map). That all these groups of
peoples were mentioned in their religious connections is revealed by a
remark by Anonymus, a Christian priest, who said that the Sclaui and
Blachi were the most wicked people of the whole world, simply
because they served pagan divinities (viliores homines esse totius
mundi quia essent Blasii et Sclaui, P 120 I p. 66).
The continuous use of Near-Eastern religious names is an obvious
proof that the descendants of the Neolithic and Bronze Age
inhabitants of Hungary still formed the bulk of the population in the
IXth century A.D. Nonetheless, it is impossible to make an
approximate calculation about their numerical strength on the eve of
Arpad's coming. We can only guess their relative importance, on the
basis of a specific archaeological fact: from the late Avar period,
Hungary has 40,000 authentic excavated graves, whereas from the
period of the reunification of the land under Arpad, we only possess
10,000. That would mean that the proportion of long settled
Hungarians to the Arpa-dian newcomers, was 4 to 1. The survival of
Hungarians of diverse religious affiliations in the Danube basin since the
Neolithic and Bronze Ages makes them the most ancient inhabitants of
Europe, who were capable of preserving their original ethnic, linguistic



and cultural identity throughout millenia.
3. To complete our survey of the situation in the Danube basis toward
the end of the IXth century, before the arrival of the last major
Hungarian ethnic wave, we must take a look at the political build-up of
the land. It was a chaotic one, because after the destruction of the
Avar-Hungarian State in 803, the country's organization, in the
absence of a central government, relapsed to tribalism and
regionalism. In north-western or Upper Hungary, there existed a small
post-Avar principality centred around the fortress of Nyitra and well
protected by high mountains. Its existence was continuously
mentioned in historical annals until 875, date of its conversion to
Christianity. Upper Hungary's most famous ruler was Prince Tudun,
whose name is last mentioned in a charter of Pope Eugene II in 826,
wherein he was admonished for building Christian churches (P 109 II
p. 35). Tudun is an
Oriental throne-name (< H.: Tudó-(H)Ona: Tóth-Hon) meaning 'Land
of God Thot' (the Egyptian divinity). At the time of the re-unification
of the country under Arpad, the ruler of that region was Prince Zobor
(<H.: Az Avar) meaning 'The Avar ruler'.
South of Upper Hungary, up to the River Raba, and including the Fertő
Lake, lay a second post-Avar principality. Its administrative centre was
Győr ( =H.: Gyürü 'Ring'). Other minor principalities were around
Lake Balaton. All these western Hungarian post-Avar principalities
were given more freedom of action after the division of the Frank
Empire into three nationally based political entities in 843. They
utilized their liberty by seeking help from their fellow Hungarians,
beyond the Carpathian arc, in Eastern Europe.
The Great Central Plain of Hungary was under the nominal sovereignty
of the Bulgarian Empire and was governed by native princes. At its



southern end, in the Danube-Tisza quadrangle, lived the Alan people
called Yazigues; they were obedient to Prince Salan (<H. Az Alán)
'The Alan'. The separate identity of the Yazigues had already been
erased in the Hun period, but their administrative autonomy subsisted
until 1848. The northern portion of the Central Plain was under the
authority of another local prince, Laborci by name, who ruled from his
fortress-city of Hungvár, 'Hun Fortress', according to Anonymus.
To the east of the Tisza, extending up to the Carpathians three small
principalities flourished. The strongest of them ruled in the region of
Szamos and Körös, with a military base in the mountain fortress of
Bihar. The last ruler of this principality was Mén-Marut, whose throne
name meant 'Sungod's Stallion' (Mén = Stallion; Maruth = the Hindu
name of the Sungod). This monarch lived in Oriental fashion, he even
sported a harem at his court, and ruled over a mixed population called
Chozari (<H.: Kos-Ar-i). The second eastern Hungarian ruler, Dux
Gelu or Gyula, governed the Upper Maros area in Ul-transylvania,
'Beyond the forested Land', his throne-seat being at Gyalu. He was
probably a priest-king, whose symbol, a torch, was carried before him
when he travelled officially (P 120 I p. 95). Another high official of
this petty kingdom identified himself by wearing a sun-disk. The last
Gyula maintained his quasi-sovereign status until the reign of King St.
Stephen (1000-1038), who had him captured and imprisoned for life,
"because he was an inveterate pagan, refusing to become a Christian
and was, in many ways, an annoyance to St. Stephen", writes
Anonymus. — The third and last east -Hungarian petty kingdom
included the area bounded by the rivers Maros, Tisza and the Lower
Danube, with a royal residence at Orsova (= Ur Szava) 'Voice of the
Ruler', like the post-Hittite state in the Ancient Orient, Ar-zawa. The
Prince's name in Latin script was Glad or Clad; it is the softened form
of the original Hungarian word Keleti, i.e. 'Oriental'.
As has been proven in the foregone analysis, all the princes and their



petty kingdoms mentioned in the historical sources of the IXth century
definitely bore Hungarian names and ruled over a Hungarian
speaking population. Prof. János Me-lich, a very conscientious linguist,
came to the same conclusion in his last important scientific paper (P
097). He re-examined the pre-Arpadian prince-list and found that
Menmarut and Glad were certainly native Magyars and that all the
other local rulers spoke "faultless Magyar". He also stated that the
great majority of Hungary's population spoke Hungarian on the eve of
Arpad's coming and was racially inter-related.
3. The formation of the Arpadian people in Eastern Europe
Recent historical studies emphasize that the human mass led by Arpad
into the Carpatho-Dan-ubian basin, significantly differed from those
Hungarians already living in that country. The Arpa-dians evolved,
indeed, their ethnic constitution during the sixth to the ninth centuries
only, by merging with westward-moving Hungarian and Turkish
peoples, on the Eastern European Plain. This all began with the
sudden entry of the Turks into the Caspian-Oxus-Aral area in 568 A.D.
That first blow was followed by a second and more violent one in 597
598. As a result, all the tribes living in the southwestern corner of the
great Eurasian steppe began to roll westwards.
The Turks were mostly stock-breeding, mounted nomads of inner
Asiatic origin, having various independent branches, like the Bisseni,
Chasari and Cumani, to mention only those with whom the Magyars
were to come into closer contact. They had their own language, which
has borrowed heavily from the Hungarian vocabulary, and which,
most likely, also included their historical names. In fact, their names
seem to have been given by Hungarians, since they all have a definite
meaning in that language. The word Turki (anc. form: Tourki), seems
to have resulted from the merging of four elements into a single word:
Tó-Ur-Kö-i, meaning literally 'Those who dwell (-i), in the Land (Kö),



of the Ruler (Ur) of the Lake (Tó)', in short 'Lake Dwellers.' The
implied lake was no doubt, the Aral Sea, because it is surrounded by a
lowland called Touran (< H.: Tó-Ur-Hon), 'Home of the Lake Lord'.
The name Bisseni, Pissoni or Pice-Nati (< H.: Pis-Hon-i; today: Viz
Honi) means 'He who lives by the Water'; and Pice-Nati, in inverted
word order (< H.: Nagy-Viz-i) 'He who lives by the Large Water',
probably referring to the Caspian Sea, for originally they had actually
lived on its shores. As regards the Chasars (Khazari, Chosari) their
name is a compound with Kos +Ar + i, i.e. descendants from the
merging of (white) Aryans and (darkish) Kush peoples, as rightly
observed by the Arab writer, Abu-i-Feda, who said: "The Khazars... are
of two types: some are dark-skinned, often almost black; these are
considered as being of Hindu descent. The second race is white
skinned and exceedingly beautiful" (quoted in P 081 p. 56). In the
beginning, the Khazars dwelt on the northern shore of the Caspian
Sea, whose original 'Hyrcania' (= Aryan) name was changed into
Caspis (< H.: Kush-Viz) 'Water of the Kush'. Ail this points to the
important fact that the Turki peoples were a combination of the
subjugated Aryan and Kush population, with a significant admixture of
Mongol elements.
The first Turkish ethnic branch with which the Arpadians came into
close political union were the Khazars, as was recently demonstrated
by Arthur Koestler (P 079) and Vilmos Kovács (P 081). The Khazars
spoke the Tchuvash dialect of Turkish and had laid the foundation of
their empire in the second half of the Vlth century, more exactly in
567. They became the mightiest power in Eastern Europe in the VHth,
Vlllth and IXth centuries. They had extended their domain over the
entire area to the north of the Caucasian ranges, and subjected the
westermost seven Magyar tribes, living between the Kuban and Don
rivers, to their rule, as well as those who dwelt between the Kuma and
Terek rivers, on the western coast of the Caspian. All these Magyar



tribes living in Caucasia, originated from northern Mesopotamia, the
Kingdom of Urartu, and from the post-Hittite states of Syria, especially
from the Kingdoms of Arpad, Karkemish and Damasek (Damask).
They had to leave their old fatherlands, following the bloody
expansion of the Semitic Assyrian Empire, in the second and first
milleniums B.C. In our historical sources, the memory of the
Hungarians at the Don has been preserved under the name of Dentu
Magaria and of those of the Kuma valley as Kum-Magaria.
The Hungarians of Dentu-Magaria have been incorporated into the
Khazar Empire in 568 A.D. and their symbiosis lasted for over three
hundred years. They were entrusted with the all-important task of
safeguarding the western flank of the Khazar Empire and to block the
descent of the Slavonic peoples toward the south. To fulfill their duties
more efficaciously, the seven Magyar tribes in question were
transferred later to a more suitable location, between the Don and
Dnieper, above the Black Sea. The same strategic considerations led
the Khazars to place the Magyar tribes under a single command, for
which Arpad was selected. His installation as 'Deputy king' was carried
out according to Khazar customs, by elevating him on shields. And the
leaders of the seven tribes, for their part, swore allegiance to Arpad,
solemnly declaring that they would faithfully carry out his orders. All
that may have happened around 850, which may be considered the
birth-date of the East-European Hungarian nation, the Danubian one
having already been in existence for a long time.
The Khazar-Hungarian alliance worked well for about two hundred
years, but when the Khazar king adopted the Judaic faith around 740
and forced it upon his court and military men, the first internal
tensions were quick to appear. A civil war erupted in which the rebels
were defeated. As a result, three deeply involved Khazar tribes, called
Kabars, went over to Hungarian side and were absorbed into their



socio-political system. Then came the renewed attack of the fearful
Bisseni-Turks, who had torn away the pasture-land from the Magyars
and forced them to move more westwards (889), into the Dnieper
Seret-Lower-Dan-ube area, thereby severing their secular alliance with
the Khazars completely. At that time, they had already acquired
enough political maturity to make their own decisions as to the best
way to ensure their survival in social surroundings that were growing
more and more precarious.
Their own worry, which was also shared by the Danubian Hungarians,
gave rise in c. 890 to the idea of merging the two Hungarian nations
into one, inside the spacious Carpathian arena which could be
defended more easily than any tribal community on the unbroken,
vast plain beyond the Carpathians. In the meantime, they had to fight
a mysterious battle against the Cuman-Turks near Kiev, of which we
have no details. It is definitely known, however, that the Cumans'
seven tribes were defeated and that they swore an oath of allegiance
to Arpad and then they too were absorbed into the constantly swelling
Magyar conglomerate, which already consisted of seventeen tribes.
Finally, the descendants of Prince Csaba, the youngest son of King
Attila, also joined the Arpadians, together with their innumerable
clans and cognates of the same region. After all these happenings, the
people Arpad led into Hungary were considerably different from the
Danubian Hungarians. Racially, they were of Aryan, Kush and
Mongolian factions. By religion, they were sunworshippers,
fireadorers, Ismaelits and Moslems. Ethnically, they had strong Turkish
traits, bearing such names as Magyar, Khazar, Kabar, Kuman, Hun,
Bisseni, etc. —a real mosaic with a Turkish veneer. In the Byzantine
court they were classified simply as Turki, and not Hungarians. How
did it happen then, that they could, nevertheless, build a Hungary
with all its components and not a 'Turkey'?
4. The re-unification of the country and the birth of Hungary-II as



a modern state
1. After the destruction of the Avar-Hungarian Kingdom by the Franks
in 783-803, the whole Carpathian land relapsed into a state of
political anarchy and became a battlefield for half a dozen dukedoms
and neighbouring great powers. No wonder that the Hungarians
already in the land, had sent emissaries to their brethren on the other
side of the Carpathians, urging them to move in to rebuild, together
with their united forces, the realm of their great ancestor, King Attila.
The Arpadians received similar suggestions from the interested great
powers, namely from King Arnulf (887-899) of Germany, and the
Byzantine emperor Leo the Wise (886-912) to help achieve their own
political objectives. By this means, the Arpadians had several
opportunities of exploring their future land, especially in 862, 881 and
892. All our evidence points to the fact that the vital decision was
already taken in 892.
The preparations for the conquest were in full swing at that time. In
Kiev, where Almus, the father of Arpad was the deputy-king, all the
available blacksmiths were summoned to make hundreds of thousands
of horseshoes, arrows, cartwheels, swords and the like, which were all
kept in storage. Three hundred lumber jacks were also engaged to
clear a passage through the thick forest. A pincer movement was
planned, according to which the bulk of the invaders would penetrate
into Hungary under the leadership of Arpad through the Verecke-pass,
which had never been used before (841 m above s.-l.), and the second
army, under the command of Arpad's father Almus or his elder son
Levente, was supposed to check the Bulgarian forces and penetrate
into Transylvania through its passes and gorges. The invasion started
in the spring of 895 and, except for the unexpected attack of the
Bisseni and Bulgarians, the Hungarian armies met inside the
Carpathian arc during the summer of the same year, as planned. By
900, the entire territory was in their hands, including Transdanubia.



The incoming Arpadians were greeted as liberators and most of the
native populations surrendered spontaneously to the new master of
the land and even helped with the unification. Those few princes and
dukes who failed to change their allegiance in time, paid dearly for
their mistake. Laborci, Gelu and Zubur who resisted, were killed in
action. Two others, Salan and Glad, fled with their followers. The case
of the sixth prince, Men-marut, was a particular one, insofar as he had
wanted to resist at first, but, at the sight of Arpad's armed men, had
asked for a compromise, offering his daughter in marriage to Arpad's
youngest son Zsolt, while he himself swore obedience to Arpad. In
exchange, he was permitted to keep his stronghold of Bihar as a fief
for life. History knows of very few conquests as clean as Arpad's, which
was accomplished practically without bloodshed.
As soon as the territorial unification of the land was achieved, Arpad
summoned the leaders to his fortress of Csongrád and hammered out
the principles ('Constitution'), according to which the reunified
country was to be governed. The next step consisted of setting up
nation-wide institutions, to bind all the inhabitants of Hungary
together into indissoluble unity. These institutions were almost
exclusively, the creation of the native, and not of the half-way
Turkized Hungarians. In other words, the newcomers were culturally
absorbed into the Magyar-speaking local population which formed the
overwhelming majority in the land. This process is well illustrated by
the following remarks. The unified country became a "kingdom" (and
not a khanat according to the Turkish pattern), with a "king" as its
ruler (and not a khan or kende). The highest officials were the Maior
Domus Nádor and the Chief Justice, Ország-biró (and not Horka and
Kádár). The king was represented as someone seated upon a throne
(and not in a saddle on horseback). The symbolic animal identifying
the king was a lion (and not a hyena, ram or dog). One of the most
important institutions, which welded and kept the various elements of



the society together, resulted from the adoption of Christianity. The
new faith imposed, indeed, a common and uniform ideology, and
replaced the pagan Sun-, Fire-, and Baal-cults, which had earlier kept
the nation divided into several parts. Thus, the merging of all
Hungarians of diverse origins, creeds and political traditions into a single
nation was achieved within a relatively short lapse of time.

2. Prince Arpad (+ 907) was not only a military genius but a
successful organizer as well. He clearly perceived the geographic unity
and the strategic position of the Carpathian arena, welded between
two powerful empires. Accordingly, he did not divide the country
amongst the seven princes who were his deputies. On the contrary, he
considered the mountainous periphery of the united land as its



natural defense line and the whole country as an important element of
the European equilibrium, as set forth by the treaty of Verdun in 843.
He was, therefore, anxious to put an end to the encroachments of the
little Moravian State and incorporated its borderland into Hungary in
902.
More fighting was needed before Arpad's strategic-political conception
was recognized and accepted by the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary's
dynamic western neighbour. This empire was naturally inclined to
expand eastward along the Danube valley. The most opportune time
for the realization of its ambitions seemed to arrive with the death of
Arpad, when huge armies were dispatched on both sides of the
Danube toward Hungary. They were, however, defeated right at the
border, in the marshy region of Pozsony (Pres-burg). As a result of this
decisive Hungarian victory, the Danubian provinces of present-day
Austria were annexed by Hungary as far as the river Enns. The whole
area remained under Hungarian rule until 933, when one of their
armies was defeated near Merseburg, and again in 955, near
Augsburg. After these events, Hungary's western borders were
gradually withdrawn to the line of the Lajta and Fischa rivers, where
they were stabilized for a thousand years and mutually recognized.
After that, there was no obstacle for the participation of Hungary
under Prince Géza at the meeting of Quedlinburg (973), called in by
the German emperor Otto the Great, to discuss the common security
problems of Central Europe.(61) The memory of Hungarian rule in
Moravia has been kept alive until our days by numerous village
names, built upon the Hungarian vocable, such as Uhersky and Uhr
Sitz (7 such names), or with other Hungarian words, such as Sallash
(= Szállás), the Hungarian for 'summer dwelling'. Similarly, many
Hungarian village-names survived in the Ostmark, out of which 25
include the word 'Hungarian', such as Ungar-Bach, Ungar-Stein, Ungar
Berg, Marca Hungarica; 103 others are compounded wirh Warte-,



Schiitze and 196 are built upon Ode, meaning uninhabited land, all of
them being situated within the former defense line, as explained by
Sándor Török (P 129 p. 22f).
The relations between Hungary and the Holy See of Rome were always
cordial, as soon as the Hungarians had put their heads under the
baptismal water, thereby irrevocably becoming loyal members of the
new European community. Pope Sylvestre II together with the German
emperor Otto III, recognized Hungary as a sovereign State. As a token,
he sent a golden royal crown to the ruler, who was solemnly
proclamed 'King of Hungary" on Christmas Day of the year 1001. The
Pope's gesture was repeated later by the emperor of Byzantium, who
also recognized the sovereign status of Hungary. The two crowns were
welded together into one and symbolized the great powers' alliance
with Hungary.
The Holy See of Rome also entrusted the kings of Hungary with the
mission to defend, spread and propagate Christianity in the
neighbouring pagan countries, especially in the Balkan Peninsula,
which was full of schismatics at that time. This resulted in Hungary's
expansion toward the Adriatic Sea by including Croatia (1097),
Dalmatia (1105) and Bosnia (1210). Thus, at the end of the XIth
century and the beginning of the XIIth, not only was Hungary's sovereign
status universally recognized, but the country had become a powerful
kingdom, ranking third in importance, right after the Holy Roman and
the Byzantine Empires. So, after a successful start, Christian Hungary
was heading toward the finest hour of its history.
Thus, the period of Ancient History of the Hungarians came to a close.
5. Epilogue: The fate of the lost Hungarian tribes
After the bulk of Hungarian-speaking peoples -Scythians, Huns, Avars
and Magyars- moved out of Eastern Europe and settled in Hungary,



this race ceased to play a significant political role in the oriental part
of the continent. Ethnographi-cally, however, it continued to be
present, since numerous large factions, which were separated from
the main body, stayed behind. The reason for such detachments were
varied. First it was the general custom that migrating steppe peoples
must leave an adequate number of warriors and woman folk behind to
stand guard over the ancient land, upon which they could fall back,
should the search for new and better grazing land fail. Then, internal
political tensions may also have caused secessions. Furthermore, and
most frequently, they were exposed to enemy attacks which could cut
off thousands of people and sweep them away from the main block.
Larger Hungarian break-away tribes stayed behind in the following
areas: 1. in Caucasia, 2. in the Volga region, 3. in Touran and 4. in
Moldavia.
1. In Caucasia, the detached Hungarian tribes were those living
between the Kuma and Terek rivers, on the northwestern side of the
Caspian Sea, called Kum-Magaria. Bear witness of their tribulations
eight papal edicts (Bulls) granted between 1245 and 1291. Their texts
have been published by László Bendefy (P 010). Among the other
contemporary documents relating to the problem we can mention an
inscription carved on stone, found in the Crimean Peninsula and
deciphered by the author. Finally, tradition also deserves to be
mentioned, preserved by both the Danubian Hungarians and the
successors of Hungarians in the East. Amongst the most important
historical studies devoted to this question are the works of L. Bendefy
(P Oil) and János Boros (P 018). But in spite of this apparent richness
of documentation on this topic, many questions remain unanswered,
so that our account is still conjectural on several points.
The Caucasian Hungarians were characterized by the fact that they
lacked comprehensive political organization for a long time, having
lived in chaotic conditions, each of their clans and tribes by



themselves, in as many mini-states. With the emergence of the Mongol
threat, however, the feeling prevailed amongst them, that for their
mutual defense and survival, they must unite their forces. Accordingly,
they all placed themselves under the authority of King Yeretany. This
king wanted, above anything else, to give his kingdom a Christian
organization. Therefore, he turned for help to the Holy See, asking for
catholic priests. These antecedents led to the emission of a first papal
edict by John XXII, on behalf of the "most eminent Prince Yeretany."
We read the following passage in the said edict: "Greetings to our son
Yeretany and other Christian Hungarians (in Caucasia)... We have
understood that thou, my son Yeretany, who art a descendant from the
earliest Catholic kings of Hungary, wanted to receive, together with
other Christians of the said region... a Catholic missionary (doctorem
Catholicum desiratis habere>.)." The first "Catholic Doctor" arrived at
Magyar-on-the-Kuma in the person of Bishop Thaddeus (1331-1334).
He was followed by seven others, the last one holding office from
1366 to 1377. It is not known what became thereafter of Yeretany, but
his epitaph, found in the Crimea suggests, that he was himself a priest
and fled westwards, before the Mongol invasion. His inscription
actually reads thus: "Here is kept, by the Armenian monks, the holy
treasure of Yeretany, an Iranian lord and prince of the Don-bank. (This
treasure) consists of two church-cans. Great holiness was the
distinctive mark of this 'living God'." The dreaded onslaught of the
Mongol armies materialized in 1395/96, when the city of Magyar was
destroyed and the Kuma-Terek plain incorporated into the Kiptchak
Turk empire as a province. The few surviving Magyars then retreated
into the mountains and F. Nansen, the Norvégián explorer, was the last
European who spoke to their descendants in 1925.
2. The second and by far the largest Hungarian-speaking ethnic group,
that of the Volga Hungarians was detached from the main body
somewhere to the north of the Caspian sea in the Vlth century



following the attacks of the Turks, and was pushed northwards along
the river Volga. They were met be the imperial ambassador
Zemarchus, who talked with the "Prince of the Hungarians, who
reigned by the grace of Dizabuli khan" (On-gororum dux qui illic ex
auctoritate Dizabuli impérium habebat" (P 092 p. 93 f.). They were
then lost from sight and had no contact with any other Hungarian
group for about 600 years. They were rediscovered quasi accidentally
in 1236 by zealous Dominicans (Black Friars), who originally wanted
to find the Caucasian Hungarians, for they wanted to convert them to
the Christian faith. Four missionaries started on this venture in 1235,
via Constantinople. However, when they arrived at the city of Matrica
(the present Taman), at the entrance of the Maeotis (now Sea of
Azov), they altered their itinerary for an unknown reason and instead
of continuing eastwards, they turned directly to the north, journeying
along the west bank of the Volga. Finally, Friar Julian, the only
surviving priest, succeeded in finding a large Hungarian tribal group
"near the Great River Ethyl."
There is a report on this unique journey, written in the XHIth century
and submitted to the Holy See of Rome, where it is kept in the Record
Office. Its text is published in the collection of medieval writings
edited by Imre Szentpétery and is currently known as the "Richardus
report" (P 120 II pp. 535-542). This report describes the dramatic
encounter thus: "He (Friar Julian) found them near the great river
Ethyl ( = Volga). When they learned that he was a Christian
Hungarian, they were greatly pleased about his coming. He was
shown their houses and cottages and was pressed with questions
about the king and the realm of Christian Hungarians. To everything
he told them, about faith and other things, they listened attentively,
because their language was entirely Hungarian and they understood
him and he them (quia omnino habent Hungaricum idioma et intellige
bant eum et ipse eos'•)." Julianus then promptly returned to Hungary



to impart his important discovery to his brethren at home. In the next
year (1237), Julianus undertook a second journey to the Volga, but
was unable to reach the Ungarian settlement because the Mongolian
armies were already on the way to make new conquests. In that very
year, Hungary at the Volga had been destroyed, and the nation's ethnic
identity abolished for ever. The surviving individual Magyars were
scattered all around within a radius of about 200km, on the Volga
Heights, around the Pensa and Sura rivers, with some settlements at
Saratov, Tambov and Riazan. Today, their memory is kept alive by a
great number of place-names which include the Magyar name. The
local inhabitants remember that they have Hungarian blood in their
veins, but do not speak Hungarian any more; Turkish and/or Russian
being their language (P 019 p. 229 f.).
3. The Touranian Hungarians always lived somewhat apart from the
other Near Eastern Hungarians, to the east of the Caspian Sea, around
the Aral Sea and in the Oxus valley. In Hungarian chronicles, this is
the region which probably appears under the name of Magoria. This
ethnic group first attracted the attention of our historians in the last
century, when Kristóf Lukácsy devoted a fine work (P 092) to them in
1870. More recently, after World War II, the same area came once
again into the forefront of research, thanks to the insistence of Erik
Molnár, whose example was followed by Tibor Tóth, P.-T. Veres and Pál
Lipták, who all underscored the close connections of the Ura-lian
Hungarians with the Touranians. But it is Antal Bartha who deserves
the credit for having discovered the earliest role of the Touranians,
who were responsible for the civilization of the local population of the
Ural region and that of Western Siberia, in the Und millenium B. C.
The surviving traces of the lost Touranian Hungarians were also
carefully recorded (Kath. Magyarok Vasárnapja, January 12,1969;
Kanadai Magyarság, November 23,1968; Sorsunk, Sidney, February
13, 1960, etc.) and the villages, with 'Madiar' names, noted.



A major faction of Touranian Hungarians seem to have been swept far
away, towards southeastern Asia, into what is today New-Zealand,
where they continue to call themselves Maori (<Ma-Ur-i), i.e. Magyar.
Their existence has been discovered by F. A. Uxbond (alias Wilhelm
von Hevesy) in his sensational book, published in English in 1928 (P
130). This publication lists innumerable evidence to prove that the
Maori are closely related to the European Hungarians, both racially
and culturally. The Maori of to-day are highly civilized, but almost
entirely absorbed into their English-speaking surroundings. The
mystery of the origin of this ethnic faction has not yet been fully
elucidated, which is perhaps connected with the expansion of the
Kushan Empire.
4. Our record would not be complete without mentioning the break
away Hungarian group of Tchangos, now living in Moldavia, on the
other side of the Carpathians, near the rivers Tatros and Sereth,
numbering altogether 170,000 souls. The capital city of Moldavia is
Yassy, the Hungarian Jász-Város 'City of the Yazigues'. Their full story
is related in a recently published 1520-pages monumental
sociographic study, by Pál-Péter Domokos (P 043). The colony started
at the beginning of the Christian era, with a faction of Yazigues that
did not continue its journey into Hungary for reasons unknown to us,
but stayed behind, breaking all relations with their brethren who had
entered Hungary and settled there. The Yazigue colony of Moldavia
later received additional Hungarians, when the warlike Cuman-Turks
set up a principality in Moldavia, then Cumania. To protect Hungary
against the harassments of this pagan people, King András II (1205
1235) placed border-guards on both sides of the Carpathians, at
several points. As a further step toward their pacification, the
archbishop of Esztergom/Hungary, established missionaries in
Cumania, who converted the people to Christianity. The first bishop
had been installed at Milkó in 1227 and was followed by a new influx



of Magyars. Until 1410, five Hungarian bishoprics were erected. An
official census, carried out in the middle of the XVth century, found a
total population of 47,167 in Moldavia. Out of that number, over
20,000 were Catholic Hungarians. On the eve of World War II, the
Tchango-Magyars boasted 60 villages in the Tatros valley and 160
along the Sereth river.
When the northern corner of Moldavia, the district called Bukovina,
was annexed by the Aus-tro-Hungarian Monarchy, general András
Hadik transferred some Moldavian Hungarians into that district. Their
descendants, numbering 24,000 souls, were rapatriated into mother
land Hungary, during the second World War. All the other Tchango
Magyars continue to stay in the land, and are deprived of all cultural
facilities in their own language, not even having elementary
instruction, despite the fact that they are the native people of the land,
who settled there well before the arrival of the first Rumanians in the
XHIth century.
To sum up the sad history of the lost Hungarian tribes, we may say
that ethnographic factions, large or small, which broke away in Eastern
Europe from the main body of Hungarians, were able to retain their
identity for several centuries but most of them disappeared in the great
politico-military upheaval which was brought about by the Mongol
invasion in the XIIIth century.

____________________
1. We have reverted to the Aryan term, following the practice of many
scientists, who prefer it because its meaning is 'Men' (Wiro, Vir, Ar, Ur)
in most of the European languages (cf. P 130 p. 115).



2. The double racial origin of the Hungarians is first mentioned in the
Lacin language work of the sharp-eyed historian Deseritzky who said:
"Hunnos Magoresque gentem robustissimam et populosissimam
partim ex Japhet per Magog, partim ex Cham per Chus turn vero
Nemrothum fuisse propagatam et in unum coaluisse" (P 092 p. 79).
3. The head-shape is indicated by the cephalic index (CI). It is given in
percentage ratio (100) with the skull-width (W) and its greatest
length (L), from front to back, seen from above the head: CI= 100 X
(W:L). When its CI is 80.00 or more, the cranium is round, short or
brachy-cephalic. When CI is 75.00 or less, the cranium is long or
dolychocephalic. Between these two ranges are the meso-cephalic or
medium-headed elements.
4. E. Pittard: «Il me semble de plus en plus évident que les invasions
avares et magyares, qui apparaissent de beaucoup comme les plus
importantes, ne sont que deux
5. E. Pittard noticed the strong concentration of shortheaded Aryans
in the Ancient Near-East. He said: "En Asie, par exemple, parmi les
peuples divers que l'on a appelés les Aryens, et qui ont laissé le
souvenir de grandes civilisations, il y a beaucoup de brachycéphales,
d'Aryen brachycéphales" (P 103 p. 29).
6. It is important to keep in mind that, when our historical sources
mention the "dark" complexion of Kush, they do not always use this
word in a literal sense as 'black', but rather as opposed to white.
Further, the Kush must not be confused with Negroes, who are either
a distinct race, or a product of the jungle. Schuré insists upon this and
says: «Il faut en chercher le type supérieur non pas dans le Nègre
dégénéré, mais dans l'Abyssinien et le Nubien, en qui se conserve le
moule de cette race parvenue à son apogée» (P 114 p. 42).
7. In the first millenium A.D., almost every Eastern-Euro-pean nation



had some brownish-darkish complexioned ethnie elements in their
physical make-up. There were white and dark Huns, white and dark
Bulgars, white and dark Ugors, white and dark Chasars. It is
surprising that this all-important historical fact escaped the attention
of scientists, who persisted in believing that the adjectives White and
Dark, when employed in historical sources, in connection with ethnic
names, would signify the basic points: East and West, i.e. the
geographic position of the respective peoples. This is, of course, a
misinterpretation.
8. Chronicler Simon de Kéza accurately reflects the general feeling of
Hungarians against the dark coloured population by saying: "Gentes
siquidem in eadem (i.e. in Scythia) procreate otia complectuntur,
vanitatibus de-dite, nature dedignantis actibus venereis intendentes,
rapiñas amant, generaliter colore plus nigre quam albe" (P 120 I p.
252).
9. Former linguists and historians were inclined to consider the Kush
population as of Old Turkish extraction. It was, however, impossible to
find a fitting Turkish branch, or to determine the specific geographic
area where contacts between Hungarians and Turks might have taken
place. Above all, the beginning of the Kush-Hungarian relations
antedates the existence of any Turkish people. Therefore, the idea of
early Turkish-Hungarian connections had to be abandoned (see Prof.
Benko in P 009 p. 50).
10. The same opinion was expressed in a most recent German
language publication by Ferenc Kemény: "(Dass) das Ungarische
einerseits allen eurasischen Sprachen als Grundlage gedient hat,
andererseits eine echte Ursprache ist, deren Ursprung aus dem
heutigen Bestand derselben eindeutig erklaert werden kann (P 078 p.
115; see ibiden pp. 50, 61).



11. That Hungarian is an Aryan tongue par excellence, was stated
time and again by a number of linguists; most emphatically be Kristóf
Lukácsy, who said this: "When I say that Hungarian belongs to the
Aryan class of languages, I am summarizing the results of my
investigations of several years, conducted in the field of Hungarian
linguistics and antiquities" (P 092 p. 199).
12. "Aryan is the terminus technicus describing one of the great
language-groups extending from India to Europe" (P 038; see also
P133 and P 132). - Formerly, by mistake, the European languages
were collectively classified as Aryan. But their names do not include
the distinctive vocable Ari. Their kinship is based only upon the word
stock present in their substratum. — For the Aryan term, see also P
091 pp. 27-30; and Encycl. Britannica, ed. 1947, t. II p. 494.
13. "Ihm (Illitch-Switytch) war es gelungen, das System der
Lautentsprechungen zwischen den indoeuropäischen, den uralischen,
den altaischen... der khartweli-schen, den hamito-semitischen und
den dravidischen Sprachen zu erkennen. Diese Lautentsprechungen
beziehen sich auf Hunderte von Wortwurzeln einer eura-sischen
Ursprache deren man die Bezeichnung 'nostra-tisch' oder 'boreisch'
gab, — writes Dolgopolski in his German language account (P 042).
— See also the Hungarian complement to this study by Gy. Hary in
Valóság (Budapest, October 1976, p. 177). - Dolgopolski continues
thus: "Als Urheimat der boreischen Sprache, kommt nach allem, was
wir heute wissen, der Raum von Indien, und von Kaukasien bis zum
Persischen Golf, in Frage." - "Die boreische Sprachgemeinschaft muss
demnach in der mittleren Steinzeit, vor Beginn der Jungsteinzeit,
bestanden haben..." (P 042).
14. «Le nom du peuple Aryen reste jusqu'à présent sans explication
certaine» (P 091 p. 75).



15. Bird-headed statuettes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia
already from the time of the Flood (P 006 I p. 56). In Hungary too,
bird-headed bone-sticks have been found on several sites (P 050 p.
258).
16. Most of the Oriental place - and ethnic names with a Hungarian
meaning have been collected from the following five publications: P
013; P 021; P 024; P 044; and P 085. Some others were found in the
works of Herodotus, Dauzat, Uxbond, Saks, etc.
17. Toppeltinus: "...etiamnum vocantur Magori. Ingens populus et ipsi
armorum gloria inclytum regnum possi-dent" (P 092 pp. 98, 203).
18. L.A. Waddell comments Barat-Varsha thus: "The Land of the Barats
(Barat Varsha) a name synonymous with 'Barat Ana' or 'Land of the
Barats', which I have proved to be the original form of the name 'Brit
Ain' as given to Albion about 1100 B.C. by... the same Aryan race of
Barats... who civilized India and the Ganges valley" (P 132 bis p. 10);
see also the entry under 'Barata Varsha' in P 044).
19. "They called it /Egypt/ the land of Mezor ( = Magyar) and the
land of Cham / = Kush/ from their two ancestors, which the Greek
rendered Mesora and Chamia" (P 023 p. 298). — The same idea is
expressed in the following quotation "Throughout the early dynastic
period and the Old Kingdom /of Egypt/ Set (= the dark ruler ) and
Horus (the Aryan ruler) are represented as the two patron-deities of
the Monarchy" (John Van Saters, The Hyksos, London 1966 p. 98).
20. The transliteration of carved signs into Roman characters is
usually done 1. with capital letters for the graphically expressed
sounds; and 2. with small characters for the sounds supplied by the
decipherer. And 3. in our transliterations a dot is inserted between the
elements of every combined sound-sign. 4. The omitted consonants or
words are given in parentheses (), while 5. the broken-off and missing



signs are in brackets /.../.
21. The word Pogány 'Pagan' originates from the Latin Pagus 'Village'
and Paganus 'Villager', signifying 'People living in the countryside.' In
the Middle Ages, the same word was, however, used in a pejorative
sense to say 'uneducated, backward, despicable', especially when
speaking of non-Christian people. The alternative word for Pagan is
Heathen. It is probably derived from the Old Hungarian word Héth
'Seven', a shortened from of the expression 'Follower of the Seven
Great Gods.'
22. Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of the cruel
treatment King St. Stephen inflicted upon Thonuzoba who "stubbornly
adhering to his beliefs, was unwilling to become a Christian, and was
buried alive with his wife" (P 120 I p. 117). A similar cruel
punishment was imposed upon a woman, Raski by name, who was
prominent in a heathen uprising: "(She) was captured by the very
Christian King Béla and confined in prison until she ate her own feet,
and also died in the same place" (P 120 I p. 398). Persecutions of
adherents to the old faith continued until about the middle of the
XHIth century, the last dreaded inquisitor having been Johannes
Theuthon (+1252), commissioner of the Holy See to several Central
European states (P 047).
23. King Saint Stephen mentions in his gift-charter granted to the
nuns of Veszprém-Valley: "Ibi stat meta lapidea, que volgo Baluan
vocatur," "There stands a boundary-stone, called Idol by the local
population." ― Similarly, King András I ordered in his edict of 1047:
"Falsos deos abrogare et Simulacra demoliri", "to suppress the false
gods and to destroy the idols" (P 082 p. 367).
24. A witness who attended a meeting of wise-men, testified before
the Christian inquisitor by saying: "Wiseman Bansa climbed to the top



of a high ladder, stayed there for a while, chatting with God and, back
on earth, he foretold the future to his audience" (P 047 p. 56).
25. "Each time a Pharaoh was conceived, Ra was said to have returned
to earth to espouse the queen' (P 045 p. 50).
26. The corresponding passage by Anonymus reads thus: "matri eius
pregnanti per sompnium apparuit divina visio in forma Asturis que
quasi veniens earn gravidavit et innotuit ei quod de utero eius
egrederetur torrens et de limbis eius reges gloriosi propagarentur" (P
120 I p. 38).
27. "erat enim ipse Almus facie decorus sed niger, nigros habebat
oculos sed magnos, statura longus et gracilis, manus vero habebat
grossas et digitos prolixos" (P 120 I p. 38).
28. The grandson of Prince Arpad, Taksony, was of white complexion,
while Arpad's great-grandson took after him: "He had beautiful big
eyes and soft dark hair". Certain kings of the dynasty were of very
high stature, as, for example, St. Stephen, King András I, St. Ladislas
and King Béla III.
29. Prof. Gardiner states that the Egyptian Arpad may have been
"perhaps the first to become ruler upon earth over the autochthonous
Egyptians, after whom followed Osiris and the Horus" (P 052 p.
*110).
30. See the following references: P 052 I pp. *14 - *19, "103 and
*108; and P 026 II 94 - 100, 109, 153 and 374. -If the Sumerian name
for Earth was also Pat, Pot, the Sumerian ruler's title Pat-Esi (=H. Föld
Őse) also meant 'Land Ancestor' or 'Land Lord'.
31. Many rulers of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty had throne-names
with a clear Oriental meaning, and this explains why certain names



appear so often, like István (five times) and Béla (four times). In the
Old Hungarian spelling István or Están was the word for Isten 'God'.
Béla (in O.H. Bala, Baal, Bika) was the Syrian name for Great-God.
They were used in an abridged form, all bearing testimony that their
wearers were 'Living Gods', i.e. Gods on Earth, exactly as was the
practice in the Ancient Orient.
32. Babylon was surrounded by seven walls; the Mesopotamian
Ziggurat had seven floors; Mesopotamian noblemen wore seven
ruffled kilts; Egypt had seven great gods; the Egyptian Heaven had
seven divisions; the Hittite Empire (the Biblical Héth) started with the
fusion of seven lands; the Etruscan nation began with the federation
of seven cities; Rome was built on seven hills; etc. etc.
33. According to Prof. Áldásy, the double-cross cannot be considered
an apostolic cross; this latter was always a single cross (P 001 p. 63).
Thus, he indirectly admits the pre-Christian origin of this important
symbol.
34. The best edition of the medieval national chronicles is that of
Emericus Szentpétery, former professor at Budapest University (F 120
I-II).
35. "Et primus rex Scythiae fuit Magog filius Japhet, et gens ilia a
Magog rege vocata est Moger", ― writes Anonymus (P 120 I p. 35).
36. On these conflicting views see, particularly, the Chroni-con Pictum
(P 120 I pp. 243-250, and the Hungarian translation: P 053 pp. 35
37).
37. No Hungarian historian has taken notice until now that Egyptian
literature also know of a hunting hero, Onuris by name (like the
Hungarian Hunor), who had a mate called Mehit, 'lioness'. See the
somewhat confused passage in P 032 p. 227, which reads: "His



(Onuris') cult figure was a man wearing a long skirt, his feet poised
well apart, to enable him to aim a spear downwards at some
monstrous foe. His worship was centred in Thinis, a district which also
included Abydos." The Coffin Texts, III 334 j. are given as reference.
38. The original wording is thus: 'Ubi propter intemperiem illius zonae
sunt serpentes diversi generis, ranae velut porci, basilisci, et plura
animalia toxicata; tigris et unicornis ibi generantur." Where gold,
silver and pearls are also to be found (P 120 I p. 253. See also P 130
p. 164, where another location is suggested).
39. This is the opinion of many international authorities, like C.
Dawson who writes this: "It is certainly in the Danubian region that
we find (in Europe) the most complete and typical example of any
early peasant culture" (P 039 p. 53). And H. T. Waterbolk: "(Toward
3000 B.C.), the Hungarian Plain was a dominant centre which had
incorporated all the major achievements of the nuclear area in the
Near East and which had added to these an adaptation to the
European deciduous forest" (P 134).
40. for the westward diffusion of the Hungarian Neolithic and Bronze
Age civilizations see, in addition to the quoted references in the text,
in particular P 039 pp. 51 and 169.
41. In the light of the etymology given there, we have to abandon the
fantastic explanation of the Greek writers of the past, who believed
that the Italian Siculi were governed by One-Eyed Giants, interpreting
the Syc-Lo-Pe expression as being the Greek word Cyclops.
42. Thukydides relates that "the country owes its name of Italy to
Italus, a king of Sicel, so called." Now, Ital, as a Hungarian word,
means a 'drink', and Italos somebody 'fond of alcoholic drink'. The
explanation seems to be a fitting one, because the early Sicels are said
to have been fond of wine, which they drank in the Scythian fashion,



i.e. unmixed with water (P 067 Book VI cap. 84 and Book I cap. 106).
― Incidentally, the Greek name of Sungod, Apollo, is, in their
language, a Hungarian loan-word, made up with Pe + Ló, and the
prefixed definitive article A, whence A Pe-Lo, contracted into Apollo,
literally means 'The Chief Horse'.
43. Prof. Hood is reluctant to see actual writing upon the tablets: "But
do the Tartaria ( = Tatárlaka) tablets actually bear writing? Probably
not... It seems quite possible that they were merely an
uncomprehending imitation of more civilized peoples' written
records... a pretense by some illiterate barbarian to command the
magic embodied in an art he had witnessed but did not understand"
(P 068).
44. The calendar was a precious instrument in the hands of every
farming community of the Antiquity. It enabled the peasants to know
the most appropriate time to carry out certain important tasks, such as
plowing and sowing in particular and it was also useful for the timing
of religious festivals.
45. In Atlantic Europe, the observation of the various seasonal
positions of the Sun, in reference to the zodiacal star-clusters, was
made with the help of heavy megalith-ic structures (e.g. Stonehenge).
In the Danubian region, the more advanced microlithic structure
prevailed. This is the significant difference between the two halves of
Europe, although this has never been pointed out until now.
46. The step-by-step explanation of the inscription is thus: in the
second compartment we can distinguish the rising Sun, in Hungarian
A Nap. On its right side, the contours of a mouse (H.: Az Egér) are
visible, with its thin, long tail. The picture of this animal is here
because it is homophonous with the expression Az Égre, 'to the sky'.
So, the thus far deciphered words say this: A Nap az Égre 'The Sun to



the sky'. After that, we read the signs placed in the left and right
columns, saying: the cross sign iT, the crab A RÁK, followed by a sign
for the sound-group KUR/KOR, and finally the word for donkey IÁ. In
modern Hungarian: Itt a rákkor jö 'Comes at this spot in the Cancer
constellation'. The directive continues in the third compartment thus:
aN-aP Je-Le aR-áK öV-Be... 'The day's symbol in the Cancer zone is...
The complete message in better English reads: 'Here (at Tatárlaka) the
Sun appears on the horizon in the Cancer constellation on the day of...
― The homophony existing between 'Sky God' (Az Égúr) and the
mouse (Az Egér) was probably the origin of the never-explained
Oriental custom of keeping white mice in Sun-temples, as was the
case in Babylon and Egypt. The presence of these small animals was a
mean amongst a hundred others, to remind the believers that God
may hide himself in any of his creatures to watch over their behaviour.
47. «La science considére aujourd'hui que les Celtes ne constituent pas
une race, dans le sens propre du terme mais ont toujours été un
groupe de peuples, formánt un agrégat de types du point de vue
anthropologique» (P 057 p. 10; and see P 070 I p. X and P 132 p.
128).
48. The thesis of the linguistic unity of Celtic Europe is stressed by
almost every author, as for example P 037 p. 12; P 057 pp. 10-12; P
070 I pp. 49, 51. The hundred million Celts are mentioned in the
publication P 057 p. 11.
49. Henri Hubert consoles himself by saying: «Rien d'étonnant que ces
noms soient difficile á expliquer et que leur sens etymologique se soit
évanoui» (P 070 I p. 27 f.).
50. "Erat enim rex Ethele colore teter, oculis nigris et furiosis, pectore
lato, elatus incessu, statura brevis, barbam prolixam gum Hunnis
deferebat" (P 120 I p. 151).



51. Author Agathias writing about the Hunnorum Gens says this: "Hi
vero omnes communiter Scythae et Hunni vocabantur, privátim
autem, secundum nationes alii aliter ex patria cuique et usita
appellatione nominaban-tur", quoted by P 092 p. 130.
52. "Mensa erat tota aurea, vasa etiam coquinaria aurea erant",
records Simon de Kéza (P 120 I p. 262).
53. Clenodia aurea que a tempore regis Ungariae Attila et ab aliis
successoribus suis usque nunc in Ungaria fuerant conservata" (P 099
p. 187 f.).
54. It should be noted, once again, that the ancient royal Egyptian
symbols also included the bird, the whip and the bee.
55. Incidentally, ancient Egyptian kings had the same custom: "The
warrior kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties were pleased when
the court scribes related in commemorative inscriptions how their
lords raged and roared like lions as they mounted their chariots and
set out to crush the foolish enemy" (P 026 I p. 25 f.)
56. "Sie besassen keine Sprache, sondern stiessen kurze, rauhe Laute
aus, wie Tiere auf der Flucht" (P 113 p. 17).
57. "Sie sind treuer and harter als die Germanen, sie kennen nichts als
den König" (P 113 p. 130).
58. "Der Name Attila ist heute zweifelsfrei als Germanisch 'Váterchen'
erkannt", Die Presse, Stuttgart, 20, May 1975.
59. The Swiss anthropologist E. Pittard was one of the first scientists
to suspect the close affinity of the early inhabitants of Hungary. He
said: «I1 est probable, á voir les caractéres morphologiques des
habitants de la Hongrie, que parmi les peuples qui arrivaient de l'Est,



il y en avait plusieurs qui étaient puisés aux mémes fonds ethniques
que les Magyars eux-mémes» (P 103 p. 341).
60. Several examples can be listed to prove that Horse (Lau) was used
to say Ra, the Sungod. In the Zagros mountains, to the east of
Mesopotamia, there was a small country called Lauristan (<H.: Ló-Ur
Isten), 'Land placed under the protection of the Horse-Lordgod' i.e.
Sungod. It was the unique task of the Scythians who lived in that
country to raise horses for the Persian armies. Their popular art was
also overladen with horse representations. — Another example: The
Armenian bishop, Israyel, who travelled into the land of the Huns and
described their beliefs, said this: "The Huns worshipped their highest
divinity in the form of a giant warrior, mounted on horseback" (P 081
p. 65). - The Hungarian AU sound usually changes into 0, as in the
city-name of Iglau, which is in modern Hungarian, Igló.
61. Originally, the eastern border lands of Germany (the future
Austria) were a creation of Frankish rulers. They were re-established
later, as duchies of Carinthia (976), Carniola (1040), Styria (1055)
and Ostmark (1156).

THE HUN HUNGARIANS
1. The Roman and Germanic influence upon the ethnographic
conditions in the Carpatho-Danubian basin
1. The peaceful penetration of Magyar-speaking Oriental tribes into
the Carpatho-Danubian region was interrupted after the Scythian and
Celtic periods and was replaced by armed interventions from the
West. First came the Romans, an imperialist people. After having
created a solid basis on the Apennine peninsula, they gradually
extended their domination over the entire Mediterranean area during
the second and first centuries B.C. Thereafter, for growing security
and economic reasons, they extended the frontiers of their Empire up
to the Danube, which meant, for Hungary, the occupation of her
western province, Transdanubia. After a difficult and long war (from
12 B.C. to 9 A.D.) they besieged it and about fifty years later
converted the conquered land into a Roman province, under the name
of Pannónia. They ruled this province for about four hundred years,
and then gradually handed it over to the Huns, between 409 and 433.
What interests us, regarding the Roman rule of Pannónia, is to
ascertain what had happened to the large Magyar-speaking population
there. In that respect, we must first recall that the Roman conquest
was prompted by strategic considerations and its military character
was predominant up to the very end. Above all, the Romans wanted to



build a strong military barrier along the Danube. Secondly, the
province's Roman governors were not as blood-thirsty and ruthless as
was Julius Caesar in Gaul. Thanks to these circumstances, the Roman
conquest was neither followed by wholesale massacres of the
inhabitants, nor by the extermination of the upper classes, nor by the
colonization of the land by a Latin-speaking population. The former
tribal structure of the society was maintained, including local
administration (P 087 pp. 112, 117). The legions which were keeping
watch on the Danube, and the various auxiliary personnel employed
for guarding the military roads were mostly manned by a local
population, including their commanders. Moreover, what was no less
important: the Romans did not suppress the native beliefs. Thus, once
the war was over, life, on the whole, followed its ancestral course.
Taking all that into account, our scholars evaluated the effect of Roman
rule in Pannónia, from an ethnographic point of view, as harmless.
Those who studied Hungarian life in Pannónia under Roman rule
more closely, have pointed out certain linguistic facts which evidence
the survival of the Hungarian language. The very name of the land
Pannónia, for example, is a Hungarian compound with Pan and Hon
(=H.: Fenn-Hon) meaning 'Upper Land'. The most important city was
Savaria, so named after the Sungod (cf. Savi-tra, Savarna, P 044). In
that city, God was worshipped in a great temple, which had an
immense Sundisc above its altar. The present-day village of Szabar,
near ancient Savaria, probably retains the ancient city's names.
For the survival of the Hungarian language under the Roman rule, it is
highly significant that the Roman emperors, coming from Pannónia,
used Hungarian throne-names, as did Had-Ri-Anus (117-138), Aur-Eli
Anus (270-275), Val-Eri-Anus (253-260), and Sev-Erus (193-211). In
these names the Hungarian component -Anus (= Honős) often
appears, meaning 'Country Ancestor', or the word -Erus (Urős) 'Divine
Ancestor'. It is not surprising to find so many Hungarian traces in



Pannónia, since the political and military centre of the Roman Empire
was, in the third and fourth centuries A.D., no longer in Rome, but in
Pannónia and Illyria instead. During this time, these provinces, or
rather their inhabitants, supplied the best soldiers, governors, and
emperors, and also 'Roman' virtue.
After the conquest of Pannónia, the Romans conquered the eastern
part of Hungary as well and emperor Trajan converted it to another
Roman province named Dacia. The emperor personally conducted the
military operations (101-105). The occupation of this land was
actually prompted by economic reasons: the Romans wanted to lay
their hands upon the abundant supply of gold, silver, copper and salt
which was mined there. Dacia's occupation was, however, short lived,
lasting about a century and a half. Indeed, the province had to be
abandoned in 271, when Roman personnel was evacuated and
withdrawn to the southern shore of the Danube. The three most
important Dacian cities, Sar-Mizegeth-Usa, Napo-Ca, and A-Pu-Lum
have clear Hungarian meanings. The first name would be in present
spelling Sár-Mezőket-Ásó (city) 'Where gold fields are dug', the second
Nap-Kő 'Sun City', and the third A Fő Ló (városa) '(City) of the
Principal Horse', also a Sun city.
The Roman never subjected the mountainous northern section of
Hungary, nor the great Central Plain, between Pannónia and Dacia, to
their rule. The tribes living in that part of the land maintained their
independence. So, Roman domination passed without vital harm in
Dacia as well. But, by dismembering the Carpatho-Danubian land into
three parts, they retarded the unification of the diverse social groups into
a single nation, a process which had been going on since Scythian times.
Thus it happened that the territorial re-unification of the entire
Carpathia area and the building of a nation befall the next generation of
great leaders: King Attila and Prince Arpad.



2. Shortly after the Roman Empire's entry into the Carpathian basin,
Germanic tribes also began their penetration into the land. They started
from their northwestern homeland Scandia (Scandinavia) pushing
eastwards on the East-European table-land until they had reached the
River Don in the third century A.D. They were called Goths, and
formed two separate groups, the Ostro-Goths and the Visi-Goths. A
third Germanic tribal federation, the Gepids, was formed inside the
Carpathians, in Transylvania, above the Maros river, as far as the
Tisza.
The appearance of Germanic tribes in Eastern and Central Europe
filled the Romans with fear, so they encouraged the Huns, who were
also threatened, into action. The tense situation provoked the armed
intervention of the Huns in 375. After this, Germanic rule crumbled
away and the Huns gained control over all eastern and central
Europe. This is all well known in history, so that we do not need to
discuss it. But less known is the ethnic build-up of the Germanic tribes
in question. It is, indeed, a false assumption that the Germanic tribes
were as fully Germanic in Eastern and Central Europe as they were
when invading continental Europe from Scandinavia around Christ's
birth. The explanation is obvious: when the Germanic tribes started
for the distant adventure, they usually travelled without women folk
and therefore strongly mixed with local population during their
wanderings. That had the effect, that within three or four generations,
they were a completely different people from the one that set out. The
following short analysis will show how the Germanic tribes mixed
with Hungarians when they reached the domain of the Magyar ethnic
body.
The name Gepida was given to the confederation of Germanic tribes
which occupied northeastern Hungary. It has no accepted etymology
in the Germanic language, but has in Hungarian, where Gyep-i Ta
means '(Men) of the Grass-Land', where the Gepids actually lived. And



in the case of the Visi-Goths, which name is supposed to signify 'West
Goths' in the Germanic language, the Hungarian gives again a more
plausible explanation. In it Visi (in to-day's Hungarian Vizi) means
'Those who live near water courses', which was again true of the
Goths. The Germanic ethnic identification symbols were also taken
over from the local population, particularly the eagle, typical symbol
of the steppe population, and also birds in general. We should also not
forget that Gothic script, the so-called Runen, was a simplified Magyar
carved script. Its German name originated from the Hungarian word
róni 'to carve'. Thus, we should agree with the statement of Gyula
László, according to which "the scant upper class of the Goths, the
conquering layer, underwent an almost complete transformation
under the impact of local traditions and customs" (P 087 pp. 161
164). The modified social structure of the Goths and Gepids was one
of the main reasons why they accepted to stay in the Carpathian land
so readily even after the Hun conquest, faithfully serving their new
king Attila. All that considerably modifies the image we had of the
migration of the Germanic peoples, at least in the sector of
southeastern Europe. It altogether confirms that the aboriginal
Hungarians could keep their own ethnic identity unchanged. And that
was the most important feature of the Middle Danube basin on the eve of
the coming of the Huns.
2. The coming of the Huns
The Huns emerged in history as an Oriental people living on the
pastures of the Oxus river valley, to the south of the Aral Sea.
However, in the second century A.D., most of them had already
skirted the southern end of the Caspian Sea and were in possession of
the land above the Caucasus mountains up to the mouth of the Don
river, the steppeland of former Scythia. Their westward move was
prompted by fatal climatic changes which transformed their cradle
land (Touran) into a semi-desert. Increasing temperatures resulted in



a considerable reduction of the water supply and the grass of the
fields vanished. Thus the Huns, living from animal husbandry, had to
move and look for new grazing land. At the same time, as just
mentioned, Germanic tribes were advancing eastwards on the great
European Plain, by occupying more and more pasture, until they too
had reached the river Don and came in direct contact with the Huns.
Alarmed by their double misfortune, the Huns felt that their very
existence was being threatened and that provoked their violent
reaction. Under their first great king Balamber, they attacked the
Ostro-Goths, their nearest adversaries, and swiftly broke their power.
The Ostrogothic ruling class took refuge in Pannónia and proceeded to
Italy a little later. The bulk of the Gothic population, however,
submitted to the Huns and was incorporated into their politico
military system as a separate entity under its own leaders. The next
Germanic tribal federation, the Visi-Goths, located on the northern
bank of the Lower Danube, seeing the defeat of their brethren, offered
no resistance, but gave up their land, crossed the Danube and entered
into the Roman Empire. Thus, the Huns, with a single sweeping
action, arrived at the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in 375
A.D.
Immediately thereafter, the Huns began planning the occupation of
the last western segment of the great Eurasian steppeland, the
Carpathian Lowland, inside the mountainous arc, by concluding pacts
and alliances with their kindred tribes: the Yazigues in the Danube
Tisza quadrangle, the Skirs (= Sikeli) in the western half of the
country, the Carpodari in Upper Hungary, as well as with the Romans
themselves, whose famous general Aetius became their most
important ally. By virtue of these multiple alliances, the Huns gained
control of the whole basin inside the Carpathians, without employing
military force. Since the land was given over to Hun sovereignty
peacefully, without war, and with the blessings of Rome, the local



population had no particular reason to expeet hardship. It remained
intact and offered its services to the Hun king, a friend of Rome. The
Huns set up their permanent head-quarters in the heart of the land, at
the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros, wherefrom King Oktar (
+ 430), King Ruga ( + 434) and thereafter King Attila (+453)
governed their extensive empire. Thus, with the coming of the Huns,
Roman and Germanic dominions in Central Europe were liquidated and
the aborigines liberated.
Aetius continued to court the Huns, even after their installation in
Hungary, encouraging them in their westward advance, in order to
ease the Germanic pressure on the northern borders of the Roman
Empire. For the Huns, the prospect of a possible extension of their
sway upon the whole of Europe was an alluring offer, but, as it turned
out, a miscalculation. King Attila was unable to win a clear victory in
the great battle at Mauriacum, near Troyes, France, in 451. The
immense efforts this war required in men and material, and the
authoritarian manner Attila handled his subalterns, overstrained the
socio-political structure of his realm. So, when Attila suddenly passed
away in 453, his empire crumbled, in large part because of the
intrigues and rebellion of the Germanic tribes. Attila's sons were
defeated in the struggle for the succession (455) and returned with
their clans and kinsmen to Scythia, the tract of land above the Black
Sea, beyond the Carpathian ranges. They did not, however, forget
their ancient grandeur and Prince Csaba, the youngest son of Attila, as
soon as he was back in the old country, began to spread the idea of an
armed return to Pannónia (= Hungary), to take revenge upon the
Germans, whom they considered as the main artisans of their defeat.
On his death-bed, he bound his people by oath, to return to Hungary,
as soon as they had gathered enough strength, to rebuild a Hun state.
Thus, the Huns did not disappear as it was sometimes surmised in
certain historical books. They stayed in the immediate neighbourhood,



waiting until the clock would strike the hour of their return. This
moment arrived in 568.
At that time, a strong federation had come into being with the fusion
of two great tribes: the A vari and Chunni consisting mostly of white
Huns. The name Avari (< H.: A vár-i) means 'He who comes from an
embanked stronghold', and Chunni (< H.: Hun-i, i.e. Hon-i), Huns. J.
Thury, a Hungarian historian, established that 37 different sources
identify the Avars ethnically as Huns (P 059 pp. 113,128). In the
Carpathian basin, they mainly occupied the Great Central Plain and
Transdanubia and also considerable parts of present-day Austria and
Dalmatia. The Avars kept their empire and their independence until 796,
when they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who
destroyed their State, whereby the pendulum swing, once again,
westward.
3. The ethnic identity of the Huns
The true identity of the Huns has not yet been clearly established: "We
know nearly nothing about their early history" and "the history of
Attila is still to be written" (P 061 p. 127). Our evidence on the
anthropological build-up of this nation is scanty, because the Huns
cremated their dead, thereby leaving no direct anthropological traces
of them. Hence, what we know about them comes mostly from
second-hand records. In contemporary and later accounts, the Huns
are said to be of mixed origins, like all nations with an Oriental
background. A major proof of this, as is usually pointed out, was their
skin colour which was generally brownish, although there were typical
white Huns as well. Their colour difference subsisted even in the
fourth and fifth centuries, which indicates that the fusion of the two
racial elements of this people had not yet been achieved at that time.
This state of their ethnic evolution explains why they were not only
called by their common name Huni, but also by other names which



emphasize their racial origin. They were called Kush when their
darkish colouring was more evident (P 092 pp. 14 f., 19-22), and
Aryans (< H.: Uri, Ari), when the white complexion predominated.
King Attila is described in the chronicles as a short-statured, darkish
complexioned man, of haughty walking.(50)
The various appellations of the Huns all have some significance in the
Hungarian language. Their most frequent Huni (< H.: Hon-i) name,
often written without H as Unni, Uni, means 'He who lives in the same
land', i.e. who is a native of the country, a compatriot. It is a
geographic and political term, irrespective of racial origin, as were
also the previously analysed names of Magyar, Hungar, Siculi and
Kelti. Thus, the main connecting link amongst all these peoples was
their common Hungarian language and their identical Oriental origin.
Therefore, they mixed easily, once they were placed under a same
sovereignty. And there can be no mistake if Attila is referred to as the
King of Hungary (rex Hungáriáé), since the Huni were considered as
Hungarians (Huni sive Hungari).
In addition to their general names (Huns, Kush, Hungarians) the
various factions of this people also came under local denominations.
(51) These secondary names were mainly noticed after the collapse of
the Hun Empire, when several smaller political entities came into
being. These names usually included the distinctive word -Ág- Ur
'Ruler of the branch so and so'. Examples: Kutzi-Ág-Űr, Hun-Ág-Ur, Sár
Ág-Ur. The ethnic identity of the Huns is nevertheless best evidenced
by their own written records, which we discovered and which we are
now going to analyse in more detail.
4. Hun-symbols and written records
It is often assumed that the Huns were an illiterate, barbaric people
who left no written records. This opinion actually stems from the



inability of scholars to identify and decipher their script. In fact, as
shown below, the Huns bequeathed us with a considerable amount of
written records, most of which turned up in Hungary, the one-time
centre of their vast empire. Apart from sources of archaeological
provenance, diplomatic records also mention their ability to write and
to read. We have, in this respect, the rare testimony of Priscos Rhetor,
one of the most credible observers of the Huns, who led an embassy to
the court of King Attila. He mentions in his report that the King
requested the extradition of certain fugitive Huns, whose names he
read out in his presence from small wooden sticks, from the Byzantine
emperor. Another proof of the Huns' writing ability is the fact that the
incised or carved script was always called a "Hun writing", "Hun
letters" and "Alphabet of the Huns" in Hungary. The legend about
illiterate Huns must be abandoned.
Most existing Hun inscriptions have gold as supporting material and
as such display a solemn character. But the daily records which Priscos
Rhetor himself had mentioned were made on wood or on other
perishable material, which deteriorated and are now lost for ever.
Another preliminary question to be answered is whether the existing
Hun inscriptions, especially those engraved upon expensive materials,
could have really belonged to them at all. We have no reason to doubt
this, since our historical sources are positive in stating that the Hun
kings were, in general, fond of gold, like all Oriental rulers. We read
in these records that Attila's dining table was made of solid gold, and
his cooking dishes were also of gold.(52) The same sources mention
the existence of a huge Hun golden treasure, which later on became
the property of the Hungarian kings by law of succession and was
always kept in Hungary, at the royal court. The treasure included the
legendary sword of Attila, the so-called Sword of God, implying
Attila's divine origin. Moreover, Hungarian medieval charters certify
that Ottokár II of Bohemia was asked to restitute all the gold to the



King of Hungary, which his grandmother, Ann of Masovia, unlawfully
carried away from Hungary to Bohemia. Amongst these precious
jewels "was an expensive gold dish, adorned with the finest and most
beautiful precious stones, as well as many other famous jewels, which
were kept in Hungary from the time of Attila, king of Hungary, and his
successors until now."(53) The listed data dispel even the slightest
doubt one may have that Attila had been the owner of gold dishes and
other precious jewels, which were inscribed.
On the following pages we will show a few Hun symbols, to begin
with, which were used for the purpose of identifying the ruler by
means of homo-phony, i.e. the pictorial method of writing which was
common to all Oriental rulers during Antiquity. Attila's best known
such symbol was the Ast-Ur bird, whose image he wore on his shield.
This word sounds like Est-Ura, 'Ruler of the West'. This title may have
originated from the time when he was only ruling the western half of
the Hun Empire, his brother Bleda having been in charge of the
eastern part. Furthermore, Attila was also called God's Whip, which is
another play on sound for the same title, whip being Ostor in
Hungarian, homophonic with Est-Ur. Finally, a widely used Hun badge
was the stylized insect having the outlines of a bee (H.: Méh), which
identified its bearer (Ur, Ar), as Méh-Ar, i.e. Mahar or Magyar.(54)
Another group of Hun-identifying objects consisted of quadrupeds:
mostly dogs, foxes, and wolves. They were used as totems,
designating the clan from which they had originated. On the basis of
such assumed names, certains Huns could have considered themselves
as "Sons of the Dog" or "Sons of the Fox". King Ruga was probably 'Fox'
(H.: Róka), while King Oktar may have been 'Mr. Dog' (H.: A kutya
ur). The speech of the Huns, especially their battle-cry, was said to
resemble "the roaring of lions" (P 099 pp. 64, 147, 178).(55)
The author has deciphered several of the Hun inscriptions which are



engraved upon gold dishes, found at Nagy-Szent-Miklós, to the south
of the river Maros, which was the central district of the Hun Empire.
The cache was discovered in 1791 and yielded 23 pieces (dishes,
juges, goblets, etc.), all made of solid gold, weighing altogether 9,925
gr. The commodities were probably not for everyday use, because they
are conserved in almost perfect condition, without any trace of wear
or tear. It is likely that the purpose of these jewels was rather to
preserve important historical messages for the progeny, like royal
records. In addition to the individual inscriptions, five richly adorned
vessels (numbered 9, 10, 17, 22 and 23) bear an identical short script.
It always reads from right to left and was written in memory of the
goldsmith who made the decorations: pictures and interwoven
figures. The script (Fig. 32) reads in Hungarian thus: áR-U Ké-Pé.T 1
T.eR.éK U.N CSi-Ná.Ta, in present Hungarian orthography: Árú képét
egy derék hun csinálta, in English: 'The adornment of this article was
made by a skilled Hun.'

gold tray. Treasure of Nagy-Szent-Miklós, Hungary.



A longer inscription appears on a gold tray (Fig. 33), marvellously
adorned with a Tree of Life (genealogical tree), flanked on both sides
by two stylized attendant animals. In the higher ranking position there
are two dog-like creatures with pointed ears, and on the second one
are two quadripeds with birds' beaks. The picture may point out the
two major Magyar-speaking peoples of Hungary at that time: Huns
and Magyars. The one line inscription below the picture reads from
right to left and is transliterated thus: aD-iSZ.eN iR-T eR.aN-O.Ni
Ro.Ko.N-oK E.L-aT-Ne-Fe-Ke E.L-T-eK J-U Fó-T, in present Hungarian
spelling it would be thus: A díszen irt Irán-honi rokonok állatnevekkel
éltek; jó volt. Its meaning: 'The Iranian relatives represented on the
ornament, used to live under assumed animal names; that was an
advantage.'
The longest inscription shown here is engraved upon a golden dish of
which there are two identical ones (Fig. 34). Its distinctive feature is
an equilateral cross-sign, placed in the middle of the dish, and is
surrounded by a circular inscription. It was executed with great care,
no doubt because it was King Oktar's royal seal, bearing his full title.
We shall not enter into discussing the complicated meaning of the
cross-sign, but only of the script itself, which reads counter-clockwise,
starting at the 12 o'clock position. The transliteration of the signs is
thus: Ne.Te.T.I-K uN Ki.Rá O.K.T.áR O.R-SZ-E-EGe A.Ra-K Jo.K-oN Ve
Te P-A.Ra-To.K-T-O(l) Po.N-T.I-aK I.SZ.T(er) Vi-Té.Ki-E-K O.Ra-Li-aK
Tó.T-oK U-RA. In full Hungarian: Negyedik hun király Oktár országa.
Örök jogon vette barátoktól. Pontiak, Ister vidékiek, Uraliak, Tótok ura.
In English: 'Realm of the fourth Hun king Oktar. He bought it from
friends by hereditary right. He is the ruler of those living above the
Pontus (= the Black Sea), in the Ister (= Danubian) region, in the
Ural area and of the Slavonic peoples.'



Fig. 34. The great seal of King Oktár the Hun with legend in
Hungarian.
The last Hunnic inscription we will be discussing was found outside
Hungary. It is incised on the pendant of a necklace found in Wolfheim,
Rhein-land. The name of the village where it was found, signifies the
'Dwelling Place of Wolves', a typical Hun designation. The relic comes,
in all probability, from a group of Huns who found refuge there after
the collapse of their Empire. The message on it was prepared with
philological precision (Fig. 35) and is transliterated thus: E.N-G-aR
N.E-N-eT.oL EL-O.N-A.N-aK Na.T.A-P.A Ungár nénitől Ilonának,



Nagyapa 'From Aunt Ungar to Helen, Grandfather.'
The contemporary written documents of the Huns constitute the decisive
evidence that these people were literate, having strong cultural relations
with ancient Egypt, and spoke Hungarian. Their records repeatedly say
that they originated from the Ancient Near East (Iran), and had
acquired their Carpathian land peacefully, by virtue of diplomatic
accords.

5. The bad image of the Huns in Western Europe
After all we have said about the Huns, the question that comes to
mind is how could they have had such bad press in western Europe to
this day. This hatred is focussed mainly upon King Attila, the most
brilliant figure of his race, secondly, upon the Hun people themselves.
As is disclosed from the analysis regarding this subject (P 099 and P
072), chronicler Jordanes, a man of Gothic descent, started the
defamation. It was he who invented the tale that Attila was not a
human being, but rather a monster, born from the love of a dog and a
witch and had a doglike appearance (canis aspersus), with pointed ears.
This monster image has come into circulation, in all probability,
through misinterpretation of the Hun custom of using animal symbols
to indicate their tribal or national appurtenance. So, when the Huns
said that they originated from a wolf or a dog, the naive western
priests and chronicle-writers took these expressions literally, and



justified their abhorrent image with the Huns' own words.
The Huns' monster image was confirmed by a second feature, namely
that God had selected the Hun king to fulfill the ungrateful mission to
be God's whip (flagellum Dei), a kind of Anti-Christ, to punish,
especially the Latin peoples, for their wickedness and crimes. This
second gossip originated obviously from the misinterpretation of the
Huns' original symbol, the whip, which in their symbolism, meant
simply that Attila was the ruler of West, as explained above. Thus the
whip in the hand of Attila had as little to do with a punishing mission
as the one in the hands of Egyptian Pharaohs. If Jordanes, this first
western propagandist, could have had the opportunity to travel
throughout the Hun Empire, he probably would have avoided
spreading so much inconsistency amongst his countrymen. Herodotus,
almost a thousand years earlier, did his reportage on the Scythians
more conscientiously. He spared no trouble and travelled to Olbia, on
the Black Sea shore, to gather firsthand information. The description
of Priscos Rhetor is similarly much more accurate because he had met
Attila personally.
Ordinary Huns were also heaped with slander. It was asserted that
they were subhuman beings, the descendants of Scythian witches and
of unspecified devils, and that their way of life consisted only of
looting, perpetrating robberies and killings. And their speech? Oh,
they did not have any, their mouth could only give out short and
inarticulate sounds like fleeing animals.(56) This latest Hun-feature
also originated from the miscomprehension of the metaphor,
according to which the Hun battle-cry was likened to the roaring of
lions, as the ancient Egyptian kings have done when in battle. To sum
up, all the interpretations the Westerners invented reflect their naivety,
lack of experience and a great deal of bad faith.
The Hun armies never sacked Rome, the holy city of Christendom,



although they could have done so in 452, having arrived at the gates
of the City. In the western interpretation this was not due to Attila's
orders, but to a miracle: the apostles Peter and Paul appeared with
shining sabres above Attila's head, and this sight frightened the
would-be robber who fled. Thereafter, the lucky city was, however,
repeatedly robbed and burned by Germanic tribes. First by the Visi
Goths of Alaric in 410 A.D., and then by the Vandals of Gaiseric in
455, when the two saintly apostles failed to pull out their sabres to
chase away the real robbers. But such arguments would carry no
weight with the makers of myths who persisted in their belief that
with the Huns, the scum of Earth had inundated Europe.
The traditional Hun-phobia of medieval western writers clouded the
clairvoyance of the modern historians as well who were unable to
reason otherwise and saw in Attila the prototype of the Barbar: the
uncut, savage man who built nothing and destroyed everything for the
sake of destruction. They forget that the mass-murderer Julius
Caesar was the true scourge of God in Antiquity, and that the words
Vandal and Vandalism, were not a Hunnic, but of western origin.
Fortunately, Hungarian historians have never accepted the Hun-image
elaborated by their western colleagues. For them, King Attila was the
first great Magyar ruler in Europe, who liberated their forefathers
from the western yoke, stopped both Roman and Germanic
penetration, and rolled back the invaders of the Carpatho-Danubian
basin thus preserving the precious ethnic and political equilibrium in
central Europe. Hungarian historians, also, did not ignore the military
genius of Attila, and stated emphatically, that the Huns had not only a
highly developed culture, but that they had doubtlessly surpassed
western civilization which was at that time, in its darkest "dark age"
(decadence of the Roman and Byzantine empires). Even Charlemagne,
the great Frankish ruler, could not sign his name.



We have to admit, however, that the western historians of today are
making efforts to form a more truthful view of the Huns, bringing it
more into harmony with our modern scholarly standards. After this
cleansing operation, all the incredible features of the Hun-portrait
have been discarded, notably those concerning the Huns' monstruous
origin, their animal language and their so-called earthly mission. But
it will be some time until past conventional wisdom is replaced by the
results of modern research. As an illustration of this process, we read,
in a recent publication, the admission that "the threat which they (the
Huns) had posed to western civilization has probably been
exaggerated" (P 104 p. 69). German authors recognize that the Huns,
as body-guards, were more reliable than their own fellow countrymen.
(57) It shall also be noted that, after all, the central figure of the
German sagas was precisely Attila (cf. Nibelungenlied). Germans even
want to claim that Attila was one of their kinsmen, his name being a
Germanic word, meaning something like "Daddy".(58) It is really high
time that the distorted image of the Huns, this dark blot on western
historiography, make way for some more serious consideration, wherein
the great-power status of the Huns and their world-empire are
acknowledged and appreciated at their proper value.

THE MAGYAR HUNGARIANS
1. Massive influx of Magyars into the Carpathian Land and the
birth of Hungary-I
After the collapse of the Hun rule in Hungary (453), the major
Germanic tribes of the country — Goths, Gepids and Longobards (the



latter since 526 only), — set up individual principalities and quarreled
violently amongst themselves. The Longobards were striving for
predominance but, not having the necessary strength to achieve it,
asked a Hun faction of Eastern Europe to help them defeat their rivals.
With the support of this Magyar tongued faction called Avari (Avars),
the Longobards drove out the Gepids, but felt so insecure in their
domain that they deemed it advisable to evacuate Hungary. They
actually fled to Italy in 568, together with their families. After that, the
Avar Hungarians set up their own kingdom (568-803) in the entire
Carpathian area. At the beginning, the Avar Kingdom extended from
the Don in the East to the Enns in the West. Later it shrank and
covered only the Carpathian basin, the Vienna Plain and the
Bohemian Plateau.
There was much speculation about the ethnic identity of the Avars.
But it seems certain that they already spoke Hungarian when they first
appeared on the scene of history. Their name Avari (< H.: A vár-i)
means, indeed 'Those who live in enclosures (Rings)'. And the throne
name of their first great ruler, under whose leadership they entered
the Carpathian land, was Baján (< H.: Be-Jön), a homophon of 'He
who comes in'. More information is available about the ethnic identity
of the second Avar ethnic wave (670), composed of "White
Hungarians", as is definitely stated in the Russian chronicle of Nestor.
The vastness of Magyar human material that settled thus in Hungary
at that time is reflected by the great number of their graves which
have been excavated, 40,000. The newcomers occupied the edges of
the Great Central Plain, and Transdanubia, and also southern
Hungary, i.e. the best arable lands of the country. The seat of their
government was in Györ (< H.: Gyürü = 'Ring'), a strategically
located and well fortified stronghold at the confluence of the Raba
river and the Danube. The Hungarian chroniclers never use the term
Avar when speaking about them. They call them simply Hungarians,



as do the majority of West-European chronicles as well. They add, at
best, a few adjectives for the sake of a clarification, like "Avars who
are called Hungarians" {Avari qui dicuntur Ungari); "Avars who are
called Huns and Hungarians as well" (Avari qui et Huni sive Hungari).
By the same token, un Avar king is mentioned with the title of "King of
Hungary". The latter has been a famous ruler because his daughter
Berthe became the wife of Pepin and subsequently the mother of
Charlemagne. The quoted data clearly suggest that from 670 onwards,
the Magyars already formed a united nation in the Car-patho
Danubian basin and had an organized State headed by kings. That
was a historical event, and this explains why Prince Arpad could set
up a smoothly working State-apparatus so easily after his entry into
the land. For him, the help of the Hungarians in the Rings was
inevaluable.
The Avar-Hungarian kingdom lasted for about two and a half
centuries. Afterwards, the reorganized Frank Empire resumed past
Germanic expansion toward the East under the half-Hungarian
Charlemagne (771-814) who organized a series of razzias against
Hungary between 796 and 803 and destroyed its central government.
Charlemagne was not much interested in territorial gains. He
preferred to loot the Rings, where the nation's treasures — gold, silver
and precious stones — were guarded. On a single occasion, for
example, he 'collected' so much treasures that 14 wagons were needed
to cart them away from Hungary. Chronicler Eginard (Einhard)
commented on that big haul by saying: "According to human memory,
there was no earlier war in which the Franks have become as wealthy
as just now; for until now, they were poor" (cf. P 098 pp. 113, 240).
As regards the Magyar population of Avar-Hun-gary, it survived the
loss of their State and continued to live almost undisturbed. The
largest administrative unit which continued to function was that



located around Lake Fertő, a rather swampy region in western
Hungary. It was last mentioned in 873. A second surviving mini-state
was the realm of Tudun, in Upper Hungary. This one endured until the
coming of Arpad in 895. The harmful consequence of Frankish
incursions into Hungary was the creation of a politico-military vacuum
in a so vitally strategic part of Central Europe, which caused a lot of
inconveniences both to the local population and to the Germans as
well. Therefore, emissaries were sent to the East-European Arpad
Hungarians even by the German king Arnulf who urged them to come
in to help stabilize the situation. The craving for a new unifier was
fulfilled in 895, with the entry on the scene of Prince Arpad. His coming
opened a new chapter in Central Europe's history.
2. Hungary's ethnographic and political conditions in the IXth
century
1. In the previous chapters we have explained how Magyar-speaking
ethnic groups continuously poured into the Carpathian land, ever
since Neolithic times. They came in successive waves, in increasing
numbers and under various denominations: Magyars, Székely, Kush,
Scythians, Celts, Huns, Avars, etc. Their common starting point was
the Ancient Near-East and they were linked by ethnic, cultural and
linguistic ties. This morphological coherence of the early Hungarians
is probably the most important discovery in our recent historical
science.(59) Now, it will be interesting to find out whether the earliest
population and its descendants were still evident in the IXth century,
at the eve of Arpad's coming.
A first indication of the presence of Magyars is that the mountain-,
river- and village-names they had imparted to the geographic features
of the land were still all in use. Furthermore, their identification
symbols: the bird, the bee, the lion and the ram were also deeply
embedded in the folklore, which was strongly impregnated with



suncult and with general Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Syrian
connections. All that would be impossible to explain without the
continuous presence of the same population and, what is more,
several other reliable sources especially mention the presence of
Hungarians in the land at the said time. During the reign of
Charlemagne's successors, for example, a bishop Hungarus by name, is
mentioned in a charter of 888, and Louis the German, for his part,
refers to a mountain called Marca Vengeriorum, in his charter of 860
and even Charlemagne had several times referred to a Hungarian
stronghold in Transdanubia, Sárvár by name (P 059 pp. 241-242).
And, above all, there is a recently discovered Hungarian chronicle
which survived through a Turkish translation (XVIth century), which
states that the Hungarians of Arpad were greatly pleased to learn,
upon their arrival in that country, that its inhabitants spoke the same
language as they did. Thus it is evident that Hungary was already
populated with Hungarian-speaking people before the coming of
Arpad.
2. Anonymus, our best informer on the IXth century events, records in
his Gesta Hungarorum (c. 1200), that the Arpadians, upon entering
the Carpathian basin, had found a large population there whom he
calls Sclaui, Rameni and Blachi. Scholars have been baffled by these
names he alone mentions, all the more since the proffered
explanations led to chronological and linguistic absurdities. Who were
these peoples? The etymological approach gives us the first important
key to this mystery. The Sclaui name, to begin with, is a Hungarian
compound word which includes the following elements: S-K-Lau-i. At
its ending we notice the adjectival suffix -i, usually meaning 'Follower
of, 'Coming from'. The word Lau, which precedes the suffix, is the
dialectal form of the literary Ló, whose first meaning is 'Horse'. In
ancient times, however, the Sungod was meant by it, who was
imagined as riding upon a horse in the sky.(60) The remaining part of



the word, S-K, when vocalised appears as As Ék, or in softened form:
Az Ég, and means 'The Sky'. Thus the whole compound S-K-Lau-i = Az
Égi Ló-i means literally 'Follower of the Heavenly God', i.e. sunwor
shippers. Consequently, the form Sclaui is not an ethnic denomination,
but a religious one, meaning simply sunworshippers.
The Sclaui dwelt all over the land, but their main settlement areas
were in Transdanubia and in Upper Hungary. Now, these regions were
exactly the same ones where the Székely-Hungarians (,Sikeli, Sikeloi,
Siculi) lived until their partial transfer into Transylvania. Incidentally,
their name includes the very same three consonants, S-K-L, which are
to be found in the name of
S-K-Lau-i. Furthermore, in the present-day Székely local language the
word Ló (horse) is often pronounced as Lau, and means, when used as
a title, not horse, but Lord, as in the nobiliary title Ló-Fö 'Highborn
Man, Marquis'. Finally, the Si-keli were also ardent worshippers of the
Sun and their popular art is full of the symbols of the ancestral
suncult. Their name, in the form used two thousand years earlier, was
also analyzed as signifying 'Follower of the Heavenly Lord'. Upon the
basis of so many similarities, we must concede that Anonymus had, no
doubt, meant that group of Hungarian-speaking people under the word
Sclaui, which was mentioned in earlier sources as Sikeloi, i.e. the
present-day Székely, a group probably originating from the
Mesopotamian cultural sphere.
According to Anonymus' narration, the Rameni were natives of
Transdanubia. Their name contained the following components: Ra
Mén-i, a fine Old Hungarian word, meaning 'Follower of the Divine
Stallion', i.e. again sunworshippers, but this time of Egyptian
persuasion. This term probably meant a Hun faction (Huni or Honi =
'Native'), whose name he renders in Latin as habitatores terrae. — The
third group of Hungarians mentioned by Anonymus in their religious



context were the Blachi who used the carved script to write, remarks
the chronicler. This fact alone strongly suggests that they originated
from the Syrian cultural sphere. Their name confirms it, since its
etymological meaning is the Hungarian Bal-Lak-i 'Originating from
Baal's Dwelling', Baal being the Syrian Divinity of Fire', a local variant
of sunworshippers. They are also called Balasi or Blasi, a synonym
meaning 'He who comes from Baal's House'. There are many
Hungarian place-names compounded with the divine name Baal, such
as Bala, Balaton, Bala-vár, Bálványos, Bélkö, etc. The same name
occurs outside Hungary, in such well known geographic names as the
Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic Sea and region, Belgium, etc. Julius
Caesar mentions in his De bello Gallico that Volok (Volcae) people
were living, together with Rutheni, on the northern foothills of the
Pyrenees (P 030 II p. 36 and Index and map). That all these groups of
peoples were mentioned in their religious connections is revealed by a
remark by Anonymus, a Christian priest, who said that the Sclaui and
Blachi were the most wicked people of the whole world, simply
because they served pagan divinities (viliores homines esse totius
mundi quia essent Blasii et Sclaui, P 120 I p. 66).
The continuous use of Near-Eastern religious names is an obvious
proof that the descendants of the Neolithic and Bronze Age
inhabitants of Hungary still formed the bulk of the population in the
IXth century A.D. Nonetheless, it is impossible to make an
approximate calculation about their numerical strength on the eve of
Arpad's coming. We can only guess their relative importance, on the
basis of a specific archaeological fact: from the late Avar period,
Hungary has 40,000 authentic excavated graves, whereas from the
period of the reunification of the land under Arpad, we only possess
10,000. That would mean that the proportion of long settled
Hungarians to the Arpa-dian newcomers, was 4 to 1. The survival of
Hungarians of diverse religious affiliations in the Danube basin since the



Neolithic and Bronze Ages makes them the most ancient inhabitants of
Europe, who were capable of preserving their original ethnic, linguistic
and cultural identity throughout millenia.
3. To complete our survey of the situation in the Danube basis toward
the end of the IXth century, before the arrival of the last major
Hungarian ethnic wave, we must take a look at the political build-up of
the land. It was a chaotic one, because after the destruction of the
Avar-Hungarian State in 803, the country's organization, in the
absence of a central government, relapsed to tribalism and
regionalism. In north-western or Upper Hungary, there existed a small
post-Avar principality centred around the fortress of Nyitra and well
protected by high mountains. Its existence was continuously
mentioned in historical annals until 875, date of its conversion to
Christianity. Upper Hungary's most famous ruler was Prince Tudun,
whose name is last mentioned in a charter of Pope Eugene II in 826,
wherein he was admonished for building Christian churches (P 109 II
p. 35). Tudun is an
Oriental throne-name (< H.: Tudó-(H)Ona: Tóth-Hon) meaning 'Land
of God Thot' (the Egyptian divinity). At the time of the re-unification
of the country under Arpad, the ruler of that region was Prince Zobor
(<H.: Az Avar) meaning 'The Avar ruler'.
South of Upper Hungary, up to the River Raba, and including the Fertő
Lake, lay a second post-Avar principality. Its administrative centre was
Győr ( =H.: Gyürü 'Ring'). Other minor principalities were around
Lake Balaton. All these western Hungarian post-Avar principalities
were given more freedom of action after the division of the Frank
Empire into three nationally based political entities in 843. They
utilized their liberty by seeking help from their fellow Hungarians,
beyond the Carpathian arc, in Eastern Europe.



The Great Central Plain of Hungary was under the nominal sovereignty
of the Bulgarian Empire and was governed by native princes. At its
southern end, in the Danube-Tisza quadrangle, lived the Alan people
called Yazigues; they were obedient to Prince Salan (<H. Az Alán)
'The Alan'. The separate identity of the Yazigues had already been
erased in the Hun period, but their administrative autonomy subsisted
until 1848. The northern portion of the Central Plain was under the
authority of another local prince, Laborci by name, who ruled from his
fortress-city of Hungvár, 'Hun Fortress', according to Anonymus.
To the east of the Tisza, extending up to the Carpathians three small
principalities flourished. The strongest of them ruled in the region of
Szamos and Körös, with a military base in the mountain fortress of
Bihar. The last ruler of this principality was Mén-Marut, whose throne
name meant 'Sungod's Stallion' (Mén = Stallion; Maruth = the Hindu
name of the Sungod). This monarch lived in Oriental fashion, he even
sported a harem at his court, and ruled over a mixed population called
Chozari (<H.: Kos-Ar-i). The second eastern Hungarian ruler, Dux
Gelu or Gyula, governed the Upper Maros area in Ul-transylvania,
'Beyond the forested Land', his throne-seat being at Gyalu. He was
probably a priest-king, whose symbol, a torch, was carried before him
when he travelled officially (P 120 I p. 95). Another high official of
this petty kingdom identified himself by wearing a sun-disk. The last
Gyula maintained his quasi-sovereign status until the reign of King St.
Stephen (1000-1038), who had him captured and imprisoned for life,
"because he was an inveterate pagan, refusing to become a Christian
and was, in many ways, an annoyance to St. Stephen", writes
Anonymus. — The third and last east -Hungarian petty kingdom
included the area bounded by the rivers Maros, Tisza and the Lower
Danube, with a royal residence at Orsova (= Ur Szava) 'Voice of the
Ruler', like the post-Hittite state in the Ancient Orient, Ar-zawa. The
Prince's name in Latin script was Glad or Clad; it is the softened form



of the original Hungarian word Keleti, i.e. 'Oriental'.
As has been proven in the foregone analysis, all the princes and their
petty kingdoms mentioned in the historical sources of the IXth century
definitely bore Hungarian names and ruled over a Hungarian
speaking population. Prof. János Me-lich, a very conscientious linguist,
came to the same conclusion in his last important scientific paper (P
097). He re-examined the pre-Arpadian prince-list and found that
Menmarut and Glad were certainly native Magyars and that all the
other local rulers spoke "faultless Magyar". He also stated that the
great majority of Hungary's population spoke Hungarian on the eve of
Arpad's coming and was racially inter-related.
3. The formation of the Arpadian people in Eastern Europe
Recent historical studies emphasize that the human mass led by Arpad
into the Carpatho-Dan-ubian basin, significantly differed from those
Hungarians already living in that country. The Arpa-dians evolved,
indeed, their ethnic constitution during the sixth to the ninth centuries
only, by merging with westward-moving Hungarian and Turkish
peoples, on the Eastern European Plain. This all began with the
sudden entry of the Turks into the Caspian-Oxus-Aral area in 568 A.D.
That first blow was followed by a second and more violent one in 597
598. As a result, all the tribes living in the southwestern corner of the
great Eurasian steppe began to roll westwards.
The Turks were mostly stock-breeding, mounted nomads of inner
Asiatic origin, having various independent branches, like the Bisseni,
Chasari and Cumani, to mention only those with whom the Magyars
were to come into closer contact. They had their own language, which
has borrowed heavily from the Hungarian vocabulary, and which,
most likely, also included their historical names. In fact, their names
seem to have been given by Hungarians, since they all have a definite



meaning in that language. The word Turki (anc. form: Tourki), seems
to have resulted from the merging of four elements into a single word:
Tó-Ur-Kö-i, meaning literally 'Those who dwell (-i), in the Land (Kö),
of the Ruler (Ur) of the Lake (Tó)', in short 'Lake Dwellers.' The
implied lake was no doubt, the Aral Sea, because it is surrounded by a
lowland called Touran (< H.: Tó-Ur-Hon), 'Home of the Lake Lord'.
The name Bisseni, Pissoni or Pice-Nati (< H.: Pis-Hon-i; today: Viz
Honi) means 'He who lives by the Water'; and Pice-Nati, in inverted
word order (< H.: Nagy-Viz-i) 'He who lives by the Large Water',
probably referring to the Caspian Sea, for originally they had actually
lived on its shores. As regards the Chasars (Khazari, Chosari) their
name is a compound with Kos +Ar + i, i.e. descendants from the
merging of (white) Aryans and (darkish) Kush peoples, as rightly
observed by the Arab writer, Abu-i-Feda, who said: "The Khazars... are
of two types: some are dark-skinned, often almost black; these are
considered as being of Hindu descent. The second race is white
skinned and exceedingly beautiful" (quoted in P 081 p. 56). In the
beginning, the Khazars dwelt on the northern shore of the Caspian
Sea, whose original 'Hyrcania' (= Aryan) name was changed into
Caspis (< H.: Kush-Viz) 'Water of the Kush'. Ail this points to the
important fact that the Turki peoples were a combination of the
subjugated Aryan and Kush population, with a significant admixture of
Mongol elements.
The first Turkish ethnic branch with which the Arpadians came into
close political union were the Khazars, as was recently demonstrated
by Arthur Koestler (P 079) and Vilmos Kovács (P 081). The Khazars
spoke the Tchuvash dialect of Turkish and had laid the foundation of
their empire in the second half of the Vlth century, more exactly in
567. They became the mightiest power in Eastern Europe in the VHth,
Vlllth and IXth centuries. They had extended their domain over the
entire area to the north of the Caucasian ranges, and subjected the



westermost seven Magyar tribes, living between the Kuban and Don
rivers, to their rule, as well as those who dwelt between the Kuma and
Terek rivers, on the western coast of the Caspian. All these Magyar
tribes living in Caucasia, originated from northern Mesopotamia, the
Kingdom of Urartu, and from the post-Hittite states of Syria, especially
from the Kingdoms of Arpad, Karkemish and Damasek (Damask).
They had to leave their old fatherlands, following the bloody
expansion of the Semitic Assyrian Empire, in the second and first
milleniums B.C. In our historical sources, the memory of the
Hungarians at the Don has been preserved under the name of Dentu
Magaria and of those of the Kuma valley as Kum-Magaria.
The Hungarians of Dentu-Magaria have been incorporated into the
Khazar Empire in 568 A.D. and their symbiosis lasted for over three
hundred years. They were entrusted with the all-important task of
safeguarding the western flank of the Khazar Empire and to block the
descent of the Slavonic peoples toward the south. To fulfill their duties
more efficaciously, the seven Magyar tribes in question were
transferred later to a more suitable location, between the Don and
Dnieper, above the Black Sea. The same strategic considerations led
the Khazars to place the Magyar tribes under a single command, for
which Arpad was selected. His installation as 'Deputy king' was carried
out according to Khazar customs, by elevating him on shields. And the
leaders of the seven tribes, for their part, swore allegiance to Arpad,
solemnly declaring that they would faithfully carry out his orders. All
that may have happened around 850, which may be considered the
birth-date of the East-European Hungarian nation, the Danubian one
having already been in existence for a long time.
The Khazar-Hungarian alliance worked well for about two hundred
years, but when the Khazar king adopted the Judaic faith around 740
and forced it upon his court and military men, the first internal



tensions were quick to appear. A civil war erupted in which the rebels
were defeated. As a result, three deeply involved Khazar tribes, called
Kabars, went over to Hungarian side and were absorbed into their
socio-political system. Then came the renewed attack of the fearful
Bisseni-Turks, who had torn away the pasture-land from the Magyars
and forced them to move more westwards (889), into the Dnieper
Seret-Lower-Dan-ube area, thereby severing their secular alliance with
the Khazars completely. At that time, they had already acquired
enough political maturity to make their own decisions as to the best
way to ensure their survival in social surroundings that were growing
more and more precarious.
Their own worry, which was also shared by the Danubian Hungarians,
gave rise in c. 890 to the idea of merging the two Hungarian nations
into one, inside the spacious Carpathian arena which could be
defended more easily than any tribal community on the unbroken,
vast plain beyond the Carpathians. In the meantime, they had to fight
a mysterious battle against the Cuman-Turks near Kiev, of which we
have no details. It is definitely known, however, that the Cumans'
seven tribes were defeated and that they swore an oath of allegiance
to Arpad and then they too were absorbed into the constantly swelling
Magyar conglomerate, which already consisted of seventeen tribes.
Finally, the descendants of Prince Csaba, the youngest son of King
Attila, also joined the Arpadians, together with their innumerable
clans and cognates of the same region. After all these happenings, the
people Arpad led into Hungary were considerably different from the
Danubian Hungarians. Racially, they were of Aryan, Kush and
Mongolian factions. By religion, they were sunworshippers,
fireadorers, Ismaelits and Moslems. Ethnically, they had strong Turkish
traits, bearing such names as Magyar, Khazar, Kabar, Kuman, Hun,
Bisseni, etc. —a real mosaic with a Turkish veneer. In the Byzantine
court they were classified simply as Turki, and not Hungarians. How



did it happen then, that they could, nevertheless, build a Hungary
with all its components and not a 'Turkey'?
4. The re-unification of the country and the birth of Hungary-II as
a modern state
1. After the destruction of the Avar-Hungarian Kingdom by the Franks
in 783-803, the whole Carpathian land relapsed into a state of
political anarchy and became a battlefield for half a dozen dukedoms
and neighbouring great powers. No wonder that the Hungarians
already in the land, had sent emissaries to their brethren on the other
side of the Carpathians, urging them to move in to rebuild, together
with their united forces, the realm of their great ancestor, King Attila.
The Arpadians received similar suggestions from the interested great
powers, namely from King Arnulf (887-899) of Germany, and the
Byzantine emperor Leo the Wise (886-912) to help achieve their own
political objectives. By this means, the Arpadians had several
opportunities of exploring their future land, especially in 862, 881 and
892. All our evidence points to the fact that the vital decision was
already taken in 892.
The preparations for the conquest were in full swing at that time. In
Kiev, where Almus, the father of Arpad was the deputy-king, all the
available blacksmiths were summoned to make hundreds of thousands
of horseshoes, arrows, cartwheels, swords and the like, which were all
kept in storage. Three hundred lumber jacks were also engaged to
clear a passage through the thick forest. A pincer movement was
planned, according to which the bulk of the invaders would penetrate
into Hungary under the leadership of Arpad through the Verecke-pass,
which had never been used before (841 m above s.-l.), and the second
army, under the command of Arpad's father Almus or his elder son
Levente, was supposed to check the Bulgarian forces and penetrate
into Transylvania through its passes and gorges. The invasion started



in the spring of 895 and, except for the unexpected attack of the
Bisseni and Bulgarians, the Hungarian armies met inside the
Carpathian arc during the summer of the same year, as planned. By
900, the entire territory was in their hands, including Transdanubia.
The incoming Arpadians were greeted as liberators and most of the
native populations surrendered spontaneously to the new master of
the land and even helped with the unification. Those few princes and
dukes who failed to change their allegiance in time, paid dearly for
their mistake. Laborci, Gelu and Zubur who resisted, were killed in
action. Two others, Salan and Glad, fled with their followers. The case
of the sixth prince, Men-marut, was a particular one, insofar as he had
wanted to resist at first, but, at the sight of Arpad's armed men, had
asked for a compromise, offering his daughter in marriage to Arpad's
youngest son Zsolt, while he himself swore obedience to Arpad. In
exchange, he was permitted to keep his stronghold of Bihar as a fief
for life. History knows of very few conquests as clean as Arpad's, which
was accomplished practically without bloodshed.
As soon as the territorial unification of the land was achieved, Arpad
summoned the leaders to his fortress of Csongrád and hammered out
the principles ('Constitution'), according to which the reunified
country was to be governed. The next step consisted of setting up
nation-wide institutions, to bind all the inhabitants of Hungary
together into indissoluble unity. These institutions were almost
exclusively, the creation of the native, and not of the half-way
Turkized Hungarians. In other words, the newcomers were culturally
absorbed into the Magyar-speaking local population which formed the
overwhelming majority in the land. This process is well illustrated by
the following remarks. The unified country became a "kingdom" (and
not a khanat according to the Turkish pattern), with a "king" as its
ruler (and not a khan or kende). The highest officials were the Maior
Domus Nádor and the Chief Justice, Ország-biró (and not Horka and



Kádár). The king was represented as someone seated upon a throne
(and not in a saddle on horseback). The symbolic animal identifying
the king was a lion (and not a hyena, ram or dog). One of the most
important institutions, which welded and kept the various elements of
the society together, resulted from the adoption of Christianity. The
new faith imposed, indeed, a common and uniform ideology, and
replaced the pagan Sun-, Fire-, and Baal-cults, which had earlier kept
the nation divided into several parts. Thus, the merging of all
Hungarians of diverse origins, creeds and political traditions into a single
nation was achieved within a relatively short lapse of time.

2. Prince Arpad (+ 907) was not only a military genius but a
successful organizer as well. He clearly perceived the geographic unity



and the strategic position of the Carpathian arena, welded between
two powerful empires. Accordingly, he did not divide the country
amongst the seven princes who were his deputies. On the contrary, he
considered the mountainous periphery of the united land as its
natural defense line and the whole country as an important element of
the European equilibrium, as set forth by the treaty of Verdun in 843.
He was, therefore, anxious to put an end to the encroachments of the
little Moravian State and incorporated its borderland into Hungary in
902.
More fighting was needed before Arpad's strategic-political conception
was recognized and accepted by the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary's
dynamic western neighbour. This empire was naturally inclined to
expand eastward along the Danube valley. The most opportune time
for the realization of its ambitions seemed to arrive with the death of
Arpad, when huge armies were dispatched on both sides of the
Danube toward Hungary. They were, however, defeated right at the
border, in the marshy region of Pozsony (Pres-burg). As a result of this
decisive Hungarian victory, the Danubian provinces of present-day
Austria were annexed by Hungary as far as the river Enns. The whole
area remained under Hungarian rule until 933, when one of their
armies was defeated near Merseburg, and again in 955, near
Augsburg. After these events, Hungary's western borders were
gradually withdrawn to the line of the Lajta and Fischa rivers, where
they were stabilized for a thousand years and mutually recognized.
After that, there was no obstacle for the participation of Hungary
under Prince Géza at the meeting of Quedlinburg (973), called in by
the German emperor Otto the Great, to discuss the common security
problems of Central Europe.(61) The memory of Hungarian rule in
Moravia has been kept alive until our days by numerous village
names, built upon the Hungarian vocable, such as Uhersky and Uhr
Sitz (7 such names), or with other Hungarian words, such as Sallash



(= Szállás), the Hungarian for 'summer dwelling'. Similarly, many
Hungarian village-names survived in the Ostmark, out of which 25
include the word 'Hungarian', such as Ungar-Bach, Ungar-Stein, Ungar
Berg, Marca Hungarica; 103 others are compounded wirh Warte-,
Schiitze and 196 are built upon Ode, meaning uninhabited land, all of
them being situated within the former defense line, as explained by
Sándor Török (P 129 p. 22f).
The relations between Hungary and the Holy See of Rome were always
cordial, as soon as the Hungarians had put their heads under the
baptismal water, thereby irrevocably becoming loyal members of the
new European community. Pope Sylvestre II together with the German
emperor Otto III, recognized Hungary as a sovereign State. As a token,
he sent a golden royal crown to the ruler, who was solemnly
proclamed 'King of Hungary" on Christmas Day of the year 1001. The
Pope's gesture was repeated later by the emperor of Byzantium, who
also recognized the sovereign status of Hungary. The two crowns were
welded together into one and symbolized the great powers' alliance
with Hungary.
The Holy See of Rome also entrusted the kings of Hungary with the
mission to defend, spread and propagate Christianity in the
neighbouring pagan countries, especially in the Balkan Peninsula,
which was full of schismatics at that time. This resulted in Hungary's
expansion toward the Adriatic Sea by including Croatia (1097),
Dalmatia (1105) and Bosnia (1210). Thus, at the end of the XIth
century and the beginning of the XIIth, not only was Hungary's sovereign
status universally recognized, but the country had become a powerful
kingdom, ranking third in importance, right after the Holy Roman and
the Byzantine Empires. So, after a successful start, Christian Hungary
was heading toward the finest hour of its history.
Thus, the period of Ancient History of the Hungarians came to a close.



5. Epilogue: The fate of the lost Hungarian tribes
After the bulk of Hungarian-speaking peoples -Scythians, Huns, Avars
and Magyars- moved out of Eastern Europe and settled in Hungary,
this race ceased to play a significant political role in the oriental part
of the continent. Ethnographi-cally, however, it continued to be
present, since numerous large factions, which were separated from
the main body, stayed behind. The reason for such detachments were
varied. First it was the general custom that migrating steppe peoples
must leave an adequate number of warriors and woman folk behind to
stand guard over the ancient land, upon which they could fall back,
should the search for new and better grazing land fail. Then, internal
political tensions may also have caused secessions. Furthermore, and
most frequently, they were exposed to enemy attacks which could cut
off thousands of people and sweep them away from the main block.
Larger Hungarian break-away tribes stayed behind in the following
areas: 1. in Caucasia, 2. in the Volga region, 3. in Touran and 4. in
Moldavia.
1. In Caucasia, the detached Hungarian tribes were those living
between the Kuma and Terek rivers, on the northwestern side of the
Caspian Sea, called Kum-Magaria. Bear witness of their tribulations
eight papal edicts (Bulls) granted between 1245 and 1291. Their texts
have been published by László Bendefy (P 010). Among the other
contemporary documents relating to the problem we can mention an
inscription carved on stone, found in the Crimean Peninsula and
deciphered by the author. Finally, tradition also deserves to be
mentioned, preserved by both the Danubian Hungarians and the
successors of Hungarians in the East. Amongst the most important
historical studies devoted to this question are the works of L. Bendefy
(P Oil) and János Boros (P 018). But in spite of this apparent richness
of documentation on this topic, many questions remain unanswered,
so that our account is still conjectural on several points.



The Caucasian Hungarians were characterized by the fact that they
lacked comprehensive political organization for a long time, having
lived in chaotic conditions, each of their clans and tribes by
themselves, in as many mini-states. With the emergence of the Mongol
threat, however, the feeling prevailed amongst them, that for their
mutual defense and survival, they must unite their forces. Accordingly,
they all placed themselves under the authority of King Yeretany. This
king wanted, above anything else, to give his kingdom a Christian
organization. Therefore, he turned for help to the Holy See, asking for
catholic priests. These antecedents led to the emission of a first papal
edict by John XXII, on behalf of the "most eminent Prince Yeretany."
We read the following passage in the said edict: "Greetings to our son
Yeretany and other Christian Hungarians (in Caucasia)... We have
understood that thou, my son Yeretany, who art a descendant from the
earliest Catholic kings of Hungary, wanted to receive, together with
other Christians of the said region... a Catholic missionary (doctorem
Catholicum desiratis habere>.)." The first "Catholic Doctor" arrived at
Magyar-on-the-Kuma in the person of Bishop Thaddeus (1331-1334).
He was followed by seven others, the last one holding office from
1366 to 1377. It is not known what became thereafter of Yeretany, but
his epitaph, found in the Crimea suggests, that he was himself a priest
and fled westwards, before the Mongol invasion. His inscription
actually reads thus: "Here is kept, by the Armenian monks, the holy
treasure of Yeretany, an Iranian lord and prince of the Don-bank. (This
treasure) consists of two church-cans. Great holiness was the
distinctive mark of this 'living God'." The dreaded onslaught of the
Mongol armies materialized in 1395/96, when the city of Magyar was
destroyed and the Kuma-Terek plain incorporated into the Kiptchak
Turk empire as a province. The few surviving Magyars then retreated
into the mountains and F. Nansen, the Norvégián explorer, was the last
European who spoke to their descendants in 1925.



2. The second and by far the largest Hungarian-speaking ethnic group,
that of the Volga Hungarians was detached from the main body
somewhere to the north of the Caspian sea in the Vlth century
following the attacks of the Turks, and was pushed northwards along
the river Volga. They were met be the imperial ambassador
Zemarchus, who talked with the "Prince of the Hungarians, who
reigned by the grace of Dizabuli khan" (On-gororum dux qui illic ex
auctoritate Dizabuli impérium habebat" (P 092 p. 93 f.). They were
then lost from sight and had no contact with any other Hungarian
group for about 600 years. They were rediscovered quasi accidentally
in 1236 by zealous Dominicans (Black Friars), who originally wanted
to find the Caucasian Hungarians, for they wanted to convert them to
the Christian faith. Four missionaries started on this venture in 1235,
via Constantinople. However, when they arrived at the city of Matrica
(the present Taman), at the entrance of the Maeotis (now Sea of
Azov), they altered their itinerary for an unknown reason and instead
of continuing eastwards, they turned directly to the north, journeying
along the west bank of the Volga. Finally, Friar Julian, the only
surviving priest, succeeded in finding a large Hungarian tribal group
"near the Great River Ethyl."
There is a report on this unique journey, written in the XHIth century
and submitted to the Holy See of Rome, where it is kept in the Record
Office. Its text is published in the collection of medieval writings
edited by Imre Szentpétery and is currently known as the "Richardus
report" (P 120 II pp. 535-542). This report describes the dramatic
encounter thus: "He (Friar Julian) found them near the great river
Ethyl ( = Volga). When they learned that he was a Christian
Hungarian, they were greatly pleased about his coming. He was
shown their houses and cottages and was pressed with questions
about the king and the realm of Christian Hungarians. To everything
he told them, about faith and other things, they listened attentively,



because their language was entirely Hungarian and they understood
him and he them (quia omnino habent Hungaricum idioma et intellige
bant eum et ipse eos'•)." Julianus then promptly returned to Hungary
to impart his important discovery to his brethren at home. In the next
year (1237), Julianus undertook a second journey to the Volga, but
was unable to reach the Ungarian settlement because the Mongolian
armies were already on the way to make new conquests. In that very
year, Hungary at the Volga had been destroyed, and the nation's ethnic
identity abolished for ever. The surviving individual Magyars were
scattered all around within a radius of about 200km, on the Volga
Heights, around the Pensa and Sura rivers, with some settlements at
Saratov, Tambov and Riazan. Today, their memory is kept alive by a
great number of place-names which include the Magyar name. The
local inhabitants remember that they have Hungarian blood in their
veins, but do not speak Hungarian any more; Turkish and/or Russian
being their language (P 019 p. 229 f.).
3. The Touranian Hungarians always lived somewhat apart from the
other Near Eastern Hungarians, to the east of the Caspian Sea, around
the Aral Sea and in the Oxus valley. In Hungarian chronicles, this is
the region which probably appears under the name of Magoria. This
ethnic group first attracted the attention of our historians in the last
century, when Kristóf Lukácsy devoted a fine work (P 092) to them in
1870. More recently, after World War II, the same area came once
again into the forefront of research, thanks to the insistence of Erik
Molnár, whose example was followed by Tibor Tóth, P.-T. Veres and Pál
Lipták, who all underscored the close connections of the Ura-lian
Hungarians with the Touranians. But it is Antal Bartha who deserves
the credit for having discovered the earliest role of the Touranians,
who were responsible for the civilization of the local population of the
Ural region and that of Western Siberia, in the Und millenium B. C.
The surviving traces of the lost Touranian Hungarians were also



carefully recorded (Kath. Magyarok Vasárnapja, January 12,1969;
Kanadai Magyarság, November 23,1968; Sorsunk, Sidney, February
13, 1960, etc.) and the villages, with 'Madiar' names, noted.
A major faction of Touranian Hungarians seem to have been swept far
away, towards southeastern Asia, into what is today New-Zealand,
where they continue to call themselves Maori (<Ma-Ur-i), i.e. Magyar.
Their existence has been discovered by F. A. Uxbond (alias Wilhelm
von Hevesy) in his sensational book, published in English in 1928 (P
130). This publication lists innumerable evidence to prove that the
Maori are closely related to the European Hungarians, both racially
and culturally. The Maori of to-day are highly civilized, but almost
entirely absorbed into their English-speaking surroundings. The
mystery of the origin of this ethnic faction has not yet been fully
elucidated, which is perhaps connected with the expansion of the
Kushan Empire.
4. Our record would not be complete without mentioning the break
away Hungarian group of Tchangos, now living in Moldavia, on the
other side of the Carpathians, near the rivers Tatros and Sereth,
numbering altogether 170,000 souls. The capital city of Moldavia is
Yassy, the Hungarian Jász-Város 'City of the Yazigues'. Their full story
is related in a recently published 1520-pages monumental
sociographic study, by Pál-Péter Domokos (P 043). The colony started
at the beginning of the Christian era, with a faction of Yazigues that
did not continue its journey into Hungary for reasons unknown to us,
but stayed behind, breaking all relations with their brethren who had
entered Hungary and settled there. The Yazigue colony of Moldavia
later received additional Hungarians, when the warlike Cuman-Turks
set up a principality in Moldavia, then Cumania. To protect Hungary
against the harassments of this pagan people, King András II (1205
1235) placed border-guards on both sides of the Carpathians, at
several points. As a further step toward their pacification, the



archbishop of Esztergom/Hungary, established missionaries in
Cumania, who converted the people to Christianity. The first bishop
had been installed at Milkó in 1227 and was followed by a new influx
of Magyars. Until 1410, five Hungarian bishoprics were erected. An
official census, carried out in the middle of the XVth century, found a
total population of 47,167 in Moldavia. Out of that number, over
20,000 were Catholic Hungarians. On the eve of World War II, the
Tchango-Magyars boasted 60 villages in the Tatros valley and 160
along the Sereth river.
When the northern corner of Moldavia, the district called Bukovina,
was annexed by the Aus-tro-Hungarian Monarchy, general András
Hadik transferred some Moldavian Hungarians into that district. Their
descendants, numbering 24,000 souls, were rapatriated into mother
land Hungary, during the second World War. All the other Tchango
Magyars continue to stay in the land, and are deprived of all cultural
facilities in their own language, not even having elementary
instruction, despite the fact that they are the native people of the land,
who settled there well before the arrival of the first Rumanians in the
XHIth century.
To sum up the sad history of the lost Hungarian tribes, we may say
that ethnographic factions, large or small, which broke away in Eastern
Europe from the main body of Hungarians, were able to retain their
identity for several centuries but most of them disappeared in the great
politico-military upheaval which was brought about by the Mongol
invasion in the XIIIth century.

peuples divers que l'on a appelés les Aryens, et qui ont laissé le
souvenir de grandes civilisations, il y a beaucoup de brachycéphales,
d'Aryen brachycéphales" (P 103 p. 29).
6. It is important to keep in mind that, when our historical sources
mention the "dark" complexion of Kush, they do not always use this
word in a literal sense as 'black', but rather as opposed to white.
Further, the Kush must not be confused with Negroes, who are either
a distinct race, or a product of the jungle. Schuré insists upon this and
says: «Il faut en chercher le type supérieur non pas dans le Nègre



dégénéré, mais dans l'Abyssinien et le Nubien, en qui se conserve le
moule de cette race parvenue à son apogée» (P 114 p. 42).
7. In the first millenium A.D., almost every Eastern-Euro-pean nation
had some brownish-darkish complexioned ethnie elements in their
physical make-up. There were white and dark Huns, white and dark
Bulgars, white and dark Ugors, white and dark Chasars. It is
surprising that this all-important historical fact escaped the attention
of scientists, who persisted in believing that the adjectives White and
Dark, when employed in historical sources, in connection with ethnic
names, would signify the basic points: East and West, i.e. the
geographic position of the respective peoples. This is, of course, a
misinterpretation.
8. Chronicler Simon de Kéza accurately reflects the general feeling of
Hungarians against the dark coloured population by saying: "Gentes
siquidem in eadem (i.e. in Scythia) procreate otia complectuntur,
vanitatibus de-dite, nature dedignantis actibus venereis intendentes,
rapiñas amant, generaliter colore plus nigre quam albe" (P 120 I p.
252).
9. Former linguists and historians were inclined to consider the Kush
population as of Old Turkish extraction. It was, however, impossible to
find a fitting Turkish branch, or to determine the specific geographic
area where contacts between Hungarians and Turks might have taken
place. Above all, the beginning of the Kush-Hungarian relations
antedates the existence of any Turkish people. Therefore, the idea of
early Turkish-Hungarian connections had to be abandoned (see Prof.
Benko in P 009 p. 50).
10. The same opinion was expressed in a most recent German
language publication by Ferenc Kemény: "(Dass) das Ungarische
einerseits allen eurasischen Sprachen als Grundlage gedient hat,



andererseits eine echte Ursprache ist, deren Ursprung aus dem
heutigen Bestand derselben eindeutig erklaert werden kann (P 078 p.
115; see ibiden pp. 50, 61).
11. That Hungarian is an Aryan tongue par excellence, was stated
time and again by a number of linguists; most emphatically be Kristóf
Lukácsy, who said this: "When I say that Hungarian belongs to the
Aryan class of languages, I am summarizing the results of my
investigations of several years, conducted in the field of Hungarian
linguistics and antiquities" (P 092 p. 199).
12. "Aryan is the terminus technicus describing one of the great
language-groups extending from India to Europe" (P 038; see also
P133 and P 132). - Formerly, by mistake, the European languages
were collectively classified as Aryan. But their names do not include
the distinctive vocable Ari. Their kinship is based only upon the word
stock present in their substratum. — For the Aryan term, see also P
091 pp. 27-30; and Encycl. Britannica, ed. 1947, t. II p. 494.
13. "Ihm (Illitch-Switytch) war es gelungen, das System der
Lautentsprechungen zwischen den indoeuropäischen, den uralischen,
den altaischen... der khartweli-schen, den hamito-semitischen und
den dravidischen Sprachen zu erkennen. Diese Lautentsprechungen
beziehen sich auf Hunderte von Wortwurzeln einer eura-sischen
Ursprache deren man die Bezeichnung 'nostra-tisch' oder 'boreisch'
gab, — writes Dolgopolski in his German language account (P 042).
— See also the Hungarian complement to this study by Gy. Hary in
Valóság (Budapest, October 1976, p. 177). - Dolgopolski continues
thus: "Als Urheimat der boreischen Sprache, kommt nach allem, was
wir heute wissen, der Raum von Indien, und von Kaukasien bis zum
Persischen Golf, in Frage." - "Die boreische Sprachgemeinschaft muss
demnach in der mittleren Steinzeit, vor Beginn der Jungsteinzeit,
bestanden haben..." (P 042).



14. «Le nom du peuple Aryen reste jusqu'à présent sans explication
certaine» (P 091 p. 75).
15. Bird-headed statuettes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia
already from the time of the Flood (P 006 I p. 56). In Hungary too,
bird-headed bone-sticks have been found on several sites (P 050 p.
258).
16. Most of the Oriental place - and ethnic names with a Hungarian
meaning have been collected from the following five publications: P
013; P 021; P 024; P 044; and P 085. Some others were found in the
works of Herodotus, Dauzat, Uxbond, Saks, etc.
17. Toppeltinus: "...etiamnum vocantur Magori. Ingens populus et ipsi
armorum gloria inclytum regnum possi-dent" (P 092 pp. 98, 203).
18. L.A. Waddell comments Barat-Varsha thus: "The Land of the Barats
(Barat Varsha) a name synonymous with 'Barat Ana' or 'Land of the
Barats', which I have proved to be the original form of the name 'Brit
Ain' as given to Albion about 1100 B.C. by... the same Aryan race of
Barats... who civilized India and the Ganges valley" (P 132 bis p. 10);
see also the entry under 'Barata Varsha' in P 044).
19. "They called it /Egypt/ the land of Mezor ( = Magyar) and the
land of Cham / = Kush/ from their two ancestors, which the Greek
rendered Mesora and Chamia" (P 023 p. 298). — The same idea is
expressed in the following quotation "Throughout the early dynastic
period and the Old Kingdom /of Egypt/ Set (= the dark ruler ) and
Horus (the Aryan ruler) are represented as the two patron-deities of
the Monarchy" (John Van Saters, The Hyksos, London 1966 p. 98).
20. The transliteration of carved signs into Roman characters is
usually done 1. with capital letters for the graphically expressed
sounds; and 2. with small characters for the sounds supplied by the



decipherer. And 3. in our transliterations a dot is inserted between the
elements of every combined sound-sign. 4. The omitted consonants or
words are given in parentheses (), while 5. the broken-off and missing
signs are in brackets /.../.
21. The word Pogány 'Pagan' originates from the Latin Pagus 'Village'
and Paganus 'Villager', signifying 'People living in the countryside.' In
the Middle Ages, the same word was, however, used in a pejorative
sense to say 'uneducated, backward, despicable', especially when
speaking of non-Christian people. The alternative word for Pagan is
Heathen. It is probably derived from the Old Hungarian word Héth
'Seven', a shortened from of the expression 'Follower of the Seven
Great Gods.'
22. Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of the cruel
treatment King St. Stephen inflicted upon Thonuzoba who "stubbornly
adhering to his beliefs, was unwilling to become a Christian, and was
buried alive with his wife" (P 120 I p. 117). A similar cruel
punishment was imposed upon a woman, Raski by name, who was
prominent in a heathen uprising: "(She) was captured by the very
Christian King Béla and confined in prison until she ate her own feet,
and also died in the same place" (P 120 I p. 398). Persecutions of
adherents to the old faith continued until about the middle of the
XHIth century, the last dreaded inquisitor having been Johannes
Theuthon (+1252), commissioner of the Holy See to several Central
European states (P 047).
23. King Saint Stephen mentions in his gift-charter granted to the
nuns of Veszprém-Valley: "Ibi stat meta lapidea, que volgo Baluan
vocatur," "There stands a boundary-stone, called Idol by the local
population." ― Similarly, King András I ordered in his edict of 1047:
"Falsos deos abrogare et Simulacra demoliri", "to suppress the false
gods and to destroy the idols" (P 082 p. 367).



24. A witness who attended a meeting of wise-men, testified before
the Christian inquisitor by saying: "Wiseman Bansa climbed to the top
of a high ladder, stayed there for a while, chatting with God and, back
on earth, he foretold the future to his audience" (P 047 p. 56).
25. "Each time a Pharaoh was conceived, Ra was said to have returned
to earth to espouse the queen' (P 045 p. 50).
26. The corresponding passage by Anonymus reads thus: "matri eius
pregnanti per sompnium apparuit divina visio in forma Asturis que
quasi veniens earn gravidavit et innotuit ei quod de utero eius
egrederetur torrens et de limbis eius reges gloriosi propagarentur" (P
120 I p. 38).
27. "erat enim ipse Almus facie decorus sed niger, nigros habebat
oculos sed magnos, statura longus et gracilis, manus vero habebat
grossas et digitos prolixos" (P 120 I p. 38).
28. The grandson of Prince Arpad, Taksony, was of white complexion,
while Arpad's great-grandson took after him: "He had beautiful big
eyes and soft dark hair". Certain kings of the dynasty were of very
high stature, as, for example, St. Stephen, King András I, St. Ladislas
and King Béla III.
29. Prof. Gardiner states that the Egyptian Arpad may have been
"perhaps the first to become ruler upon earth over the autochthonous
Egyptians, after whom followed Osiris and the Horus" (P 052 p.
*110).
30. See the following references: P 052 I pp. *14 - *19, "103 and
*108; and P 026 II 94 - 100, 109, 153 and 374. -If the Sumerian name
for Earth was also Pat, Pot, the Sumerian ruler's title Pat-Esi (=H. Föld
Őse) also meant 'Land Ancestor' or 'Land Lord'.



31. Many rulers of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty had throne-names
with a clear Oriental meaning, and this explains why certain names
appear so often, like István (five times) and Béla (four times). In the
Old Hungarian spelling István or Están was the word for Isten 'God'.
Béla (in O.H. Bala, Baal, Bika) was the Syrian name for Great-God.
They were used in an abridged form, all bearing testimony that their
wearers were 'Living Gods', i.e. Gods on Earth, exactly as was the
practice in the Ancient Orient.
32. Babylon was surrounded by seven walls; the Mesopotamian
Ziggurat had seven floors; Mesopotamian noblemen wore seven
ruffled kilts; Egypt had seven great gods; the Egyptian Heaven had
seven divisions; the Hittite Empire (the Biblical Héth) started with the
fusion of seven lands; the Etruscan nation began with the federation
of seven cities; Rome was built on seven hills; etc. etc.
33. According to Prof. Áldásy, the double-cross cannot be considered
an apostolic cross; this latter was always a single cross (P 001 p. 63).
Thus, he indirectly admits the pre-Christian origin of this important
symbol.
34. The best edition of the medieval national chronicles is that of
Emericus Szentpétery, former professor at Budapest University (F 120
I-II).
35. "Et primus rex Scythiae fuit Magog filius Japhet, et gens ilia a
Magog rege vocata est Moger", ― writes Anonymus (P 120 I p. 35).
36. On these conflicting views see, particularly, the Chroni-con Pictum
(P 120 I pp. 243-250, and the Hungarian translation: P 053 pp. 35
37).
37. No Hungarian historian has taken notice until now that Egyptian
literature also know of a hunting hero, Onuris by name (like the



Hungarian Hunor), who had a mate called Mehit, 'lioness'. See the
somewhat confused passage in P 032 p. 227, which reads: "His
(Onuris') cult figure was a man wearing a long skirt, his feet poised
well apart, to enable him to aim a spear downwards at some
monstrous foe. His worship was centred in Thinis, a district which also
included Abydos." The Coffin Texts, III 334 j. are given as reference.
38. The original wording is thus: 'Ubi propter intemperiem illius zonae
sunt serpentes diversi generis, ranae velut porci, basilisci, et plura
animalia toxicata; tigris et unicornis ibi generantur." Where gold,
silver and pearls are also to be found (P 120 I p. 253. See also P 130
p. 164, where another location is suggested).
39. This is the opinion of many international authorities, like C.
Dawson who writes this: "It is certainly in the Danubian region that
we find (in Europe) the most complete and typical example of any
early peasant culture" (P 039 p. 53). And H. T. Waterbolk: "(Toward
3000 B.C.), the Hungarian Plain was a dominant centre which had
incorporated all the major achievements of the nuclear area in the
Near East and which had added to these an adaptation to the
European deciduous forest" (P 134).
40. for the westward diffusion of the Hungarian Neolithic and Bronze
Age civilizations see, in addition to the quoted references in the text,
in particular P 039 pp. 51 and 169.
41. In the light of the etymology given there, we have to abandon the
fantastic explanation of the Greek writers of the past, who believed
that the Italian Siculi were governed by One-Eyed Giants, interpreting
the Syc-Lo-Pe expression as being the Greek word Cyclops.
42. Thukydides relates that "the country owes its name of Italy to
Italus, a king of Sicel, so called." Now, Ital, as a Hungarian word,
means a 'drink', and Italos somebody 'fond of alcoholic drink'. The



explanation seems to be a fitting one, because the early Sicels are said
to have been fond of wine, which they drank in the Scythian fashion,
i.e. unmixed with water (P 067 Book VI cap. 84 and Book I cap. 106).
― Incidentally, the Greek name of Sungod, Apollo, is, in their
language, a Hungarian loan-word, made up with Pe + Ló, and the
prefixed definitive article A, whence A Pe-Lo, contracted into Apollo,
literally means 'The Chief Horse'.
43. Prof. Hood is reluctant to see actual writing upon the tablets: "But
do the Tartaria ( = Tatárlaka) tablets actually bear writing? Probably
not... It seems quite possible that they were merely an
uncomprehending imitation of more civilized peoples' written
records... a pretense by some illiterate barbarian to command the
magic embodied in an art he had witnessed but did not understand"
(P 068).
44. The calendar was a precious instrument in the hands of every
farming community of the Antiquity. It enabled the peasants to know
the most appropriate time to carry out certain important tasks, such as
plowing and sowing in particular and it was also useful for the timing
of religious festivals.
45. In Atlantic Europe, the observation of the various seasonal
positions of the Sun, in reference to the zodiacal star-clusters, was
made with the help of heavy megalith-ic structures (e.g. Stonehenge).
In the Danubian region, the more advanced microlithic structure
prevailed. This is the significant difference between the two halves of
Europe, although this has never been pointed out until now.
46. The step-by-step explanation of the inscription is thus: in the
second compartment we can distinguish the rising Sun, in Hungarian
A Nap. On its right side, the contours of a mouse (H.: Az Egér) are
visible, with its thin, long tail. The picture of this animal is here



because it is homophonous with the expression Az Égre, 'to the sky'.
So, the thus far deciphered words say this: A Nap az Égre 'The Sun to
the sky'. After that, we read the signs placed in the left and right
columns, saying: the cross sign iT, the crab A RÁK, followed by a sign
for the sound-group KUR/KOR, and finally the word for donkey IÁ. In
modern Hungarian: Itt a rákkor jö 'Comes at this spot in the Cancer
constellation'. The directive continues in the third compartment thus:
aN-aP Je-Le aR-áK öV-Be... 'The day's symbol in the Cancer zone is...
The complete message in better English reads: 'Here (at Tatárlaka) the
Sun appears on the horizon in the Cancer constellation on the day of...
― The homophony existing between 'Sky God' (Az Égúr) and the
mouse (Az Egér) was probably the origin of the never-explained
Oriental custom of keeping white mice in Sun-temples, as was the
case in Babylon and Egypt. The presence of these small animals was a
mean amongst a hundred others, to remind the believers that God
may hide himself in any of his creatures to watch over their behaviour.
47. «La science considére aujourd'hui que les Celtes ne constituent pas
une race, dans le sens propre du terme mais ont toujours été un
groupe de peuples, formánt un agrégat de types du point de vue
anthropologique» (P 057 p. 10; and see P 070 I p. X and P 132 p.
128).
48. The thesis of the linguistic unity of Celtic Europe is stressed by
almost every author, as for example P 037 p. 12; P 057 pp. 10-12; P
070 I pp. 49, 51. The hundred million Celts are mentioned in the
publication P 057 p. 11.
49. Henri Hubert consoles himself by saying: «Rien d'étonnant que ces
noms soient difficile á expliquer et que leur sens etymologique se soit
évanoui» (P 070 I p. 27 f.).
50. "Erat enim rex Ethele colore teter, oculis nigris et furiosis, pectore



lato, elatus incessu, statura brevis, barbam prolixam gum Hunnis
deferebat" (P 120 I p. 151).
51. Author Agathias writing about the Hunnorum Gens says this: "Hi
vero omnes communiter Scythae et Hunni vocabantur, privátim
autem, secundum nationes alii aliter ex patria cuique et usita
appellatione nominaban-tur", quoted by P 092 p. 130.
52. "Mensa erat tota aurea, vasa etiam coquinaria aurea erant",
records Simon de Kéza (P 120 I p. 262).
53. Clenodia aurea que a tempore regis Ungariae Attila et ab aliis
successoribus suis usque nunc in Ungaria fuerant conservata" (P 099
p. 187 f.).
54. It should be noted, once again, that the ancient royal Egyptian
symbols also included the bird, the whip and the bee.
55. Incidentally, ancient Egyptian kings had the same custom: "The
warrior kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties were pleased when
the court scribes related in commemorative inscriptions how their
lords raged and roared like lions as they mounted their chariots and
set out to crush the foolish enemy" (P 026 I p. 25 f.)
56. "Sie besassen keine Sprache, sondern stiessen kurze, rauhe Laute
aus, wie Tiere auf der Flucht" (P 113 p. 17).
57. "Sie sind treuer and harter als die Germanen, sie kennen nichts als
den König" (P 113 p. 130).
58. "Der Name Attila ist heute zweifelsfrei als Germanisch 'Váterchen'
erkannt", Die Presse, Stuttgart, 20, May 1975.
59. The Swiss anthropologist E. Pittard was one of the first scientists
to suspect the close affinity of the early inhabitants of Hungary. He



said: «I1 est probable, á voir les caractéres morphologiques des
habitants de la Hongrie, que parmi les peuples qui arrivaient de l'Est,
il y en avait plusieurs qui étaient puisés aux mémes fonds ethniques
que les Magyars eux-mémes» (P 103 p. 341).
60. Several examples can be listed to prove that Horse (Lau) was used
to say Ra, the Sungod. In the Zagros mountains, to the east of
Mesopotamia, there was a small country called Lauristan (<H.: Ló-Ur
Isten), 'Land placed under the protection of the Horse-Lordgod' i.e.
Sungod. It was the unique task of the Scythians who lived in that
country to raise horses for the Persian armies. Their popular art was
also overladen with horse representations. — Another example: The
Armenian bishop, Israyel, who travelled into the land of the Huns and
described their beliefs, said this: "The Huns worshipped their highest
divinity in the form of a giant warrior, mounted on horseback" (P 081
p. 65). - The Hungarian AU sound usually changes into 0, as in the
city-name of Iglau, which is in modern Hungarian, Igló.
61. Originally, the eastern border lands of Germany (the future
Austria) were a creation of Frankish rulers. They were re-established
later, as duchies of Carinthia (976), Carniola (1040), Styria (1055)
and Ostmark (1156).

THE MAGYAR HUNGARIANS
1. Massive influx of Magyars into the Carpathian Land and the
birth of Hungary-I
After the collapse of the Hun rule in Hungary (453), the major
Germanic tribes of the country — Goths, Gepids and Longobards (the
latter since 526 only), — set up individual principalities and quarreled
violently amongst themselves. The Longobards were striving for
predominance but, not having the necessary strength to achieve it,
asked a Hun faction of Eastern Europe to help them defeat their rivals.
With the support of this Magyar tongued faction called Avari (Avars),
the Longobards drove out the Gepids, but felt so insecure in their
domain that they deemed it advisable to evacuate Hungary. They
actually fled to Italy in 568, together with their families. After that, the
Avar Hungarians set up their own kingdom (568-803) in the entire
Carpathian area. At the beginning, the Avar Kingdom extended from
the Don in the East to the Enns in the West. Later it shrank and
covered only the Carpathian basin, the Vienna Plain and the
Bohemian Plateau.
There was much speculation about the ethnic identity of the Avars.
But it seems certain that they already spoke Hungarian when they first
appeared on the scene of history. Their name Avari (< H.: A vár-i)
means, indeed 'Those who live in enclosures (Rings)'. And the throne



name of their first great ruler, under whose leadership they entered
the Carpathian land, was Baján (< H.: Be-Jön), a homophon of 'He
who comes in'. More information is available about the ethnic identity
of the second Avar ethnic wave (670), composed of "White
Hungarians", as is definitely stated in the Russian chronicle of Nestor.
The vastness of Magyar human material that settled thus in Hungary
at that time is reflected by the great number of their graves which
have been excavated, 40,000. The newcomers occupied the edges of
the Great Central Plain, and Transdanubia, and also southern
Hungary, i.e. the best arable lands of the country. The seat of their
government was in Györ (< H.: Gyürü = 'Ring'), a strategically
located and well fortified stronghold at the confluence of the Raba
river and the Danube. The Hungarian chroniclers never use the term
Avar when speaking about them. They call them simply Hungarians,
as do the majority of West-European chronicles as well. They add, at
best, a few adjectives for the sake of a clarification, like "Avars who
are called Hungarians" {Avari qui dicuntur Ungari); "Avars who are
called Huns and Hungarians as well" (Avari qui et Huni sive Hungari).
By the same token, un Avar king is mentioned with the title of "King of
Hungary". The latter has been a famous ruler because his daughter
Berthe became the wife of Pepin and subsequently the mother of
Charlemagne. The quoted data clearly suggest that from 670 onwards,
the Magyars already formed a united nation in the Car-patho
Danubian basin and had an organized State headed by kings. That
was a historical event, and this explains why Prince Arpad could set
up a smoothly working State-apparatus so easily after his entry into
the land. For him, the help of the Hungarians in the Rings was
inevaluable.
The Avar-Hungarian kingdom lasted for about two and a half
centuries. Afterwards, the reorganized Frank Empire resumed past
Germanic expansion toward the East under the half-Hungarian



Charlemagne (771-814) who organized a series of razzias against
Hungary between 796 and 803 and destroyed its central government.
Charlemagne was not much interested in territorial gains. He
preferred to loot the Rings, where the nation's treasures — gold, silver
and precious stones — were guarded. On a single occasion, for
example, he 'collected' so much treasures that 14 wagons were needed
to cart them away from Hungary. Chronicler Eginard (Einhard)
commented on that big haul by saying: "According to human memory,
there was no earlier war in which the Franks have become as wealthy
as just now; for until now, they were poor" (cf. P 098 pp. 113, 240).
As regards the Magyar population of Avar-Hun-gary, it survived the
loss of their State and continued to live almost undisturbed. The
largest administrative unit which continued to function was that
located around Lake Fertő, a rather swampy region in western
Hungary. It was last mentioned in 873. A second surviving mini-state
was the realm of Tudun, in Upper Hungary. This one endured until the
coming of Arpad in 895. The harmful consequence of Frankish
incursions into Hungary was the creation of a politico-military vacuum
in a so vitally strategic part of Central Europe, which caused a lot of
inconveniences both to the local population and to the Germans as
well. Therefore, emissaries were sent to the East-European Arpad
Hungarians even by the German king Arnulf who urged them to come
in to help stabilize the situation. The craving for a new unifier was
fulfilled in 895, with the entry on the scene of Prince Arpad. His coming
opened a new chapter in Central Europe's history.
2. Hungary's ethnographic and political conditions in the IXth
century
1. In the previous chapters we have explained how Magyar-speaking
ethnic groups continuously poured into the Carpathian land, ever
since Neolithic times. They came in successive waves, in increasing



numbers and under various denominations: Magyars, Székely, Kush,
Scythians, Celts, Huns, Avars, etc. Their common starting point was
the Ancient Near-East and they were linked by ethnic, cultural and
linguistic ties. This morphological coherence of the early Hungarians
is probably the most important discovery in our recent historical
science.(59) Now, it will be interesting to find out whether the earliest
population and its descendants were still evident in the IXth century,
at the eve of Arpad's coming.
A first indication of the presence of Magyars is that the mountain-,
river- and village-names they had imparted to the geographic features
of the land were still all in use. Furthermore, their identification
symbols: the bird, the bee, the lion and the ram were also deeply
embedded in the folklore, which was strongly impregnated with
suncult and with general Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Syrian
connections. All that would be impossible to explain without the
continuous presence of the same population and, what is more,
several other reliable sources especially mention the presence of
Hungarians in the land at the said time. During the reign of
Charlemagne's successors, for example, a bishop Hungarus by name, is
mentioned in a charter of 888, and Louis the German, for his part,
refers to a mountain called Marca Vengeriorum, in his charter of 860
and even Charlemagne had several times referred to a Hungarian
stronghold in Transdanubia, Sárvár by name (P 059 pp. 241-242).
And, above all, there is a recently discovered Hungarian chronicle
which survived through a Turkish translation (XVIth century), which
states that the Hungarians of Arpad were greatly pleased to learn,
upon their arrival in that country, that its inhabitants spoke the same
language as they did. Thus it is evident that Hungary was already
populated with Hungarian-speaking people before the coming of
Arpad.
2. Anonymus, our best informer on the IXth century events, records in



his Gesta Hungarorum (c. 1200), that the Arpadians, upon entering
the Carpathian basin, had found a large population there whom he
calls Sclaui, Rameni and Blachi. Scholars have been baffled by these
names he alone mentions, all the more since the proffered
explanations led to chronological and linguistic absurdities. Who were
these peoples? The etymological approach gives us the first important
key to this mystery. The Sclaui name, to begin with, is a Hungarian
compound word which includes the following elements: S-K-Lau-i. At
its ending we notice the adjectival suffix -i, usually meaning 'Follower
of, 'Coming from'. The word Lau, which precedes the suffix, is the
dialectal form of the literary Ló, whose first meaning is 'Horse'. In
ancient times, however, the Sungod was meant by it, who was
imagined as riding upon a horse in the sky.(60) The remaining part of
the word, S-K, when vocalised appears as As Ék, or in softened form:
Az Ég, and means 'The Sky'. Thus the whole compound S-K-Lau-i = Az
Égi Ló-i means literally 'Follower of the Heavenly God', i.e. sunwor
shippers. Consequently, the form Sclaui is not an ethnic denomination,
but a religious one, meaning simply sunworshippers.
The Sclaui dwelt all over the land, but their main settlement areas
were in Transdanubia and in Upper Hungary. Now, these regions were
exactly the same ones where the Székely-Hungarians (,Sikeli, Sikeloi,
Siculi) lived until their partial transfer into Transylvania. Incidentally,
their name includes the very same three consonants, S-K-L, which are
to be found in the name of
S-K-Lau-i. Furthermore, in the present-day Székely local language the
word Ló (horse) is often pronounced as Lau, and means, when used as
a title, not horse, but Lord, as in the nobiliary title Ló-Fö 'Highborn
Man, Marquis'. Finally, the Si-keli were also ardent worshippers of the
Sun and their popular art is full of the symbols of the ancestral
suncult. Their name, in the form used two thousand years earlier, was
also analyzed as signifying 'Follower of the Heavenly Lord'. Upon the



basis of so many similarities, we must concede that Anonymus had, no
doubt, meant that group of Hungarian-speaking people under the word
Sclaui, which was mentioned in earlier sources as Sikeloi, i.e. the
present-day Székely, a group probably originating from the
Mesopotamian cultural sphere.
According to Anonymus' narration, the Rameni were natives of
Transdanubia. Their name contained the following components: Ra
Mén-i, a fine Old Hungarian word, meaning 'Follower of the Divine
Stallion', i.e. again sunworshippers, but this time of Egyptian
persuasion. This term probably meant a Hun faction (Huni or Honi =
'Native'), whose name he renders in Latin as habitatores terrae. — The
third group of Hungarians mentioned by Anonymus in their religious
context were the Blachi who used the carved script to write, remarks
the chronicler. This fact alone strongly suggests that they originated
from the Syrian cultural sphere. Their name confirms it, since its
etymological meaning is the Hungarian Bal-Lak-i 'Originating from
Baal's Dwelling', Baal being the Syrian Divinity of Fire', a local variant
of sunworshippers. They are also called Balasi or Blasi, a synonym
meaning 'He who comes from Baal's House'. There are many
Hungarian place-names compounded with the divine name Baal, such
as Bala, Balaton, Bala-vár, Bálványos, Bélkö, etc. The same name
occurs outside Hungary, in such well known geographic names as the
Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic Sea and region, Belgium, etc. Julius
Caesar mentions in his De bello Gallico that Volok (Volcae) people
were living, together with Rutheni, on the northern foothills of the
Pyrenees (P 030 II p. 36 and Index and map). That all these groups of
peoples were mentioned in their religious connections is revealed by a
remark by Anonymus, a Christian priest, who said that the Sclaui and
Blachi were the most wicked people of the whole world, simply
because they served pagan divinities (viliores homines esse totius
mundi quia essent Blasii et Sclaui, P 120 I p. 66).



The continuous use of Near-Eastern religious names is an obvious
proof that the descendants of the Neolithic and Bronze Age
inhabitants of Hungary still formed the bulk of the population in the
IXth century A.D. Nonetheless, it is impossible to make an
approximate calculation about their numerical strength on the eve of
Arpad's coming. We can only guess their relative importance, on the
basis of a specific archaeological fact: from the late Avar period,
Hungary has 40,000 authentic excavated graves, whereas from the
period of the reunification of the land under Arpad, we only possess
10,000. That would mean that the proportion of long settled
Hungarians to the Arpa-dian newcomers, was 4 to 1. The survival of
Hungarians of diverse religious affiliations in the Danube basin since the
Neolithic and Bronze Ages makes them the most ancient inhabitants of
Europe, who were capable of preserving their original ethnic, linguistic
and cultural identity throughout millenia.
3. To complete our survey of the situation in the Danube basis toward
the end of the IXth century, before the arrival of the last major
Hungarian ethnic wave, we must take a look at the political build-up of
the land. It was a chaotic one, because after the destruction of the
Avar-Hungarian State in 803, the country's organization, in the
absence of a central government, relapsed to tribalism and
regionalism. In north-western or Upper Hungary, there existed a small
post-Avar principality centred around the fortress of Nyitra and well
protected by high mountains. Its existence was continuously
mentioned in historical annals until 875, date of its conversion to
Christianity. Upper Hungary's most famous ruler was Prince Tudun,
whose name is last mentioned in a charter of Pope Eugene II in 826,
wherein he was admonished for building Christian churches (P 109 II
p. 35). Tudun is an
Oriental throne-name (< H.: Tudó-(H)Ona: Tóth-Hon) meaning 'Land
of God Thot' (the Egyptian divinity). At the time of the re-unification



of the country under Arpad, the ruler of that region was Prince Zobor
(<H.: Az Avar) meaning 'The Avar ruler'.
South of Upper Hungary, up to the River Raba, and including the Fertő
Lake, lay a second post-Avar principality. Its administrative centre was
Győr ( =H.: Gyürü 'Ring'). Other minor principalities were around
Lake Balaton. All these western Hungarian post-Avar principalities
were given more freedom of action after the division of the Frank
Empire into three nationally based political entities in 843. They
utilized their liberty by seeking help from their fellow Hungarians,
beyond the Carpathian arc, in Eastern Europe.
The Great Central Plain of Hungary was under the nominal sovereignty
of the Bulgarian Empire and was governed by native princes. At its
southern end, in the Danube-Tisza quadrangle, lived the Alan people
called Yazigues; they were obedient to Prince Salan (<H. Az Alán)
'The Alan'. The separate identity of the Yazigues had already been
erased in the Hun period, but their administrative autonomy subsisted
until 1848. The northern portion of the Central Plain was under the
authority of another local prince, Laborci by name, who ruled from his
fortress-city of Hungvár, 'Hun Fortress', according to Anonymus.
To the east of the Tisza, extending up to the Carpathians three small
principalities flourished. The strongest of them ruled in the region of
Szamos and Körös, with a military base in the mountain fortress of
Bihar. The last ruler of this principality was Mén-Marut, whose throne
name meant 'Sungod's Stallion' (Mén = Stallion; Maruth = the Hindu
name of the Sungod). This monarch lived in Oriental fashion, he even
sported a harem at his court, and ruled over a mixed population called
Chozari (<H.: Kos-Ar-i). The second eastern Hungarian ruler, Dux
Gelu or Gyula, governed the Upper Maros area in Ul-transylvania,
'Beyond the forested Land', his throne-seat being at Gyalu. He was
probably a priest-king, whose symbol, a torch, was carried before him



when he travelled officially (P 120 I p. 95). Another high official of
this petty kingdom identified himself by wearing a sun-disk. The last
Gyula maintained his quasi-sovereign status until the reign of King St.
Stephen (1000-1038), who had him captured and imprisoned for life,
"because he was an inveterate pagan, refusing to become a Christian
and was, in many ways, an annoyance to St. Stephen", writes
Anonymus. — The third and last east -Hungarian petty kingdom
included the area bounded by the rivers Maros, Tisza and the Lower
Danube, with a royal residence at Orsova (= Ur Szava) 'Voice of the
Ruler', like the post-Hittite state in the Ancient Orient, Ar-zawa. The
Prince's name in Latin script was Glad or Clad; it is the softened form
of the original Hungarian word Keleti, i.e. 'Oriental'.
As has been proven in the foregone analysis, all the princes and their
petty kingdoms mentioned in the historical sources of the IXth century
definitely bore Hungarian names and ruled over a Hungarian
speaking population. Prof. János Me-lich, a very conscientious linguist,
came to the same conclusion in his last important scientific paper (P
097). He re-examined the pre-Arpadian prince-list and found that
Menmarut and Glad were certainly native Magyars and that all the
other local rulers spoke "faultless Magyar". He also stated that the
great majority of Hungary's population spoke Hungarian on the eve of
Arpad's coming and was racially inter-related.
3. The formation of the Arpadian people in Eastern Europe
Recent historical studies emphasize that the human mass led by Arpad
into the Carpatho-Dan-ubian basin, significantly differed from those
Hungarians already living in that country. The Arpa-dians evolved,
indeed, their ethnic constitution during the sixth to the ninth centuries
only, by merging with westward-moving Hungarian and Turkish
peoples, on the Eastern European Plain. This all began with the
sudden entry of the Turks into the Caspian-Oxus-Aral area in 568 A.D.



That first blow was followed by a second and more violent one in 597
598. As a result, all the tribes living in the southwestern corner of the
great Eurasian steppe began to roll westwards.
The Turks were mostly stock-breeding, mounted nomads of inner
Asiatic origin, having various independent branches, like the Bisseni,
Chasari and Cumani, to mention only those with whom the Magyars
were to come into closer contact. They had their own language, which
has borrowed heavily from the Hungarian vocabulary, and which,
most likely, also included their historical names. In fact, their names
seem to have been given by Hungarians, since they all have a definite
meaning in that language. The word Turki (anc. form: Tourki), seems
to have resulted from the merging of four elements into a single word:
Tó-Ur-Kö-i, meaning literally 'Those who dwell (-i), in the Land (Kö),
of the Ruler (Ur) of the Lake (Tó)', in short 'Lake Dwellers.' The
implied lake was no doubt, the Aral Sea, because it is surrounded by a
lowland called Touran (< H.: Tó-Ur-Hon), 'Home of the Lake Lord'.
The name Bisseni, Pissoni or Pice-Nati (< H.: Pis-Hon-i; today: Viz
Honi) means 'He who lives by the Water'; and Pice-Nati, in inverted
word order (< H.: Nagy-Viz-i) 'He who lives by the Large Water',
probably referring to the Caspian Sea, for originally they had actually
lived on its shores. As regards the Chasars (Khazari, Chosari) their
name is a compound with Kos +Ar + i, i.e. descendants from the
merging of (white) Aryans and (darkish) Kush peoples, as rightly
observed by the Arab writer, Abu-i-Feda, who said: "The Khazars... are
of two types: some are dark-skinned, often almost black; these are
considered as being of Hindu descent. The second race is white
skinned and exceedingly beautiful" (quoted in P 081 p. 56). In the
beginning, the Khazars dwelt on the northern shore of the Caspian
Sea, whose original 'Hyrcania' (= Aryan) name was changed into
Caspis (< H.: Kush-Viz) 'Water of the Kush'. Ail this points to the
important fact that the Turki peoples were a combination of the



subjugated Aryan and Kush population, with a significant admixture of
Mongol elements.
The first Turkish ethnic branch with which the Arpadians came into
close political union were the Khazars, as was recently demonstrated
by Arthur Koestler (P 079) and Vilmos Kovács (P 081). The Khazars
spoke the Tchuvash dialect of Turkish and had laid the foundation of
their empire in the second half of the Vlth century, more exactly in
567. They became the mightiest power in Eastern Europe in the VHth,
Vlllth and IXth centuries. They had extended their domain over the
entire area to the north of the Caucasian ranges, and subjected the
westermost seven Magyar tribes, living between the Kuban and Don
rivers, to their rule, as well as those who dwelt between the Kuma and
Terek rivers, on the western coast of the Caspian. All these Magyar
tribes living in Caucasia, originated from northern Mesopotamia, the
Kingdom of Urartu, and from the post-Hittite states of Syria, especially
from the Kingdoms of Arpad, Karkemish and Damasek (Damask).
They had to leave their old fatherlands, following the bloody
expansion of the Semitic Assyrian Empire, in the second and first
milleniums B.C. In our historical sources, the memory of the
Hungarians at the Don has been preserved under the name of Dentu
Magaria and of those of the Kuma valley as Kum-Magaria.
The Hungarians of Dentu-Magaria have been incorporated into the
Khazar Empire in 568 A.D. and their symbiosis lasted for over three
hundred years. They were entrusted with the all-important task of
safeguarding the western flank of the Khazar Empire and to block the
descent of the Slavonic peoples toward the south. To fulfill their duties
more efficaciously, the seven Magyar tribes in question were
transferred later to a more suitable location, between the Don and
Dnieper, above the Black Sea. The same strategic considerations led
the Khazars to place the Magyar tribes under a single command, for



which Arpad was selected. His installation as 'Deputy king' was carried
out according to Khazar customs, by elevating him on shields. And the
leaders of the seven tribes, for their part, swore allegiance to Arpad,
solemnly declaring that they would faithfully carry out his orders. All
that may have happened around 850, which may be considered the
birth-date of the East-European Hungarian nation, the Danubian one
having already been in existence for a long time.
The Khazar-Hungarian alliance worked well for about two hundred
years, but when the Khazar king adopted the Judaic faith around 740
and forced it upon his court and military men, the first internal
tensions were quick to appear. A civil war erupted in which the rebels
were defeated. As a result, three deeply involved Khazar tribes, called
Kabars, went over to Hungarian side and were absorbed into their
socio-political system. Then came the renewed attack of the fearful
Bisseni-Turks, who had torn away the pasture-land from the Magyars
and forced them to move more westwards (889), into the Dnieper
Seret-Lower-Dan-ube area, thereby severing their secular alliance with
the Khazars completely. At that time, they had already acquired
enough political maturity to make their own decisions as to the best
way to ensure their survival in social surroundings that were growing
more and more precarious.
Their own worry, which was also shared by the Danubian Hungarians,
gave rise in c. 890 to the idea of merging the two Hungarian nations
into one, inside the spacious Carpathian arena which could be
defended more easily than any tribal community on the unbroken,
vast plain beyond the Carpathians. In the meantime, they had to fight
a mysterious battle against the Cuman-Turks near Kiev, of which we
have no details. It is definitely known, however, that the Cumans'
seven tribes were defeated and that they swore an oath of allegiance
to Arpad and then they too were absorbed into the constantly swelling
Magyar conglomerate, which already consisted of seventeen tribes.



Finally, the descendants of Prince Csaba, the youngest son of King
Attila, also joined the Arpadians, together with their innumerable
clans and cognates of the same region. After all these happenings, the
people Arpad led into Hungary were considerably different from the
Danubian Hungarians. Racially, they were of Aryan, Kush and
Mongolian factions. By religion, they were sunworshippers,
fireadorers, Ismaelits and Moslems. Ethnically, they had strong Turkish
traits, bearing such names as Magyar, Khazar, Kabar, Kuman, Hun,
Bisseni, etc. —a real mosaic with a Turkish veneer. In the Byzantine
court they were classified simply as Turki, and not Hungarians. How
did it happen then, that they could, nevertheless, build a Hungary
with all its components and not a 'Turkey'?
4. The re-unification of the country and the birth of Hungary-II as
a modern state
1. After the destruction of the Avar-Hungarian Kingdom by the Franks
in 783-803, the whole Carpathian land relapsed into a state of
political anarchy and became a battlefield for half a dozen dukedoms
and neighbouring great powers. No wonder that the Hungarians
already in the land, had sent emissaries to their brethren on the other
side of the Carpathians, urging them to move in to rebuild, together
with their united forces, the realm of their great ancestor, King Attila.
The Arpadians received similar suggestions from the interested great
powers, namely from King Arnulf (887-899) of Germany, and the
Byzantine emperor Leo the Wise (886-912) to help achieve their own
political objectives. By this means, the Arpadians had several
opportunities of exploring their future land, especially in 862, 881 and
892. All our evidence points to the fact that the vital decision was
already taken in 892.
The preparations for the conquest were in full swing at that time. In
Kiev, where Almus, the father of Arpad was the deputy-king, all the



available blacksmiths were summoned to make hundreds of thousands
of horseshoes, arrows, cartwheels, swords and the like, which were all
kept in storage. Three hundred lumber jacks were also engaged to
clear a passage through the thick forest. A pincer movement was
planned, according to which the bulk of the invaders would penetrate
into Hungary under the leadership of Arpad through the Verecke-pass,
which had never been used before (841 m above s.-l.), and the second
army, under the command of Arpad's father Almus or his elder son
Levente, was supposed to check the Bulgarian forces and penetrate
into Transylvania through its passes and gorges. The invasion started
in the spring of 895 and, except for the unexpected attack of the
Bisseni and Bulgarians, the Hungarian armies met inside the
Carpathian arc during the summer of the same year, as planned. By
900, the entire territory was in their hands, including Transdanubia.
The incoming Arpadians were greeted as liberators and most of the
native populations surrendered spontaneously to the new master of
the land and even helped with the unification. Those few princes and
dukes who failed to change their allegiance in time, paid dearly for
their mistake. Laborci, Gelu and Zubur who resisted, were killed in
action. Two others, Salan and Glad, fled with their followers. The case
of the sixth prince, Men-marut, was a particular one, insofar as he had
wanted to resist at first, but, at the sight of Arpad's armed men, had
asked for a compromise, offering his daughter in marriage to Arpad's
youngest son Zsolt, while he himself swore obedience to Arpad. In
exchange, he was permitted to keep his stronghold of Bihar as a fief
for life. History knows of very few conquests as clean as Arpad's, which
was accomplished practically without bloodshed.
As soon as the territorial unification of the land was achieved, Arpad
summoned the leaders to his fortress of Csongrád and hammered out
the principles ('Constitution'), according to which the reunified
country was to be governed. The next step consisted of setting up



nation-wide institutions, to bind all the inhabitants of Hungary
together into indissoluble unity. These institutions were almost
exclusively, the creation of the native, and not of the half-way
Turkized Hungarians. In other words, the newcomers were culturally
absorbed into the Magyar-speaking local population which formed the
overwhelming majority in the land. This process is well illustrated by
the following remarks. The unified country became a "kingdom" (and
not a khanat according to the Turkish pattern), with a "king" as its
ruler (and not a khan or kende). The highest officials were the Maior
Domus Nádor and the Chief Justice, Ország-biró (and not Horka and
Kádár). The king was represented as someone seated upon a throne
(and not in a saddle on horseback). The symbolic animal identifying
the king was a lion (and not a hyena, ram or dog). One of the most
important institutions, which welded and kept the various elements of
the society together, resulted from the adoption of Christianity. The
new faith imposed, indeed, a common and uniform ideology, and
replaced the pagan Sun-, Fire-, and Baal-cults, which had earlier kept
the nation divided into several parts. Thus, the merging of all
Hungarians of diverse origins, creeds and political traditions into a single
nation was achieved within a relatively short lapse of time.

2. Prince Arpad (+ 907) was not only a military genius but a
successful organizer as well. He clearly perceived the geographic unity
and the strategic position of the Carpathian arena, welded between
two powerful empires. Accordingly, he did not divide the country
amongst the seven princes who were his deputies. On the contrary, he
considered the mountainous periphery of the united land as its
natural defense line and the whole country as an important element of
the European equilibrium, as set forth by the treaty of Verdun in 843.
He was, therefore, anxious to put an end to the encroachments of the
little Moravian State and incorporated its borderland into Hungary in
902.
More fighting was needed before Arpad's strategic-political conception



was recognized and accepted by the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary's
dynamic western neighbour. This empire was naturally inclined to
expand eastward along the Danube valley. The most opportune time
for the realization of its ambitions seemed to arrive with the death of
Arpad, when huge armies were dispatched on both sides of the
Danube toward Hungary. They were, however, defeated right at the
border, in the marshy region of Pozsony (Pres-burg). As a result of this
decisive Hungarian victory, the Danubian provinces of present-day
Austria were annexed by Hungary as far as the river Enns. The whole
area remained under Hungarian rule until 933, when one of their
armies was defeated near Merseburg, and again in 955, near
Augsburg. After these events, Hungary's western borders were
gradually withdrawn to the line of the Lajta and Fischa rivers, where
they were stabilized for a thousand years and mutually recognized.
After that, there was no obstacle for the participation of Hungary
under Prince Géza at the meeting of Quedlinburg (973), called in by
the German emperor Otto the Great, to discuss the common security
problems of Central Europe.(61) The memory of Hungarian rule in
Moravia has been kept alive until our days by numerous village
names, built upon the Hungarian vocable, such as Uhersky and Uhr
Sitz (7 such names), or with other Hungarian words, such as Sallash
(= Szállás), the Hungarian for 'summer dwelling'. Similarly, many
Hungarian village-names survived in the Ostmark, out of which 25
include the word 'Hungarian', such as Ungar-Bach, Ungar-Stein, Ungar
Berg, Marca Hungarica; 103 others are compounded wirh Warte-,
Schiitze and 196 are built upon Ode, meaning uninhabited land, all of
them being situated within the former defense line, as explained by
Sándor Török (P 129 p. 22f).
The relations between Hungary and the Holy See of Rome were always
cordial, as soon as the Hungarians had put their heads under the
baptismal water, thereby irrevocably becoming loyal members of the



new European community. Pope Sylvestre II together with the German
emperor Otto III, recognized Hungary as a sovereign State. As a token,
he sent a golden royal crown to the ruler, who was solemnly
proclamed 'King of Hungary" on Christmas Day of the year 1001. The
Pope's gesture was repeated later by the emperor of Byzantium, who
also recognized the sovereign status of Hungary. The two crowns were
welded together into one and symbolized the great powers' alliance
with Hungary.
The Holy See of Rome also entrusted the kings of Hungary with the
mission to defend, spread and propagate Christianity in the
neighbouring pagan countries, especially in the Balkan Peninsula,
which was full of schismatics at that time. This resulted in Hungary's
expansion toward the Adriatic Sea by including Croatia (1097),
Dalmatia (1105) and Bosnia (1210). Thus, at the end of the XIth
century and the beginning of the XIIth, not only was Hungary's sovereign
status universally recognized, but the country had become a powerful
kingdom, ranking third in importance, right after the Holy Roman and
the Byzantine Empires. So, after a successful start, Christian Hungary
was heading toward the finest hour of its history.
Thus, the period of Ancient History of the Hungarians came to a close.
5. Epilogue: The fate of the lost Hungarian tribes
After the bulk of Hungarian-speaking peoples -Scythians, Huns, Avars
and Magyars- moved out of Eastern Europe and settled in Hungary,
this race ceased to play a significant political role in the oriental part
of the continent. Ethnographi-cally, however, it continued to be
present, since numerous large factions, which were separated from
the main body, stayed behind. The reason for such detachments were
varied. First it was the general custom that migrating steppe peoples
must leave an adequate number of warriors and woman folk behind to



stand guard over the ancient land, upon which they could fall back,
should the search for new and better grazing land fail. Then, internal
political tensions may also have caused secessions. Furthermore, and
most frequently, they were exposed to enemy attacks which could cut
off thousands of people and sweep them away from the main block.
Larger Hungarian break-away tribes stayed behind in the following
areas: 1. in Caucasia, 2. in the Volga region, 3. in Touran and 4. in
Moldavia.
1. In Caucasia, the detached Hungarian tribes were those living
between the Kuma and Terek rivers, on the northwestern side of the
Caspian Sea, called Kum-Magaria. Bear witness of their tribulations
eight papal edicts (Bulls) granted between 1245 and 1291. Their texts
have been published by László Bendefy (P 010). Among the other
contemporary documents relating to the problem we can mention an
inscription carved on stone, found in the Crimean Peninsula and
deciphered by the author. Finally, tradition also deserves to be
mentioned, preserved by both the Danubian Hungarians and the
successors of Hungarians in the East. Amongst the most important
historical studies devoted to this question are the works of L. Bendefy
(P Oil) and János Boros (P 018). But in spite of this apparent richness
of documentation on this topic, many questions remain unanswered,
so that our account is still conjectural on several points.
The Caucasian Hungarians were characterized by the fact that they
lacked comprehensive political organization for a long time, having
lived in chaotic conditions, each of their clans and tribes by
themselves, in as many mini-states. With the emergence of the Mongol
threat, however, the feeling prevailed amongst them, that for their
mutual defense and survival, they must unite their forces. Accordingly,
they all placed themselves under the authority of King Yeretany. This
king wanted, above anything else, to give his kingdom a Christian
organization. Therefore, he turned for help to the Holy See, asking for



catholic priests. These antecedents led to the emission of a first papal
edict by John XXII, on behalf of the "most eminent Prince Yeretany."
We read the following passage in the said edict: "Greetings to our son
Yeretany and other Christian Hungarians (in Caucasia)... We have
understood that thou, my son Yeretany, who art a descendant from the
earliest Catholic kings of Hungary, wanted to receive, together with
other Christians of the said region... a Catholic missionary (doctorem
Catholicum desiratis habere>.)." The first "Catholic Doctor" arrived at
Magyar-on-the-Kuma in the person of Bishop Thaddeus (1331-1334).
He was followed by seven others, the last one holding office from
1366 to 1377. It is not known what became thereafter of Yeretany, but
his epitaph, found in the Crimea suggests, that he was himself a priest
and fled westwards, before the Mongol invasion. His inscription
actually reads thus: "Here is kept, by the Armenian monks, the holy
treasure of Yeretany, an Iranian lord and prince of the Don-bank. (This
treasure) consists of two church-cans. Great holiness was the
distinctive mark of this 'living God'." The dreaded onslaught of the
Mongol armies materialized in 1395/96, when the city of Magyar was
destroyed and the Kuma-Terek plain incorporated into the Kiptchak
Turk empire as a province. The few surviving Magyars then retreated
into the mountains and F. Nansen, the Norvégián explorer, was the last
European who spoke to their descendants in 1925.
2. The second and by far the largest Hungarian-speaking ethnic group,
that of the Volga Hungarians was detached from the main body
somewhere to the north of the Caspian sea in the Vlth century
following the attacks of the Turks, and was pushed northwards along
the river Volga. They were met be the imperial ambassador
Zemarchus, who talked with the "Prince of the Hungarians, who
reigned by the grace of Dizabuli khan" (On-gororum dux qui illic ex
auctoritate Dizabuli impérium habebat" (P 092 p. 93 f.). They were
then lost from sight and had no contact with any other Hungarian



group for about 600 years. They were rediscovered quasi accidentally
in 1236 by zealous Dominicans (Black Friars), who originally wanted
to find the Caucasian Hungarians, for they wanted to convert them to
the Christian faith. Four missionaries started on this venture in 1235,
via Constantinople. However, when they arrived at the city of Matrica
(the present Taman), at the entrance of the Maeotis (now Sea of
Azov), they altered their itinerary for an unknown reason and instead
of continuing eastwards, they turned directly to the north, journeying
along the west bank of the Volga. Finally, Friar Julian, the only
surviving priest, succeeded in finding a large Hungarian tribal group
"near the Great River Ethyl."
There is a report on this unique journey, written in the XHIth century
and submitted to the Holy See of Rome, where it is kept in the Record
Office. Its text is published in the collection of medieval writings
edited by Imre Szentpétery and is currently known as the "Richardus
report" (P 120 II pp. 535-542). This report describes the dramatic
encounter thus: "He (Friar Julian) found them near the great river
Ethyl ( = Volga). When they learned that he was a Christian
Hungarian, they were greatly pleased about his coming. He was
shown their houses and cottages and was pressed with questions
about the king and the realm of Christian Hungarians. To everything
he told them, about faith and other things, they listened attentively,
because their language was entirely Hungarian and they understood
him and he them (quia omnino habent Hungaricum idioma et intellige
bant eum et ipse eos'•)." Julianus then promptly returned to Hungary
to impart his important discovery to his brethren at home. In the next
year (1237), Julianus undertook a second journey to the Volga, but
was unable to reach the Ungarian settlement because the Mongolian
armies were already on the way to make new conquests. In that very
year, Hungary at the Volga had been destroyed, and the nation's ethnic
identity abolished for ever. The surviving individual Magyars were



scattered all around within a radius of about 200km, on the Volga
Heights, around the Pensa and Sura rivers, with some settlements at
Saratov, Tambov and Riazan. Today, their memory is kept alive by a
great number of place-names which include the Magyar name. The
local inhabitants remember that they have Hungarian blood in their
veins, but do not speak Hungarian any more; Turkish and/or Russian
being their language (P 019 p. 229 f.).
3. The Touranian Hungarians always lived somewhat apart from the
other Near Eastern Hungarians, to the east of the Caspian Sea, around
the Aral Sea and in the Oxus valley. In Hungarian chronicles, this is
the region which probably appears under the name of Magoria. This
ethnic group first attracted the attention of our historians in the last
century, when Kristóf Lukácsy devoted a fine work (P 092) to them in
1870. More recently, after World War II, the same area came once
again into the forefront of research, thanks to the insistence of Erik
Molnár, whose example was followed by Tibor Tóth, P.-T. Veres and Pál
Lipták, who all underscored the close connections of the Ura-lian
Hungarians with the Touranians. But it is Antal Bartha who deserves
the credit for having discovered the earliest role of the Touranians,
who were responsible for the civilization of the local population of the
Ural region and that of Western Siberia, in the Und millenium B. C.
The surviving traces of the lost Touranian Hungarians were also
carefully recorded (Kath. Magyarok Vasárnapja, January 12,1969;
Kanadai Magyarság, November 23,1968; Sorsunk, Sidney, February
13, 1960, etc.) and the villages, with 'Madiar' names, noted.
A major faction of Touranian Hungarians seem to have been swept far
away, towards southeastern Asia, into what is today New-Zealand,
where they continue to call themselves Maori (<Ma-Ur-i), i.e. Magyar.
Their existence has been discovered by F. A. Uxbond (alias Wilhelm
von Hevesy) in his sensational book, published in English in 1928 (P
130). This publication lists innumerable evidence to prove that the



Maori are closely related to the European Hungarians, both racially
and culturally. The Maori of to-day are highly civilized, but almost
entirely absorbed into their English-speaking surroundings. The
mystery of the origin of this ethnic faction has not yet been fully
elucidated, which is perhaps connected with the expansion of the
Kushan Empire.
4. Our record would not be complete without mentioning the break
away Hungarian group of Tchangos, now living in Moldavia, on the
other side of the Carpathians, near the rivers Tatros and Sereth,
numbering altogether 170,000 souls. The capital city of Moldavia is
Yassy, the Hungarian Jász-Város 'City of the Yazigues'. Their full story
is related in a recently published 1520-pages monumental
sociographic study, by Pál-Péter Domokos (P 043). The colony started
at the beginning of the Christian era, with a faction of Yazigues that
did not continue its journey into Hungary for reasons unknown to us,
but stayed behind, breaking all relations with their brethren who had
entered Hungary and settled there. The Yazigue colony of Moldavia
later received additional Hungarians, when the warlike Cuman-Turks
set up a principality in Moldavia, then Cumania. To protect Hungary
against the harassments of this pagan people, King András II (1205
1235) placed border-guards on both sides of the Carpathians, at
several points. As a further step toward their pacification, the
archbishop of Esztergom/Hungary, established missionaries in
Cumania, who converted the people to Christianity. The first bishop
had been installed at Milkó in 1227 and was followed by a new influx
of Magyars. Until 1410, five Hungarian bishoprics were erected. An
official census, carried out in the middle of the XVth century, found a
total population of 47,167 in Moldavia. Out of that number, over
20,000 were Catholic Hungarians. On the eve of World War II, the
Tchango-Magyars boasted 60 villages in the Tatros valley and 160
along the Sereth river.



When the northern corner of Moldavia, the district called Bukovina,
was annexed by the Aus-tro-Hungarian Monarchy, general András
Hadik transferred some Moldavian Hungarians into that district. Their
descendants, numbering 24,000 souls, were rapatriated into mother
land Hungary, during the second World War. All the other Tchango
Magyars continue to stay in the land, and are deprived of all cultural
facilities in their own language, not even having elementary
instruction, despite the fact that they are the native people of the land,
who settled there well before the arrival of the first Rumanians in the
XHIth century.
To sum up the sad history of the lost Hungarian tribes, we may say
that ethnographic factions, large or small, which broke away in Eastern
Europe from the main body of Hungarians, were able to retain their
identity for several centuries but most of them disappeared in the great
politico-military upheaval which was brought about by the Mongol
invasion in the XIIIth century.

1. We have reverted to the Aryan term, following the practice of many
scientists, who prefer it because its meaning is 'Men' (Wiro, Vir, Ar, Ur)
in most of the European languages (cf. P 130 p. 115).
2. The double racial origin of the Hungarians is first mentioned in the
Lacin language work of the sharp-eyed historian Deseritzky who said:
"Hunnos Magoresque gentem robustissimam et populosissimam
partim ex Japhet per Magog, partim ex Cham per Chus turn vero
Nemrothum fuisse propagatam et in unum coaluisse" (P 092 p. 79).



3. The head-shape is indicated by the cephalic index (CI). It is given in
percentage ratio (100) with the skull-width (W) and its greatest
length (L), from front to back, seen from above the head: CI= 100 X
(W:L). When its CI is 80.00 or more, the cranium is round, short or
brachy-cephalic. When CI is 75.00 or less, the cranium is long or
dolychocephalic. Between these two ranges are the meso-cephalic or
medium-headed elements.
4. E. Pittard: «Il me semble de plus en plus évident que les invasions
avares et magyares, qui apparaissent de beaucoup comme les plus
importantes, ne sont que deux
5. E. Pittard noticed the strong concentration of shortheaded Aryans
in the Ancient Near-East. He said: "En Asie, par exemple, parmi les
peuples divers que l'on a appelés les Aryens, et qui ont laissé le
souvenir de grandes civilisations, il y a beaucoup de brachycéphales,
d'Aryen brachycéphales" (P 103 p. 29).
6. It is important to keep in mind that, when our historical sources
mention the "dark" complexion of Kush, they do not always use this
word in a literal sense as 'black', but rather as opposed to white.
Further, the Kush must not be confused with Negroes, who are either
a distinct race, or a product of the jungle. Schuré insists upon this and
says: «Il faut en chercher le type supérieur non pas dans le Nègre
dégénéré, mais dans l'Abyssinien et le Nubien, en qui se conserve le
moule de cette race parvenue à son apogée» (P 114 p. 42).
7. In the first millenium A.D., almost every Eastern-Euro-pean nation
had some brownish-darkish complexioned ethnie elements in their
physical make-up. There were white and dark Huns, white and dark
Bulgars, white and dark Ugors, white and dark Chasars. It is
surprising that this all-important historical fact escaped the attention
of scientists, who persisted in believing that the adjectives White and



Dark, when employed in historical sources, in connection with ethnic
names, would signify the basic points: East and West, i.e. the
geographic position of the respective peoples. This is, of course, a
misinterpretation.
8. Chronicler Simon de Kéza accurately reflects the general feeling of
Hungarians against the dark coloured population by saying: "Gentes
siquidem in eadem (i.e. in Scythia) procreate otia complectuntur,
vanitatibus de-dite, nature dedignantis actibus venereis intendentes,
rapiñas amant, generaliter colore plus nigre quam albe" (P 120 I p.
252).
9. Former linguists and historians were inclined to consider the Kush
population as of Old Turkish extraction. It was, however, impossible to
find a fitting Turkish branch, or to determine the specific geographic
area where contacts between Hungarians and Turks might have taken
place. Above all, the beginning of the Kush-Hungarian relations
antedates the existence of any Turkish people. Therefore, the idea of
early Turkish-Hungarian connections had to be abandoned (see Prof.
Benko in P 009 p. 50).
10. The same opinion was expressed in a most recent German
language publication by Ferenc Kemény: "(Dass) das Ungarische
einerseits allen eurasischen Sprachen als Grundlage gedient hat,
andererseits eine echte Ursprache ist, deren Ursprung aus dem
heutigen Bestand derselben eindeutig erklaert werden kann (P 078 p.
115; see ibiden pp. 50, 61).
11. That Hungarian is an Aryan tongue par excellence, was stated
time and again by a number of linguists; most emphatically be Kristóf
Lukácsy, who said this: "When I say that Hungarian belongs to the
Aryan class of languages, I am summarizing the results of my
investigations of several years, conducted in the field of Hungarian



linguistics and antiquities" (P 092 p. 199).
12. "Aryan is the terminus technicus describing one of the great
language-groups extending from India to Europe" (P 038; see also
P133 and P 132). - Formerly, by mistake, the European languages
were collectively classified as Aryan. But their names do not include
the distinctive vocable Ari. Their kinship is based only upon the word
stock present in their substratum. — For the Aryan term, see also P
091 pp. 27-30; and Encycl. Britannica, ed. 1947, t. II p. 494.
13. "Ihm (Illitch-Switytch) war es gelungen, das System der
Lautentsprechungen zwischen den indoeuropäischen, den uralischen,
den altaischen... der khartweli-schen, den hamito-semitischen und
den dravidischen Sprachen zu erkennen. Diese Lautentsprechungen
beziehen sich auf Hunderte von Wortwurzeln einer eura-sischen
Ursprache deren man die Bezeichnung 'nostra-tisch' oder 'boreisch'
gab, — writes Dolgopolski in his German language account (P 042).
— See also the Hungarian complement to this study by Gy. Hary in
Valóság (Budapest, October 1976, p. 177). - Dolgopolski continues
thus: "Als Urheimat der boreischen Sprache, kommt nach allem, was
wir heute wissen, der Raum von Indien, und von Kaukasien bis zum
Persischen Golf, in Frage." - "Die boreische Sprachgemeinschaft muss
demnach in der mittleren Steinzeit, vor Beginn der Jungsteinzeit,
bestanden haben..." (P 042).
14. «Le nom du peuple Aryen reste jusqu'à présent sans explication
certaine» (P 091 p. 75).
15. Bird-headed statuettes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia
already from the time of the Flood (P 006 I p. 56). In Hungary too,
bird-headed bone-sticks have been found on several sites (P 050 p.
258).
16. Most of the Oriental place - and ethnic names with a Hungarian



meaning have been collected from the following five publications: P
013; P 021; P 024; P 044; and P 085. Some others were found in the
works of Herodotus, Dauzat, Uxbond, Saks, etc.
17. Toppeltinus: "...etiamnum vocantur Magori. Ingens populus et ipsi

18. L.A. Waddell comments Barat-Varsha thus: "The Land of the Barats
(Barat Varsha) a name synonymous with 'Barat Ana' or 'Land of the
Barats', which I have proved to be the original form of the name 'Brit
Ain' as given to Albion about 1100 B.C. by... the same Aryan race of
Barats... who civilized India and the Ganges valley" (P 132 bis p. 10);
see also the entry under 'Barata Varsha' in P 044).
19. "They called it /Egypt/ the land of Mezor ( = Magyar) and the
land of Cham / = Kush/ from their two ancestors, which the Greek
rendered Mesora and Chamia" (P 023 p. 298). — The same idea is
expressed in the following quotation "Throughout the early dynastic
period and the Old Kingdom /of Egypt/ Set (= the dark ruler ) and
Horus (the Aryan ruler) are represented as the two patron-deities of
the Monarchy" (John Van Saters, The Hyksos, London 1966 p. 98).
20. The transliteration of carved signs into Roman characters is
usually done 1. with capital letters for the graphically expressed
sounds; and 2. with small characters for the sounds supplied by the
decipherer. And 3. in our transliterations a dot is inserted between the
elements of every combined sound-sign. 4. The omitted consonants or
words are given in parentheses (), while 5. the broken-off and missing
signs are in brackets /.../.
21. The word Pogány 'Pagan' originates from the Latin Pagus 'Village'
and Paganus 'Villager', signifying 'People living in the countryside.' In
the Middle Ages, the same word was, however, used in a pejorative
sense to say 'uneducated, backward, despicable', especially when



speaking of non-Christian people. The alternative word for Pagan is
Heathen. It is probably derived from the Old Hungarian word Héth
'Seven', a shortened from of the expression 'Follower of the Seven
Great Gods.'
22. Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of the cruel
treatment King St. Stephen inflicted upon Thonuzoba who "stubbornly
adhering to his beliefs, was unwilling to become a Christian, and was
buried alive with his wife" (P 120 I p. 117). A similar cruel
punishment was imposed upon a woman, Raski by name, who was
prominent in a heathen uprising: "(She) was captured by the very
Christian King Béla and confined in prison until she ate her own feet,
and also died in the same place" (P 120 I p. 398). Persecutions of
adherents to the old faith continued until about the middle of the
XHIth century, the last dreaded inquisitor having been Johannes
Theuthon (+1252), commissioner of the Holy See to several Central
European states (P 047).
23. King Saint Stephen mentions in his gift-charter granted to the
nuns of Veszprém-Valley: "Ibi stat meta lapidea, que volgo Baluan
vocatur," "There stands a boundary-stone, called Idol by the local
population." ― Similarly, King András I ordered in his edict of 1047:
"Falsos deos abrogare et Simulacra demoliri", "to suppress the false
gods and to destroy the idols" (P 082 p. 367).
24. A witness who attended a meeting of wise-men, testified before
the Christian inquisitor by saying: "Wiseman Bansa climbed to the top
of a high ladder, stayed there for a while, chatting with God and, back
on earth, he foretold the future to his audience" (P 047 p. 56).
25. "Each time a Pharaoh was conceived, Ra was said to have returned
to earth to espouse the queen' (P 045 p. 50).
26. The corresponding passage by Anonymus reads thus: "matri eius



pregnanti per sompnium apparuit divina visio in forma Asturis que
quasi veniens earn gravidavit et innotuit ei quod de utero eius
egrederetur torrens et de limbis eius reges gloriosi propagarentur" (P
120 I p. 38).
27. "erat enim ipse Almus facie decorus sed niger, nigros habebat
oculos sed magnos, statura longus et gracilis, manus vero habebat
grossas et digitos prolixos" (P 120 I p. 38).
28. The grandson of Prince Arpad, Taksony, was of white complexion,
while Arpad's great-grandson took after him: "He had beautiful big
eyes and soft dark hair". Certain kings of the dynasty were of very
high stature, as, for example, St. Stephen, King András I, St. Ladislas
and King Béla III.
29. Prof. Gardiner states that the Egyptian Arpad may have been
"perhaps the first to become ruler upon earth over the autochthonous
Egyptians, after whom followed Osiris and the Horus" (P 052 p.
*110).
30. See the following references: P 052 I pp. *14 - *19, "103 and
*108; and P 026 II 94 - 100, 109, 153 and 374. -If the Sumerian name
for Earth was also Pat, Pot, the Sumerian ruler's title Pat-Esi (=H. Föld
Őse) also meant 'Land Ancestor' or 'Land Lord'.
31. Many rulers of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty had throne-names
with a clear Oriental meaning, and this explains why certain names
appear so often, like István (five times) and Béla (four times). In the
Old Hungarian spelling István or Están was the word for Isten 'God'.
Béla (in O.H. Bala, Baal, Bika) was the Syrian name for Great-God.
They were used in an abridged form, all bearing testimony that their
wearers were 'Living Gods', i.e. Gods on Earth, exactly as was the
practice in the Ancient Orient.



32. Babylon was surrounded by seven walls; the Mesopotamian
Ziggurat had seven floors; Mesopotamian noblemen wore seven
ruffled kilts; Egypt had seven great gods; the Egyptian Heaven had
seven divisions; the Hittite Empire (the Biblical Héth) started with the
fusion of seven lands; the Etruscan nation began with the federation
of seven cities; Rome was built on seven hills; etc. etc.
33. According to Prof. Áldásy, the double-cross cannot be considered
an apostolic cross; this latter was always a single cross (P 001 p. 63).
Thus, he indirectly admits the pre-Christian origin of this important
symbol.
34. The best edition of the medieval national chronicles is that of
Emericus Szentpétery, former professor at Budapest University (F 120
I-II).
35. "Et primus rex Scythiae fuit Magog filius Japhet, et gens ilia a
Magog rege vocata est Moger", ― writes Anonymus (P 120 I p. 35).
36. On these conflicting views see, particularly, the Chroni-con Pictum
(P 120 I pp. 243-250, and the Hungarian translation: P 053 pp. 35
37).
37. No Hungarian historian has taken notice until now that Egyptian
literature also know of a hunting hero, Onuris by name (like the
Hungarian Hunor), who had a mate called Mehit, 'lioness'. See the
somewhat confused passage in P 032 p. 227, which reads: "His
(Onuris') cult figure was a man wearing a long skirt, his feet poised
well apart, to enable him to aim a spear downwards at some
monstrous foe. His worship was centred in Thinis, a district which also
included Abydos." The Coffin Texts, III 334 j. are given as reference.
38. The original wording is thus: 'Ubi propter intemperiem illius zonae
sunt serpentes diversi generis, ranae velut porci, basilisci, et plura



animalia toxicata; tigris et unicornis ibi generantur." Where gold,
silver and pearls are also to be found (P 120 I p. 253. See also P 130
p. 164, where another location is suggested).
39. This is the opinion of many international authorities, like C.
Dawson who writes this: "It is certainly in the Danubian region that
we find (in Europe) the most complete and typical example of any
early peasant culture" (P 039 p. 53). And H. T. Waterbolk: "(Toward
3000 B.C.), the Hungarian Plain was a dominant centre which had
incorporated all the major achievements of the nuclear area in the
Near East and which had added to these an adaptation to the
European deciduous forest" (P 134).
40. for the westward diffusion of the Hungarian Neolithic and Bronze
Age civilizations see, in addition to the quoted references in the text,
in particular P 039 pp. 51 and 169.
41. In the light of the etymology given there, we have to abandon the
fantastic explanation of the Greek writers of the past, who believed
that the Italian Siculi were governed by One-Eyed Giants, interpreting
the Syc-Lo-Pe expression as being the Greek word Cyclops.
42. Thukydides relates that "the country owes its name of Italy to
Italus, a king of Sicel, so called." Now, Ital, as a Hungarian word,
means a 'drink', and Italos somebody 'fond of alcoholic drink'. The
explanation seems to be a fitting one, because the early Sicels are said
to have been fond of wine, which they drank in the Scythian fashion,
i.e. unmixed with water (P 067 Book VI cap. 84 and Book I cap. 106).
― Incidentally, the Greek name of Sungod, Apollo, is, in their
language, a Hungarian loan-word, made up with Pe + Ló, and the
prefixed definitive article A, whence A Pe-Lo, contracted into Apollo,
literally means 'The Chief Horse'.
43. Prof. Hood is reluctant to see actual writing upon the tablets: "But



do the Tartaria ( = Tatárlaka) tablets actually bear writing? Probably
not... It seems quite possible that they were merely an
uncomprehending imitation of more civilized peoples' written
records... a pretense by some illiterate barbarian to command the
magic embodied in an art he had witnessed but did not understand"
(P 068).
44. The calendar was a precious instrument in the hands of every
farming community of the Antiquity. It enabled the peasants to know
the most appropriate time to carry out certain important tasks, such as
plowing and sowing in particular and it was also useful for the timing
of religious festivals.
45. In Atlantic Europe, the observation of the various seasonal
positions of the Sun, in reference to the zodiacal star-clusters, was
made with the help of heavy megalith-ic structures (e.g. Stonehenge).
In the Danubian region, the more advanced microlithic structure
prevailed. This is the significant difference between the two halves of
Europe, although this has never been pointed out until now.
46. The step-by-step explanation of the inscription is thus: in the
second compartment we can distinguish the rising Sun, in Hungarian
A Nap. On its right side, the contours of a mouse (H.: Az Egér) are
visible, with its thin, long tail. The picture of this animal is here
because it is homophonous with the expression Az Égre, 'to the sky'.
So, the thus far deciphered words say this: A Nap az Égre 'The Sun to
the sky'. After that, we read the signs placed in the left and right
columns, saying: the cross sign iT, the crab A RÁK, followed by a sign
for the sound-group KUR/KOR, and finally the word for donkey IÁ. In
modern Hungarian: Itt a rákkor jö 'Comes at this spot in the Cancer
constellation'. The directive continues in the third compartment thus:
aN-aP Je-Le aR-áK öV-Be... 'The day's symbol in the Cancer zone is...
The complete message in better English reads: 'Here (at Tatárlaka) the



Sun appears on the horizon in the Cancer constellation on the day of...
― The homophony existing between 'Sky God' (Az Égúr) and the
mouse (Az Egér) was probably the origin of the never-explained
Oriental custom of keeping white mice in Sun-temples, as was the
case in Babylon and Egypt. The presence of these small animals was a
mean amongst a hundred others, to remind the believers that God
may hide himself in any of his creatures to watch over their behaviour.
47. «La science considére aujourd'hui que les Celtes ne constituent pas
une race, dans le sens propre du terme mais ont toujours été un
groupe de peuples, formánt un agrégat de types du point de vue
anthropologique» (P 057 p. 10; and see P 070 I p. X and P 132 p.
128).
48. The thesis of the linguistic unity of Celtic Europe is stressed by
almost every author, as for example P 037 p. 12; P 057 pp. 10-12; P
070 I pp. 49, 51. The hundred million Celts are mentioned in the
publication P 057 p. 11.
49. Henri Hubert consoles himself by saying: «Rien d'étonnant que ces
noms soient difficile á expliquer et que leur sens etymologique se soit
évanoui» (P 070 I p. 27 f.).
50. "Erat enim rex Ethele colore teter, oculis nigris et furiosis, pectore
lato, elatus incessu, statura brevis, barbam prolixam gum Hunnis
deferebat" (P 120 I p. 151).
51. Author Agathias writing about the Hunnorum Gens says this: "Hi
vero omnes communiter Scythae et Hunni vocabantur, privátim
autem, secundum nationes alii aliter ex patria cuique et usita
appellatione nominaban-tur", quoted by P 092 p. 130.
52. "Mensa erat tota aurea, vasa etiam coquinaria aurea erant",
records Simon de Kéza (P 120 I p. 262).



53. Clenodia aurea que a tempore regis Ungariae Attila et ab aliis
successoribus suis usque nunc in Ungaria fuerant conservata" (P 099
p. 187 f.).
54. It should be noted, once again, that the ancient royal Egyptian
symbols also included the bird, the whip and the bee.
55. Incidentally, ancient Egyptian kings had the same custom: "The
warrior kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties were pleased when
the court scribes related in commemorative inscriptions how their
lords raged and roared like lions as they mounted their chariots and
set out to crush the foolish enemy" (P 026 I p. 25 f.)
56. "Sie besassen keine Sprache, sondern stiessen kurze, rauhe Laute
aus, wie Tiere auf der Flucht" (P 113 p. 17).
57. "Sie sind treuer and harter als die Germanen, sie kennen nichts als
den König" (P 113 p. 130).
58. "Der Name Attila ist heute zweifelsfrei als Germanisch 'Váterchen'
erkannt", Die Presse, Stuttgart, 20, May 1975.
59. The Swiss anthropologist E. Pittard was one of the first scientists
to suspect the close affinity of the early inhabitants of Hungary. He
said: «I1 est probable, á voir les caractéres morphologiques des
habitants de la Hongrie, que parmi les peuples qui arrivaient de l'Est,
il y en avait plusieurs qui étaient puisés aux mémes fonds ethniques
que les Magyars eux-mémes» (P 103 p. 341).
60. Several examples can be listed to prove that Horse (Lau) was used
to say Ra, the Sungod. In the Zagros mountains, to the east of
Mesopotamia, there was a small country called Lauristan (<H.: Ló-Ur
Isten), 'Land placed under the protection of the Horse-Lordgod' i.e.
Sungod. It was the unique task of the Scythians who lived in that



country to raise horses for the Persian armies. Their popular art was
also overladen with horse representations. — Another example: The
Armenian bishop, Israyel, who travelled into the land of the Huns and
described their beliefs, said this: "The Huns worshipped their highest
divinity in the form of a giant warrior, mounted on horseback" (P 081
p. 65). - The Hungarian AU sound usually changes into 0, as in the
city-name of Iglau, which is in modern Hungarian, Igló.
61. Originally, the eastern border lands of Germany (the future
Austria) were a creation of Frankish rulers. They were re-established
later, as duchies of Carinthia (976), Carniola (1040), Styria (1055)
and Ostmark (1156).

____________________
1. We have reverted to the Aryan term, following the practice of many
scientists, who prefer it because its meaning is 'Men' (Wiro, Vir, Ar, Ur)
in most of the European languages (cf. P 130 p. 115).
2. The double racial origin of the Hungarians is first mentioned in the
Lacin language work of the sharp-eyed historian Deseritzky who said:
"Hunnos Magoresque gentem robustissimam et populosissimam
partim ex Japhet per Magog, partim ex Cham per Chus turn vero
Nemrothum fuisse propagatam et in unum coaluisse" (P 092 p. 79).
3. The head-shape is indicated by the cephalic index (CI). It is given in
percentage ratio (100) with the skull-width (W) and its greatest
length (L), from front to back, seen from above the head: CI= 100 X
(W:L). When its CI is 80.00 or more, the cranium is round, short or
brachy-cephalic. When CI is 75.00 or less, the cranium is long or
dolychocephalic. Between these two ranges are the meso-cephalic or
medium-headed elements.
4. E. Pittard: «Il me semble de plus en plus évident que les invasions
avares et magyares, qui apparaissent de beaucoup comme les plus
importantes, ne sont que deux
5. E. Pittard noticed the strong concentration of shortheaded Aryans
in the Ancient Near-East. He said: "En Asie, par exemple, parmi les
peuples divers que l'on a appelés les Aryens, et qui ont laissé le
souvenir de grandes civilisations, il y a beaucoup de brachycéphales,



d'Aryen brachycéphales" (P 103 p. 29).
6. It is important to keep in mind that, when our historical sources
mention the "dark" complexion of Kush, they do not always use this
word in a literal sense as 'black', but rather as opposed to white.
Further, the Kush must not be confused with Negroes, who are either
a distinct race, or a product of the jungle. Schuré insists upon this and
says: «Il faut en chercher le type supérieur non pas dans le Nègre
dégénéré, mais dans l'Abyssinien et le Nubien, en qui se conserve le
moule de cette race parvenue à son apogée» (P 114 p. 42).
7. In the first millenium A.D., almost every Eastern-Euro-pean nation
had some brownish-darkish complexioned ethnie elements in their
physical make-up. There were white and dark Huns, white and dark
Bulgars, white and dark Ugors, white and dark Chasars. It is
surprising that this all-important historical fact escaped the attention
of scientists, who persisted in believing that the adjectives White and
Dark, when employed in historical sources, in connection with ethnic
names, would signify the basic points: East and West, i.e. the
geographic position of the respective peoples. This is, of course, a
misinterpretation.
8. Chronicler Simon de Kéza accurately reflects the general feeling of
Hungarians against the dark coloured population by saying: "Gentes
siquidem in eadem (i.e. in Scythia) procreate otia complectuntur,
vanitatibus de-dite, nature dedignantis actibus venereis intendentes,
rapiñas amant, generaliter colore plus nigre quam albe" (P 120 I p.
252).
9. Former linguists and historians were inclined to consider the Kush
population as of Old Turkish extraction. It was, however, impossible to
find a fitting Turkish branch, or to determine the specific geographic
area where contacts between Hungarians and Turks might have taken



place. Above all, the beginning of the Kush-Hungarian relations
antedates the existence of any Turkish people. Therefore, the idea of
early Turkish-Hungarian connections had to be abandoned (see Prof.
Benko in P 009 p. 50).
10. The same opinion was expressed in a most recent German
language publication by Ferenc Kemény: "(Dass) das Ungarische
einerseits allen eurasischen Sprachen als Grundlage gedient hat,
andererseits eine echte Ursprache ist, deren Ursprung aus dem
heutigen Bestand derselben eindeutig erklaert werden kann (P 078 p.
115; see ibiden pp. 50, 61).
11. That Hungarian is an Aryan tongue par excellence, was stated
time and again by a number of linguists; most emphatically be Kristóf
Lukácsy, who said this: "When I say that Hungarian belongs to the
Aryan class of languages, I am summarizing the results of my
investigations of several years, conducted in the field of Hungarian
linguistics and antiquities" (P 092 p. 199).
12. "Aryan is the terminus technicus describing one of the great
language-groups extending from India to Europe" (P 038; see also
P133 and P 132). - Formerly, by mistake, the European languages
were collectively classified as Aryan. But their names do not include
the distinctive vocable Ari. Their kinship is based only upon the word
stock present in their substratum. — For the Aryan term, see also P
091 pp. 27-30; and Encycl. Britannica, ed. 1947, t. II p. 494.
13. "Ihm (Illitch-Switytch) war es gelungen, das System der
Lautentsprechungen zwischen den indoeuropäischen, den uralischen,
den altaischen... der khartweli-schen, den hamito-semitischen und
den dravidischen Sprachen zu erkennen. Diese Lautentsprechungen
beziehen sich auf Hunderte von Wortwurzeln einer eura-sischen
Ursprache deren man die Bezeichnung 'nostra-tisch' oder 'boreisch'



gab, — writes Dolgopolski in his German language account (P 042).
— See also the Hungarian complement to this study by Gy. Hary in
Valóság (Budapest, October 1976, p. 177). - Dolgopolski continues
thus: "Als Urheimat der boreischen Sprache, kommt nach allem, was
wir heute wissen, der Raum von Indien, und von Kaukasien bis zum
Persischen Golf, in Frage." - "Die boreische Sprachgemeinschaft muss
demnach in der mittleren Steinzeit, vor Beginn der Jungsteinzeit,
bestanden haben..." (P 042).
14. «Le nom du peuple Aryen reste jusqu'à présent sans explication
certaine» (P 091 p. 75).
15. Bird-headed statuettes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia
already from the time of the Flood (P 006 I p. 56). In Hungary too,
bird-headed bone-sticks have been found on several sites (P 050 p.
258).
16. Most of the Oriental place - and ethnic names with a Hungarian
meaning have been collected from the following five publications: P
013; P 021; P 024; P 044; and P 085. Some others were found in the
works of Herodotus, Dauzat, Uxbond, Saks, etc.
17. Toppeltinus: "...etiamnum vocantur Magori. Ingens populus et ipsi
armorum gloria inclytum regnum possi-dent" (P 092 pp. 98, 203).
18. L.A. Waddell comments Barat-Varsha thus: "The Land of the Barats
(Barat Varsha) a name synonymous with 'Barat Ana' or 'Land of the
Barats', which I have proved to be the original form of the name 'Brit
Ain' as given to Albion about 1100 B.C. by... the same Aryan race of
Barats... who civilized India and the Ganges valley" (P 132 bis p. 10);
see also the entry under 'Barata Varsha' in P 044).
19. "They called it /Egypt/ the land of Mezor ( = Magyar) and the
land of Cham / = Kush/ from their two ancestors, which the Greek



rendered Mesora and Chamia" (P 023 p. 298). — The same idea is
expressed in the following quotation "Throughout the early dynastic
period and the Old Kingdom /of Egypt/ Set (= the dark ruler ) and
Horus (the Aryan ruler) are represented as the two patron-deities of
the Monarchy" (John Van Saters, The Hyksos, London 1966 p. 98).
20. The transliteration of carved signs into Roman characters is
usually done 1. with capital letters for the graphically expressed
sounds; and 2. with small characters for the sounds supplied by the
decipherer. And 3. in our transliterations a dot is inserted between the
elements of every combined sound-sign. 4. The omitted consonants or
words are given in parentheses (), while 5. the broken-off and missing
signs are in brackets /.../.
21. The word Pogány 'Pagan' originates from the Latin Pagus 'Village'
and Paganus 'Villager', signifying 'People living in the countryside.' In
the Middle Ages, the same word was, however, used in a pejorative
sense to say 'uneducated, backward, despicable', especially when
speaking of non-Christian people. The alternative word for Pagan is
Heathen. It is probably derived from the Old Hungarian word Héth
'Seven', a shortened from of the expression 'Follower of the Seven
Great Gods.'
22. Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of the cruel
treatment King St. Stephen inflicted upon Thonuzoba who "stubbornly
adhering to his beliefs, was unwilling to become a Christian, and was
buried alive with his wife" (P 120 I p. 117). A similar cruel
punishment was imposed upon a woman, Raski by name, who was
prominent in a heathen uprising: "(She) was captured by the very
Christian King Béla and confined in prison until she ate her own feet,
and also died in the same place" (P 120 I p. 398). Persecutions of
adherents to the old faith continued until about the middle of the
XHIth century, the last dreaded inquisitor having been Johannes



Theuthon (+1252), commissioner of the Holy See to several Central
European states (P 047).
23. King Saint Stephen mentions in his gift-charter granted to the
nuns of Veszprém-Valley: "Ibi stat meta lapidea, que volgo Baluan
vocatur," "There stands a boundary-stone, called Idol by the local
population." ― Similarly, King András I ordered in his edict of 1047:
"Falsos deos abrogare et Simulacra demoliri", "to suppress the false
gods and to destroy the idols" (P 082 p. 367).
24. A witness who attended a meeting of wise-men, testified before
the Christian inquisitor by saying: "Wiseman Bansa climbed to the top
of a high ladder, stayed there for a while, chatting with God and, back
on earth, he foretold the future to his audience" (P 047 p. 56).
25. "Each time a Pharaoh was conceived, Ra was said to have returned
to earth to espouse the queen' (P 045 p. 50).
26. The corresponding passage by Anonymus reads thus: "matri eius
pregnanti per sompnium apparuit divina visio in forma Asturis que
quasi veniens earn gravidavit et innotuit ei quod de utero eius
egrederetur torrens et de limbis eius reges gloriosi propagarentur" (P
120 I p. 38).
27. "erat enim ipse Almus facie decorus sed niger, nigros habebat
oculos sed magnos, statura longus et gracilis, manus vero habebat
grossas et digitos prolixos" (P 120 I p. 38).
28. The grandson of Prince Arpad, Taksony, was of white complexion,
while Arpad's great-grandson took after him: "He had beautiful big
eyes and soft dark hair". Certain kings of the dynasty were of very
high stature, as, for example, St. Stephen, King András I, St. Ladislas
and King Béla III.



29. Prof. Gardiner states that the Egyptian Arpad may have been
"perhaps the first to become ruler upon earth over the autochthonous
Egyptians, after whom followed Osiris and the Horus" (P 052 p.
*110).
30. See the following references: P 052 I pp. *14 - *19, "103 and
*108; and P 026 II 94 - 100, 109, 153 and 374. -If the Sumerian name
for Earth was also Pat, Pot, the Sumerian ruler's title Pat-Esi (=H. Föld
Őse) also meant 'Land Ancestor' or 'Land Lord'.
31. Many rulers of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty had throne-names
with a clear Oriental meaning, and this explains why certain names
appear so often, like István (five times) and Béla (four times). In the
Old Hungarian spelling István or Están was the word for Isten 'God'.
Béla (in O.H. Bala, Baal, Bika) was the Syrian name for Great-God.
They were used in an abridged form, all bearing testimony that their
wearers were 'Living Gods', i.e. Gods on Earth, exactly as was the
practice in the Ancient Orient.
32. Babylon was surrounded by seven walls; the Mesopotamian
Ziggurat had seven floors; Mesopotamian noblemen wore seven
ruffled kilts; Egypt had seven great gods; the Egyptian Heaven had
seven divisions; the Hittite Empire (the Biblical Héth) started with the
fusion of seven lands; the Etruscan nation began with the federation
of seven cities; Rome was built on seven hills; etc. etc.
33. According to Prof. Áldásy, the double-cross cannot be considered
an apostolic cross; this latter was always a single cross (P 001 p. 63).
Thus, he indirectly admits the pre-Christian origin of this important
symbol.
34. The best edition of the medieval national chronicles is that of
Emericus Szentpétery, former professor at Budapest University (F 120
I-II).



35. "Et primus rex Scythiae fuit Magog filius Japhet, et gens ilia a
Magog rege vocata est Moger", ― writes Anonymus (P 120 I p. 35).
36. On these conflicting views see, particularly, the Chroni-con Pictum
(P 120 I pp. 243-250, and the Hungarian translation: P 053 pp. 35
37).
37. No Hungarian historian has taken notice until now that Egyptian
literature also know of a hunting hero, Onuris by name (like the
Hungarian Hunor), who had a mate called Mehit, 'lioness'. See the
somewhat confused passage in P 032 p. 227, which reads: "His
(Onuris') cult figure was a man wearing a long skirt, his feet poised
well apart, to enable him to aim a spear downwards at some
monstrous foe. His worship was centred in Thinis, a district which also
included Abydos." The Coffin Texts, III 334 j. are given as reference.
38. The original wording is thus: 'Ubi propter intemperiem illius zonae
sunt serpentes diversi generis, ranae velut porci, basilisci, et plura
animalia toxicata; tigris et unicornis ibi generantur." Where gold,
silver and pearls are also to be found (P 120 I p. 253. See also P 130
p. 164, where another location is suggested).
39. This is the opinion of many international authorities, like C.
Dawson who writes this: "It is certainly in the Danubian region that
we find (in Europe) the most complete and typical example of any
early peasant culture" (P 039 p. 53). And H. T. Waterbolk: "(Toward
3000 B.C.), the Hungarian Plain was a dominant centre which had
incorporated all the major achievements of the nuclear area in the
Near East and which had added to these an adaptation to the
European deciduous forest" (P 134).
40. for the westward diffusion of the Hungarian Neolithic and Bronze
Age civilizations see, in addition to the quoted references in the text,
in particular P 039 pp. 51 and 169.



41. In the light of the etymology given there, we have to abandon the
fantastic explanation of the Greek writers of the past, who believed
that the Italian Siculi were governed by One-Eyed Giants, interpreting
the Syc-Lo-Pe expression as being the Greek word Cyclops.
42. Thukydides relates that "the country owes its name of Italy to
Italus, a king of Sicel, so called." Now, Ital, as a Hungarian word,
means a 'drink', and Italos somebody 'fond of alcoholic drink'. The
explanation seems to be a fitting one, because the early Sicels are said
to have been fond of wine, which they drank in the Scythian fashion,
i.e. unmixed with water (P 067 Book VI cap. 84 and Book I cap. 106).
― Incidentally, the Greek name of Sungod, Apollo, is, in their
language, a Hungarian loan-word, made up with Pe + Ló, and the
prefixed definitive article A, whence A Pe-Lo, contracted into Apollo,
literally means 'The Chief Horse'.
43. Prof. Hood is reluctant to see actual writing upon the tablets: "But
do the Tartaria ( = Tatárlaka) tablets actually bear writing? Probably
not... It seems quite possible that they were merely an
uncomprehending imitation of more civilized peoples' written
records... a pretense by some illiterate barbarian to command the
magic embodied in an art he had witnessed but did not understand"
(P 068).
44. The calendar was a precious instrument in the hands of every
farming community of the Antiquity. It enabled the peasants to know
the most appropriate time to carry out certain important tasks, such as
plowing and sowing in particular and it was also useful for the timing
of religious festivals.
45. In Atlantic Europe, the observation of the various seasonal
positions of the Sun, in reference to the zodiacal star-clusters, was
made with the help of heavy megalith-ic structures (e.g. Stonehenge).



In the Danubian region, the more advanced microlithic structure
prevailed. This is the significant difference between the two halves of
Europe, although this has never been pointed out until now.
46. The step-by-step explanation of the inscription is thus: in the
second compartment we can distinguish the rising Sun, in Hungarian
A Nap. On its right side, the contours of a mouse (H.: Az Egér) are
visible, with its thin, long tail. The picture of this animal is here
because it is homophonous with the expression Az Égre, 'to the sky'.
So, the thus far deciphered words say this: A Nap az Égre 'The Sun to
the sky'. After that, we read the signs placed in the left and right
columns, saying: the cross sign iT, the crab A RÁK, followed by a sign
for the sound-group KUR/KOR, and finally the word for donkey IÁ. In
modern Hungarian: Itt a rákkor jö 'Comes at this spot in the Cancer
constellation'. The directive continues in the third compartment thus:
aN-aP Je-Le aR-áK öV-Be... 'The day's symbol in the Cancer zone is...
The complete message in better English reads: 'Here (at Tatárlaka) the
Sun appears on the horizon in the Cancer constellation on the day of...
― The homophony existing between 'Sky God' (Az Égúr) and the
mouse (Az Egér) was probably the origin of the never-explained
Oriental custom of keeping white mice in Sun-temples, as was the
case in Babylon and Egypt. The presence of these small animals was a
mean amongst a hundred others, to remind the believers that God
may hide himself in any of his creatures to watch over their behaviour.
47. «La science considére aujourd'hui que les Celtes ne constituent pas
une race, dans le sens propre du terme mais ont toujours été un
groupe de peuples, formánt un agrégat de types du point de vue
anthropologique» (P 057 p. 10; and see P 070 I p. X and P 132 p.
128).
48. The thesis of the linguistic unity of Celtic Europe is stressed by
almost every author, as for example P 037 p. 12; P 057 pp. 10-12; P



070 I pp. 49, 51. The hundred million Celts are mentioned in the
publication P 057 p. 11.
49. Henri Hubert consoles himself by saying: «Rien d'étonnant que ces
noms soient difficile á expliquer et que leur sens etymologique se soit
évanoui» (P 070 I p. 27 f.).
50. "Erat enim rex Ethele colore teter, oculis nigris et furiosis, pectore
lato, elatus incessu, statura brevis, barbam prolixam gum Hunnis
deferebat" (P 120 I p. 151).
51. Author Agathias writing about the Hunnorum Gens says this: "Hi
vero omnes communiter Scythae et Hunni vocabantur, privátim
autem, secundum nationes alii aliter ex patria cuique et usita
appellatione nominaban-tur", quoted by P 092 p. 130.
52. "Mensa erat tota aurea, vasa etiam coquinaria aurea erant",
records Simon de Kéza (P 120 I p. 262).
53. Clenodia aurea que a tempore regis Ungariae Attila et ab aliis
successoribus suis usque nunc in Ungaria fuerant conservata" (P 099
p. 187 f.).
54. It should be noted, once again, that the ancient royal Egyptian
symbols also included the bird, the whip and the bee.
55. Incidentally, ancient Egyptian kings had the same custom: "The
warrior kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties were pleased when
the court scribes related in commemorative inscriptions how their
lords raged and roared like lions as they mounted their chariots and
set out to crush the foolish enemy" (P 026 I p. 25 f.)
56. "Sie besassen keine Sprache, sondern stiessen kurze, rauhe Laute
aus, wie Tiere auf der Flucht" (P 113 p. 17).



57. "Sie sind treuer and harter als die Germanen, sie kennen nichts als
den König" (P 113 p. 130).
58. "Der Name Attila ist heute zweifelsfrei als Germanisch 'Váterchen'
erkannt", Die Presse, Stuttgart, 20, May 1975.
59. The Swiss anthropologist E. Pittard was one of the first scientists
to suspect the close affinity of the early inhabitants of Hungary. He
said: «I1 est probable, á voir les caractéres morphologiques des
habitants de la Hongrie, que parmi les peuples qui arrivaient de l'Est,
il y en avait plusieurs qui étaient puisés aux mémes fonds ethniques
que les Magyars eux-mémes» (P 103 p. 341).
60. Several examples can be listed to prove that Horse (Lau) was used
to say Ra, the Sungod. In the Zagros mountains, to the east of
Mesopotamia, there was a small country called Lauristan (<H.: Ló-Ur
Isten), 'Land placed under the protection of the Horse-Lordgod' i.e.
Sungod. It was the unique task of the Scythians who lived in that
country to raise horses for the Persian armies. Their popular art was
also overladen with horse representations. — Another example: The
Armenian bishop, Israyel, who travelled into the land of the Huns and
described their beliefs, said this: "The Huns worshipped their highest
divinity in the form of a giant warrior, mounted on horseback" (P 081
p. 65). - The Hungarian AU sound usually changes into 0, as in the
city-name of Iglau, which is in modern Hungarian, Igló.
61. Originally, the eastern border lands of Germany (the future
Austria) were a creation of Frankish rulers. They were re-established
later, as duchies of Carinthia (976), Carniola (1040), Styria (1055)
and Ostmark (1156).
