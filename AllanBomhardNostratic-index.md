FOREWORD
This Nostratic Etymological Index contains all of the Proto-Nostratic roots and their derived verbal and nominal forms cited in the second and third volumes (Part Three: Comparative Vocabulary) of the second revised, corrected, and expanded edition of my book A Comprehensive Introduction to Nostratic Comparative Linguistics (published on-line under a Creative Commons License [2015]). This Index does not include either the supporting data from the daughter languages or the references. The supporting data can be found in Volumes 2 and 3 of the above book, while the references can be found in Volume 4. In comparing the lexical material from the various Nostratic daughter languages, I have tried to be very careful about the issue of semantic plausibility. Where there is either a one-to-one or an extremely close semantic correspondence, there is, of course, no problem. Unfortunately, things are not always this straightforward. Quite often, there is not a one-to-one semantic correspondence in such cases, we must be able to derive the proposed cognates from the postulated ancestor form by widely-attested semantic shifts and not by mere speculation. Therefore, in attempting to determine whether or not particular lexical items from the various language families under consideration might be related, I have made extensive use of Carl Darling Buck’s A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages (1949) as a control for the semantic development of the proposed lexical parallels, and references to the appropriate sections of this work are given at the end of each proposed Nostratic etymology in my book. It may be noted that, in examining the lexicons of Kartvelian, Afrasian, UralicYukaghir, Elamo-Dravidian, Altaic, and Eskimo-Aleut, semantic shifts similar to those described by Buck for the Indo-European languages are found over and over again in these other language families as well. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that, in order to gain a complete understanding of how I arrived at my proposals, Buck’s dictionary must be consulted. However, in a number of instances, where I felt it was warranted due to the wide semantic differences found among the forms cited from the daughter languages, I have given brief explanations within the etymologies themselves. As valuable as Buck’s dictionary is, however, it is not without its shortcomings. In the first place, as noted by Buck himself, the dictionary is not complete — due to the nature of the material involved, Buck and his assistants had to be selective in choosing what to include. Next, the research upon which the dictionary is based is now well over half a century old. Therefore, Buck’s dictionary must be supplemented by more recent scholarship. Unfortunately, however, this work is spread throughout so many journal articles, dissertations, and books that it is virtually impossible to consult all of it, especially when one is dealing with multiple language families. It is not enough, moreover, simply to compare dictionary forms. Rather, when working with the lexical data from the various Nostratic daughter languages, one

must strive to ascertain the underlying semantics, that is to say, the fundamental meaning or meanings from which the full set of semantic nuances are derived, based upon actual usage, wherever this is possible, and one must be cognizant of the interrelationship between social, cultural, and conceptual factors on the one hand and semantic structures on the other. It goes without saying that this is neither a simple nor an easy undertaking. The approach that I have followed thus leads to the establishment of what may be called “families of words” in the tradition of the great Indo-European comparative dictionaries by Julius Pokorny (1959) and Alois Walde (1927—1932). The starting point is always the reconstructed Nostratic forms. The material cited from the individual Nostratic daughter languages is then to be judged primarily by whether or not it can be convincingly derived from the antecedent Nostratic forms either directly or through widely-attested semantic shifts. The difficulties involved in dealing with semantic change in unattested languages have been clearly articulated by Werner Winter:
The difficulties encountered by the etymologist reaching out toward unattested
and hence textless languages are deep-rooted and virtually insurmountable.
When one reads an intelligently written, richly documented book such as Blank
1997, one cannot help being impressed with the fact that it is relatively easy to
describe and classify semantic changes such as metonymy and metaphor that
occurred in the course of the history of an individual language or a group of
closely related languages, but that there is a near total absence of what one
might call determinacy and hence predictability as to the kind and direction of
the changes that can be shown to have taken place and therefore can be
expected to occur again under comparable circumstances. The applicability of
a form may remain unchanged, it may be extended to cover additional meaning
configurations, it may be narrowed, it may be eliminated altogether; new
denotations added may concern closely related items, as in the case of
metonymy, or seemingly very different ones, as when metaphors are used. As
long as one limits oneself to a retrospective analysis of data from historically
well-attested languages, the lack of regularity will not affect the descriptive
adequacy of one’s findings; if, however, one turns to the study of prehistoric
stages of a language or a group of languages, one is left with hardly any well
defined criteria by which to evaluate one’s hypotheses (and those of others).
The only criterion that seems to be operationally usable derives from the
assumption made above: if both phonetic and semantic change occurred in
relatively small steps, feature by feature, component by component, then the
likelihood that a hypothesis might be correct can be said to be supported in a
more than subjective way. This does not eliminate the difficulty that observable
change can occur in all possible directions and that to complicate matters even
further, in the course of a historical development, the direction may change at
any time. If that is the case, it follows that in the absence of observable data
that is, under conditions normal for reconstructional linguists — no
objectifiable criteria can be called upon by the etymologist, and his proposals
will always reflect his personal preferences.



FOREWORD iii
Another important point that needs to be reiterated concerns how I segment the reconstructed forms I am dealing with. Comparison of the various Nostratic daughter languages indicates that the rules governing the structural patterning of roots and stems is Proto-Nostratic were most likely as follows:
1. There were no initial vowels in Proto-Nostratic. Therefore, every root began with a consonant. 2. There were no initial consonant clusters either. Consequently, every root began with one and only one consonant. Medial clusters were permitted, however. 3. Two basic root types existed: (A) *CV and (B) *CVC, where C = any nonsyllabic, and V = any vowel. Permissible root forms coincided exactly with these two syllable types. 4. A stem could either be identical with a root or it could consist of a root plus a single derivational morpheme added as a suffix to the root: *CVC+C-. Any consonant could serve as a suffix. Note: In nominal stems, this derivational suffix was added directly to the root: *CVC+C-. In verbal stems, it was added to the root plus formative vowel: *CVC+V+C-. 5. A stem could thus assume any one of the following shapes: (A) *CV-, (B) *CVC-, (C) *CVC+C-, or (D) (reduplicated) *CVC-CVC-. As in Proto-Altaic, the undifferentiated stems were real forms in themselves and could be used without additional suffixes or grammatical endings. However, when so used, a vowel had to be added to the stem: (A) *CV- > *CV (no change), (B) *CVC- > *CVC+V, (C) *CVC+C- > *CVC+C+V, or (D) (reduplicated) *CVC-CVC- > *CVC-CVC+V. Following Afrasian terminology, this vowel may be called a “terminal vowel” (TV). Not only did terminal vowels exist in Proto-Afrasian, they are also found in Dravidian, where they are called “enunciative vowels”, and in Elamite, where they are called “thematic vowels”. In Proto-Dravidian, the enunciative vowel was only required in stems ending in obstruents, which could not occur in final position.
The original root structure patterning was maintained longer in Afrasian, Dravidian, and Altaic than in the other branches, while the patterning found in Proto-IndoEuropean and Proto-Kartvelian has been modified by developments specific to each of these branches. The root structure constraints found in Proto-Indo-European were an innovation. In Proto-Uralic, the rule requiring that all words end in a vowel was an innovation and arose from the incorporation of the so-called “terminal vowel” into the stem. It should be mentioned here that reduplication was a widespread phenomenon. On the basis of the evidence of Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian, ProtoAfrasian, Proto-Dravidian, and Proto-Altaic, it may be assumed that there were three fundamental stem types: (A) verbal stems, (B) nominal and adjectival stems, and (C) pronominal and indeclinable stems. Some stems were exclusively nominal. In the majority of cases, however, both verbal stems and nominal stems could be built from the same root. In Proto-Nostratic, only pronominal and indeclinable



iv NOSTRATIC ETYMOLOGICAL INDEX
stems could end in a vowel. Verbal and nominal stems, on the other hand, had to end in a consonant, though, as noted above, when the undifferentiated stems were used as real words in themselves, a “terminal vowel” had to be added to the stem. As explained in Chapter 17 of my book, the terminal vowels were morphologically significant (as were the “formative vowels”). Etymological (where they exist) and non-etymological dictionaries for individual languages have also been heavily consulted, as have journal articles and papers beyond count — a complete list can be found in the references in Volume 4 of my forthcoming book. Proto-Nostratic verbs are cited in their root/stem form, nouns in the “status indeterminatus” form (that is, *-a).
Adjectives did not exist as an independent grammatical category in ProtoNostratic. Intransitive verbs could function as “adjectives”. Also, “adjectives” were differentiated from nouns mainly by syntactical means — a noun placed before another noun functioned as an attribute to the latter. In the Nostratic vocabulary that follows, the attributive meaning is indicated by “adj.”

607. Proto-Nostratic 1st singular personal pronoun stem *ʔa- (~ *ʔə-), *ʔi- (~ *ʔe-) ‘I, me’
No doubt originally the same as the deictic particles *ʔa-, *ʔi- listed below.
Note: The Chukchi forms support the view that we are dealing with what was originally a deictic particle here inasmuch as the same patterning is found in both the first and second person predicative pronoun stems. Moreover, it is the proximate deictic form *ʔi- (~ *ʔe-) that is represented in ChukchiKamchatkan as opposed to the distant form *ʔa- (~ *ʔə-) found in Afrasian (the Proto-Indo-European forms *ʔe+k’-, *ʔe+go-, and *ʔe+ko- are phonologically ambiguous). This seems to indicate that independent developments were involved in each branch, using the same basic elements.
608. Proto-Nostratic demonstrative stems (originally deictic particles): Proximate: *ʔi- (~ *ʔe-) ‘this’; Intermediate: *ʔu- (~ *ʔo-) ‘that’; Distant: *ʔa- (~ *ʔə-) ‘that yonder, that over there’
Note: These stems often combined with other deictic particles: *ʔa/i/u+na-, *ʔa/i/u+ša-,*ʔa/i/u+ma-,*ʔa/i/u+toa-, *ʔa/i/u+koa-, *ʔa/i/u+ya-, etc.

Semantics as in Sanskrit punā́ ti ‘to make clean, clear, pure, or bright; to cleanse, to purify, to purge, to clarify; (with sáktum) to cleanse from chaff, to winnow; to sift, to discriminate, to discern’, (passive) pūyáte ‘to be cleaned, washed, or purified’; related to Old High German fowen ‘to sift, to clean grain’ and Latin pūrus ‘clean, pure’.

628. Proto-Nostratic root *ʔan ̈- (~ *ʔən ̈-): (vb.) *ʔan ̈- ‘to draw near to, to approach, to come (close to)’; (n.) *ʔan ̈-a ‘nearness, proximity’ Derivative: (particle) *ʔan ̈-‘to, towards, over, for, against, upon, on’

Note: The CVC- patterning shows that this stem could not originally have been a particle, though this is how it is preserved in the daughter languages. Though the original meaning is unknown, we may speculate that it may have been something like ‘(vb.) to be more, over, above, extra; (n.) that which is more, over, above, extra; (adj.) many, more, extra, additional, numerous, teeming’.
635. Proto-Nostratic root *ʔar- (~ *ʔər-): (vb.) *ʔar- ‘to cut (off, apart), to sever, to separate, to part asunder’; (n.) *ʔar-a ‘half, side, part’; (adj.) ‘severed, separated, parted, disjoined’

Note: Semantic shifts took place in Semitic, Indo-European, and, in part, Altaic; the original meaning was preserved in Egyptian and Turkic.
669. Proto-Nostratic root *ʔor-: (vb.) *ʔor- ‘to move rapidly, quickly, hastily; to set in motion’; (n.) *ʔor-a ‘any rapid motion: running, flowing, pouring, etc.’; (adj.) ‘rapid, quick, hasty’

673. Proto-Nostratic root *ʔow-: Extended form: (vb.) *ʔow-V-ħ- ‘to hatch eggs’; (n.)*ʔow-ħ-a ‘egg’
Dolgopolsky has proposed a very attractive etymology here. However, it must be noted that Arabic "āḥ ‘eggwhite, albumen’ is isolated within Semitic. Moreover, even though the Proto-Indo-European form is traditionally reconstructed as *ō ̯u ̯iom ‘egg’, no single reconstruction can account for all of the forms found in the Indo-European daughter languages. Accordingly, there



110 NOSTRATIC ETYMOLOGICAL INDEX
are difficulties with this etymology. If this is a valid etymology, it would imply that the Proto-Indo-European form is to be reconstructed as *TMo ̯uš ̯iom ‘egg’,
with short vowel in the first syllable and a laryngeal (*š [= * ̧]) between * ̯u
and * ̯i (the long vowel found in the first syllable of the forms attested in several of the Indo-European daughter languages would then be due to compensatory lengthening following the loss of this laryngeal). There may have been a nonapophonic *o (original, or inherited, *o) in the first syllable, in which case the Proto-Nostratic form would have been *ʔow-ħ-. Reconstructing a medial laryngeal (*š [= * ̧]) would also account for the Germanic developments.
*ʔow ̧-yo-m (traditional *TMo ̯uš ̯iom) ‘egg’ cannot, as is often assumed, be a
derivative of the common Proto-Indo-European word for ‘bird’, which requires an initial a-coloring laryngeal (preserved in Armenian): *Aéw-i-s [*Aáw-i-s], *Aw-éy-s > Armenian hav ‘bird, hen, chicken’; Latin avis ‘a bird’; Umbrian (acc.) avif ‘bird’; Sanskrit (nom. sg.) ví-ḥ, (Rigveda) vé-ḥ ‘a bird’; etc.
674. Proto-Nostratic root *ʔoy-: (vb.) *ʔoy- ‘to be by oneself, to be alone’; (n.) *ʔoy-a ‘solitude, aloneness’; (adj.) ‘single, alone; one’
675. Proto-Nostratic (n.) *ʔul-a ‘the bottom or lowest part of anything; the sole of the foot; soil, earth, ground, land’
Semantics as in Latin sŏlum ‘the bottom or lowest part of anything; the sole of the foot; soil, earth, ground, land’ (cf. Buck 1949:1.212).
676. Proto-Nostratic deictic stem indicating distance farthest away from the speaker *ʔul- (~ *ʔol-) ‘that over there, that yonder’
