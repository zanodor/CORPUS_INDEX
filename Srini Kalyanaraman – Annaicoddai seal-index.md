Annaicoddai seal.The two graffiti symbols signify metalcasting smithy
Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions mixed in with Megalithic Graffiti Symbols found in Annaikottai, Sri Lanka.
The two duplicated graffiti symbols resemble and may be variants of Sign 162 of Indus Script.
This sign 162 is read in Meluhha rebus as: kolmo 'rice-plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' PLUS dula 'duplicated' rebus: dul 'metalcasting'. Thus, metalcasting smithy.
Annaicoddai Seal is a steatite seal that was found in Annaicoddai, Sri Lanka during archeological excavations of a megalithic burial site by a team of researchers from the Jaffna University. The seal contains some of the oldest inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi mixed with Megalithic Graffiti symbols found on the island and is dated to early 3rd or late 4th century BC. Although many pottery fragments have been found in excavations throughout Sri Lanka and Southern India that had both varieties of Brahmi and Megalithic Graffiti Symbols side by side, Annaicoddai seal is distinguished by having each written in a manner that indicates that the Megalithic Graffiti Symbols may be a translation of the Brahmi characters. Read from right to left, the legend is read as ‘Koveta’ (Ko-vet-a). Linguists read it as in South Dravidian or early Tamil indicating a chieftain or king. Similar inscriptions have been found throughout ancient Tamilakam, in modern day South India. (Indrapala, Karthigesu (2007).

Early settlements in Jaffna, an archaeological surveyMadras: Raghupathy, pp. 199-204). Investigators disagree on whether Megalithic Graffiti Symbols found in South India and Sri Lanka constitute an ancient writing system that preceded the introduction and widespread acceptance of Brahmi variant scripts or non lithic symbols. The purpose of usage remains unclear.
