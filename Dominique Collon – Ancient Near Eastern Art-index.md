This survey of Ancient Near Eastern Art is based on the collections of the
British Museum, and I should like to thank John Curtis, Keeper of the
Department of Western Asiatic yXntiquities, for asking me to write it. I am
most grateful to my colleagues in the Department for their support and
helpful comments. Any errors are, according to the time-honoured phrase,
my own. Eva Wilson kindly allowed me to use her drawings of a seal in
Chapter 3 and Annie Searight drew the maps and two of the figures in
Chapter 4. Hero Granger-Taylor supplied me with information on Sasanian
textiles discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. Christopher Walker produced the
Mesopotamian Chronology. Unless otherwise stated in the captions, all
objects illustrated are in the British Museum. Barbara Winter and John
Heffron took many photographs specially for this book, and colleagues in
the Oriental Institute in Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and the Louvre in Paris helped
me to obtain photographs of objects in their collections. Celia Clear and
Nina Shandloff of British Museum Press read an early draft, but the onus of
editing and seeing this volume through to publication has rested on Teresa
Francis, who has coped with my exigencies with efficiency, patience and
humour. To all I extend my heartfelt thanks.



Introduction
T
he Ancient Near East is here understood as consisting of pre-Islamic
Turkey east of the Bosphorus, the Caucasus, Syria, Lebanon, Israel,
Palestine, Jordan, Iraq, Iran eastwards into Central Asia, and the Arabian
peninsula. A large part of this area is linked by two great rivers, the Tigris
1 and the Euphrates. Both have their sources in eastern Turkey. The
Euphrates flows westwards and then south into Syria, and south-eastwards
through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris just before entering the Gulf. In
Syria it has several left-bank tributaries, of which the most important is the
Khabur; these originate in the mountains which form the frontier between
Turkey and Syria, and they irrigate a rich area which has always been
extensively settled. Most of the course of the Tigris is also south-eastwards,
i Assyrians offer sacrifices, while scribes and sculptors carve inscriptions and a relief of the king (still visible today) in the caves (note the stalagmites) al the source of the Tigris south of Lake Van in eastern Turkey.

from Turkey into Iraq, where it eventually joins the Euphrates and enters
the Gulf. It, too, has important left-bank tributaries, but these flow south
westwards from the Zagros mountains which form the natural barrier
between Iraq and Iran; the most important, from north to south, are the
Greater and Lesser Zab, the Diyala, the Karkheh and the Karun, all of
which provide routes into Iran.
The land between the Tigris and the Euphrates is often called Meso
potamia, a Greek word meaning ‘between the rivers’. In the south was the
land of Sumer, where one of the great civilisations of antiquity originated.
Here, where the two rivers unite near modern Basra, was the traditional
location of the biblical Garden of Eden (EDEN is a Sumerian word meaning
steppe). Further north was the land of Akkad which, between about 2330
and 2190 bc, under a brilliant dynasty, produced magnificent objects which
reflect its imperial ambitions. Later, Sumer and Akkad were united under
Babylonian rule. Whenever Mesopotamia has been united, its capital cities
- Akkad, Babylon, Seleucia, Ctesiphon, Samarra and finally Baghdad - 154
have stood at or near the point where the two rivers flow closest to each
other. The so-called Assyrian Triangle, centred on the Tigris north of the
Lesser Zab, was the land of Assyria which, from lime to time, and most
dramatically in the first centuries of the first millennium BC, extended its
rule to other areas of the Near East.
Sumer, Akkad/Babylonia and Assyria were linked to each other and to
Syria and Turkey by the Tigris and Euphrates, which were major trade
routes. Another main trade route ran south of the foothills of northern Iraq
and Syria and carried goods, luxuries and ideas to and from the Mediterra
nean on the one hand, and Iran and even Central Asia on the other. Here
were the cities of Carchemish and Aleppo. Further to the south-east, the
Syrian Desert formed an effective barrier which was only overcome to a
limited extent when the domestication of the camel in the early second
millennium BC led to the development of caravan trade and the eventual rise
to importance of cities such as Tadmor (Palmyra) and Hatra. In the south, 164,158
the Syrian and Arabian Deserts merge. The early settlements and caravan
cities of the Arabian peninsula could never have supported a large popula
tion, and throughout the millennia nomads have moved from their oases
into the fertile land to the east and west of the Syrian Desert and revitalised
the old, sedentary civilisations.
To the west of the Syrian Desert a road south still links a string of major
cities situated at points where there are passes through the mountains to the
Mediterranean coast: from Aleppo in the north travellers can reach the coast
either at al-Mina via ancient Alalakh and Antioch, or at Ugarit; Hama is 2
astride the road to Tartous and the island city of Arvad; Homs, at the
western end of the caravan route across the Syrian Desert from Palmyra,
guards the Homs Gap where Qadesh once stood, and the Crusader castle of
10



the Crak des Chevaliers still broods over the way to the Lebanese coast,
Tripoli and Byblos; Damascus, surrounded by its orchards, lies on the road
to Beirut; Megiddo and Beth-Shan guarded the biblical ‘Way of the Sea’
which led from the River Jordan, through the Jezreel Valley and the fertile
Plain of Esdraelon, to the coast near medieval Acre and modern Haifa; and
Amman is at one end of a route leading across the River Jordan, past
6 Jericho, up to Jerusalem and on to the coast at Joppa (now Jaffa, part of Tel
Aviv).
Parallel and to the west is another north-south route along a geological
fault which is the extension northwards-of the African Great Rift Valley.
5 Along it are the Ghab in Syria with the River Orontes flowing through it, the
Bekaa in the Lebanon, the Sea of Galilee, the River Jordan, the deep
depression formed by the Dead Sea, the Wadi Araba and the Red Sea.
Mountain ranges create an almost unbroken barrier between this fault and a
narrow coastal strip along the east Mediterranean coast.
Because they were hemmed in by the mountains, the people who lived
along this coast - the Canaanites and later, in the first millennium BC, the
Phoenicians in the north and the Philistines in the south - had to look
westwards across the Mediterranean for their livelihood. Thev made use of
the fine natural harbours: al-Mina at the mouth of the River Orontes; Minet
el-Beida, the harbour of ancient Ugarit (now Ras Shamra) near its modern

equivalent Latakiyeh; Arvad, Byblos, Sidon, Tyre, Acco, Dor, Joppa and
Ashkelon. Goods from the east reached them through the passes from the
great cities of inland Syria and were traded for wares from Egypt, Cyprus,
Crete, Greece and beyond. The name Palestine, which derived from
Philistine, was used until recently for the whole area south of Syria, and in
the present book it will be used in this broader sense. The Phoenicians
established harbours and trading centres wherever the Greeks, and later the
Romans, were unable to stop them, predominantly along the north coast of
Africa, in southern Spain and along the Atlantic seaboard on both sides of
the Straits of Gibraltar. The centre of these Punic colonies was Carthage,
near modern Tunis, and the Punic state soon became independent of its
Phoenician origins and rose to dominate trade in the west Mediterranean
basin. It came into conflict with the Roman Republic, and the Punic wars,
fought under such generals as Hannibal, culminated in the destruction of
Carthage in 146 bc.
Turkey is a land bridge between east and west, north and south, and
throughout its history peoples such as the Hittites, Lydians, Lycians,
perhaps the Carians, the Phrygians, lonians and Aeolians, and more
recently the Seljuk and Ottoman Turks, have moved into the country,
settled and been assimilated by those already there, or have passed through
to some other area of Europe, the Near East or beyond. Frequently referred
to as Anatolia (from the Greek, meaning ‘east’), Turkey consists of a high
central plateau embraced by two huge ranges of mountains, the best known
ofwhich are the Taurus mountains in the south. These ranges come together
in the west, where they are cut by rivers such as the Meander, and extend
like fingers out to sea to form the Aegean islands. In eastern Turkey the
mountains are gradually being compressed by the tilting of the Arabian
peninsula, and the area is subject to earthquakes. The highest mountain,
Mount Ararat, lies on the border between Turkey, Iran and the Republic of
Armenia; its name is derived from that of the Kingdom of Urartu, which
flourished here from the ninth to the seventh century bc, with its capital on
Lake Van, and controlled the vast mineral resources of the area. To the 131
north-east, the rich tombs on either side of the Caucasus mountains provide
a tantalising glimpse of the cultures which flourished in these areas. South of
the Anatolian plateau, major passes cut through the mountains to the coast,
the most famous being the strategic Cilician Gates through the Taurus
mountains to the rich plains of Cilicia along the Mediterranean.
Finally, to the east lies Iran, also known as Persia. Here, a huge central
desert is surrounded on the north, west and south by mountains which are
equally rich in mineral resources. To the north-east and east there is no clear
natural boundary between Iran, Central Asia and the areas now known as
Pakistan and Afghanistan. Lapis lazuli from the mountains of Badakhshan
in Afghanistan (and later perhaps tin) was the principal item of trade which
12



Introduction
passed through Iran to the countries of the Near East and to Egypt. In south
central Iran a local source of chlorite, a soft green stone, was exploited by the
inhabitants of Tepe Yahya, and vessels made from it were traded as far afield
as Syria. Bronze-working was a major activity in Luristan in the west. Here,
in remote mountain valleys, communities developed their own individual
cultures, but it has been suggested that nomads formed a link between them
and carried objects made by them southwards to the markets of Elam
around Susa. Geographically this latter area, now known as Khuzistan, is an
eastward extension of the south Mesopotamian plain, but politically it has
always been separate and this tension has led to conflicts between the two
areas from time immemorial, culminating most recently in the Iraq-Iran
war. The cultural life of the two areas has always reflected this political
tension, and Elam shifted its location accordingly, at times controlling an
area round a more eastern capital at Anshan (Tall-i Malyan), and at others
centred on Susa, which was closer to Mesopotamia. Later, after the arrival of
143 the Indo-Aryan Persians, Susa remained the capital and Persepolis replaced
Anshan as the royal city of the Achaemenid Persians.
The climate of the huge area covered by the term Near East is as varied as
its geography. What has frequently been referred to as the Fertile Crescent
extends in a huge arc south of the mountains forming the natural border
between Turkey and Syria, and then curves round along the Zagros
mountains which form a similar natural boundary between Iraq and Iran. In
this region, which not only has sufficient rainfall but is well watered by the
rivers flowing from the mountains, there is abundant vegetation, game and
fish. Many of the wild species of both animals and plants which were first
domesticated by man occur naturally in this area, and here some of the
earliest farming communities developed. It used to be thought that this was
the so-called ‘cradle of civilisation’, but it now appears that similarly
favourable conditions existed in many other regions, for instance in an area
of caves near Mount Carmel on the borders between Israel and the Lebanon;
around Damascus and even further out towards the Syrian Desert; in central
and south-eastern Turkey; and in the valleys of western Iran. Numerous
other places are constantly being added to the list as surveys and excavations
increase our knowledge.
These rural communities may have been responsible for what is some
times referred to as the ‘Neolithic’ or ‘Agricultural Revolution’, but al
though they produced interesting painted pottery, figurines and sometimes
wall-paintings, something more was necessary to create a civilisation. The
right conditions for this emerged in the land of Sumer, in the southern
reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Here there was an area of
3 marshes where wild boar and fish abounded and date-palms grew, and
where a specialised way of life developed which has remained virtually
unchanged over the millennia. Beyond, however, the country is arid, and in
13



3 1’he mudhif reed huts of the marshes of southern Iraq have not changed over the millennia (see Figs 33 and 37). They are made of bundles of reeds used both as uprights and bent over to form the ribs of an arched roof, which is then covered with reed matting. The walls are made of reed trellises through which the light can filter and air can circulate. The patterns created by the criss-crossing lines of the trellis may have inspired early pottery designs in the region (the so-called Eridu and Hajji Mohammed styles).
order to grow plants and feed their cattle and flocks the inhabitants have to
divert the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates into a network ofcanals and
irrigation ditches. Irrigation agriculture can only be practised successfully if
there is co-operation on a large scale between those building, administering
and benefiting from the canals. A similar degree of co-operation was needed
for the development of agriculture in the Nile Valley in Egypt, the Indus
Valley on the borders of Pakistan and India, and the Yellow River in China,
and it is no coincidence that all developed early, successful and individual
civilisations, accompanied by the elaboration of recording systems and
writing (see Chapter i).
The production of surplus crops, by-products and manufactured goods
meant that exchange was possible and this enabled the Sumerians, or their
predecessors in the area, to obtain materials which were lacking in their
country, such as wood of better quality than the fibrous date-palm, oil,
stones and metals. This long-distance trade brought other regions into
contact with Sumer, and ideas as well as goods travelled along the waterways
and tracks of the Near East. By the fourth millennium BC distinctive
cultures were developing in Sumer, south-western Iran and Egypt, and
these cultures were in touch with one another. The civilisation developed in
Sumer spread up the river valleys and their tributaries into Syria and
Turkey, and in each area, under this impetus, further cultures evolved,
combining the new ideas with what had been elaborated locally over the
millennia.
The increase in wealth led to the development of a hierarchy able to make
use of it. At first the economy seems to have been controlled by the temples
of the local deities and their priests, but increasingly, during the third
14



Introduction
millennium BC, wealth came to be concentrated in the hands of secular
powers. In order to enhance the importance of their temples or palaces,
priests and rulers stimulated the creation of beautiful objects made of rich
materials, often imported over great distances.
The objects produced in this way are not always what we now understand
as art. But art is so often a question of personal taste, and what is beautiful to
one person or within one culture may not be so to another person or in
another context. The taste and financial resources of the person who
commissions a work of art are, and always have been, key factors (see page
187 and Fig. 147). The amount of time and technical expertise expended on
an artefact have also always been taken into account in assessing its worth.
Many of the objects which we consider to be works of art may not have been
valued in the same way by the people who created them, because they saw
them in the context of a whole culture, while for us only the tip of the iceberg
remains.
What has survived from the cultures of the Ancient Near East is to a large
extent due to the strange configuration of ancient sites in the region. Until
the recent advent of concrete, and even perhaps since, the main building
4 material has been mud brick. The raw materials for this - mud and straw for
bonding - are ubiquitous. In areas where stone was available, mud-brick
4 Mud-brick houses at Tell Mahli north of Hama in Syria in 1967. The beehive construction is a wood-saving device already known, it seems, at Arpachiyah in northern Iraq in the 5th millennium BC. Note the new concrete building in the background.



Ancient Near Eastern Art
walls were often built on stone foundations or were faced with stone slabs
which could be carved with reliefs. Where fuel was available in sufficient
quantities, the mud brick could be baked, but baked brick was normally
reserved for weather-proofing major buildings, and then only for the outer
skin of bricks. In earthquake areas half-timber constructions were common
because they gave buildings the necessary elasticity; however, in the event
of a fire accompanying the earthquake, such buildings have been shown to
be extremely vulnerable. Usually, because suitable wood for roofs, door
and window-frames was generally at a premium, when a building was
abandoned the wood would be removed and reused. The mud-brick
building would be demolished and the site levelled to provide a platform for
the new building. These platforms, therefore, contain the foundations and
ground-plans of earlier buildings. As the process repeats itself, so a mound
is formed, incorporating a series of superimposed platforms and building
remains.
Thus, over the years, the mounds grow, and they are found all over the
Near East, extending into Egypt and the Balkans. The secret of a mound’s
rapid growth lies in the use of perishable materials. To a lesser extent, the
same process can be traced in the older European cities, where Roman and
medieval levels lie below the surface of modern roads, and steps often lead
down into old churches and cathedrals where once they led up to them.
However, because in these cities baked brick or stone, both reusable, have
been the main building materials, the rate of growth is much slower and the
characteristic mound is not perceptible.
The Near Eastern mound is a feature of the landscape; in Arabic it is
referred to as tell, and in Turkish as huyiik, hoyi'ik or tepe, and one of these
terms appended or prefixed to a place-name means that somewhere in the
vicinity there is an ancient site. Settlements have generally been centred on
strategic cross-roads, near fords or ferries across rivers, or near the sources
of raw materials. A good water supply has always been an essential
prerequisite and, because the presence of water meant the possibility of
__
flooding, a natural elevation would, if possible, be selected for the original
settlement; as a result, many ancient mounds are in part natural. As a
mound increased in height, so the climb up and down to the water-source
became steeper and the area at the top of the mound became smaller.
Buildings would be terraced into the sides of the mound, but eventually
most of the new houses would be built around its foot, and the old town,
sometimes walled, sometimes including the palace or temple of the city,
would survive in a fossilised state at the top. Erbil, in northern Iraq, is a
huge mound topped by a citadel and an old city, while the new city and
market stretch at its feet.
Qalaat el Moudiq, in Syria, is another example. The mound was built on a 5
natural limestone outcrop dominating a ravine which provided access from
16



the Ghab depression and the River Orontes onto the plateau north-west of
Hama. Excavation into the slopes of the mound has revealed occupation
from at least as early as the fifth millennium bc and Palaeolithic flints
indicate some activity around the site at a much earlier date. Later the
mound served as the acropolis of the Hellenistic and Roman city of Apamea,
the ruins of which cover the hills on the opposite side of the ravine. The
Ghab had probably already become a malarial marsh during the second
millennium bc, but earthquakes, the advent of Islam and the subsequent
break in trade with the west from the seventh century ad onwards led to the
abandonment of Apamea and only the acropolis was still inhabited. When
the Abbasid caliphs were building their capital at Samarra north of Baghdad
in the ninth century ad, they obtained some of their building materials and
columns from Apamea, 500 miles across the Syrian Desert. The fortifica
tions built by the Crusaders are still visible on the top of the mound. In the
sixteenth century a charming little mosque was built into the slopes of the
mound and an Ottoman caravanserai - now a museum of Roman mosaics
was built in the valley. The modern village still huddles within the Crusader
ramparts but is expanding along the track up the ravine. Drainage of the
Ghab is leading to repopulation of the valley.
Changes in water supply or in a road or canal system can lead to the
abandonment of a site, and the process of erosion means that the upper
5 Qalaat el Moudiq in Syria, rhe mound is on the right, crowned by the later fortifications built by the Crusaders (the large number of fair-haired children are reputed to be their descendants). The ravine leads down to the Ghab depression, where a modern canal is visible in the distance. The arch on the left was part of the Roman theatre, and the minaret of the mosque appears just above the donkey.

levels are gradually washed down the slopes of the mound. In some cases a
river will change its course and part of the mound may be washed away. Or a
mound may be buried in alluvial deposits; this has happened to many sites
in southern Iraq and some have only been rediscovered during the cutting of
an irrigation channel or a new road.
When an archaeologist selects a site for excavation, the task, in the Near
East, is made easier for him (or her) because the presence of the mounds
indicates the location of habitation sites. However, these need not neces
sarily be very ancient, and in order to choose one of the period he wishes to
investigate, he must carry out a survey in the area of his choice. The clues to
the dates of the sites lie all over the mounds and around them in the form of
sherds of broken pottery. Pottery, which was first made around 6000 bc, is
one of the most enduring of all artefacts and is an extremely good indicator of
date - we only have to think of the way fashions in china and in the types of
dishes we use in our kitchens have changed over the last few decades to see
that this is so. And because pots break and are thrown away, the archaeolo
gist has to look for sherds showing the shape or decoration which are typical
of the period in which he is interested.
Pottery sequences have been established for most areas of the Near East
and provide relative dates. Certain items, such as oil and wine, were traded
in pottery containers and these have allowed links to be made between
individual pottery sequences. Sometimes approximate dates can be pro
vided through scientific methods such as thermoluminescence (which
indicates when a pot was fired), radioactive Carbon 14 (for organic matter),
or dendrochronology (tree-ring dating of wood). In some areas, or at some
periods, absolute dates have been established by texts (see page 24 below)
recording astronomical observations or sequences of kings, thus providing
fixed points within relative chronologies.
The sherds on the top of a mound will be those from the pottery in use
immediately prior to its abandonment. Sometimes the sherds at the mouth
of an animal’s burrow will give some indication of the types of pottery
hidden in the heart of the mound. Where an extensive settlement is
succeeded by a smaller one, evidence of the larger settlement will survive on
parts of the surface and the mound will have an irregular shape. The
excavation of a composite mound is difficult because the latest levels at the
top of the parent mound will be earlier than, or contemporary with, the
settlement at its foot, and the houses terraced into the sides of a mound will
be later than other houses at the same level but within the parent mound. It
is therefore necessary to keep a close check of which walls cut into which. In
the last centuries bc there was a widespread habit of digging deep grain
silos, later used as rubbish pits, and the outlines of these have to be carefully
plotted since the contents of the pits will be later - and sometimes very
considerably later - than the levels into which the pits have been sunk.

Introduction
Graves present a similar problem, but the habit of digging cemeteries into
the tops of abandoned mounds persists to this day and often causes
difficulties for the would-be excavator who suddenly finds he has a whole
community up in arms. In the 1870s Hormuzd Rassam had to excavate the
mound of Balawat in northern Iraq through a series of tunnels in order to
avoid disturbing the graves on the surface, and in the 1950s Max Mallowan
was confronted with the same problem, which he thought he had solved by
paying the inhabitants of the modern village of Balawat a sum in compensa
tion, only to discover that the mound served as a cemetery for several
different villages. Sometimes the excavator will cut a step trench into the
side of a mound in order to establish the whole sequence of occupation. If
part of the mound has been washed away by a river, then the section through
the mound, once cleaned up, can serve the same purpose. This sequence of
layers is known as the stratification of the mound.
The history of the exploration of the ancient sites of the Near East is tied to
religion, politics and economics as well as to the growth of interest in
antiquarian matters in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
ad. Religion has been responsible for interest in the Holy Land throughout
the last two thousand years. Pilgrims, and later Crusaders, brought back
relics, although the majority of these were of very doubtful authenticity.
179 However, many of them were wrapped in pieces of old silk of Sasanian date
(c. ad 224-651) and woven with intricate designs incorporating animals and
mythical creatures (see also Chapter 6). One Crusader brought back a small
stone from the site of the Crucifixion in Jerusalem and donated it to the
Cappella Palatina in Palermo, where it was enclosed in a casket and only
rediscovered in 1981: it turned out to be a cylinder seal of about 2300 bc
from southern Mesopotamia (now Iraq). The merchants of Venice also
returned with treasures from their forays into the Near East, which included
the sack of Constantinople in 1203 during the Fourth Crusade; Sasanian
vessels and jewels were given Byzantine settings and are now to be found in
the Treasury of St Mark’s. During the nineteenth century, missions were set
up in the Holy Land and interest in the Bible led to research in antiquities
relating to the Old and New Testaments. Too often, however, excavations
were - and sometimes still are - undertaken to kprove’ the Bible right,
leading to selective interpretation of the finds.
Travellers in the nineteenth century showed considerable interest in the
topography of the Holy Land and attempted to locate the sites mentioned in
the Bible. In 1864-5 Captain Charles Wilson carried out the first accurate
survey of Jerusalem. The interest this work aroused led to the establishment
of the Palestine Exploration Fund, under whose auspices further surveys in
Sinai and Palestine were undertaken, notably by a team led by Lieutenant
Charles Warren who mapped the Temple area in Jerusalem (1866-8), often
by means of tunnels and at great personal risk. Some antiquities were

acquired during these activities but generally their date remained to be
established. In 1890 the Fund selected William Flinders Petrie to direct its
first excavations at Tell el-Hesi near Gaza. Petrie was able to establish a
pottery sequence for the mound, covering three millennia from the Early
Bronze Age to Greek times; absolute dates were provided by finds of closely
datable Egyptian objects. His work was continued by Daniel Bliss, who
used a grid system to plan the site and then went on to work in Jerusalem
and, together with R. A. S. Macalister, at a number of other sites which
were published by the Fund. Between 1902 and 1909, Macalister excavated
and published the finds from biblical Gezer, but his incomplete grasp of the
stratification led to confusion in his attribution of the finds to particular
levels. The lack of written documents in Palestine meant that a terminology
was needed to divide the finds chronologically. Macalister used the terms
Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age; his successor for the Fund, Duncan
Mackenzie, working at biblical Beth Shemesh, refined the terminology, and
it has since undergone many further changes and interpretations.
After the First World War, work resumed in the Holy Land. Between
1926 and 1934 Petrie excavated at Tell Jemmeh, Tell Fara South and Tell el
Ajjul and built up a substantial body of information which he published
with exemplary speed. The famous biblical site of Jericho, which had 6
previously been investigated only briefly, was excavated by Professor John
Garstang (1930-6) and Kathleen Kenyon (1950-8). These excavations
20



Introduction
20 revealed substantial remains dating back to around 7000 bc, and a par
ticularly important sequence of Middle Bronze Age tombs from the early
centuries of the second millennium bc (see pages 41 and 97).
The excavations of the site of Lachish between 1932 and 1938 (when the
director of the excavations, J. L. Starkey, was murdered by bandits) were
sponsored by Sir Henry Wellcome and Sir Charles Marston, whose share of
the finds has recently been acquired by the British Museum. These finds
have a particular significance because one of the Museum’s treasures is a
series of Assyrian reliefs from Sennacherib’s South-West Palace.at Nineveh,
7,117 depicting that king’s capture of Lachish in 701 bc.
It is important to stress that the British Museum’s collections of material
from the Holy Land come to a large extent from excavated sites. A firm
foundation for the reconstruction of biblical history can only be obtained
through meticulous excavation; the Museum has therefore contributed to
this work and now houses a useful collection of well-stratified and proven
anced material from most of the sites mentioned above, acquired on the
basis of its scientific importance rather than artistic merit. This policy has
continued with the recent excavations by Jonathan Tubb at Tiwal esh
104 Sharqi and Tell es-Sa’idiyeh in Jordan.
Politics and economics were the impetus for interest in other areas of the
Near East. The Portuguese had opened up trade with the Far East, and the
British, French and Dutch were determined to break this monopoly. The
East India Company was founded in 1600 and the British began acquiring
huge territories in India. Then the Russian Tsar Peter the Great (1682
1725) had the ambition to provide his country with a port on the Black Sea
and access to the Mediterranean through the Bosphorus. To counter this
threat to the balance of power, contacts with the Ottoman Turks were

intensified and missions were sent to the Shah of Persia. Later, in response
to the Russian threat in Central Asia, the British established bases in
Afghanistan and along the north-west frontier of India.
In order to reach India by ship, it was necessary either to circumnavigate
Africa, or to sail to Alexandria, travel overland to Suez, and re-embark there
for Bombay. When, in 1798, during the Napoleonic wars, the French
conquest of Egypt made this shorter journey impossible, the British were
forced to find an alternative overland route through the Near East, which
was then part of the Ottoman Empire and ruled by the Turks from
Constantinople. As a preliminary, they opened a Residency in Baghdad and
in 1808 appointed a young man of 21, Claudius James Rich, as Resident.
Rich was a brilliant linguist and extremely able. He travelled extensively
throughout Mesopotamia and kept records of the sites he visited, including
Nineveh. In 1811, and again in 1817, he spent several days examining the
ruins of Babylon, and he published accounts of his findings. The walls and
‘Hanging Gardens’ of Babylon had been one of the ‘Seven Wonders’ of the 8
ancient world but the city was reduced to a group of impressive mounds
along the Euphrates south of Baghdad. In the nineteenth century it became
fashionable for adventurous young men to extend their Grand Tour of
Europe to include parts of the Near East, while others travelled overland to
take up appointments in India. Many of these came to Baghdad, where the
Riches welcomed them and arranged for them to see the sites, which they
duly recorded. Regrettably, Rich died of cholera in Shiraz in 1821. He had,
however, built up a large collection of antiquities, coins and manuscripts
and these were sold to the British Museum by his widow in 1825 for £7,000.
He seems to have been particularly interested in objects (including seals)
inscribed in the cuneiform script and was greatly aided in recording the
inscriptions by his secretary, Carl Bellino. 9
Excavations at Uruk in southern Iraq and at Susa in south-western Iran
have produced evidence for the invention of this script some time between
3500 and 3100 bc. At first it was pictographic (that is, simple line drawings
representing words, incised on damp clay with a sharp instrument). Gradu
ally the drawings were reduced to signs made up of short straight lines
impressed into the clay with a stylus, and as the impression of the stylus
formed a wedge, this system of writing has come to be known as cuneiform,
from the Latin cuneus meaning wedge or nail. Because the system developed
from pictographs, each sign represented a whole word of a language which,
in southern Iraq, can be recognised as Sumerian. Since most Sumerian
words consisted ofone syllable, each sign also came to represent that syllable
in longer words, words which sounded the same but had different meanings
which were less easy to draw, and even similar-sounding words or syllables
in other languages. Soon the signs became highly stylised, and any re
semblance they might still have retained to the original pictograph vanished

when the direction of writing turned through ninety degrees - a phe
nomenon which has also been detected in other scripts.
Because of its versatility, cuneiform was adapted for writing languages
totally unrelated to Sumerian, the principal ones being Akkadian and its
Assyrian, Babylonian and West Semitic dialects, Ugaritic, Hurrian, Hittite,
Urartian, Elamite and Old Persian. Thanks to the survival of vocabulary
lists and dictionaries, it has been possible to decipher most of these
languages.
But the lists and dictionaries would not have survived had they not been
written predominantly on clay. Already used for buildings and for making
pottery, clay was available everywhere. When baked, it is one of the most
long-lasting materials used by man. Many archives have been burned
accidentally over the millennia, but whereas papyrus, leather, parchment,
lead and, more recently, paper, are destroyed, a fire serves to preserve an
archive written on clay by baking it. Egyptian funerary papyri have survived
in the dry conditions which prevail in Egyptian tombs, but the day-to-day
correspondence and records are largely lacking. Not so with cuneiform
texts: ration lists, letters, annals, epic poems, myths, legends, school texts,
maps, mathematical problems, astronomical records, omens and rituals and
many other types of text have survived and have been excavated over the last
couple of centuries. At certain periods, cuneiform writing was used all over
the Near East and even for diplomatic correspondence with Egypt. It has
been said that for no other period are there the same number and variety of
surviving texts as for the three thousand years when cuneiform was the main
writing system. Our own written culture may be more extensive, but how
much of it is likely to survive for up to five thousand years?
The cuneiform script, though devised for writing on clay, was adapted for
carving on stone and first came to be known in the West through copies of
rock-cut inscriptions still visible in the ruins of Persepolis; these copies had
been made by early travellers such as the Italian Pietro della Valle in the
early seventeenth century and the Dane Karsten Niebuhr in the late
eighteenth century. The German philologist Georg Friedrich Grotefend had
already worked on its decipherment when Henry Creswicke Rawlinson
travelled to Iran as part of a military mission to the court ofthe Shah. In 1835
Rawlinson was posted to Kermanshah and over the next twelve years he
undertook the copying of a long inscription 120 metres up, on a mountain
side at Bisitun, 35 kilometres east of Kermanshah. The inscription accom
panies a relief depicting the Achaemenid Persian king Darius I (r. 521
486 bc) receiving the submission of nine rebel chiefs and trampling
underfoot the usurper Bardiya. It was written in three languages: Old
Persian, Elamite and Babylonian, and the rock below was cut back so that
the inscription would not be defaced. The courage and ingenuity which
Rawlinson displayed were finally rewarded when, with the help of a local
24



Introduction
Kurdish boy, he obtained squeezes (impressions made on special dampened
paper) of all the inscriptions. Armed with these, he worked on the decipher
ment of the script. His notebooks were kept in the British Museum (they are
now in the British Library), as were the squeezes until, some fifty years
later, they were partly eaten by mice.
The Old Persian inscription was quasi-alphabetic and Rawlinson began
with this, as had Grotefend before him. A royal name, frequently repeated,
was written, like those of the Egyptian pharaohs, in a cartouche, or frame.
The number of signs gave the length of the name which, through a process of
trial and error, it was possible to identify with that of Darius, mentioned by
the Greek historians. The repetition of groups of signs following this name
could be equated with the title ‘king of kings’. And so, gradually, the values
of more and more of the signs were established. A further impetus to
Rawlinson’s cuneiform studies came when, in 1843, he became Resident in
Baghdad - the same post once occupied by Rich.
In the meantime, still with the aim of finding a better overland route to
India, an attempt had been made to sail down the Euphrates. To achieve
this, two paddle-steamers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, were sent out from
England in pieces and brought, with considerable difficulty, from the
Mediterranean coast to the River Euphrates at Carchemish, where they
were assembled and eventually set sail. On 21 May 1836 the Tigris sank
during a hurricane and twenty people were drowned. The expedition
established that the River Euphrates was not navigable, but that the Tigris
below Baghdad was. The benefit for Near Eastern archaeology was the
partial mapping of both river valleys, including the ancient sites along them,
more especially Nineveh and Nimrud in Assyria and Babylon south of
Baghdad. These maps, produced by Captain Felix Jones in 1852, are the
most accurate record of what the sites and the areas around them were like
before excavation, modern irrigation and roadworks changed them.
Meanwhile, another young Englishman, who was to have a profound
influence on Near Eastern archaeology and on the collections in the British
Museum, was also getting his first glimpse of the mounds. This was Austen
Henry Layard who, with a friend, set out in 1839, at the age of 22, to travel
overland to take up an appointment in Ceylon. Layard’s interest in Near
Eastern antiquities had already been fired by the published accounts of Rich
and other travellers. He later wrote several popular narratives of his own
adventures and excavations, which became best-sellers at the time and still
make very good reading on account of their lively style and enthusiasm. In
May 1840, after visiting the mounds of Nineveh and Nimrud, he continued
south to Baghdad where he stayed with Rawlinson’s predecessor at the
Residency, Colonel Taylor, learning much from him and from members of
his staff about the ancient remains of Mesopotamia. He then travelled east
into Iran, where he visited the rock inscription at Bisitun and spent lime

Layard at Nimrud in 1846, decorated with twenty small reliefs and with cuneiform inscriptions recording campaigns of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (r. 858-824 bc).

exploring Khuzistan, before abandoning the journey to Ceylon and return
ing to Baghdad. In 1842 he was sent by Taylor to the British Ambassador in
Constantinople, Sir Stratford Canning, who was later to help him diplo
matically and financially in his excavations. On his way, he stopped in
Mosul and met Paul Emile Botta, the French Consul, who was at that time
engaged in somewhat fruitless investigations in the mound of Kuyunjik, the
citadel of the ancient Assyrian capital Nineveh. In 1843, Botta moved to
Khorsabad, the one-generation Assyrian capital of Dur Sharrukin built by
Sargon II (r. 721-705 bc), where his excavations were more fruitful, and
many of his finds now grace the Louvre in Paris.
Layard eventually arrived in Constantinople, where he entered Canning’s
service and carried out various missions for him; however, the British
Government failed to make his appointment official. In 1845, therefore,
armed with an official firman, and with funds provided by Canning, Layard
returned to Mosul with the aim of excavating at Nimrud. He enlisted the
help of Christian Rassam, the British Vice-Consul in Mosul, and that of his
business partner, the Englishman H. J. Ross, and set off on 8 November to
sail down the Tigris to Nimrud. Layard spent a troubled night with ‘visions
of palaces underground, of gigantic monsters, of sculptured figures and
endless inscriptions’ floating before him. The next day he set his six Arab
workmen digging in two areas of the citadel mound, and by evening they
had located chambers decorated with inscribed stone slabs in two of the
palaces of this Assyrian capital of the ninth century bc. During the next few
days more chambers were located and the first of the famous Nimrud ivories
were excavated. (These ivories, together with Layard’s other finds, will be
studied in greater detail in Chapter 4.) Layard increased his force to thirty
workmen and discovered his first Assvrian reliefs on 28 November.
However, the local Turkish Pasha put an end to his activities by claiming,
wrongly, that he was disturbing Muslim graves, and the captain of the
Turkish troops stationed nearby was ordered to move headstones from a
neighbouring cemetery and re-erect them on the summit of the main mound
at Nimrud in order to give substance to the allegations.
While Layard was waiting for a new firman, which Canning obtained for
him from the Sultan, he visited the caravan city of Hatra and also undertook
some soundings on Kuyunjik, the citadel of Nineveh, where he uncovered
the human-headed bull colossi which guarded the Nergal Gate. Canning
also succeeded in convincing the Trustees of the British Museum that they
should fund Layard’s further researches. Although they agreed to do so,
they were parsimonious in the extreme and put Layard under pressure to
‘obtain the largest possible number of well-preserved objects of art at the
least possible outlay of time and money’. When he returned to Nimrud,
Layard excavated further reliefs which he prepared for shipment to England
by sawing off their backs and, where the designs were in two registers,
26



Introduction
111 cutting them in two in order to make them lighter for transport. Layard had
hoped that his Assyrian reliefs would be the first to reach Europe, but the
race was won by Botta who, thanks to the more effective backing of his
government and the greater means at his disposal, was able to ship his
Khorsabad reliefs more rapidly to France.
When, after a break during the summer, Layard resumed his excavations
at Nimrud in November 1846, the rate of his discoveries increased. Among
10 them was the Black Obelisk which is now one of the glories of the British
11 Museum. Its inscription provided the first independent confirmation of the
existence of an Israelite king named in the Old Testament. The Victorians
flocked to the British Museum to see the evidence.
Layard also arranged for one each of the human-headed, winged bulls and
12 lions which guarded the doorways of the palaces to be shipped to England
no mean feat, with the limited means at his disposal, since they are 3.5
metres tall and weigh almost 10 tons each. The lion colossus was attacked by
a band of robbers on its way to the river and bears a bullet mark as evidence.
In 1849 Rawlinson acquired and shipped to the British Museum two of the
human-headed, winged bulls and attendant figures which Botta had exca
113 vated at Khorsabad in 1843-4; these are 4.40 metres tall and weigh 28 tons.

Omri was not, in fact, Jehu’s father but Ahab’s, and he was the founder of the Israelite capital and dynasty in Samaria (I Kings 16: 15-28; II Kings 9-10).

In 1847, before his money ran out, Layard also carried out some work at
Qalaat Shergat, the site of the earliest Assyrian capital at Ashur. Here he was
surprised not to find the stone slabs which lined the walls of the palaces at
Nimrud and Nineveh and on which he relied for his location of the walls.
Without them as a guide, he was unable to differentiate between the mud
brick walls and the earth fill of the rooms and, indeed, dug through the walls
without recognising them. It was only some half a century later, when the
Germans had elaborated the technique of wall-tracing, that it became
possible to follow the line of mud-brick walls with any accuracy. Layard did
send back to the British Museum a large but fragmentary black stone
sculpture which, for years, was thought to represent King Shalmaneser III
but has now been identified by Julian Reade as a statue of the god Kidudu,
guardian of the city wall of Ashur, dedicated by Shalmaneser after his
restoration of the wall (wa 118886).

Introduction
Before he finally left for England, Layard made one other sounding into
the south-west corner of the mound of Kuyunjik where, he now realised, the
Assyrian levels were buried under a considerable depth of later debris. Here
he began to uncover the remains of the monumental facade of the South
West Palace of Sennacherib (r. 704-681 bc). This was a fitting climax to his
work in Assyria and brought to seven the number of Assyrian palaces which
he had excavated, ranging in date from the ninth to seventh centuries BC.
Official recognition left something to be desired, however, since it
consisted solely in his appointment as unpaid attache to the Embassy in
Constantinople. Furthermore, the Treasury refused a grant for the publica
tion of his finds. These, after much delay, finally arrived in October 1848 via
Bushire in Iran, Bombay in India, and Trincomalee in Ceylon, having
weathered a serious storm and unauthorised unpacking and pilfering which
resulted in the loss of much valuable information as to the origin of the
pieces. When his finds were eventually put on exhibition, and when his
popular account of their discovery was published, Layard found the recog
nition he received from the public was far more generous than that which he
had obtained from official sources.
However, by 1849, Layard was already on his way back to the Near East
to serve on the Turco-Persian Boundary Commission. When he reached
Constantinople, he found awaiting him a request to continue his Assyrian
explorations, for which a sum of £3,000, spread over two years, had been
allocated. He was also provided with a succession of assistants who were
selected for their skill as draughtsmen. Indeed, it was now recognised that
the adequate recording of the relief sculptures which he was uncovering was
of paramount importance; only relatively few were sufficiently well pre
served to be sent back to the British Museum, and those left uncovered
rapidly deteriorated when exposed to the rain and frosts of a winter in
northern Iraq. Work continued at Nimrud and at Nineveh, where the
South-West Palace of Sennacherib was excavated by means of a series of
deep, dark, airless, dusty and dangerous tunnels: one can but marvel at the
7 quality, quantity and accuracy of the drawings executed by Layard and his
assistants under these conditions. Seven huge folio albums of drawings
survive in the British Museum, some of which were subsequently engraved
and published. However, Layard was unlucky in his assistants: Cooper’s
health broke down, Bell was drowned and Hodder was young and inex
perienced, so it is fortunate that Layard was able to rely, for the direction of
the excavations, on the services of Hormuzd and Christian Rassam and
H.J. Ross. The scale of the undertaking was truly remarkable, for, as
Layard wrote:
In this huge edifice I had opened no less than seventy-one halls,
chambers and passages, whose walls, almost without exception, had

been panelled with slabs of sculptured alabaster recording the wars,
the triumphs, and the great deeds of the Assyrian king. By a rough
calculation, about 9,880 feet, or nearly two miles of bas-reliefs, with
twenty-seven portals, formed by colossal winged bulls and lion
sphinxes, were uncovered in that part alone of the building explored
during my researches.
This only takes account of the excavations in the South-West Palace, of
which a remarkably accurate plan was produced despite the difficulty of
surveying in tunnels. And finally, in addition to other objects found, Layard
uncovered two rooms piled with clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform. This
was the official library of the Assyrian kings in the seventh century BC and, 13
together with a second library subsequently excavated by Rassam, con
tained 20,000 tablets and fragments which are still being worked on by
scholars of all nationalities in the Students’ Room of the Department of
Western Asiatic Antiquities in the British Museum.

The body of the coffin and its lid are decorated with mould-impressed figures of soldiers, depicted frontally, and they are covered with green (originally blue) glaze. L. 1.95 cm.
When, after investigating further sites both in Assyria and in Babylonia
(many of them subsequently excavated by others with considerable suc
cess), Layard finally travelled home in 1851, he had been able to dispatch to
London more than 120 cases of antiquities. After the publication in 1853 of
his final record of his activities, Layard abandoned archaeology for politics.
He became in succession Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
Member of Parliament, Chief Commissioner of Works, and Ambassador in
Madrid and finally in Constantinople where he was again able to further the
work of the British Museum (see page 34 below). Upon his retirement to a
palace on the Grand Canal in Venice he acquired paintings which he
subsequently bequeathed to the National Gallery in London. After his
death, his widow bequeathed to the British Museum his papers and the
jewellery made up of ancient Near Eastern seals which Layard had given her
two weeks before their wedding. Several of the Assyrian reliefs which
adorned a porch in his father-in-law’s house, subsequently used as the tuck
shop in a school, were sold in 1959, and one was acquired by the British
Museum. A further relief was later discovered under layers of whitewash
and was sold to a Japanese collection in 1994.
Layard’s assistant Hormuzd Rassam continued work in northern Iraq, at
Nimrud and at Nineveh, where he found the famous lion hunt in the North 14
Palace of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (r. 668-627 bc). Technically this 121-3
was in an area allocated to the French archaeologist Victor Place, so Rassam
had to excavate at night - not the best conditions for recording and salvaging
objects. Place was obliged to accept the fait accompli and fortunately the
discovery of the second library of cuneiform tablets was carried out under
better conditions. Rassam went to London in April 1853 and Rawlinson
encouraged William Kennet Loftus and the artist William Boutcher to move
to Kuyunjik to continue Rassam’s work. In 1855 two events led to a
temporary halt in excavations. One was the Crimean War; the other was the
loss of a whole shipload of antiquities and reliefs, most of them destined for 16
the Louvre and including some of the Ashurbanipal reliefs, waylaid and
capsized by brigands in the lower reaches of the Tigris.
Before working in the north Loftus had, in 1850, explored the mound
strewn plain between the Euphrates and the Tigris south of Baghdad. He
had eventually carried out some excavations at Uruk, where the Germans
have since found extensive remains dating back to the fourth millennium
bc. Loftus had been able to return with some antiquities (now in the British
Museum), including wall cones which had decorated columns and pilasters
of the late fourth millennium bc, and three Parthian clay coffins dating some 15
three thousand years later. He had also excavated some other sites in the
vicinity, among them ancient Larsa and Tell Sifr, where he found a hoard of
copper implements and part of an archive of cuneiform tablets. Between
1852 and 1854 Loftus carried out soundings at Susa, in south-western Iran, 101

Introduction
and identified an Achaemenid palace of the fifth to fourth centuries bc.
Subsequent excavation in Iran, and especially at Susa, was to be predomi
nantly in the hands of the French.
Further work in the south had taken place, again at Rawlinson’s instiga
tion, at the site of Tell Muqqayar, where the British Vice-Consul at Basra,
J. G. Taylor, found the inscribed foundation figurines of the huge ziggurat,
or temple tower, and Rawlinson was able to identify the site as the city of Ur,
mentioned in the Bible as the original home of Abraham. The British were
to return to Ur after the First World War (see page 64 below). The sites of
Eridu and Borsippa were also identified by foundation inscriptions.
George Smith’s discovery of the tablet containing an Assyrian version of
13 the Flood story led to renewed interest in Near Eastern excavation after a
break of almost twenty years. Funded by the Daily Telegraph, Smith himself
went out to Nineveh and succeeded in finding missing fragments of the
Flood account. He was sent out twice more by the British Museum but died
near Aleppo on his way home in 1876. Hormuzd Rassam, who had in the
meantime lived in Aden and elsewhere, was back in London and was asked
to resume work on the Museum’s behalf. While Rassam was waiting for his
16 Drawing published in 1849 by the French excavators P. E. Botta and E. Flandin of a relief, now lost, from the palace of the Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721705 bc) al Khorsabad in northern Iraq. It shows the sack of the temple at Mu$a§ir, on the borders of Urartu, during Sargon's eighth campaign in 714 bc.

firman in Constantinople, Layard was appointed Ambassador to the Porte
and was able to obtain for him a generous concession authorising him to
work in eastern Turkey, north Syria and Mesopotamia.
Rassam has been criticised for his methods ofexcavation but he was, in fact,
acting as requested by the Museum, which still wished to obtain as many
antiquities as possible for the smallest financial outlay. He has been accused of
not keeping records, but photographs and plans have subsequently been
found in the Museum’s archives. Certainly his brief, and the Museum’s
inability to find a replacement for him, meant that he had to rely on largely
unsupervised teams of workmen. However, during his excavations between
1878 and 1882, Rassam succeeded in finding the bronze strips decorating two
sets of Assyrian gates at Balawat, an extensive archive of cuneiform tablets 1
dating to between 1900 and 1600 bc and many other antiquities from Sippar
in Babylonia, some Urartian objects from a temple at Toprakkale near Lake 132-5
Van in eastern Turkey, and a large number of tablets and objects from such
prestigious sites as Babylon, Borsippa and Nineveh.
Unfortunately, Rassam’s method, or lack of it, involved putting trenches
into so many sites that the attention of dealers was alerted and this led to
illicit digging on a large scale, often by the very men Rassam had left to
guard the sites. Wallis Budge, then an assistant and later a Keeper in the
British Museum, went out to Mesopotamia in 1888; on his way, in Egypt, he
was able to acquire some of the famous Amarna Letters - the diplomatic
correspondence, on cuneiform tablets, with the Egyptian pharaohs of the
middle of the fourteenth century BC. In Baghdad, Budge purchased objects
looted from the sites, many of which he visited. He also returned to
Kuyunjik and, in 1889, to Der, near Sippar, only to discover that Der had
been looted before he arrived, so that he was obliged to buy back the finds
from the dealers. Budge blamed Rassam for the unsatisfactory situation he
had found in 1888, and denied the latter’s claim that he had excavated the
Balawat Gates at the site of that name. The general ill-feeling culminated, in
1893, in an action for slander which was won by Rassam. He was further
vindicated when, in 1956, another set of gates (now in Baghdad) was found
at Balawat by the British School of Archaeology in Iraq.
Meanwhile, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the growing
interest in Classical studies encouraged a number of enterprising travellers
and scholars to go to the Middle East. The ruins of Palmyra in the Syrian 164-5
Desert were visited by Robert Wood and James Dawkins, whose abund
antly illustrated account, published in 1753, was to have a great influence on
the neoclassical revival led by the Adam brothers and their contemporaries.
Others visited the Greek and Roman sites on the west and south coasts of
Turkey. Some of these travellers continued eastwards into Phrygia and
beyond, to the Hittite ruins at Bogazkby and the rock-cut shrine nearby at 17
Yazihkaya; among them were John Robert Steuart and William Hamilton, 18

Introduction
who both published accounts of their investigations in 1842. In his excava
tions at Hissarhk from 1870 onwards, the eccentric retired German busi
nessman Heinrich Schliemann was also pursuing his search for the Greeks,
convinced that he had found the site of the Homeric city of Troy. He
discovered several rich hoards of metalwork which he dated to the time of
the Trojan wars, around 1200 bc, and it was only later that their true dating
in the third millennium bc could be demonstrated. Some of his finds have
reached the British Museum. Large amounts of pottery of a similar date
were found in 1900-1 by Paul Gaudin at the cemetery site of Yortan, south
east of Troy, of which a substantial proportion was later acquired by the
British Museum.
In 1876, A.H. Sayce drew attention to the similarities between some
hieroglyphic inscriptions carved on stone, which had been found at Aleppo
and Hama in Syria, and the inscriptions cut on the rock-faces at Bogazkoy
and Yazihkaya; he suggested that they might have been carved by the
Hittites who were known from the Bible. That same year George Smith, the
discoverer of the Flood Tablet, copied a similar inscription on the back of a

site on the River Euphrates, on the Syrian-Turkish border. In fact, the
statue had first been recorded by Alexander Drummond, British Consul in
Aleppo, who had published his findings in 1754 and believed it to be ‘the
tomb of some dignified Christian clergyman in his sacerdotal vestments’.
Smith identified the site as Carchemish, but he died in August that same
year and so did not live to see his intuition confirmed by the excavations
mounted by the British Museum between 1878 and 1881 under the director
ship of P. Henderson. Between 1911 and 1914 the excavations were
resumed by D. G. Hogarth and C. L. Woolley, with T. E. Lawrence (of
Arabia) as assistant, again for the Museum, and there was a final short
season in 1920 before the site became part of a military area. Many of the
Carchemish finds, and casts of others, are in the British Museum, together 125
with material purchased by the excavators from various cemetery sites in
north Syria, among them Amarna (not to be confused with the site of that
name in Egypt) and Deve Hiiyuk.
Attracted by the presence of further Hittite inscriptions, John Garstang
undertook excavations at Sakcegozii in southern Turkey between 1907 and
1911. Later, between 1936 and 1938 he excavated a prehistoric mound just
outside Mersin on the south coast of Turkey. At both sites he uncovered a
sequence of remains going back to the sixth millennium bc, and he donated
collections of sherds to the British Museum.
Further east, the presence of rock-cut cuneiform inscriptions in the
neighbourhood of Lake Van had attracted the notice of early travellers and
members of the Turco-Persian Boundary Commission. In the 1870s atten
tion was drawn to some bronzes which were said to have come from the site
of Toprakkale, just east of Van; some of these were acquired for the British 131-3
Museum by Layard, who also arranged for Rassam to excavate the site, and
more bronzes were found in the remains of a temple. The Museum was also
able to obtain large numbers of cuneiform tablets and sealed clay envelopes 73b
from an unspecified site in central Turkey from which they were being
looted by the local farmers during the 1880s; subsequently they were
identified as the correspondence of Assyrian merchants of the early second
millennium BC and it was established that the site from which they came was
Kiiltepe (see Chapter 3). A large collection of material - mostly bronze 72
weapons and amulets, and some pottery - from graves of the Koban culture
of the eleventh to seventh centuries BC in the Caucasus, was presented by
Prince Noruz Orousbekov in 1913.
The Russian political ambitions in Central Asia referred to earlier were
countered by diplomatic missions to the court of the Shah such as that, in
1810, of Sir Gore Ouseley, who was accompanied by his brother William
and by James Morier. They published accounts of their travels, recorded
the antiquities, and brought back fragments of reliefs from Persepolis,

which are now in the British Museum. However, it was the Russians who
sent Robert Ker Porter to Iran specifically to to record the ancient monu
ments; this he did in a magnificent series of drawings and watercolours,
19 some of which are preserved in the Department of Manuscripts in the
British Library, and eighty-seven of which were published in 1822.
The Punic colonies founded bv the Phoenicians in the western Mediterra
•* nean were chiefly associated in the public imagination with Carthage,
Hannibal, and child sacrifice in the areas known as tophets. In the 1850s, the
Reverend Nathan Davis, acting on behalf of the British Government,
carried out excavations in and around Carthage, near Tunis. In addition to
some fine Roman mosaics, he brought back over a hundred Punic stelae of
the fourth to second centuries bc which he had found reused in later Roman
walls; when, in 1921, the tophet of Carthage was discovered (the British
Museum has some burial urns from the tophet excavations), it became clear
that most of these stelae had originally come from there. Davis also
purchased a number of neo-Punic stelae of the Roman period from various
sites. In 1856 the British Museum bought the ‘Great Sardinian Collection’ of
antiquities excavated on the Tharros promontory on the west coast of
Sardinia by Gaetano Cara, Director of the Royal Museum of Cagliari. The
130 objects - including spectacular jewellery and seals - came from tombs of
I46d Phoenico-Punic and Roman date.
166-9 The British Museum’s collection of antiquities from the Arabian penin
sula - mostly from what is now the Yemen - was largely donated by political
officers and military personnel, beginning with an important gift in 1862 by
Colonel Coghlan of the Royal Artillery of bronze votive plaques inscribed in
the bold, well-balanced South Arabian alphabet developed before the
middle of the first millennium BC and used well into the Christian era.
Earlier material, including ivories, was excavated in 1889 by Mr and Mrs
Bent and in 1925 by E. Mackay in grave tumuli on the the island of Bahrain;
the dating is problematic but is probably around 2000 bc.
By 1900 a more scientific approach to archaeology was developing in
Mesopotamia. German excavators at Ashur and Babylon evolved the
methods of tracing mud-brick walls which are now used on all Near Eastern
excavations and, because it had begun to be recognised that the context in
which objects were found was important, more careful records were kept.
The British returned yet again to Nineveh under the directorship of L. W.
King (1903-4) and R. Campbell Thompson (1904-5 and 1929-32).
After the First World War, the Ottoman Empire collapsed and its
provinces were divided up between France, which took over Syria and the
Lebanon as its mandate, and Britain, which assumed control of Jordan and
44r.,46, Iraq. Important excavations were carried out by H. R. Hall at al ‘Ubaid,
29 where a temple of around 2500 bc and a cemetery of around 4000 bc were
excavated. Hall also initiated work at Ur, which J. G. Taylor had already

investigated in 1853-4, and was succeeded there by Leonard Woolley.
Working for the British Museum and the University Museum in Phila
delphia, Woolley excavated and published finds from all periods of the
3,000-year history of the site, including the so-called Royal Cemetery of 47-50
about 2600 bc which caught the public imagination. According to a new 53-7
antiquities law, finds were divided between these two institutions and the
museum in Baghdad, founded by Gertrude Bell. One of Woolley’s team,
Max Mallowan, investigated the early levels at Nineveh by means of a deep
sounding, as well as the small prehistoric site of Arpachiyah, also near 23r.,27
Mosul.
In 1931, after the end of the British Mandate in Iraq, a change in the
antiquities law meant that for several years there was no division of finds. As
a result, the foreign teams working in the country moved elsewhere, mostly
to Syria, where Mallowan undertook a survey of sites in the area of the River
Khabur, the main tributary of the Euphrates. He carried out several
soundings and excavated Tell Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak; excavations at 24/.,
the latter site have since been revived under the directorship of David Oates 26,28
and, since 1994, of Roger Matthews. From 1949 onwards, Mallowan
returned to Nimrud, where he excavated on the citadel; Oates later dug a
large Assyrian palace of the ninth century bc at the south-east corner of the
site, which is known as Fort Shalmaneser and which had been used by the
38



Introduction
Assyrians as an arsenal and store-house. In the 1960s Oates excavated a
temple site of the second and first millennium bc at Tell el Rimah west of
Mosul, and his wife, Joan Oates, excavated a prehistoric site at Choga Mami
in the foothills of the Zagros. Julian Reade dug a third- to second
millennium bc site at Tell Taya, also west of Mosul, and more recently has
been excavating in Oman on behalf of the British Museum. Further changes
in the Iraq antiquities law meant that the British Museum was able to receive
a share of the finds.
Despite yet another change in the law in 1969, which no longer allows the
export of antiquities from Iraq, the British Museum was in the field again in
1989, at Nimrud and Balawat, under the directorship of John Curtis. From
1983 onwards, Curtis had also directed rescue excavations north of Eski
Mosul, where a dam was being constructed; both series of excavations had
the aim of establishing a firmer chronology for many of the objects brought
back to the Museum in the nineteenth centurv.
Apart from the work of W. K. Loftus at Susa in 1852-4, excavations in
Iran have been most actively pursued by the French. A collection of
149,150 magnificent Achaemenid gold and silver artefacts formed part of the ‘Oxus
Treasure’, the chance discovery of which is described in Chapter 4 and
which is now mostly in the British Museum. In the 1930s the British
Museum also acquired large collections of material from the Iranian surveys
and excavations of Sir Aurel Stein (1862-1943). This remarkable man was
born in Budapest, partly educated in London and spent most of his life
working in India. Between 1900 and 1916 he used India as a base for his
three famous Central Asian archaeological expeditions and surveys, includ
ing his discovery of the ‘Cave of a Thousand Buddhas’ at Dunhuang. In
order to trace contacts between the Indus Valley cultures and Mesopotamia,
Stein undertook a series of expeditions between 1927 and 1936. It is the
objects he discovered during his surveys and soundings in Iran which
concern us here: they cover all periods from the Neolithic onwards and
include material from the important Iron Age site of Hasanlu, since
excavated by the Americans. In 1938-9 Stein also carried out aerial and
surface surveys from the upper reaches of the Tigris in Iraq to the Gulf of
Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea, and the results of all this work
were published in 1937 and 1940. Further material came to the Museum
from the private collection built up in the 1920s and 1930s by Ernst
Herzfeld, much of it acquired in Nahavand and alleged to be from the site of
Tepe Giyan. The founding ofa British Institute of Persian Studies in Tehran
in 1961 led to British excavations at a number of sites, including David
Stronach’s at the Median site of Tepe Nush-i Jan and the early Achaemenid
capital of Pasargadae, and Clare Goffs at the site of Baba Jan; the British
Museum also supported Charles Burney’s excavations at Haftavan and
received objects from all these sites.

Ancient Near Eastern Art
As the aim of this Introduction has been primarily to present the
background to the British Museum’s Near Eastern collections, this survey
has necessarily been biased. Some periods and areas are poorly represented
in the Museum’s collections. There is, for instance, very little early Neo
lithic material from sites other than Jericho because this has mostly been 20
excavated in recent decades when more restrictive antiquities laws have
been in force. There are also relatively few artefacts from excavations in
Syria, the Lebanon and Iran because these areas have been in the predomi
nantly French sphere of operations, and the Turks have not allowed
material out of Turkey since their antiquities laws came into force after the
First World War.
In this book we shall be concentrating on the Museum’s strengths.
Indeed, the British Museum houses one of the three great collections of
Ancient Near Eastern antiquities (the others are in the Louvre in Paris
and the Berlin Museums), and in the following chapters we shall be focusing
on a selection of these in order to trace the development of Ancient Near
Eastern art.
40



CHAPTER I
From Village to Town:
before 3000 bc
T
he Bible tells us that the walls of Jericho came tumbling down as the
Israelites entered the Promised Land, but long before this, the site had
been used for the flimsy huts of hunters who camped around a natural spring
and built a small sanctuary there some 12,000 years ago. Other traces of
these hunters and food gatherers have been found round Mount Carmel,
and here small items of jewellery and a decorated bone pin are early evidence
of the human urge to expend time and effort on decorating a utilitarian
object. By about 7000 BC, the descendants of the Jericho hunters had settled
in more substantial mud-brick houses and were experimenting with the
domestication of plants and animals.
6 Jericho is a large tell which lies in the fertile Jordan valley, beside a road
leading from a crossing of the river up into the Judaean hills and to
Jerusalem. The excavation of the earliest levels by John Garstang and later
by Kathleen Kenyon (see pages 21-2) revealed that the early inhabitants,
who did not yet know pottery (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A), felt the need to
protect themselves behind huge walls and ditches dug out of the bed-rock.
An impressive tower, perhaps one of several, was excavated; it was round,
10 metres in diameter, stone-built, and still survived to the height of 8.5
20 metres; it had a stairway inside it. The treatment of skulls found in the
slightly later Pre-Pottery Neolithic B level at Jericho, and at other sites in
Palestine and Syria, betrayed evidence of the care lavished on the dead in
what was evidently a widespread burial custom: Jericho was part ofwhat can
be recognised as a culture.
Another manifestation of this culture took the form of lime plaster
statues of a type known from fragmentary examples at Jericho. In 1983,
however, at least twenty-five were found in a Pre-Pottery Neolithic B

21 above right Examples of the two types of Neolithic plaster figures from Ain Ghazal near Amman in Jordan. The eyes are made of pure while plaster; a black bituminous substance is used to indicate the irises, with the addition of dioptase (an unusual green mineral pigment) to outline the eyes.

context at Ain Ghazal just outside Amman, and a further cache was 21
discovered in 1985. They were probably ritually buried after use in some
religious cult or ceremony. The figures were built up over an armature of
reeds and twine, now perished leaving a hollow. Sexual features were rarely
indicated (only three had breasts and only one of these had genitalia). The
faces of both types are carefully modelled but, as with the skulls (see Fig.
20), the eyes and the nose are emphasised at the expense of the mouth. Two
of these figures will become the property of the British Museum after
conservation.
Thus, by 6000 bc there had already been established the pattern of
religious and funerary context which accompanies so many of the objects we
shall be examining during the course of this survey. What is intentionally
buried survives better than what is in daily use and finally discarded after
being worn out or broken, and better also than the prestige objects which
filled the temples and palaces and which were looted, broken up and melted
down, stripped of their gold and precious stones or deliberately smashed.

In the early levels at Jericho obsidian blades were found. Obsidian is a
shiny, generally black, volcanic glass which was exported from the area of
Hasan Dag - a volcano in central Turkey (obsidian from deposits in eastern
Turkey was exported to other parts of the Near East). One of the sites which
prospered from this trade was Qatal Hiiyuk in the Konya Plain west of the
volcano. Here houses were found built up against each other, with com
munication between them taking place at roof level. Some of the ‘houses’
seem to have been used as shrines and were decorated with wall-paintings:
there were geometric patterns and hand-impressions but some were more
elaborate and depicted vultures, hunting scenes and a ceremony involving a
huge bull. There were also painted plaster reliefs of goddesses giving birth,
and pairs of leopards facing each other which literally changed their spots
with each seasonal repainting. The dead were buried beneath the floors - a
custom found throughout the Near East at many periods; with them were a
variety of objects including jewellery, obsidian mirrors, beautifully worked
obsidian knives and bell hooks. Figurines of clay and stone represented
naked women, many of them very fat with their hair in top-knots, often
paired with young men.
It is no accident that figures such as the Venus of Willendorf (about
30,000 bc) and others like her always appear among the earliest artefacts
illustrated in any world history of art. In the types of figurines produced by
prehistoric cultures we have a window onto their world. The figurines
reflect not only the religious beliefs but also the conventions governing the
representations of the human form - what, in a later context, might be
termed an artistic convention. Wall-paintings might have provided an
equally useful window, had they survived more often, but the figurines,
generally made of clay and representing women, are widespread and varied.
However, since, within a given area and time-frame, they form groups
reflecting ethnic, social or trade contacts, they often provide good evidence
for the existence of ‘cultures’. A culture is most often referred to by the name
of the site where it was first recognised. Some of the figurines in the British
Museum can serve as examples.
Representative of the Hacilar culture of Turkey is a small figurine which
also served as a pot. It dates to around 5000 BC. The pot shape does not
explain the omission of sexual features, which is intentional. On this piece
the nose and ears are indicated by protuberances but the mouth and eyes are
not shown; in other cases, as with the earlier figures from Jericho and Ain
Ghazal, the eyes are given prominence by being encrusted with chips of
obsidian.
A clay figurine of about the same date may have come from the south coast
ofTurkey. In outline it is not unlike the pot figurine or the smaller of the Ain
Ghazal figures, but the hands and feet are both given prominence. Again no
sexual features are depicted, although the navel is indicated by a rosette
22 Clay figurine which also served as a pot, painted with zigzags, triangles and bands of red paint typical of the pottery of the Hacilar culture. Lugs pierced for suspension form the arms, but because of the pot shape no feel or legs are represented. About 5000 bc. Ill 11.5 cm.

pattern and the hands may be cupped over breasts. The face is dominated by
huge eyes; no other facial features, ears or hair are shown.
We are left in no doubt, however, as to the sex of a stone figurine from
Arpachiyah in northern Iraq belonging to the Halaf culture (about 5000- 23r.
4500 bc): she has small breasts but a huge pubic triangle. She has no arms or
legs, her face is tilted upwards and the only facial feature is a small nose.
Other figures from Arpachiyah are made of clay, painted red, and have
breasts but neither head, arms, nor legs. A painted clay figure from Chagar 24/.
Bazar in north-east Syria, which also belongs to the Halaf culture, shows
another stylisation with an equally strong - but different - emphasis on the
sexual features. She sits with her huge thighs extended and supports her
jutting breasts. Her head is missing: in other figures of this type the face is
pinched out to form a large nose or chin but is otherwise featureless. Neither
hands nor feet are shown.

corner of the Mediterranean; a small stone figurine from this area, dating to
around 4500 bc, shows the influence of the Halaf culture. The pose is
naturalistic but there is something hostile about this craggy female. Her
small, featureless head pokes forward between hunched shoulders, her back
is hollowed and she has large, jutting breasts, but her arms do not extend
beyond the elbows. The standing figurines of the same period from southern 25
Iraq are completely different; with their broad shoulders emphasised by
paint or clay pellets, narrow waists and hips, and thin, elongated thighs,
they are a strange mixture of naturalism and stylisation. Some hold babies
on their hips and suckle them from their small pointed breasts; some are
male. The genitals are shown naturalistically but without any undue
emphasis. The most distinctive feature of these figures is the reptilian
stylisation of the heads, which has given them their name of ‘lizard’
44



From Village to Town: before 3000 BC
figurines. The elongated skulls, often decorated with bitumen, may rep
resent the deformation due to binding in infancy. The long, slit eyes are
shaped like coffee-beans and they and the mouth are often painted. Several
of these figurines have been found in graves.
About a millennium later, thousands of votive stone plaques were
26 deposited at Tell Brak in north Syria, in the foundations ofthe Eye Temple
so-called because of the emphasis on the eyes which were cut out and incised
on the plaques to the exclusion of almost any other feature. Sometimes two
pairs or whole families of eyes are depicted. This stylisation is completely
28 different from that of a small, far more naturalistic, stone head from a
composite statue, also found in a deposit below the Eye Temple. This head
from Brak is an early, tentative attempt at sculpture in the round, and
demonstrates a search for realism that was to become dominant in the art of
the Near East; in southern Mesopotamia it was accompanied by dramatic
changes. However, before we turn to these, we must examine another
vehicle for artistic expression in the Near East, namely pottery.
For some 2,500 years after its invention in about 6000 BC, pottery was hand
made. This does not mean it was crude: some types of pottery were very fine,
with a range of complex shapes. In Syria and Palestine pottery was generally
undecorated or merely finished with a slip and burnished. In Turkey, the
22 Hacilar culture, which produced the pot figurine discussed above, is
characterised by thick-walled jars and bowls covered with bold designs in red
paint on a buffground .his found predominantly in the lake district ofsouth
west Turkey, but sherds have been excavated as far afield as Mersin on the
south coast. The finest pottery, however, came from northern Mesopotamia
where whirling designs, sometimes derived from human or animal shapes,
adorned the interior of the wide, shallow bowls of the Samarra culture
(around 5500 bc). In addition to figurines ofthe type discussed above, the site
ofArpachiyah in northern Iraq produced, during the Halaf period, a range of
27 beautiful but more static designs painted in one or two colours. Some of the
designs show increasing stylisation, for instance from naturalistic bulls’
heads into figures-of-eight. The Ubaid culture succeeded the Halaf and was
first recognised in southern Iraq, whence it seems to have spread; it is
25 characterised not only by ‘lizard figurines’ but by vessels made on a slow
29 wheel which are often fired a distinctive green and decorated with bold
30-31 designs. Around 4000 bc, potters in Iran were also producing attractive
painted pottery. Some five hundred years later, the potter’s wheel was
invented and wheel-made pottery gradually replaced pottery made by hand;
however, these mass-produced wares were generally left undecorated.
Between 3500 and 3100 BC there developed in southern Iraq a distinctive
culture centred on the city of Uruk (also called Warka, the Erech of the
Bible). As we saw in the Introduction (page 14), a complex administration
was needed to regulate the canal and irrigation system which allowed

agriculture to flourish in southern Iraq. The production of a surplus led to
the establishment of a trade network on an unprecedented scale, and the
Uruk culture spread eastwards to include Susa in Iran and northwards along
the Euphrates valley, where colonies were established in Syria and Turkey.
Writing developed to satisfy the bureaucratic needs of the Uruk administra
tion (see page 22). It seems that this administration was centred on the
temple, and the importance of this institution is reflected in the remains of
monumental architecture which have been excavated at the site: a huge
complex of temples included one building which was 80 metres long and
elaborately decorated with alternating niches and buttresses. Another build
ing had enormous free-standing and engaged columns whose surfaces were
coated with mud-plaster into which were pressed small clay cones, the ends
of which had been dipped into red or black paint so as to form a mosaic of
geometric patterns. Large-scale sculptures were carved from imported
stone. The realism of the ‘Warka Head’ testifies to a new approach to the 32
representation of the human form of which the Tell Brak head was an earlier
and cruder manifestation. The terracotta head of a sheep (wa 132092) and
the stone body of a bull (WA 116686) - part of a composite figure - display
the same realism.
This realism is also apparent in relief sculpture, for instance on a trough 33
from Uruk and on two enigmatic objects known as the ‘Blau Monuments’ 34
after an early owner. These show the ‘priest-king’, so-called because he
appears in religious and secular contexts. He has a rounded beard and
bunched hair, worn with a distinctive thick hair-band, and he wears a criss
cross patterned skirt. The priest-king also appears twice on a basalt relief in
Baghdad, where he shoots at one lion and spears another, and on a seal 35a
where he shoots at bulls. He uses a composite bow - a short bow made of
several different layers of wood and bone to give it the necessary elasticity

for which this is some of the earliest evidence. The stele and seal are detailed
enough for the type of arrow to be identifiable: it has a transverse head - a
flint set sideways-on into the shaft - and this type of arrow was also used in
contemporary Egypt. Ever since the beginnings of agriculture and domes
s.tication, one of the most important tasks of the leader of any community was
the organisation at regular intervals of hunts to free the countryside of
predatory lions and stampeding herds of wild bulls. This task continued to

be considered a duty of kings as late as the first millennium bc, when it
formed part of a specially organised royal hunt ending in a religious
ceremony (see pages 152-3).
The Uruk priest-king also appears in various other roles on seals - feeding
flocks, defeating the enemy, or standing before containers of temple provi
sions. He is depicted at the head of a procession of offering-bearers before
the goddess Inanna (or her priestess) on a tall stone vase carved with friezes
in relief, known as the ‘Warka Vase’ (Baghdad). Some sculptures show him
naked but with the same distinctive head-band (Louvre and Zurich). As an
illustration of trade contacts, however, the most interesting representation
of the priest-king is on the ivory handle of a knife found at Jebel el-Araq in
Egypt. This is one of many indications of links between Mesopotamia and
Egypt just before 3000 bc. The Egyptians adopted the cylinder seal (see
page 53 below), and probably learnt the principle of writing from Meso
potamia, but they invented their own hieroglyphic script. Contemporary
Egyptian architecture shows a similar use of wall-cones, buttresses and
niches, and several of the palettes and knife handles display examples of
34 The 'Blau Monuments'. One side of the chisel is entirely inscribed; on the other are the 'priest-king' holding an animal offering, and a half-kneeling workman (right). Three similar workmen and the 'priest-king', with hands raised, appear on one side of the scraper (bottom left). 1'he workmen may be making stone vessels similar to the ‘Warka Vase' and to that carried by the 'priest-king' on the other side of the scraper, where he stands before a woman with hands raised (top left). The authenticity of the Blau Monuments has been questioned but they were known long before the excavations at Uruk revealed the archaic script and objects depicting the 'priest-king'. Dark green slaty schist (phyllite). About 3100 bc. L. of scraper 16 cm.

borrowed iconography, some of it clearly based on contacts not only with
Mesopotamia but with Elam (south-western Iran) and Syria.
However, it was in the miniature reliefs of a new type of seal, designed to
satisfy the requirements of the administration, that the realism of the Uruk
period found its fullest expression. The cylinder seal, as its name implies, is
a cylinder, generally of stone, with a hole drilled through it from end to end
and with a design cut into its surface. When the cylinder is rolled out on a
soft material, the design appears in relief. In the Near East the seals were
rolled out on clay which, as we saw on page 22, was the main writing
material but was also used for securing containers and the locks of store
rooms. Many of the ancient sealings have survived and the designs of the
seals can be reconstructed. Thousands of actual cylinder seals have also
survived and the illustrations in this book will mostly show modern
impressions from them. As the cylinder is rolled out, so the design will
repeat itself, and seal cutlers made ample use of the design possibilities
provided by this frieze-like repetition. During the next 3,000 years they
created the most exquisite miniature reliefs which give information about

gods, goddesses, kings and queens, what the temples and palaces looked
like, how people dressed at different periods and in different areas, day-to
day activities, sport, sex, musical instruments, banquets, warfare and
myths.
35a, 37 Two of the seals illustrated here belong to the Uruk style, so-called
because seals and impressions found at Uruk are of this type; generally they
are large, and they are often unperforated, with carved knobs. It is now
35b known that the Jemdet Nasr style of seal overlaps with the Uruk style
chronologically, but the two types are easy to differentiate: the Jemdet Nasr
seals are small and squat, with drilled designs often executed on coloured
stones. They mostly depict women with pigtails, seated on mats or plat
forms and engaged in activities associated with textile or pottery production.
The drilled style on coloured stones is also found on contemporary seal
amulets in the shape of animals, many of which have been excavated at Tell
35c Brak. One type, showing a half-kneeling pigtailed figure, is probably from
south-western Iran. These seal-amulets are derived from earlier amulets and
stamp seals which have been found all over the Near East. The earliest were
decorated with simple intersecting lines forming criss-cross patterns. Later
35d seals show animals and some, in a distinctive gable-shape, come from north
Syria and south and central Turkey and date between 4000 and 3000 bc.
35e Some handsome large circular seals of about the same date from western
Iran show animal-headed figures grasping snakes, but it is impossible to say
whether these are demons, masked hunters or masked priests.
The art of the Near East was profoundly influenced by the developments
of the Uruk period. Not only did the innovations in the fields of pottery
making, architecture, sculpture, seals and writing have a lasting impact, but
certain pictorial conventions and iconographical creations originated at this
36 time. For instance, a limestone cup of this period is carved with supporting
‘hero’ figures in high relief. As we shall see in the next chapter, heroes of this
56a type reappear several centuries later in the art of the late Early Dynastic and
59a-c Akkadian periods.

D
uring the earlier part of the third millennium BC the administration in
Mesopotamia continued to be controlled by the temple. This period is
known as the Early Dynastic period and is conventionally divided into
three, although a two-fold division seems more appropriate for certain
areas. Writing developed further, so that information other than ration lists
and simple trade transactions could be recorded. From the more complex
texts we can identify the language in which they were written as Sumerian,
after Sumer - at that time the name for southern Iraq. Although it cannot be
proved, it is likely that the early inhabitants of Uruk were Sumerian,
because there is no indication of a break in continuity between the Uruk and
Early Dynastic periods. The country did, however, fragment into a series of
city-states which were often fighting among themselves - generally over
water rights.
As a result, Sumer appears to have participated less actively in the trade
networks of the Near East. These shifted from the main river valleys to an
arc running from Susa in the south-east to Syria in the north-west along the
foothills marking the boundaries ofeastern and northern Mesopotamia. The
main evidence for this trade comes in the form of an international cylinder
seal style referred to as Piedmont (from the foothills where it occurs) or
Ninevite 5 (from the level in the deep sounding at Nineveh where it was first
recognised). Tall, thin seals are decorated with ladder patterns, hatched
circles, centre-dot circles, rosettes or cruciform patterns. Actual seals in this 38a
style and their impressions have been found throughout this area, but only
very rarely in Sumer.
However, in addition to the international style, each area had its own
regional style. A particularly fine cylinder seal illustrates one of the styles 38b

found in the Diyala region north-east of Baghdad. Another regional style,
the Proto-Elamite style, developed in south-western Iran in the area known 38c
as Elam. Proto-Elamite seals never show humans but often depict animals
behaving like human beings. This phenomenon is not restricted to seals: a
small statue of a lioness (Brooklyn Museum, New York) stands on its
hindlegs in a twisted posture while pressing its forepaws together, and a
kneeling silver bull (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), clad in a
patterned skirt, raises a tall, spouted cup between its front hooves. Some of
the postures adopted by the animals, and some of the stylised plants and
other motifs which surround them on the seals, are dlso found on seals and
58

pottery from sites beyond the eastern borders of Iran, in the Indus Valley.
This would indicate early trade contacts which were extended during the
next few centuries.
On Sumerian cylinder seals, humans are often depicted taking part in
banquets and sometimes engaged in ritual sex. A particularly interesting
group of seal impressions bears what look like random patterns; however,
38d upon closer inspection they turn out to be the stylised writing of the names of
certain Sumerian cities. Not only do these city-seals indicate that the Susa
Syria trade network had its counterpart in a federation of Sumerian cities,
but they are perhaps the earliest evidence for the transformation of the
cuneiform script into art.
The tradition of decorated pottery had not entirely died out. In the Diyala
region around 2800 bc, ‘Scarlet Ware’ developed from an earlier and
39 simpler type of painted pottery. Handsome jars are decorated with scarlet
and black paint, and although some of the designs are geometric patterns,
others are more elaborate. At Nineveh, and at a number of other sites in
40 northern Mesopotamia, the so-called Ninevite 5 pottery appears in painted
and in incised and impressed wares in a variety of attractive shapes. In
comparison the pottery from Sumer is plain and utilitarian; some ornament
is applied to upright handles and footed stands, although this is generally
crude. In a cemetery at Yortan in western Turkey, dating from about 2700 to
2500 bc and excavated in 1900-1, Paul Gaudin found burials of between
one and six adults in huge jars. With the bodies were hand-made, black
burnished vessels, some already with the distinctive cut-away spouts so
41 popular in the next millennium, and some imitating birds; one, from a
neighbouring cemetery, is shaped like an owl-a bird frequently connected
with funerary rites.

Hi 22.1 cm.
In the last chapter we saw how the depiction of the human body
developed from the stylisation of prehistoric limes to the realism of the Uruk
period. This realism continued into the third millennium, but the emphasis
changed. Whereas the prehistoric figurines were probably connected with
fertility and were thought to be endowed with magical properties, the
statues of the Early Dynastic period in Mesopotamia seem to have depicted
the worshippers - both men and women - who set them up in temples so that
they would be permanently represented before the deity. They stand with 42
hands clasped and huge eyes focused sightlessly on the object of worship;
sometimes an inscription on the shoulder provides information as to the
name of the worshipper and his or her deity. These statues have been found
in temple ruins and in caches where consecrated furnishings and votive
objects were discarded and buried when a temple was redecorated or
rebuilt. The few metal figures which have survived testify to the skill of the
copper-, silver- and goldsmiths, but generally old metal furnishings would
be melted down and used for making new ones.
One hoard of statues from Tell Asmar in the Diyala region, dating around 43
60



Temple, Cemetery and Palace: the 3rd millennium BC
2700 bc, has become famous. Mary Chubb, who was present when the
hoard was discovered, describes the scene as follows:
Seton [Lloyd] and Hans [Frankfort] were alone in the Abu Temple
when I reached it. They were crouching in front of the niche beside the
altar, and a fresh pile of rubble lay round them on the clean floor. . . .
Down in the floor of the niche was a long, oblong cavity - and in it I
could see a gleaming, tightly packed mass of white and cream and grey
and yellow stone statues; here a strange eye stared up, there a hand,
long fingers curled round a cup, seemed to tremble with life. Most
were over a foot in length. Many of them were broken, though all the
pieces were in place;... it looked as though they had been complete
when buried, but that the weight of the numerous rebuildings of the
Temple above must have cracked and crushed them. More statues
came up, men and women, the men in fringed and tasselled kilts, the
women with long cloaks thrown over one shoulder, leaving the other
bare. All had their hands clasped before them, some holding cups.
‘They are worshippers, of course,’ Hans said. (M. Chubb, City in the
Sand, London 1957, p. 139 f.)
43 Votive statues from Tell Asmar, all but one with huge inlaid eyes and eyebrows, and small mouths. The eight standing men are broadshouldered, with narrow waists; they wear belts and fringed skirts and have pointed elbows and small hands; one is clean-shaven but the others have shoulder-length hair and beards indicated by ridges or zigzags. One bearded man is kneeling, naked except for a belt and hat. The two women wear edged robes: the smaller has plaited hair; the larger, who has one small breast uncovered, originally had a child beside her, inserted separately into the base. About 2700 bc. Ht of tallest figure 72 cm (Iraq Museum, Baghdad, and Oriental Institute, Chicago).

44 Two examples of the greater realism and more compact forms of the votive figures of about 2500 bc. These are less stereotyped and give the impression of being portraits. Left A female worshipper, whose eyes were originally inlaid and whose hair hangs in a long plait at the back. Note that unlike the earlier statues in Fig. 43, the legs have not been carved in the round. Right Kurlil, an official, seated with hands clasped. Respectively from Tello (ancient Girsu) and Tell aPUbaid in southern Iraq. Ht 30 cm, 37.5 cm.
Later, Frankfort revised his opinion and thought that the two tallest figures
were deities, but they too are probably worshippers. They have huge eyes
inlaid with lapis lazuli or shell set in bitumen. The eyebrows, also originally
inlaid, meet over the nose as in the Brak and Warka heads (Figs 28 and 32).
The underlying geometry is clearly apparent, with wedge-shaped torsos,
cone-shaped skirts and cylindrical legs. The figures vary not only in size but
in quality of carving, presumably reflecting the taste and fortune of those
who commissioned the sculptures. (A parallel case can be seen among the
votive plaques in the Oxus Treasure, where taste and money certainly did 147
not go hand in hand.) The figure of a kneeling, naked man shows real
originality, but most are stereotyped. Nevertheless, they have a monumen
tal quality, so that it always comes as a shock to see how relatively small they
actually are. Similar or related figures have been found as far afield as Tell
Chuera in northern Syria and Shahdad in south-eastern Iran.
The Sumerians were unaccustomed to working in stone, which was not
available locally and had to be imported. The Egyptians had discovered the
difficulty of depicting three-dimensional standing figures without the bene
fit of a dorsal pillar, but only one figure in the Tell Asmar hoard has such a
pillar, and almost all the other figures, despite their thick legs, are broken at
62



Temple, Cemetery and Palace: the 3rd millennium bc
the ankles. The Sumerians were subject to the restrictions imposed by the
sizes and shapes of stone which were easiest to transport from the mountains
by donkey caravan. It has been suggested that this was the reason for the
fairly small, slab-like shape of Sumerian sculpture as opposed to the cube
shapes of Egyptian sculptures, for which the stone was transported by ship.
A fragmentary figure of this period in the British Museum has not been
improved by the loss of its nose, which was attached separately, presumably
because the block of stone from which the figure was cut was not thick
enough to accommodate it (wa 91667). The shape of the blocks of stone
which reached Mesopotamia continued to dictate the shape of the sculptures
44/. throughout their history. The serene female worshipper from Lagash, who
stands smiling, with hands clasped before the deity, barely emerges from
the block of stone from which she was cut; the same is true of the statue of
44r. Kurlil which was found at the site of al-‘Ubaid. They resemble in shape the
later Babylonian kudurrus. Free-standing figures generally remained strictly
112 frontal and the statue of the ninth-century Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II
still reflects these constraints.
The representation of worshippers undergoes some development during
the Early Dynastic period. By about 2500 bc they are generally shaven
45 headed and beardless, and their garments are tufted all over, probably to
represent the fleece of the sheep- or goat-skins from which they were made.
By then the trade route along the Euphrates was functioning again and many
votive statues of this type have been found at the site of Mari, on the
Euphrates in Syria, which has been excavated by the French. Similar figures
were also depicted in relief.
An inscription tells us that Kurlil was responsible for building work on a
temple dedicated to the Sumerian fertility goddess Ninhursag. His statue
was excavated beside the ruins of the temple, built on a platform within an
oval enclosure around 2500 bc at al-‘Ubaid in southern Iraq (the same site
gave its name to the prehistoric painted pottery described in Chapter 1).
Many of the temple furnishings were recovered where they had fallen or
been stacked in the angle between the stairway to the shrine and the
platform. The temple entrance was guarded by bitumen lions covered with
copper, with inlaid eyes and tongues. It was flanked by columns, inlaid with
triangles of mother-of-pearl and red limestone set in black bitumen, imitat
ing palm trunks and recalling the clay-cone mosaic columns from Uruk over
half a millennium earlier. There were also copper and limestone friezes of
birds and a milking scene, reclining copper calves and standing copper bulls
in fields of enormous stylised flowers made of coloured stones. But the most
46 striking element of the facade decoration was the huge copper frieze which
probably originally stood above the door. The survival of such large-scale
copper artefacts is most unusual and presents a tantalising glimpse of what
once existed.

However, the greatest revelation was provided by the so-called Royal
Cemetery of Ur, excavated by Leonard Woolley from 1926 onwards. The
cemetery was dug outside the walls of the city but about 2,000 years later the
walls of Nebuchadnezzar’s larger city were built over it. Here some 1,840
burials were found, dating to between 2600 and 2000 bc, with the earliest
burials by far the most numerous. The types of interment varied from
simple inhumations, with the body merely rolled in a mat, to elaborate
burials in domed tombs reached by descending ramps. Seventeen of these
early burials Woolley called ‘Royal Graves’ because there was evidence that
there had been a built tomb and that the dead were accompanied by
extraordinarily rich grave-goods and by the bodies of sacrificed retainers.
Various theories have been advanced as to the identity of the main occupant
of each tomb. Some were men and some women; some of them we know by
name because of the inscriptions on seals buried with them, but it is not
known whether they were kings and queens or priests and priestesses. The
buried retainers included soldiers, male and female attendants and musi
cians, and one burial, in what is called the Great Death Pit, was accom
panied by seventy-four bodies - six men and sixty-eight women - who had,
it seems, been given a drug and had then lain down in orderly rows. So far,
the only written evidence for the practice of human sacrifice in Mesopotamia
is a Sumerian text recounting the ‘Death of Gilgamesh’ which refers to the
hero-king of Uruk being accompanied to the Nether World by ‘his wives,
children, musicians, chief valet, and attendants’. Two of the richest burials
were built one behind the other, with the access ramp of the later tomb, that
of the ‘Queen’ Pu-abi, passing over the earlier one from which the body of
64



Temple, Cemetery and Palace: the 3rd millennium bc
the main occupant - referred to as the ‘King’ but not known by name - was
missing, although the reasons for this were not clear. It has been suggested
that the body may have been removed to symbolise the king’s return from
the Nether World - a re-enactment of the Sumerian myth of Tammuz - but
this is not generally accepted.
The tombs contained such rich grave-goods that it is impossible to do
them justice here, even if we confine ourselves to those which were part of
48 the British Museum’s share. Weapons and vessels of gold, silver and
electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) were in abundance. These materials
47 were combined with shell, coloured limestone and lapis lazuli, set in
bitumen on a wooden frame, to make a series of remarkable mosaic panels
49 and three-dimensional objects. Woolley’s workmen had been told to alert
him whenever they came upon an area which sounded hollow. These
hollows were then filled with wax or plaster which was allowed to set and
Woolley was able to recover a cast of the wooden objects which had perished
50 over the millennia. In this way the ‘Royal Standard of Ur’ itself was
excavated.
This intriguing object, of uncertain purpose, is a fine example of narrative
art. The action develops from bottom to top, and from left to right on the two
lower registers and from right to left in the uppermost, towards the main
figure, probably the ruler, who is taller than the rest (a convention known as
social perspective) and whose head overlaps the frame (cf. Fig. 46). On the
War side, four large chariots are advancing, three of them driving over fallen
enemies. They have four intricately constructed solid wheels (spoked
wheels did not appear till about 1800 bc). There are two men in each chariot
- a driver and a spearman who stands on a running-board at the back; spare
spears are shown at an angle at the front. This cumbersome vehicle is drawn
by two onagers (wild asses); reins run through nose-rings (the bit is
first attested a millennium later) and through rein-rings on the yoke-pole.
A similar rein-ring of silver, ornamented with an electrum onager
(wa 121348), was found in Pu-abi’s tomb. The chariots cannot have been
very effective in warfare because they were heavy and the harness went
round the necks of the onagers (instead of across the shoulders) so that the
animals would have been throttled had they drawn the chariots at any speed
or for any distance. In the middle register the infantry are wearing leather
cloaks, and helmets (actual copper examples were found, worn by soldiers
buried in the ‘King’s’ tomb). They are preceded by other soldiers guarding
prisoners. The procession continues onto the top register where the pris
oners are escorted towards a robed figure - the focus of the scene - and his
entourage; behind him is the chariot from which he has just alighted.
On the Peace side, at the bottom, there are figures heavily laden with
booty, and onagers. In the middle register, figures escort the animals
required for the feast, most of them probably also booty: goats, cattle, fish,
47 1'he motif of pairs of goals browsing in a tree, often on a hill, was common in Near Eastern art at most periods.

By allowing the eagle's leonine head and the antlers to break out of the confines of the frame, the unknown artist has devised a way of showing that the eagle’s power is not restricted by the framework in which it has been ‘captured’; this artistic device has been reinvented by generations of artists since.

still the basis of the strip cartoons of the present day. The static framework
serves as a counterpoint to the movement of the scenes within; sometimes,
in the case of the representation of dynamic activities, it helps to emphasise
them.
One of the musicians on the Royal Standard carries a lyre, the sound-box
of which is decorated with a bull’s head. Thanks to Woolley’s careful
excavation, actual musical instruments of this type were recovered. Two of 53
these instruments had been found in the tomb of Pu-abi but they lay so close
to each other that it was thought that they formed a single instrument, and
this is how they were restored. Now the two have been separated and shown
to be a boat-shaped harp and a portable or table lyre with a bull’s head above
a panel decorated with inlay (see Fig. 192 for the panel from a similar lyre).
The bull may have been used to indicate the pitch of the lyre and was still
being carved on the yoke of Egyptian lyres more than 2,000 years later.
The skill of the craftsmen entrusted with the inlay of objects in the Royal
Cemetery was not restricted to prestige ‘standards’ and musical instru
ments. Several gaming-boards were found with designs of rosettes, paired
eyes and patterns of five dots on the twenty squares making up the game
(e.g. wa 120834). This ‘Game of Twenty Squares’ was played all over the
Near East for millennia; after the fall of Babylon in 539 bc Jewish refugees
may have carried it to India, where it was still being played by members of a
Jewish community in Cochin a few years ago. A gaming-board of about the
same date as the Ur board has been found at Shahr-i Sokhta in eastern Iran.
Another link between the Ur game and the east is provided by an enigmatic
object resembling a stone handbag, also found at Ur; it may be a weight from 54
eastern Iran or Afghanistan, and it is decorated with similar rosettes and
eyes.
Not all inlaid objects from Ur were successful, however, and a series of
ostrich eggs decorated with inlaid rims and feet are particularly unpleasant 54
examples of kitsch. However, they demonstrate the search for the exotic
which is better illustrated by vessels made from imported stones and found
in a variety of attractive shapes. Whereas some of these vessels were made at
Ur, others were imported ready-made. Small straight-sided vessels with
relief design must have originated in south-central Iran, where a source of
chlorite was exploited by the inhabitants of the site of Tepe Yahya. Another
vessel from Iran, or perhaps from further east, was found at Khafajeh and 51
was for a number of years thought to be a Sumerian product. It is the same
shape as most of the other chlorite vessels but bears a figurative design which
is presumably linked to a local mythology. The composition is well bal
anced: the kneeling figure holds the ‘tails’ of the streams of water and
controls the fertility of the land, while his more dynamic counterpart grasps
the necks of the snakes and controls the destructive forces of nature.
However, the balance emphasises the deliberate contrasts: for instance, the
68



Temple, Cemetery and Palace: the 3rd millennium BC
lack of concern of the feeding zebu on the one hand and the way the snakes
and felines look at the standing man on the other. The final scene may show
the chaos which ensues when men or gods are not in control. Fragments of a
similar vessel (wa i 16455) found at Ur probably depicted another version of
this scene, and the horn on the head of the only surviving figure may, as we
shall see, identify him as a deity. However, the figures on the Khafajeh
vessel may be royal heroes, for a similar hairstyle is worn by the man on a
52 lapis lazuli seal from eastern Iran where he is clearly taking part in a
banquet. Zebus are not native to Mesopotamia and their presence on the
Khafajeh vessel and on the seal, and the way their horns are depicted as if
seen from above (rather than in profile, as is the convention in Meso
potamia: see, for example, Fig. 35a), indicates a connection with the
civilisation which was developing along the Indus Valley in Pakistan and
north-west India. There was to be increasing evidence for such contacts
during the next few centuries.
55 The jewellery from Ur provides other evidence for contacts with the east.
The lapis lazuli was, as we have seen, imported from Afghanistan. Some of

Though made in Iran or further east, the vessel was found at Khafajeh, north-east of Baghdad. A man in a net skirl (cf. Fig. 35a) kneels on two zebus standing back to back, and grasps streams watering vegetation and a palm-tree; above are two undulating lines (rain clouds?), a crescent moon and a rosette sun. A similar figure, with a rosette but without the side plaits, grasps two snakes and stands between two felines lying back to back, with heads turned towards him.

the beads may have been imported ready-made, some may have been made
at sites such as Shahr-i Sokhta in eastern Iran, and some were probably
fashioned at Ur. There are discoid, annular, double conoid, leaf-shaped,
melon-shaped, segmented, round, barrel-shaped, faceted, cylindrical, tra
pezoidal and many other types of beads in a variety of sizes, and most also
occur in gold versions. Chokers were built up of alternating lapis lazuli and
gold trapezoidal multiple beads. The carnelian beads are mostly round or
double conoids, but some are flat. Sometimes the carnelian has been etched
with an alkali to leave a white pattern - a technique which probably
originated on the west coast of India; this area is also a plausible source for
the carnelian and the few agate beads.
Many techniques were employed in the making of the jewellery.

example of the technique. Filigree was used on a little holder for gold
tweezers, scoop and applicator (Iraq Museum, Baghdad). Although it has
been claimed that granulation was used at Ur, it does not seem that true
granulation occurs, although small gold balls were fused together to form
beads. True granulation, whereby minute balls of gold were attached to a
backing of gold, probably first appeared around 1800 bc. Gold rosettes are
made of narrow strips of gold looped backwards and forwards between gold
rings. A gold stud has its head incised to form linked spirals, and the chain
on a head ornament is executed with the double loop-in-loop links still
found in much Victorian jewellery. Small animals and fish were made of
gold leaf over a bitumen core, and of different stones. All this jewellery was
combined in headdresses which are works of art in themselves and which
were topped by huge pins cut from sheets of silver to form stems ending in
rosettes of inlaid stones which quivered as the wearer moved. They were
worn with strings of beads and chokers, and huge, boat-shaped earrings
made of sheet gold. It has been possible to reconstruct these headdresses and
necklaces because they were excavated where they lay on the skeletons of
those who had worn them. The garments were secured with toggle pins, and
from these hung strings of beads and often a cylinder seal.
Cylinder seals were found in many of the Ur graves. A large number were
made of lapis lazuli - among them Pu-abi’s own depicting a banquet, which 56c
was a popular motif. A further seal from the Royal Cemetery shows the 56b
other main theme for cylinder seals at this time, the contest scene. The
crossed bodies of animals on this seal create an intricate pattern of relation
ships within the composition; they are characteristic of this period and
survive into the succeeding Akkadian period, as do the lions’ heads seen
from above; the long manes are also distinctive and are lacking on earlier
versions of the contest scene. One of these earlier scenes depicts a figure 56a
traditionally known as the nude hero together with a bull-man. The upper
part of a bull-man’s body is human, but with the horns and ears of a bull;
from the waist down his body is that of a bull. These two, both generally
shown frontally, form a popular motif on later seals. Lions also appear on
this seal, but whereas the head of one of the lions is shown in profile, those of
the other two are seen from above; they are smaller and more pinched and
their manes, with patterns of arcs confined within narrow outlines, lack the
exuberance of those on the later seal. The composition is clearer, with none
of the crossing over found later; it is also more static. Perhaps a century
separates these seals; both are masterpieces of composition and execution,
but the aims of the seal-cutters were different.
During the Early Dynastic period there was a growing emphasis on the
individual. Seals began to be cut with inscriptions identifying the owner and
giving his titles and profession. Rulers achieved greater status in the secular
realm and gradually the palace and temple became separate institutions,

each with its own hierarchy and administration. Sumer and probably most
of Mesopotamia, Syria and perhaps Iran, were divided into a series of city
states which were often at odds with each other. The fortunes of a city were
those of its patron deity and it became necessary to identify these various
deities. For this purpose the horned headdress was developed some time
around 2500 bc or shortly after.
An early depiction of a god appears on a limestone plaque from Ur which,
judging by its shape and the hole in the centre, was originally set up in a
73



Ancient Near Eastern Art
57 Limestone plaque from Ur (c. 2500-2400 bc). The design is divided into two registers. Above, three women follow a naked, beardless priest with abundant hair who pours a libation on an altar before a bearded and robed god in a horned headdress. Below, a man and a woman carrying animal offerings (perhaps the donors of the plaque) and a woman shown frontally stand behind a shaven headed beardless naked priest who pours a libation before a building which has the niches and buttresses typical of Mesopotamian temple architecture, with gateposts on either side.

temple; it was found in a religious institution, the Gipar-ku. The identity of
the god is not clear: he holds a pot of a type which was often an attribute of
the water-god Ea in later iconography (a similar vessel was found in the
tomb of Pu-abi), but the gate-posts on either side of the temple facade are
sometimes thought to be symbols of the goddess Inanna. However, the
women on the plaque may provide a further clue as to the god’s identity. All
but one are probably priestesses and they wear their hair in a distinctive style
which is later that of the En-priestess of the moon god at Ur, an important
post usually filled by the ruler’s daughter. If the En-priestess is to be
identified on the Ur relief, then she is probably the figure shown frontally on
the lower register, whose hair is indicated in greater detail. Libation vessels
of the type the priests hold have been found in the Royal Cemetery (e.g.
wa 121450); the vessel could be grasped by the foot or the neck and did not
have a handle, indicating that the contents were not hot. Handles are
relatively rare on Mesopotamian vessels and are much more common on
those of Iran (at certain periods), Turkey, Syria and Palestine, presumably
because hot liquids were more often being poured in these areas.
In connection with this plaque, the convention used for depicting figures
in relief should perhaps be discussed. The head is generally shown in
profile, the torso is frontal and the legs are in profile. This twisted posture
avoids the problems presented by a frontal depiction of the face or feet: the
74

58 Stele set up by the Akkadian king Naram-Sin (r. 2254-2218 bc) to commemorate his conquest of the Lullubi in the Zagros mountains on the borders between Iraq and Iran. The king stands on a mountain pass between astral symbols, wearing the divine horned helmet; his fringed garment, knotted over one hip, became for centuries that of the warrior king (see Fig. 82b). He holds a bow and arrow and towers over dead and wounded Lullubians, some with broken weapons in a row along the right edge of the stele. Akkadian soldiers with spears and standards climb the wooded slopes. Hl 2 m (Paris, Louvre).

Ancient Near Eastern Art
nose, for instance, would either have to jut out beyond the rest of the relief,
thus necessitating the removal of large quantities of stone and leaving it
vulnerable to breakage, or it would appear foreshortened and squashed.
The figure of the principal priestess on the Ur plaque demonstrates this.
However, although this twisted profile was the normal way of represent
ing two-dimensional figures and figures in low relief throughout the Near
East and also in Egypt until the final years of the Assyrian empire, there
were certain exceptions. Some of these we have already seen. The nude
hero, the bull-man and the human-headed bull are almost always shown
full-face at all periods, and for at least a thousand years this was also the case
for the goddess Inanna/Ishtar (see Figs 59c and 82a). In Babylonian
iconography between about 1850 and 1750 bc, a nude female figure and a
goddess whose iconography may have derived from the representation of
the priestess on the Ur plaque were also shown frontally (Fig. 82a and
compare Figs 57 and 82c). It is not clear why an exception to the rule should
have been made in these cases, and why this convention should have
survived the millennia. Perhaps there was some particular significance in
the depiction of both eyes in these specific cases.
From about 2334 bc the separate city-states were united under a king
called Sargon, who established his capital at Akkad. The site of this city has
not been located but may lie buried beneath one of the mounds which were
later to become part of Babylon. There may have been economic reasons for
the shift of power northwards. Intensive irrigation results in considerable
evaporation and increased salination; records show that during the latter
part of the third millennium the wheat yield decreased and salt-resistant
crops had to be planted instead. Some sites were abandoned, and without
regular maintenance some canals silted up, leading to the enforced abandon
ment of further sites. There may also have been a political reason for the shift
northwards: Sargon was not a Sumerian but a Semite. The language he
spoke, Akkadian, belonged to the Semitic language-group of which Arabic
and Hebrew are modern descendants. Doubtless Sargon did not wish to
associate himself too closely with one of the old Sumerian city-states. Akkad
was also more centrally located and Sargon had imperial ambitions for his
dynasty which reached their apogee under his grandson Naram-Sin
(r. 2254-2218 bc), who set up stelae recording his conquests. Akkadian
power extended up the Tigris into Assyria and up the Euphrates into Syria,
and perhaps even into Turkey where, according to tradition, there were
Akkadian trading colonies. One of the most enduring icons for victory ever
devised commemorated Naram-Sin’s victory against the Lullubi in the 58
Zagros mountains of eastern Mesopotamia. It is also the earliest datable
Mesopotamian landscape.
That stele had a tremendous impact on the tribal rulers of the Zagros who,
during the next few centuries, cut rock reliefs on the cliffs along the main
76



Temple, Cemetery and Palace: the 3rd millennium BC
route between Mesopotamia and Iran. Here they still stand triumphant over
their enemies. Much later still, Darius the Great (r. 521-486 bc) chose the
site of Bisitun, further along the same road, for his huge victory relief and
its trilingual inscription which led to the decipherment of cuneiform (see
page 24).
The Naram-Sin stele had an interesting subsequent history. It was still
standing in Sippar when, around 1157 bc, the Elamites brought about the
fall of the Kassite dynasty and carried it off, together with other works of art
which they set up in Susa as booty (an inscription on the mountain cone
beside Naram-Sin informs us of this event). There, in 1898, it was excavated
by the French; it is now in the Louvre in Paris (see page 120).
Sargon must have been an extraordinary person: certainly his achieve
ments were remembered for millennia and legends grew up around the
circumstances of his birth (he was said to have been found as a baby, floating
on the Euphrates in a basket - a much earlier version of the events
accompanying the birth of Moses in the Bible). His name means ‘true king’
and was borne by other great kings whose origins were equally doubtful, the
greatest being Sargon II of Assyria (r. 721-705 bc). In the context of this
study Sargon of Akkad is chiefly remarkable for having established an
imperial style in art.
The Akkadian empire lasted less than a century and a half, and as the
capital city has not been located, and Akkadian cities in the vicinity are
probably buried under alluvium and a high water-table, its innovative art
and architecture are mostly known from outlying cities and colonies,
notably Tell Brak in north Syria. In their homeland, therefore, the art of the
59 Akkadians is best documented by their seals, which have survived in great
numbers. The reason for their survival lies in their large size, the beautiful
stones from which they were often made and the exceptional quality of the
carving, which meant that they were frequently kept in circulation and
reused by later owners (see page 19). The size of the seals meant that they
were less easy to use and were probably carried as status symbols; indeed,
very few impressions of Akkadian seals have survived. There may have been
an official policy of making seals a vehicle for the new imperial style, and
certainly Akkadian seals are easily distinguishable from those of the preced
ing Early Dynastic period.
59a Contest scenes continued to be popular, but the Akkadian craftsmen
returned to the clearer forms of the earlier Early Dynastic II style and
generally avoided the crossed animals of the later Early Dynastic III style.
The participants are the same: the predator is a lion with its head generally
seen from above (the leopard disappears from the repertory); bulls, sheep,
goats and human-headed bulls are in need of the protection provided by
bearded heroes, naked but for a triple belt, depicted full-face, generally with
triple curls on either side, or by bearded, kilted ‘royal heroes’ shown in

profile wearing decorated hats, and by bull-men, who are generally, and
increasingly, shown full-face. The power of the design no longer resides in
its dynamic composition but in its static, balanced monumentality.
By the middle of the next century, these Akkadian characteristics had 59b
evolved into a classic style with two pairs of contestants and an inscription
panel. The continuous and repeating frieze was replaced by a design w’hich
can be viewed either with the pairs framing the inscription or with the

78



Temple, Cemetery and Palace: the 3rd millennium BC
inscription panel framing the contestants, thus creating a heraldic balance.
Many of these later Akkadian seals are concave-sided and made of green
stone, a very popular material used almost exclusively at this period.
Another characteristic feature of Akkadian seals is the way in which the
59c elbows of the contestants point upwards. Sometimes the heraldic balance is
carried still further and one workshop, probably a royal one, specialised in
identical pairs of contestants whose contorted postures are executed in
mirror-image. On the example illustrated here, the patterning of the stone
makes it difficult to see the design unless the seal is rolled out. Nevertheless,
despite the hard stone and the small scale of the carving, the unknown artist
has even managed to differentiate between the front and back of the lions’
paws.
A fine seal in the Louvre, probably a product of the same workshop,
shows, also in mirror-image, two nude heroes kneeling to offer vases of
water to two water-buffaloes; the inscription names the owner, a scribe of
King Shar-kali-sharri (r. 2217-2193 bc). It is probable that water-buffaloes
were imported from the Indus Valley at this period and kept in a royal zoo;
they generally appear on high-quality seals which often belong to royal
officials. Full advantage was taken of the decorative possibilities provided
59b by the curve of the huge horns of these animals, but the way these horns are
depicted as seen from above is but a bolder version of the way they were
depicted in their homeland. Seals provide the best evidence for links with
the east: there is even an Akkadian seal (Louvre) belonging to a Meluhhan
interpreter, and it is probable that, at this time, Meluhha was the name for
the Indus Valley area. A cylinder seal carved with Indian animals (elephant,
rhinoceros and crocodile), depicted in Indus style, was excavated at Tell
Asmar in the Diyala region (Iraq Museum, Baghdad). There is evidence
that Sargon of Akkad either instigated these links, or at least actively
encouraged them, for the seal impression of his daughter’s scribe, found at
Ur, already depicts a water-buffalo. This daughter, En-hedu-anna, was
installed as En-priestess of the moon god at Ur.
Sargon also seems to have been responsible for a reorganisation of the
pantheon. The Sumerian deities were mostly associated with fertility and
animal husbandry but the Akkadian deities were predominantly astral,
representing sun, moon and stars. In order to unite the country, and in an
attempt at breaking the close connection between gods and goddesses and
their cities (which does not seem to have been altogether successful),
Sumerian and Akkadian deities were combined and a standard iconography
59e devised so that they could easily be identified visually. The fine seal of Adda
illustrates the process. The deities all wear the horned headdress which
indicates their status, and here the iconographic principles which were to
govern the representation of the main deities are clearly formulated for the
first time. Below the inscription panel is a lion, the attribute of a hunting god

whose precise identity is not known and who is shown full-face, holding his
composite bow and an arrow, with his quiver on his back, below which
hangs a tassel for cleaning his arrows; he is ready for action with the front of
his skirt tucked into his belt. The Sumerian goddess of fertility, Inanna, was
combined with Ishtar, the Semitic warrior-goddess associated with the
planet Venus, and the attributes connected with these three aspects are
represented by a bunch of dates held by the small goddess, the weapons
rising from her shoulders, and her wings. The sun god Utu/Shamash, god of
justice and omens, with rays rising from his shoulder, cuts his way through
the mountains of the east (represented by a scale pattern) with his saw
toothed knife. The water god Ea or Enki has no clear Semitic equivalent and
lost popularity after the Akkadian period, but here he is given prominence
as the god of the subterranean waters, the god of wisdom and craftsmen
(including scribes); he is identified by a bull, by the streams of water flowing
from his shoulders with fish swimming up them, by his two-faced attendant
Usimu, who stands behind him, and by the presence of the Zu-bird who
stole the Tablet of Destinies (see also Fig. 194a).
Another scribe, Kalki, chose a purely secular theme for his seal’s design. 59d
He is shown shaven-headed, holding a tablet and standing behind his
master, the prince Ubil-Ishtar. The latter is probably the figure in a hat,
with his hair in a double bun, wearing a fleecy robe and carrying an axe, who
stands at the centre of the composition with everyone else looking towards
him. On either side are two officials in fleecy robes carrying weapons. The
party advances towards the left, preceded by a figure - perhaps a mountain
guide - who wears a distinctive hairstyle, a kilt and the boots with upturned
toes normally worn by foreigners from mountainous areas of Turkey and
Iran; he carries a composite bow, an arrow and a quiver with a tassel hanging
below it. Behind come two servants carrying the furniture and belongings of
the party. It is tempting to see in the scene the highlight of Kalki’s career,
when he accompanied a royal diplomatic or trading mission and brought
back, possibly from south-western Iran, the rare stone from which his seal
was carved.
Many seals show mythological themes. One particularly popular subject 59f
was the legend of Etana, who was a shepherd and appears on king-lists as
king of Kish. According to the legend, the eagle had betrayed the serpent’s
trust and stolen its young (in the version depicted on the seal it seems that a
lion replaced the serpent). As a result its wings were broken and it was
imprisoned. Etana rescued the eagle, which agreed to carry him up to
heaven so that he could ask the gods for a son. Etana fell once but the eagle
swooped down and caught him, and the text breaks off as he falls again;
presumably, however, he achieved his goal, for according to the king-list he
was succeeded by his son. Other seals show the ‘Battle of the Gods’; this 59g
popular scene may well have been connected with the agricultural cycle.

Temple, Cemetery and Palace: the 3rd millennium BC
The banquet scene which had been so popular in the Early Dynastic
period was replaced in Akkadian times by presentation scenes before seated
59g deities. Some Akkadian presentation scenes show a worshipper and groups
of standing deities; this grouping of standing figures was revived in the next
82 millennium, but the seated presentation scene became almost the only
60 subject for seals during the last century of the third millennium.
The Akkadian empire probably collapsed under pressure of Gutian
invaders from the east, although a change in climate and resulting economic
instability have also been suggested as a cause for the wane of Akkadian
power. After a period of chaos there was a Sumerian revival in the south,
with dynasties at Lagash and Ur. Finally the Third Dynasty of Ur gained the
upper hand under its founder, Ur-Nammu (r. 2112-2095 BC), although it
was the reorganisation of the administration under Shulgi (r. 2094-2047 bc)
which heralded a brief period of expansion before the collapse of the dynasty
in about 2004 bc.
60a A spectacular seal is dated by its inscription to the reign of Ur-Nammu. It
shows two goddesses, one of whom is leading the owner of the seal by the
hand in a way that is distinctive of this period, while the other stands with
both hands raised in the posture which was to become almost universal for
60b interceding goddesses in the second millennium. On later official seals the
king holds a cup which symbolises the office he is conferring on his servant;
he is seated on a distinctive fleece-covered stool, and the crescent moon is
generally replaced by a combined symbol with the sun-disc, inscribed with a
star, within the arc of the crescent. A long inscription, divided into two
panels one above the other, is also typical of the period. Sometimes a deity

seats; the rules apply as much to these court seals as to the smaller, cruder
seals of private individuals, with brief, two-line inscriptions, where the
worshipper is generally led by a goddess in a vertically striped robe before
another goddess, who is seated. The direction of the scenes also becomes
established, with the deity or king who is the focus of the scene sitting or
standing on the right, facing left, when viewed on the impression. This was
to be the normal direction for all types of scene, regardless of medium, in
Mesopotamia and beyond, throughout the remainder of the period covered
by this book.
The strict adherence to conventions apparent in the art of the Third
Dynasty of Ur is evidence of the establishment of an official canon. This
contrasts with the imperial style of the Akkadian period, which is no less
distinctive but which allowed the artist the freedom to express himself and to
be innovative. Whereas the art of the Akkadian period had been new and
exciting, and had mirrored the vigorous and expansionist vision of its
leaders, the Ur III canon was a reflection of the restrictions of a bureaucratic
administration. The one was looked upon as a golden, heroic age and
influenced the art of later periods; the other was the swan-song of the
Sumerians.
Ur-Nammu was responsible for considerable building activity at Ur,
including the first ziggurat, or stepped temple-tower, which still dominates
the landscape. He also undertook building activity elsewhere, as is testified
by a foundation figure from a temple at Uruk. Here the king shows himself, 61
not as a ruler freeing his land from predators, but as a priest carrying the
building materials for his god’s temple. This continued to be an aspect of the
role of kings, and similar figures were buried in the foundations of buildings
for over three centuries: the British Museum has examples, e.g. WA 102462,
inscribed with the name of Rim-Sin, the last king of the Larsa dynasty
(r. 1822-1763 bc). The seventh-century bc Assyrian king Ashurbanipal not
only had himself depicted in lion hunts but also in the role of royal builder
(e.g. wa 90864) - a reflection of his interest in continuing (or reviving)
ancient traditions.
Probably in part contemporary with Ur-Nammu was Gudea, ruler of
Lagash. A foundation figurine from one of his cities, Girsu, shows a 63
kneeling god holding a peg (wa 102613), while another peg is topped by the
figure of a bull browsing in a reed marsh. However, Gudea is chiefly famous
for a remarkable series of statues of himself (most of them in the Louvre) 62
which he set up in the temples of his city and its vicinity. The finish of these
statues, most of which are carved in hard diorite, testifies to the increased

technical skill of the craftsmen. As in the Early Dynastic period, the sculptor

are marked with herring-bone incisions. A huge, fragmentary statue of
Gudea, or one of his near contemporaries (wa 98069), must have been at
least twice life-size; it shows that, at this period, the size of the imported
blocks of stone no longer restricted Sumerian sculptors.
Smaller statues of the last centurv of the second millennium also show
worshippers. Women had elaborate hairstyles, as demonstrated by the head 64
of a female worshipper from Ur ( wa i i 8564) and by a stone hair-piece- part 65
of a composite statue - which is dated by its inscription to the reign of King
Shulgi. The statues of worshippers were set up in the sanctuaries of temples,
but there is little evidence of what the statues of gods and goddesses were
like. They were probably made of metal or wood, covered and inlaid with
precious materials, and have not survived. One exception, from Ashur in
northern Mesopotamia, is a plaster plaque, now broken, depicting a naked
goddess who was originally about 20 centimetres tall, standing frontally in a
decorated niche (wa 118996). Iler features were dominated by her huge
eyes, but they have been considerably abraded; she is square-shouldered
and stands with her thin arms stiffly alongside her body; her round breasts
are close together and the beginning of her pubic triangle can be seen above
the break. Black and red painted decoration adorns her body: round her

she has feather-like patterns over her shoulders. There is something very
primitive about this cult figure when it is seen alongside the sophistication of
the contemporary Akkadian seals discussed above, or the slightly later
statues of Gudea.
So far this chapter has dealt mainly with the art of Mesopotamia. This is
because, during the third millennium BC, the culture of Mesopotamia was
predominantly an urban one; its large town sites are easy to identify and
have been extensively excavated. Elsewhere in the Near East the cultures
were more rural. The few exceptions mostly lacked the richness of their
Mesopotamian counterparts, being local market-towns where products
from surrounding villages were bought and sold, many of these products
with the notable exception of pottery - being made of perishable or recycled
materials. The artistic creations that have lasted have come from inter
national emporia. Furthermore, town sites of this period in Iran, Turkey,
Syria and Palestine have either been excavated by non-British archaeologists
or have been dug since the introduction of laws restricting the export of
antiquities, and so are poorly represented in the British Museum’s collec
tions.
The fact that metal objects are so often melted down and reused has
already been mentioned; most of those that have survived have been found
in graves. Among these are animal-shaped standards such as those from
66 Kirkuk, which may have decorated a canopy above a burial. Similar
67 standards and others with geometric patterns, a considerable amount of
jewellery, gold vessels and a distinctive type of dagger with a crescentic hilt
were found in graves of about 2300 bc at Alaca Hiiyuk in central Turkey
(now mostly in the Museum of Anatolian Civilisations in Ankara); much of

this material has parallels at Ur in the Royal Cemetery, showing that
traditions of fine craftsmanship in gold take little account of geographical
and chronological boundaries (see also the ‘Median’ jewellery hoard from
Tepe Nush-i Jan, page 177). A silver two-handled cup (wa 132150) of
similar date, from near Troy in western Turkey, displays the same clean
68 lines as the bull standard. Ceremonial axes have also frequently been found
in burials of the late third millennium BC and demonstrate the excellence of
metalworking techniques at this time. They appear as a status symbol on the
59d contemporary Akkadian seal discussed above.

The two principal vehicles for artistic expression in prehistoric times
namely painted pottery and figurines - are still to be found at this period in
69 less urbanised areas. A stylised rendering of animals is painted in dark
70-1 brown on globular jars of buff clay from Tepe Giyan in western Iran around
2000 bc, and in Turkey, Syria and northern Iraq a number of figurines carry
on the traditions of earlier times and illustrate several regional variations.
A less stylised version of the female body appears on stone moulds used
for casting lead figurines which can be dated around 2000 BC. Most come
from central Anatolia but one was found at Sippar near Baghdad, where it
would have arrived as an item of trade (wa 91902). The figure stands with
one hand near her navel and the other cupping one breast; she has long hair,
multiple chokers and a prominent pubic triangle. Around her are the
moulds for a series of amulets, pins and ornaments, including a circular one
with a cruciform design also found on the metal stamp seals used at that time
in Turkey. Similar moulds continued to be made into the next millennium,
at a period when close contact between Mesopotamia and Turkey stimulated
the spread of literacy through large areas of the Near East.

Trade and Diplomacy:
the 2nd millennium BC
72 fhe site of Kiiltepe in central Turkey. In the foreground, a street and the mud-brick walls of part of the Assyrian trading colony (karum) have been excavated. Beyond are the slopes of the huge mound on which the city of Nesa once stood.
A
ccording to a later tradition, Sargon of Akkad had, in about 2300 BC,
mounted an expedition to rescue some merchants who had run into
trouble in Turkey; slightly later, merchants from Ur are also supposed to
have set up trading outposts there. So far these claims cannot be substanti
ated, but it is certain that around 1920 BC merchants from the Assyrian city
of Ashur established a trading colony or karum built over the remains of two 72
previous settlements around the foot of the huge city mound of Kiiltepe, just
north of Kayseri in central Turkey. The merchants’ colony (Level 2) was
destroyed by fire around 1840 bc and then rebuilt (Level ib), before being
finally destroyed in about 1740 BC. The remains of the karum now lie buried
beneath the fields surrounding the mound and the first evidence for its
existence came in the form of clay tablets and sealed envelopes inscribed in a
dialect of Akkadian in the cuneiform script, which farmers began finding
towards the end of the nineteenth century ad when they were digging in
their fields. The British Museum bought many of these, but it was several
decades before the precise source of the tablets was finally discovered, since
the farmers did not wish to divulge the location of such a rich form of
revenue. Levels 1 b and 2 have since been extensively excavated, and so have
the remains of the huge square palace on the mound; the two earlier levels
(3 and 4) of the karum have barely been touched.
The tablets have come to be known as the ‘Cappadocian Texts’ because
Kiiltepe lies in what was later the Roman province of Cappadocia. It has
been possible to establish from them the mechanics of a trade which brought
tin and textiles from Ashur to Kanesh (the ancient name of the karum).
These items were carried by donkey caravan and went through customs at
the palace of Nesa on the main city mound. The Assyrians then traded their
90






Ancient Near Eastern Art
merchandise for silver and gold; they were also involved in the lucrative
local copper and wool trade. All this, and much more, can be learnt from the
tablets, which record the business transactions and contracts of the mer
chants and their Anatolian counterparts, together with family and business
correspondence exchanged between Kanesh and Ashur. Evidence from a
number of sites shows that other cities had their own colonies of merchants
and were closely involved in the trade.
The tablets were encased in clay envelopes which were then inscribed
with a summarv of the contents of the tablet and sealed with the seals of the
participants in the transaction or witnesses to it. From their impressions it is
evident that the seals were tiny - even allowing for shrinkage of the clay on
which they were rolled. Some of the seals must have been brought from
Ashur, while others must have been cut locally, copying Assyrian designs.
Local Anatolians continued to use stamp seals but they also adopted the
cylinder seal shape, carving their cylinders in their own distinctive styles
with motifs adapted from Mesopotamian iconography. Some of the envel
opes bear the impressions of seals of Syrian and Babylonian merchants.
The Assyrian seals of this period often depict the type of presentation
scene which was developed in the Ur III period, but the tufted garments,
stools and headgear are represented in a distinctive toothed way and the
hand holding the cup is shaped like a two-pronged fork. Some scenes are
more lively, for instance that depicted on a seal made of haematite (a
metallic-looking dark-grey iron oxide used for the majority of seals during
the first four centuries of the second millennium bc).
The main characteristic of the local Anatolian style is the filling ofany and
every space so that animals, birds and detached heads are dovetailed to fit
into an intricate and finely cut design. The bodies of these creatures and the
garments of the figures are covered with hatching in different directions.
Often Mesopotamian motifs are misunderstood: for instance, on the seal
impression illustrated here, the main figure faces right, not left as in
Mesopotamia, and although he sits on a god’s throne, he does not have the
horned headdress of a deity. Before him is a huge jar with drinking straws:
often here, and in Syria, figures are shown drinking wine or beer through
tubes because of the surface scum produced by the fermentation process.
Although many impressions of cylinder seals of Anatolian type are known,
few actual seals have survived. Stamp seals were the type of seal most used
by the local population; these were often hammer-handled.
The worshipper and the griffin-headed figure on two of the seals illus
trated here hold vessels which have huge spouts in relation to their size.
Many examples of such jugs, generally made of fine red burnished ware,
have been found in excavations at Kiiltepe. Sometimes the vessels are so
elaborate that they were clearly for ceremonial rather than practical every
day use, but the inhabitants of the area had a predilection for complicated or

amusing shapes. Some of these vessels are in white burnished wares with red
and black painted decoration; shapes include boots, shells, men paddling
boats, animal and bird heads and whole animals. 74
Less sophisticated, but with an appeal of its own, is the stone mould
apparently found at Nineveh and so perhaps brought home from Anatolia
by an Assyrian merchant (wa 92666). It is the descendant of the stone
moulds discussed in Chapter 2 and was also used for casting lead figurines.
Il depicts a pair of figures, both shown frontally with hands clasped and
identified as deities by their horned headdresses and flounced robes; the
goddess wears a choker of a type which would have had an elaborate
necklace counterweight hanging down the back, and the god is bearded.
The other side of the mould could also be used for casting small amulets
shaped like a decorated sun-disc, a crescent moon and a small nude female
figure with hands clasped.
Excavations at Ashur, at the other end of the trade route from central
Turkey, have revealed little information concerning this period but we
know that Ashur became the seat of a dynasty under an Amorite king,
Shamshi-Adad I (reigned c. 1809-1776 bc), who established one of his sons,
lasmah-Addu, as ruler of the city of Mari on the Euphrates. The archives of
Mari have been excavated by the French and have provided fascinating
information on international politics, intrigues, transactions and the daily
life of the inhabitants of this and other cities in northern Mesopotamia and
beyond from about 1800 to 1760 bc. lasmah-Addu was lazy and immature,
and in one of the letters his father wrote to him, ‘How much longer must we
keep you on a leading rein? You are like a child, you are not a grown man,
you have no hair on your cheek. How much longer will you fail to direct
your own household properly?’ Epistolary activity was intense and archives
have been found at other sites in Syria and northern Mesopotamia, and in
Babylonia, particularly at Sippar; they combine to provide a better picture
of life in the Ancient Near East between 1900 and 1600 bc than can be
reconstructed for any other period.
Some of the Mari letters refer to dealings with Elam in south-western Iran
where there was a lively local dynasty centred on Susa, but the British
Museum has scam remains of this period. Other Mari letters tell of contacts
with kingdoms in Syria and northern Palestine. Excavations by Woolley in
Level VII at Tell Atchana have thrown light on this period of Syrian history
when the site, known as Alalakh, seems to have been a vassal city of the
kings of lamhad, now Aleppo. During Shamshi-Adad’s reign, Zimri-Lim,
the son of the previous king of Mari, had sought refuge at the court of
larimlim of lamhad and married his daughter, Shiptu, who returned with
him to Mari when he ousted lasmah-Addu and recovered his father’s
throne. Alalakh seems to have been the summer residence of the kings of
lamhad and they built a palace there. A fine male head, now in Antakya

Museum in Turkey, was thought by Woolley to be the head of larimlim, to
whom he ascribed the palace also, but in fact several kings of lamhad, and a
cousin of theirs who was governor of Alalakh, all bore the same name. This
we know from the royal archives which Woolley discovered in the palace.
The main archive probably dates from around 1720 to 1650 bc. In the
archive rooms, Woolley found large tusks of elephant ivory, imported from
Egypt or perhaps even India, and objects carved from ivory and bone.
Contact with Egypt was further demonstrated by the impressions of the
seals of the kings, their ministers and the merchants and inhabitants of
Alalakh on the clay envelopes of the documents stored in the archive room.

ankh. Hathor and Isis figures appear. Most popular was the Egyptian
winged sun-disc which entered Near Eastern iconography at this time and 75b
was later transmitted to Hittite, Assyrian, Urartian and Achaemenid art (see
Chapter 4).
Other, more local influences are also apparent on the seals. One of the
goddesses on Fig. 75a wears a square-topped, horned headdress (as it is
shown frontally, and not in profile, it resembles a top-hat); her robe is
decorated with thick borders which may represent fur trimming. Because
we do not know her name she is generally called the ‘Syrian goddess’. The
storm god Adad was particularly popular. He wears a distinctive pointed, 75b
horned headdress, has his hair in a long curl down his back, wears a kilt,
holds an axe and a flail, and brandishes a mace. Bull-men seem to have faded
from the Near Eastern repertory after the Akkadian period, but they had
made a reappearance on Babylonian seals of the nineteenth century bc and 82a
also appeared on the contemporary seal impressions of the Assyrian mer
chants in Turkey. In Syria, however, they are far closer to their Akkadian 59b
prototypes. Other subjects were also taken over from the Akkadian range of
motifs, particularly contest scenes where a nude, bearded hero with curls
96



Trade and Diplomacy: the 2nd millennium BC
wrestles with an inverted bull, grasps its tail and places his foot on its neck.
Because of their association with a well-dated archive, the Alalakh seal
impressions have made it possible to redate a whole group of haematite seals
which had previously been thought much later.
The finds made during the excavations of Level VII at Alalakh showed
evidence of other contacts. Woolley uncovered fragmentary wall-paintings
in the palace which suggested to him some similarity with those which had
been excavated on Crete, and on one fragment there was even the horn of a
bull recalling the famous ‘Toreador fresco’ from Knossos. One of the seal
impressions (in Antakya, Turkey), probably dating to around 1700 bc, had
a scene of bull-leaping on it but, although this was relatively close to the later
Cretan bull-leaping scenes of around 1550 bc, it was of local manufacture
and other Syrian seals of this period show similar scenes. However, the gap
between the Alalakh and Cretan material has now to some extent been filled
by the finds made by the Austrian archaeologist Manfred Bietak at Tell el
Daba in the Egyptian Delta, which include fragments of wall-paintings
showing unmistakable bull-leaping scenes dating to around 1650 BC. It was
around that date, or perhaps slightly later, that the Hittite king Hattusili I
marched into Syria, captured Aleppo and destroyed the Level VII palace at
Alalakh. A century and a half later, however, the site was to have another
brilliant chapter in its existence.
Southern Palestine seems to have been under more direct Egyptian
control or influence. The Middle Bronze Age tombs dug into the rock at
Jericho between 1900 and 1600 bc contain evidence of Egyptian contacts in
75c the form of large numbers of scarab-shaped seals of burnt steatite, Which
were carved with Egyptian motifs. At this period scarabs seem to have been
even more popular in Palestine than in Egypt and were probably made
locally. Wooden furniture and containers were surprisingly well preserved
in some of the tombs, one of which, Pi9, has been reconstructed in the
British Museum.
Tomb P19 was a low, oval chamber reached through a vertical shaft. It
had originally been excavated around 2200 bc but there were few remains of
the first occupant of the tomb and of his grave-goods because, some 500
years later, the tomb had been reopened, the original burial pushed to one
side, and a woman of about 28 had been buried with storage jars, baskets,
wooden platters and dishes containing meat and other types of food and
drink; there were also three tables and a stool. Slightly later the tomb had
once again been opened and six further bodies were laid out in a row on one
side of it. Analysis of the skeletal remains established that these were the
bodies of girls aged 11,15 and 17 > a boy of 11 and two young men of 24 and
28. All six had been killed by blows to the head and the three males had had
their right hand cut off. Two other Jericho tombs of about the same date
contained similarly executed and mutilated bodies. All three tombs were
97

also unusual in that they contained scarabs of amethyst, a stone imported
from Egypt at this time. There have been several suggestions as to the
reasons for these executions. It is most unlikely that this was the type of mass
burial which took place at Ur (see Chapter 2) with retainers accompanying
the owner of the tomb into the next world: there is no evidence of such a
custom in any of the other 504 tombs investigated at Jericho, and the bodies
of those executed were buried some time later than the main burial. It has
been suggested that the victims were tomb robbers caught in the act and
buried in the tomb they were robbing, but the bodies were carefully laid out,
with their seals and personal possessions, so this also seems unlikely. The 75c
most convincing explanation is that these were members of one important

The man has a disproportionately large head, braided hair hangs down his back, and he has a jutting beard.

family who were executed by Egyptian overlords, possibly after some
uprising: Egyptians frequently cut off the right hand of prisoners of war.
76 A different type of discussion has centred on a copper figure said to have
been found near Jezzine in the Lebanon, where other figures of the same
type supposedly originated. Their authenticity was questioned until a group
of closely similar figures was excavated at Tell Judeideh on the Syrian
Turkish border. The excavators dated their find to the early third millen
nium BC, but it seems likely that the figures came from a pit dug down from a
higher level, probably a thousand years later. Metal figurines of other types
were popular throughout southern Anatolia, Syria and Palestine at this
time.
After the death of Shamshi-Adad his kingdom collapsed and, as we have
seen, his son was replaced by a descendant of the previous Mari royal
family, named Zimri-Lim. He, in turn, was overthrown by Hammurabi of
Babylon (r. 1792-1750 bc). Hammurabi was the greatest ruler of an
Amorite dynasty which had been founded at Babylon a century earlier. For
a time it had been subject to one or other of the two dominant dynasties in
southern Mesopotamia, those of Isin and Larsa. Hammurabi succeeded in
overthrowing Rim-Sin of Larsa and gaining control of much of Meso
potamia. The early centuries of the second millennium BC are therefore
known as the Old Babylonian Period (the Middle and Late or Neo
Babylonian periods will be examined later in this chapter and in Chapter 4
78 respectively). Hammurabi is best known for his law-code, inscribed on a
stele on which he is depicted facing the sun god. The god’s horned
headdress is depicted with the horns in profile; this is the first well-dated
example of the divine headdress shown in profile, instead of frontally, on a
profile head (compare, for example, Fig. 82b), and marks a break with a
long-established convention; it demonstrates the sculptor’s new way of
looking at the world around him. Conversely, the depiction of the sun god
with rays rising from his shoulders is a return to the convention of the
Akkadian period some five hundred years earlier, which had long been
abandoned. The text of the stele had a profound impact on the Mesopota
mian world although it was by no means the first law-code of that type; it was
repeatedly copied for well over a thousand years, long after the stele had
been taken as booty to Susa in 1157 BC. The relief on the stele also had a
profound impact on Mesopotamian art; similar reliefs are found on other
79 stelae, and the British Museum has a fragmentary example.
77 A copper figure provides a three-dimensional version of the king on the
Hammurabi stelae. As on the stelae, the king wears the round cap with a
broad border which had been the headdress of royalty since at least the reign
of Gudea of Lagash some time before 2100 bc. Three-dimensional figures of

deified king or a deity. Since such scenes, carved in haematite, were the
most popular subject on Old Babylonian seals, the suppliant goddess
became the most representative icon of the times and was adopted into the 82b-c
iconography of the surrounding lands, where she survived for centuries.
Old Babylonian seals, though not as stereotyped or restricted in terms of
subject matter as those of the Third Dynasty of Ur, nevertheless conform to
a strict iconographical canon. On classic Old Babylonian seals from about
1850 bc onwards, figures are generally shown standing, instead of sitting as
had previously been the case.
A stone statue from Ur shows the upper part of a woman who wears the
flounced robe and choker of a deity but who clasps her hands in worship
(wa 132101). Her headdress is missing, so we cannot tell whether she was a
priestess or perhaps the consort of a god. Her eyes are inlaid (but the pupils
are missing) and traces of red and black paint survive. Fine stone carvings of 81
rams’ heads were also found at Ur.
Figures of deities and worshippers were also made of terracotta, and the
skill expended on the modelling, firing and painting of these large-scale
pieces shows that although they may have been a cheaper substitute for
bronze and stone they were still highly prized. The torso of a woman with
hands clasped (wa 135680) is almost life-size. She wears her hair in an

Smaller-scale terracottas were mass-produced in moulds and widely
distributed; they illustrate popular, rather than official cults and are proba
bly responsible for the wide dissemination of iconographical themes. Most
numerous are naked or bikini-clad female figures with hands clasped or
playing musical instruments, but naked male lute-players, embracing
couples (clothed and unclothed), beds and a few erotic scenes indicate that
fertility was a major consideration of those who acquired them. Several
show deities and may have been set up in private chapels. In the Bible there
is a lively account (Genesis 31:22-35) of how Rachel stole her father’s
household gods and hid them in a camel saddle on which she sat. When her
father, Laban, came to her tent to search for them she said ‘Don’t be angry,
my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I am having my period.’
And Laban fell for the oldest trick in the world. The story demonstrates the
importance attached to these sometimes crude figurines. Several from Ur

onwards, and door-jambs decorated with demon heads and statues of female
deities holding vessels from which flow streams of water. The temple built
around 1800 bc at Tell el Rimah in northern Iraq had stone door-jambs
bearing similar decoration. Demon heads, sometimes shaped like coiled
intestines, were supposed to resemble the giant Humbaba who protected the
cedar forests of Lebanon and who had been killed by the epic heroes
Gilgamesh and Enkidu. Some terracottas, however, have genre scenes, 84c-d
possibly illustrating myths or legends. Finally, some terracottas show cult
scenes with harp and lyre players, drummers and boxers (e.g. wa 91906).

to have collapsed. Several theories have been put forward to explain this,

Euphrates for political ends which backfired when it was found it could not
be reversed. Whatever the reasons for the decline in the fortunes of
Babylonia, its final collapse in 1595 bc was the result of a totally unexpected
raid by the Hittites from central Turkey. They swept down the Euphrates,
overthrew Babylon and disappeared as suddenly as they had arrived,
carrying off with them the city-god of Babylon, Marduk.
Who were these Hittites who so abruptly burst onto the international
stage and brought about the end of a dynasty which had been established for
centuries? We know something of their history because they adopted the
cuneiform script of their neighbours and predecessors and their archives
have been excavated at their capital Hattusa (now Bogazkoy). They also
used a hieroglyphic script which has been found on some inscribed seals and
rock reliefs, but it was mostly written on perishable materials which have
not survived. Their language, which they called Nesite, was Indo-European
and, like other Indo-Europeans including the Luwians, they probably
entered Turkey, perhaps from south Russia, in the last part of the third
millennium bc. The country they invaded seems to have been called Haiti
and to have been inhabited by Haitians so the newcomers, confusingly,
came to be known as ‘inhabitants of the land of Haiti' and therefore I littiles.
The Haitians and Hittites probably lived peaceably until, in about 1740 BC,
a large number of sites (including the city of I lattusa) and their karums were
destroyed, perhaps, but not certainly, by the Hittites. Some time later,
Hattusa was rebuilt and the Hittite ruler Hattusili established his capital
there. The Hittite raid on Babylon was preceded by raids into Syria (one of
which destroyed Aleppo and Level VII at Tell Alchana) but a period of
dynastic instability meant that these initial successes were not followed up.
There is evidence for a period of disruption between 1600 and about
1500 BC all over the Near East and in Egypt. Then, gradually, come signs of
recovery and growing stability. Palaces were rebuilt, cities were re
inhabited, trade resumed and works of art were once again commissioned.
The campaigns of the Egyptian pharaoh Tuthmosis III in Syria during the
early fifteenth century led to a revival of political and territorial ambitions.
Jn Turkey the Hittites began to look southwards again. Most of the
information and artefacts which have survived relate to the period between
about 1400 and 1200 bc, which is known as the Hittite Empire. Sup
piluliuma I restored Hittite fortunes, wrested control of Syria from the
Egyptians and made his son king of Carchemish, on the Euphrates where it
crosses from Turkey into Syria, thereby inaugurating a long period of
Hittite rule in that city which probably continued uninterrupted into the
first millennium BC. Opinions are divided as to whether he came to the
throne around 1380 and reigned for about sixty years, or around 1340 and
reigned for only twenty years. The dates are important since they affect
Egyptian chronology.
104



Trade and Diplomacy: the 2nd millennium BC
A queen of Egypt wrote to Suppiluliuma while he was encamped before
Carchemish: ‘My husband has died and I have no son, but of you it is said
that you have many sons. If you would send me one of your sons, he could
become my husband. I will on no account take one of my subjects and make
him my husband. I am very much afraid.’ Suppiluliuma sent an envoy to
check on the authenticity of this bizarre request and received a second
desperate plea from the queen. Convinced, he duly sent one of his sons but
the latter was murdered on his arrival in Egypt. The queen is generally
thought to have been Ankhesenamun, a daughter of the Egyptian pharaoh
Akhenaten and widow of Tutankhamun. The poor little queen was prob
ably forced to marry Ai, a priest who became the next pharaoh and who had
no doubt engineered the murder of the Hittite prince.
During the fourteenth century bc the Hittites and their neighbours to the
west, the Arzawans, took part in the international correspondence with the
Egyptian pharaohs known as the Amarna Letters. These letters were written
on clay tablets in the cuneiform script in Akkadian, the language of
Mesopotamia which was used for diplomatic correspondence throughout
the Near East. One of them is from Suppiluliuma. He complains that since
the accession of the new pharaoh, perhaps Tutankhamun, the gold and
silver statues the previous pharaoh had promised have not been sent.
Nevertheless, he, Suppiluliuma, is sending silver drinking vessels - one
shaped like a stag and the other like a ram - and two huge silver discs, a total
86 weight of 18 minas of silver (about 9 kg). There is a silver stag-shaped Hittite
drinking vessel in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Trade in
precious metals and objects was obviously carried out at the highest level.
87 Of local manufacture and smaller proportions, however, is a little gold
figure of a Hittite god. Hittite deities wore the horned headdress of
Mesopotamian deities but in a taller, more pointed version. This little kilted
figure has the stocky proportions of Hittite gods on rock-cut reliefs decorat
ing a gate at Bogazkoy and the open-air sanctuary at nearby Yazihkaya. His
round, clean-shaven head with carefully modelled features and large eyes is
set on a thick neck which juts forwards. This same characteristic jutting
85 neck is found on a small ivory figurine of a young girl. The identity and
function of this charming figure are uncertain.
When he was digging at Carchemish before the First World War,
Leonard Woolley made a particularly interesting discovery. He was ex
cavating levels containing evidence of the sack of Carchemish by Nebuchad
nezzar of Babylon in 605 bc, and within the walls of the city he found a
cremation burial. This was unusual because at that time cremation ceme
teries were generally outside the city. Although the bones were in a coarse
domestic pot instead of the normal urn, the burial was a rich one and this led
Woolley to suggest that it was that of an important person who had died or
been killed during the siege. The grave-goods included a large cylinder of
85 Ivory figurine of a young Hittite girl with her hair drawn back from her low forehead into a long plait which reaches almost to her waist. Her breasts are small and her body lacks the curves of an adult. The stance is artificial but the execution is naturalistic, with the exception of the ear volutes and the small double triangles at the knees echoing the shape of her pubic triangle (originally inlaid). There is a dowel-hole in the base. 14001200 BC. Hl 12 cm.

lapis lazuli and gold tassels from the end of a belt. Minute gold beads, which
had fused together because of the heat of the cremation, had probably been
stitched to a garment. A gold disc and strip with openwork decoration and
small gold figures inlaid with lapis lazuli or steatite represent Hittite gods as
they were depicted in the Yazihkaya shrine; they may have been attached to
heirlooms which were placed beside the burial while the ashes were still hot.
Two of these, one inlaid and one with incised decoration, show the Hittite 88
sun god wearing royal robes, carrying the carved rod which was an emblem
of kingship, and identified by the winged sun-disc on his head - the latter, as
we have seen, a symbol of kingship imported from Egypt, probably via
Syria. The iconography of these minute jewels is so close to that of gods and
goddesses at Yazihkaya that it is likely that they were heirlooms from the
thirteenth century BC, when the rock-cut sanctuary was carved with the
deities worshipped by the Hittite king Tudhaliya IV and his Hurrian 18
mother, a princess from Cilicia on the Turkish coast, or from Syria.
Although the best-known, thanks to references to them in the Bible and to
their fortunate habit of using the cuneiform script, the Hittites were not the
only people in Turkey at this lime. To the west lay the kingdom of Arzawa,
and many other lands are mentioned in Hittite texts: however, the problems
of reconstructing the political map ofTurkey are numerous. A gold necklace 89
with eagles holding discs in their talons may have come from the west of
Turkey. An origin closer to Syria may be postulated for the bronze figure of
a robed god, with ears pierced for earrings, who wears a dagger in his belt
(wai 34926). His headdress has been reduced to a series of horizontal ridges
rather than horns, and is tall and pointed, resembling a dunce’s cap.
The Hittites continued to use stamp seals, except in their territories in
north Syria where they used cylinder seals. Often the seals are similar to the
earlier hammer-handled haematite seals and one example in the British
Museum (wa 115655) is interesting because it bears the same sequence of
designs as on some other seals and on the silver stag-shaped drinking cup in 86
New York referred to above. It was acquired near Bogazkoy in 1886 and the
design on its circular base surrounds a hieroglyphic inscription giving the
name and title of the owner. It shows a seated god holding a bird; behind
him are a stag’s head and two legs, a hunting bag, a quiver (?), two spears
and a tree; before the god are an altar, a bird-headed figure pouring a
libation and a figure playing a drum; at the end of the scene two bull-men
kneel on either side of a sun-disc on a stand.
In their expansion into Syria, the Hittites came into conflict with the
Mitannians, who had established a kingdom stretching right across north
Syria and northern Mesopotamia. One of the Mitannian vassal kings around
1500 bc was named Idrimi and ruled at Alalakh, a city whose earlier
fortunes have already been traced (page 94) and where he built a palace
(Level IV). His life can be reconstructed from the long inscription which
108



Trade and Diplomacy: the 2nd millennium BC
90 covered his statue. Idrimi claimed descent from the kings of lamhad
(Aleppo) of the eighteenth century bc and he may be wearing a version of
the dress worn by the kings of lamhad on the seal impressions found in the
75a Level VII archive discussed above. Idrimi is not beautiful (he was described
by C. J. Gadd as ‘the ugliest man I never met’). He gazes balefully from huge
eyes, and the corners of his mouth turn down. His lack of chin is evident
despite his plain beard. He lays his right hand on his breast and his left lies
clenched on his lap.
The inscription runs from the side of his face to the bottom of his skirt; the
back is uninscribed. It tells how, due to a hostile incident, Idrimi and his
family had had to flee from Aleppo to his mother’s family at Emar (now
Meskene), on the Euphrates. Determined to restore the family fortunes,
Idrimi left Emar and went to Canaan, where he found other refugees from
his father’s kingdom; he mounted a sea-borne expedition to recover his
patrimony and eventually became a vassal of the Mitannian king Barattarna,
who installed him as king in Alalakh. Later, he raided into Hittite territory
and used the booty to build his palace. He restored the towns in his kingdom
and had been reigning thirty years when he had his statue inscribed by the
scribe Sharruwa.
But did Idrimi in fact commission the inscription? Jack Sasson has
suggested that, in fact, Sharruwa lived much later than Idrimi and carved
the inscription in order to bolster national pride by providing evidence of
the city’s glorious past, at a time when the foreign domination of the Hittites
was on the wane. He bases his arguments on the unusual autobiographical
style of the inscription, and on the fact that it is quite unparalleled-for a
scribe to claim authorship. Furthermore, Idrimi’s statue was not found in
Level IV - the level of his palace - but in the Level IB temple (about 1250
1200 bc). It seems that the statue was, at that time, socketed onto a specially
made grey basalt base carved as a throne, with lions - or more probably
sphinxes - on either side, whose raised wings would have hidden the
uncarved sides of the statue, but of which there remain only the legs (visible
from the sides but not from the front). At the time of the final destruction of
Alalakh (see below), the statue was toppled from its base and its head and
feet were broken off. Later the fragments were carefully collected and
buried in a pit dug for the purpose. Sasson has argued that the statue was
contemporary with Level I and was not the antiquity it purported to be.
Whatever the truth of the matter, there is no doubt that a king named
Idrimi was associated with Level IV because documents of his reign, sealed
with his seal, have been found in the archives Woolley discovered here also.
Idrimi’s seal was later used by his grandson, Niqmepa, as a dynastic seal.
Niqmepa used another royal seal, which is in the style of the Level VII seals
but does not seem to have belonged to a ruler of lamhad. He was not alone
among his contemporaries in using the seals of his forebears, and other
109



Ancient Near Eastern Art
kings, as well as private individuals, used earlier seals as status symbols or to
authenticate their dynastic or hereditary claims, after the unsettled period
separating Levels VII and IV.
One of the reasons for this emphasis on stone seals lay in the widespread
use of an alternative and less prestigious material known as faience (a
confusing name since it has nothing to do with the much later products of
the city of Faenza in Italy). The technology of faience is closely related to
that of glass, and the main component of both is silica. Faience contains less
alkali than glass and is fired at a lower temperature so that only the surface is
vitrified or ‘glazed’. Although faience occurs from the fourth millennium bc
onwards, its use was not widespread until the second half of the second
millennium BC when glass technology was developed. Faience cylinders
were cheap to produce and easy to carve. The same designs were repeated
over and over again, with local variations. Although their brightly coloured
vitrified surface has now generally worn away, they must have been
attractive and were widely traded as beads and seals. These simple objects,
which rarely have artistic merit, are nevertheless a good indication of the
trade patterns of the period. Similar designs, possibly from the same
workshops, have been found from the Caucasus to the Gulf and from Greece
to Iran; some were found in the wreck of a ship which sank around 1300 BC
off the south coast ofTurkey, near Ka§. The popularity of these faience seals
is illustrated by the large number used to seal documents in the archives
found at Nuzi, near Kirkuk in northern Iraq. Brightly coloured necklaces
from the Fosse Temple at Lachish in southern Palestine give some idea of
the attractive appearance of faience beads; they were made around 1300 BC,
either in Egypt or under strong Egyptian influence (wa 132125-6).
The workshops producing seals, and the archives where their use is best
attested, are spread throughout northern Syria and northern Iraq in the area
which came under the domination of the kingdom of Mitanni. The Mitan
nian capital was at Washshukani, somewhere near the head-waters of the
River Khabur in Syria, and the kingdom seems to have been ruled by an
Indo-European aristocracy who worshipped Indo-European gods and for
whom the chariot was a prestige vehicle. The population of the Mitannian
kingdom was ethnically different, however; it was Hurrian. Hurrians,
speaking a non-Semitic, non-Indo-European language, probably first en
tered Syria and Mesopotamia from eastern Turkey during the second half of
the third millennium, and by 1700 BC they formed about a third of the
population at Alalakh. Two hundred and fifty years later they were the
dominant element in the population. Idrimi ofAlalakh was, as we have seen,
a vassal of the Mitannians and so, until they broke free in the fourteenth
century bc, were the Assyrian kings.
There has been much discussion as to whether there is such a thing as
Mitannian or Hurrian art. It seems more likely that the predominantly east

Ancient Near Eastern Art
west trade routes which traversed the kingdom carried ideas, iconography
and techniques which were adopted and adapted to form something more
specifically Syrian in the west and Assyrian in the east. A distinctive type of
painted pottery is found throughout the area occupied by the Mitannians,
although it too has variations, being known as Nuzi Ware in the east and
Atchana Ware in the west. Tall, thin-walled beakers, precariously balancing
on a small foot, are painted in a dark brown or black paint upon which the
predominantly floral decoration is applied in white paint in horizontal bands
alternating with triangles, zigzags or running spirals. At Tell Atchana the 91
local variation, probably the work of a single workshop, shows exuberant
vegetation loosely based on Egyptian designs and linked by dotted, undulat
ing bands. The same basic design was not restricted to cups but was skilfully
adapted to vessels of very different shapes, sometimes combined with
rosettes or mountain-scale patterns.
Glass, which has already been mentioned in connection with faience, is
also thought to be an invention of the period. There are a few small glass
beads (but no vessels) of the third millennium BC but these were probably
produced accidentally by over-firing faience; however, the discovery of two
lumps of true glass in late third-millennium contexts al Eridu and al Tell
Asmar in Iraq is less easy to explain. It was the invention of the technique of
core-forming, whereby a thick coaling of molten glass was applied over a
removable earthenware core, that enabled vessels to be produced. The
earliest datable example of the technique was found at Tell Atchana
(Alalakh) in Level VI (i.e. before 1500 bc), but it has been suggested that it
was imported from northern Mesopotamia, where the technique suddenly
appears, associated with the same type of thread decoration, at a number of
sites including Tell Brak, Nineveh, Ashur and Nuzi. The transfer of the
technique via the Levant ports to Egypt took place soon afterwards.
Another, contemporary, technique for making mosaic glass beakers consis- 92
ted in laying small cylindrical rods of coloured glass side by side to form
chevron patterns; the result was fired in a mould, ground and polished.
Examples have been found in northern Iraq and at Marlik, south of the
Caspian Sea in Iran.
The term ‘Mitannian’ is applied to a seal style but that style, as we have
seen, is linked to a material (faience) and a technique of manufacture rather
than to a political entity. However, the same is not true of the seal style
developed during the fourteenth century bc by the Assyrians. At the
beginning of this chapter we saw how, in the early centuries of the second
millennium, the Assyrian capital al Ashur had grown rich on the proceeds of
trade with central Turkey, and Shamshi-Adad I made it the capital of his
north Mesopotamian kingdom. Under Hammurabi, Babylon eclipsed
Ashur, but when, in the fourteenth century, Assyria emerged from the dark
age which followed the fall of Babylon in 1595 bc, it was as a vassal of

Mitanni. However, during the course of the century the increasing political
awareness in the Near East affected Assyria, and Ashur-uballit I (r. 1363
1328 bc) succeeded in throwing off the Mitannian yoke. He even dared to
initiate correspondence with the Amarna pharaohs, sending a chariot, two
horses and a ‘date’ of lapis lazuli. However, the pharaoh’s gift in return was
not as generous as Ashur-uballit had hoped, and he had no scruples in
writing to complain that it had not even covered his messengers’ travelling
expenses; he asked for a lot more gold because he was building a new palace.
From his reign onwards, Assyria grew ever more powerful, and although
there was a period of eclipse during the dark age at the turn of the
millennium, the political basis for the Neo-Assyrian empire of the ninth to
seventh centuries bc was first established in what has come to be known as
the Middle Assyrian period, when the foundations of the Assyrian style
were also laid.
Contemporary seal designs reflect these political developments and even
anticipate them. The cylinder seals rolled out on the tablets in the archives
found at various sites within the Assyrian kingdom, but especially at Ashur,
show a predominance of‘Mitannian’ seals replaced, as early as the reign of
Eriba-Adad I (1390-1364 bc), by a Middle Assyrian style with an emphasis
on balanced compositions featuring a revival of earlier composite creatures 93
and the creation of new ones, for instance griffins, winged horses and
centaurs. The Middle Assyrian style can be documented as it evolves from
reign to reign. The stones used in Assyria and in Babylonia are also often
new types, such as variants of chalcedony in attractive colours including
carnelian, which had been used only rarely for seals up till then. New
techniques now enabled these hard stones to be cut with beautiful designs.
Another distinctive artefact of the period is made of faience. It consists of
a small human mask, originally with inlaid eyes, eyebrows and necklace,
with holes pierced in the ears for earrings (wa 120430). The inlays have
generally vanished, but an example from Tell el Rimah was inlaid with
coloured glass. The earrings have also vanished but were probably made of
gold. The purpose of these small masks is uncertain. Some were, presum
ably - like the Warka Head, their predecessor by about 2,000 years - part of
a composite figure of which other parts were made of perishable materials
such as wood and textiles, and they may have been set up in temples, like the
Rimah head; this latter was found with a faience pubic triangle, suggesting
that both pieces belonged to a naked figure. One example was found at Mari
lying on the chest of a body in a grave; since no earrings were found in the
holes in its ears, it was suggested that these were for the thongs attaching it
round the neck of the deceased. These objects are concentrated within the
Middle Assyrian area but are also found further east, west and south; they
are generally dated around 1300 bc.

Tukulti-Ninurta, have produced beautifully worked ivories and objects of
faience and lead. Some have found their way into the collections of the
British Museum. Another interesting artefact is a green serpentinite
whetstone with a bronze ram’s head as its handle, excavated by Rassam at
Sippar in 1881 or 1882 (wa 93077). It is inscribed with a dedication to the
sun god Shamash by Tukulti-Mer, a king of Hana on the Euphrates in the
eleventh century BC. Since the emblem of Shamash was the saw-toothed
knife with which he cut his way through the mountains of the east at dawn, a
whetstone was a particularly appropriate votive object. Its discovery at
Sippar demonstrates the continued importance of that city as a centre for the
worship of the sun god.
An approximately life-size statue of a lusciously plump naked woman was
excavated at Nineveh. The seven-line inscription above the waist on the
back informs us that she, and others like her, were set up by Ashur-bel-kala
‘in the provinces, cities and garrisons for enjoyment’. This has been taken as
an expression of the purely secular role of the sculpture but need not

necessarily preclude the representation of a goddess; some, indeed, have
argued that this is precisely what this statue is and that the lack of detail
indicates that she was originally dressed in rich garments. Since no head is
preserved, the presence or absence of a horned headdress cannot be invoked
in favour of an identification. What is certain, however, is that the piece is a
most unusual work of art and is unique on such a scale. The only surviving
parallels are two small half-clad figures showing the same rounded bellies
and pubic triangles: one is winged (and probably therefore a goddess) and
decorates an alabaster vessel found at Ashur; the other is a bone or ivory
figurine from Nuzi wearing the horned headdress of a goddess. Both are
probably a couple of centuries earlier. A suggestion that the sculpture was
an earlier Babylonian piece carried off as booty by the Assyrians is also
hypothetical, since no comparable sculpture has been found in Babylonia.
The attribution of a second piece of sculpture is less certain, although
most scholars now agree that it should also belong to the reign of Ashur-bel
kala rather than to that of his father, who is named in the inscription. Il is the
so-called ‘Broken Obelisk’, found in the same ditch as the nude figure just
discussed. This is, in fact, the stepped top of a rectangular stele (w a 118898)
and is the first of a series of Assyrian monuments of this type. It bears a relief
showing the king standing before the symbols of the gods; from the winged
sun-disc two hands emerge, one of which extends a bow and arrows to the
king, who holds on a leash round their necks two pairs of prisoners who raise
their hands in supplication.
Once even more hotly debated was the attribution ofyet another Assyrian
stele known as the ‘White Obelisk’ (wa 118807). It is decorated on all four
sides with scenes of military campaigns, the bringing of tribute, victory
banquets, religious and hunting scenes. The accompanying inscription
names an Ashurnasirpal and should be dated to around 1050 BC, although
some scholars have opted for a later date. Holly Pittman has suggested that
the seemingly disordered sequence of scenes actually makes sense if it is seen
as the record of the decoration of the walls of a throne-room. Such
decoration would have been painted or executed in glazed bricks, but very
little survives. In any case, grouped together here we have the earliest
representations of what were to be the main themes of Assyrian narrative art
from the ninth centurv onwards.
Babylonia had a separate development since it was too far south to have
been part of the Mitannian kingdom. After the fall of Babylon in 1595 BCthe
records cease; later king-lists give the names of rulers and their length of
reign but little else is known of them. These names are predominantly
Kassite and it seems that the Kassites stepped into the power vacuum
created by the fall ofthe dynasty of Hammurabi. Not much is known oftheir
origin. Their distinctive names and those of their gods indicate that they
were possibly of Caucasian stock and were led by an Indo-Aryan aristoc

racy. They were thought to have entered Mesopotamia from the east, but
there is growing evidence for a north-western origin and Kassite names are
attested at Hana on the Middle Euphrates from the eighteenth century BC
onwards. However, it is only from the late fifteenth century that we can link
historical events and rulers.
One of the reasons for this dearth of information relates to the dark age
already referred to. With the collapse of the urban-based economy, the
major source of texts disappeared. As we have seen, a rural economy based
on villages and country estates provides less scope for the archaeologist:
there is also less need for complicated record-keeping and accounts, so there
are fewer or no texts. A further difficulty in identifying Kassite remains lies
in the fact that the Kassites were not innovators: they adopted the language
and way of life they found in southern Mesopotamia and became completely
integrated. They restored existing temples, and it is only under Karaindash
(about 1420 bc) that there is evidence at Uruk of a new form of temple.
118



Trade and Diplomacy: the 2nd millennium BC
During the next century there was extensive building activity at their new
95 capital at Dur Kurigalzu (now Aqar Quf, just north of Baghdad). The site is
still dominated by the ziggurat they built, which is exceptionally well
preserved. Excavations of the palaces there have produced very fine gold
work, elaborately decorated glass and lively terracottas. The goldwork
shows that very fine granulation, generally in chevrons or triangles, was
96 used. This technique is also to be found on gold from other sites, probably of
slightly earlier date.
Between 1375 and 1333 the Kassite kings Kadashman-Enlil I and Bur
naburiash II exchanged several letters with the Amarna pharaohs from
which it is clear that Egyptian and Babylonian princesses were traded for
gold and lapis lazuli, chariots and beds inlaid with precious materials.
Dowry lists include textiles, vessels of metal and stone, carved ivory objects
and furniture. There are constant complaints on both sides about the way
messengers and princesses are being treated, with the Kassite kings pointing
out on more than one occasion that the gold they had been sent, when melted
down, had proved of poor quality. Lapis lazuli is almost always qualified as
‘genuine’, probably because there were excellent glass imitations of the rare
blue stone. In sending lapis lazuli to Egypt the Kassite kings were continu
ing a well-established tradition. A temple hoard of about 1800 bc found at
Tod in Egypt contained scrap lapis lazuli including broken and worn seals
from much earlier periods. Another hoard was found at Thebes in Greece
and contained a large number of Kassite seals of lapis lazuli, including a seal
naming a high official of Burnaburiash, possibly part of the booty seized by
the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (r. 1243-1207 bc) when he captured
Babylon and raided its temple and palace treasuries.
97a In the British Museum there is a seal belonging to the father of that same
high official. It is typical of seals of the ‘First Kassite Group’. The long
inscription left only a relatively tall, narrow space, which was filled with the
figure of a seated god accompanied by symbols. Whereas the inscription is
beautifully engraved, the scene is stereotyped and uninspired, executed

with cutting-wheels of different sizes and with small drills. The use of these
tools made it possible for the Kassites, their contemporaries and their
successors to use harder stones such as chalcedony and other quartzes, and
other brightly coloured and unusual stones. Seals of the ‘Second Kassite
Group’, like the lapis lazuli one from Thebes which has already been
mentioned, are far more imaginative in their designs and are better cut.
Possibly the best-known Kassite artefacts are the so-called ‘boundary
stones’ or kudurru which were set up in temples as records of land grants.
They are irregularly shaped stone boulders, often of black limestone or
diorite, carved with a text and with the symbols of gods and goddesses, or
with the figures of kings. They are most plentiful from the twelfth century
BC onwards and continue into the next millennium (see Chapter 4). This
means that they were mostly carved after the fall of the Kassites and the
capture of the major Babylonian cities by the Elamites from south-western
Iran, under their king Shutruk-Nahhunte I, in about 1157 bc. Among the
booty carted off at this time, and excavated by the French at Susa over thirty
centuries later, were several kudurrus, and the famous stelae of the Vultures,
of Naram-Sin and of Hammurabi which had been set up in the major cities
of Babylonia in the third and early second millennia bc. These are now

excavated at Susa which have thrown light on developments in Iran during
the second half of the second millennium. The alternation between seden
tary and nomadic cultures, which has been a permanent characteristic of
Iranian history, results in periods when very little is known of the art and 97c
cultural developments of the population.
In the second half of the fourteenth century bc, Untash-Napirisha
sponsored a Middle Elamite royal style which is best exemplified in the
religious city he built at Choga Zanbil near Susa. A glazed wall-plaque from
the site, bearing his name, was presented to the Museum by the excavator,
Roman Ghirshman ( wa i 32225). It has relief floral decoration in the corners
reminiscent of that later painted onto similar wall-plaques from Assyria in 107
the ninth century bc. Some 200 clay figurines of fat women holding their
breasts were excavated by W. K. Loftus at Susa, of which forty are in the 101
British Museum. A bronze attachment, possibly forming the arm-rest of a 102
chair, is shaped like a charming little Ondine. It is said to have been found in
an area of western Iran between Susa and Shiraz where later rock reliefs are
located.
Also to be dated to around 1300 BC are bitumen discs in copper frames,
with a decorated surface originally covered with gold leaf attached to a silver
base by heating and burnishing - a technique known as diffusion bonding;
in one case this gold leaf survives (wa 134907). Horned animals recline
around a central rosette between bands of rope patterns. The purpose of
these roundels is not clear, but they may have been harness decoration.
It is to one of the sons and successors of Shutruk-Nahhunte, the con
queror of the Kassites, that we owe a particularly touching chalcedony jewel 103
which can be dated between about 1150 and 1120 bc. It is inscribed in
Elamite in the cuneiform script: ‘I, Shilhak-Inshushinak, enlarger of the
kingdom, this ia-dsh-pu from [the land of] Puralish I took. What I
painstakingly made I placed here, and to Bar-Uli, my beloved daughter, I
gave [it].’ The word used to describe the stone is the same as our word
jasper. Chalcedony and jasper are both quartzes but over the millennia the
term jasper has slightly changed its meaning and is now applied to a quartz
made opaque by a higher proportion of impurities.
The Elamite defeat of the Kassites was but one of the shattering events
which took place during the twelfth century bc. All over the Near East
populations were on the move, and this caused major repercussions. Indo
European Medes and Persians were entering Iran at this time and settling in
the west of the country. As a result, Shutruk-Nahhunte’s raid had no sequel,
and a new dynasty, known as the Second Dynasty of Isin, was able to seize
power in Babylonia; it was responsible for the boundary stones which we
examined above. The Assyrians hung on to their independence, but the
days of territorial expansion were gone and new peoples, the Aramaeans,
were settling on their borders.

In the west the Israelites had moved into the land of Canaan during the
latter part of the thirteenth century. The country at that time was under
strong Egyptian influence. A burial of this date found at Tell es-Sa’idiyeh,
on the east bank of the River Jordan, contained a skeleton lying face-down.
There were two fish skeletons on the back of the skull, and over the genitals
was a bronze bowl containing an ivory cosmetic box shaped like an Egyptian 104
bulti-hsh. This is the Nile tilapia which lays its eggs and then hatches them in
its mouth; this peculiar habit led to the bulti-fish becoming an Egyptian
symbol of resurrection and thus particularly appropriate in a funerary
context.
Further west a major economic catastrophe caused a chain reaction with
large numbers of people forced to become refugees. It is not known whether
this was the result of natural disaster or due to one of the periodic outbreaks
of piracy which have plagued the Mediterranean at various periods in its
history. The Trojan wars recounted by Homer are probably to be seen in the
context of these events. The ever-increasing army of refugees, referred to as
the ‘Sea Peoples’ in the texts, moved through the Aegean and Turkey, south
into Syria and Palestine and were finally defeated in major land and sea
battles by the Egyptians under Ramesses III in about 1195 bc. The
126

remnants of the Sea Peoples eventually settled; among them were the
Peleset, later known as the Philistines, who gave their name to the area
called Palestine. But in their wake the Sea Peoples had left a trail of
destruction. Many major cities disappeared for ever, including Alalakh and
Ugarit. The Hittites were so weakened by the invasion that they fell prey to
their traditional enemies the Kaska, who swept down from the Black Sea.
These political upheavals heralded a new dark age.

T
he dark age brought about by the political upheavals and mass migra
tions of the late second millennium bc continued for several centuries
and encompassed almost the whole of the Ancient Near East. Egypt was also
affected and its chronological framework is as a result so unreliable that it
has even been suggested that the Third Intermediate Period which suc
ceeded the New Kingdom is, in fact, the result of a series of errors and that
some 350 years should be deducted from the generally accepted chronologi
cal scheme. Although it is certain that there are some inconsistencies and
errors, it is impossible to remove even a few years in the chronology of one
area without seriously affecting that of another. Throughout the dark age,
the Assyrians continued to keep a detailed record of their kings and the
lengths of their reigns. Frequently we have annals recording the events of
these reigns, and we have contemporary monuments inscribed for the kings
themselves. Although the king-lists for southern Mesopotamia are less
complete, the number of correlations with events in Assyria make it quite
impossible to remove 350 years from the history of Mesopotamia. Although
few inscriptions survive in Anatolia and Syria, there is growing evidence of
continuity in the branches of the Hittite royal family ruling in Carchemish
and Malatya, and the names of dynasts succeeding each other in neighbour
ing city states are also recorded. As the Assyrians became more powerful, so
their contacts - peaceful and otherwise - with their neighbours became
more numerous, and from the ninth century bc onwards events can be dated
either precisely or to within a very few years.
Because of its firm chronology, Assyria is normally used as the starting
point for any discussion of Near Eastern art during the first four centuries of
the first millennium bc. Paradoxically, however, the artefacts of the early
128



Great Empires: the I st millennium BC
centuries of the first millennium are probably less well dated than those of
any other period in Mesopotamian history. There are several reasons for
this. Assyrian art is marked by strong continuity, and monuments of the
Middle Assyrian period (see Chapter 3) served as models for the later kings
of Assyria, who often consciously revived earlier styles. As Assyrian power
grew, so its influence on the artistic production of its neighbours increased.
Craftsmen beyond the borders of the Assyrian empire attempted to imitate
the Assyrian court style, while others from subject nations were brought to
Assyria and produced objects for their Assyrian patrons in a mixture of local
and Assyrian styles and iconographies. As a result, there is an international
ism in all types of artefact. For instance, Assyrian reliefs show similar items
of furniture being carried off as booty from a variety of locations, and the
surviving decorated metal fittings of such furniture are almost identical
throughout the Near East. The problem is further compounded by the fact
that the richest source of information is provided by finds made in the
storerooms of the Assyrian palaces: these were used for storage for several
centuries, with material from different campaigns - geographically and
chronologically - often being stored together. It is also difficult to make
comparisons between one class of object and another since the iconographi
cal repertoire and the decorative motifs used by the different groups of
craftsmen rarely overlap. The Assyrian reliefs can be relatively closely dated

because they were set up in their palaces by known kings; however, the
scenes depicted on ivories and cylinder seals are either completely different
or are treated in quite another way. The following examples, drawn from
comparisons between reliefs and seals, serve to illustrate the problems.
When Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883-859 bc) built his new palace on an earlier
mound at Nimrud, he decorated the main rooms with gypsum slabs over
two metres high which were carved in low relief, and with huge gateway
figures of winged human-headed bulls and lions. It is thought that the
palaces of the Neo-Hittite and Aramaean cities of northern Syria and south
eastern Anatolia served as an inspiration, although the execution was in a
different style and on quite another scale. Some of the scenes depicted
military campaigns, generally divided into two registers by a band of 11
cuneiform inscription (this latter was largely cut away in order to facilitate
transport to London, but can be reconstructed as it is a standard inscription
repeated throughout the palace). Some of the reliefs showed the king and his 105

court: these covered the whole height of the slabs, although the inscription
ran across these slabs too. The king sits on a padded stool but the hexagonal
design of the material covering the seat already appears on the dress of
Marduk-nadin-ahhe in the early eleventh century bc and reappears on a
group of spectacular royal seals which were probably made in a royal
workshop around 720 bc.
The robes of the king and his courtiers are edged with bands bearing
incised decoration representing elaborate embroidery or weaving. Some of
the motifs on these bands show winged divine heroes or goats on either side
of typically Assyrian stylised trees similar to those depicted on a larger scale

on the reliefs and also found on Assyrian seals. Another motif shows a
striding, four-winged minor god who brandishes a dagger and grasps a
sphinx by the paw; the asymmetrical composition and the palmette beneath
are typical of Babylonian seals, although the palmette also appears on
decorative Assyrian glazed plaques, and the fact that the upper wings of the
god are shorter than the lower is also typical of Assyria (in Babylonia the
wings are the same length). On cylinder seals, the presence of such a
Babylonian scene would only be expected after the capture of Babylon by
Tiglath-pileser III in 729 bc, and the palmette on the sphinx’s headdress
was once thought to be a criterion of the reign of Sargon (721-705 bc).
Finally, the motif of the divine hero between two bulls, also found on these
decorative bands, is a composition which, on seals, also only appears under
Sargon. So these tiny, barely visible details on Assyrian reliefs of the ninth
century serve to place a question-mark beside attempts to define the
chronology and geographical distribution of the seals. Nor do the reliefs
help in the dating of the furniture fillings which have been found in the
storerooms of Assyria. The same bronze sheaths with volutes appear on the
stool of Ashurnasirpal in the first half of the ninth century, on the throne of
Sennacherib at Lachish just after 701 and on the chair of Ashurbanipal’s
queen in the mid-seventh century bc.
The surviving reliefs from the throne-room of Ashurnasirpal II at
Nimrud were organised according to a carefully planned scheme. Large
figures of winged minor gods stood on either side of the doorways and of a
recessed panel at the east end of the room, behind the throne dais. This
panel shows the king twice, wearing ceremonial robes and standing on
either side of a stylised tree, sometimes referred to as the ‘Tree of Life’ or the
‘Sacred Tree’. It is also possible to view the tree as the map of a well-irrigated
garden with a main canal (the trunk) and side-channels (the branches)
watering individual plants. It was certainly a symbol of the well-being of the
country and its fertility, and it was repeated in all four corners of the room.
Syrian examples of stylised trees placed under winged sun-discs had first
appeared almost a millennium earlier, but this elaboration was new, as was
the addition of a tail to the winged sun-disc and the depiction of the god
rising from it. Behind the figures of the king are two minor deities who hold
a bucket and cone and are carrying out a protective or purification ceremony
for which there are Babylonian antecedents also going back a thousand
years. On certain occasions the king’s throne seems to have been moved so
as to be opposite one of the entrances into the throne-room, and a second
recessed panel, with a similar scene, stood against the south wall opposite
the central doorway.
On his left, when seated on the dais, the king would have seen reliefs
depicting two of his principal activities and their outcome: the hunting of
lions and bulls and the capture of foreign cities on the upper parts of the

reliefs, with, below, the pouring of libations over the dead lion and bull and
the receiving of booty and prisoners. Few of the reliefs on the northern wall
have survived, but the western half of the southern wall depicted more of
Ashurnasirpal’s campaigns. The central slab in this sequence shows the
Assyrian camp above, seen in bird’s eye view as a perfect circle. To the right
the royal horses are being groomed and soldiers are relaxing after a
successful campaign, dancing and playing ball with the heads ofdecapitated
enemies to the accompaniment of lute and harp! Below, rather more
sedately, the king receives the population of a defeated city. The action on
the four slabs on either side leads towards this central slab: on the left,
above, a successful chariot and cavalry charge, and below, the well-ordered
crossing of a river by the Assyrian army; to the right, above, the return of
victorious chariotry after the siege of a city on a hill at the extreme right, and
below, an elaborate siege scene culminating in the procession of prisoners
men, women and children - leading towards the central slab. In each
episode, the king is shown playing an active part and is accompanied by the
sun god in his winged disc.
There is nothing tentative about the arrangement of the throne-room of
Ashurnasirpal II. Holly Pittman has recently argued that it was not the
execution of a new concept, rather the revival of a decorative scheme used in
Middle Assyrian times but probably executed in glazed bricks, fragments of
which survive (see page 117). Glazed brick decoration was certainly used in
Babylonia and huge panels have been restored in Berlin. Glazed bricks were
also used by Ashurnasirpal and it is instructive to compare the scene on Fig.

105 with that on a glazed brick (Fig. 109) and on an ivory panel (Fig. no)
which, judging by details of the dress and border, is probably a century or
more later and well illustrates the difficulties in attempting to cross-date
Assyrian material from one medium to another. The stone reliefs were
painted, but little trace remains on the slabs in the British Museum. The
sandals of some of the larger figures and the end of the standing king's bow
still retain traces of red - perhaps because the lower parts of the reliefs had to
be repainted more frequently due to wear and the cleaning of the adjacent
109 opposite Glazed brick showing the king holding a bow and a cup between two attendants, one with a towel and the other with sword, bow and quiver. They are wearing rosette-patterned robes and stand under an awning; behind them is a helmeted soldier. Beneath and on the upper edge of the brick are guilloche borders.

floor. Reliefs excavated at Nimrud in the 1950s show that the beards and
hair were painted black, as were the rims and pupils of the eyes; the whites of
the eyes were painted white, and gold jewellery was picked out in yellow.
Some of the demons on seventh-century sculpture have red ruffs. As his
reconstructions indicate, Layard evidently thought that the reliefs were
entirely covered with paint, but it seems more likely that certain features
were given prominence in this way.
The slabs are carved in low relief with the background cut away around 105
the figures so as to define them sharply. The effect of volume is produced by 108
rounding certain forms, for instance the eyes, noses and chins of the figures,
the eyes of the horses and the calf muscles of soldiers and minor gods which
are stylised into perfect tear-drop shapes. The foreleg muscles of animals are
marked by an inverted U. Certain pictorial conventions of the Assyrians
have somewhat odd results: for instance, an archer will not be shown with
the arrow at eye level because it would cut across his eye, thus diminishing
his effectiveness, and so it is shown at shoulder level. For the same reason
the bow and bow-string are not allowed to cut across the archer’s face. Two
solutions to the problem were therefore adopted, and both are already found
under Ashurnasirpal 11: either one bow-string was omitted so that it appears 111
to pass behind the archer’s head and, when released, would have decapi
tated him, or the archer is shown according to a double perspective so that it
seems as though he is being viewed from the front, except that the position of
the bow and his hands can only make sense if he is seen from the back. The
two solutions may even be combined. 115
The impression of movement is conveyed by depicting consecutive
actions as taking place simultaneously: for instance on Fig. ma chariot is
shown riding down a wounded enemy archer who has two arrows in his
back, and probably the same figure is shown under the horse’s hooves with
his bow and quiver lying beside him (see also Figs 35a, 119, 146a and 174,
where two chronologically separate moments are combined in one scene). A
vulture flying above the chariot points one wing forward towards the field of
battle, where there will be rich pickings. In all the scenes of battle depicted
for over three centuries on Assyrian reliefs, no Assyrian is ever shown
wounded or at a disadvantage.
In their reliefs, the Assyrians produced some of the finest artistic creations
of all time. They were not, however, as successful with sculpture in the
round and, after several attempts in the ninth century BC, seem largely to
have abandoned it; at any rate, little survives. One of the most famous
examples shows Ashurnasirpal II, presented strictly frontally. He seems 112
barely to emerge from the block of stone from which he was carved, and
when he is viewed from the side it is clear that the sculptor conceived the
statue as two reliefs back to back. The king nevertheless has a grim
monumentality despite his small size.
136



Great Empires: the ist millennium BC
12 More successful were the huge human-headed, eagle-winged lion and
113 bull figures which guarded the doorways into the main rooms of Assyrian
186 palaces (exceptionally, lions guarded the entrance of the Ishtar Temple at
Nimrud). Some were cast in bronze, but those that survive were carved
from slabs deep enough to accommodate the width of the animal; one side
remained uncarved as it was let into the wall. The head, worked almost
entirely in the round, emerged from the end of the slab, and the body was
carved in high relief. Under Ashurnasirpal the guardian figures were
monoliths about 3.3 metres high, but those of Sargon’s reign were over 4.4
metres, and under Esarhaddon (680-669 BC) they became so large (about
5.7 m high) that they had to be made of several blocks of stone fitted
180 together. Moving such figures was a major feat of engineering. Their
monumentality contrasts with the detailed carving: beards, moustaches and
hair are elaborately curled, feathers delicately incised, and the winged,
human-headed lions have intricately knotted bands around their bodies.
During the ninth and eighth centuries bc, the figures had five legs so that
they would have the full complement whether they were viewed from the

Two Assyrians in a chariot pursue fleeing enemies while a bird of prey hovers expectantly overhead. Compare this 9th-century chariot with that on Fig. 121, some two centuries later. The chariot was drawn by two horses with the third as an outrigger or reserve horse. The remains of the band of cuneiform which divided the two registers can be seen at the bottom. About 865 bc.

112 Statue in the round of King Ashurnasirpal II, identified by an inscription below his beard. He wears ceremonial robes as on Fig. 108, but without the headdress, and holds a mace and a small sickle-sword. Layard found the statue in 1850 in the Ishtar Temple at Nimrud. It had been toppled from a block of red limestone in which it had originally been set, and both were broken. The block itself must have had a special significance: it is crudely shaped, although the Assyrian stonemasons were certainly capable of producing right angles, and may have been inherited from an earlier period.

Between the legs there is a long cuneiform inscription, and roughly scratched on the plinth is a grid for the Game of Twenty Squares (a descendant of the game played at Ur, see p. 68), probably incised by guards or those wailing to gain admittance. On a separate block behind the bull is a winged protective deity with bucket and cone, similar to those on Fig. 108 but with his head turned outwards. About 710 bc. Mosul marble (gypsum). Hi 4.42 m.
side or from the front, but from the reign of Sennacherib onwards the extra
180 front leg, when viewed from the side, was dispensed with, and this was also
143 the version adopted by the Achaemenid Persians at Persepolis. In many
cases the stone thresholds between these gigantic figures were carved with
114 intricate patterns which probably imitated carpets. In Sennacherib’s palace
at Nineveh, a sequence of doorways was described by Layard {Nineveh and
Babylon, London 1853, p. 445) as follows:
There were thus three magnificent portals, one behind the other, each
formed by winged bulls facing the same way. . . ; the largest colossi,
those in front, being 18 feet high [5.4 m], and the smallest, those

leading into the inner chamber, about 12 [3.6 m]. It would be difficult
to conceive any interior architectural arrangement more imposing
than this triple group of gigantic forms as seen in perspective. . . .
The Black Obelisk and the Balawat Gates are the main surviving monu- 10-11
ments of Ashurnasirpal’s successor, Shalmaneser III (858-824 bc). The
gates (together with two smaller sets of gates from the reign of Ashurnasir- 1
pal) were found at a small site near Nimrud, where there was a palace and a
temple to Mamu, god of dreams. Tablets inform us that the gates were made
of fragrant cedar wood; they were hung on huge cedar-wood trunks capped
with bronze and turning in stone sockets. Each gate was decorated with
eight bronze bands approximately 27 centimetres high, and each bronze
band was embossed and chased with two friezes representing, in fascinating
detail, Shalmaneser’s campaigns during the first ten years of his reign,
identified by cuneiform inscriptions. The friezes were edged with rows of
rosettes which held the nails fastening the bands to the gates. The sequence
of the bands can to some extent be deduced from the diameter of the ends
which were wrapped around the trunk; the trunk tapered towards the top
and these upper bands were also the least well preserved because they were
nearest the surface of the mound. The height of the gates can be estimated at
140



Great Empires: the tst millennium BC
6.8 metres thanks to the discoloration, at regular intervals, of the inscribed
vertical bands which edged the gates.
1 One of the scenes on the Balawat Gates shows a sculptor executing a relief
at the source of the Tigris which can still faintly be seen in situ. It is of a type
well known from actual examples, both free-standing (e.g. wa 118805)and
carved on strategic rock faces during Assyrian campaigns, generally within a
round-topped frame. The king is shown pointing with one finger towards
the symbols of the gods, in the same way as on the niched reliefs in the
108 throne-room of Ashurnasirpal II, and he wears the same ceremonial robes.
This scene was accompanied by a long inscription. Similar sculptures were
executed under successive kings and would have been the type of monu
ment most frequently seen by the peoples of the Assyrian empire (one is
depicted in the royal gardens on Fig. 8). They encapsulated the ideal of the
power vested in the monarch by the gods and were a permanent record of his
achievements on their behalf.
115 The next king to leave a pictorial record of his campaigns in the form of
relief sculpture was Tiglath-pileser III (r. 744-727 bc). The sculptures and
their division into registers by bands of inscriptions were much as they had
been under Ashurnasirpal II, but the grid-like decoration of textiles seems
to have been an innovation of the period. Whether the textiles were woven or
embroidered or whether metal plaques were stitched to the cloth is uncer
tain, but it has been suggested that the Phrygians of western and central
Turkey may have been responsible for instigating this fashion; certainly in

Assyrian archers behind body shields are shown besieging a city on a hill with a scaling-ladder and a battering-ram aimed at a corner tower. 1'he capture is also depicted (another instance of sequential actions being shown as simultaneous), and inhabitants are being butchered and impaled. Below are the remains of the cuneiform inscription which divided the registers. Note the partial omission of the bow-string, arrow and body-shield and the archer’s twisted posture. About 730 bc. lit 91 cm.



Ancient Near Eastern Art
Phrygia decoration in grids of squares was also applied to painted pottery
and to architecture.
Like his famous predecessor Sargon of Akkad in the third millennium bc
(see Chapter 2), Sargon II (r. 721-705 bc) was probably a usurper and
adopted the name Sharru-kinu (‘True King’) on his accession. He founded a
new capital, Dur Sharrukin (now Khorsabad), some distance north-east of
Nineveh, and built a great palace there which he decorated with reliefs and
gateway figures on a huge scale. His slabs are characterised by a higher,
more rounded relief and a greater interest in landscape. Most of the slabs
excavated are in the Louvre, but the British Museum has a pair of colossal
winged bulls, a slab showing Sargon and a high official, probably the crown
prince, and a fine hunting scene which decorated the king’s private apart- 116
ments.
The division of slabs into registers was abandoned for some of the scenes
in Sargon’s palace and this innovation was developed under his successor,
Sennacherib (r. 704-681 bc), who moved the capital to Nineveh. Here he
built a palace on the south-western part of the mound of Kuyunjik which
came to be known as the ‘Palace without a rival’. Vast courtyards were
surrounded by suites of rooms, most of them lined with reliefs depicting
Sennacherib’s campaigns. The most important of these were entered
through doorways lined with colossal human-headed lions or bulls, and the
sequence of doorways described above led to the famous Lachish Room
(Room xxxvi) where the reliefs depicted a single episode from Sen
nacherib's third campaign.
Lachish was a town in southern Judah, on the borders with Egypt.
Sennacherib hoped to conquer Egypt, and his campaign against Hezekiah’s
kingdom of Judah in 701 BC was a preliminary to that conquest. The
Egyptians, at that time ruled by a Nubian dynasty, dispatched an army to
the aid of the Judaeans. The campaign is described by Sennacherib in his
annals and, from the Judaean point of view, in the Bible (II Kings 18-19
and Isaiah 36-7). The reliefs of Sennacherib’s time are distinctive in that the
geographical background is generally indicated, for instance date-palms for
Babylonia and, in the case of Lachish, a scale pattern overall to show hilly
country, planted with vines and fig-trees. In order to give the impression of
the implacable advance of rank upon rank of Assyrian troops, on some of the
slabs these are arranged in horizontal rows reminiscent of registers: slingers,
archers from different parts of the empire, identified by differences in dress,
and then, as they near the tell on which towers the city of Lachish, archers
behind huge body-shields and spearmen in more active postures, holding
round wickerwork shields.
The siege itself must have been visible through the doorway. Before the 7
city the Assyrians have raised a huge siege mound upon which they have laid
ten ramps of dovetailed boards. Siege engines are inching their way up these
142



Great Empires: the 1st millennium BC
but the Lachishites are hurling stones and burning torches onto them; in
order to prevent their catching fire, one of the men in each engine ladles
water onto its battering ram and leather exterior. The siege mound can still
be seen at the site of Lachish itself: it is aimed at a point in the defences where
it would have been difficult for the besieged to concentrate large numbers of
defenders. On the relief the siege ramps are shown fanning out, but in reality
the siege engines would have advanced side by side, forming a protective
wall behind which Assyrian troops could move forward. From a postern
gate, already surrounded by Assyrians, the elderly, women and children are
being evacuated past the bodies of impaled spies.
To the right of the city the aftermath of its capture is depicted: processions
of Assyrians with booty and Lachishites going into exile with their posses
sions loaded onto camels and into carts, the children witnessing, as they
pass, two men spread-eagled on the ground who are being flayed alive.
These processions are divided, as were the attacking Assyrians on the left of
the city, into horizontal rows, and are moving in the same direction.

117 opposite Detail of a relief from Room xxxvi of the SouthWest Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh. Sennacherib sits on his throne, the arm-rest and seat of which are supported by figures of minor deities, made of gilded bronze or ivory (see Fig. 132); his feet rest on a footstool. He holds two arrows (probably a symbol of victory, see Figs too and 136d) and a bow; army officers, led by the crown-prince, approach. The scale-patterned background indicates the hilly Judaean countryside. Sennacherib's face was smashed at the lime of the sack of Nineveh in 612 bc when the palace was looted and burnt. About 700 bc. Hi of whole relief 2.65 cm.
The culmination of all this movement towards the right is Sennacherib 117
himself, seated on his throne at the centre of the end wall of the room; an
accompanying inscription identifies him and provides the name of the city.
Kneeling prisoners plead for mercy, while others move forward and some
are executed. These curly-haired prisoners are dressed differently from the
Judaeans with their fringed kilts and turbans and it is possible that they are
Nubian members of the garrison; furthermore, the captured chariot with its
elaborate yoke which is being brought out of Lachish may well be Nubian,
since Nubian horses and chariotrv were renowned.
The king sits at the top of one of the hills near Lachish and immediately
behind him (and identified by a caption) lies his tent, built to an interesting
design which would have caught the prevailing breeze and channelled it
through the tent; the same principle was later adopted for the iwan type of
architecture made famous by the Sasanians for their palaces and adapted
under Islam for mosques, palaces and schools. Other tents of this type,
together with more traditional ones, are shown in the fortified Assyrian
camp, seen from above on the side wall to the right. From the camp the
movement is towards the king on his throne. His chariot awaits him at the
bottom of the hill and soldiers with horses stand in attendance behind.
Nearer the camp is another chariot of different type: the closest parallels for
it are chariots on the reliefs of Ashurnasirpal H’s reign and it was perhaps a
vehicle for state occasions in the same way as carriages from the last century
are used on state occasions by present-day royal families. Inside the camp,
priests perform a ritual over a war-chariot in which stand divine symbols.
This sequence of reliefs has been described in detail because it serves to
show the information which a careful study of Assyrian reliefs can provide.
The dress of the Judaean Lachishites and Nubians, of the various regiments
of the Assyrian army, of the crown-prince and king, is carefully rendered
and although the figures may be stereotyped, they can, for that reason, be
easily recognised when they reappear. For instance, after they went into
exile, the Judaeans seem to have been employed in construction work
related to the building of Sennacherib’s palace: another sequence of reliefs 180
in Court VI of the same palace depicts the moving of the huge bull-colossi
from the quarry, and men wearing the same distinctive fringed turbans as
the Judaeans are shown working there and hauling on the ropes. A famous
slab (wa 124947) shows curly-haired, long-robed men, similar to the
Nubians on the Lachish reliefs; they play lyres decorated with the heads of
ducks or geese, and actual lyres of this type have been found in Egypt.
Because these figures have often, and wrongly, been identified as Judaeans,
the relief has been used to illustrate Psalm 137 which was written by later
exiles from Judah and begins: ‘By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept
when we remembered Zion. There on the poplars we hung our harps, for
there our captors asked us for songs.’
144



Great Empires: the ist millennium BC
The reliefs in Sennacherib’s palace are remarkable on many counts. The
scale is huge (the reliefs in Room xxxvi were 2.65 metres high) but the
scenes, filled with small figures and rarely divided into registers, are
carefully composed and were conceived specifically for the room or court
yard where they were found, sometimes - as in Court vi - as part of an
enormous composition 40 metres long. The high quality of the carving is
remarkably consistent. There are idiosyncrasies, such as in Room xxxvm
where a river runs through the scene and the trees below it are shown upside
down. That different craftsmen were used, even on one and the same slab,
becomes apparent upon close examination: for instance the slab forming the
corner to the left of the enthroned Sennacherib in Room xxxvi depicts
Nubians in procession with, on one side of the corner, their curly hair shown
as little circles and on the other, by a grid of lines.
145



Ancient Near Eastern Art
118 Detail of Fig. 119, the Battle of Til Tuba.
Many of the reliefs were badly damaged when the palace was sacked and
burnt in 612 bc and the Assyrian empire collapsed before the combined
onslaught ofChaldaeans from Babylonia and Medes from Iran. The gypsum
from which most of the reliefs were carved turned to plaster of Paris when
burnt; other slabs are fire-blackened where burning rafters collapsed against
them. The upper parts of the reliefs suffered particularly badly, since they
were either shattered when the burning roofs collapsed or were left exposed
and were badly damaged by the rain and frost of northern Iraqi winters.
Unfortunately, it was generally on the upper parts of the reliefs that the
captions were placed and these have often disappeared. As a result, although
- thanks to the identifying background - the general area of a campaign is
usually clear, the specific cities depicted are seldom known. However,
whereas the upper parts of the side walls of the Lachish Room had crumbled
away, the relatively narrow end wall is better preserved and one of the
corners survives to its full height. Those who looted and burnt down the
palace could not resist disfiguring the face of Sennacherib whenever they
came across his likeness - either on his throne, as in the Lachish Room, or,
more often, supervising activities from his parasol-shaded chariot. Larger
inscriptions on the backs of the slabs are as follows:
Palace of Sennacherib,
great King, King of the world,
King of Assyria, the almighty one,
the Lord of all kings.
Not all the rooms in Sennacherib’s palace had been carved with reliefs
at the time of his death. In some cases the blank slabs were decorated
with scenes illustrating the campaigns of later kings, notably those of
Sennacherib’s grandson, Ashurbanipal (r. 668-627 bc). Sometimes, Sen
nacherib’s reliefs were usurped, the surface was cut back and another relief
was carved instead. This process is well illustrated by a relief which had
been part of a cycle showing a campaign in marshy territory, perhaps in
southern Babylonia; the reed beds still survive on the left but they have been
cut away on the right of the slab, which has been recut with a scene showing
a fleeing horseman and advancing Assyrian infantry against a background of
palm-trees by a river (wa 124773). Other rooms had been left undecorated
on purpose because they had been lined with a special type of fossiliferous
limestone covered with distinctive elongated while flecks; the Assyrians
called it pindu stone and it came from Mount Nipur (Cudi Dag in south
eastern Turkey).
One of these rooms, Room xxxi 11, was taken over by Ashurbanipal, who 118-1
had a sequence of slabs - six of which survive - decorated with episodes of a
campaign against the Elamites and Chaldaeans, probably around 650 BC.
The harder stone enabled these reliefs to survive better than most. The

Battle of Til Tuba, or of the River Ulai, is well known from texts, from
another sequence in Ashurbanipal’s North Palace (carved on a different
stone), from the captions on the reliefs themselves, and from tablets
recording the captions which enable uncaptioned scenes to be identified.
Numerous episodes are illustrated among the apparent confusion of the
Elamite defeat. The Elamites are characterised by their shorter hair and
beards, by head-bands worn knotted at the back, and by the fact that they
are the recipients of everything unpleasant. On the left (not shown), the
Elamites are driven from Til Tuba, a strategic elevation which they had
held. The Elamite king, Teumman, is identified by his crown with a long
feather hanging down the back, by his fringed and ornamented robe and his
laced boots. He has been wounded in the back by an arrow and, together
with his son, Tammaritu, he flees from the battlefield in a chariot. As they
drive through a wood, the chariot overturns and they are thrown from it;
Teumman’s crown falls off and reveals his equally distinctive receding
hairline. Tammaritu rescues the crown and urges his father to flee on foot,
saying ‘Come on, don’t delay’. However, ‘with the help of the deities Ashur
and Ishtar’, they are surrounded; Tammaritu attempts to make a stand but
is hit on the head with a mace and they are beheaded ‘one in front of the
other’. Soldiers retrieve Teumman’s head and crown, and a scene shows
Elamite dignitaries identifying the head as that of their king. Then, as the
battle continues and the Elamites are driven into the River Ulai, which is
choked with their bodies ‘for three days’, the head of Teumman is rushed by
chariot to Ashurbanipal, who was in the northern Assyrian city of Erbil.
On the next sequence of slabs (wa 124802) the head reappears hanging
round the neck of Dunanu, a Chaldaean captive, in a scene where Teum
man’s Chaldaean allies are being tortured. This is witnessed by the ambas
sadors Teumman had sent to Ashurbanipal, bearing tablets inscribed with
an insulting message which had led to the fateful campaign, and by
ambassadors from Urartu, to the north of Assyria; the Elamites are being
made to show them the tablets in an attempt to dissuade Urartu from
following the example of Elam. Ashurbanipal (face damaged as usual)
stands in his chariot to the right. Below, Teumman’s royal city, Madaktu, is
shown, encircled by a river and canal; it consists of a citadel and a walled city
surrounded by palm-groves and country houses. The people of Madaktu
emerge from the city, singing, clapping, ululating and playing different
types of harps. They have come to greet their new king, an Elamite refugee
at the Assyrian court named Ummanigash, who is led firmly by the wrist by
an Assyrian official. In another scene, Chaldaeans are being forced to grind
up the exhumed bones of their father.
The head of Teumman makes a final appearance on the ‘Garden Party’ 120
relief from Ashurbanipal’s North Palace, which includes one of the very rare
examples of the representation of an Assyrian queen. The king and his
ESO



Great Empires: the I st millennium bc
queen are relaxing in a screened-off garden near Nineveh, fanned by
eunuchs and court ladies who, on other slabs in the sequence known from
drawings and fragments, are shown bringing food and accompanying the
banquet with harps, a lyre, drums, pipes and a lute; high-ranking Elamites
are also forced by highly amused young Assyrians to wail on the king. The
queen sits on a throne which is a simplified version of Sennacherib’s in the
117 Lachish Room. She wears a crown like a castle decorated with towers and
crenellations, and a richly ornamented, fringed dress; her elegantly slip
pered feet rest on a footstool. In her left hand she holds a bunch of flowers
similar to the tight little bunches of jasmine still made today, and in her right
hand she raises a metal cup decorated with gadroons, of a type well known
from actual examples. The king, also richly dressed, reclines on a couch,
one elbow rests on a bolster and a rug covers him. This is the earliest
securely dated example of the reclining banquet, which the Greeks and
Romans adopted from the east and which was to become a symbol oforiental
decadence. The couch is ornamented with leaping and reclining lions and
with panels resembling the ‘woman at the window’ ivories (see page 160).
The king, too, holds a bunch of flowers and raises a cup (damaged, as are
both royal faces - see also Fig. 117). His bow, quiver and sword rest on a
table nearby and a thick necklace of Egyptian type - perhaps symbolising
his conquest of Egypt - is suspended from the bed-head. Onions(?), a small
tripod vessel (probably of stone) and a box (probably of ivory) stand on a
cloth-covered table beside the couch. At either end of the couch stand
incense burners which, like the flowers, were probably a necessary precau
tion because, among the birds and cicadas that fill the trees, there hangs the
head of Teumman.

Ancient Near Eastern Art
Although Ashurbanipal seems to have entrusted the conduct of his
campaigns to his generals, he was by no means content to relax in the
company of his queen. Another sequence of reliefs shows the king taking
part in the royal hunt. In Chapter i we saw how hunting lions became the
royal prerogative and a symbol of the king’s care for his country. The king
depicted on the White Obelisk (see page 117) and Ashurnasirpal II seem to
have revived the practice. Ashurbanipal sent his huntsmen out to trap lions
and bring them back to the Nineveh zoo where, presumably drugged and
docile, they are depicted wandering around among cypresses overgrown
with vines, and date-palms at the foot of which grow daisies, lilies and other
plants, while priests play lyres and harps (wa 118914-6). When the time
comes for the royal hunt, however, all this changes. The king’s equipment is
carefully checked to see that the arrows are straight and the bows properly
strung. Spare bow-strings and finger- and wrist-guards are provided. The
bow is handed to the king as he stands in his chariot in a royal enclosure,
while an attendant restrains one horse and two other attendants back the
second horse into the traces, one of them grasping it by the ear. With the
king in the cab are the driver, holding the reins, and two attendants, one of
whom steadies one of the huge metal-studded, eight-spoked wheels, while
the other takes charge of two spears. Spare horses are brought into the royal
enclosure by young men. The rich ornamentation of the king’s dress, his
jewellery and the details of the horses’ harness are beautifully rendered, but
more impressive still is the portrayal of the high-spirited horses with rolling
eyes and flaring nostrils, the bells on their harnesses surely ringing as they
toss their heads.
Screened off from the royal enclosure and protected from any danger by
rows of spearmen with shields and hunting-dogs with their armed handlers,
the people of Nineveh are climbing to the top of a mound (on which stands a
royal kiosk decorated with a relief showing a lion hunt), in order to find a
good vantage point from which to watch the proceedings; some carry their
picnics with them. Then the hunt starts.
The lions have been caged and attendants retreat into small protective
cages above as they release them. Mounted beaters drive the lions towards
the king, whose initial sweep across the hunting ground is not depicted .But 14
his return is shown as, with his bow and arrows, he finishes off wounded 121
lions and lionesses. Arrows fly. One lion leaps towards the chariot but the
two attendants hold it at bay with their spears: it is clear that they are not
allowed to kill the lion, for this is the king’s prerogative. In the next scene the
lion has leapt onto the axle and is almost in the cab but the king turns and
dispatches it with his dagger. Another wounded lion grasps a wheel of the
chariot in its paws and sinks its teeth into it; as the wheel turns the lion is
lifted off the ground and the king hands his bow to his attendant, seizes his
spear and kills it.

Dead and dying animals strew the hunting ground; they drag their
paralysed hindquarters, vomit blood, seek to push aside arrows with their
paws and writhe in their death-throes. The sculptor shows far more
sympathy for these royal beasts than for defeated and tortured human
enemies. Paradoxically, the impossibly contorted postures of the lions and
the stylised rendering of their muscles and fur seem to emphasise the realism
of the scene. Yet the purpose ofall this carnage is not only to show the king’s
prowess with various weapons, but to make an offering to the gods: the dead
lions are laid out side by side before an offering table and the king pours a
libation over the bodies as musicians play and other attendants stagger in
with more lions.
The great lion hunt which has just been described is but one of many
hunting scenes. The king is shown on smaller, equally finely cut reliefs
divided into registers and, in one case, modelled in higher relief in clay
(wa 9301 i). Dressed in special richly decorated royal robes, which are
122-3 sometimes hitched up in front, he hunts on horseback and on foot; he grasps
a lion by the tail and twists it round; fallow deer are trapped in a netted
enclosure and shot; the king lies in wait in a hide and shoots at a herd of
gazelle; onagers are chased by hunting dogs and shot; and on one occasion
the king saves some Elamite vassals from an attacking lion. In many cases
the king’s face has been purposely damaged, but sometimes his features

curling lip. This impassivity contrasts with the hectic action which the artist
has succeeded in conveying.
Some of the Assyrian reliefs just described rank, without doubt, among
the outstanding works of art of all time. The stone from which they were
carved came for the most part from local outcrops of gypsum known as
Mosul marble, which is dazzling white when first cut. The reliefs are
therefore restricted to the Assyrian cities round Mosul: Nimrud, Khorsabad
and Nineveh. Ashur, to the south, had no reliefs, it seems, while in
Babylonia repetitive designs were produced on mould-made glazed bricks:
rows of lions, bulls, mushhushshu dragons, rosettes, decorative borders with
palmettes and, behind the king’s throne, a huge composition with a row of
columns topped by triple proto-ionic capitals, executed in white, yellow and
pale blue on a rich, deep blue background. The contrast with the scenes
depicted around the Assyrian throne is striking. The accidents of discovery
discussed in Chapter 1 have resulted in much of the material from Babylon
now being in Berlin.
North-west of the Assyrian heartland, the Aramaean inhabitants of the
town of Guzana (now Tell Halaf) in the early ninth century bc adorned the
palace of their king, Kapara, with small, crude but lively reliefs carved from 124
rough-textured limestone painted red, alternating with black basalt. Unlike
the Assyrian reliefs, where the design runs on from slab to slab, the Tell
Halaf reliefs each show a complete scene. The same interest in colour
contrast is found further west at Carchemish, at the crossing of the
Euphrates on the Syrian-Turkish border, where slabs were carved in
alternating black basalt and ochre (probably originally white) limestone.
This predilection for colour contrasts in building materials continued to be a
feature of Syrian mosque and palace architecture in Islamic times and was
exported by Syrian architects working, for instance, in Konya and Cairo.
Other Syrian sites produced sculptured slabs in local Neo-Hittite or Ara
maean styles, or in Assyrian styles. At the Assyrian provincial palace at Til
Barsip, on the Euphrates south of Carchemish, the French excavators
discovered remarkable wall-paintings with scenes comparable with those on
the Assyrian reliefs. The predominant colours were white, black, red and
blue, with outlines and detailing in black. Experts are still divided as to
which paintings belong to the reign ofTiglath-pileser HI and which to those
of later kings.
The reliefs from Carchemish are more sophisticated that those from Tell
Halaf but they, too, generally show one subject per slab. They indicate
continuity with the traditions of the Hittite empire, which collapsed around
1200 bc, but also build on the art of Syria. Several rulers were responsible
for decorating the public buildings and processional ways of their city with
sculptures. Limestone and basalt slabs with mythical scenes, forming the
156



Great Empires: the 1st millennium bc
so-called ‘Herald’s Wall’, date to around 900 bc. Each displays a three
figure composition, generally with two deities or mythical creatures attack
ing a victim between them; such compositions had appeared on Middle
Assyrian seals of the thirteenth to twelfth centuries BC but here they are
successfully transposed to a monumental scale. Each composition is com
plete in itself; there is not the directional dynamism of later Assyrian reliefs.
The ‘Long Wall of Sculpture’ was decorated around the same time with
processions of gods, chariots driven over the bodies of enemies and rows of
foot-soldiers on slabs of alternating colours. Ashurnasirpal II would have
seen these reliefs when he visited the city in 870 BC, and they seem to have
been the direct inspiration for the decoration of his own palace at Nimrud. A
125 remarkable series of basalt reliefs on the ‘Royal Buttress’ depicts the Hittite
royal family around 800 BC, identified by inscriptions in the decorative
hieroglyphic Hittite script; in marked contrast to the practice in Assyria, the
queen and all the young princes are depicted, including a baby and a
toddler. Later reliefs show Assyrian influence, and Carchemish finally came
under direct Assyrian domination in 717 bc.
Some of the slabs from Tell Halaf show animals and monsters with
distinctive markings; similar markings also appear on ivories and metal
work: a flame pattern on the haunch, a notched line along the back with

triangles indicating lhe fur under the belly, a group of lines - sometimes in a
box - for lhe ribs, and a feature described as ‘resembling an open peapod
near the hock’. The ivories have recently been studied, simultaneously and
completely independently, by Georgina Herrmann and Irene Winter, the
two foremost scholars in the field of ivory studies. Both agree that the ivories
probably dale to the early ninth century bc, but whereas Herrmann
maintains that her ‘Flame and Frond’ group first appeared in Tell Halaf,
Winter argues for a Carchemish origin.
This highlights the difficulties of attributing groups of stylistically related
ivories to geographical areas except in the broadest sense. The closest in
style and subject matter to the Assyrian reliefs are flat ivory panels with no
decoration incised or, occasionally, in low relief. They were presumably
made in Assyrian workshops, although not necessarily by Assyrians, and
lhe presence of bronze nails and nail-holes indicates that the ivories were
fixed to pieces of furniture or to square or rectangular boxes. In Syria there
seems to have been a greater use of the hollow sections of the tusks, which
were made into small round boxes with their sides carved in high relief with
little figures hunting, feasting and playing musical instruments; the propor
tions are squat, with elaborate and stylised patterning of the surfaces. The
solid tips of the tusks were often shaped into nude female figures, either
singly or in groups of up to four, back to back, forming the handles for
mirrors, fans or fly-whisks. Flat panels were also carved in Syrian style for
bed-heads or throne-backs, and continue a tradition dating back to the
second millennium bc when similar panels were, it seems, made in Ugarit
on the north Syrian coast; they combine local and Egyptian motifs, includ

ing a Neo-Hittite form - with volutes - of the Egyptian winged disc (e.g.
wa 132692).
Other ivories have cut-out shapes which were originally filled with
coloured glass inlays, indicating that in this case ivory and glass workshops
must have co-operated. The presence of predominantly Egyptian motifs in
ivories of this group indicates a western origin, with Samaria (the capital of
the kingdom of Israel) and Arslan Tash (south of Carchemish) both being
plausibly suggested as centres of manufacture. This latter site was probably
the place of origin of a group of ivories known as the ‘woman at the window’
(wa 118155-9) showing the face of a woman, wearing an Egyptian wig,
looking over a balcony supported by a balustrade of little columns with
palmette and volute capitals; the whole is set within a triple frame with
tenons for fitting the plaque into a piece of furniture (as shown on Ashur
banipal’s couch). In some cases, a strip of light greenish glass inlaid over
gold foil at the bottom provides the earliest evidence for the gold-glass
technique.
The most sophisticated ivories, however, are those in Phoenician style, 127-8
either made by Phoenician craftsmen working in Assyria, or plundered
from Phoenician centres along the Levantine coast. They incorporate
Egyptian motifs, which are sometimes treated in a somewhat cavalier
fashion; for instance, in an openwork ivory plaque depicting a striding 181
sphinx among stylised flowers the double Egyptian crown on the sphinx’s
head has been so abbreviated in order to fit it into the space available that it is
scarcely recognisable.
In addition to the types of ivories just described, there are many decorated
ivory wands, knobs, combs, gaming pieces and strips. Little reclining
calves, of which several are products of the ‘Flame and Frond’ workshop
discussed above, decorated the edges of trays and the lids of boxes.
Elements of furniture include lions in the round, lions’ feet and bulls’ feet,
elegantly curved legs or arm-rests, palmettes and volutes. Many items of the
harness and trappings of horses were made of ivory, while others were made
of metal; they were often given as royal gifts together with horses and
chariots, but they were also items of trade and booty and their places of
manufacture are difficult to identify. Although several of the ivories are
inscribed on the back, the inscriptions consist either of fitters’ marks or the
name of the place from which they were looted (which does not necessarily
mean they were made there). Although the vast majority of ivories were
found in the storerooms of the Assyrian palaces, especially at Nimrud,
significant numbers were also found, as already mentioned, at Samaria and
Arslan Tash, at Salamis in Cyprus, in Urartu to the north ofAssyria and - in
a distinctive local style - at Hasanlu in north-western Iran.
The surviving ivories were found in palaces, temples and rich burials,
thus indicating the value placed on these luxury objects; many of the finest
160



Great Empires: the ist millennium bc
were found in wells at Nimrud into which they had probably been thrown,
for later retrieval, at the time of the fall of Assyria in 612 bc. The material
used in the first millennium bc was elephant ivory, rather than the
hippopotamus ivory which was favoured in the second millennium. There
has been much debate as to where the ivory came from. There were
elephants in the marshes of lhe Orontes valley and the Lake Jabul area south
of Aleppo, but only for limited periods and probably, therefore, imported;
the suggestion that there was a native pygmy Syrian elephant can be
discounted. Whether the imported elephants came from Africa or India
cannot be ascertained, as both types of ivory age in the same way. In the
reign of Seleucus I (305-281 bc), war elephants were imported from India
and stabled at Apamea on the Orontes, and it is tempting to suggest that this
was the revival of an earlier trade; certainly it is an Indian elephant which is
10 depicted on the Black Obelisk. The rarity of the material made ivories a
highly prized commodity although, paradoxically, it seems that they were
often gilded so that the ivory would not have been visible; they were also
coloured and some were fire-blackened, probably intentionally. They
became a symbol of ungodly luxury and decadence and were condemned in
the Bible (e.g. Amos 3:15 and 6:4).
Forming another related category of luxury object were the large tri
dachna shells incised with a variety of designs adapted to their shape (e.g.
wa 117999). These were often Egyptianising and sometimes the hinge of the
shell was shaped like a siren head reminiscent of the handle attachments of
large cauldrons, the fashion for which spread throughout the Mediterranean
at this time (e.g. wa 22494).
Metal bowls were another type of artefact manufactured primarily in the
west. Many bronze bowls, some of them inlaid with silver studs, were found
in the Assyrian palace storerooms. The designs incised on them came from a
variety of sources; some are Syrian with rows of animals surrounding a
central geometric motif (e.g. WAN.l), and some are again based on
129 Egyptian motifs, or combine both types. A particularly fine example of the
latter, made of gold, has been found in one of the unlooted tombs of
Assyrian queens discovered by Iraqi archaeologists at Nimrud from 1988
onwards. The jewellery these burials contained has been a revelation
because very little has survived the pillaging of the Assyrian palaces at the
time of the fall of the Assyrian empire and knowledge of jewellery was
therefore hitherto based on depictions on the reliefs. An openwork crown
decorated with rosettes and winged figures in a trellis ofgold vines with lapis
lazuli grapes is particularly startling. Previously, one of the most spectacular
130 items of jewellery known from the period had been a Phoenician gold
bracelet or diadem found at Tharros in Sardinia. Many fragments of gold
votive jewellery of the eighth to seventh centuries BC were found in the
excavations of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, together with fibulae

Lycians in central and western Turkey had a thriving culture influenced by
their Greek neighbours, but the British Museum has few objects from these
areas which date to the first half of the first millennium BC. Such is not the
case, however, with regard to eastern Turkey.
Metal furniture fittings have already been mentioned, together with the
difficulty of assigning them to specific workshops. One group, however, was
certainly made to the north of Assyria, in the kingdom of Urartu. This

Great Empires: the I st millennium BC
highland area does not seem to have had a well-defined political identity
until the Assyrian threat caused the clans to unite and establish a dynasty
131 ruling from Tushba (now Van) on Lake Van. The kingdom - known in the
Bible as Ararat - extended across the borders of modern Turkey, eastwards
into Iran and northwards into the Republic of Armenia. The Urartians built
impressive fortresses, with beautiful ashlar masonry, to guard the mountain
passes into their kingdom and the strategic sites within it; the model of one
survives (wa 91177). Although they sought inspiration from the long
established cultures of their neighbours, the Urartians combined these
influences into a distinctive art of their own. The presence of rich mineral
deposits in eastern Turkey provided impetus for a lively metalworking
industry; Urartian products are of a particularly good quality and were
highly prized by the Assyrians, who carried off huge quantities of booty
from Urartian sites, notably from Musasir, in a mountainous frontier region
now in north-eastern Iraq. This city was sacked by Sargon II of Assyria
16 during his eighth campaign in 714 bc; drawings of reliefs showing the
destruction of the city survive, as does the king’s own detailed account:

of Assyria, Urartu and Habhu’ - an indication of the problems facing us
when we attempt geographical attributions of objects - and large quantities
of arms. Descriptions of statues cast in bronze provide some indication of
the treasures which have been melted down over the millennia and are now
lost. They include ‘a statue of Rusa with his two horses and charioteer, and
its pedestal, all cast in bronze’.
The citadel at Van dominates a fertile plain beside the lake; nearby, on
another rock outcrop known as Toprakkale, stand the remains of the citadel 131
of Rusahinili, reached by a rock-cut stairway and artificial tunnel. Within
the citadel was a temple to the god Haldi. Attention was first drawn to the
site when bronzes appeared on the market in the 1870s and Layard obtained
some of them for the British Museum; others are in museums in St
Petersburg, Paris, Berlin and New York, and in private collections. In 1880,
with Layard’s encouragement, summary excavations were carried out on
behalf of the British Museum by two foreign residents in Van, Dr Raynolds
and Captain Clayton, briefly supervised by Rassam. As a result the British
Museum has a rich collection of objects from the temple, including the
customary lions’ feet, palmettes and volutes from several pieces of bronze
furniture dating to around 700 bc, one of which was a throne. As in the case
of the throne of Sennacherib, the seat and arm-rests would have been

now missing - would have been made of ivory, and there would have been
inlays of glass and semi-precious stones. A small reclining bull (wa 91248)
133 was probably part of a matching footstool. An inlaid bronze upright, now
twisted out of shape, was topped by a reclining lion with open jaws and
bulls’ hooves; it may have been an arm-rest.
Several shields were found at Toprakkale and, as we know from the
drawing of the temple at Musasir and from Sargon’s description, they were
hung on the temple walls. They are decorated with concentric circles of
embossed and chased lions and bulls arranged in such a way that they
change base-line in each quadrant so that none is ever upside-down
(wa 22481); this is a distinctively Urartian arrangement. Large cauldrons
on tripods would have stood outside the temple (according to the same
drawing) and the handle of one ofthese, in the shape of a winged bull’s head,
shows a distinctive fringe of curled hair hanging down between the bull’s
eyes (wa 91242). Similar attachments were exported and copied all over the
Mediterranean world.
Broad metal belts were also popular throughout the Near East and
beyond during the first millennium bc, and a large number have been found
in Urartu. One type has an elaborate pattern of monsters of a sort not

One last type of Urartian artefact deserves some comment. With their
country under snow for half the year, the Urartians had to be able to store
large quantities of oil, cereals and wine. Their storerooms contained huge
jars capable of holding up to 1,200 litres each. The manufacture and firing of
these jars was a considerable feat which the the makers of the burial jars at
Yortan (see Chapter 2) and the Hittites had already mastered centuries

before. The contents of the wine jars were removed by means of round, red
burnished jugs: a small room next to the wine cellars at Karmir Blur
contained 1,036 of these (wa 132902) and some were brought back from
Toprakkale (WA 135748-9).
Although many of the features of these bronzes, for instance the inverted
133 U-shaped muscles or the stepped decoration on the lion’s nose, are found in
the art of Urartu’s neighbours, they are combined in a way which makes
them unmistakably Urartian. If the Urartian lion’s head is compared with
134 that from Sippar in Babylonia or with some of the lions from Ashurbanipal’s
123 lion hunt, or with Assyrian bronze lion-shaped weights (e.g. wa 91220), it
becomes clear that although the conventional patterning is much the same
on all four examples, in Babylonia and Assyria it is applied over the
underlying rippling muscles, to emphasise them, whereas in the case of the
lion from Urartu the patterning replaces muscles. This is true of all the
Urartian bronzes: the basic shape of the figure is overlaid with patterned
dress or curly mane and stylised lines indicating the muscles, but there are
no inner dynamics. The Urartian bronzes are static, the lion is frozen in a
permanent roar. It was perhaps this Urartian disregard for the underlying
167

anatomy of their figures that enabled them to create such fanciful and
anatomically impossible creatures. Even the Babylonian mushhushshu seems
plausible compared with the monsters on the belts and on the cylinder seals, 136f
which look as though they would overbalance very easily.
The stone-carving tradition of the second-millennium kudurru continued
into the first, but generally in the form of small tablets. One particularly fine 135
example, together with its impressions in clay, was buried in a clay box in
the foundations of the temple of Shamash at Sippar. Another, dating from
the same reign, records the gift of an estate by Nabu-apla-iddina to an
official who is his namesake (wa 90922). The king is shown on the right,
wearing the Babylonian style of dress already worn in the eleventh century
by Marduk-nadin-ahhe, with a fringe round the hem, pleats at the back, and 100
a belt around the waist and diagonally across the torso. (This type of dress
seems to have been adopted at Carchemish by the adult members of the 125
royal family.) Above, as on a kudurru, are the symbols of various deities.
Round-topped stelae (wa 90864-6) record the building works by King
Ashurbanipal and his brother Shamash-shum-ukin, king of Babylon; they
were deliberately archaising and recall the reliefs and foundation figurines of
the third millennium bc showing the king as a builder. Another round- 61
topped stele (wa 90837), which probably dates to the reign of Nabonidus
(555-539 BC) shows a god facing right, which is unusual, with his hand
raised in blessing. His robe is fringed and patterned in the style normally
adopted by Babylonian deities, and he holds a staff. Before him are the
moon, sun and star symbols. The inscription on the back records the return
of plenty after a drought.
These reliefs give a meagre impression of Babylonian art, but the seals 136a
produced by the Babylonians show that they had a remarkable mastery of
the techniques of cutting semi-precious stones. Cutting-wheels were used to
carve friezes of animals in pursuit of each other which are far more lively
than the equivalent scenes from Assyria, which were executed in a softer
stone (serpentinite) in a linear technique: Another favourite subject shows a
hero holding a sickle-sword behind him in his lowered right hand while he
grapples with a lion, griffin or some other monster; sometimes he rests his
foot on an animal which he is protecting, thus forming a triangular scene
reminiscent of those on Middle Assyrian seals. Typically Babylonian, at
least on seals, are the little plants at the end of a scene. During the second
half of the eighth century bc, this asymmetrical composition became a more
symmetrical one by the addition of a figure.
It is probable that the revolution in Assyrian seal-cutting during the 136c
second half of the eighth century bc was due to the importing of Babylonian
craftsmen and techniques after the capture of Babylon in 729. Thereafter it
is difficult to differentiate the seals of the two regions, but in Babylonia
minor gods have four wings of equal length whereas in Assyria the lower

wings are longer and the composition is more often strictly symmetrical.
There are some spectacular seals from this period, some perhaps the
product of a single Assyrian workshop active during the reign of Sargon,
from about 720 bc. However, as an indication of the difficulty of dating
artefacts at this period, it should be pointed out that the seal in Fig. I36d has
recently been dated a whole century earlier by one authority.
Although formal inscriptions were still written in cuneiform, Aramaic
written in an alphabetic script on a perishable material - was increasingly
being used, particularly in the west. The parchment and papyrus rolls were
I36e sealed with small lumps of clay for which a stamp seal was more suitable. In
B6f Syria, as in Urartu, the stamp-cylinder was often used when a dual
administration was in force, and the Assyrian royal administration used
stamp seals from the second half of the ninth century bc onwards (e.g.
wa 84672). The design on these royal seals was always the same, although
size, borders and details might vary: the king is shown grasping the mane of
a rearing lion and stabbing it; similar scenes appear on Ashurbanipal’s
123 reliefs and, later, on those of the Achaemenid Persians at Persepolis.
Much of Assyrian and Babylonian religion consisted of magical spells and
rituals invoking the aid of protective demons. Amulets and fibulae bear the
likeness of a particularly unprepossessing demon, Pazuzu, who protected



Ancient Near Eastern Art
women in childbirth from the attacks of a female demon, Lamashtu; the
latter is lion-headed, with a female torso and the legs of a vulture, and she
stands on a mule, suckling a boar and a dog at her empty breasts (e.g.
wa 117759). In contrast, there is a charming Syrian figurine from Car
chemish: a woman wearing an elaborate hat holds a baby ( wa 108757). Clay
protective figures of minor deities and guardian dogs were buried under the
floors of Assyrian palaces, especially near doorways. Many Babylonian
objects would also have been modelled in terracotta, but few have survived.
One such object is the head and forepaws of a somewhat crude but lively
even bouncy - lion (or dog?) with rather different markings from those
discussed above, and with huge staring eyes (wa 22458).
More sophisticated are the figures made of Egyptian Blue, a sintered
mixture of quartz and a silicate of copper and calcium. A fragmentary
figure, found by Layard in the temple of Ninurta at Nimrud, depicts a
frontal, four-winged minor goddess with arms extended (wa N.475). The
same material was used for small bottles, but more common were the glazed
faience bottles, patterned with yellow and green leaves, made by a related
technique (e.g. wa 135188). The thriving glass industry of the second
millennium BC seems virtually to have disappeared during the dark age and
only reappeared in the eighth century bc. Vessels were often cast (blown 139
glass was not invented until the first century BC).
Meanwhile, north-east and east of Assyria there had been, and continued
to be, large-scale population movements. Weapons and a variety of other
grave-goods, including numerous amulets, have been found in tombs on
both sides ofthe Caucasus mountains. Bronze belts and axes were also found 137,14(
as grave-goods in tombs in north-western Iran and in Luristan in western
Iran; as these were generally looted, the dating is equally uncertain but is
generally taken to range from the eleventh to the eighth centuries BC.
The Luristan graves supplied the antiquities market with a large number
of bronzes from the 1920s onwards. Because an object from Luristan was
likely to fetch a high price, artefacts were said to have come from there when
they had actually originated elsewhere in Iran or even further afield, and
many forgeries were made in the ‘Luristan’ style. At its best, Luristan
metalwork is of excellent quality; age-old subjects such as the ‘Master of
Animals’ and lions attacking horned animals are combined in a lively, 138
abbreviated manner. Many of the bronzes were whetstone handles or horse
trappings, including horse-bits with ornamented cheekpieces; one gives yet
another variation on the theme of the human-headed, winged bull
(wa 130677). Pins with decorated heads may have been dedicated in
shrines. From Baba Jan, one of the few excavated sites in Luristan, came 176
tiles which decorated the ceiling of a large columned room of the eighth
century bc (e.g. wa 135755). The designs are all variations on the square
and cross, and a similar motif appears on pottery. A group of metal drinking 141

cups with representations of animals or feasting dignitaries and musicians
presents yet another dating problem (wa 134734). Details of the dress and
decoration would indicate an eighth-century date, but some of these vessels
were inscribed in antiquity with the names of Babylonian kings of the tenth
century (and one perhaps belonging to the eleventh). Either these inscrip
tions were copied onto the vessels to give them added prestige, or the
iconographic details they display have been dated too late.
‘Amlash’, south-west of the Caspian Sea, is another dealer’s provenance.

vessels shaped like bulls, stags or zebus (wa i 32974), with the head forming
the spout, appeal - by their simplicity and satisfying volumes - to present
day taste and there are consequently many forgeries. A bronze cup shaped
like an hour-glass, with an incised kneeling man, a lion, a hare, a bird and
numerous gazelles in two registers, could be as early as the fourteenth
century BC or as late as the eighth (WA 134685).
A third major dealer’s provenance is ‘Ziwiye’, where a rich burial was
discovered in about 1946; the body and grave-goods were in a bronze coffin
of Assyrian type which can be dated to around 700 BC. So many objects have
been attributed to this burial that they would have filled several coffins and it
is now impossible to isolate those which were genuinely associated with it.
Some are decorated with animals resembling those of the so-called Animal 142
Style of Central Asia, more particularly of the Scythians who made their
appearance in the history of the Near East at this time and were to play an
increasingly important part in political events during the first millennium
BC: for instance, a gold strip is edged with birds’ heads, and hollows for inlay
alternate with strange, embryonic lions with distinctive heart-shaped ears
(wa 134383-4).
Little is known about the identity of the various groups whose artefacts we
have just examined. It is certain, however, that even before the dark age
Indo-Aryan tribes had been entering Iran (the word Iran means ‘Land of the
176



Great Empires: the 1st millennium bc
Aryans’). Among these tribes were the Medes and the Persians, and
eventually the two rival dynasties became united through marriage. It was
the Medes, allied with the Babylonians, who, in 614 and then again in
612 BC, swept through Assyria, destroying its cities and bringing that great
empire to its knees. And it was the Persian king Cyrus the Great who
captured Babylon in 539 bc, thus bringing to an end the Neo-Babylonian
empire, whose greatest king had been Nebuchadnezzar II (604-562 bc).
The Medes are first mentioned in Assyrian records of the ninth century
BC, and in the seventh century bc they made Ecbatana (modern Hamadan)
their capital. The material culture of the Medes remains elusive: a Median
site excavated at Tepe Nush-i Jan, just south of Hamadan, produced
impressive architecture but very few artefacts. The most important find was
a bronze bowl containing 231 silver objects, some of which are now in the
British Museum (wa 135072-85). They were probably buried between 650
and 575 BC but, unfortunately for the history of Median art, the bowl was
plain and the objects consisted of double spiral pendants and quadruple
beads which could have been made as much as 1,500 years earlier, a plain
bracelet, plain spiral rings of a type known from the third millennium
onwards, bar ingots, and scrap silver in various forms. A single earring
made of hollow balls soldered together, with granulation filling the inter
stices, was the only distinctive object dating approximately to the time of
burial.
However, when the Persians under Cyrus the Great (r. 550-530 bc)
gained ascendancy over the Medes, they inherited the territories already
under Median rule and set out on a series ofconquests which eventually gave
them control of an empire stretching from the Indus to the Nile and brought
them into conflict with the Greeks, first in western Turkey and then in
Greece itself. The Achaemenid Persians - as they are known, after a
legendary ancestor, Achaemenes - used materials and employed workmen
from all over their empire to create a distinctive imperial style and build
their great cities - first at Pasargadae in the province of Fars, then at Susa
143 and Hamadan and at that most Persian of sites, Persepolis. Bricks were
made by Babylonians, cedar wood came from the Lebanon, andyaka timber
was brought from Gandhara and Carmania; gold from Sardis in the west and
Bactria in the east was worked by Medes and Egyptians (who also ‘adorned’
the walls); lapis lazuli and carnelian came from Sogdiana, turquoise and
other stones from Chorasmia, silver and ebony from Egypt, and ivory from
Ethiopia, Sind and Arachosia. The stone was quarried near Persepolis but
was worked by lonians and Lydians from western Turkey. When they
returned to their homes, these craftsmen carried the new style with them
and it was adopted, with local variations, throughout the Near East.
Persepolis was one of the first sites to attract the attention of western
travellers. On a huge terrace cut into the natural rock, Darius the Great

(r. 521-486 bc) and his successors built a whole series of palaces, columned
halls and storerooms, reached by monumental stairways. The mud-brick
superstructures have vanished, but lhe soaring columns on massive bases,
with huge double bull- or griffin-capitals, the carved doorways, window
frames and facades of fine-grained, grey limestone still make a tremendous
impact on lhe viewer. The stairways to various buildings - and in particular
those to the Apadana, a typically Persian type of building-were carved with
reliefs showing the peoples of lhe empire bringing their tribute and gifts to
lhe king’s treasury; several fragments of these were brought to England at
lhe beginning of the nineteenth century. Figures are shown in true profile
and not the twisted profile that has appeared so far in this book. It is
probable that this innovation was introduced from Ionia by the stonemasons
and sculptors employed at Persepolis. The scenes are carved in low relief,
but the relief appears higher than in Assyria because the edges are more
rounded and lhe background was cut back evenly and not predominantly
round the figures.
There is no doubt that the Achaemenid kings had aimed to outdo the
Assyrians: there are human-headed winged bulls 6 metres high, built - as
were the largest Assyrian bulls - of separate blocks. The king fighting a lion

decorates one of the doorways into the Hall of One Hundred Columns.
Subject peoples support items of furniture - as they did in Assyria - but
these are now huge stools and beds on which the king sits under a canopy or
stands before an altar. The whole produces an impression of immutable
power - a reflection in stone of the phrase ‘the law of the Medes and Persians
which cannot be broken’ (Daniel 6:8). The long processions of figures
derive their sense of direction from repetition, not from the representation
of movement. Even the scenes of combat - the king fighting lions or
monsters, or lions attacking bulls - are static royal icons, frozen in time.

(in imitation of Babylonian practice and probably executed by Babylonians)
in the Palace of Darius at Susa. It has been demonstrated that these figures
were designed according to a strict canon of proportions based on a unit
corresponding to the height of a brick, namely 8.5 centimetres. The
technique employed to make these huge panels was extremely complex and
required three firings: the first, of the undecorated moulded bricks, the
second to fix the threads of thick glaze to form separate compartments for
the colours, and the third to fix the colours themselves. The glaze was a
siliceous vitreous fluid coloured by lead antimony, copper, ferrous man
ganese and tin to produce various shades of yellow, blue, green, black,
brown and white. The figures wear robes decorated with a variety of motifs:
four-petalled rosettes in squares, stars in circles, or crenellated castles in
squares.
6a-b The Persians did not only excel in monumental sculpture. Although the
stamp seal was widely used, the royal administration reverted to the use of
cylinder seals. The seals are beautifully cut with very fine tools and they
show the same eclectic choice of motifs transformed into something dis
tinctively Achaemenid. The coffin in a looted tomb at Ur was found to
contain some 200 little pieces of clay of no interest to the thieves, bearing the
146c impressions of cylinder seals, stamp seals, seal-rings, metalwork and coins.
The deceased may have been a collector or jeweller. The coin impressions
have enabled the group to be fairly closely dated and most of the seals must
belong to the latter part of the fifth century bc. Some of the impressions are
of early Greek seals, some are Egyptianising, some are Achaemenid and
i46d some are Graeco-Persian. However, the greenstone scarab seals from a
variety of Phoenician sites, including Tharros on Sardinia, make greater use
of Egyptian and Levantine motifs.
When they moved west in search of new markets for their goods, the
Phoenicians not only carried with them the techniques and iconography
which had been developed in the Levant over the centuries; they also took
the knowledge of the alphabet which was adopted by the Greeks (see
Chapter 1) and by the inhabitants of the colonies they founded in the west.
These Punic colonists (as they are known) gradually developed a distinct
culture but did not forget their Levantine origins. Some of the customs they
brought with them were not as laudable as the alphabet: the practice of child
sacrifice was roundly condemned in the Bible but it seems to have survived
far longer in the west. In the tophet or burial place at Carthage, just outside
present-day Tunis, many child and animal cremations have been excavated.
The position of the urns was indicated by decorated and inscribed votive
stelae, many of which are in the British Museum (see page 37).

The Achaemenids also built on the metalworking traditions of their
148 predecessors and produced beautiful metal drinking horns and bowls. One
silver bowl is decorated with gadroons alternating with applied gold Bes
headed winged lions; a similar bowl, made of gold, was part of the famous
Oxus Treasure (wa 123919) which was found by chance in 1877, probably
at Takht-i Kubad on the banks of the Oxus. It was then taken to India for
sale, but on the way the merchants were robbed. Most of the treasure was
recovered by a British political officer, Captain F. C. Burton, as the bandits
were dividing it up. The grateful merchants allowed Burton to purchase one
of a spectacular pair of armlets which is now on loan to the British Museum
from the Victoria and Albert Museum. The remainder of the treasure was
sold in Rawalpindi where it was acquired by Major-General Sir Alexander
Cunningham; he sold it to Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks who bequeathed
it to the British Museum in 1897.

The objects that make up the Oxus Treasure are of various origins and
dates, but it is not clear whether a hoard of coins (which might date the
deposit) was originally part of it or not. The treasure seems to have been a
votive deposit in a temple, which was subsequently moved and buried at
some time of political upheaval. Some of the objects are Achaemenid.
149 Among these are the gold bowl and armlets already mentioned, a silver
handle shaped like a leaping ibex, a gold jug, a silver dish and two gold
model chariots (one fragmentary). There was a fine gold scabbard (unfor
tunately cut up by the bandits), the shape of which is identical to that of
short swords depicted on the Persepolis reliefs. It is decorated with scenes
from a lion hunt which owed much to Assyrian inspiration; the border,
however, consists of Animal Style birds’ heads not unlike those on the gold
strip from Ziwiye (see page 176), and there are other examples of this
150 Central Asian style. Some of the objects show Greek influence, notably a
solid silver statuette of a naked man wearing a gilded helmet. There were
human and animal heads, and figures in the round, embossed discs, rings,
seals, bracelets and amulets - all of which could have been dedicated in a
temple. The most convincing argument in favour of a votive destination for

these figures are also depicted in true profile.
Among the diversity of objects in the Oxus Treasure, those in
Achaemenid style are unmistakable. It was the Persians’ great achievement
to have taken elements from the disparate cultures of their huge empire and
to have forged them, within a single generation, into a distinctive imperial
style. In this they were repeating the feat of the Akkadians almost two
millennia earlier, and using art as an instrument of royal propaganda with
the message ‘this is Akkadian’ or ‘this is Achaemenid’, still recognisable
today.

n 334 bc Alexander the Great crossed the Hellespont and the Achae
menid empire collapsed. Alexander died in 323 bc but the impact he
had on the world he had conquered, extending from Greece to the borders of
India, was out of all proportion to the brevity of his life. He had encouraged
his soldiers to marry foreign wives and settle in the east, and although they
absorbed eastern ways they brought with them new ideas, new methods and
techniques, and where they went, their craftsmen followed. The inter
change of ideas, which had begun in Achaemenid times but had then been
restricted to an elite, suddenly exploded into the new and vigorous culture
which we call Hellenism, and influenced all aspects of life.
One of Alexander’s generals, Seleucus (r. 312-281 bc), gained control of
most of the Near East although he and his descendants had to fight for the
western provinces which were claimed by the descendants of another
general, Ptolemy, who controlled Egypt. These western provinces became
part of the Greek and Roman world: their local religions and traditions were
absorbed and converted, and the art produced in those regions belongs in 151-2
another book.
The kings of the Seleucid dynasty were called Seleucus or Antiochus, and
they gave their names to various cities called Seleucia and Antioch or, after
two of their wives, Laodicea and Apamea. Their capital was established at
Seleucia-on-the-Tigris, south-east of modern Baghdad, and Susa was re
founded as Seleucia-on-the-Eulaios. At this latter site W. K. Loftus found
an alabaster statuette of a woman wearing Greek dress. Another was
excavated by Hormuzd Rassam at Borsippa, near Babylon. Although in 153

Details such as the border of her cloak and lhe ornament she wears round her neck have been added in plaster, and traces of paint survive. The use of pigment to give prominence to the eyes is particularly Near Eastern (cf. Fig. 43). By analogy with terracottas from Seleucia-on-theTigris, it seems that the object below her right hand is a crescent attached to her cloak: she may have been a priestess of the moon goddess Artemis - a transposition of the age-old tradition of royal priestesses of the moon god at Ur (see p. 74). 3rd century BC-2nd century’ ad.

concept such figures are Greek, in execution they are very much in the local
idiom and illustrate the marriage of east and west which took place at this
time.
Hellenism, and the changes it brought about, were resisted by the
traditionalists, particularly when religious practices were affected by the
new ideas or syncretisms. The traditional cultures of the east reasserted
themselves under the Parthian (or Arsacid) dynasty. The Parthians were
Iranian nomads from Central Asia who, under Arsaces, had by 238 BC
seized control of the old Achaemenid satrapy of Parthia, east of the Caspian
Sea, and set up their capital at Nysa as a royal city. Within a century they had
154 gained control of Seleucia-on-the-Tigris and founded Ctesiphon on the
opposite bank of the river. The Euphrates became their frontier with Rome,
but the Parthians’ control of the Silk Route brought them into contact with

the Han dynasty in China. Caravan cities such as Hatra just west of lhe
Tigris near Ashur, Dura Europos on the Euphrates and Palmyra in the
Syrian Desert passed the trade westwards towards Rome, and grew rich
from the proceeds. The art of these cities is heavily influenced by both
eastern and western traditions. In 53 and 36 BC respectively, the Roman
armies under Crassus and Mark Antony were no match for the Parthians
and their mounted archers, who could turn in lhe saddle and shoot their
small bows - the famous ‘Parthian shot’. In ad 116, however, Trajan was
briefly able to capture Ctesiphon, and from then on Parthian power
declined.
During the first two centuries of their dominance the originally nomadic
Parthians had continued to be strongly influenced by Hellenism, but 156
thereafter a new spirit of independence appears in such works as the large
bronze statue from Shami in western Iran (now in the Iran Bastam Museum
in Tehran). This reaction against Hellenism is reflected in Parthian coinage:
the coins of earlier kings have affinities with the products of Hellenistic
mints, but later dynasts are shown wearing Parthian tiaras and their coins
are executed in a flatter, less modelled and more linear style, although for
the most part the inscriptions continue to be in Greek.
The Parthians revived the tradition of carving rock reliefs at the same sites
used by the Achaemenid Persians and, before them, lhe inhabitants of
western Iran and the Zagros in the late third and early second millennia bc.
The figures on Parthian reliefs often wear their hair in a distinctive fashion,
in huge bunches on either side of their faces, and they are strictly frontal.
Because of this frontality, although the viewer is made to participate in the
scene, there is no communication between the figures within the composi
tion and the result is remarkably static. The introduction of frontality,
which marked a break with previous Near Eastern tradition (see page 76),
had important repercussions: it continued into Sasanian times and was
adopted into Byzantine art.
At Hatra stone statues and reliefs of the gods dating mostly to the second 158
century ad have been found in the temples, and local adaptations of Greek
gods were popular. The merchants and priests of Hatra, and occasionally
the women, had statues of themselves set up in their temples. The posture is
still strictly frontal and the figures raise one hand stiffly, but they are richly
attired.

Although the figure has been identified as Athar, god of fire, or as Herakles, it probably depicts Hermes, the Greek messenger of the gods, or his local counterpart. He is nude apart from a diadem with ribbons and a cloak; he seems to have wings on his head and ankles and he holds a bag in one hand and a staff (?) over his shoulder. Although frontality had often been used for the heads of male nude figures, the lower part of the body had always been shown in profile (e.g. Fig. 593-0). Late 2nd-early 3rd century ad. I It 30.4 cm.

Later, the iwan became a basic element in Islamic architecture.
There was a Parthian settlement on the site of the old Assyrian capital of
Nineveh, and a lintel from there was brought back by George Smith in 1874. 155
The elongation of the monsters on it is also found on bronze artefacts, and 157
similar animals are depicted on the belt carved on a statue from Hatra,
towards the end of the period of Parthian domination. The Hatra statues
display a wide range of ornamental belt buckles and pins, and actual
examples have survived. The survival of such artefacts reflects the Par- 159
thians’ nomadic origins, where such portable items emphasised the status of
the wearer. Belt-clasps of the first to second century ad from Georgia are 162
another manifestation of this same fashion.
Jewellery, such as that found in Parthian tombs at Nineveh, although also 16C
much worn by nomads, is a status symbol of universal impact. Turquoise
and garnet inlay was popular in the east, as demonstrated by the spectacular
burials of this period excavated by the Russians at Tillya Tepe in
Afghanistan, and the fashion seems to have spread.
Terracottas can sometimes be identified as Parthian because of the dress
worn by the figures depicted. Some of these, from Uruk, show a man

showing two musicians (wa 91917) - found in the burial vaults, as well as
architectural fragments and figured capitals from a Parthian building (e.g.
wa 92219, 92231).

of strict frontality were adopted. The monuments set up by the rich
Palmyrenes reflect a growing awareness of their Near Eastern roots. In the
third century ad a local dynasty gained a considerable degree of autonomy.
Finally, under their famous queen Zenobia, Palmyrene troops wrested
control of Syria from the Romans, conquered Egypt and embarked on the
conquest of Asia Minor (now Turkey). The Romans eventually reacted,
defeated the Palmyrenes, captured Zenobia and took her to Rome, where
she appeared in their Triumph wearing golden chains.
This dominance of women in Palmyra, though contrary to the general
198



trend in the Near East, is reflected in their tomb monuments. The dead were
buried in elaborate tomb-towers in a valley nearby. The main tomb was
hollowed out of the rock and the head of the family was shown in high relief,
reclining at a banquet, holding a cup. The other occupants were buried in
long stone slots and identified by portrait busts at one end. These show
165 proud and domineering women dressed in their finest jewels, which still
bear traces of the paint which once highlighted them. By contrast, however,
most of the men look timid and brow-beaten. The emphasis on portraiture
and the use of the bust are both heavily influenced by Rome.

To the south, beyond the frontiers of the Parthian empire, the kingdoms
of Arabia, particularly in what is now Yemen, grew rich through trade in
spices with the Roman empire. The art they developed owes something to
Rome but is extremely distinctive. A local alabaster was used for sculptures
of both men and women set up in temples, and for votive and funeral 166
plaques. Part of a bronze altar decorated with projecting bulls’ heads on the 169
side, three rows of sphinxes shown frontally, and a long dedicatory inscrip
tion in the South Arabian script naming the god Rhmw (wa 135323-4) is
remarkable more as a technical tour de force than as an artistic chef d’oeuvre.
Where smaller bronzes are concerned, however, we are left in no doubt as to 167-1
the bronzesmiths’ versatility and skill.

west, Alani nomads to the north-west and the rise of the Kushans in the east.
However, it was one of their own governors, Ardashir, who ruled Fars from
Istakhr just north of Persepolis, who finally overthrew the last Parthian
king, Artabanus V. Ardashir (r. ad 224-40) set up the Sasanian dynasty
(ad 224-651), called after one of his ancestors who claimed descent from the
last Achaemenid king. The Sasanians, therefore, aimed to revive the glories
of the Achaemenid empire; Zoroastrianism, which had been widespread in
Achaemenid times, was made the state religion. Sasanian territorial ambi
tions brought them into conflict with Rome, and Shapur I (r. ad 240-72)
170 defeated no less than three Roman emperors: Gordian III, Philip the Arab
and Valerian. Shapur depicted these defeats in numerous reliefs, in a
conscious echo of that of the Achaemenid king Darius I at Bisitun.

Rock reliefs continued to be carved by successive Sasanian rulers and in
their variety and detail they are an important source of information. The
kings can be identified thanks to their royal headdresses, which change from
reign to reign and which are also shown on their coins. Often they are
70 depicted frontally; frequently they are on horseback, surrounded by their
courtiers, who are identified by their crests and are all mounted on richly
caparisoned horses. Some of the earliest drawings of these reliefs, and

19 certainly the first accurate ones, were made by Sir Robert Ker Porter.
Among the latest reliefs are lively hunting scenes which take place in royal
parks known as paridaiza (the origin of our word ‘paradise’): one of them is a
boar hunt in marshland to the accompaniment of music; it is in marked
contrast to the Assyrian reliefs showing Babylonian enemies being hunted
down and killed in the marshes of southern Iraq.
Sculpture in the round has rarely survived. However, there is a huge
statue, almost to metres high, of King Shapur I, carved from a stalagmite in
a funerary cave near Bishapur in Iran. On a smaller scale is a bronze figure in
171 the British Museum.
Gold and silver vessels were made in large quantities, and for decades
193 they have been a popular item for forgers to copy. Many techniques were
172 used: some were incised, some embossed and chased, often with hunting
174 scenes. One of the latter depicts a stag hunt with the curve of the stag’s body
following that of the bowl and its eyes mournfully raised skywards in
counterpoint to the king’s stern but impassive expression. The movement
implied by the stag’s leaping into the picture and the king having presum
ably jumped onto its back, is also indicated by the fluttering of the light
material of the king’s pleated tunic and trousers, and by the wind-blowm

bows on his headdress, around his beard, streaming out behind him, and
even on his shoes; but it is belied by lhe king’s static posture, vertical at the
centre of the design.
In other cases some areas of the design were executed in repousse on
separate sheets of metal and applied to the vessel; these raised areas have
often become damaged or have broken away. Such is the case with a bowl
which was acquired in Rawalpindi and probably made in the eastern part of
the Sasanian empire in the late fourth century AD (wa i 24093). It depicts an
official being invested with the ring of office by a king; the latter is shown
frontally, seated on a throne supported by griffins. Round the edges, the

king is shown again, semi-reclining on a couch, surrounded by his courtiers
and musicians. A similar technique was used in the execution of silver and
173 gilded bottles, although an example in the British Museum is embossed, or
perhaps even cast.
175 Finally, another very fine silver bowl, with the design inscribed in a
patterned circle and picked out in gold, shows a mythical creature, generally
identified as the senmurv mentioned in the texts, with the foreparts of a dog
19 or lion, wings, and a peacock’s tail. This creature, again inscribed in a circle,
176 appears on Sasanian textiles and on representations of them, on a stucco
plaque, on wall-paintings, on glass vessels and on a Sasanian seal

(wa 120341). It was also adopted into Islamic and Byzantine iconography.
The adaptation of a motif to various materials and uses, regardless of scale, is
a feature of Sasanian art. A bronze in lhe British Museum (which may be
post-Sasanian) shows a composite creature related to the senmurv with the
fur or feathers under its neck forming a leaf pattern (wa 123267).
Sasanian seals are distinctive and represent a last flowering of the art of
seal cutting which was such an important vehicle for the transmission of
Near Eastern motifs in time and space. Many are cut on flat stones such as
almandine garnet and carnelian, which were set in rings or as pendants. 177
However, the typical Sasanian seal shape is like a finger-ring carved out of

stone, but with a hole generally much too small to have fitted on a finger and
which would therefore probably have been worn as a pendant. The sides are
sometimes decorated with raised circular facets or scroll patterns, and the
seals were carved from attractive, colourful stones such as quartzes (chal
cedony, carnelian, agate, onyx and jasper) and lapis lazuli, although
haematite, which had been so popular for cylinder seals in the first part of
the second millennium BC, also made a comeback. The bases bore portraits,
animals, flowers, allegorical and magical subjects, and devices (perhaps of
tribal origin), carved with varying degrees of competence and sometimes
surrounded by an inscription in the Pahlavi script. At their most rudimen

tary, these designs are extremely easy to copy and there are numerous
forgeries on the market. A large number of seals could be impressed
together on circular or domed cakes of clay which were shaped round the
string or strips of leather attached to goods or documents.
Sasanian pottery was often decorated with stamped designs - frequently
animals - related to some of those on the seals. A small, circular terracotta
plaque shows a lively representation of tumblers and, perhaps, weight
lifters, one of whom wears a patterned coat (wa 93028). Glass technology 178
had advanced and it was now possible to produce blown transparent vessels.
Cutting-wheels were sometimes used to execute simple linear designs but
more often to decorate lhe surface of vessels with facets.
Although under the Sasanians Zoroastrianism had become the state
religion, the incantation bowls found predominantly in southern Meso
potamia demonstrate the presence of several other religious groups and lhe
survival of many of the ancient gods and demons. These shallow bowls are
inscribed on the interior, mainly in Aramaic but also in Syriac, Mandaic and
Pahlavi, with spells to protect the owner from evil, and some are decorated
with spirited but crude representations (e.g. wa 91728).
All this changed with the introduction of a new religion: the Islamic
conquest brought about the collapse of the Sasanian empire in AD 651.
Although Islamic art inherited many of the concepts of Sasanian art, the

religious taboo on the representation of the human form - which was at
times extended to all representational art - led to a complete change in
direction. Yet many of the iconographical motifs of the previous millennia
were so deeply ingrained in the traditions of the countries of the Near East
that they survived in one form or another. Many had already been passed
eastwards and westwards and had become part of the artistic vocabulary of
other cultures. These survivals and revivals will be the subject of the next,
and last, chapter of this book.

CHAPTER 6
Survival and Revival
W
ith the advent of Islam in the seventh century ad, the Near East
enters a new religious and political era which is reflected in a new art
and architecture; the story of Ancient Near Eastern art ends and the
narrative is taken up by the Islamicists. Or does it end? A culture may
change beyond recognition but it does not die. In this chapter we shall
examine a few of the ways in which echoes still reach us of the art of the
Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians and Assyrians, Medes and Persians,
Hittites and Urartians, Canaanites, Israelites, Judaeans, Phoenicians, Par
thians and Sasanians, and many others - including a vast number of peoples
who have remained nameless.
To put the matter of survival into context, however, survivals in fields
other than art should perhaps briefly be examined. It is well known that the
alphabet was transmitted to the west by the Phoenicians; its very name
derives from its first two letters: aleph (bull; originally shaped like a frontal
bull’s head, then turned sideways in Phoenician, and finally turned once
more through ninety degrees to form our A) and beth (house; a house-plan
with entrance, again turned sideways to form our B). Several common
words have been transmitted through Greek or Arabic from Akkadian or
Sumerian, for instance cherry, alcohol, saffron, jasper, myrrh, horn, cane
and canon, lute, alkali. The Sumerians devised a sexagesimal system of
numbering whereby the basic unit was 6 and its multiples; indeed, 6 is the
lowest number which can be divided by i, 2 and 3. We have inherited from
this system our division of lhe day into 24 hours each of 60 minutes made up
of 60 seconds, and our division of a circle into 360 degrees. Tablets from Tell
Harmal and Tell ed-Dhibai near Baghdad record the existence, around
1800 bc, of what we call ‘Pythagoras’ theorem’, and methods of calculating
the areas and dimensions of squares, triangles and circles; their approxima
tion of lhe square root of 2 was still being used by Ptolemy some 2,000 years
212



Survival and Revival
later. The division of the year into months and weeks also comes from the
Near East. Astronomy and astrology were developed by the Babylonians
and transmitted to the west through the Greeks and Arabs. Many of the
constellations were given their names by the Babylonians and - in transla
tion - we still use them today. The signs of the zodiac are all present, fully
developed, on seal-ring impressions on texts dating to between 304 and
132 bc from Hellenistic Uruk. These motifs go back far further, of course,
and some are present on kudurrus and seals of the second millennium bc and
earlier, although not as part of an integrated system. Capricorn, for
instance, with its strange combination of goat and fish, is first attested on a
cylinder seal of the Ur III period just before 2000 bc.
First and foremost, the Bible kept alive the knowledge of the peoples
named above and of the art they created. (The word ‘Bible’ itself derives
from the city of Byblos on the Lebanese coast where books first replaced
scrolls.) The biblical story of the Flood, for instance, is now known to have
its Mesopotamian counterpart. Feminists may be interested to know that
the strange story of Adam’s ‘spare rib’ from which Eve was created (Genesis
2:20-3) makes perfect sense once it is realised that in Sumerian the feminine
particle and the words for rib and life are all ti, so that the tale in its original
form must have been based on Sumerian puns. The geographical location of
the Garden of Eden was Sumer (see page 10). All these stories, and many
more, have provided a rich harvest of pictorial representation throughout
the millennia, for which the original inspiration was the Ancient Near East.
The imagery of the Bible has also inspired us through the millennia. For
instance, in the Book of Revelation 4:6-8 we read of four living creatures
who surrounded the throne in heaven. ‘The first . . . was like a lion, the
second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like
a flying eagle.’ In the early Christian Church these four winged creatures
179 became the symbols of the Four Evangelists, respectively Mark, Luke,
Matthew and John. The best-known is probably the lion of St Mark, which
no visitor to Venice can miss. (In fact, it has even been suggested that the
great winged lion on a column in the Piazzetta was an antique bronze
brought back by the Venetians from the south coast of Turkey. However, it
is far more likely to be Romanesque in date and European in origin.)
The writer of Revelation based his description of the four living creatures
on the cherubim in the vision of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1, especially 1:10, and
10:14). This vision is dated to 593 or 592 bc, when Ezekiel was in exile in
Babylonia. Ezekiel would have been familiar with the imagery used in his
country of exile: if he travelled in the north he would have seen the ruins of
the great gateways of the Assyrian palaces, destroyed only twenty years
before, guarded by the colossal figures whose symbolism impressed and
inspired him); he would certainly have heard them described, possibly by
180 descendants of the Judaean prisoners captured at Lachish in 701 bc and

subsequently used to haul Sennacherib’s winged bulls into position.
As we have seen, this semi-divine creature, known as a lamassu, has the
body of a lion or bull, the wings of an eagle, and a human head; it thus
12 combines the power of the strongest wild animal (the lion), or domesticated
113 animal (the bull), with the wings of the most powerful bird in the heavens
(the eagle) and human intelligence (see Fig. 51 for an early representation of
the four together). Although lions had guarded gateways of palaces and
temples in the Near East since before 3000 bc, the Assyrians had probably
been inspired to create their huge composite Zanuzssw-figures when they saw
the smaller gateway figures of the Aramaeans and Neo-Hittites during their
campaigns in Syria. The tradition for these figures in Syria has recently been
shown to be far older than previously thought: a stele found at the site of
Ebla in northern Syria, and dating to the nineteenth century bc, shows a
similar human-headed, winged creature with the legs of a lion, horse (?),
bull and man.
It thus becomes easier to visualise the cover of the Ark of the Covenant
described in Exodus 37:7-9: *. . . two cherubim out of hammered gold at
the ends of the cover,. . . made of one piece with the cover. The cherubim
had their wings spread upwards, overshadowing the cover with them. The
cherubim faced each other, looking towards the cover.’ These would

In 1853, after his rediscovery of the Assyrians, Layard was granted the
Freedom of the City of London and the documents were presented to him in
a silver-gilt casket decorated with bull- and hon-lamassu figures and with 182
motifs taken from Assyrian reliefs. This is one of many objects inspired by
the Assyrian reliefs displayed in the British Museum and, during the Great
Exhibition of 1851, in the Crystal Palace; these included porcelain and
bronze figures and an ‘Assyrian Style’ in nineteenth-century jewellery
design.
Another descendant of the lamassu is probably the senmurv, which
combined the foreparts of a dog or lion with a peacock’s tail. According to
tradition, the flesh of the peacock did not putrefy and it therefore came to be
associated with immortality. For this reason the peacock occurs frequently
in early Christian iconography as a symbol of the Resurrection. A creature
resembling the senmurv appears in a circular frame on the Borradaile 183
Oliphant and it is probable that the motifs on this horn were taken from
Byzantine or Sasanian silks.
The motif of the senmurv was frequently woven into Sasanian textiles, 19
which were traded all over the known world. These textiles were highly
prized, and surviving pieces were used for wrapping ‘relics’ for gullible
Crusaders, in order to give them an aura of age and authenticity. The relics
of St Leu were wrapped in samite woven with senmurvs in roundels
decorated with globes - the so-called ‘pearl border’ (Paris, Musee des Arts

thirteenth century, contains fragments of seventh-century textiles, some of
which come from Central Asia and are resist-patterned using a technique
also found in China. Perhaps the most interesting example of the way
patterns travelled is a copy of a Sasanian textile in the Shoso-in at Nara in
Japan: pearl borders enclose four Japanese archers mounted on winged
horses on either side of a fruit tree resembling William Morris’s orange
trees; between the roundels is a pattern which is remarkably close to the
designs on Assyrian glazed wall plaques of the ninth century bc! Finally, the
senmurv appears on wall-paintings in a number of locations including one of
the rock-cut churches, probably of the eighth or ninth century, in the Ihlara

184 Valley (also known as the Peristrema Gorge) in central Turkey: three are
shown in patterned roundels but are interpreted as ‘cocks praising the

recalling that in the course of their destructive raid into the Holy Land in
614, the Sasanians did not destroy the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem
because the mosaic on the facade depicted the Magi wearing Persian dress!
Several royal icons still in use today owe their origins to the art of the
Ancient Near East. The first is the concept of the lion as a royal animal which
has here been traced back to representations of the ‘priest-king’ killing lions
in the late fourth millennium bc (see pages 50-1); a representation on a
painted bowl from Arpachiyah in northern Iraq may take the motif back to
around 5000 BC, but there neither the identity of the figure nor the type of
felid he is shooting can be determined. The motif of heroes and their allies
fighting lions, found on cylinder seals and on metalwork, survives on
185 Romanesque and Gothic capitals. In the first millennium bc, lions were the
symbol of royalty in the courts of Assyria, Urartu and Israel - and probably
others, including Judah, as indicated by the title ‘Lion of Judah’ in
Revelation 5:5. Nor, nowadays, is England alone in having a lion as part of
its coat of arms.

In the third millennium BC, and probably even earlier, statues of lions
were set up outside Sumerian temples, for example at al-‘Ubaid. In the
ninth century BC, gigantic lions stood at the entrance to the Ishtar Temple at 186
Nimrud. These lions symbolised protection, but in later times just the head
was sufficient guarantee. A Sasanian disc with the head of a lion probably 189
decorated a shield. However, a similar disc of bronze, said to be from Byblos
on the Lebanese coast, dating between the first and fourth century ad, had
been attached to the end of a wooden coffin as a handle, judging by the
remains of an iron ring surviving in its mouth (wa 48348); it recalls later
door-knockers, for instance one dating from around ad 1200 from Brazen
Head Farm in Essex (mla 1909,6-5,1). Appropriately, lions’ heads in

Hl 21.5 cm (Philadelphia, University Museum).
A third royal icon which has a long pedigree in the Near East is the king on
horseback. From Parthian times onwards, the king rides a special breed of
horse which has a thick arched neck and tucked-in head and seems to have 187
become popular in Achaemenid times. The horses of St Mark’s in Venice,
which may be Hellenistic or Roman, display the same features, as do those
ridden by Renaissance kings and condottieri. A further adaptation of the
motif of the royal rider, showing the mounted king spearing an animal, was 188
to become the prototype for representations of St George killing the dragon.
Finally, several earlier royal images were consciously revived by lhe Qajar
monarchs of Persia in the nineteenth century; they include the enthroned
Achaemenid king depicted on a glazed tile and a design based on those of 191
Sasanian bowls. 193
The tradition of animals behaving like humans - exemplified by Peter
Rabbit, Winnie the Pooh and others - also has a long pedigree. It goes back
via La Fontaine and Aesop to representations on Assyrian cylinder seals of
the ninth to eighth centuries BC, on a slab from the same ninth-century
palace at Tell Halaf as Fig. 124 and on Egyptian ostraca and papyri of the
thirteenth century bc. These may have been independent creations or they
may have been inspired by much earlier representations of the first half of
the third millennium bc from Iran and Iraq. One of these is a panel
decorating a lyre from Ur and dating to around 2600 bc. The theme of 192
animal musicians occurs on contemporary seals from Ur, and flute-playing
monkeys can also be found at this and many other periods. However, in
Proto-Elamite art of around 2800 bc animals replace humans entirely, and
lions and bulls are shown fighting, engaged in administrative activities, or in
boats. It was suggested in Chapter 2 that these animals may have rep
resented tribal groups; they could also be the descendants of the priests or
hunters shown wearing animal masks on prehistoric seals from the same
area of south-western Iran which, in their turn, trace their origins back to
figures such as the ‘sorcerer’ painted in the Trois Freres cave of the
Magdalenian period (c. 14,000 bc) in the Ariege in France. Of more direct
relevance, however, are the animal musicians on Romanesque church
capitals, and the folk-tale about the animal musicians of Bremen, recorded
by the brothers Grimm. It is probable that the motif was transmitted to
Europe through the intermediary of monasteries and illuminated manu
scripts.
While on the subject of music, lhe Near Eastern origin of many instru
ments should be noted. The Ur harps and lyres were discussed in Chapter 2, 50b
but it seems possible that they originated in Syria or Palestine. An instru- 53
ment which is probably a lyre, but could be a harp, was incised on stone at
Megiddo in Israel in a level dated to just before 3000 BC. Certainly both
instruments were introduced to Egypt from the Levant around 1500 BC,
together with the lute. The earliest representations of the lute are on two

motifs. Purple cloth from Tyre, made from a dye produced from the murex
shellfish, was highly prized, as was embroidered cloth from Phrygia. The
Assyrian reliefs show the elaborate motifs depicted on garments, and it is
known that textiles were often exchanged as diplomatic gifts. The textiles
have not survived, but the motifs on them were copied on pottery and
metalwork and became part of the Greek iconographic and cultural reper
toire. Among these motifs are lions, the lion-headed eagle, griffins,
sphinxes, centaurs, stylised trees of oriental inspiration, hydras, mermaids,
mermen, and monsters with heads like that of the demon Humbaba, which
148 were then conflated with the Egyptian god Bes to form further creatures
such as Gorgons. Sometimes whole compositions were lifted: the killing of
Humbaba by Gilgamesh and Enkidu was simplified to become Perseus
killing Medusa; the hero between two lions or monsters reappears in
185 countless variations. Most then went on to be reproduced on the capitals and
misereres of Romanesque and Gothic churches and in medieval manu
scripts.
Henri Frankfort stated that ‘while Egypt invented plant design, Meso
potamia subjected the animal kingdom to art’ (CylinderSeals, London 1939,
p. 309). However, he also pointed out that it was the Near Eastern version of
Egyptian floral patterns which was taken over by the Greeks, and it was the
Near Eastern stylisation of animals to form well-balanced compositions,
designs and patterns, which caused them to retain their appeal through
many reinterpretations in time and space.

Mesopotamian Chronology by C. B. F. Walker
The following pages give an overview of the principal sources and data on which the chronology of Mesopotamia is based. They follow the scheme and chronology given in J. A. Brink man’s appendix, ‘Mesopotamian chronology of the historical period’, in the second edition of A. L. Oppenheim’s Ancient Mesopotamia, Chicago 1977, pp. 335-48, which is used as a convenient point of reference by most Assyriologists and Mesopotamian archaeologists active today. As Brinkman himself has remarked, ‘Mesopotamian chronology is not a very predictable field’. Some adjustments must be expected to the apparently precise chronology pre sented here as new evidence becomes available and old evi dence is reassessed. For instance, there is a growing consensus that the reign of 42 years attributed to Ashurbanipal by an inscription of the time of Nabonidus may be an exaggeration and that his reign may have ended as early as 631 bc. The fundamental framework for chronology, at least back to 1430 BC, is provided by a combination of Ptolemy’s Canon (c. ad 150), which was probably based on Babylonian eclipse records, and by the Assyrian king-lists. Surviving Babylonian astronomical records indicate the accuracy of Ptolemy’s Canon, and a solar eclipse recorded in the eponymy of BurSaggile offers a fixed point (763 bc) in Assyrian chronology. Estimates for the approximate dates for the First Dynasty of Babylon and all earlier dynasties, and consequently for the dates of Samsi-Adad I and his son in Assyria, can be derived from a variety of historical and archaeological considerations. But for precise dates within the parameters thus arrived at we are (or may be) crucially dependent on the astronomical and
statistical interpretation of a group of tablets known collec tively as the ‘Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa’, which appear to record a sequence of first and last visibilities of Venus during the early years of the reign of Ammisaduqa, penultimate king of the First Dynasty of Babylon. If reliable astronomical data can be drawn from these tablets, then in principle they should allow us to establish a small number of precise possibilities for the chronology of his reign. The various possible dates are separated from each other by 56 or 64 years because of the nature of the cycles of Venus’s visibility. A combination of historical and archaeological evidence led to the conclusion that only three possible dates for Ammisaduqa were worth consideration, 1702-1682, 1646-1626 or 1582-1562, and for a long time it has been conventional to accept 1646-1626, the so-called ‘Middle Chronology’, as the best compromise with the varying strands of evidence. A reassessment of the astronomical data by Peter Huber of Harvard University (Astronomical Dating of Babylon I and Ur III, Malibu 1982) has demonstrated that the dates 1646-1626 are no longer plausible and that the earlier dates, 1702-1682, are to be preferred. However, historical and archaeological considera tions continue to suggest a cautious approach, and most writers currently prefer to retain the Middle Chronology, as presented here, as a convenient convention, although it no longer has an astronomical basis. In the transliteration of Sumerian and Akkadian names this table retains the five letters s, s, §, t and t used by Assyriolo gists, which elsewhere in this book have been represented as s, s, sh, t and t respectively.
Assyria
Each civil year in Assyria bore the name of an official ap pointed for that year, the limu. Copies of lists of these limu officials, known to Assyriologists as ‘eponym’ lists (using Greek terminology), have been found at Nineveh, Ashur and Sultantepe, and such copies were evidently the source from which the various Assyrian king-lists were compiled. In column 1 below is given the number of the king in the Assyrian king-lists: this reflects Brinkman’s numbering. In column 2 is given the king’s name; this is given in italics if the king’s reign is proven by contemporary royal inscriptions; the king’s ancestry is noted (s. = son; gs. = grandson; d. = descendant; b. = brother); where this ancestry is taken from the king-lists it is given in brackets, otherwise it is taken from contemporary inscriptions. It should be noted that where a king records his ancestry over more than one genera
tion, the term du MU is often to be interpreted as ‘descendant’ rather than ‘son’. In column 3 are given the king’s dates according to the current conventional chronology, as in Brinkman (1977). In column 4 is given the number of years assigned to the king by the king-lists (note the uncertainty in the cases of kings 61, 79 and 82). In column 5, from king 87 onwards, is noted whether the eponym (limu) officials of the king’s reign are attested in the eponym-lists; where complete these lists can be used to confirm the length of the king’s reign, and it is assumed that such lists were the source from which the king-lists them selves were compiled (note King-List 9’s comment on kings 27-32). The eponym-lists are fragmentary for the period c. 1100-911 bc, and can be completely reconstructed for the period 910-649 bc.
230



Mesopotamian Chronology
In column 6 is recorded (according to Grayson’s numbering in Reallexikon derAssyriologie ¥1(1980), pp. 86-135) whether the king is listed in one or more ofthe king-lists (including the principal Assyrian king-list, no. 9). In column 7 is recorded (according to Grayson’s number ing, loc. cit.) whether the king is listed in one or more of the chronicles. In column 8 is recorded miscellaneous information includ ing the name of the contemporary Babylonian king; this name is either given by the Synchronistic king-list (King-List 12), which is plainly totally unreliable before 1250 bc, or by the chronicles; if taken from the chronicles it is given in italics.
It is now understood that the first 29 names in the list are ancestors of the Assyrian kings, and that the real list of kings begins with Puzur-Assur I. The list of ancestors may be compared with, and is in part identical with, the list of ancestors contained in the ‘Genealogy of the Hammurapi Dynasty’ (J. J. Finkelstein, Journal of Cuneiform Studies 20 (1966), pp. 95-118). For king 40c see A. K. Grayson, Annual Review ofthe Royal Inscriptions ofMesopotamia 3, pp. 9-14, and for king 78a and his possible relationship to king 80 see E. F. Weidner, Die Inschriften Tukulti-Ninurta I, no. 42.

Babylonia
From the time of the dynasty of Akkad down to the end of the Old Babylonian dynasty each civil year bore a name based on the events of the previous year. Fragmentary copies of lists of these year-names have survived, and such lists were evidently the source from which the various Sumerian and Babylonian king-lists were compiled. In column i below is given the number of the king in Brinkman’s list. Note that the identity and order of the first Kassite kings remains uncertain; for a detailed discussion of the evidence see Brinkman (1976). In column 2 is given the king’s name; this is given in italics if the king’s reign is proven by contemporary royal inscriptions; the king’s ancestry is noted (s = son; gs. = grandson; d. = descendant; b. = brother); this ancestry is taken from con temporary inscriptions. In column 3 are given the king’s dates according to the current conventional chronology, as in Brinkman (1977). In column 4 is given the number of years assigned to the king by the king-lists. Note that King-List 7 is extremely
unreliable in the years it records for the Old Babylonian dynasty when tested against the lists of year-names. In column 5 is noted the number of regnal years attested for each king either by the lists ofyear-names (for the Ur 111, Isin, Larsa and Babylon I dynasties) or from the Kassite dynasty onwards by contemporary economic texts; in the latter case, where no contemporary economic texts are preserved the symbol □ is used, otherwise the date on the latest dated economic text is given, but in a few cases a number in brackets indicates that an inscription from a later period indicates a transaction in a particular year of the king in question (e.g. a transaction in year n of Adad-apla-iddina). In column 6 is recorded (according to Grayson’s numbering in Reallexikon der Assyriologie Vl (1980), pp. 86-135, except for King-Kist S, the Sumerian King-List) whether the king is listed in one or more of the king-lists. In column 7 is recorded (according to Grayson’s number ing, loc. cit.) whether the king is mentioned in one or more of the chronicles. In column 8 is recorded miscellaneous infor mation; for contemporary kings in Assyria see above.

History/Art History/Archaeology
The Ancient Near East has been
described as the “cradle of civilization’’
because it was here that so many things
we now take for granted had their origins,
in particular writing, wheel-made pottery
and perhaps glass. The British Museum
has one of the world’s greatest collections
of artifacts from this area, which ranges
from Turkey in lhe west to Iran and
Central Asia in the east, and from the
Caucasus in the north to the borders of
Egypt and the Gulf in the south. Among
them are painted pottery, figurines,
cylinder seals and stone amulets from the
earliest village cultures before 3000 bc;
magnificent finds from the rich graves of
the Royal Cemetery at Ur, including
jewelry, musical instruments and the
famous Royal Standard; the superb
carved reliefs from the Assyrian palaces
of the 1st millennium bc, and the glorious
Sasanian metalwork of the early centuries
ad, before the rise of Islam. Dominique
Collon presents the artistic achievements
of the peoples of the Ancient Near East
against their historical and cultural
background and, in a final chapter, shows
how echoes of them can still be found in
our own world today.
Dominique Collon is an Assistant Keeper
in the Department of Western Asiatic
Antiquities in the British Museum. She
has travelled extensively in lhe Near East
and taken part in excavations in Iraq,
Turkey and Syria. Her other publications
include First Impressions: Cylinder Seals in
the Ancient Near East (1987).
