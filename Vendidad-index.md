General Introduction
The Vidēvdād (or Vendidad) is an ancient collection of Zoroastrian
myths, prayers, and religious observances, intended to defend against sources of infection and evil. Particular attention is given to disposal
of the dead and other “dead matter” (nasu), to keep disease from spreading, as well as avoid polluting the earth, water, etc. Its present
form is thought to have become fixed around the middle of the first millennium BCE.1 Of the twenty-one books of the Sasanian canon of
the Avesta that were detailed in the Denkard, this is the only one which has survived in its entirety. James Darmesteter translated the
text in 1880, relying heavily on the Pahlavi translation. In 1898 he published a revised translation. Fritz Wolff later translated the major
texts of the Avesta into German, based on Bartholomae’s monumental Avestan dictionary. According to Kellens, “Darmesteter is sometimes
superior in his understanding of the Vidēvdād.” 2 His notes in particular remain invaluable.
In preparing this edition, I have replaced the spelling of Zoroastrian technical terms with more familiar forms, following
Kotwal and Boyd, 1982, as much as possible.
The Denkard Book 8, chapter 44 gives this synopsis of the
contents:3
1. The Vendidad contains particulars of Ohrmazd having produced
the pleasure of mankind by that place where they specially made a residence, and the advantage from the same production. 2. About the
formation of sixteen perfect places specially enumerated, and also the adversity which has happened to each separately.
3. About Ohrmazd’s disclosing the religion first among mankind to Yim (Jamshed); its non-acceptance by Yim owing to attachment
(asrunoih) to the religion of the ancients; and the acceptance of other things to develop, extend, and improve the world thereby. 4. About
the reason of the needfulness of making the enclosure (var) that Yim made, the command and instruction by Ohrmazd to Yim, the making
by Yim just as Ohrmazd commanded and instructed, and whatever is on the same subject.
5. About what the comfort of the spirit of the earth is most owing to, what its discomfort is more particularly owing to, and from what
its greatest gratification has arisen.

pure creatures are taken, as regards a corpse which has become polluted by another corpse.

that exists for him — towards those of the same religion who come forward with a request. 15. About the extent of sleeping in the day and
night, and other matters as to occupation which occurs daily.
16. About the grievous sinfulness of having taken a false oath, so
that, apart even from the testifying retribution of the property, the oath taken thereon has also an efficacy very much for the accusers,
which, on account of Mihr, Srosh, and Rashn, is an awful destroyer and adversary for one’s own person, wife, child, and property; also the
grievous bridge-judgment which is an appendage to one’s own soul.
17. About the sin of bringing firewood, with which dead matter is
mingled, to a fire; and this too, that is, how and when one is innocent therein. 18. About a ditch (joi), which is not always a stream (navo),

FARGARD 1. Sixteen perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda, and as many plagues created by Angra Mainyu.
Synopsis:4
This chapter is an enumeration of sixteen perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda, and of as many plagues created in opposition by Angra
Mainyu.
Many attempts have been made, not only to identify these sixteen
lands, but also to draw historical conclusions from their order of succession, as representing the actual order of the migrations and
settlements of the old Iranian tribes. But there is nothing in the text to support such wide inferences We have here nothing more than a
geographical description of Iran, seen from the religious point of view.
Of these sixteen lands there are nine which can be identified with
certainty, as follows:
Avestan Old Persian Greek Modern Name Sughdha (2) Suguda Σογδιανή Soghd (Samarkand)5 Mouru (3) Margu Μαργιανή Marv (Merv) Bakhdhi (4) Bākhtri Βάκτρα Balkh6 Haroyu (6) Haraiva ’Αρεία Harē(rud)7 Vehrkana (9) Varkāna ‛Υρκανία Gurgān, Jorgān Harahvaiti (10) Harauvati ’Αραχωσία Av-rokhaj, Arghand-(āb) Haetumant (11) ’Ετύμανδρος Helmend Ragha (12) Ragā8 ‛Ραγαί Raī Hapta hindu (15) Hindava ’Ινδοί Hind (Punjab)
as we are able to follow their names from the records of the
Achaemenian kings or the works of classical writers down to the map of modern Iran.
For the other lands we are confined for information to the Pahlavi Commentary, from which we get:
AVESTAN NAME. PAHLAVI NAME. MODERN NAME. Vaekereta (7) Kāpūl Kabul
4 For an analysis see Boyce, 1992, pp. 3 ff. and Christensen, 1943. 5 I.e. Sogdiana. -JHP 6 I.e. Bactria in northern Afghanistan. -JHP 7 I.e. Aria in western Afghanistan. -JHP
8 See however § 16, note. -JD. All the identifiable lands are in eastern or northeastern Iran, with the possible exception of Rai in the south, the identification of which is disputed. -JHP
1



2 Vendidad
Urva (8) Mēshan Mesene Varena (14) Patashkhvārgar or Dailam Tabaristān or Gīlān Rangha (16) Arvastāni Rūm Eastern Mesopotamia
The identification of Nisaya (5) and Chakhra (13) remains an open
question, as there were several cities of that name. We know, however, that Nisaya lay between Balkh and Marv. The first province
Airyanem Vaeja, or Eranwej, we identify with the medieval Arrān (nowadays known as Karabagh).
There must have been some systematical idea in the order followed, though it is not apparent, except in the succession of
Sughdha, Mouru, Bakhdhi, Nisaya, Haroyu, Vaekereta (numbers 2-7), which form one compact group of north-eastern provinces; the last
two provinces, Hindu and Rangha (numbers 15-16), are the two limitroph provinces, east and west (Indus and Tigris); and the Rangha
brings us back to the first province, Eranwej, whose chief river, the Vanguhi Daitya, or Aras, springs from the same mountains as the
Rangha-Tigris.
The several plagues created by Angra Mainyu to mar the native
perfection of Ahura’s creations give instructive information on the religious condition of several of the Iranian countries at the time
when this Fargard was written. Harat seems to have been the seat of puritan sects that pushed rigorism to the extreme in the law of
purification. Sorcery was prevalent in the basin of the Helmend river, and the Paris were powerful in Cabul, which is a Zoroastrian way of
saying that the Hindu civilisation prevailed in those parts, which in fact in the two centuries before and after Christ were known as White
India, and remained more Indian than Iranian till the Moslem conquest.
Translation
1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama9 Zarathushtra, saying:
I have made every land dear (to its people), even though it had no charms whatever in it:10 had I not made every land dear (to its
people), even though it had no charms whatever in it, then the whole living world would have invaded the Airyana Vaeja.11
9 Or Spitamide. Zarathushtra was descended from Spitama at the fifth generation.
10 ‘Everyone fancies that the land where he was born and has been brought up is the best and fairest land that I have created’ (Comm.)
11 Gr. Bd: ‘It is said in the Sacred Book: had I not created the Genius of the native place, all mankind would have gone to Eran-Vej, on account of its pleasantness.’ — On Airyanem Vaeja or Eran-Vej, see following note.



Vendidad 3
2.12 The first of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the Airyana Vaeja,13 by the Vanguhi Daitya.14
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created the serpent in the river15 and Winter, a work of the Daevas.16
3. There are ten winter months there, two summer months;17 and
[even] those are cold for the waters,18 cold for the earth, cold for the trees.19 Winter falls there, the worst of all plagues.
12 Clause 2 in the Vendidad Sada is composed of Zend quotations in the Commentary that illustrate the alternative process of creation: ‘First, Ahura Mazda would create a land of such kind that its dwellers might like it, and there could be nothing more delightful. Then he who is all death would bring against it a counter-creation.’
13 Airyanem Vaeja, Iran-Vej, is the holy land of Zoroastrianism: Zarathushtra was born and founded his religion there (Bd20.32; 32.3): the first animal couple appeared there (Bd14.4; Zadspram, 9.8). From its name, ‘the Iranian seed,’ it seems to have been considered as the original seat of the Iranian race. It has been generally supposed to belong to Eastern Iran, like the provinces which are enumerated after it, chiefly on account of the name of its river, the Vanguhi Daitya, which was in the Sassanian times (as Veh) the name of the Oxus. But the Bd. distinctly states that Iran-Vej is ‘bordering upon Adarbajan’ (29.12); now, Adarbaijan is bordered by the Caspian Sea on the east, by the Rangha provinces on the west, by Media proper on the south, and by Arran on the north. The Rangha provinces are out of question, since they are mentioned at the end of the Fargard (verse 20), and the climatic conditions of Iran-Vej with its long winter likewise exclude Media and suit Arran, where the summer lasts hardly two months (cf. § 4, note 6). The very name agrees, as the country known as Arran seems to have been known to the Greeks as ’Αριανία (Stephanus Byz.), which brings it close to our Airyanem. On the Vanguhi Daitya, see following note.
14 The Vanguhi Daitya, belonging to Arran, must be the modern Aras (the classic Araxes). The Aras was named Vanguhi, like the Oxus, but distinguished from it by the addition Daitya, which made it ‘the Vanguhi of the Law’ (the Vanguhi by which Zarathushtra received the Law).
15 ‘There are many Khrafstras in the Daitik, as it is said, The Daitik full of Khrafstras’ (Bd20.13). Snakes abound on the banks of the Araxes (Morier, A Second Journey, p. 250) nowadays as much as in the time of Pompeius, to whom they barred the way from Albania to Hyrcania (Plut.)
16 Arran (Karabagh) is celebrated for its cold winter as well as for its beauty. At the Naoroz (first day of spring) the fields still lie under the snow. The temperature does not become milder before the second fortnight of April; no flower is seen before May. Summer, which is marked by the migration of the nomads from the plain to the mountains, begins about the 20th of June and ends in the middle of August.
17 Vendidad Sada: ‘It is known that [in the ordinary course of nature] there are seven months of summer and five of winter’ (see Bd25).
18 Some say: ‘Even those two months of summer are cold for the waters...’ (Comm.; see Mainyo-i-khard 44.20).
19 Vend. Sada: ‘There reigns the core and heart of winter.’

4. The second of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the plain20 which the Sughdhas inhabit.21
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created the locust,22 which brings death unto cattle and plants.
5. The third of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was the strong, holy Mouru.23
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created plunder and sin.24
6. The fourth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the beautiful Bakhdhi25 with high-lifted banner.
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created the ants and the ant-hills.26
7. The fifth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was Nisaya,27 that lies between the Mouru and Bakhdhi.
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created the sin of unbelief.28
8. The sixth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was the house-deserting Haroyu.29
20 Doubtful. 21 Old P. Suguda; Sogdiana.
22 The plague that fell to that country was the bad locust: it devours the plants and death comes to the cattle’ (Gr. Bd.) 23 Margu; Μαργιανή; Marv.
24 Doubtful. The Gr. Bd. has: ‘The plague that fell to that country was the coming and going of troops: for there is always there an evil concourse of horsemen, thieves, robbers, and heretics, who speak untruth and oppress the righteous.’ Marv continued to be the resort of Turanian plunderers till the recent Russian annexation. 25 Bakhtri; Βάκτρα; Balkh. 26 ‘The corn-carrying ants’ (Asp.; cf. Farg. 14.5).
27 By contradistinction to other places of the same name. There was a Nisaya, in Media, where Darius put to death the Mage Gaumata (Behishtun I, 58). There was also a Nisā in Fars, another in Kirman, a third again on the way from Amol to Marv (Tabari, tr. Noeldeke, p.101, 2), which may be the same as Νισαία, the capital of Parthia (Παρθαύνισα ap. Isid. of Charax 12); cf. Pliny VI, 25 (29). One may therefore he tempted to translate, ‘Nisaya between which and Bakhdhi Mouru lies;’ but the text hardly admits of that construction, and we must suppose the existence of another Nisaya on the way from Balkh to Marv. 28 There are people there ‘who doubt the existence of God (Comm.)
29 Harōyu, Old P. Haraiva (transcribed in Greek and Latin ’Αρεία Aria instead of ‛Αρεία Haria, by a confusion with the name of the Aryans); P. Harē (in Firdausi and in Harē-rūd; Harāt is an Arabicised form. — ‘The house-deserting Harē:

Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created tears and wailing.30
9. The seventh of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was Vaekereta,31 of the evil shadows.
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created the Pairika Knathaiti,32 who claves unto Keresaspa.
10. The eighth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was Urva of the rich pastures.33
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created the sin of pride.34
11. The ninth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was Khnenta which the Vehrkanas35 inhabit.
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter
created a sin for which there is no atonement, the unnatural sin.36
12. The tenth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the beautiful Harahvaiti.37
because there, when a man dies in a house, the people of the house leave it and go. We keep the ordinances for nine days or a month: they leave the house and absent themselves from it for nine days or a month’ (Gr. Bd.) See Vd5.42.
30 ‘The tears and wailing for the dead,’ the voceros. The tears shed over a dead man grow to a river that prevents his crossing the Chinwad bridge (Saddar 96; Arda Viraf 16.7, 10).
31 Vaēkereta, an older name of Kabul (Kāpūl: Comm. and Gr. Bd.); perhaps the Ptolemeian Βαγάρδα in Paropanisus (Ptol. VI, 18).
32 The Pairika, in Zoroastrian mythology, symbolises idolatry (uzdes-parastih). The land of Kubul, till the Moslem invasion, belonged to the Indian civilisation and was mostly of Brahmanical and Buddhist religion. The Pairika Khnathaiti will be destroyed at the end of the world by Saoshyant, the unborn son of Zarathushtra (when all false religions vanish before the true one; Vd19.5). — Sama Keresaspa, the Garshasp of later tradition, is the type of impious heroism: he let himself be seduced to the Daeva-worship, and Zarathushtra saw him punished in hell for his contempt of Zoroastrian observances.

FARGARD 2. Myths of Yima [Jamshed]
Introduction to Fargard 2.
Compare this translation with those given in Malandra 1983, pp. 178 ff., and Boyce 1990, pp. 94 ff.
For a comparison of the underground enclosure of Yima with the the Indic/Sanskrit Yama as ruler of the underground, see Lincoln
1991, p. 28. Also see Boyce History I 1996, pp. 92 ff. Synopsis:
This Fargard may be divided into two parts.
First part (1-20). Ahura Mazda proposes to Yima, the son of
Vivanghat, to receive the law from him and to bring it to men. On his refusal, he bids him keep his creatures and make them prosper. Yima
accordingly makes them thrive and increase, keeps death and disease away from them, and three times enlarges the earth, which had
become too narrow for its inhabitants.
Second part (21 to the end). On the approach of a dire winter,
which is to destroy every living creature, Yima, being advised by Ahura, builds a Vara to keep there the finest representatives of every
kind of animals and plants, and they live there a life of perfect happiness.
It is difficult not to acknowledge in the latter legend a Zoroastrian adaptation of the deluge, whether it was borrowed from the Bible or
from the Chaldaean mythology. The similitude is so striking that it did not escape the Moslems, and Macoudi states that certain authors
place the date of the deluge in the time of Jamshed. There are essential and necessary differences between the two legends, the chief
one being that in the monotheistic narration the deluge is sent as a punishment from God, whereas in the dualistic version it is a plague
from the Daevas: but the core of the two legends is the same: the hero in both is a righteous man who, forewarned by God, builds a refuge to
receive choice specimens of mankind) intended some day to replace an imperfect humanity, destroyed by a universal calamity.

1. Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!

Who was the first mortal, before myself, Zarathushtra, with whom
thou, Ahura Mazda, didst converse,57 whom thou didst teach the Religion of Ahura, the Religion of Zarathushtra?
2. Ahura Mazda answered: The fair Yima, the good shepherd,58 O holy Zarathushtra! he was the first mortal, before thee, Zarathushtra,
with whom I, Ahura Mazda, did converse, whom I taught the Religion of Ahura, the Religion of Zarathushtra. 3. Unto him, O Zarathushtra,
I, Ahura Mazda, spake, saying: ‘Well, fair Yima, son of Vivanghat, be thou the preacher and the bearer of my Religion!’ And the fair Yima,
O Zarathushtra, replied unto me, saying: ‘I was not born, I was not taught to be the preacher and the bearer of thy Religion.’
4. Then I, Ahura Mazda, said thus unto him, O Zarathushtra: ‘Since thou dost not consent to be the preacher and the bearer
[propagator]59 of my Religion, then make thou my world increase, make my world grow: consent thou to nourish, to rule, and to watch
over my world.’
5. And the fair Yima replied unto me, O Zarathushtra, saying: ‘Yes!
I will make thy world increase, I will make thy world grow. Yes! I will nourish, and rule, and watch over thy world. There shall be, while I
am king, neither cold wind not hot wind, neither disease nor death.’
6.60 Then I, Ahura Mazda, brought two implements unto him: a
golden seal and a poniard inlaid with gold.61 7. Behold, here Yima bears the royal sway!62
8. Thus, under the sway of Yima, three hundred winters passed away, and the earth was replenished with flocks and herds, with men
and dogs and birds and with red blazing fires, and there was room no more for flocks, herds, and men.

seal, and thou shalt make a door, and a window self-shining within.’
31. Then Yima said within himself: ‘How shall I manage to make
that Vara which Ahura Mazda has commanded me to make?’ And Ahura Mazda said unto Yima: ‘O fair Yima, son of Vivanghat! Crush
the earth with a stamp of thy heel, and then knead it with thy hands, as the potter does when kneading the potter’s clay.’85
32. [And Yima did as Ahura Mazda wished; he crushed the earth with a stamp of his heel, he kneaded it with his hands, as the potter
does when kneading the potter’s clay.86]
33. And Yima made a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side
of the square. There he brought the seeds of sheep and oxen, of men, of dogs, of birds, and of red blazing fires. He made a Vara, long as a
riding-ground on every side of the square, to be an abode for men; a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of the square, for oxen and

92 ‘The bird Karshipta dwells in the heavens: were he living on the earth, he would be the king of birds. He brought the Religion into the Var of Vima, and recites the Avesta in the language of birds’ (Bd19 and Bd24). The Comm. identifies the Karshiptan with the Chakhravak, that is the Chakravaka of poetical reputation in India.
93 Zarathushtra had three sons during his lifetime, Isat-vastra, Hvare-chithra, and Urvatat-nara, who were respectively the fathers and chiefs of the three classes, priests, warriors, and husbandmen. Urvatat-nara, as a husbandman, was chosen to be the ahu or temporal Lord of the Var, on account of the Var being underground. Zarathushtra, as a heavenly priest, was, by right, the ratu or Spiritual Lord in Airyana Vaejah, where he founded the Religion by a sacrifice (Bd33 and Introd. III, 15).

FARGARD 3. the Earth
Introduction to Fargard 3.
“Les Guèbres,” says Chardin (ed. Langlēs, VIII, 358), “regardent l’agriculture, non seulement comme une profession belle et innocente,
mais aussi comme méritoire et noble, et ils croient que c’est la première de toutes les vocations, celle pour quoi le Dieu souverain et
les dieux inférieurs, comme ils parlent, ont le plus de complaisance et qu’ils recompensent le plus largement. Cette opinion, tournée en
créance parmi eux, fait qu’ils se portent naturellement à travailler à la terre et qu’ils s’y exercent le plus: leurs prētres leur enseignent que la
plus vertueuse activité est d’engendrer des enfants (cf. Farg. IV, 47) et aprés de cultiver une terre qui serait en friche (cf. infra, § 4), de
planter un arbre soit fruitier, soit autre.”
The classical writers (Xenophon, Oeconomica, IV, 4 seq.; Polybius,
X, 28, quoted § 4, note) express themselves to the same effect, and their testimony has been lately corroborated, in a most unexpected
way, by a Greek inscription (discovered at Deremendjik, near Magnesia, on the Maeander: by Cousin and Deschamps, Bullein de
Correspondance hellénique, XIII: 529), emanating from no less an authority than King Darius himself, who congratulates his satrap in
Asia Minor, Gadates, “for working well the King’s earth and transplanting in lower Asia the fruits of the country beyond
Euphrates. The third Fargard may serve as a Commentary to those texts. Synopsis.
The principal subject is, as the Denkard has it: What comforts most the Genius of the Earth (§§ 1-6)? What discomforts most the Genius of the Earth (§§ 7-11)? What rejoices the Earth most (§§ 12-35)?
In each of these three developments a series of five objects is
considered. Series I and II, though expressed in symmetrical terms, do not answer one another: there is greater symmetry, as to the ideas,
between the second series and the third. Series I and II are a dry enumeration. The third series contains two interesting digressions,
one on the funeral laws (§§ 14-21), and the other on the sanctity of husbandry (§§ 24-33).
The Fargard ends with a development forbidding the burial of the dead (§§ 36-42); it is a sort of commentary to § 8.

The subject of this chapter has become a commonplace topic with
the Parsis, who have treated it more or less antithetically in the Mainyai-khard (chaps. 5 and 6) and in the Riv. [ch. 98] (Gr. Riv. pp.
434-437).

mountains all through the Iranian desert, Persia would starve.
104 The neck of Arezura (Arezurahe griva) is “a mount at the gate of hell, whence the demons rush forth” (Bd12.8; Dadistan 33.5); it is also called “the head of Arezura” (Vd19.45), or ‘the back of Arezura’ (Bd12.2). Arezura was a fiend, son of Ahriman, who was killed by the first man, Gayomard (Menog-i Khrad 27.15). The mount named from him hes in the North (which is the seat of the demons): it seems to belong to the Alborz chain, like the Damavand (Bd12.8), where Azi Dahaka [Zohak] was bound (Vd1.18, notes). 105 Hell, the Druj being assimilated to a burrowing Khrafstra. See Vd7.24.
106 ‘It is declared in the good religion, that, when they conceal a corpse beneath the ground, Spendarmad, the archangel, shudders; it is just as severe as a serpent or scorpion would be to any one in a sleeping-garment, and it is also just like that to the ground. When thou makest a corpse beneath the ground as it were apparent, thou makest the ground liberated ftom that affliction’ (Saddar 33, tr. by West, in the Sacred Books of the East, XXIV). See Vd6.51; Vd7.45.
107 With regard to Dakhmas, see Vd6.45. ‘Nor is the Earth happy at that place whereon stands a Dakhma with corpses upon it; for that patch of ground will never be clean again till the day of resurrection’ (Gr. Riv. 435, 437). Although the erection of Dakhmas is enjoined by the law, yet the Dakhma in itself is as unclean as any spot on the earth can be, since it is always in contact with the dead see (Vd7.55). The impurity which would otherwise be scattered over the whole world, is thus brought together to one and the same spot. Yet even that spot, in spite of the Riv., is not to lie defiled for ever, as every fifty years the Dakhmas ought to be pulled down, so that their sites may be restored to their natural purity (see Vd7.49 ff. and this Farg. verse 13).

14. Let no man alone by himself112 carry a corpse.113 If a man alone
by himself carry a corpse, the Nasu114 rushes upon him, to defile him, from the nose of the dead, from the eye, from the tongue, from the
jaws, from the sexual organs, from the hinder parts. This Druj Nasu falls upon him, [stains him] even to the end of the nails, and he is
unclean, thenceforth, for ever and ever.
108 ‘Where there are most Khrafstras’ (noxious animals). 109 Killed by an enemy.
110 This joy answers the second grief of the earth (§ 8; cf. note). There is no counterpart given to the first grief (§ 7), because, as the Commentary naively expresses it, “it is not possible now so to dig out hell,” which will be done at the end of the world (Bd30.32). 111 This answers the third grief (§ 9; cf. note).
112 No ceremony in general can be performed by one man alone. Two Mobeds are wanted to perform the Vendidad service, two priests for the Barashnum, two persons for the Sag-did (Anquetil, II, 584 n.) It is never good that the faithful should be alone, as the fiend is always lurking about, ready to take advantage of any moment of inattention. If the faithful be alone, there is no one to make up for any negligence and to prevent mischief arising from it. Never is the danger greater than in the present case, when the fiend is close at hand, and in direct contact with the faithful.
113 A corpse from which the Nasu has not been expelled by the Sag-did ceremony (described Vd8.14-22).
114 The word Nasu has two meanings: it means either the corpse (nasai), or the corpse-demon (the Druj Nasu, that is to say the demon who takes possession of the dead body and makes his presence felt by the decomposition of the body and infection).

Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated bundles of Baresma, and by the faithful.’116

shall wear, and thus shall they let him live, until he has grown to the age of a Hana, or of a Zaurura, or of a Pairishta-khshudra.119
20,21. ‘And when he has grown to the age of a Hana, or of a Zaurura,120 or of a Pairishta-khshudra, then the worshippers of Mazda
shall order a man strong, vigorous, and skilful,121 to cut the head off his neck,122 in his enclosure on the top of the mountain: and they shall
deliver his corpse unto the greediest of the corpse-eating creatures made by the beneficent Spirit, unto the vultures, with these words:
“The man here has repented of all his evil thoughts, words, and deeds.
115 He cannot purify himself like the Nasa-salar (Vd8.13). ‘He who carries a man, knowing that the man is dead and that the Sag-did has not been performed, commits a sin worthy of death (margarzan).’ As the absence of Sag-did makes the infection worse, it is the same crime as if a man were to introduce a plague into the country. 116 To avoid any contact of that man with pure beings. 117 A pace (gāma) is as much as three feet (pādha; Vd9.8). 118 The Armesht-gāh, the place for the unclean; see Introd.

FARGARD 4. Contracts and offenses.
Synopsis.
This Fargard is the only one in the Vendidad that deals strictly with legal objects.
I a. Classification of the contracts according to the value of their object (§ 2). — A contract is cancelled by paying the amount of the
contract higher by one degree (§ 3-4).
Religious responsibility of the family for the breach of a contract
by one of its members (§§ 5-10).
Punishment of the Mihr-Druj (one who breaks a contract), (§§ 11
16).
II a. Definition of the outrages known as agerepta (threatening
attitude), avaoirishta (assault), aredush (blows), (§ 17).
Penalties for menaces — (§§ 18-21); for assaults (§§ 22-25); for
blows (§ 26-29); for wounds (§§ 30-33); for wounds causing blood to flow (§§ 34-36); for broken bones (§§ 37-39); for manslaughter (§§
40-43). III a. Contract of charity to co-religionists (§§ 44-45). IV a. Heinousness of false oath (§ 46). III b. Dignity of wealth; of marriage; of physical weal(§§ 47-49a). IV b. Heinousness of false oath. Ordeal (§§ 49b-55).
Part of this Fargard has been made unduly obscure by the
transposition of § 46) wrongly inserted between the clause on charity (§§ 44-45) and the corresponding development on the dignity of
material goods. This transposition is found in all known manuscripts and belonged to the older text from which they are derived. Translation

to the amount of a sheep;157 the fourth is the contract to the amount of an ox;158 the fifth is the contract to the amount of a man [person];159
the sixth is the contract to the amount of a field,160 a field in good land, a fruitful one, in good bearing.’161

will restore it to thee at the proper time, and he says to himself; I will not restore it’ (Comm.)
154 At first view it seems as if the classification were twofold, the contracts being defined in the first two clauses by their mode of being entered into, and in the last four by their amount. Yet it appears from the following clauses that even the word-contract and the hand-contract are indicative of a certain amount, which, however, the commentators did not, or were unable to, determine.
155 The word-contract may be a contract of which the object are words: the contract of jādangōi (ukhdhō-vachah), by which one offers to speak and intervene for some one’s benefit, or the contract between master and pupil (for teaching the sacred texts). 156 The contract for hiring labour (?).
157 ‘Viz. to the amount of 3 istīrs [in weight],’ (Comm.) An istīr (στατήρ) is as much as 4 dirhems (δραχμή). 158 ‘To the amount of 12 istīrs (=48 dirhems),’ (Comm.)
159 ‘To the amount of 500 dirhems.’ The exact translation would be rather, ‘The contract to the amount of a human being’ (promise of marriage). 160 ‘Upwards of 500 istīrs.’
161 A sort of gloss added to define more accurately the value of the object, and to indicate that it is greater than that of the preceding one.
162 Literally, how much is involved? The joint responsibility of the family was a principle in the Persian law: ‘Leges apud eos impendio formidatae, et abominandae aliae, per quas ob noxam unius omnis propinquitas perit’ (Am.

164 See § 11. This passage seems to have puzzled tradition. The Commentary says, ‘How long, how many years, has one to fear for the breach of a word-contract? the Nabanazdishtas have to fear for three hundred years;’ but it does not explain farther the nature of that fear; it only tries to reduce the circle of that liability to narrower limits: ‘only the son born after the breach is liable for it; the righteous are not liable for it; when the father dies, the son, if righteous, has nothing to fear from it.’ And finally, the Rivayats leave the kinsmen wholly aside; the penalty falling entirely upon the real offender, and the number denoting only the duration of his punishment in hell: ‘He who breaks a word-contract, his soul shall abide for three hundred years in hell’ (Gr. Riv. 94). 165 See § 12. ‘His soul shall abide for six hundred years in hell’ (Gr. Riv. 1.1.) 166 See § 13. ‘His soul shall abide for seven hundred years in hell’ (Gr.

176 In this paragraph are defined the first three of the eight outrages with which the rest of the Fargard deals. Only these three are defined, because they are designated by technical terms. We subjoin the definitions of them found in a Sanskrit translation of a Patet (Paris, Bibl. Nat. f. B. 5, 154), in which their etymological meanings are better preserved than in the Zend definition itself:-Agerepta, ‘seizing,’ is when a man seizes a weapon with a view to smite another. Avaoirishta, ‘brandishing,’ is when a man brandishes, a weapon with a view to smite another. Aredush is when a man actually smites another with a weapon, but without wounding him, or inflicts a wound which is healed within three days.

FARGARD 5. Purity Laws.
Synopsis.
This chapter and the following ones, to the end of the twelfth, deal chiefly with uncleanness arising from the dead, and with the means of
removing it from men and things. The subjects treated in this Fargard are as follows:-
I (1-7). If a man defile the fire or the earth with dead matter (Nasu), involuntarily or unconsciously, it is no sin. II (8-9). Water and fire do not kill.
III (10-14). Disposal of the dead during winter when it is not
possible to take them to the Dakhma.
IV (15-20). Why Ahura, while forbidding man to defile water,
sends water ftom the heavens down to the Dakhmas, covered with corpses. How he purifies that water.
V (21-26). On the excellence of purity and of the law that shows how to recover purity, when lost.
VI (27-38). On the defiling power of the Nasu being greater or less, according to the greater or less dignity of the being that dies.
VII (39-44). On the management of sacrificial implements [alat] defiled with Nasu.
VIII (45-62). On the treatment of a woman who has been delivered of a still-born child; and what is to be done with her clothes. Translation
I.
1. There dies a man in the depths of the vale: a bird takes flight from the top of the mountain down into the depths of the vale, and it
feeds on the corpse of the dead man there: then, up it flies from the depths of the vale to the top of the mountain: it flies to some one of
the trees there, of the hard-wooded or the soft-wooded, and upon that tree it vomits and deposits dung.
2. Now, lo! here is a man coming up from the depths of the vale to the top of the mountain; he comes to the tree whereon the bird is
sitting; from that tree he intends to take wood for the fire. He fells the tree, he hews the tree, he splits it into logs, and then he lights it in the
fire, the son of Ahura Mazda. What is the penalty he shall pay?207

Nasu that has been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies.
4. ‘For were there sin upon a man for any Nasu that might have been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies, how
soon all this material world of mine would be only one Peshotanu,208 bent on the destruction of righteousness, and whose soul will cry and
wail!209 so numberless are the beings that die upon the face of the earth.’
5. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Here is a man watering a corn-field. The water streams down the field; it streams

209 After their death, ‘When the soul, crying and beaten off, is driven far away from Paradise’ (Comm.) This is imitated from the Gathas (Yasna 46.11c; 51.13b; cf. Vd13.8-9).
210 For defiling the earth and the water: ‘If a man wants to irrigate a field, he must first look after the water-channel, whether there is dead matter in it or not ..... If the water, unknown to him, comes upon a corpse, there is no sin upon him. If he has not looked after the rivulet and the stream, he is unclean’ (Saddar 75).
211 Water and fire belong to the holy part of the world, and come from God; how then is it that they kill? ‘Let a Gueber light a sacred fire for a hundred years, if he once fall into it, he shall be burnt.’ Even the Mobeds, if we may trust Elisaeus, complained that the fire would burn them without regard for their piety, when to adore it they came too near (Vartan’s War, p. 211 of the French translation by l’Abbé Garabed). The answer was that it is not the fire nor the water that kills, but the demon of Death and Fate. ‘Nothing whatever that I created in the world, said Ohrmazd, does harm to man; it is the bad Nāi (read Vāi) that kills the man’ (Gr. Riv. 124).
212 ‘Asti-vahat is the bad Vai who seizes the life (of man): when his hand strokes him, it is lethargy; when he casts his shadow upon him, it is fever; when he looks in his eyes, he destroys life and it is called Death’ (Bd28.35). Cf. Vd4.49; Vd19.29. 213 ‘The bad Vai’ (Comm.) Vai (Vayu) is the Genius of Destiny, good or evil. 214 To the surface. 215 To the bottom.

10. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the summer

11. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How large shall
be those rooms for the dead? Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Large enough not to strike the skull of the man, if he219 should stand erect, or his feet
or his hands stretched out: such shall be, according to the law, the rooms for the dead.
12. ‘And they shall let the lifeless body lie there, for two nights, or for three nights, or a month long, until the birds begin to fly,220 the
plants to grow, the hidden floods221 to flow, and the wind to dry up the earth.222

The Zad-marj is a small mud house where the corpse is laid, to lie there till it can be taken to the Dakhma (Anquetil, ZendAvesta II, 583). The Zad-marj is still used in Persia, and in the Gujarati provinces (where it is called Nasa-khana, ‘house for corpses’). In Bombay they use the simpler and more economical method given in Vd8.8. 219 ‘Being in life’ (Comm.) 220 To come back. 221 They were hidden under the earth. 222 ‘Until the winter is past’ (Comm.)

The Ratu is the chief priest, the spiritual head of the community.

death, no touch of any Nasu.294 If it has not been prepared for the sacrifice, [the stem] is defiled the length of four fingers:295 it296 shall be

FARGARD 7. Purity Laws, Avestan medicine.
Synopsis.
I (1-5). How long after death the Druj Nasu takes possession of the corpse.
II (6-9 = V, 27-30). How far the defiling power of the Druj Nasu extends. III (10-22). Cleansing of clothes defiled by the dead. IV (23-24). Eating of Nasu an abomination. V (25-27), Bringing Nasu to fire or water an abomination. VI (28-35). Cleansing of wood and corn defiled by the dead. VII a (36-40). Physicians; their probation. VII b (41-44). Their fees.
VIII (45-59), Purification of the earth, of the Dakhmas. The Dakhmas and the Daevas,
IX (60-72; 66-69 = V, 45-54). Treatment of a woman who has brought forth a still-born child. X (73-75). Cleansing of vessels defiled by the dead. XI (76). Cleansing of the cow. XII (78). Unclean libations.
This chapter would offer tolerable unity, but for a digression on
medicine, which would be better placed as an introduction to the last three chapters. Sections II and IX, parts of which have already been
found in Fargard V, are more suitably placed here. This chapter, as a whole, deals with the action of the Druj Nasu, from the moment she
takes hold of the corpse, and shows how and when the several objects she has defiled become clean, namely, clothes, wood, corn, earth,
women, vessels, and cows.

beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When a man dies, at what moment does the Druj Nasu rush upon him?’

rushes upon him, from the regions of the north,304 in the shape of a

up, or until the flesh-eating birds have taken flight towards it.307 When the dog has seen it or eaten it up, or when the flesh-eating birds have
taken flight towards it, then the Druj Nasu rushes away to the regions of the north in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking
out, droning without end, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.’]
4. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the man has
been killed by a dog, or by a wolf, or by witchcraft, or by the artifices of hatred,308 or by falling down a precipice, or by the law,309 or by
calumny,310 or by the noose,311 how long after death does the Druj Nasu come and rush upon the dead?
5. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘At the next watch after death,312 the Druj Nasu comes and rushes upon the dead, from the regions of the
north, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, droning without end, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.’

6. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be a
number of men resting in the same place, on the same carpet, on the same pillows, be there two men near one another, or five, or fifty, or a
hundred, close by one another; and of those people one happens to die; how many of them does the Druj Nasu envelope with corruption,
infection, and pollution?
305 Khrafstra is a general denomination for noxious animals. 306 Until the Sag-did has been performed (see Vd8.16 seq.)
307 The Sag-did may be performed by birds of prey as well as by dogs. The dog smites the Nasu when it brings its muzzle near to the dead, the bird (mountain hawk, sparrow (?), or eagle) when its shadow passes over the body (Comm. ad § 2; cf. § 29). § 3 is from the Vendidad Sada. 308 ‘By poison’ (Comm.)
309 Literally, ‘by men;’ that is to say, put to death by the community according to law (Comm.) 310 If he has been condemned unjustly. 311 If he has strangled himself.
312 The day is divided into five watches or ratu. If the man dies a natural death, the Druj comes directly; if the death be violent and unlooked for, the Druj comes later (as the corruption does not set in so quickly). 313 §§ 6-9 = Vd5.27-30.

garment.’317

garment be made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! that has been touched by the carcass of a dog or the corpse of a man? 13. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It can, O holy Zarathushtra!’ How so?

60.369 O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If in the house of a worshipper of Mazda there be a woman with child, and if
being a month gone, or two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten months gone, she bring forth a still-born
child, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?
61. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘The place in that Mazdean house
whereof the ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed through by flocks and herds, by the fire of Ahura Mazda, by the
consecrated bundles of baresma, and by the faithful;’
62. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from
the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated bundles of baresma? How far from the faithful?
63. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Thirty paces from the fire; thirty paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles of
Baresma; three paces from the faithful;

enclosure, and therein shall they establish her with food, therein shall they establish her with clothes.’

67. ‘Afterwards she may drink boiling milk of mares, cows, sheep, or goats, with pap or without pap; she may take cooked milk without
water, meal without water, and wine without water.’ 68. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall she remain so?
How long shall she live thus on milk, meal, and wine?
69. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Three nights long shall she remain
so; three nights long shall she live thus on milk, meal, and wine. Then, when three nights have passed, she shall wash her body, she shall
wash her clothes, with gomez and water, by the nine holes, and thus shall she be clean.’
70. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! But if fever befall her unclean body, if these two worst pains, hunger and thirst,
befall her, may she be allowed to drink water?370
71. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘She may; the first thing for her is to
have her life saved. From the hands of one of the holy men, a holy faithful man, who knows the holy knowledge,371 she shall drink of the
strength-giving water. But you, worshippers of Mazda, fix ye the penalty for it. The Ratu being applied to, the Sraosha-varez being
applied to,372 shall prescribe the penalty to be paid.’373 72. What is the penalty to be paid?
Ahura Mazda answered: ‘The deed is that of a Peshotanu: two hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra, two hundred stripes with the

unfit for libation; or who offers up in the dead of the night water unfit for libation.’381

1. If a dog or a man die under a hut of wood or a hut of felt382 what
shall the worshippers of Mazda do?383
2. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘They shall search for a Dakhma, they
shall look for a Dakhma all around.384 If they find it easier to remove the dead, they shall take out the dead, they shall let the house stand,
and shall perfume it with Urvasna or Vohu-gaona, or Vohu-kereti, or Hadha-naepata, or any other sweet-smelling plant.385
382 A movable shelter, by contradistinction to a fixed abode, something like the oba of the Tartars, one of those huts made of boards or felt and called thāruma by the Arabs, which served as pavilions for princes as well as tents for nomads.
383 That sort of abode, having only one room, can have no chamber for the dead (Vd5.10).
384 If there is a Dakhma In the proximity, they remove the corpse at once. If there is no Dakhma or the season prevents its access, they purify the hut first.
385 ’so, when a dog or a man dies, the first thing to do is to take the corpse out (from the house), and to purify the house, inside and outside, with perfumes burnt on the fire’ (Comm.) See Vd11.4. Urvāsna is the rāsan plant, a sort of garlic; Vohūgaona, Vohū-kereti, and Haδā-naēpata are respectively (according to Framji) benzoin, aloe, and pomegranate.

4. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If in the house of a worshipper of Mazda a dog or a man happens to die, and it is
raining,386 or snowing, or blowing6, or it is dark, or the day is at its end, when flocks and men lose their way, what shall the worshippers
of Mazda do?387
5. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘The place in that house whereof the
ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed through by flocks and herds, by the fire of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated
bundles of Baresma, and by the faithful;’
6. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from
the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated bundles of Baresma? How far from the faithful?
7. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Thirty paces from the fire; thirty paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles of
Baresma; three paces from the faithful;
8. ‘On that place they shall dig a grave,388 half a foot deep if the
earth be hard, half the height of a man if it be soft;389 [they shall cover the surface of the grave with ashes or cowdung];390 they shall cover the
surface of it with dust of bricks, of stones, or of dry earth.391
9.392 ‘And they shall let the lifeless body lie there, for two nights, or
three nights, or a month long, until the birds begin to fly, the plants to grow, the hidden floods to flow, and the wind to dry up the earth.
386 ‘No corpse must be taken to the Daknma when rain is falling, or threatening. If one is overtaken by rain on the way, if there be a place to lay it down, they shall lay it down; if there be none, they must go on and take it to the Dakhma, they must not retrace their steps.... When arrived at the Dakhma, if they find it full of water, they may nevertheless lay down the corpse’ (Comm.) 387 If it is the season of rain or snow. See Vd5.10 seq.
388 This is the case when the house is too small for containing a special chamber for the dead (as prescribed Vd5.10). Nowadays they dispense even with that grave: the corpse is laid on the floor, on a slab of marble, by which it is sufficiently isolated from the ground to prevent its being defiled. 389 Soft earth, being not impervious to liquids, lets contagion through more easily. 390 Vendidad Sada.

and they shall lay it down on a place where they know there are always corpse-eating dogs and corpse-eating birds.
11. ‘Afterwards the corpse-bearers shall sit down, three paces from the dead, and the holy Ratu397 shall proclaim to the worshippers of
Mazda thus: “Worshippers of Mazda, let the urine be brought here wherewith the corpse-bearers there shall wash their hair and their
bodies!” ‘
12. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the
urine wherewith the corpse-bearers shall wash their hair and their bodies? Is it of sheep or of oxen? Is it of man or of woman?
13. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is of sheep or of oxen; not of man nor of woman, except a man or a woman who has married the next
of-kin:398 these shall therefore procure the urine wherewith the corpse-bearers shall wash their hair and their bodies.’399 III.

voluntarily commits the unnatural sin, what is the penalty for it? What is the atonement for it? What is the cleansing from it?
Ahura Mazda answered: ‘For that deed there is nothing that can pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from it; it is a
trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever and ever.’ 28.414 When is it so?
‘It is so if the sinner be a professor of the Religion of Mazda, or one who has been taught in it.

419 ‘This principle still prevails even with Moslem Persians: ‘Pour encourir leur immondicité; dans l’attouchement des Chrétiens et autres idolatres, il est nécessaire que s’ils les touchent, leurs vētements soient mouillés.

430 The water is shed from a spoon, tied to a long stick, ‘the stick with nine knots’ (Vd9.14). 431 Bareshnum; from which word the whole of the operation has taken its name.
432 The Nasu is expelled symmetrically, from limb to limb, from the right side of the body to the left, from the forepart to the back parts, and she flies, thus pursued, downwards from the top of the head to the tips of the toes. The retreating order of the Nasu is just the reverse of the order in which she invaded the different members of the first man: she entered Gayomard by the little toe of the left foot, then went up to the heart, then to the shoulder, at last to the summit of the head (Gr. Bd.) Death still seizes the foot first.

437 A new fire is kindled from the Nasu-burning fire: this new fire is disposed in such a way that it should die out soon: before it has died out, they kindle a new fire from it and so on for nine times: the ninth fire, derived from the one impure, through seven intermediate fires, more and more distant from the original impurity, will represent the fire in its native purity and can enter into the composition of a Warharan fire. — On the modern process, see Dosabhoy Framji, History of the Parsis, II, 113.

FARGARD 9. The Nine Nights’ Barashnum.
On the name Barashnom, see Vd8.40, note 50. Synopsis.

Barashnom-gah). I b (12-36) Description of the cleansing. II (37-44). Fees of the cleanser. III (47-57). The false cleanser; his punishment. §§ 45, 46 belong better to the following Fargard.
The ceremony described in this Fargard is known among the
Parsis as barashnom no shaba, or ‘nine nights’ Barashnom,’ because it lasts for nine nights (see § 35). It is the great purification, the most
efficacious of all; it not only makes the defiled man clean, but it opens to him the heavens (see Vd19.33). So, although it was formerly
intended only for the man defiled by the dead, it became, during the Parsi period, a pious work which might be performed without any
corpse having been touched; nay, its performance was prescribed, once at least, at the time of the Nū zūdī [Navjote -JHP] (at the age of
fifteen, when the young Parsi becomes a member of the community), in order to wash away the natural uncleanness that has been
contracted in the maternal womb (Saddar 36). It must also be undergone by a priest who wants to appear before the Warharan fire
or perform the Yasna or the Vendidad office. Translation.

FARGARD 10. Formulas recited during the process of cleansing
Introduction.
Nowadays, before laying the dead in the coffin, two priests recite
the Ahunavaiti Gatha (Yasna 28-34): it is the so-called Gāh sārnā (chanting of the Gathas: gāthāo srāvayēiti). From the following
Fargard it appears that formerly all the five Gathas and the Yasna Haptanghaiti were recited. Certain stanzas were recited several times
and with a certain emphasis (framrava): and they were followed with certain spells. The object of this Fargard is to show which are those
stanza; how many times each was recited, and to give the corresponding spells.

refer to the particular objects to he cleansed, such as the house, the fire1 the water, the earth, the animals, the plants, the man defiled with
the dead. Each incantation consists of two parts, a line from the Gathas which alludes, or rather is made to allude, to the particular
object (§§ 4, 5, 6, 7), and a general exorcism, in the usual dialect (§§ 820), which is the same for all the objects. Translation.

FARGARD 12. The Upaman, how long it lasts for different relatives
Introduction.
This chapter is found only in the Vendidad Sada; it is missing in
the Zand-Pahlavi Vendidad. This is owing, as it seems, only to the accidental loss of some folios in the one manuscript from which all the
copies as yet known have been derived; and, in fact, even in the most ancient manuscripts the following Fargard is numbered the thirteenth
(Westergaard, Zend-Avesta, preface, p. 5).
The directions in the preceding chapter are general, and do not
depend on the relationship of the faithful with the deceased person; whereas those in this Fargard are of a special character, and apply
only to the near relatives of the dead. Their object is to determine how long the time of ‘staying’ (upaman) should last for different relatives.
What is meant by this word is not explained; but, as the word upaman is usually employed to indicate the staying of the unclean in the
Armesht-gah, apart from the faithful and from every clean object, that word upaman seems to show a certain period of mourning, marked
by abstention from usual avocations.
The length of the upaman varies with the degrees of relationship;.
and at every degree it is double for relations who have died in a state of sin (that is, with a sin not redeemed by the Patet: see Vd9.49 note
30). The relative length of the upaman is as follows:-
For the head of a family (§ 7): 6 months (or a
year).
First degree.
(For father or mother (§1)) For son or daughter (§ 3) For brother or sister (§ 5):
30 days (or 60).
Second degree.
For grandfather or grandmother (§ 9)
For grandson or granddaughter (§ 11): 25 days (or 50). Third degree. For uncle or aunt (§ 13): 20 days (or 40). Fourth
degree. For male cousin or female cousin (§ 15): 15 days (or 30).
Fifth degree. For the son or daughter of a cousin (§ 17): 10 days (or 20). Sixth degree. For the grandson or the granddaughter of a cousin
(§ 19): 5 days (or 10).

with the Aspahe-astra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshocharana.’569
25. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall give bad food to a house-dog, what is the penalty that he shall pay?
Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Ninety stripes with the Aspahe-astra, ninety stripes with the Sraosho-charana.’
567 The Vohunazga dog has no domicile, therefore he is not compared with the master of a house, but with a wandering friar, who lives on charity.
568 Probably, ‘Who has performed the nu-zud [navjote -JHP], fifteen years old.’ The young dog enters the community of the faithful at the age of four months, when he is fit for the Sag-did and can expel the Nasu.
569 ‘I also saw the soul of a man, whom demons, just like dogs, ever tear. That man gives bread to the dogs, and they eat it not; but they ever devour the breast, legs, belly, and thighs of the man. And I asked thus: What sin was committed by this body, whose soul suffers so severe a punishment? Srosh the pious and Atar the angel said thus: This is the soul of that wicked man who, in the world, kept back the food of the dogs of shepherds and house-holders; or beat and killed them’ (Arda Viraf 48, translated by Haug).

29. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be in the house of a worshipper of Mazda a mad dog that bites without

around his neck, and they shall tie thereto a muzzle, an asti572 thick if the wood be hard, two astis thick if it be soft. To that collar they shall
tie it; by the two sides573 of the collar they shall tie it.

FARGARD 14. Atoning for the murder of a waterdog
Synopsis.
This Fargard is nothing more than an appendix to the last clauses
in the preceding Fargard (§ 50 seq.) How the murder of a water-dog (an otter) may be atoned for is described in it at full length. The
extravagance of the penalties prescribed may well make it doubtful whether the legislation of the Vendidad had ever any substantial
existence in practice. These exorbitant prescriptions seem to be intended only to impress on the mind of the faithful the heinousness
of the offense to be avoided.
Translation.
1. Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: ‘O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! He
who smites one of those water-dogs that are born one from a thousand dogs and a thousand she-dogs,596 so that he gives up the
ghost and the soul parts from the body, what is the penalty that he shall pay?’
2. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘He shall pay ten thousand stripes with the Aspahe-astra, ten thousand stripes with the Sraosho-charana.597
‘He shall godly and piously bring unto the fire of Ahura Mazda598 ten thousand loads of hard, well dried, well examined599 wood, to
redeem his own soul.
3. ‘He shall godly and piously, bring unto the fire of Ahura Mazda
ten thousand loads of soft wood, of Urvasna, Vohu-gaona, Vohukereti, Hadha-naepata,600 or any sweet-scented plant, to redeem his
own soul.
596 See preceding Fargard § 51.
597 He shall pay 50 tanapuhrs (= 15,000 istirs = 60,000 dirhems). If he can afford it, he will alone in the manner stated in the Avesta; if he cannot afford it, it will be sufficient to perform a complete Izashne [Yasna -JHP] (sacrifice),’ (Comm.) 598 To the altar of the Warharan fire.
599 It is forbidden to take any ill-smelling thing to the fire and to kindle it thereon; it is forbidden to kindle green wood, and even though the wood were hard and dry, one must examine it three times, lest there may be any hair or any unclean matter upon it, (Gr. Riv.) Although the pious Arda Viraf had always taken the utmost care never to put on the fire any wood but such as was seven years old, yet, when he entered Paradise, Atar, the genius of fire, showed him reproachfully a large tank full of the water which that wood had exuded (see Arda Viraf 10). 600 See above, Vd8.2, note 4.

4. ‘He shall godly and piously tie ten thousand bundles of

libations with the Haoma and the milk, cleanly prepared and well strained, cleanly prepared and well strained by a pious man, and
mixed with the roots of the tree known as Hadha-naepata, to redeem his own soul.
5. ‘He shall kill ten thousand snakes of those that go upon the belly. He shall kill ten thousand Kahrpus, who are snakes with the
shape of a dog.601 He shall hill ten thousand tortoises.602 He shall kill ten thousand land-frogs;603 he shall kill ten thousand water-frogs. He
shall kill ten thousand corn-carrying ants;604 he shall kill ten thousand ants of the small, venomous mischievous kind.605
6. ‘He shall kill ten thousand worms of those that live on dirt; he shall kill ten thousand raging flies.606 ‘He shall fill up ten thousand holes for the unclean.607
601 ‘Mār bānak snakes: they are dog-like, because they sit on their hindparts’ (Comm.) The cat (gurba = Kahrpu) seems to be the animal intended. In a paraphrase of this passage in a Parsi Rivayat, the cat is numbered amongst the Khrafstras which it is enjoined to kill to redeem a sin (India Office Library, VIII, 13); cf. G. du Chinozi, p. 462: ‘Les animaux que les Gaures ont en horreur sont les serpents, les couleuvres, les lezars, et autres de cette espece, les crapaux, lea grenouilles, lea écrevisses, les rats et souris, et sur tout le chat.’ 602 See Vd8.6-7.
603 ‘Those that can go out of water and live on the dry ground’ (Comm.) ‘Pour les grenouilles et crapaux, ils disent que ce sont ceux (eux?) qui sont cause de ce que les hommes meurent, gātans les eaus où ils habitent continuellement, et que d’autant plus qu’il y en a dans le païs, d’autant plus lea caus causent-elles des maladies et enfin la mort,’ G. du Chinon, p.465.
604 Herodotus already mentions the war waged by the Magi against snakes and ants (I, 140).-- ‘Un jour que j’étois surpris de la guerre qu’ils font aux fourmis, ils me dirent que ces animaux ne faisaient que voler par des amas des grains plus qu’il n’étoit nécessaire pour leur nourriture,’ G. du Chinon, p.464. Firdausi protested against the proscription: ‘Do no harm to the corn-carrying ant; a living thing it is, and its life is dear to it.’ The celebrated high-priest of the Parsis, the late Moola Firooz, entered those lines into his Pand Nāmah, which may betoken better days for the wise little creature.
605 Perhaps: ‘of the small, venomous kind, with a mischievous track’ (Bd19.28: when the grain-carrier travels over the earth, it produces a hollow track: when the hedgehog travels over it, the track goes away from it and it becomes level:’ cf.

teaches one of the faithful another faith, another law,635 a lower doctrine, and he leads him astray with a full knowledge and
conscience of the sin: the man who has done the deed becomes a Peshotanu.

8. ‘It is the fifth of these sins when a man has intercourse with a

being ashamed of the people, produce in herself the menses, against the course of nature, by means of water and plants.642
10. ‘And if the damsel, being ashamed of the people, shall produce in herself the menses gainst the course of nature, by means of water

Introduction to Fargard 17.
Anything that has been separated from the body of man is considered dead matter (nasu), and is accordingly unclean. As soon as
hair and nails are cut off, the demon takes hold of them and has to he driven away from them by spells, in the same way as he is from the
bodies of the dead.

Queries, 3rd series, X, 146; Aulus Gellius, X, 15, 15; Méusine, 1878, pp.79, 549, 583; L. de Rosny, Histoire des dynasties divines, 308. Translation.

shalt comb thy hair or shave it off, or pare off thy nails, thou shalt take them away ten paces from the faithful, twenty paces from the fire,
thirty paces from the water, fifty paces from the consecrated bundles of Baresma.

698 The Kusti, which must he worn by every Parsi, man or woman, from their fifteenth year of age (see below, § 54 seq); it is the badge of the faithful, the girdle by which he is united both with Ohrmazd and with his fellow-believers. He who does not wear it must be refused water and bread by the members of the community; he who wears it becomes a participator in the merit of all the good deeds performed all over the Zarathustrian world (Saddar 10 and Saddar 46). The Kusti consists ‘of seventy-two interwoven filaments, and should three times circumvent the waist. ... Each of the threads is equal in value to one of the seventy-two Has of the Yasna; each of the twelve threads in the six lesser cords is equal in value to the dawazdih hamaist...; each of the lesser cords is equal in value to one of the six Gahambars; each of the three circumventions of the loins is equal in value to humat, good thought, hukht, good speech, huaresta, good work; the binding of each of the four knots upon it confers pleasure on each of the four elements, fire, air, water, and the earth’ (Edal Daru, apud Wilson, The Parsi Religion Unfolded, p. 163). Another piece of clothing which every Parsi is enjoined to wear is the Sudre, or sacred shirt, a muslin shirt with short sleeves, that does not reach lower than the hips, with a small pocket at the opening in front of the shirt, the so-called giriban or kissai karfa, ‘the pocket for good deeds.’ The faithful man must, while putting on his Sudre, look at the giriban and ask himself whether it is full of good deeds. 699 See Introd.

FARGARD 19.
Synopsis.
I (§§ 1-3). Angra Mainyu sends the demon Buiti to kill Zarathushtra: Zarathushtra sings aloud the Ahunwar, and the demon
flies away, confounded by the sacred words and by the glory of Zarathushtra.
Ia (§§ 4-10). Angra Mainyu himself attacks him and propounds riddles to be solved under pain of death. The Prophet rejects him with
heavenly stones, given by Ahura, and announces to him that he will destroy his creation. The demon promises him the empire of the
world if he adores him, as his ancestors have done, and abjures the religion of Mazda. Zarathushtra rejects his offers scornfully. He
announces he will destroy him with the arms given by Ahura, namely, the sacrificial implements and the sacred words. Then he recites the
Tat thwa peresa, that is to say, the Gatha in which he asks Ahura for instruction on all the mysteries of the material and spiritual world.
The rest of the Fargard contains specimens of the several questions asked by Zarathushtra and the answers given by Ahura. It is an
abridgement of the Revelation (cf. HN).
II (11-17). How to destroy the uncleanness born from a contact
with the dead? — By invoking the Mazdean Religion. A series of invocations taught by Ahura and developed by Zarathushtra (15-16)
III (18-19). How to promote the prosperity of the creation? — By the rites of the Baresman [barsom].
IV (20-25). How to purify man and clothes defiled by the dead? With gomez, water, and perfume.
V (26-34). On the remuneration of deeds after death; on the fate of the wicked and the righteous; the Chinwad bridge. IIa (34-42). Another series of invocations.
VI (43-47). The demons, dismayed by the birth of the Prophet,
rush back into hell.
As may be seen from the preceding analysis, the essential part of
this Fargard are sections I and VI, the rest being an indefinite development. It appears also from section VI, that the attacks of Buiti
and Angra Mainyu against Zarathushtra and the attempts to seduce him are supposed to take place at the moment when he was born,
which is confirmed by the testimony of the Warsht-mansr Nask (West, Pahlavi Texts, IV, 226 seq.)

Translation. I.
1. From the region of the north, from the regions of the north,747
forth rushed Angra Mainyu, the deadly, the Daeva of the Daevas.748 And thus spake the evil-doer Angra Mainyu, the deadly: ‘Druj, rush
down and kill him,’ O holy Zarathushtra! The Druj came rushing along, the demon Buiti,749 who is deceiving, unseen death.750
2. Zarathushtra chanted aloud the Ahuna-Vairya:751 ‘The will of the Lord is the law of righteousness. The gifts of Vohu-mano to the deeds
done in this world for Mazda. He who relieves the poor makes Ahura king.’
He offered the sacrifice to the good waters of the good Daitya!752 He recited the profession of the worshippers of Mazda!753
The Druj dismayed, rushed away, the demon Buiti, who is deceiving, unseen death.
3. And the Druj said unto Angra Mainyu: ‘Thou, tormenter, Angra Mainyu! I see no way to kill Spitama Zarathushtra, so great is the
glory of the holy Zarathushtra.’
Zarathushtra saw (all this) within his soul: ‘The wicked, the evil
doing Daevas (thought he) take counsel together for my death.’ I a.

749 Buiti is identified by the Gr. Bd. with the Būt, the idol, worshipped by Budasp (a corruption of Bodhisativa). Buiti [Buddha] would be therefore a personification of Buddhism, which was flourishing in Eastern Iran in the two centuries before and after Christ.

‘Whereat on this wide, round earth, whose ends lie afar, whereat
dost thou swing (those stones), thou who standest by the upper bank of the river Dareja,757 in the mansion of Pourushaspa?’758
5. Thus Zarathushtra answered Angra Mainyu: ‘O evil-doer, Angra Mainyu! I will smite the creation of the Daeva; I will smite the Nasu, a
creature of the Daeva; I will smite the Pairika Knathaiti,759 till the victorious Saoshyant come up to life760 out of the lake Kasava
[Kasaoya],761 from the region of the dawn, from the regions of the dawn.’
6. Again to him said the Maker of the evil world, Angra Mainyu: ‘Do not destroy my creatures, O holy Zarathushtra! Thou art the son
of Pourushaspa;762 by thy mother I was invoked.763 Renounce the good Religion of the worshippers of Mazda, and thou shalt gain such a boon
as Vadhaghna764 gained, the ruler of the nations.’
7. Spitama Zarathushtra said in answer: ‘No! never will I renounce
the good Religion of the worshippers of Mazda, either for body or life, though they should tear away the breath!’

756 The Commentary has, ‘Some say, those stones are the Ahunwar.’ If one keeps in mind how much the Moslem legend of Ibrahim owes to the legend of Zarathushtra, one may easily admit that this passage in our text is the origin of the story of how Iblis tempted Ibrahim, and was pelted away, whence he was named ‘the stoned One’ (ar-ragīmū).

760 The unborn son of Zarathushtra, who, at the end of time, will destroy Ahriman and bring about the resurrection of the dead. See Yt13.62; Yt19.92, 94 seq. 761 The Zarah sea in Saistan. See Yt19.66. 762 ‘I know thee’ (Comm.)
763 The Commentary has, ‘Some explain thus: Thy forefathers worshipped me: worship me also.’ Zarathushtra’s forefathers must naturally have followed a false religion, since he announces the true one.
764 Azhi Dahaka or Zohak, who, as a legendary king, is said to have ruled the world for a thousand years. See Mx57.24-25: “Ahriman shouted to Zartosht thus: ‘If thou desist from this good religion of the Mazda-worshippers, then I will give thee a thousand years’ dominion of the worldly existence, as was given to the Vadakan monarch Dahak [Zohak].’”

782 Rata impersonates the liberalities done by men to God (as offerings) and by God to men (as riches, etc.).
783 Vohu-mano is often used as a designation of the faithful one, literally, ‘the goodminded;’ this is the meaning which is given to it in this passage by the Commentary, and it certainly belongs to it in the second part of verse 24; but in the first part of the same clause it is translated ‘clothes,’ a meaning which is not unlikely in itself, as Vohu-mano, being the Amahraspand of cattle, may designate, and in fact did designate, the skins of cattle and leather (Comm. ad Farg. XVIII, 2). On the whole the description in the text applies to the cleansing both of the man and of the clothes, and Vohu-mano sometimes means the one, and sometimes the other. — From the first meaning is derived the modern use of Vahman, ‘Such a one,’ ‘N.’ 784 From dead bodies.

796 The Chinwad bridge extends over hell and leads to Paradise; for the souls of the righteous it widens to the length of nine javelins; for the souls of the wicked it narrows to a thread, and they fall down into hell (see Arda Viraf 5.1; Dk. Book 9, chapter 20.3). The Chinwad bridge has become the Sirath bridge of the Moslems. Not long ago they sang in Yorkshire of ‘the Brig o’ Dread, na brader than a thread’ (Thorns, Anecdotes, 89), and even nowadays the peasants in Nièvre tells of a little board— ‘Pas pu longue, pas pu large / Qu’un ch’veu de la Sainte Viarge,’ which was put by Saint Jean d’Archange between the earth and Paradise: ‘Ceux qu’saront la raison (=l’oraison?) d’Dieu / Par dessus passeront. / Ceux qu’la sauront pas / Au bout mourront.’ (Mélusine, p. 70.) 797 See verse 26, and Vd3.34-5; Vd18.33 ff.

FARGARD 20. Thrita, the first healer.
Synopsis.
It has already been seen (Farg. VII, 44) that there are three kinds of medicine one that heals with the knife, one that heals with herbs,
and one that heals with sacred spells. The present Fargard deals with the origin of medicine, particularly the herbs-medicine. Its inventor
was Thrita, of the Sāma family, to whom Ahura Mazda brought down from heaven ten thousand healing plants that had been growing up
around the tree of eternal life, the white Hom or Gaokerena (§ 4).
This Thrita is mentioned only once again in the Avesta, in Yasna
9.7, where he appears to have been one of the first priests of Haoma. This accounts for his medical skill; as Haoma is the plant of eternal
life, it is but natural that one of his first priests should have been the first healer.
This Fargard has only an allusion to the origin of the knifemedicine [surgery], which was, as it seems, revealed by Khshathra
Vairya (§ 3). The last paragraphs (§§ 5-12) deal with the spellmedicine.
The functions ascribed here to Thrita were sometimes conferred on his semi-namesake Thraetaona [Faridoon] (see Westergaard
Fragments, II). Hamza makes Thraetaona the inventor of medicine (Ed Gottwaldt, p. 23; cf. Mirkhond, Early Kings of Persia, tr. by Shea,
p. 152); the Tavīds (formulas of exorcism) against sickness are inscribed with his name, and we find in the Avesta itself his Fravashi
invoked ‘against itch, hot fever, humours, cold fever (Vd7.58), incontinence, against the plagues created by the serpent (Yt13.131).’
We see from the last words of this passage that disease was understood as coming from the serpent; in other words, that it was
considered a sort of poisoning,850 and this is the reason why the killer of the serpent (Azi-Dahaka) [Zohak] was invoked to act against it. Translation.
1. Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: ‘Ahura Mazda, most
beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who was he who first of the healers,851 of the wise, the happy, the wealthy,
the glorious, the strong, the Paradhatas,852 drove back sickness to
850 This theory, which modern science would not utterly reject, accounts for the great part which the serpent plays in the worship of Asclepius; as sickness comes from him, from him too must or may come the healing.

sickness, drove back death to death;853 and first turned away the point

2. Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Thrita it was who first of the healers, of

854 As Khshathra-Vairya presides over metals, it was a knife he received, ‘of which the point and the base were set in gold.’ He was therefore the first who healed with the knife, as well as the first who healed with herbs. As for the healing with the holy word, see § 5 and seq. 855 Headache and cold fever.
856 There are two Haomas: one is the yellow or golden Haoma, which is the earthly Haoma, and which, when prepared for the sacrifice, is the king of healing plants; the other is the white Haoma or Gaokerena, which grows up in the middle of the sea Vouru-Kasha, where it is surrounded by the ten thousand healing plants, created by Ohrmazd in order to oppose so many diseases that had been created by Ahriman (Bd9; see Vd22.2). A frog goes swimming around the Gaokerena to gnaw it down: but two Kar Mahi (Vd19.42) keep watch and circle around the tree, so that the head of one of them is continually towards the frog (Bd18).
857 We do all that is necessary for healing; we give, as Dastobar (Dastur), the necessary prescriptions; we recite the needed prayers. — This section is a transition to the spell-medicine.

FARGARD 21. Healing spells
Synopsis. I (1). Praise of the holy bull. II (2-3). Invocation addressed to rain as a healing power.
III a (4-7). Joint invocation addressed to the waters and to the light of the sun.
III b (8-11). Joint invocation addressed to the waters and to the light of the moon.
III c (12-17). Joint invocation addressed to the waters and to the light of the stars. IV (18-21), Spells against disease.
The largest part of this Fargard is filled with a uniform spell,
intended, as it seems, for the protection of lying-in women (§§ 6-7, 1011, 14-15), who are under the special care of Ardvi Sura Anahita, the
great goddess of the waters. That spell is repeated three times, in a joint invocation to the sun, to the moon, and to the stars respectively;
that strange association is perhaps owing to the fact that both the light and the waters spring up from the Hara Berezaiti and return
there (see § 4, note 1).

869 Waters and light are believed to flow from the same spring and in the same bed: ‘As the light comes in through Alburz (Hara Berezaiti) and goes out through Alburz, so water also comes out through Alburz and goes away through Alburz’ (Bd20.4). Every day the sun, moon, and stars rise up from Alburz, and every day all the waters on the earth come back together to the sea Vouru-kasha, and there collected come down again to the earth from the peaks of Alburz (Gr. Riv. 43’). As light comes from three different sources (the sun, the moon, and the stars), the waters are invoked three times, first in company with the sun, then with the moon, lastly with the stars, as if there should be three different movements of the rain connected with the three movements or light.
870 Waters come down from the sky to the earth and rise back from the earth to the sky (see Vd5.15 seq.) 871 ‘If thou art a righteous man’ (Comm.) 872 The translation of this clause is doubtful.
873 The spell refers to the cleansing and generative power of the waters; cf. the invocation to Ardvi Sura, Vd7.16: the waters are supposed to make females fertile as they make the earth. This spell was probably pronounced to facilitate childbirth.

FARGARD 22. Angra Mainyu creates 99,999 diseases; Ahura Mazda counters with the Holy Manthra and with Airyaman
Synopsis.
It has already been seen that of all healers, the most powerful is the one who treats with the Holy Word (Manthra Spenta), that is with
sacred spells (Vd7.44): Of all sacred spells, the most efficacious is the Airyema ishyo, which forms the fifty-fourth Ha of the Yasna. This is
expressed under a mythological form in the following Fargard (cf. Westergaard’s Fragments, IV).
Angra Mainyu having created 99,999 diseases, Ahura applies for remedy to the Holy Word (Manthra Spenta; §§ 1-5). — How shall I
manage? asks Manthra Spenta (§ 16). Ahura sends his messenger to Airyaman with the same request.
This Fargard is unfinished or, more correctly, the end of it is understood. Airyaman comes at once to Ahura’s call, and digs nine
furrows. It is no doubt in order to perform the Barashnom, by the virtue of which the strength of the demon and of the demon’s work
will be broken. The Fargard ends therefore with spells against sickness and agailist death, added to the usual spells of the ordinary
Barashnom.
