James B. Pritchard is Professor of Old Testa
ment Literature at the Church Divinity
School of the Pacific in Berkeley, California.
He is the editor of Ancient Near Eastern
Texts Relating to the Old Testa1nent and
author of The Ancient Near East in Pictures
Relating to the Old Testament, from both
of which materials have been drawn in the
writing of tl1is book. Professor Pritcl1ard has
also been an arcl1aeologist in the field, and
his recent excavation of tl1e ancient biblical
city of Gibeo11 l1as been '\'idely praisecl.

PREFACE
ARCI-IAE<)LOGY is a science in \vhicl1 prog1·ess can be meas
t11·ecl by tl1e adva11ces made back\vard into the past. The
last one l1u11dred years of arcl1aeology have added a score
of centt11·ies to the story of the gro\vth of our cultt1ral and
i·elig·ious l1eritag·e, as tl1e ancient \Vorld has been recovered
from tl1e sands ancl caves of the modern Near East Egypt,
Jord<111, Is1·ael, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq. Meas
ured by the number of centuries 'vhich have been annexed
to inan's l1istory in a relatively fe,v years, progress has been
trt1ly phenomenal. This book deals \Vith the recent ad
vance and 'vith those pioneers to the past who made it pos
sible.
Inte1·est in biblical history has played an important part
in this recovery. Names such as Babylon, Nineveh, Jericho,
Jerusalem, and otl1ers prominent on the pages of the Bible,
11ave gripped tl1e popular imagination and worked like
magic to gain suppo1·t for excavations. 'This book is written
from the widely-sl1ared conviction that the discovery of
the ancient Near East has shed significant light on the
Bible. Indeed, the ne\vly-discovered ancient world has ef
fected a revolution in the understanding of the Bible, its
peoples, and their history.
My purpose is to assess, in non-technical language which
the layman can understand, the kind of change in viewing
tl1e biblical past which archaeology has brought about in
the last century. Since the text of the Bible has remained
constant over this period, it is obvious that any new light
on its meaning must provide a better perspective for seeing
the events which it describes. In short, I am concerned
with the question, How has history as written in the Bible
been changed, enlarged, or substantiated by the past cen
tury of archaeological work?

PREFACE
011e might suppose tl1at tl1e story of arcl1aeology i11
Palesti11e, tl1e la11d of tl1e Bible, 'vould provide tl1e ans,ver
to tl1e question. But it has supplied only a part of tl1e rele
vant data. One of ! lie surprises of modern arcl1aeological
discovery has been tl1at tl1e peripl1eral lands of Mesopo
tamia, Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia have added to biblical
knowledge. From eacl1 of tl1ese neigl1boring areas 11ave
come 'vritten documents and monuments of great impor
tance for an understanding of tl1e life, literature, and his
tory of the peoples of Palestine, and any fair appraisal of
archaeology's contribution to an understanding of the
Bible must take into account these widely scattered re
•
mains.
Whenever possible, I l1ave tried to let the evidence speak
for itself. In presenting the picture of new material made
available by archaeologists, I have sought to place before
the reader a translation of a relevant document or a photo
graph of a significant archaeological object. Tl1ese trans
lations and pictures, for the most part, are taken from t'vo
large collections wl1icl1 I have edited for the use of scholars
and advanced students in the field of Old Testa111e11t
studies. Ancient Nea1· Easter11 Texts Relati11g to t/1e Old

PREFACE
As tl1e field of Near Eastern archaeology is immense, it
can be readily understood that tl1is volume is intended to
serve only as an introdt1ction to a study of those results of
the past century wl1ich relate to tl1e Bible. Obviously, one
who is at home in tl1is field of researcl1 'vill miss much
which may be of importance to 11im. 111 g·eneral, I l1ave
tried to choose those examples 'vl1icl1 can be understood by
the layman who has had no occasion to study tl1e la11guages
of the ancient Near East, and who has not concerned him
self with the more minute problems of philology and
history.

·1· HE ESSENTIAL ALP HABE'f ()l' ARC I-IAEO LOGY
THE science of Palesti11ian arcl1aeolog·y \Vas born in tl1e
spring of 1890, \vhen a rare genius, W. M. Flinders Petrie,
found an ancient mound of buried cities \Vorthy of his
ability to observe and interpret. In a scant six \veeks of dig
ging, this pio11eer set tl1e pattern for over l1alf a century of
excavations. Otl1ers, to be sure, l1ad dug in Palestine be
fore, but none l1ad l1it t1pon a sure means for dating tl1e
ancient ruins \Vl1icl1 l1e l1ad t1ncovered. It remained for
Petrie to discover tl1e secret of metl1od.
Petrie \Vas a11 Egyptolog·ist \vl10 l1ad been asked by tl1e
Palestine Explo1-ation Ft1nd of Er1glancl to direct its ex
cavation in sot1tl1ern Judal1. Altl1ougl1 l1e \Vas only thirty
seven years old at tl1e time, 11e 11ad a decade of experience
to his credit in Eg·ypt; and th1-ot1g·J1 tl1e publication of ten
arcl1aeological volt1111es l1e 11ad lnacle a considerable rept1
tatior1for11i1nself. A st1m of £1, 110 11ad been raised, mostly
from l1undreds of small gifts i11 respo11se to a special a1Jpeal

Englisl1 novelist of tl1e time, l1ad servecl as secretary a11(l
fina11cial geni11s. Years of patient effort l1ad finally res11 lte<l
in permission to carry on excavations granted IJy tl1e
Turks, \vho at the time 1·uled Palestine.
Tl1is first arcl1aeologist to excavate scientifically in Pales
tine began his serious study of tl1e ancient past even be

just ten years before 11e died, to \vrite 11is at1tobiog·r;1pl1y
under tl1e startling but accurate title of Seve11ty Yea1·s i11

books 'vritte11 lie 'vas respo11sible in 'vl1ole or in pa1·t fo1·
ninety-eig·l1t volumes, not to mention a g1·eat 11u1nber of
scientific and popular articles 11e 11as as yet 11ad no rival.
Petrie's first archaeological expedition 'vas in 1880, 'vl1e11
he 'vent out from England to Egypt to attempt to measure
accurately the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. He 11ad been led
into this venture some fourteen years earlier by the pur
chase of a curious book 'vritten by Piazzi Smytl1, Our !11
heritance in the Great Pyramid, a work of fantastic theo
ries based on an an1azing· correlation so Smytl1 alleg·ed
between tl1e measurements of tl1e Great Pyramid and tl1e
history of the world as it is 'vritten in tl1e Bible. Petrie's
father, wl10 was a friend of Piazzi S1nytl1, encouraged tl1c
young Flinders to enter tl1is enticing field of see1ni11g· ct>
incidence. Alas, tl1e facts establisl1ed tl1rougl1 tl1e pai11stak
i11g labor of this first seaso11 at Gizel1 did not su ppo1·t
Smyth's tl1eory, but in tl1e demonstration of its fallacy
Petrie l1ad found l1is career.
Many yea1·s later, as 11e looked back at tl1e clay l1e fJt11·
cl1ased Smytl1's book, Si1- Fli11ders reflected: ''I little
tl1ougl1t, !10,v, fifteen years later, I sl1ould 1·eacl1 'tl1e t1g·Iy

In March of 1890, Flinders Petrie arrived in Palestine,

finally, as a one-man archaeological expedition, made his
\vay to the supposed site of ancient Eglon. Arriving at a
camping place, he pitched his tent and fell asleep.

'l'HE SCIENCE OF PALESTINIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
''Dt1ring· tl1e nig·l1t I 'vas a'voke," he 'v1·ote in his report
to tl1e sponso1·i11g Palestine Ex1)loratio11 Funcl. ''by a dog
getting in, and ag·ain by a sligl1t noise, and looking· up, sa\v
a gap in tl1e tent in it, a man's head and shot1lders, and
heard tl1e intrude1· fumbling over tl1e tool-bag, too heavy
to carry off, and a'vk'''ard to open. I challe11g·ed, 11e ran,
and four bullets 'vent over his head to improve his pace."3
Such incidents vvere not unusual in the early days of ex
cavations in Turkish Palestine.
The next day Petrie 'vas off to see the site to 'vhich the
Fund had sent him. Alas, there 'vas only a little b1·oken pot
tery lying about, and what there 'vas belonged to the Ro
man period. This, 11e concluded, surely could not be tl1e
ancient Eglon, the prominent biblical city. He moved to
a place 'vhicl1 bore the name of Lachish, but after tl1ree
days of work there he 'vas persuaded that neither 'vas this
the site of the ancient Judaean city wl1ich bore that name.
Six miles from his camp, however, he found a mound,
called by the Arabs Tell el-Hesi, 'vhere there 'vas an abt1n
dance of ancient pottery, a site which he judged 'vas
''worth a dozen of all the other places put together." And
it was at this site, sixteen miles east of Gaza, that tl1e
science of Palestinian archaeology 'vas born. Althot1gl1
Petrie mistakenly thot1gl1t of it as the ancient Lacl1isl1, it
now seems likely that it 'vas actually tl1e ancient Eg·lo11, tl1e
supposed identification of tl1e place to ,vJ1icl1 Pet1·ie l1ad at

Tell el-Hesi 'vas a mo11nd of earth meas11ring abot1t 200

100 feet above tl1e plain. Tl1e eastern side had been eaten
a'vay by the erosion of tl1e 'vater of the stream Wadi Hesi,
turning this side of tl1e mound into a cliff sloping at abo11t
a 45-degree angle.

and plans, not to return to dig again in Palestine for over

THE SCIENCE OF PALESTINIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
Unable to persuade Petrie to leave his chosen field of
Egypt for another season, the officers of the Palestine Ex
ploration Fund found an American, F. J. Bliss, the son of
the president of the Syrian Protestant College (later the
American University of Beirut), and engaged him to con
tinue the work. After a short apprenticeship with Petrie
at Meidum in Egypt, Bliss went to Tell el-Hesi. By Janu
ary of 1893 he had cut away about one-third of the ancient
tell, down through 65 feet of debris, laying bare the re
mains of eight cities (Fig. 4).
The labor of almost three years of digging disappoint
ingly produced no artifacts for museum display. The only
object of value was a clay tablet, measuring 2 by 2V2 in
ches, with twenty-six lines of cuneiform writing, ,,,l1ich
Bliss found in what he called city III. The tablet could be
dated to the time of the famous Egyptian king Akh-en
Aton, in the fourteenth century B.c., and mentioned the
well-known prince of Lachish, Zimreda.0 This object
served to date the layer and the pottery in it. Everything
below this must be older than the fourteenth century; the
cities above it were, of course, later.
But the importance of this early excavation in Palestine
cannot be measured in terms of museum pieces. The great
discovery 'vas the demonstration by Petrie and Bliss tl1at
the l1istory of ancient Palestine 'vas '''ritten in the forms
and shapes of broken fragments of pottery.
In the early days of arcl1aeolog·y excavators had searched
only for treasure, often plt1nderi11g· tl1e past for museums,
'vhicl1, as Petrie once remarked, are ''g·I1astly cl1arnel-houses
of murdered evidence." 7 Careful observation of tl1e circt1m
stances and context of discoveries had been conspicuot1sly
absent, as had been attention to the small but t1niversal
things such as potsherds. In such a monumental pt1blica

revised, and improved since Petrie first proposed the pri11
ciple that pottery is ''tl1e essential alpl1abet of arcl1aeolo
gy," but the principle remains tl1e same.
Attention 'vas given first of all to for111 particularly tl1e
shapes of handles, rims, and bases; the11 to decoratio11,
such as combing on tl1e '''et st11·face, pai11ting, and bt1rn
ishing of the leatl1er-hard vessel 'vitl1 a pebble before
firing; and finally to the texture of tl1e clay and tl1e 'vay i11
'vhich the pottery had been fired in tl1e kiln. Combinations
of these factors made possible many distinctive variations,
each of which seemed to hold for a time and then to be
superseded by a ne\v type. The fragile nature of pottery
accounts for the great number and variety of broken pieces
preserved. Once a pot 'vas broken it had to be replaced,
and the preference \Vas for a newer style. Tl1us it 'vas tl1at
cl1anges took place rapidly in form, sl1ape, and decoration.
Petrie estimated that during his six 'veeks at Tell el
Hesi he must have looked over 50,000 or more }Jieces of
pottery, 'vhile in Egypt, l1e said, ''about 3,000,000 pieces
have been clearly looked at by me." 8 Tl1is is the essential
business of tl1e arcl1aeologist, '''!10 sl1ould be kno'''l1 for tl1e
sl1ortness of his finger-nails and tl1e tougl1ness of l1is ski11

THE SCIENCE OF PALESTINIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
A SUPPLEMENT TO JEREMIAH
Flinders Petrie gave to Palestinian arcl1aeology its
metl1od; it remained for otl1ers to apply it. A strict rega1·d
for observing and recording layers or strata (stratigrapl1y)
and a careful study and analysis of the pottery (typology)
were first demonstrated to be of value by Petrie in i8go
and then beqt1eatl1ed to his successors.
One who learned 11is craft directly from Petrie 'vas
James Leslie Starkey, a Britisl1 archaeologist 'vho 11ad tl1e
good luck of making a truly great find. On Marcl1 i3, i935,
there was cabled from Palestine a news report an11ouncing
the remarkable discovery by Starkey at Tell ed-Du\veir of
a dozen letters written in g·ood biblical Hebrew. Tl1ey 'vere
written with iron-carbon ink on potsherds and 'vere dated
from the time of the propl1et Jeremiah.
This was news for several reasons. First, altl1ot1gh tl1ere
are many references in the Bible to people sending letters
from one place to anotl1er for example, the famous dis
patch of David to Joab, instructing 11im to dispose of
Uriah, Bathsheba's husband no such correspondence l1acl
ever turned up before in scores of excavations in Palestine.
Secondly, with tl1e exception of a Hebre'v insc1·iption ct1t
into the wall of the Siloam tunnel and some scattered os
traca, mostly containing proper names, tl1ere 'vas i11 ex
istence no ancient Hebre'v outside of tl1e Bible, a11d tl1e
Bible was kno,vn only from manuscripts 'vritte11 l1t1nd1·eds
of years after the events described. And tl1irdly, tl1e 11e,vly
announced file of correspondence came fi·o1n an exceeding
ly important and interesting period in the history of the
kingdom of Judah, the conquest of Judal1 by Nebucl1ad
nezzar, which resulted in the Exile.
For these reasons scholars in America and in Europe
anxiously awaited the publication of the unique docu
ments. By November, Professor Harry Torczyner of the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to whom the letters had
10



A SUPPLEMENT TO JEREMIAH
been committed for publication, had published photo
grapl1s of four the number by this time had increased to
eig·I1teen in a twenty-page article written in modern
Hebre\v.
\Vitl1 the opportunity to see a sample of this important
collection so soon after its discovery, orientalists in various
parts of the \vorld took tip the study and offered proposals
for tl1e reading of this correspondence.
Within three years after it had come from the ground
tl1e entire material \Vas made available in a sumptuous
pt1blication including photographs, drawings, commen
tary, and Torczyner's translation. This publication pro
dt1ced a flood of sug·gestions as to readings and meanings.
A recent bibliography of serious articles on the Lachish let
ters not inclt1ding news reports lists, for the years from
1938 to 1940, thirty-nine serious \Vorks on the subject,
\Vritten in ten different languages. Rarely have so few
\Vords been studied so intently by so many in so short a
•
time.
Starkey \Vas forty years old when he made the discovery.
It \Vas l1is tl1ird year as director of the Wellcome Archae
ological Researcl1 Expedition to the Near East. Like Petrie,
l1e l1ad not l1ad a rigid, formal education. At tl1e age of fif
teen he had left scl1ool and started to \Vork for an antiquity
dealer in London, making use of the reading room of the
Britisl1 Museum in his spare time to follow his natural bent
for the study of antiquity.
\Vith the coming of the First World War he went into
the Royal Naval Air Service and was fortunate in his as
signment to a lighthouse on the English coast, where he was
able to spend much of his time reading textbooks which he
had sent out to him. Upon demobilization he enrolled for
evening classes at University College in London, where
he met Petrie and studied Egyptian hieroglyphs.
In 1922 he abandoned a promising business career for

Yaosl1," wl1ile anotl1er opens with tl1e statement, ''Thy
servant Hosl1aial1 l1atl1 sent to inform my lo1·d Yaosl1." Fre
quently, the formal and to us stilted tl1ird person singu
lar is used; the sender refe1·s to 11imself usually as ''tl1y
servant," and to his correspondent as ''my lord."
Under the milita1·y emergency 'vl1icl1 the letters obvious
ly reflect, one migl1t suppose tl1at tl1e niceties of polite ad
dress would be neglected. Ilut tl1ey are not. F1·equently
there is the complimentary opening, ''May Yah,vel1 cause
my lord to hear tidings of peace." Tl1e sender of tl1e lette1·
goes a step farther tl1an our nineteenth-century ''your
obedient servant," and uses on several occasions the pl1rase,
''who is thy servant but a dog," an expression of polite ad
dress on the part of a subordinate to a superior in the Ilible
as well (II Samuel g:8, for example). Another convention
al phrase is tl1e empl1atic ''as Yal1wel1 thy God livetl1," an
oath wl1ich is also a part of biblical speecl1.
The more specific content of tl1e letters is difficult to
grasp because of tl1e loss of tl1e correspo11dence 'vl1icl1
passed in the other direction, f1·om Yaosl1 to Hosl1aial1, as

not called a scribe to read for him. In addition to the para
grapl1 of objection to tl1is cl1arge, he adds a report of mili
tary intelligence and a note about a letter which may have
contained some political information. The text of the
letter follows:
Thy servant Hoshaiah hath sent to inform my lord
Yaosh: May Yahweh cause my lord to hear tidings of
peace! And no\v tl1ou hast sent a letter, but my lord did
not enlighten thy servant concerning the letter which
thou didst send to thy servant yesterday evening, though
the heart of thy servant hath been sick since thou didst
'vrite to thy servant. And as for \vhat my lord said, ''Dost
thou not understand? call a scribe!'', as Yahweh liveth
no one l1atl1 ever undertaken to call a scribe for me; and
as for any scribe '"ho might have come to me, truly I did
not call him nor 'vould I give anything at all for him!
And it l1ath been reported to thy servant, saying, ''The
commander of tl1e host, Coniah son of Elnathan, hath
come do,vn in order to go into Egypt; and unto Hodavi
ah son of Ahijah and his men hath he sent to obtain ...
from him."
And as for the letter of Tobiah, servant of the king,
'vhich came to Shallum son of Jaddua through the
prophet, saying, ''Beware!'', thy servant hath sent it to
my lord.15
Important for the geographical information it gives, is
letter IV, beginning on one side of a broken piece of pot
tery and continuing on to the other side (Fig. 6). It de
scribes the breakdo,vn of a system of communication in the
area of the outpost held by Hoshaiah, who, with the failure
of the signals from the biblical city of Azekah, is entirely
dependent for vital information on the sig11als from Lach
ish.

rule of a single dynasty 'vl1icl1 11ad lasted more than fot1r
l1undred yea1·s. Yet tl1is dossier of a military commander
gives us, for tl1e crisis of 588-587 B.c., an insigl1t which is
lacking in tl1e official annalistic history of the period.
The Lacl1ish ostraca have indeed added a ne'v chapter
to the books of Kings and Jeremial1. It is a miracle that
this revealing, and at tl1e same time tantalizing, literature
has been preserved for over t\venty-five ht1ndred years in
the soil of Palestine. Recently, less than twenty years after
the recovery, a scl1olar who examined these letters in a
museum case, where tl1e envelopes of dirt and sand 'vl1icl1

of a pictu1-e of Sennacl1e1-ib taking Lacl1ish and 'vas fot1nd
in the elaborately-deco1-ated palace of Sennacherib. Almost
a hundred years later anotl1er British archaeologist, by
tracing the city 'valls at Tell ed-Du,veir, recovered from
the ground the plan of the city defenses; and this plan
seems to match in detail the representation of the defenses
made by Sennacherib's artists.
The famous campaign of Sennacherib to Syria and Pales
tine in 701 is described not 011ly in several books of the
Bible but in a \vell-preserved cuneiform inscription 'vrit
ten by the king's o'vn scribes. Fortunately, about one-third
of the long text deals '''ith the resistance and eventt1al sub
mission of Hezekiah, king of Judah (see p. 157 for the
text). The royal scribe goes into specific detail about tl1e
means employed by the Assyrians in taking tl1e ··,,,alled
forts'' of Judah. Tl1ey built 'vell-stamped eartl1-ramps for
the batteri11g-rams and g·ained e11t1-a11ce to tl1e city l)y
means of mines, breacl1es, and sapper '''ork.
Of all tl1e forty-six cities conqt1ered, Lacl1isl1 see1ns to
have been tl1e prize, tl1e sot1rce of Sen11acl1e1-ib's gi-eatest
pride upon 11is 1-eturn to l1is palace at Ni11e\'el1. '\\Titl1in 011e

throned on a 11ill before tl1e besieged city, 'vas a sl1ort
cuneiform inscription stating tl1at Sen11acl1erib sat on his

Here for the first time appeared an ancient illustration
of the taking of a biblical city, sl10,ving the clothing worn,
the city walls and other defenses, the Assyrian armory, the
methods of attack, and numerous details about daily life.

<)f t\\TO al te14 nate routes, since, in their opinion, the direct
1)ass of tl1e Art1na Road by Megiddo was too narrow for
tl1e rapid advance of the large army. The account of this
staff 1neeting has been preserved for us on the walls of the
temple at Karnak in Egypt:
T11ey said in the presence of his majesty: ''What is it
like to go on this road \vhich becomes so narrow? It is
repo14 ted tl1at the foe is there, waiting on the outside,
25

while they are becoming more numerous. Will not 11orse
have to go after 11orse, and the army and tl1e people
similarly? Will tl1e vang·uard of us be figl1ting 'vl1ile the
rear guard is waiti11g 11ere in Aruna, unable to fight?
Now two other roads are here. One of the roads be
hold, it is to tl1e east of us, so tl1at it comes out at Taan
ach. The other behold, it is to the north side of Djefti,
and we will come out to the nortl1 of Megiddo. Let our
victorious lord proceed on the one of them "\vhich is satis
factory to his heart, but do not make us go on tl1at diffi
cult road! 23
In reply to this counsel of caution, Thut-mose III de
cided to proceed daringly against his enemy in tl1e plain
beyond through the narrow defile leading to Megiddo. It
is reported in the Karnak inscription tl1at he declared:
I swear, as Re loves me, as my father Amon favors me,
as my nostrils are rejuvenated with life and satisfaction,
my majesty sl1all proceed upon this Aruna road! Let 11im
of you who "\visl1es go upon these roads of 'vl1icl1 you
speak, and let l1im of you 'vl10 'visl1es come in the follo,v
ing of my majesty! 24
As the Egyptian king took l1is place at tl1e l1ead of his
army three days later, l1e led 11is troops successfully over
the narrow pass into tl1e plai11 beyond. Tl1ere l1e i11et his
enemies, 'vho, only by abandoning their equiprnent, es
caped and found protection 'vitl1in tl1e g·reat 'valled city of
Megiddo. The account of tl1e battle of Megiddo and of tl1e
flight of tl1e enemy was inscribed tl1us:
Thereupon his majesty prevailed over them at tl1e head
of his army. Then they saw his majesty prevailing over
them, and they fled headlong to Megiddo with faces of
fear. They abandoned their horses and their chariots of
gold and silver, so that someone might draw them up
into this town by hoisting on their garments. Now the

people l1ad shut this toivn against them, but they let
do1vn garments to hoist them up into this town. Now,
if only 11is majesty's army had not given up their hearts
to capturing tl1e possessions of the enemy, they would
I1ave capt11red Megiddo at this time, while the wretched
enen1y of Kadesl1 and tl1e ivretched enemy of this town
1vere being dragged up 11astily to get them into their
to,v11, for the fear of his majesty entered their bodies,
tl1eir arms ivere 'veak, for his serpent-diadem had over
po1vered them." 25
Tl1e siege of tl1e ivell-fortified city of Megiddo lasted for
seve11 mo11tl1s, after ivl1icl1 it surrendered to Thut-mose III .
.\n i11ventory of the loot \vhich fell to the Egyptians when
tl1e city finally succ11mbed, along with the length of time
required to bring it into submission, is a measure of its im
portance:
List of the booty 1vhich his majesty's army carried off
from the toivn of Megiddo: 340 living prisoners and 83
l1ands; 2,041 horses, 191 foals, 6 stallions, and ... colts;
l cl1ariot 1vorked \Vith gold, with a body of gold, belong
ing to that enemy l fine chariot worked with gold be
longing to the Prince of Megiddo ... , and 892 chariots
of his \Vretcl1ed army total: 924; l fine bronze coat of
mail belonging to that enemy, l fine bronze coat of mail
belonging to the Prince of Megiddo, and 200 leather
coats of mail belonging to his wretched army; 502 bows;
and 7 poles of meru-wood, worked with silver, of the
tent of that enemy.26
Tl1ut-mose Ill's account of this strategic victory at Me
giddo is one of the earliest military histories which has
been preserved.
In the year 609 B.c. another Egyptian Pharaoh went up
to Megiddo and there slew Josiah, the king of Judah. Of this
event there is but the briefest report in the Bible: ''In his

pass and tl1e marcl1 into Nazareth, 'vl1ere the enemy's su
preme commander i11 Palestine, Liman von Sanders, was
surprised and ro11ted. It is tl1e entry for September 20, 1918:

clad only in pyjamas and armed 'vith an electric torch,
from his sleeping quarters to near Our Lady's Well shout

In May of 1925, with the acco11nts of these tl1ree impor

of tl1e first from hieroglyphs into English years before·
J ames Henry Breasted, the director of the Oriental In

arcl1aeological secrets layer by layer. Rockefeller agreed to
finance the excavation for a five-year period, and by tl1e end
of tl1e s11mmer Clarence S. Fisher, tl1e director of the new
11ndertaking, had started to build an expedition house
11ear the ancient site.

The components of a successful archaeological expedi
tion are many not the least of which is tl1e vision of tl1ose
\vho do tl1e planning. Certainly, Breasted's contributio11
of entl1usiasm was as essential a part of tl1e exca,ration as
tl1at taken by any wl10 actually dug tl1ere in tl1e long period
from 1926 to 1939·
While seeking to find s11pport for tl1e \Vork of tl1e Orien
tal Institute, Breasted had \v1-itten to a11 old friend, F. T.
Gates, asking for his help. Gates replied that he could see
no valuable light for contemporary civilization with its
needs in the middle 192o's lying under Eastern soil. His
refusal was frank: ''Megiddo and all its neighbors are curi
ous, but no longer vital. Civilization can save them up like
other choice dainties of its luxurious table, for times of
leisure." 29
To this refusal Breasted countered in a propl1etic tone:
''Coming generations will hold ours responsible if \Ve fail
to save from destruction the vast body of records \vl1icl1
\Ve have inherited from the Ancient Near East, many of
\vhich have come down and almost reached our eag·er fi11
gers, only to be snatcl1ed away and to perish at tl1e l1a11ds
of modern vandalism." 30 It \Vas tl1is necessary ing1-edie11t
of urgency wl1icl1 made possible the gaining of fi11ancial
support for tl1is most extensive of all Palestinian excava
•
t1ons.
In most excavations \vl1icl1 had been made 11p t1ntil tl1e
beginning at Megiddo, tl1e excavator had been content to
dig trencl1es or to cut a\vay part of tl1e ancient mot1nd of
accumulated debris. Tl1e Meg·iddo Expedition planned to
demolish layer by layer tl1e entire tl1irteen acres of tl1e
mound, laying bare each city for thorough study before
proceeding to its predecessor lying immediately below it.
Tl1is aim called for a long-range program. Clarence
Fisl1er began by building a large expedition l1ouse the
most completely equipped yet known in Palestine. Living

Moreover, the identification of tl1e modern city \vitl1 tl1e
ancient has never been lost.
But this continuous identification \vitl1 its past 11as
robbed tl1e arcl1aeologist, in our day at least, of the cl1ancc
of learning its secrets. Building·s sacred to tl1ree majo1
faiths and tl1e busy life of thousands of people cro,vdecl
into tl1e present walled to,vn 11ave made it impossible to
dig in the most important areas. Furtl1ermore, those areas
whicl1 do offer themselves for excavation have proved si11
gularly unproductive of both information and treasure,
partly because of the bungling of piecemeal digging and
partly because of the almost continuous occupation of tl1e
site by eager settlers who have moved in quickly after eacl1
destruction and rebuilt the city.
Despite the difficulties of getting at tl1e remai11s of a11
cient Jerusalem, British, Germa11, and French arcl1aeol
ogists have, for almost a century, persistently soug·I1t to
locate its ancient walls and building·s. Army officers fro111
England \Vere the first to dig. A pl1ilanthropic Englisl1
lady, Miss Burdett Cot1tts, \Vitl1 a desire to improve tl1e
sanitary conditions of tl1e Old City, fi11anced a ''st11-vey''
which developed into tl1e first ''a1-cl1aeolog·ical'' e11te1-prise
in 1864. By means of shafts and ttinnels Captain Cl1a1-Jes
Warren mined tl1rough masses of debris to get at tl1e fot111
dations of tl1e early city '''alls. It \Vas eve11tt1ally dete1-1ni11ecl
tl1at tl1e ancient city of David lay to tl1e sot1tl1east of tl1e

to fall into a stream of \Vater. In tl1e montl1 of June 1880,

(Fig. 15). A text, a little la1-g·er tl1an tl1e pag·e of a modern

a nt1mber of scholars.
Tl1e first part of tl1e inscriptio11 seems to be missi11g,
but 'vl1at is left is intelligible:
... 'vl1en tl1e tunnel \Vas driven tl1rough. And this was

\Vl10 could l1ave been responsible for tl1is public works

bee11 celebrated by a commemorative inscription? In the
Book of Kings there is a sl1ort summary of the \Vorks and
deeds of Hezekiah, king of Judah during tl1e perilous days
of tl1e siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib. Tersely it con
cludes: ''No'v the rest of tl1e acts of Hezekiah, and all his
migl1t, and ho'v he made the pool, and tl1e conduit, and
brought 'vater into the city, are they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Judal1?''36 And even
more explicit is the reference in Chronicles to Hezekiah's
provision for Jerusalem's \vater supply in time of siege:
''This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the
\vaters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the
\vest side of the city of David."31

logical expeditions ever undertaken in the Holy Land,
where, as it has been said by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, ''more
sins have probably been committed in the name of arcl1ae

surface." 38
For twenty years after it had }Jeen robbed of its com

had been, half silted up and "\Vitl1 many of tl1e re\1ealing

books, tl1is discovery of. ancient manuscripts became, in a
ve1·y sl1ort time, more widely known than any single
1·esult of Palestinian arcl1aeology in the sixty-five years
si11ce Petrie \vent to Tell el-Hesi in 1890 to begin the first
scie11tific excavation.
Tl1e sc1·0Ils became a sensation for several reasons. The
soil of Palestine had yielded indestructible materials from
biblical times, such as pottery, stone, metal, and ivory, b11t
no leatl1er or parchment. Even though perishable writ
ing materials I1ad survived in the dry climate of Egypt for
tl1011sands of years, before the finding of the Dead Sea
Scrolls no sober scholar \vould have dreamed of finding
i11 Palestine, \vhere the \Vinters are wet, ancient \Vritings
on leatl1er \Vl1ich had lasted through many centuries.
Tl1at among the surviving scrolls should have been manu
scripts and fragments of biblical books, copies which are
older by a thousand years than the Hebrew manuscripts
tl1at \vere kno\vn and used in making translations into
modern languages, \Vas another cause for amazement. These
ne'v discoveries sho11ld enable one to by-pass the errors
<111cl cl1a11g·es of copyists a11d bring the moclern reader
closer to \vl1at tl1e orig·inal ancient \vriter had said. So re
cently as a decade before the first discovery of the scrolls, Sir
F1·ederic Kenyon, an authority on biblical manuscripts,
l1ad gi,ren ttp hope of finding any copies of the Bible as old
as those discovered in 1947. He had \Vritten: ''There is,
indeed, no probability that we shall ever find manuscripts
of the Hebrew text going back to a period before the for
mation of the text \vhich we kno\v as Massoretic."39 But
tl1e improbable had come to pass.
The first discovery of scrolls was ironical, in that, like
tl1e discovery of the Siloam inscription, it was made by a
native boy, and not by any one of the hundreds of scientific
explorers and excavators. In the spring of 1947, so the
story can be pieced together from somewhat conflicting

... alo11g \Vitl1 t\vo eartl1enware vessels in which the Beduin
said tl1e scrolls had been stored."42 Later he added to his
collection. This material contained a part of a manuscript
of the Book of Isaiah; a scroll of ''The War of the Sons
of Ligl1t witl1 tl1e Sons of Darkness," more than nine
feet long \vl1en unrolled; and a collection of ''Thanksgiving
Psalms."
Tl1e material from the first discovery of scrolls has now
bee11 published and the non-biblical texts are available

IJy a series of important new discoveries. To be sure, no
large manuscripts have come to light, but 11undreds of
portions and fragments of scrolls have come from the gen

Not until almost t\vo years after the first manuscripts

l1ave tl1e opportunity to excavate carefully. Tl1e result of

Frag1ne11ts of manuscripts by the hundreds continued
to pot1r into tl1e Palestine Archaeological Muse um in J eru
salem. Ily Jant1ary 1956 ten other manuscript-bearing
caves 11ad bee11 discovered in the same area, 'vhich had no'v
come to be kno,vn as Qt1mran. The lion's share of the dis
covery 'vas 1nade by Bedouin Arabs who looted the caves for
tl1is ne'v type of ''treast1re'' and sold it to the archaeologists;
tl1e latter, too, dt1g the caves and salvaged the less con
spict1ot1s evide11ce. From Cave 4, tl1e most prolific, there
have been identified b-agments of about 330 doct1ments,
'vhicl1 no'v fill 420 plates of glass, bet,veen 'vhich the
frag111ents ai-e n1ounted (Fig·. 17).
vVl1en Pe1-c Roland de Vaux and G. Lankester Harding
excavated tl1e first cave in 1949, tl1eir attention had been
dra,vn to an ancient rt1in, Kl1irbet Qt1mran, on a high ter
race overlooking the Dead Sea at a point about a quarter
of a mile to tl1e sot1th of tl1e cave (Fig. 18). In 1851, F. de
Sat1lcy l1ad paid it a visit and st1ggested the famed Gomor
ral1 as its icle11tification. Witl1 more caution, others had
labeled it as a Roman fort. On their way from the cave in
1949, Harding and de Vaux stopped long enough to make
st1rface explorations and to open t'vo tombs, b11t found
notl1ing 'vhich indicated a connection with either the
mant1scripts or the cave in 'vhich they had been found.
It is difficult to imagine a less likely place for human
l1abitation than Khirbet Qumran. Shut in between the
steep cliff of tl1e J t1daean mountains to the 'vest and the
lifeless Dead Sea to the east, it lies in a barren 'vaste
scorcl1ed by the sun and devoid of vegetation most of the
year.
Not satisfied 'vith tl1e hurried examination of two years
before, de Vaux and Harding returned to dig Khirbet
Qumran in 1951 and remained at the task for five seasons.
To their surprise, the ruins we1-e not a Roman fort, nor,
in fact, an ordinary Palestinian town with city walls, streets,
and ho11ses, but an utterly unique structure. Covering an

Fie. 20. Sites i11 Palestine, from Sidon in the north to Petra in the
so11th, 'vhe1·e excavations have been made.
In tl1e cot1rse of a mere ten years there has emerged a
pictt1re of tl1e life of a community of Jewish sectarians of
tl1e centt1ries before and after Christ, a picture gen
erously documented by contemporary writings and by
tl1e actt1al remains of tl1e community. The significance of
tl1is discovery--despite tl1e bitter debates among scholars
and the exaggerated claims and counterclaims which have
been made in over-popularized accounts lies in the light
\vl1ich it has already shed, even at this early stage in the
study of the material, on the history of both Judaism and
Christianity. And Qumran and its caves have provided us
\Vith the oldest copies of the Hebrew text of the Bible.

been uncovered and publisl1ed by the scores of excavators
in Palesti11e. On a recent map of this land, approximately
the size of tl1e State of Vermont or the Island of Sicily, can
be counted ninety-nine ancient sites \vhicl1 l1ave been sub
jected to excavation (Fig. 20). Of this number, t\venty-five
have been worked sufficiently to justify tl1e labeling of them
as major excavations. This is indeed an impressive achieve
ment in the attempt to recover the land of tl1e Bible.

THE MAKING OF A MAP
PILGR I !\IS AND SOLDIERS
A·1· ·1·HE BEGINNING of tl1e ni11eteenth century, no area of
tl1e ea1·tl1's s11rface comparable in size to Palestine could
claim to l1ave received as m11cl1 attention from the outside
as tl1e Holy Land. Pilgrims by tl1e l111ndreds had written
stories of adventures on tl1eir visits to its holy places. Many
had dra,vn maps of their jo11rneys, indicating the routes
tl1at tl1ey had taken to tl1e sl11·ines, and had filled in details
of rivers, mountains, cities, and tribes, as they supposed
tl1em to have been from their reading of t11e Bible and the
'v1·itings of Josepl1us, Eusebius, and Jerome.
An industrio11s bibliog1·apher named Reinhold Rol1richt
l1as listed i,561 pt1blisl1ed 'vorks of travels and pilgrimages
made to Palestine before A.D. i 800, and more tl1an three
!111ndred maps of t11e 'vl1ole or parts of the land dra,vn
f1·om the fourth throug·h the eighteentl1 centuries.1
That Palestine '''as mapped so frequently throughout
fifteen centuries is not strange. It 'vas the ter1·a sancta for
tl1e e11tire 'vestern 'vorld, and a pilgrimage provided the
occasion for botl1 an act of devotion and an adventure. But
piety and curiosity were not tl1e only reasons for the contin
t1ed geographical interest. Palestine was not only the holy
la11d; it was believed to be the exact center of the earth!
Jerome, the great biblical scholar of the fourth century,
noted that the prophet Ezekiel had spoken of the land of
Israel as ''the navel of the earth'' (38: 12, Greek version)
and of Jerusalem as having the countries ''round about
lier'' (s:5).2 Relying upon the infallible authority of the

THE MAKING OF A MAP
Scriptures, mapmakers showed the world as circular 'vith
Jerusalem at its very center. The maker of tl1e tl1irteenth
century map of the world in the Hereford Cathedral ex
pressed this orthodox view of world geography in a dec
orated map of the round world (Fig. 21 ), and Dante put
the hint derived from Ezekiel in the thirty-fourth canto
of the Inferno.
Yet, with all tl1e map-making of fifteen centuries, Pales
tinian geography at the beginning of the nineteenth cen
tury relied principally on theology, pious legend, and guess
work. Travelers 11ad follo,ved 'vell-'\'Orn paths and had
had no means for cl1ecking directions or for measuring ac
curately the distances or angles. Tl1ey had been content
to accept uncritically traditions 'vhicl1 guides and custodi
ans of the shrines 'vere eager to pass on to them. Ancient
sites were indicated on their maps 'vitl1out references to the
names of the modern places and the landmarks of tl1e pl1ys
ical geography.
If one takes the latest and most detailed map of Palestine,
that of the Cadastral Survey made in tl1e i 93o's, and looks
for familiar biblical place-names, l1e ,,,ill find st1ch to'''ns
as Acre, Beersl1eba, Betl1lehem, Gaza, Hebron, Je1-icl10,
Jerusalem, Nazaretl1, and Tiberius. Yet, on tl1e p1-ese11t
day map of tl1is land, so rich '''itl1 l1istory, he '''ill 11ot fi11d
Samaria, Betl1el, Lacl1isl1, A11atl1otl1, Gibeal1, l\f eg·iddo,
Betl1-sl1an, or tl1e more than six l1und1-ed other na1nes '''l1icl1
figure in the biblical l1istory of the land '''est of tl1e J orda11
bet\veen Dan and Beersl1eba. Tl1e ancient names except
for the few more important to,vns have either been lost
sight of or obscured by the modern inhabitants of the land.
The gradual recovery in tl1e last century and a 11alf of
the lost map of ancient Palestine has involved t'vo tl1ings:
an accurate survey of tl1e land its villages, ruins, moun
tains, valleys, and springs and the finding of a sure method
of identifying these observable features with tl1e names
which appear in the ancient biblical and extra-biblical
sources.

THE MAKING OF A MAP
Neither relig·ious devotio11 nor a crusade occasioned the
first large-scale, modern 1nap of tl1e Holy Land. Tl1is map,
printed on five large sl1eets, \Vas the by-product of Napoleon
Bonaparte's campaign tl1roug·l1 Palestine in 1799, by 'vl1icl1
he sought to protect l1is troops in Egypt from attack by tl1e
Turkish army in Syria. Wl1en Napoleon arrived in Alex
andria, Egypt, on July 1, 1798, 'vitl1 an expeditionary fo1-ce
of 32,000 men, 11e 'vas accompanied by a corps of geograpl1
ical eng·ineers, 11eaded by M. T estevuide. Tl1e cl1ief geog
rapher was, however, soon assassinated during an insur
rection in Cairo. He was replaced by his nepl1e\v, Pierre
Jacotin, on wl1om there fell the responsibility for mapping
the four-month campaig·n of 1799 in Palestine and Syria.
During this short and 11azardous expedition Jacotin ac
companied the army and succeeded in surveying no less
than a total of 426 places along the route and placing tl1em
on five large maps, which were p11blished a fe\v years later
in Paris.3
Map-making during a 11asty military campaign \Vas 110
easy task. At times, one of the eng·ineers wrote later, they
were obliged to substitute \veapons for surveying instru
ments and to fight for a11d conquer tl1e terrain 'vl1icl1 they
were to measure. Tl1ere \Vas not only the incessant danger
of famine and disease but tl1e possibility of falling into tl1e
hands of hostile Arabs. Not infrequently tl1e surveyo1-s
had to take points of latitude and longitude \vl1ich l1ad been
determined by earlier explorers. Areas wl1ich could not be
reached by the geograpl1ers because of enemy occ11pation
had to be supplied from older ma1)s, or filled in from mili
tary reports of smaller expeditions, like the one 'vl1icl1 'vas
sent to Tyre.
Jacotin's maps, covering a good part of the area from
Gaza in the south to Sidon in the north, are indeed a re
markable achievement, especially when consideration is

The expedition began on Monday, Marcl1 12, 1838, 'vhen
the t'vo Americans left Cairo for a month's journey throt1gh
.Sinai to Palestine. Their eqt1ipment inclt1ded a large tent,
t,1·0 old mt1skets, a pair of pistols, the best maps available
at tl1e time, tl1e Bible in English, Greek, and Hebre,v, and
fi,·e of tl1e most important books on travels in Palestine.
Tl1e only instruments 'vere an ordinary surveyor's and
t'vo pocket compasses, a thermometer, telescopes, and
n1easttring tapes. The t'vo men kept separate jot1rnals, in
\1·!1icl1 each recorded his notes independent of the other.
Provisions consisted principally of rice and biscuits, coffee,
tea, st1gar, bt1tter, dried apricots ''quite a luxury in the
desert'' tobacco, for 'vinning the favor of Arabs, wax
candles, and a supply of charcoal. With some hired servants
and camels to pack the provisions, they set out for Sinai.
Nothing of interest escaped the notice of the travelers.
Tl1e temperature was usually recorded four times a day:

SURVEYING WESTERN PALESTINE
It may seem strange tl1at a land as small as Western Pal
estine, so frequently visited by pilgrims and travelers over
so many centuries, should have lacked an accurate map
produced by theodolite, chain, and compass until 1880. Of
the hundreds of maps which l1ad been made before tl1is
time, most 'vere based solely on route surveys, 'vl1ile tl1e
few more pretentious ones, sucl1 as Jacotin's five sl1eets,
'vere inadequately prepared in tl1e l1aste of coping 'vitl1

Vt1lgar tongt1e can compare 'vitl1 this \vork for the illustra

tl1e Old and Ne'v Testaments.
Tl1is sur\1ey, completed at a cost of about £18,000, \Vas
st1pported entirely by public subscription. The Palestine
Exploratio11 Fund had been organized in 1865 with the
po11clerot1s title, ''A Society for tl1e Accurate and Systematic
I11vestig·ation of the Archaeology, tl1e Topography, the
Geolog·y and Physical Geography, the Manners and Cus
toms of tl1e Holy Land for Biblical Illustration."13 At its
fi.1·st meeting the Archbisl1op of York had made it clear
tl1;1t all 'vork sl1011ld be carried out on scientific principles,
tl1at the body sho11ld abstain from controversy, and that
it sl1011ld not be cond11cted as a religious society. These
provisions ins11red a \vide base of support and a higl1 quali
ty of scientific results. Tl1e project of an accurate survey
of the land \Vas admirably s11ited to tl1e objectives of the
Fund.
The s11rvey 'vas commenced in January of 1872 by Cap
tain R. \V. Ste\vart, a royal engineer, and a staff of tl1ree as
sistants. Altho11gl1 Ste\vart 'vas almost immediately attacked
by fe\rer 'vhile measuring the first base line in Esdraelon,
the party 'vas able in a half year to survey accurately about
500 square miles.
In July of 1872 a little Russian steamer brought to the
port of Jaffa a t\venty-four-year-old engineer, Lieutenant
Claude Reignier Conder. He had come straigl1t from his

part of tl1e survey of 6,ooo square miles of Western Palestine
'vas made.
Tl1at a tl1orougl1going trigonometrical survey of Pal
estine 'vas not made earlier is readily understandable 'vhen
one reads tl1e accot1nt of Conder's 'vork in his t'vo volumes,
Tent Work in Palestine. Fever 'vas a constant enemy, tak
ing its toll in valuable time as one after another of tl1e
party fell ill; it finally claimed the life of tl1e survey's arcl1ae
ologist and linguist, C. F. Tyrv.rhitt Drake. Flies 'vere a
constant irritant: ''With almost every breath," complained
Conder, ··,ve sucked in 11alf a dozen of them; others were
just small enough to get up one's nose; some yet smaller
got into our eyes, and huge bluebottles bit tl1rough our
clothes."14 Then, on the occasion of a particularly heavy
siege of fever, Conder received letters from the Fund in
London complaining of the expense of tl1e st1rvey, ''the
last drop in the cup of my trouble."15
Diffict1lties 'vitl1 t1nfriendly tribes of Arabs reacl1ed a

Palestine Exploration Ft1nd later got £270 damages from
tl1e attackers.
It fell to tl1e lot of Liet1tenant Kitcl1ener (later Lord
Kitcl1e11e1·) to co1nplete tl1e final 1,300 sq t1are miles of
the st1rvey, and, as Co11der 'vrote later, to bring Palestine
l1ome to E11gland, "\vl1ere ''tl1e student may travel, in his
stt1dy, over its 'veary roads and rugged hills without an
acl1e, and may ford its dangerous streams, and pass through
its malariot1s plains 'vitl1ot1t discomfort."17 All of this actual
surveying 11ad been done in five years, at the cost of one
penny per acre, and a party of sixteen men and sixteen
animals had been maintained for an average cost of one
sl1illing and six pence a day per man and one shilling per
l1orse.
Tl1e editors of the great map of 1880 were not content
1nerely to list the modern names for sites. They proposed
identifications for places mentioned in the Bible and in
tl1e Apocrypha. Conder lists 622 ancient names and iden
tified '',vitl1 reasonable certainty'' more than t'vo-thirds,

cliscoveries dt1e to tl1e survey. Understandably, not all
tl1ese proposals l1ave stood, but the achievement is truly
rnon ti mental.
NEW SOURCES FOR AN ANCIENT MAP
Shortly after the completion of the great one-inch-to
011e-mile map by Conder a11cl Kitcl1ener, ne'v sources for the
<1ncient topography of Palestine began to appear. From
tl1e point of vie'v of those 'vl10 had lived in Palestine they
migl1t be called enemy sot1rces. Egypt for centuries had held
lier northern neig·I1bor as a part of her Asiatic empire;
later, Assyrian kings "\vere st1ccessful in annexing portions
of the land to their realm. The boastful records of Egyptian
and Assyrian kings, as tl1ey 'vere unearthed and under

stood, proved valuable for the geographer. Not only did
tl1ese enemy sources sttpplement the records of the Bible,
but they provided a control for interpreting tl1e latte1· doc
uments, many of "\vhicl1 !1ad been compiled fo~ theolog·ic;1l
and polemical purposes. Furtl1er, i11 the ne"\v texts scl1ol
ars had before them actt1al copies contemporary "\vith the
events they described.
Little did an Egyptian king, at about the nineteentl1
century B.C., s11spect that !1is practice of a kind of ''black
magic'' would supply scholars of the twentieth century A.D.
witl1 the names for a map of Palestine in this pre-biblical
period. But it did. Extremely valuable topographical in
formation was the gift of Egyptian superstition.
In 1926 there were publisl1ed texts from broken frag
ments of pottery bo"\vls "\vl1ich l1ad come into the posses
sion of the Berlin Museum. Tl1ese inscribed sherds had
been purchased at Thebes. Tl1e scholar "\vho p11blisl1ed
them realized that they had been inscribed "\Vith ''execra
tion texts."
The Egyptian practice of execration seems to have in
volved the "\vriting on bowls the names of enemies to be
cursed. With the smashing of the pottery the curse "\Vas be
lieved to become effective by sympathetic magic on the
enemies themselves. Sometimes the object of the c11rse "\Vas
stated in a blanket formula not unlike that of moder11
legal language as ''All men, all people, all folk, all males,
all eun11chs, all "\Vomen, and all officials, "\Vho may rebel,
who may plot, "\Vho may fight, "\vho may talk of fighting,
or who may talk of rebelling, and every rebel "\vl10 talks
of rebelling in this entire land."18
On other fragments specific foreign rulers and tl1eir
tribes and cities are mentioned. Shortly after the publica
tion of the execration bowls, there were found at Sakkaral1
in Egypt similar texts written not on bowls but on frag
ments of clay figurines (Fig. 24). These also had been

are mentioned Zebulon, and probably Moab, as \vell as
other unidentified Asiatic towns and peoples wl10 \Vere
enemies of the Egyptian kings of the nineteenth and eight·
eenth centuries B.C.
Not merely towns, tribes, and rebellious people within
Egypt itself \Vere the object of this execration, but more
indefinite forces which were felt to be a threat to peaceful
life: ''Every evil word, every evil speech, every evil slander,
every evil thought, every evil plot, every evil fig·l1t, eve1·y evil
quarrel, every evil pla11, every evil thing, all evil dreams,
and all evil slumber."19
A remnant of tl1is sa1ne practice of execration can pos
sibly be seen in a symbolic act whicl1 the propl1et .Jeremial1
performed at Jerusalem. Tl1e propl1et \Vas co1n1na11cled by
tl1e Lord to buy an eartl1en jar, 01· flask, a11d to b1·eak it

Tl1e fortt1nate discovery by an Egyptian \voman at Tell
el-;\ma1-11a, ir1 1887, (seep. 193) of the correspo11clence be
t,veen tl1e ki11gs Amen-l1otep III and Akh-en-Aton and the
g·o\'erno1-s of cities in Palestine and Syria has s11pplied the
best g·lim1Jse of life in Palestine before tl1e coming of tl1e
Hebre,vs lecl by Joshua. From the first part of the fifteentl1
cent11ry n.c. 've have tl1e bare lists of Palestinian cities
\vl1ich Tl111t-mose III carved in stone. Less than a l111ndred
years later many of the names in tl1is list come to life in
tl1e correspo11dence contained on the clay tablets found at
Tell el-Ama1-na. Unlike tl1e boastful inscriptions on the
monuments at K<1rnak, these letters were never intended
for p11lJlication. Reflected in them are intrig11e, jealo11sies,
fe11ds bet'''een local g·overnors of Palestinian to,vns, and
;1 'vealtl1 of detail abot1t politics, trade and comme1-ce, and
\1rarfare.
,\t typical chronicler of tl1c ag·e \vould have fo11nd these
\'i~;nettes of life in Palestine and Syria at the beginning of
tl1e fo11rteentl1 ce11t11ry disappointing. There are no lists
of cities, no dynasties of kings are listed. Ratl1er, tl1ey pre
sent a series of kaleidoscopic vie,vs of tl1e sit11ation of tl1e
mome11t in s11ch important places as Jer11salem, Gezer,
Megiddo, and Tyre. For tl1e historian tl1ese are more val11
able tl1an tl1c 'vork of tl1e official chronicler.
l\·fegiddo '''as an Egyptian city-state presided over by a
certain Biridiya, a prince \vho bore, as did many otl1er
princes of nothern Palestine of the time, an Inda-Aryan
11a1ne. l~iridiya 'vas threatened by Lab'ayu, tl1e ''lion-like,"
'''ho ''"as ag·gressively raiding his neighbors. Desperately, the
prince of lVIegiddo beseeches the king of Egypt for rein
f<lrcemen ts:
At tl1e t\VO feet of the king, my lord, and my Sun-god,
seven and seven times I fall. Let the king kno\v tl1at ever
since the archers returned [to Egypt?], Lab'ayu has ca1·
ried on hostilities against me, and \ve are not able to

in the presence of J,all'ayt1, since 11e learned tl1at tl1ot1
l1as not g·iven a1-cl1ers; and no'v 11is face is set to take
Megiddo, b11t let tl1e king protect 11is city, lest l,ab'ay11
seize it. Verily, tl1e city is destroyed by deatl1 f1-01n pesti
lence and disease. I.et the king g·ive one l1undred garri
son troops to gt1ard tl1e city lest Lab'ayu seize it. Verily,
tl1ere is no otl1er p11rpose in Lab'ayu. He seeks to destroy
Megiddo.24
In the same file of correspondence is a letter from this
Lab'ayu, protesting tl1at he had to fight. He had been the
innocent victim of aggression in the capture of his native
town:
''... I am slandered/blamed before the king, my lord."
Further, when even ants are smitten, they do not accept
it passively, bt1t tl1ey bite the hand of the man 'vl10 smites
them. How could I hesitate this day \vhen t\vo of my
towns are taken? Further, even if thou shot1ldst say: ''Fall
beneath tl1em, and let them smite thee," I sl1ot1ld still
repel my foe, and tl1e men 'vl10 seized tl1e to\vn and my
god, the despoilers of my father, yea I \VOt1ld repel
them. 25
In anotl1er letter tl1e ''lion-like'' Lab'ayu protests JJOS
sibly too mt1cl1 l1is innocence against ce1-tai11 s1)ecific
cl1arges ,vJ1icl1 tl1e I~g·y1Jtain king 11as made against l1i111. 1-Ie

of me? Bel1old, I am a faithful servant of tl1e king, and
I have not rebelled and I have not sinned, and I do not
withhold my tribute, and I do not refuse tl1e requests of
my commissioner. No'v they wickedly slander me, but

Sometime arot1nd I I oo B.C., soon after the Philistines
and tl1e Tjeker !1ad settled along tl1e Palestinian coast and
'vl1ile tl1e Israelites 'vere strt1g·gling to get a hold in the
l1ill cot1ntry, an Eg·yptian official named Wen-Amon visited
tl1e seaport of Dor, '''hicl1 lies jt1st a fe,v miles to the south
of l\1t. Carn1el. Tl1e adventt1re he had tl1ere is recounted on
a )Ja)Jy1·11s \vl1icl1 is no'v tl1e property of the Moscow Muse
11n1. Tl1e Dor episode in tl1e tale is but one incident among
1nany '\1l1icl1 \Ve11-Amon l1ad in the long journey that took
l1i1n f1·01n Tanis in the Delta to Dor, to Tyre, to Sidon, to
l~yblos, to Cyprt1s, and tl1en back to Egypt.
vVen-Amon had been sent by the priests of Tl1ebes to
fetcl1 \vood from tl1e Lebanon for building a barque for
the Eg-yptian god An1on-Re. At Tanis he 'vas sent by the
rt1ler of tl1e Delta in a sl1ip to\vard his destination at Byblos.
But at Dor, \Vl1icl1 belong·ed to the Tjeker, he \Vas robbed.
His account of dealings 'vhich he had with Beder, the
prince of Dor, is so full of personal detail that \Ve might
speak of it as tl1e earliest adventt1re story of a visit to the
I-Joly !,and.
I reached Doi·, a to,vn of the Tjeker, and Beder, its
p1·ince, 11ad 50 loaves of bread, one jug of wine, and one
leg of beef brougl1t to me. And a man of my sl1ip ran
a'vay and stole one vessel of gold, amounting to 5 deben,
four jars of silver, amounting to 20 deben, and a sack of
11 deben of silver. Total of \Vl1at he stole: 5 deben of
gold and 31 deben of silver.
I got up in tl1e morning, and I went to the place \vhere
tl1e P1·ince 'vas, and I said to him: ''I have been robbed
in yot1r l1arbor. N o'v you are the prince of this land,
and yot1 are its investigator who should look for my
silver. No,v abo11t this silver it belongs to Amon-Re....

And he said to me: ''Whether you are important or
wl1etl1er you are eminent look l1ere, I do not recognize
tl1is accusation \vl1icl1 you have made to me! Suppose
it had been a tl1ief \vl10 belonged to my land '''ho \vent
on your boat and stole yot1r silver, I shot1ld ha,,e repaid
it to you from my treasury, t1ntil tl1ey l1ad found tl1is
thief of yours wl1oever he may be. No'v about tl1e tl1ief
who robbed you he belongs to you! He belongs to your
ship! Spend a fe\v days here visiting me, so that I may
look for him."
I spent nine days moored in l1is harbor, and I \vent
to call on him, and I said to him: ''Look, you have not
found my silver. Just let me go \vith the ship captains
and with those who go to sea!'' But he said to me: ''Be
· I ••2s
quiet....
At this point the speecl1 of Beder breaks off abrt1ptly.
It is clear that Wen-Amon \vent to Tyre, and possibly called
at Sidon. When the text beg·ins again, \Ve see We11-Amon
in a tent on the seasl1ore at Byblos, \Vitl1 l1is god Amon-of
tl1e-Road and sil\1er \vl1icl1 11e l1ad seized from so1ne of tl1e
Tjeker \vl1om he had encountered.
And tl1e Prince of Byblos se11t to 1ne, sayi11g·: ''Get 011t
of my l1arbor!'' And I se11t to l1im, sayi11g: ''\Vl1e1·e sl1ot1lcl
I go to? ... If yot1 11ave a sl1i1) to car1·y 1ne, l1a\1e 1ne taken

bor, \vl1ile 11e spent tl1e time sending· to 1ne eve1·y day to
say: ''Get out of my l1arbor!'' 29
The change in tl1e fortunes of Wen-Amon at Byblos
came about because of tl1e prophetic activity 11ot 11nlike
that attributed to Sat1l \vhen l1e propl1esied before Sam
uel (I Samuel 19:24) of a court page, \vho revealed to
the Prince that the god Amon had truly sent Wen-Amon.
Now while he \vas making offering to his gods, the god
seized one of his yot1ths and made him possessed. And
he said to him: ''Bring up the god! Bring tl1e messenger

EXCAVATING FOR A MAP
Obvio11sly, tl1e 1nost reliable means for detern1inir1g the
location of a11cient sites on tl1e map is systematic excava
tion. Careful excavation sl1ould provide a profile of the
occ11pation l1istory of the ancient site, revealing the periods
of occ11pation, the gaps 'vl1en tl1e mot1nd 'vas deserted, and
e\•iclences for destr11ctions. In many cases this profile, 'vhen
set over against the history of an ancient to\vn, as it is kno'''n
from \Vritten so11rces, provides convincing proof for tl1e
site's identification.
In a fe''' cases, tl1e discoveries in the co11rse of excavation
l1a\1e Leen 1nore clecisive. After Robinson's visit in 1852
Lo Beisan in northern Palestine, he 'vas convinced, despite
a rather 11nt1s11al contraction in the modern name, that
tl1e place '''as to be identified as the ancient Beth-shan, to
\1•l1ose \Valls the bodies of Saul and his sons l1ad been fas
tened by tl1e Philistines. Slightly more than seventy years
later, tl1e American excavators found there an inscribed
stela of the Egyptian King Seti I. In the text the king tells
110\v he sent ''the first army of the Re, (named) 'Plentiful
of Valor,' to tl1e to,vn of Beth-shan."34 The finding of the
3·1 ANET, 253.

THE MAKING OF A MAP
name of Beth-shan in the mound at Beisan was one ft11-the1
proof that Robinson had been right in his guess.
The discovery of the 'vord ''Lachisl1'' in the text of tl1e
famous letter fot1nd at Tell ed-Du'''eir (see p. 16) strength
ened earlier guesses tl1at Lachish 'vas to be placed at tl1is
site on the modern map. Long before it '''as excavated
systematically, Gezer 'vas identified 'vith the modern Tell
J ezer, 'vhen Clermont-Ganneau discovered on the out
skirts of tl1e tell boundary stones inscribed 'vith tl1e name
of Gezer in Hebrew.
The fortunate discovery, in 1g56, of the ancient na1ne of
the modern site of el-Jib, just eight miles north of Jerusa
lem, is an example of ho'v excavation may terminate a
lengthy debate over an identification.
Franz Ferdinand von Troilo, a Silesia11 11oble1na11, 'v;1s
tl1e first modern traveler to record the st1g·g·estion tl1at tl1e
Arab village of el-.Jib '''as the location of t11e biblical Gibe
on. He visited tl1e villag·e in 1666. In t11e follo'''i11g ce11
tury, Ricl1ard Pococke, an Irisl1 bisl1op, ''isitecl tl1e Holy
Land and, looking do'''ll on el-Jib &-01n Nebi Satn'''il to tl1e
south, judged it to be ancient Gibeo11. Exactly a cent111-y
later, Ed,vard Robinson spent forty minutes in el-.Jib on
May 5, 18~8. From l1is carefttl st11dy of tl1e a11cie11t so111-ccs.
he conclt1ded tl1at ''it is not diffi.ct1lt to 1-ecog11ize i11 el-.Jil)
and its 1-ocky eminence tl1e ancient Gibeo11 of tl1e Sc1-i1J
tures."35
But Robinson 'vas not 11na,vare of a diffic11lty i11 tl1e
identification. There is a statement by Et1sebi11s. tl1e Bisl1o]J
of Caesarea, in I1is famot1s geog1-apl1ical '''01-k called tl1e
Onomasticon, tl1at the location of Gibeo11 is fo11r Ro
man miles 'vest of Betl1el. Since tl1e ''illage of el-Birel1, a
town well to the north of el-Jib, qualifies as bei11g abot1t
four Roman miles to the 'vest of Betl1el, Robinson took the
reference on the part of the fot1rth-century Bisl1op of Cae

(Gibeo11) 'vl1icl1 tl1e sot1nd of the modern ''.Jib'' st1gg·ested
to l1is ear.
·1-11e first i111portant voice to be raised against tl1e el-.Jib =
Gibeo11 equatio11 'vas tl1at of Albrecl1t Alt, 'vl10 pt1blished
a lear11ed article in 1926, by 'vhicl1 he sought to settle some
of tl1e p1·oblems of the ancient topography of tl1e area to
tl1e no1·tl1 of Jerusalem. Taking as trustworthy the note
g·iven i11 tl1e Onomasticon, Alt located Gibeon at Tell en
Nasbel1 a11d proposed that the biblical Beeroth 11ad been
located at el-.J ib. Other scholars of tl1e German school took
tip l1is vie'v and supported it. More than a quarter of a
centu1·y later, Alt publisl1ed so1ne ''Ne\v Considerations of
tl1e Location of Mizpal1, Ataroth, Beeroth and Gibeon."36
111 spite of tl1e objectio11s of other geographers, he held to
tl1e ide11tification of el-Jib with Beerotl1.
TI1e ans,ver to tl1e long-debated question of el-Jib's
a11cie11t name came sL1ddenly and unexpectedly in 1956.
·1-J1e fi1·st excavation of the site \Vas carried on under the
()irection of tl1e 'vriter for a brief period of ten \Veeks. In
tl1e cou1·se of clearing the debris from a large, rock-cut pool
just inside the city wall at the north of the mound, there
,,·ere found t'vo jar-l1andles and a portion of a third, in
S('.ribed 'vitl1 the name ''Gibeon'' in archaic Hebre\V script
(Fig. 31 ).
Wl1ile this discovery seemed to provide a satisfactory
a11s,ver to the question of identification, there was yet a
possibility that these three handles could have been brought
in ancient times from another city. Also, we were troubled
by the question as to \vhy the owner of a jar should have
inscribed it with the name of his town.
We returned in 1957 to dig for a second season at el-Jib.
Tl1is time there appeared in the debris of the pool twenty
four more handles inscribed with the name ''Gibeon'' and
the evidence that all of these handles had belonged to jars

BAAL AND THE RELIGION OF CANAAN
THE FRENCH IN PI-IOENICIA
Ti-IE age-old religion of Canaan, a land extending in a
11arro'v strip along the entire eastern coast of the Mediter
anean, 'vas kno,vn t1ntil about a century ago principally
fl-om the Old Testament. There, it is to be be seen through
tl1e eyes of zealot1sly hostile Hebrew prophets, who con
demned Canaanite religion 'vithout bothering to describe
this rival system of religious practice. With tl1e disappear
ance of tl1e Canaa11ites and their religion, there were left
011ly obsc111-e allt1sions to their g·ods and sacrifices, references
\\'l1icl1 had bee11 ft1ll of meaning for the prophet's hearers,
b11t 'vl1ich later readers found obscure.
Wl1ile tl1e pict11re of the religion of Canaan preserved
i11 tl1e Old Testament is vag11e, there are many references
to it. ''To g·o a 'vl1oring after'' other gods, is a phrase as
fra11k in its original Hebre'v as it is in tl1is older translation
into Elizabetl1a11 Englisl1; it is the 11sual 'vay of referring
to pa1-ticipation in tl1e rites for tl1e Canaanite god Baal.
t\long '\1itl1 Baal, other deities are occasionally mentioned:
the g·oddess Asl1toretl1, to 'vl1om tl1ere was a temple at
Betl1-shan, 'vl1ere tl1e armor of Saul 'vas placed after his
cleatl1; Cl1emosh, the god of the Transjo1-dan Moabites, for
\\1hom Solomon erected a high place; Malech, tl1e god to
'vl1om child sacrifice 'vas made; and Dagon, the Philistine
god of Ashdod. More frequently the pantheon of Canaan
is referred to merely by the anonymous ''other gods."
Vagt1e also is the picture of how tl1e Canaanites wor
sl1ipped. From scattered references in the Bible we can
piece together a picture of "\Vorship at high places, equip
ped \vith altars, standing pillars, and images of Asherah.

The field of Pl1oenician archaeology 11acl been particu

just five years before 11is departure, of the great sarcopha
g·t1s of Esl1mt1nazar, a fifth-century king of Sidon (Fig. 35).
This massive coffin of black basalt, meas11ring over 8 feet

t\venty-t,vo lines, mentioning among other gods three Ca
11aa11ite deities kno\vn from the Bible, Dagon, Baal, and

A study of tl1e Pl1oenician i11scriptions !1as 111ade it clea1·
tl1at the pantl1eo11 of Canaanite Palestine, as '''e kno'v it
from the Hebre'v Bible, belongs to tl1e same fa1nily of g·ods
kno\vn in tl1e cities of Ty1·e, Sidon, and Byblos, along tl1e
Phoenician coast. Many of tl1e texts are on to111bstones a11cl
contain the names of gods and goddesses to '''l1om tl1e
stones are dedicated. Asl1tart, or Asl1toreth as tl1e name a1J
pears in tl1e Bible, makes 11er appearance more tl1an fo1·ty
times in Phoenician and later Punic insc1·i]Jtio11s; and tl1e
name occurs even more frequently as an ele1nent in per
sonal names. The name Baal is commo11. Tl1e goddesses
Anath and Asherah also appear in Pl1oenician texts.
One of the earliest discoveries of a Pl1oenicia11 inscriptio11
was made at Marseilles, France, in 1845. Tl1e doct1ment,
'vritten possibly in the third or seco11d centt1ry n.c., and
perhaps at Carthage, lists the tariff of payments to be 111ade
to the priest by the worsl1iper for certain types of offe1·i11g·s.
As in Leviticus (7:32), tl1e part of tl1e victim to be ke]Jt l)y

The discovery of a mass of ne'v Ca11aa11ite lite1·att11·e i11
a hitherto unknown script produced in scl1olarly ci1·cles of
the 193o's a sensation not unlike tl1at made by tl1e finding
of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the late 194o's and 195o's. The
new literature 'vas a surprise on several counts. First, it
was from about the fourteentl1 century B.c., a period earli
er by several hundred years than any previo11sly kno'''n
Canaanite material; secondly, it was written in an alpha

ical and legendary in content and poetic in form. Up
t1ntil this time, no Canaanite mythology and no Canaanite
JJOetry had come to light.
In the discoveries at Ras Shamra the modern Arabic
name for lvhat \Vas anciently called U garit more light
,,·as tl1rolvn on the nature of Canaanite religion than had
come from the entire preceding century of excavation and
study. The impact of these finds from Ras Shamra was
qt1ickly felt in the circles of biblical research, particularly
in the fields of Hebre\v lexicograpl1y and poetry. Words
and allusions long pt1zzling \Vere cleared up by the nelv
texts, and tl1eories based on tl1e assumption that there \Vas
no lvritten poetry in the earliest periods of biblical history
l1ad to g·ive 'vay, or be modified, by this sudden appearance
of an extensive library of poetry from the land of Canaan.
Again, it '''as tl1e French lvho made the find of this im
JJOrta11t material Syria had become a Frencl1 protectorate
in 1920 and lVho had a large share in its decipl1erment
and interpretation.
One day in the spring of 1928, a Syrian peasant \Vas plo\v
ing 11is field lvhich stretched out along the edge of a small
l1arbor for fishing boats on the north Syrian coast, called
l\1inet el-Beida (''vVhite Port''). His plow struck a large
stone. lvhicl1 he proceeded to lift and found that it be
longed to a tomb. Investigating further, the peasant fot111d
that the tomb contained pottery and tl1at several of the
smaller vases \Vere intact. Word soon got to the Service des
Antiquites, from lvhich its director, Charles Virolleaud,
promptly sent an assistant to inspect the find. Thus it was
that a tomb so casually opened by a peasant led to the dis
covery of the cemetery, which in turn belonged to a low
lying mound less than a mile away, a tell which has turned
ot1t to lle the most important Canaanite site yet found.
When spring came the following year, Claude F. A.
Schaeffer, to \vhom the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles

Even a casual readi11g of tl1ese lines reveals a striking

i11 tl1e poetry of the Book of Psalms. A statement made in
tl1e first line of a couplet is repeated 'vith slightly different
11t1ance in tl1e second. Tl1is poetic device, shared by Ca
11aanite and Hebre'v poetry, 11as led many scl1olars to see a
clear case of borro,ving· on tl1e part of the Hebrew poets
from tl1eir alien neigl1bo1·s. In a fe,v cases the debt goes
beyond poetic form, as for example the following two
couplets in tl1e Psalms:
For, lo, Tl1i11e enerr1ies, 0 Lord,
For, lo, Tl1ine enemies shall pe1·ish;
All the '''orkers of iniquity shall be scattered.21
Thy kingdom is a kingdo1n for all ag·es,

Si1nilarly, tl1e poet of tl1e Baal Myth had \Vritten:

put picturesquely in a list of specific benefits one may
1·easonably expect from his son.
The passage appears in a poem of \vl1icl1 one of tl1e p1·i11

'vho sits before tl1e gate, ''judging the cause of tl1e 'viclo\v,

mentio11ed along \vitl1 Job and Noal1 ii1 tl1e Book of Ezek

A similar obligation on the part of tl1e son is reLognizecl

pent; and He \vill slay tl1e dragon tl1at is in the sea."27
In a Psalm, God is addressed: ''Thou didst shatter tl1e l1eads
of tl1e sea-monsters in tl1e \Vaters; Thou didst crusl1 tl1e
l1eads of leviathan." 28
This graphic imagery of the triumph of Israel's gocl
over sea-monsters, leviatl1an, serpents, and dragons had
its precursor in Canaanite lore preserved at Ugarit. In a
fragment of tl1e Baal myth, there is but the protasis of a
conditional sentence \vhicl1 shares \vith the Hebre\v poetry
certain rare \VOrds:
If thou smite Lothan [leviathan], the serpent slant,
Destroy the serpent tortuous,
Shalyat of the seven l1eads, ...29
The prohibition by Hebre\v prophet and la,vmaker
against tl1e making of idols suggests the prevalence of
idolatry in Canaan. From tl1is clue one \VOt1ld naturally
look for tl1e remains of Canaanite images in tl1e debris
of the dozens of ancient sites \vhich l1ave been excavated
in Palestine-Syria.
The most frequently recur1·ing ''likeness of anytl1ing
that is in heaven above, or tl1at is in the earth beneatl1,"
is the clay plaque of a nude female figure no larger tl1an
a man's hand (Fig. 43a). These terracottas are fa1· fi·on1 l)e
ing works of art. They are generally crude, but al'''ays e111
phasize, sometimes tl1rot1gl1 exagg·eration, tl1e disti11ctively
feminine aspects of the human figure.
The \videspread tise of tl1ese objects is attested both by
tl1e fact tl1at they \Vere son1etimes mass-p1·oduced throt1g·J1
the use of a clay mold and by tl1e great number of tl1e111
found in almost every major excavation of re1nains dati11g
from the eigl1teenth to tl1e sixth centuries B.c. Dtiring
World War II, I was able to catalogue 294 of these objects
which had been publisl1ed in excavation 1·eports; if access
could have been had at that time to the museums of the
Near East, the number could have been greatly increased.
21 Isa. 27: 1. 20 ANET, 138.

THE BIBLE FROM UGARIT
Just \vhat t1se these objects had remains a mystery to
tliis day. \ ·Vere they \vorshiped as a goddess? Were they
cl1arms to assist '\vomen in childbirth or as an aid to fertility?
Or ,\,ere they representations of the sacred harlots connected
,vith Canaanite shrines? As yet one cannot be certain. But
1nost opinion agrees that these objects served some vital
religiot1s or magical purpose in the practice of Canaanite
religion.
Fie. 43a. Nude female figu1·ine,
made in a double mold, found at !\1egiddo.

)
Fie. 43b. Canaanite god made of
lJ1·onze and covered with gold,
found at Megiddo.
The male figure, \vhich appears much less frequently, was
made of metal rather than of clay, and was always repre
sented clothed, and frequently portrayed in a seated pos
tt1re (Fig. 43b). One of the best examples of these molten
images comes from Megiddo. This small, ten-inch, gold...
covered, bronze figure of the period of the Hebrew Judges
may well represent a god, as he sits on his throne, wearing
a high, conical headdress, earrings, and a long robe. The
finding of this and other idols in Canaanite contexts of
Palestinian soil gives perspective to the aniconic passion of
the Hebrews in the midst of Canaanite idolatry.
123



BAAL AND THE RELIGION OF CANAAN
SEX, FERTILITY, AND RELIGION
At one point at least tl1e picture of Canaanite religion
in tl1e Old Testament and tl1e discoveries of tl1e past cen
tury converge: the cult of Canaan 'vas concerned 'vitl1
fertility in field, flock, and family.
Ugaritic mythology pictures tl1e g·ods as engaging in
most human activities: they sacrifice, eat, make 'var, kill,
build l1ouses, relax and ''t,viddle their fingers," ride on
beautiful jackasses. One text, of which only a fragment
is preserved, has a graphic account of sexual union bet,veen
Baal and Anath and seems to be follo,.ved by a description
of the resulting fertility of the l1erds: ''Calves tl1e co,vs
drop: an ox for the Maiden Anatl1 and a l1eifer for Yahamat
Liimmim."80
By a kind of sympathetic mag·ic tl1e 11nion of gods, res11lt
ing, as it 'vas believed, in tl1e fertility of flocks and fa1nily,
'vas effected, or at least stimulated, by similar actions among
humans in the temples of the gods. Evidence for this ritual
comes from a late, and possibly some,vl1at exag·gerated,
sot1rce in the 'vriting of the tl1e Greek Lucian of Samosata,
'vl10 lived in the second century A.D. Under tl1e tl1in ve11eer
of tl1e deities Apl1rodite and Adonis may be recog11ized tl1e
older Canaanite personag·es of Asl1to1·etl1 and Baal. Wrote
Lt1cian:
But I also saw in Byblos a great te111ple of A1Jl11-odite of
Byblos, in 'vl1icl1 also tl1e rites of Adonis a1·e 1Je1-fo1-med.
I also made incit1iry concer11ing tl1e 1·ites; for they tell
tl1e deed 'vl1icl1 is done to Adonis by a boar in tl1eir O\Vn
country, and in 1nemo1-y of l1is st1ffering tl1ey beat tl1eir
lJreasts eacl1 year, and wail, and celebrate tl1ese rites,
and institute great lamentation tl1ro11ghout tl1e country.
But wl1en tl1ey have bewailed and lamented, first they
perform £11neral rites to Adonis as if he were dead, b11t
afterward upon another day they say he lives, and they
so ANET, 142.

cast dust into the air and sl1ave tl1eir heacls as tl1e Eg·yp
tians do \vl1en Apis dies. But women such as do not \vish
to be sl1aven pay tl1e follo\.ving penalty: 011 a certain
day tl1ey stand for prostitution at the proper tin1e; and
tl1e market is open to strangers only, and tl1e pay goes as
a sacrifice to Aphrodite.31
Tl1e practice of sacred prostitt1tion is probably tl1e oc
casion for the invective of tl1e propl1et Hosea of tl1e eighth
ce11tury, \vl10 cried ot1t: ''Tl1ey sacrifice upon the tops of the
nio11ntains, and offer upon tl1e 11ills, under oaks and poplars
a11d terebinths, becat1se the sl1adow tl1ereof is good; there
fore yot1r daug·hters commit harlotry, and your daugh
ters-in-la\v commit adultery ... and they sacrifice with
liarlots. "32
A century later, the autl1or of Deuteronomy, confronted
\Vitl1 tl1e age-old practice of sacred prostitution, wrote
into this document of Israel's religious code a prohibition.
1)11t in place of mentioning ot1trigl1t the sodomite, or the
1nale p1·ostitt1te, he injected the opprobrious title of ''dog''
instead.
Tl1ere sl1all be no harlot of tl1e dat1gl1ters of Israel,
neitl1er sl1all tl1ere be a soclomite of the so11s of Is1·ael.
Tl10L1 shalt not bring tl1e l1ire of a harlot, or tl1e price
of a dog, into the house of tl1e Lord thy God for any vo,v;
for even both these are an abomination unto tl1e Lord
tl1y God. 33
\Vl1ile tl1e picture of Canaanite religion from tl1e li te1·a
ture and tl1e monuments is admittedly sketchy, especially
\Vl1en contrasted with what is known of the neigl1boring
relig·ions of Egypt and Babylonia, certain facts 11ave been
establisl1ed '\.vith a high degree of probability by tl1e past

ASSYRIA, ISRAEL'S ENEMY
LEARNING TO READ CUNEIFORM
IN THE ANNALS OF ARCHAEOLOGY tl1e recovery of ancient
1\ssyria stands ot1t as a ttnique triumph. At the middle of the
nineteentl1 centt1ry, t'vo men, excavating along the upper
Tigris River, discovered palace after palace of tl1e Assyrian
kings, ricl1ly documented 'vith ct1neifor1n inscriptions on
rl1eir 'valls. At about the same time, tl1e painstaking labors
of t'vo gene1·ations of scholars in clecipl1ering ct1neiform
'''ere cro,vned 'vitl1 st1ccess, so that tl1e spectact1lar monu
ments from tl1e Assyrian palaces could be placed almost
i1n111ediately in tl1e frame,vork of 'vritten Assy1·ia11 l1istory.
Tl1is acl1ievement of discovery and decipl1erment pro
\'ided a 'vealth of 11e'v material for t1nderstancli11g tl1e l1is
tory recorded in tl1e Bible. Assyria and Israel had been in
contact for centt1ries. Since to the biblical record of in
ternational relations could no'v be added the Assyrian
side of tl1e story, the 11istory of ancient Israel no longer
stood in tl1e isolation of ''sacred history." Thus it is fair
to say that at tl1e middle of the ninetee11tl1 century Israel
l1ad entered into the main stream of world history.
Before the discoveries of tl1e 184o's and 185o's, Assyria
appeared only as a long and menacing sl1adow casting it
self over the pages of t'vo centuries of biblical 11istory.
Generally it bears the vag·ue label of ''tl1e King of Assyria,"
but in a fe\v places the names of particular kings appear,
as Tiglath-pileser, Shalmaneser, Sargon, Sennacherib, and
Esarl1addon. The Prophet Isaiah, witl1 cl1aracteristically
vivid speech, described the approach of the l(ing of Assyria

and \Vritings dependent ttpon it. Then from the earth of
tl1e region of the tipper Tigris River there emerged records
of tl1e Assyrian kings me11tioning Omri, Al1ab, Jehtt, Mena

Israelite and Jt1daean enemies and subjects mentioned by
11ame, bttt specific details of geography, dates, and amounts
of tribute received \Vere recorded in cuneiform.
Tl1is ne\v perspective for biblical studies was achieved
largely by four men of \videly-differing backgrounds and
interests. Henry C. Ra\vlinson was an English soldier, hav
ing seen service in India and Persia, and a student of ori
ental languages. Paul Botta, before distinguishing 11imself
as an archaeologist, had been a ship's doctor on a voyage to
California, a physician to Muhammad Ali in Egypt, and a
constilar official of France in Alexandria, Jerusalem, and
T1·ipoli. Henry Layard's background for archaeology in
clt1ded 'vork in a London la'v office, travels, and the British
diplomatic service in a semi-official capacity. Among the
fot11·, only Ed,vard Hincks, an Irishman, belonged to the
clergy, the profession \vl1icl1 for centuries had contributed
1nost to biblical researcl1. Tl1ese 'vere the men who set in
1notion the discipline of Assyriologyr as related to tl1e Bible.
"fl1e records of ancient Assyria \Vere written in a script
and a langtiage, tl1e meanings of 'vhich had long since
been forgotten. Decipherment and translation reqtiired
several decades and the collaboration of Britisl1, French,
and German scholars.
Tl1c key for decipl1ering the Assyrian inscriptions was
st1pplied principally by a boastful text which tl1e Persian
King Darius had carved twenty-five centuries ago on the

ASSYRIA, ISRAEL'S ENEMY
The decipherment of tl1e Persia11 inscription, ,vritten ir1
a cuneiform alphabetic script of forty-t,vo cl1aracters, ,vas
achieved by the combined efforts of a dozen scl1olars, ,vJ10
by acute observatio11 and brilliant deductions read and
translated the text of Darius. With tl1e publication of Ra,v
linson's ''Memoir'' in the journal of the Royal Asiatic So
ciety for 1846, it was apparent that Old Persia11 could at
last be read witl1 a relative degree of certainty.
Working on the assumption, which later proved to
be correct, that the two other texts at Behistun were but
versions of the Old Persian, scholars decipl1ered in a re
markably short time tl1e Elamite and the Akkadian ver
sions. For the latter, a wealth of new material had been
reaching Europe in tl1e late 184o's from the Frencl1 and the
English excavations on the upper Tigris, a circumstance
which stimulated and aided the progress of decipherment.
Particularly note,vorthy 'vas the 'vork of the Rev. Ed
ward Hincks, the rector of the small parish of Killyleagh
in County Do,vn of Ireland, 'vl10 reported 11is progress
in papers read before tl1e Royal Irisl1 Academy. He 'vas tl1e
first to publish a list of tl1e values of the Akkadian cl1arac
ters. A milestone 'vas reached ,vJ1en Ra,vlinson laid !1is
translation of the Akkadian text at Bel1istt1n before tl1e
Royal Asiatic Society in t11e '''inter of 1850-5 i.
It was not, however, t1ntil tl1e sp1·i11g· of i857 t11at tl1e
general public 'vas convinced that Akkadian ct1neiform
could be read. Tl1ere had been so mt1cl1 debate among tl1e
few scholars wl10 'vere 'vorking i11 tl1e field of Akkadia11
that tl1ose outside tl1is small ci1-cle 've1·e skeptical of tl1e
results of the alleged translations. It 'vas W. H. Fox Talbot
who conceived a plan to put an end to these doubts. Wl1y
not give a copy of tl1e same text to four leading autl1orities,
ask them to make independent translations into English,
seal them and deliver to a reliable committee for compari
son?
To the Royal Asiatic Society, Talbot sent a letter on

11itl1erto refused to believe in the truth of the system by
\Vl1icl1 Dr. Hincks and Sir H. Rawlinson have interpreted
tl1e Assy1·ian \Vriting·s, because it contains many things en
tirely contrary to their preconceived opinions."2 He men
tioned tl1e reaction of many that if the system were as in
volved as the scl1olars asserted, the Assyrians themselves
could never have read st1cl1 a \Vriting and continued: ''It
is 'veil kno,vn that Sir H. Rawlinson has announced his
intention of publishing translations of these lithographs
[of a ct1neiform text].... No\v, assuredly it will not add
much to the authority of his translations if other scholars,
after their pt1blication, shall say that they are disposed to
concur in them. . . . But it is evidently quite a different
thing, '\Vhen a translation has been prepared by another
11and befo1·e the appearance of Sir H. Rawlinson's trans
lation, and '\Vithout any communication with him."3 With
tl1is letter 'vent Talbot's own translation in a sealed en
velope.
Promptly tl1e Royal Asiatic Society appointed a dis
tingt1ished committee, including tl1e Dean of St. Paul's,
'vhich sent lithograpl1ed copies of an inscription of Tig
lath-pileser I to Dr. Hincks, Lieut.-Col. Sir H. Rawlinson,
and Dr. Jules Oppert, a Frencl1 scl1olar in the field of Ak
kadia11 studies. In a little more than t\VO months the ''ex

tingt1isl1ed examiners sat in London, each holding one of
tl1e fot1r translations in l1is 11and. As one paragraph of a

they held. Each of the translations was read in this fashion,

ported his treasures over land, river, and sea to Paris and
later published them sumptuously in five volumes. Botta,
the first excavator in Assyria, had the good fortune of hit

The Assyrian King Sargon is mentioned by narne only
once in the Bible, and tl1ere 11e appears only as tl1e king
who sent his commander to take the city of Ashdod (Isaial1
20: 1). But from the discoveries of Botta at Khorsabad it
was soon apparent that it was none other than Sargon "\vl10
was responsible for one of the principal events in tl1e 11is
tory of the people of Israel. For it was 11e who "\Vas tl1e ''ki11g
of Assyria," who ''took Samaria, and carried Israel a\vay
unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor, 011
the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."5 From
this passage one could never have guessed that Sargon
was this king of Assyria, especially since just three verses
before Shalmaneser is mentioned. Shalmaneser had indeed
gone up to Samaria and laid siege to it; but, to,vard the encl
of the three-year siege, Shalmaneser "\vas succeeded by
Sargon, and it was the latter "\Vho finally capt11red tl1e ca1)i
tal of Israel's nortl1ern kingdom. Tl1e capitulatio11 oc
curred in the year 721 B.C.
The text "\vl1icl1 Botta copied f1-om tl1e ,,,alls of tl1e pa lace
of Sargon at Kl1orsabad 'vas promptly publisl1ed in 1849

Tl1e sa1ne campaign is referred to in the Book of Isaiah,

In tl1e year tl1at Tartan [a title of Sargon's Corr1ma11ding

sy1·ia sent l1im, and 11e fot1ght against Ashdod and took
it; at tl1at time the Lord spoke by Isaiah the son of
A1noz, saying: ''Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy
loi11s, a11d put tl1y sl1oe from off tl1y foot." And he did
so, \valking· naked and barefoot. And the Lord said:
•• I,ike as My servant Isaial1 hath walked naked and bare
[oot to be for tl1ree years a sign and a \Vonder upon
Egypt and t1pon Ethiopia, so shall the king of Assyria
lead a\vay tl1e captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethi

of tl1is coast-land shall say in that day: Behold, such is
our expectation, 'vl1ither \Ve fled for help to be delivered

objects of tribt1te on tl1eir sho11lders, or in their hands.
Tl1e animals are the elephant, tl1e rhinoceros, the Bactrian
01· t'''o-h11mped camel, the 'vild bull, the lion, the stag,
a11cl ''ario11s kinds of monkeys." 15 Little did Layard suspect
tl1at tl1e ''p1·isoner'' 'vas soon to be identified by the in
scription as .Jel1u, king of Israel.
Tl1e inscription of tl1e obelisk 'vas carefully copied and
rl1c mon111nent crated for shipment to London. Buffalo
c:arts belonging to the local Pasha 'vere pressed into service
for carrying tl1e crated antiquity to the river. Wrote Lay
ard: ''On Cl1ristmas day I had the satisfaction of seeing a
1·aft, bearing t\venty-three cases, in one of which was the
o!Jelisk, floating down the river. I watched them until they
'vere out of sight, and then galloped into Mosul to cele
brate the festivities of the season, with the few Europeans
'vhom duty or business had collected in this remote corner
of tl1e globe."10 But alas, it was a long time before the
monument reached its destination in the British Museum.

linson 'vrote to tl1e A thenaeum, asking permission to pub

l1ave made witl1in tl1ese few days." 28 He had discovered
tl1at it was Sennacl1erib 'vl10 11ad built tl1e great palace at
Nineveh, and tl1at tl1ere was a cuneiform text 'vl1icl1 stated
that the J udaean King Hezekial1 had paid thirty talents
of gold, as well as otl1er tribute to Sennacherib. And was
tl1is not precisely the amount of gold \vhicl1 Sen11acl1erib
set as tribute upon Hezekiah in Holy Writ?
The Assyrian King Sennacherib makes his appearance
in the Bible in connection with Isaiah, the prophet in the
days of Hezekiah, king of Judah. Beyond this one appear
ance on the scene of Judaean history as the dreaded con
queror of the villages about Jerusalem, little was kno,vn
until Layard's second excavation at Nineveh from October
1849 to April 1851. Here for over a year Layard uncovered
the rich deposit of a palace, laying bare seventy-one rooms
and almost two miles of sculpture and other evidence
which was to illuminate the reign of this po,verful Assyrian
monarch.
A magnificent entrance, decorated witl1 ten colossal
'vinged bulls witl1 l1uman 11eads, guarded tl1e access to tl1e
palace. But more important tl1an tl1e sculptt1re itself 'vas
a series of inscriptions on tl1e bulls wl1icl1 contai11ed tl1e
annals of six years of Sennacl1erib's reign. Tl1ese Laya1·d
carefully copied and sl10\ved to 11is friend Ra,vli11so11 upo11
his return to England a little over a year later. And it '''as
the text of these inscriptions, when taken 'vitl1 texts on clay
cylinders, wl1ich enabled Ra,vlinson to annot1nce so SJJec
tacularly in 1851 his discovery of references to events in
tl1e Bible. Eventually tl1ese inscriptions 'vere sa,ved off
and taken to London. Two of the colossal winged creatures
actually remained in place on the mound at N inevel1 until
1905. But since then they have found their \vay into tl1e
lime-kiln of the natives and no longer exist.

SENNACHERIB AT JERUSALEM
tl1e king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of
.Jt1dal1 three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents
of gold. And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that 'vas
fot1ncl in the hot1se of the Lord, and in the treasures of
tl1e king's house. At that time did Hezekiah ct1t off tl1e
g·olcl from the doors of the temple of the Lord, and
f1-01n tl1e door-posts 'vhich Hezekiah king of Jt1dah l1ad
o\1e1-Iaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. 31
TI1e recovery of the main lines of Assyrian history
c:a111e about st1ddenly. In the short span from 1843 to 1851,
less tl1an a decade, Khorsabad, Nimrud, and Nineveh
yielded their most dramatic treasures. Even at this early
period Assyriologists had not only been able to identify
tl1e great kings, Tiglath-pileser, Sargon, and Sennacherib,
bt1t tl1ey had also found records 'vhich dealt \Vith some of
tl1e most important kings of Israel and Judah. Thus it was
tl1at by the middle of the nineteenth century Israel's his
to1-y 11ad moved out of the isolation which it had once en
joyed and had become a part of world history.
A st1ccessor to Layard, an excavator who came to Nine
\'el1 more than three quarters of a century later, R. Camp
bell Thompson, paid tribt1te to the earlier Assyriologists
in this appropriate observation: ''Champollion and Yot1ng
solved the enigma of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, Schliemann
\\'as to excavate Troy, Arthur Evans was to reveal the palace
of 1\1inos to an unsuspecting \Vorld; but it is doubtful if
any of these can quite equal the combined triumphs of
tl1e early Assyriologists of the middle of the last century,
\\'110 not only uncovered palace after palace, but solved
tl1e riddle of the cuneiform on their walls." 32

MYTH IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST
a book of limited, scl1olarly interest. But with his ann<)ttnce
ment of the discovery of tl1e Flood story, l1e became i1nmecli
ately \Vorld famous.
George Smitl1 e11clccl l1is paper on December 3rd '''ith a
guess that beneatl1 tl1e motinds of ancient Assyria there
now ''lay, tog·etl1er \Vitl1 older copies of this Deluge text,
other legends and 11istories."3 Sensing the ne\vs value of
tl1is sensational discovery and hopeful for more revelations
of popular interest, the London Daily Teleg1·aph proposed,
immediately after Smith's lect11re, the reopening of the
excavations at Ninevel1 and at the expense of the ne\vs
paper. If George Smith could get together tl1is story from
the scraps of tablets in tl1e archives of the British Museum,
could 11e not find even more important material in the
library at ancient N inevel1 itself?
Within less than t\vo months after the announcement
before tl1e Society of Biblical Archaeology, Smith \\'as on
l1is \vay to Nineveh, \Vith a grant of 1,000 guineas from the
Daily TelegrajJh, a six months' leave from his \vork at the
Museum, and hig·l1 l1opes of finding tablets \vhicl1 'vould
fill in some of tl1e g·aps in the epic to 'vhich the Flood
story belong·ed.
Work at Nine\1el1 g·ot tinder 'vay by May 7th. A 'veek
later Smitl1 sat do\v11 to examine some fragments of cunei
form inscriptio11s from tl1e day's digging. As he brushed
off tl1e ea1-tl1 f1-01n one of tl1ese, he recog·nized tl1at l1c had
discovered a frag·1nent containing· seventeen lines \vl1icl1
belonged to a missi11g po1·tion of tl1e first column of the
Del11ge tablet a11d 'vl1icl1 filled up tl1e only se1·ious g·ap i11
tl1e story. In fact, in l1is paper read in London six months
before, he 11ad guessed tl1at tl1ere \Vere abotit fifteen lines

It is understandable tl1at inte1·est i11 tl1e Gilg·a1nesl1 e1Jic
11as centered mainly on tl1e story of tl1e Flood i11 its
eleventl1 tablet. But tl1is concentration 11pon tl1e pa1·t of tl1e

Genesis has led to tl1e l1eg·lect of significa11t i·ese1nbla11ces
between Gilg·amesl1 and otl1er parts of biblical literatt11·e.
A notable exception to tl1is l1eglect is tl1e \vork of Peter
Jensen, Professor of Semitic Pl1ilology at tl1e University of
Marburg. In the wake of earlier and important studies on
the text of Gilgamesh, Jensen published, in igo6, a book
of over a tl1ousand pages in which l1e soug·l1t to prove that
the character of Gilgamesl1 was tl1e ancient prototype of

liberato1-s, as \veil as the central figure of the Gospels. Dis

title J\loses, Jesus, Paitlus: Drei Varianten des babyloni
sclien Gottmenschen Gilgamesch (Moses, Jesus, Paul:
Tl11-ee Variants of tl1e Babylonian God-Man Gilgamesl1),
a 'vork \vhich he labeled an ''attack upon the theologians,
an appeal to laymen." Follo\ving the extreme claims made
i11 tl1ese t\VO books, a11d in a tl1ird published in 1926, the
g11estion of possible parallels has not been pursued f11rther.
Gilgamesh s11ffered much l1a1111 at the hands of his friend
.J ense11.
'fl1e literary value of Gilgamesh as one of the world's
great and earliest epics has not been unnoticed. In 1934,
tl1e American poet William Ellery Leonard noted the
•
t1·eatment of the central themes of ''sex-love, combat,
friendsl1ip, adventure, valo11r, loyalty, the mountain, the
fielcJ, the forest, the 'vild beasts, the sea, the storm, the
g·ods, the mysteries of birth and death," 7 and set the epic
ir1 free rhytl1ms. More recently, D. G. Bridson, of the
l~ritisl1 Broadcasting Corporation, paraphrased the transla
tion of E. A. Speiser and, \Vi th a cast of actors and actresses,
1)1-esented it over the BBC Third Programme on Novem
l)er 2 g, 1954.
The first tablet of t11e epic opens \Vith the introd11ction
of the central character of the story, Gilgamesh. He, like
Oclysse11s, had seen and suffered much. In Uruk, which
\Vas his home, he had b11ilt the wall and the pure sanctu
ary of Ishtar, end11ring monuments which all could in
spect, tl1e tokens of his g·reatness. Arithmetically, his great
ness is described in terms of his being two-thirds god and
011e-third man.
In an arrogant way Gilgamesh has been oppressing those
'vho lived in the famed Uruk, leaving not the son to his
father, nor the maid to her mother. When the people of

After crossing difficult mountains and sailing across tlic
Waters of Deatl1, Gilga111esl1 at last 1neets lTt11ar)isl1ti111,
\vho disco11rses on the theme of the lack of permanency
\Vi th specific reference to the transiency of life itself:
Do we build a l1011se for ever?
Do we seal contracts for ever?
Do brotl1ers divide shares for ever?
Does hatred persist for ever in the land?
Does the river for ever raise up and bring on floods?
TI1e dragon-fly leaves its shell
That its face might but glance at the face of the s1111.
Since the days of yore tl1ere l1as been no per1nanence;
The resting and the dead, ho'v alike they are! 20
These gloomy reflections are apparently not s11fficient
to deter Gilgamesl1 from his search; he persists by asking
Utnapishtim ho'v it \Vas that he achieved his deathless
state. The reply is the long story of his sal\1ation from the
flood tl1rough obedience to the god Ea. At the concl11sion
of the recital of this story, Utnapishtim sets a test for Gil
gamesh to try his heroism: ··up, lie not do,vn to sleep for
six days and seven nights." B11t the 'veak humanity of Gil
gamesh is soon apparent:
As he sits there on his haunches,
Sleep fans him like the \vhirlwind.
Utnapishtim says to her, to his spouse:
''Behold this hero who seeks life!
Sleep fans him like a mist."21

CONFLIC'f AND CREATION
...\fte1· seven days of sleep Gilg·amesh awakens, tl1inking
tl1at lie l1as dozed but b1·iefly until he is convinced by his
I1ost of l1is failt1re to meet the test. After a bath and a cl1ange
of clotl1es, Gilga111esh is delivered into tl1e hands of Urshan
abi, tl1e boatman, for return to 11is O\Vn city. At the depar
ture of tl1e disappointed hero, tl1e wife of U tnapisl1tim
i11tercedes to persuade her l1t1sband to re\vard him for his
perilous journey. Thereupon, Utnapishtim reveals a hid
den thing: a thorny plant at the bottom of the sea, if
grasped, \vill assure life. By tying heavy stones to his feet,
Gilg·amesh descends to the deep and obtains the plant,
\vl1ich he calls ''Man Becomes Young in Old Age." How
ever, on the homeward journey, Gilgamesh stops for the
night, and 'vhile he is bathing in a cool pool of \Vater,
a serpent snuffs the fragrance of the plant and carries it
off. Immediately the serpent sheds its cast skin a sure
sig·11 of tl1e powers of tl1e magic plant which Gilgamesh once
l1ad a11d has no\V lost.
1' rustrated in 11is search, Gilgamesh returns to U ruk, tl1e
city from \vhich he l1ad set out on his useless quest. He no\v
kno,vs that ''\vhen the gods created mankind, death for
111ankind they set aside."
.'\ltl1oug·h George Smitl1's tablets belonged to the seventl1
century, more recent researcl1 11as demonstrated that the
epic of Gilgamesh \Vas composed shortly after 2000 n.c. by
a Babylonian poet. The long life and the \vide currency of
tl1e epic attest the vitality of tl1is artistic statement of \vhat
may be called a pre-Greek philosophy.
CONFLICT AND CREATION
England's appetite for Babylonian legends had been
\vl1etted by George Smith's discovery of the story of the
r;lood on tablets \vhich had come from the library of Ash
urbanipal. The public did not have to wait long for an
even more spectacular announcement from this youthft1l
\vorker on the N inevite tablets recovered by Layard, H.

A year later, Smith published a volume giving t1·anslations
of the contents of about t\venty fragments of tl1e seven
tablet account of Creation.
These ne\v discoveries were bound to give rise to reli
gious controversy. A generation after the initial discoveries
by Smith in England, a German Assyriologist, Friedricl1
Delitzsch, in 1902 was invited to give a private lecture,
\vhich he called ''Babel and Bible," before the Ger1nan
Emperor at the Royal Palace in Berlin. In it, Delitzscl1
pointed to the similarities between biblical and Babylonian
stories and emphasized the importance of Assyriolog·y as a
new tool for understanding the Bible. His purpose see111s
to have been to gain support for German expeditions into
this field, which up until this time had been '''01-ked Sll
successfully by the Eng·lisl1 and the Frencl1. He i-e1nindecl
the Emperor that it \vas ''high time tl1at Ge1·111any toci
sl1ot1ld pitcl1 11e1- te11t 011 tl1e pal111-cro\vned l)anks of tlit·

As a result of tl1e general interest in Assyrian clisco,·e1·
ies and the extrao1-dina1-y ci1-cumstance of the 1)1·i,·ate lec·
ture before tl1e Empero1·, tl1e text \Vas pt1blisl1ed fa1· ancl
\vide, and ''Babel and Bible'' quickly became a st1bject of
controversy not only in Germany but abroad. Typical of
the storm of criticism \vl1icl1 descended on Delitzscl1 \Vas an

MYTH IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST
In time, several generations of gods sprang from tl1e
first pair. Alienated from tl1e older Apsu and Tia1nat, tl1e
yot1ng·er gods joined tog·etl1er, and, under tl1e leade1·sl1ip
of Ea, tl1e \vise eartl1- and \Vate1·-g·od, succeeded in slaying
tl1e pri1nordial Apsu, \vl10 11ad i·esol ved to destroy 11is de
scendants. Tl1is act of viole11ce tl1e pri1nordial Tiamat, the
1notl1er, determines to avenge by a \vell-plan11ed attack 011
tl1e gods. M ucl1 of tl1e dra111atic poe1n deals \Vi tl1 tl1e prep
aration for her attack and the cl1oice and equipment of
Marduk as a suitable champio11 to oppose this ancient god
dess of tl1e primordial chaos.

''Lord, truly thy decree is first among gods.

At the word of his mouth the cloth vanished.

that is slain; Tl1ou didst scatter Tl1ine ene111ies \Vitl1 tl1e

to the arm of Yahweh in Isaial1 51 :g, \vl1ere tl1e poet asks:
''Art tl1ou not it that he\\1ed Ral1ab in pieces, tl1at pie1·cecl
tl1e dragon?'' This same idea of tl1e slaying of tl1e monster
appears, as we have seen above, in tl1e literature from Ras
Shamra, and may well be tl1e prototype of tl1e later legend
of St. George and the Dragon. Tl1ese pagan and mytl1ologi

MYTH IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST
The find cot1ld not long be kept a secret. An Egyptian
who had come upon a particularly good specimen of these
tablets one about 20 incl1es long hoping for a better
market in a larger city, concealed it in his unde1·garments
and proceeded to board the train for Cairo. But, as he
stepped into tl1e rail\\1ay coach, the tablet slipped from his
clothes, fell on the bed of the railway, and broke into many
pieces. Villagers talked so freely of the poor man's misfor
tune that word of the discovery soon reached the ears of
the Director of Antiquities, \vho set out to retrieve the col
lection, \vhich by this time had fallen into many hands. His
efforts served to accelerate the disposal of the loot, so that
it was quickly scattered, never again to be collected ex
cept in a publication twenty years later by the Nor,vegian
Assyriologist J. A. Knudtzon.
Since the discovery in 1887, there have been achaeo·
logical ex:cavations at Tell el-Amarna, but none has been as
fortunate as that of the unkno\vn Egyptian \voman \vl10
made the first find of cuneiform tablets. Her collection is
no1v scattered in London, Berlin, Paris, Istanbt1l, Leni11
grad, Brussels, Cl1icago, and N e\v York, and, \vitl1 tl1e rela
tively meager disco\1eries of 1vestern arcl1aeolog·ists, the

bor1·0,vers substituted their o'~'n gods or at least the Se
1nitic names for St1merian gods and translated tl1e myths
and epics into tl1eir o'vn Semitic language.
A good example of this borro,ving is tl1e Flood story.
Long kno\vn from tl1e Hebre'v versior1 in Genesis, later
1·ecognized in the Assyrian version of the eleventl1 tablet
of tl1e Gilg·amesh epic, and even later traced back by frag
n1ents of certain elements to tl1e Old Babylonian period,
tl1e story has recently been found written in Sumerian, a
language 'vl1ich antedates both Assyrian and Babylonian.
Tl1e clay tablet \vhich contains the earliest account of
tl1e Flood came from the first American excavation of a Su
merian site in Mesopotamia, tl1e University of Pennsyl
\'ania's excavation at Nippt1r. Thro11gh four long cam
l)aigns, extending over the years 1889 to 1 goo, the excava
tors of N ippt1r 'vere successful in recovering approximately
30,000 tablets a11d fragments most of them written in the
Sumeria11 langt1age. For over fifty years this remarkably
ricl1 library of Sumerian materials unfortunately split tip
into three collections, one i11 Philadelpl1ia, another in
Istanbul, and a thircl in Jena, Eastern Germany has pro
vided tl1e source for mt1ch of ot1r kno,vledge of S11merian
mytl1ology, as these tablets l1ave gradually been copied and
translated. And yet, after more tl1an a l1alf century, scholars
are still ''unearthing'' a 'vealth of ne'v material from these
collections long buried in museums.
The translation of tl1e S11merian flood story did not ap
pear until fourteen years after the last of the four early
seasons of excavation at N ippur. In this version the l1ero of
tl1e Flood is Zius11cl1·a, tl1e prototy1)e (>f tl1e lJil)lical N (Ja!1
and of tl1e Akkadian Utnapishtim. Ziusudra, a pious and
god-fearing king, stands by a 'vall, where he learns of the
decree of the gods ''to destroy the seed of mankind." From
a fragmentary text, we can read of events with which we
are already familiar from later versions:

had suspected to have been in existence. One such extraor
dinary case was the discovery of tl1e three large pieces of
the famous Code of Hammurabi at Susa in December 190 i

On the basis of tl1e publication a fe,.v years earlier of clay
tablets containing la\vs from tl1e Old Babylonian period,
Friedrich Delitzsch, in his famous lecture of 1902, ''Babel
and Bible," said: ''After Hammurabi 11ad succeeded in

organized the famous Delegation en Perse, having pre
viously obtained from Nassr ed-Din, Shah of Persia, the
exclusive right to carry on archaeological research in that
country. The French Parliament generously alloted 100,

The speed \vitl1 \vl1ich this important doct1n1e11t \vas
publisl1ed in scientific form \vas due largely to tl1e cl1oice
by Jacques de Morgan of a brilliant Assyriologist, Pere
.Jean Vincent Schei!, as a member of the team of tl1e
Delegation. So familiar \Vas Scheil \Vith ct1neiform texts
that he required only tl1ree months to translate and pub
lisl1 tl1e famous Code of Hammurabi. By the encl of tl1e year
1902, less than one year after the discovery, the e(filio
jJrinceps of the Code had appeared in a folio volume c)f
the Memoires of the Delegation en Perse. This pt1lJlication
is an enduring monument to the genius, competence, ancl
dispatch of Pere Scheil.
The la\vs tl1emselves are preceded by a lengtl1y 1)ro]()gt1e,
in \Vl1icl1 Hammt1rabi, in the first person singular and \Vitl1
no false moclesty, tells of his efforts as tl1e \Vise sl1e1)l1ercl of

to cause justice to prevail in the land,
to destroy the wicked and the evil,
tl1at the strong might not oppress the \veak,
to rise like the sun over the black-headed peo1)lc.
and to light up the land.4
In an epilogue, even more prolix than the prologue, the
king recounts in verse the achievements of his reign in the
promoting of the 'velfare of the land. That the strong

shall be put to death.
If a hierodule, a nun, 'vl10 is not living in a convent,

ly l1ad ten columns of text on eacl1 side. The fragn1ents had
actt1ally been ''discovered'' at Nippur, in southern Baby

By careft1lly piecing together the fragments and by

epilog·ue there is a correspondence in the curse which Lipit
Isl1tar utters on him '',vho will commit some evil deed \Vitl1

enter the storeroom and change its pedestal, who \vill erase

the lad went into his stable, and he took a big jar, for
he wanted to carry off a lot of seed. So he loaded 11imsel£

formists have independently come to the conclusion that
tl1e composition is a caricature, and that it was intended as
a broad satire and not as ponderous philosophizing. 82
Whatever the intention of the author, the \Vork is re1n
iniscent of the attitude of the ''gentle cynic'' \vho \vrote tl1e
biblical Book of Ecclesiastes. Parts of tl1e dialogue follo\\':
Dining:
''Servant, obey me."
Yes, my lord, yes.
''Bring me at once •vater for my hands, and give it
to me: I wish to dine."
Dine, my lord, dine. To dine regularly is the opening
of the heart [i.e. brings joy]. To a dinner eaten in
happiness and with •vashed hands the sun-god Shamash
comes.
''No, servant, I shall not dine."
Do not dine, my lord, do not dine. To be l1ung1·y ancl
eat, to be thirsty and drink, comes 11pon every 111an.
Rebellion:
''Servant, obey me."
Yes, my lord, yes.
''I intend to start a rebellion."
Do it, my lord, do it. If you do not start a 1·ebellio11
•vhat becomes of your clay? "\Vl10 \\1ill give yo11 sometl1ing·

''No, servant, I shall not do something violent."
Do it not, my lord, do it not. The man doing so1ne
thing violent is killed or ill-treated, or l1e is n1aimed,
or captured and cast into prison.
Love:
''Servant, obey me."
Yes, my lord, yes.
''A woman will I love."

Yes, love, my lord, love. The man who loves a woman
fo1·gets pain and trouble.
''No, servant, a woman I shall not love."
Do not love, my lord, do not love. Woman is a well,

Sacrifice to a g·od:
''Servant, obey me."
Yes, my lord, yes.
''Bring· ine at once 'vater for my 11ands, and give it to
me:
I 'vill offer a sacrifice to my god."
Offer, my lord, offer. A man offering sacrifice to his
god is happy, loan upon loan he makes.
''No, servant, a sacrifice to my god will I not offer."
Do not offer it, my lord, do not offer it. You may
teach a god to trot after you like a dog when he requires
of you, saying, ''Celebrate my ritual'' or ''do not inquire
by requesting an oracle'' or anything else.
PL1blic service:
''Servant, obey me."
Yes, my lord, yes.
''I \viii do something 11elpful for my country."
Do it, my lord, do it. The man who does something
l1elpful for his country, his helpful deed is placed in
tl1e bowl of Marduk.
''No, servant, I will not do something helpful for my
cot1ntry."
Do it not, my lord, do it not. Climb the mounds of
ancient ruins and 'valk about: look at the skulls of late

a public benefactor?
Suicide and murder:

POSTSCRIPT
LIKE SAUL, who had gone in search of his father's strayed
asses and found a kingdom, the archaeologist 'vho 'vent
out to the lands of the Bible fo11nd far more than he had
expected. At most, the span of time covered by the Bible
is two thousand years; the mounds and caves of the Near
East have borne evidence to document human culture ex
tending over a period several times the length of this
biblical span. Jericho was a 'valled city some four thousand
years or more before its walls fell before Joshua, and the
cities of lower Mesopotamia had a written literature some
fifteen hundred years before Abraham left Ur. The sto1·y
of man in the ancient Near East is longer and more com
plex than the seventeenth-century biblical chronology of
Archbishop James Ussher, still printed in the margin of
many Bibles, allowed one to believe.
Modern researcl1 has not only extended the time span of
antiquity; it has enlarged the area of the kno,vn ancient
\Vorld. N e'v peoples, 'vi th languages 'vhich have been deci
phered and translated, have made tl1eir appearance on tl1e
scene. In the rich harvest of written materials 'vl1ich ha,1e
come from what \\1as once called narro,vly ''Bible lands,"
ne\v claims for detailed research l1ave been staked 011t;
special disciplines l1ave arisen, such as Egyptology, Hit
titology, Su1nerolog·y, and Akkadian and Ugaritic studies
each 'vith its O\vn set of problems of language and history.
In the Bible tl1e1·e are a few scattered references to a
people called Horites, but little more than tl1e name ap
pears. It is no'v known that these biblical Horites 'vere none
other than the Hurrians, a group of people who played a
major role in the history of the Near East during tl1e second
millennium B.c. For these few barren references in the Bible

POSTSCRIPT
The picture of tl1e religion of Canaan which has emerg·ed
in the century since Renan first went to Syria in 1860 has
served to reveal the true significance of the conflict bet,veen
the intractable Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mt.
Carmel, when the prophet of tl1e Lord challenged, ''if tl1e
Lord be God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him." The
Canaanite polytheism and its aim to achieve fertility stand
revealed as something utterly different from the mon
otheistic religion of Israel.
The recovery of the history of ancient Assyria has served
to anchor the chronology of Israel's history firmly into the
scheme of world events. The authority of the Book of Kings
as a historical source needs no longer to rest on the theolog
ical dogma of inspiration; numerous details have been
adequately confirmed by the discovery of Assyrian records
which supply independent witness to the events described.
Assyria, that wolflike enemy of Israel, which frequently
proved to be a catalyst for Hebrew prophecy, has emerged
as the terror which Isaiah had pictured.
Ancient Near Eastern mythology, as it has come to ligl1t
from Assyria, Babylonia, and Anatolia, has, like Canaanite
theology, served to emphasize the unique character of
Hebrew monotheism. From such stories as tl1ose of tl1e
Flood and Creation found in Sumero-Akkadian 'vritings.
it is clear that certain cosmological notions \Vere '''idely
spread in the ancient world and that the Hebre,vs 11tilized
some of the universally held vie,vs as a setting for tl1ei1·
O\Vn distinctive monotl1eistic and ethical beliefs. Yet, one
must say, I think, that the contrast is more apparent tl1a11
the likeness. Again, the ne,vly-discovered mytl1ology of tl1e
ancient Near East supports the claim that Israel was in,
but not of, the ancient world.
The cases in which tl1ere may have been direct borro,v
ings on the part of the Hebre\v \vriters of la\v and \visdom
from their colleagues in Mesopotamia and Egypt are few;
and even these few cases are open to question. Nevertl1e
less, a variety of basic concepts and concerns turn out to be

dorn propounded by tl1e \vise inen of Egypt are not 'vith
OLlt tl1ei1- counterparts in tl1e Book of Proverbs.
As one surveys the list of tl1ose who have contributed
to tl1e enlargement of biblical kno,vledge in the past cen
tury, l1e cannot ignore the fact that this period of study
ina1·ks a new epoch. Tl1e Bible as sacred history was for
many centuries tl1e particular province of the priest, the
scribe, the monk, and the theologian. In the most recent
period, its history has been the concern of such a varied
group as consular agents, adventurers, royal engineers, an
apprenticed bank-note eng·1-aver, epigraphists, philologists,
and professional archaeolog·ists. Important discoveries have
been made by Renan, tl1e skeptic, by de Vaux, the Domin
ican Father, by Parker, tl1e adventurer, and even by a
sl1epherd boy of the Taamireh Bedouin. As the Bible has
moved into the main stream of \Vorld history, its study
l1as become the interest and concern of a larger and more
varied group of scholars.
One may \vell ask, Have tl1e rich mines of antiquity been
exhausted? A moral \vl1icl1 emerges from this review of
moclern discovery is tl1at tl1e unexpected has come to pass
time and time again. The finding of Canaanite poetry at
Ras Shamra in 1929, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls
and the buildings of the community at Qumran, the turn
ing up of a frag·ment of the Gilgamesh tablet at Megiddo
on a dump heap, the discovery of three codes of law older
tl1an Hammurabi in the span of less than a decade, the
unearthing of jar-handles inscribed with ''Gibeon'' at el
Jib, Neolithic and New Testament Jericho these are
some of the surprises of archaeology in recent years. Near
Eastern archaeology does not yet seem to have reached the
point of diminishing returns.
