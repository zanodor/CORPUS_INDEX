eBook Description
The niftiest 'Sumerian Cuneiform English Dictionary' in the university world:
The unique "MUGSAR 4-Way"
1. unicode 2. sign 3. lemma 4. translation
All on one screen. At elite university sites it's all over the place. None give unicodes and their translations are superficial / computer generated.
The real nifty part, the "MUGSAR QuickFinder Index"
Specially designed for small 'tablet' screens that may not be able to display cuneiform fonts.
..
The first great civilization (fl c. 6600CT - 8000CT) were the Sumerians - "ki.en.gi", who were black ('saĝ gig.ga') to boot! For the enlightened Sumer is aptly termed the 'cradle of civilization'.
Much has been plagiarized from them without due attribution, not just the wheel, writing, law, but even true etymologies - the real origins of so many English words like 'abzu' = abyss, not to mention 'shekel', the Hebrew term for money -- some would have us believe that everything starts with the Greeks and Romans, world champion plagiarizers themselves. Our libraries may as well forget the non-fiction / history section - just put it all under fiction. How some can relegate this great civilization to what's conjured by terms like "ancient" and "BC". It's not going backwards, they come first at about 6600CT.

Tablet 1
Inspiration for all this came out of not being able to find a Sumerian cuneiform sign list with unicode, lemma and translation. There are some amazing dedicated websites and books produced by some amazing academes {missing fragment} ...from the experience of living in Japan and studying kan-ji, it became obvious that you have to have the logogram, reading and translation all together. Just reading and translation is useless. And now of course linking everything is the unicode – see our unique 'MUGSAR 4-Way', an example:



..
Inana and the Seven Cosmic Powers of her Loincloth u4-/ba nin-ĝu10 an\ mu-un-niĝin2-na-ta Once, my dear lady heaven roamed around, cpd cpd 1222C 1202D cpd closeup
ud-ba nin - ĝu10 an\ /mu-un-niĝin2-na-ta\ Once 12313 UD day + 12040 BA open halve
lady, mistress 122A9 MUG + 12306 TUG2 garment

heaven roamed around 1222C MU name + 12326 UN (KALAM = Sumer) + 121B8 niĝin2 encircle + 1223E NA incense + 122EB TA much
Some well funded universities like Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, ETCSL et al have everything separated, don't give unicodes at all, and for the sign they link off to PSD (University of Pennsylvania) where it is often not clear which is the relevant one. And their translations are superficial, probably computer generated. When you work with the actual cuneiform signs, rather than just impotent readings using our boring English phonetic script, you start to see that the scribes were not just telling a story, but literally painting the scene.



When we start going deeper than such misleading translations it becomes very revealing. It's not just that to the chagrin of some, that the Sumerians keep referring to themselves as black, there's a sign in particular that clearly tells us that the very first professors, scholars, experts, master craftsman, the ones who could write and teach, were black...
...and 'um-mi-a' is not just of a more recent period of only 4000 years ago (Ur III) it goes way back to over 5000 years ago (ED IIIb) [a good 2000 years before the Greeks et al]:
..
..



Gilgamesh, the hero of oldest written epic is also black BIL.GA.MEŠ (Sumerian: Bilgamesh [cf. Billjim!]; Akkad.: Gilgamesh) [1224B BIL2 burnt + 120B5 GA young (bull) + 12229
mes (meš) black hero (next on the sign list is the more common black sign 1222A MI; and 1207E dub able to write = power connotation)]
And not only were the first scholars black, the earliest known author and poet was female (and most likely black), Enheduanna.
..
It's even more bewildering when you see someone like Jeremy Black ('1951-'2004) founder of ETCSL, publish Literature of Ancient Sumer but leaves out the actual cuneiform. Starting with the Introduction (see Google Books) he adeptly covers the nuances using the awesome 9x6cm tablet containing 16 lines of Nertal's Axe story, encouraging the reader to begin to feel how enchanting Sumerian cuneiform is. Yet he sticks solely to what he calls "our Latin alphabet" (didn't it come west via the Phoenicians [Lebanon], as in the phonetic alphabet!) in giving Sumerian readings and transliteration. Straight off he could have shown he was going to be totally faithful. Why not show us the beautiful picture of the magical axe, which when we go hunting for it on his own ETCSL baby (c573.4) we
find (hazin, see 12154). What a shame. Jeremy must have known the signs intimately, and could have told us so much about his personal findings on their evolution and little things to look for in the pictures.
..
The scribes who invented writing 5000 years ago clearly had no inhibitions about the basis for the
design of their cuneiform, nor should we bowdlerize [etym.: Thomas Bowdler expurgated William Shakespeare
(aka Edward de Vere) '1822] for hypocritical luddites / puritans who are still happy to plagiarize the technology revolution started by the Sumerians, and it may well have been the inspiration for the whole style ~ cunei.form = cunteus writing.
Scratching and dragging a pointed stylus would not have been near as effective and enduring for us to be able to read now. And it can be no coincidence that the Sumerian apotheosis of 'woman'
through the cunteus -shaped v sign has come down to us as the first letter of vagina, a fundamental example of our True Etymology campaign.
..
To top it off, at long last, for the many frustrated cuneophiles out there, comes the nifty MUGSAR QuickFinder Index. Can you find an elite university that nifty?
Oh, and if any nuts were looking for evidence that these first great civilizations got some help from aliens ...well, your first glance at the arrangement of many signs sure reminds one of spaceships,
docking modules, rocket thruster exhausts – take a look at 12217 LUGAL King he's in a spaceship man! As you would expect for the King of the Sumerians / "Kings of the Earthlings".
Seriously though, enduring Sumerian picture script on tablets offers us a lot more than say Greek phonetic writing on papyrus (much of it disintegrated almost immediately). One might first say that for starters the Greeks were much more intellectual. But how much of the basics were plagiarized from the Sumerians.



With the tablets we have a conduit, like electrons through a main circuit travelling at the speed of light straight back 5000 years ago. Analogous to astronomers and their powerful telescopes peering back into the evolution of galaxies (now there's an aptly interesting True Etymology – see 120F2 GAL big) and the universe. The pictures the scribes have transmitted on those tablets impress a profound insight into exactly how the people of the first civilization were thinking. Even with only a basic familiarity with the meanings of the logograms, it can be like watching timeshifted live video. Much more fascinating than the most expensive Steven Speilberg blockbuster but then what's a movie without a scriptwriter, and we're talking about the very first writers ever, who put down the motifs of Gilgamesh and Inana.
Stop a moment and think about it. Put the huge amount of time in perspective. In that time many cultures did not develop writing at all, some had it and lost it. When plagio-religio somehow began to dominate the Romans the West was plunged into the Dark Ages, ironically only a bunch of monks were allowed to rehash one group of stories with a flood story, etc., plagiarized from guess where. Writing has really only started to make a comeback in the last few hundred years after the
Renaissance / Enlightenment (even Guillem Shaksper's Stratford daughter couldn't write). That's less than 10% of the
timeline back to the Sumerians.
So at the next party you can say "I like movies" or "I'm studying a second language, French..." or
you can say, "I'm a collaborator on the MUGSAR ... a nifty little (they had it a bit before Steve Jobs!) we are developing so anyone can watch the Sumerians walking around 5000 years ago..."

MUGSAR Home School / University Tender
To be the official school / university home for MUGSAR, the niftiest Cuneiform Dictionary in the world, and show up the shortcomings of University of Oxford et al. Every elite educational institution needs to be able to show prospective students, and their parents, that they have something special to offer, not just in general social sciences, but the oldest written language. A semester introductory course to Sumerian cuneiform revolving around our MUGSAR would kick things off.
For proof of 'niftiest', compare the others, see which one gives the quickest introductory grasp and familiarity with the actual Sumerian cuneiform.
Oxford has theirs under 'Faculty of Oriental Studies'. A bit degrading since the West plagiarized so much from the Sumerians. We would designate ours, 'Faculty of True Origins' which would not only update the MUGSAR with more 4-Way translations but would also be the official publisher of the world's first True Etymology Dictionary tracing word roots back 2000+ years beyond Greek and Latin to Sumerian. All very prestigious indeed.
It would be nice if MUGSAR's home could be our local University of NSW, with affiliation to a high school where Tara might be going ('2015-Year 7) like Sydney Girls or Randwick Girls. But it if they don't see the potential international prestige, who knows maybe Melbourne, or even in in another country.

How to use
The Main Listings follow same order as the standard cuneiform unicode (alpha-numeric) column after column (why didn't the powers that be just keep the codes sequentially all numeric?!). If you only have the sign try Major Lemma, then the QuickFinder Index. First lemma (reading / syllable) after grapheme is usually the 'sign name', sometimes the Sumerian name as well, as are any other readings / aliases after that. Gradually adding compounds. Cuneiform fonts have been replaced with jpg graphics because some tablets do not display them. Clearer shots of logograms will come eventually, for now use ScriptSource (click on first result for even bigger size) or Google Images (e.g. "unicode 120F6").
And the MUGSAR is proudly, and primarily, a Sumerian dictionary of the first writers, not Akkadian, Babylonian nor Hittite ones. So we pretty much are only interested in lemma that go back to at least Ur III (8000CT / 4000ya). Nor lemma that have 0x attestations. Again there are some great lexicons around but they include a big chunk of this latter stuff, when plagiarizing the Sumerians was in full swing. And don't even show attestations, nor you know what... it's bad enough that there are no signs, but to think that much is not even Sterling-Sumerian, or rarely used, well.
You may notice with sign evolution, that it goes from the proto drawings to the cool Sumerian cuneiform, and then about 1000 years after them the fanastic pictures are lost through over simplification and the move to bland phonetic script. Who wants to look at that kind of dictionary.
Some may say the first writers are lacking more intellectual concepts. But maybe those can still come. There's two ways for them to still make it into MUGSAR one day: 1) such cuneiform may eventually be unearthed 2) as we take in so many awesome signs gathered together on one *QF* screen (not java programmed all over the place – will PSD be as easy as the MUGSAR to pass on to future generations via the Internet Archive?!) the more familiar we get with the way Sumerian (not Akkadian, Greek, Roman et al) scribes were thinking 4-5000 years ago, then you know what we could be capable of? If we can start thinking like a scribe, why shouldn't we be able to pick up the stylus, and carry on their work, by fusing any missing intellectual cuneiform, including rendering of new technology terms.
And so, that's why we are proudly snobs of MUGSAR!

MUGSAR file format convert tips
Kindle (Paperwhite) is our favoured eReader (trying to get away from couch potato game-tempting, bright screened, hotter, heavier, battery-sucking tablets was part of the inspiration for MUGSAR). Just send (to your username@kindle.com) our Word .docx file (you can find the latest upload here) 'as is' [Do NOT add "convert" to the subject line, it stuffs it up] straight to your Kindle – it comes up just perfect. Kindle now uses .kf8 (aka .azw3) cf. the old .azw / .mobi
PDF - Though still very common for now, has many limitations, esp as a source format for conversion – Calibre FAQs say it's a crap format: "In order of decreasing preference: LIT, MOBI, AZW, EPUB, AZW3 (aka KF8), FB2, DOCX, HTML, PRC, ODT, RTF, PDB, TXT, PDF".
ePUB - The most common eReader format is ePUB, and even better, it's 'open source'. MUGSAR ePUB version is now available from the Internet Archive.
Free Convert Software - The most popular seems to be Calibre.

A curious development from EME [12174 tongue] 'voice-emit' = 'make a sound' is found in Jaritz #721, which depicts a 'sail with rigging' [cf. harbinger for antenna, radio signal] and reads *îm(i) (for *îm(i)); it means 'wind, storm-wind'; i.e. 'moaning (of the wind), pars pro toto' [a part (taken) for the whole]. Strong support for this analysis is furnished by another meaning attached to this sign: 'fear'; this is understandable for 'moaning' but not for simply 'wind' or 'storm(-wind)'. 'Moaning' has
attracted the reading ni2 [1224E ] 'be afraid', 'fear', which represents 'snivel-stative-like' = 'sniveling' = 'fear'.

[PLM] Jaritz #889 depicts a 'short vertical line abutting a longer horizontal line at its midpoint'. It means 'speak, call, tongue, middle, converse'. Graphic convention designed to bring out the idea of 'middle', the position associated in early thinking with the placement of the tongue in the mouth. Somewhat surprisingly, this simple element has been identified for PIE as *me, 'in the middle, into the middle'. *me is not regarded as meaning 'tongue'; that meaning has been taken by a derivation from it, eme (for
*îmî) [12174 ] another reading of the same sign, which represents 'teeth-middle' = 'tongue'. This compound can be found in PIE with *empi-, 'mosquito', an animal that definitely deserves to be named for its tongue.

Woolley [born '1880 in 13 Southwold Road just around the corner from King's Place (now BSix College Brooke House - East London
Hackney-Stratford where the '2012 Olympics Games were held) where Edward de Vere wrote 'Shake-speares Sonnets' - only because
he was setup by another forgotten proto-feminist, 2nd wife Elizabeth Trentham]; she represented a strong and creative personality, an
educated woman, and one who fulfilled diverse roles in a complex society, not unlike women's aspirations today...[Jane Roberts];
"My goddess gave birth to your god" ... Assyriologist William Hallo referred to her as "The Sumerian Shakespeare". But given that
she preceded Shakespeare by several thousand years, it might be more apt to dub the bard "The English Enheduanna" [Kristin
Agudelo's notablewomen]; or "Enheduanna of Tudor Literature" [chickhistory]; ironically also lost to history is Susan de Vere,

122BA SHE / ŠE | niga, nigu = [28315x!] barley, grain; unit of length / area / volume / weight; shekel | True Etymology: origin of Hebrew term for money 'she-kel' re price of bushel of grain | niga [12565x] = to be fattened
"Money, like certain other essential elements in civilization, is a far more ancient institution than we were taught to believe ... the oldest coin currency that we know is a Sumerian bronze piece dating from before 7000CT / 3000plagio.



On one side of the coin is a representation of a sheaf of wheat, and on the other, Ishtar, the goddess of fertility. The Sumerians called it the "Shekel" where "She" meant wheat, "Kel" [12086] was a measurement similar to a bushel, hence this coin was a symbol of a value of one bushel of wheat. (The word "shekel" survives in modern Hebrew as Israel's monetary unit.) The original shekel had as its purpose payment for sacred prostitution at the temple of Ishtar, which was the temple of life and death. The temple, as well as being a ritual center, was the storage place for the reserves of wheat that supported the priesthood, and also the community in lean times. So farmers fulfilled their religious and social obligations by bringing their contributions of wheat to the temple, and receiving in exchange a shekel coin, entitling them to a visit with the temple prostitutes at the festival time. All this also must be understood in its cultural context: The sacred prostitutes were representatives of the goddess, and intercourse with them was intercourse with the goddess of fertility herself, nothing to take lightly..." The Future of Money, Bernard Lietaer '1997 .. "...coinage was arranged according to the sexagesimal numbering system developed earlier by the Sumerians (ie 1, 60 [1x60], and 3600 [122B9 (60x60]) ....lowest denomination was a “shekel”, then a “mina” [1223E] and finally a “talent” [12118] 1 mina = 60 shekels. 1 talent = 60 mina [3600 shekels]. The mina weighted about 500 gms., and the talent about 30 kgs. These coins were used to pay for property, buy goods and services, pay fines, pay taxes, etc. Some examples of the use of the shekel from one of the later law codes inscribed on the cuneiform tablets: “The price of one gur [12125] of barley is one shekel of silver’. “The price of 2 gurs of salt is one shekel of silver”. “The price of one hal [1212C] seed is one shekel of silver”. “The wage of a labourer is one shekel of silver and his food one ban of barley and he has to serve for this wage for one month”... some information on the relative value of the coins and the wealth that each represented. The scribe is lauding the benevolent king for his protection of the poor. “He saw to it that ... the man of one shekel did not fall a prey to the man of one mina (sixty shekels) ..." [more] ..

Sumerians – Kings of the Earthlings
Firstly, the issue over the more correct cuneiform. Clearly, it make much more sense that 'gi' 12100 reed stylus (writing => knowledge => power; reed marsh of Tigris and Euphrates delta) should be the one we use. Rather than the much less used non-Sumerian, later Babylonian 'gir15' 120A0 (local), as shown at PSD for the individual logogram, 4900x to 7x, and the compound for Sumerian language 'eme.gi' 21x over 'eme.gir15' only 1x, in the older period.
And similarly for tablets refering to the King of Sumer, mainly use 'ki.en.gi', rather than ki.en.gir15 e.g. the famous Ur-Nammu tablet (see below, also ETCSL, e.g.1: Poem Išme-Dagan (c.2.5.4.01), line c25401.A.364; e.g.2: "Then the Martu peoples, who know no agriculture, arose in all Sumer...", c1822.369). So why do the elites misquote the cuneiform sign actually used?!
Also see Proto Language Monosyllables – Patrick Ryan clearly knows what he is talking about, "...Emegi, the language of males in Sumer, differs in some interesting ways from equivalent forms in Emesal, the language of females..."
[12174 'eme' = tongue, language + 12100 GI reed / write]
One can imagine that the Sumerians were dominant and respected by other states because they could write, hence the emphasis on reed stylus. Thus they were looked on as, "Kings of the Earthlings because the stylus is mightier than the sword".

* There are some who say that when the Sumerians call themselves black it should not be taken literally, and black means local or something. Also in signs for other professions the scribes don't add this extra point, but here they emphasize the first professors that started the education revolution 5000 years ago are BLACK!

3-8. "Like you, I was once a youth and had a mentor.
The teacher assigned a task to me -- it was man's work.
Like a springing reed, I leapt up and put myself to work.
I did not depart from my teacher's instructions, and I did not start doing things on my own initiative.
My mentor was delighted with my work on the assignment.
He rejoiced that I was humble before him and he spoke in my favour."

9-15. 9. "I just did whatever he outlined for me -- everything was always in its place. 10. Only a fool would have deviated from his instructions.
11. He guided my hand on the clay and kept me on the right path.
12. He made me eloquent with words and gave me advice.
13. He focused my eyes on the rules which guide a man with a task: 14. zeal is proper for a task, time-wasting is taboo; 15. anyone who wastes time on his task is neglecting his task."

21-26. "And another thing: you will never return to your blinkered vision; that would be greatly to demean due deference, the decency of mankind.
Worthy plants [offerings?] calm the heart, and sins are absolved.
An empty-handed man's gifts are respected as such.
Even a poor man clutches a kid to his chest as he kneels.

29-35. The learned scribe humbly answered his supervisor:
"I shall give you a response to what you have just recited like a magic spell, and a rebuttal to your charming ditty delivered in a bellow.
Do not make me out to be an ignoramus -- I will answer you once and for all! You opened my eyes like a puppy's and you made me into a human being.
But why do you go on outlining rules for me as if I were a shirker?
Anyone hearing your words would feel insulted!"

36-41. "Whatever you revealed of the scribal art has been repaid to you.
You put me in charge of your household and I have never served you by shirking.
I have assigned duties to the slave girls, slaves and subordinates in your household.
I have kept them happy with rations, clothing and oil rations, and I have assigned the order of their duties to them, so that you do not have to follow the slaves around in the house of their master.
I do this as soon as I wake up, and I chivvy them around like sheep."

43] I have made the sheep and banquets attractive, so that your god is overjoyed.
44] When the boat of your god arrives, people should greet it with respect.
45] When you have ordered me to the edge of the fields, I have made the men work there.
It is challenging work which permits no sleep either at night or in the heat of day, if the cultivators are to do their best at the field-borders.
I have restored quality to your fields, so people admire you.
Whatever your task for the oxen, I have exceeded it and have fully completed their loads for you."

Without speaking grandly -- as is your shortcoming -- I serve before you.
But those who undervalue themselves are ignored by you -know that I want to make this clear to you."

62-72. "Nisaba has placed in your hand the honour of being a teacher. {For her, the fate determined for you will be changed and so you will be generously blessed} {(1 ms. has instead:)
You were created by Nisaba! May you ... upwards}. May she bless you with a joyous heart and free you from all despondency. ... at whatever is in the school, the place of learning.

Oldest written erotica
4-Way Inana | 4-Way top | TOC2
Ecology of the Erotic in a Myth of Inanna Judy Grahn Inanna went into the mountains and began flying around. From one border of the territory to the other, she flew round and round. She flew around the Tree whose roots intertwine with the horizon of heaven, by now so tired that she lay down beside its boundary roots. She had in her loincloth a weaving of the seven cosmic powers, across her thighs. Her thoughts were with her shepherd lover, Dumuzid. On the same plot of land a youth, Šukaletuda, was working, and saw her; he approached, untied the loincloth of divine powers...

"Inana needed to pass through the seven gates of the 'abzu' (abyss), and was not allowed to pass through unless she removed an article of clothing / jewelry for each of gate. Her clothes were symbolic of her divine power, thus she was systematically weakened in this fashion. By the time she arrived in the inner palace, she was almost naked and almost dead..." [more]

Some well funded universities like Oxford's Oriental Institute ETCSL et al have everything separated, don't give unicodes at all, and for the sign they link off to PSD (University of Pennsylvania) where it is often not clear which is the relevant one. And their translations are superficial, probably computer generated. When you work with the actual cuneiform signs, rather than just impotent readings using our boring English phonetic script, you start to see that the scribes were not just telling a story, but literally painting the scene. When we start going deeper than such misleading translations it becomes very revealing...

As a temple whore or harlot one of Shamhat's several duties would be to have sex in the temple with paying 'Johns' or 'Customers', said funds being 'donated/ to the temple's upkeep. Below, a drawing after a lead votive offering found in a temple showing a 'John' having sex with a naked priestess atop an altar with a special incline to accomodate the act of sex. Inanna / Ishtar [ Eash-tar => Easter fertility goddess] fulfilled many roles, she was the 'Courtesan of Heaven' ('polite' scholarly language for a whore or prostitute) and wives beseeched her aid in becoming pregnant.
"... figurines depicting intercourse, the man stands and the woman always rests upon a high structure, usually interpreted as an altar. These figurines may very likely represent ritual intercourse...they are probably in some way associated with the cult of Inana / Ishtar as goddess of physical love and prostitution, and were, in fact found in her temple at Asshur..." [Black & Green]
... Adam and Eve in the Garden in Eden [a straight lifting from the Sumerians see 12094 – the original too cool sounding to use an inferior replacement name] being a later recasting of Enkidu and Shamhat ... thus nothing more than a recasting and sanitizing of an earlier 'ribald' Sumerian story about 'Whores and their Johns'

The song of lettuce, t.4.08.05
[4-Way to come]
Vigorously he sprouted, vigorously he sprouted and sprouted, water it - it being lettuce! In his black garden of the desert bearing much yield did my darling of his mother, My barley stalk full of allure in its furrow, water it - it being lettuce, Did my one - a very apple tree bearing fruit at the top – water it - it being a garden! The honey-sweet man, the honey-sweet man, was doing sweet (things) to me! My lord, the honey-sweet man, the godly one, my darling of his mother, His hands honey sweet, his feet honeying, was doing sweet (things) to me! His limbs being sweet his feet honeying, was doing sweet (things) to me! His limbs being sweet, sweet honey, he was doing sweet things to me!
O my one who of a sudden was doing sweet (things) to the whole (insides up) to the navel, my darling of his mother, My desert-honey loins, darling of his mother, you watered it - it being lettuce!
The lettuce, mentioned in these texts (hi-izsar [1212D]) is probably Lactuta sativa... In Sumerian texts it is generally associated with cunt.. Jacobson thought it represented the pubic hair. Maybe the visual aspect is less important here, although the overlapping leaves and their texture, as well as milky or clear sap, are quite evocative, lettuces and similar fast growing vegetables, like cucumbers and melons, all of which were grown in Mesopotamian gardens, require frequent watering ... association with water might also have contributed to the metaphorical range: the cunt, like lettuce, is said to need the 'watering' ...
We have seen that làl ('honey') is frequently used to describe sensual pleasure. The expression 'to taste the honey-plant' was a common euphemism for intercourse. Here the lover is equated with the sensation he brings - his very limbs are 'honey', they 'bring sweetness', orgasmic enjoyment. The metaphor extends from activity ('to do the sweet thing [same sign 1212D HI]') and personal attributes ('whose limbs are honey') to the location... This 'honey' was date-syrup rather than the bees' product.
..
A balbale to Inana, t.4.08.4, alternative translation Alster 1993:
The brother makes me enter his house: He made me lie on a honey-smelling bed, After my precious, dear one, had lain by my heard, One-by-one, making "tongues", one by one, My brother of the fairest face made fifty. He became (?) like a silenced man With an 'earthquake' he was put to silence. My brother, with a hand put on his waist, My precious, sweet one, the time passes! (Lover:) Se me free, my sister, set me free! Come, my beloved sister, let us go to the palace (var. to our house)! May you be a little daughter in my father's eyes!"
Leick gives the Sumerian of one of the lines in part because of its 'delightful resonances':
dili-dili-ta eme-ak dili-dili-ta One by one - making tongues - one by one
'eme-ak' (tongue making) usually implies speaking, chatting (the proverbial 'sweet nothings'?). But it could also have, as Alster duly noted, a double meaning, and imply lovemaking. The following lines speak in favor of a sexual meaning, as the 'brother' is silenced by an 'earthquake' - surely a reference to an orgasm - although Inanna is willing to continue this form of passing time. Again the scenario is one of pre-martial love making, with the man expressing his desire to formulate their sexual union, since the last line explicitly says that a girl should become a daughter-in-law to his father. The text is imbued with a sense of irony, that the inexperienced ki-sikil is well able to exhaust the ardour of her lover, even rather overtaking his virility."



cf. Oath of Women (A balbale to Inana Dumuzid B) t.4.08.02
My juicy, grape, my honey sweet... May you put your right hand in my cunt, With your left stroke my head, When you have brought your mouth close to my mouth, When you have taken my lips in your mouth, By so doing you wil swear an oath to me...
etcsl.orinst.oxc40802.21
21-26. You are to place your right hand on my cunt while your left hand rests on my head, bringing your mouth close to my mouth, and taking my lips in your mouth: thus you shall take an oath for me. This is the oath of women

Gudea Cylinders
4-Way Ninĝirsu's Temple | 4-Way top | TOC2
The Gudea cylinders are a pair of terracotta cylinders dating to circa 7875 CT [2125 plag] on which is written in cuneiform a Sumerian myth called the Building of Ningursu's temple.[1] The cylinders were found in '1877 during excavations at Telloh (ancient Girsu), Iraq and are now displayed in the Louvre in Paris, France. They are the largest cuneiform cylinders yet discovered and contain the longest known text written in the Sumerian language... [Wik]
The god of wisdom, Enki, organized the world after creation and gave each deity a role in the world order. Nisaba was named the scribe of the gods, and Enki then built her a school of learning so that she could better serve those in need.
Nidaba / Nindaba / Nisaba = goddess of writing (and teaching) she was often praised by Sumerian scribes.
Many clay-tablets end with the phrase DINGIR.NAGA.ZAG.SAL, dnisaba za3-mi2, “Nisaba be praised” to honor the goddess. She is considered the teacher of both mortal scribes and other divine deities...
As the goddess of knowledge, she is related to many other facets of intellectual study and other gods may turn to her for advice or aid. Some of these traits are shared with her sister Ninsina. She is also associate with grain, reflecting her association with an earth goddess mother.
12240 NAGA = potash; soap
AN.NAGA is read as NANIBGAL, and AN.ŠE.NAGA as NÁNIBGAL. NAGA is read as NÍDABA or NÍSABA, and ŠE.NAGA as
NIDABA or NISABA...[Wik]

Sumer Periods
Ubaid = 5000-6000CT (5000-4000 religio-plagio) – Early settlements in Sumer (southern Iraq).
Uruk = 6000-7000CT (4000-3000 plag) – Civilization devlops rapidly through cuneiform writing.
Early Dynastic = 7000-7650CT (3000-2350 plag) – Independent, sometimes conflicting Sumerian city states. [Literature of Ancient Sumer, Jeremy Black]
ED IIIa = The Early Dynastic IIIa (Fara) period - c.7400-7500CT (2600-2500 plag)
ED IIIb period = c. 7460-7650CT (2540-2350 plag)
The Early Dynastic period began after a cultural break with the preceding Jemdet Nasr period that has been radio-carbon dated to about [7100CT (2900 plag)] at the beginning of the Early Dynastic I Period. No inscriptions have yet been found verifying any names of kings that can be associated with the Early Dynastic I period. The ED I period is distinguished from the ED II period by the narrow cylinder seals of the ED I period and the broader wider ED II seals engraved with banquet scenes or animal-contest scenes. The Early Dynastic II period is when Gilgamesh, the famous king of Uruk, is believed to have reigned. Later inscriptions have been found bearing some Early Dynastic II names from the King List. The Early Dynastic IIIa period is when syllabic writing began. Accounting records and an undeciphered logographic script existed before the Fara Period, but the full flow of human speech was first recorded around [7400CT (2600plag)] at the beginning of the Fara Period.
Hegemony, which came to be conferred by the Nippur priesthood, alternated among a number of competing dynasties, hailing from Sumerian city-states traditionally including Kish, Uruk, Ur, Adab and Akshak, as well as some from outside of southern Mesopotamia, such as Awan, Hamazi, and Mari, until the Akkadians, under Sargon of Akkad, overtook the area...
Ur III = The Third Dynasty of Ur: 107 years, 7954-8061CT (2047–1940 plag) [cf. 108 years, 7888-7996CT (2112–2004 plag) - Black, ibid.]
Also known as the Neo-Sumerian Empire or the Ur III Empire, refers to a Sumerian ruling dynasty based in the city of Ur and a short-lived territorial-political state that some historians regard as a nascent empire... [Wik]
The Third Dynasty of Ur came to preeminent power in Mesopotamia after several centuries of Akkadian and Gutian kings. It controlled the cities of Isin, Larsa and Eshnunna and extended as far north as the Jazira.
The Third Dynasty of Ur arose some time after the fall of the Akkad Dynasty. The period between the last powerful king of the Akkad Dynasty, Shar-kali-sharri, and the first king of Ur III, UrNammu, is not well documented, but most Assyriologists posit that there was a brief "dark age", followed by a power struggle among the most powerful city-states...

Anyway, once you get the hang of it, you can see Steve Tinney has still done a terrific job. Below is a quick guide – mainly use the "S" (Sign-names) column for lemmas:
..



PSD: Search Help
The ePSD search is intended to be a DWIM (Do What I Mean) interface--in general you can type any kind of ePSD key term in this box and see what happens. This means citation forms, transliteration, English words... You can also enter a fuzzy CFGW pair here in which the GW part does not need to be a literal GW, but can be any key word from the actual GW or meanings entries of the article, e.g., sag[good].
[Note: for ePSD input 'saj' to get saĝ; uc2 ~ uš2 ]
Two wildcards are available for fuzzier searches. The asterisk wildcard, *, matches any string and can be used to select multiple keys, e.g., ban* selects ban, ban2, ... banda... etc. It can be used anywhere in the term, and may be used more than once.
A special-purpose wildcard is provided by the percent sign, %. This matches any numbers at the end of a key; use this when you want to match all graphemes with the same basename,
e.g., kici% selects kici13, kici14 etc.
Aliasing or fuzzy key matching is enabled by default for graphemic searches. In this mode, a search term selects not only the grapheme itself, but also those which the aliases table (which you can read here) considers to be equivalent; in other words the kici% search above also selects kic because the aliases table considers kic andkici to be equivalent. To suppress aliasing use double-quotes ("kic%" doesn't select the kici values).
Anchors can be used to force the text to match the beginning or end of a field. The two anchors are the same as in various regular expression languages: ^ (carat) to anchor to the start-ofline; $ (dollar) to anchor to end-of-line.
Grapheme delimiters of various kinds are provided. To find only signs joined by hyphens in the transliteration, use a hyphen, e.g., gu2-e3. To find only signs separated by a space, you must use the underline character, e.g.,gu2_e3 (space characters between signs default to meaning boolean 'with' as described in the section on boolean operators). To find signs which may have either space or hyphen between them, use the tilde, gu2~e3.
Field restrictors are provided to restrict the scope of a search to parts of an ePSD article. Field restrictors consist of a field-code followed by a colon, and must be attached directly to the key. To restrict searches only to citation forms, for example, use c:ba; to restrict to transliteration, use t:ba. The field-codes are the same as the TOC Matrix codes, but are given in lower case.
Boolean operators are provided. You can search for keys that co-occur in a record, even when they are different field types. The and operator requires the right-hand term to follow the left-hand term within the same field; ab and ba selects records only when ba comes somewhere after ab. Spaces between search terms are automatically taken as and operators by the search engine, so you can often simply write, e.g., ba ab.
The with operator selects records whenever the two terms co-occur, so ab with ba selects all the records where ab and ba both occur but in any order. Because it cannot make sense to consider the order within a field when the left- and right-hand terms come from different fields, the search engine automatically converts and towith if the and-operation produces zero results and the fields of the two operands are different.



The or operator selects records containing either the left-hand or the right-hand term, e.g., e3 or
e11.
Determinatives can be searched for by putting them in curly brackets as in the CDLI conventions, e.g.,{gic}gu-za. The search engine is designed to find words regardless of the way determinatives occur in the indexed data: {gic}gu-za finds {gic}gu-za and gic-gu-za. In addition, determinatives are ignored when searching so that, for example, za~en finds za {d}en

Sumerian transliteration search
To search, enter a search string, e.g. 'dub-sar' or 'en &d;gilgamec2', and click the Search for button.
Whenever possible, choose lemma instead of form from the drop-down menu, and enter a search string, e.g. 'a dug4'. This will ensure that you find all the occurrences of the lexeme.
When searching use:
c for the letter shin (s with caron = š)
for nasal g (g with tilde/circumflex = g/ĝ)
h for the letter h with breve below (ḫ)
English label search
To search using English, choose label, and not form, from the drop-down menu above, enter a search string, e.g. 'scribe' or 'lord Gilgamec', and click the Search for button.
Remember to enclose multiword labels in double quotation marks, i.e. enter '"type of priestess"' and not 'type of priestess', or use the truncation symbol %, i.e. enter '%priestess'. This applies to verbs as well, i.e. to find a verb, enter either '"to break"' or '%break'.
The English labels are basic translations (glosses), and do not reflect the full meaning potential of the Sumerian lexeme in every context.
Note that the way the search results are displayed is the same, no matter how you search. It is always in the form of a KWIC (Key-Word-In-Context) concordance. For more help on searching, go to ETCSLhelp.
If you have display problems, please choose the 'j' Char. enc. option.
The Display options are 'Crit' (default) and 'Plain', signifying display with critical apparatus, following the conventions of the web site, or display without critical apparatus.
More search tips:
Determinatives are encoded as entities, e.g. &d;, &jic; or &ku6;, and must be entered as such when included in search strings. A list of determinatives can be found below.



Note the differences between searching for 'dub-sar', '%dub-sar', 'dub-sar%' and '%dub-sar%'. '%' is the truncation symbol.
Note also that '-' (hyphen) is significant when searching, so that searching for '%-dub-sar' will give a very different result from searching for '%dub-sar'.
Avoid searching for parts of speech (pos) only.
To distinguish between lower and upper case forms, the following conventions can be used:
1. 'na' finds all occurrences of upper and lower case 'na/NA'
2. 'NA' finds all occurrences of upper case 'NA'
3. 'na\B' finds all occurrences of lower case 'na'
Searching can be further refined by combining lemma, part of speech, type and/or label:
1. 'lem=kar pos=N' finds all occurrences of lemma 'kar' where it is a noun
2. 'lem=urud' typ=DN' finds all occurrences of 'urud' as a divine name
3. 'lem=ur5 lab=liver' finds all occurrences of lemma 'ur5' where it has the label 'liver'
4. 'lab=lady lem!=nin' finds all occurrences of label 'lady' where lemma is not 'nin'
The following categories (attributes) can be combined to limit a search in this way:
lem(ma), pos, lab(el), for(m) and typ(e) (or use abbrev. l, p, a, f, t).

Encoding and text conventions
Encoding
The default character encoding for the second edition of the ETCSL is Unicode. If your browser cannot display Unicode characters, choose the non-Unicode (Ascii) version of the catalogues and when searching. Unicode is supported by all recent versions of the most popular web browsers. The default Unicode font is Arial Unicode MS.
Transliteration conventions
Diacritics which are sometimes transcribed as acute and grave accents over the vowel (á, é, í, ú and à, è, ì, ù) to show a value of a sign are here marked with subscript 2 and 3 respectively. So you will find zu2 not zú and dug3 not dùg.
When display is set to Ascii (non-Unicode), the following conventions are used to mark non-ASCII characters in transliterations of Sumerian: c represents the letter shin (s with caron = š) and C the corresponding capital letter



represents nasal g (g with circumflex or tilde = ĝ or g) and J the corresponding capital letter h represents h with breve below (= ḫ) and H the corresponding capital letter
In non-Sumerian contexts, e.g. in the translations and in English titles and notes, a set of character entities have been used to render non-Roman Sumerian and Akkadian letters. The most frequent entities are &c; for shin, &g; for nasal g, and &h; for h with breve below.
In Akkadian glosses, any diacritic will disappear in non-Unicode view, i.e. long a (ā) will become a, sadhe (ṣ) will become s, etc.
Line numbers are shown at the beginning of each line of composite text. Where a composition is extant in discontiguous segments, those segments are lettered, and the line numbering starts again at 1. Line numbers also appear at the beginning of every paragraph of English prose translation, marking the corresponding lines of composite text. For instance, 37-45 would mark the start of the paragraph which translates lines 37 to 45 of the composite text. Line markers also serve as links between the corresponding parts of the composite text and translation.
Translation conventions
All translations are in continuous English prose, in complete sentences as far as possible. The translations are divided into paragraphs for ease of reading.
Damaged, missing or untranslatable passages from one to several words in length are indicated by the mark ...... (i.e. two ellipses). Damaged, missing or untranslatable whole lines or passages are indicated as follows: (1 line damaged/missing/unclear) (32 lines damaged etc.) (unknown no. of lines missing).
Individual words of which the translation is uncertain are followed by the mark (?). Sumerian words and names are systematically normalised in translation (e.g. Inana, Meš-Ane-pada).



Critical apparatus and display conventions
X indicates a fragmentary unreadable sign ! follows a corrected sign ? follows a queried sign [ ] delimit missing, but supplied text [X] indicate one sign missing [...] indicate more than two signs missing / \ delimit partially damaged text { } enclose textual variants < > delimit corrected scribal omissions « » delimit corrected scribal additions (note) English notes are in italics and delimited by brackets (source: RU)
means the source has 'RU'; i.e., it is a note following a reading of a sign, as in 'im-ma-an-pad3(source: RU)'
tum9u18-lu determinatives, e.g. &tum9;, are in superscript
Glosses Sumerian are in superscript
Akgloss Akk. are in italics
Emesal Emesal text is in purple Proper Proper nouns are in green

LAK (proto list)
(Liste der archaischen Keilschriftzeichen 1922 WVDOG 40, Berlin)
http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/tools/SignLists/LAK/HTML/P0001.html
(UCLA Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative)
LAK is a dictionary of Sumerian cuneiform signs of the pre-classical Fara period (Early Dynastic II), published in '1922 by Sumerologist P. Anton Deimel ('1865–'1954). The list enumerates 870 distinct cuneiform signs.
The sign inventory in the archaic period was considerably larger than the standard inventory of texts of the classical Sumerian (7400-7650CT [2600-2350plag]) or Neo-Sumerian (7900CT; all dates short chronology) periods. This means that numerous signs identified by their classical reading continue several distinct signs of the pre-classical period. If it is necessary to identify the pre-classical sign intended, its LAK number is customarily given, in the form of LAK-1 to LAK870 [Wik] :

[740x] = number of times attested – as noted by ePSD – it's important to note that a number of the signs (esp the hundreds of repetitive variants) in the standard lists were rarely used.
[~ xxx!] = very large number e.g. 121A0 KI (gi5) [32379xxx!] = cosmic world...

gunû and šeššig
One method of generating new signs was to mark a portion of a base sign to specify the object intended. The marks are called by the scribes either gunû-strokes (from Sumerian gùn-a 'colored, decorated') or šeššig- hatchings (due to the resemblance of the strokes to the early cross-hatched form of the Sumerian sign for grain, še). Compare the following two sets of signs:
In the first set, the base sign is saĝ 'head'. Strokes over the mouth portion produces SAĜ-gunû, to be read ka 'mouth'. In the second set, the base sign is da 'side' (i.e., a shoulder, arm and hand). Hatchings over the arm portion produces DA-šeššig, to be read á 'arm'... [Foxvog]

Pronunciation
Vowels may be pronounced as follows: a - as in father, e - as in peg, i - as in hip, u - as in pull.
Of the special consonants,
ñ is pronounced like 'ng' in rang, so saĝ would be sang,
þ is pronounced like 'ch' in German Buch (bookkk) or Scottish loch (lookkk, not lock! ['x (ḫ)' hbreve plain velar fricative cf. (voiceless) velar fricative /ḫ/ (sometimes ust written h); Anatolian ḫ]) – tongue slightly to roof of mouth and breathe through /out, throaty sound, like something stuck in
throat, bringing up phlegm] and š is pronounced like 'sh' in dash.
..
a, e4: n., water; watercourse, canal; seminal fluid; offspring; father; tears; flood.
é: house, household; temple; plot of land.
i: n., cry of pain (derived from ér, ír, 'tears; complaint' ?).
v., to capture, defeat, overcome (cf., éd, è; i, 'to sprout')
ú: n., plant; vegetable; grass; food; bread; pasture; load.
v., to nourish, support.
adj., strong, powerful (man).
ù: n., sleep (cf., u5). [according to S. Lieberman, u, ù, and u4 were pronounced /o/]
v., to sleep.
u(3,4,8): n., an expression of protest; cries, screams; the grunting, panting.
v., to bend over.
u5: n., male bird, cock; totality; earth pile or levee; raised area (sometimes written ù).
v., to mount (coition); to be on top of; to ride; to steer, conduct.
adj., (raised) high, especially land or ground (sometimes written ù).

We do not know how Sumerian was spoken. Scribes were trained for over two years to become competent in Sumerian, the basis of the cuneiform writing system. The Sumerian cuneiform writing system consists of around 700 signs, which could represent both words and syllables. We must learn the language as well as the way it was written. Cuneiform is full of mysteries; it became increasingly complex over the three thousand years of its development, and its adepts utilized these complexities for esoteric teaching and speculation. While we cannot hope to duplicate the training or the native knowledge of the scribes, we must try in some way to make their teaching our own. We must begin by saying what they said, pronouncing what they pronounced. Although we cannot be certain how the languages were spoken, there are three ways to reconstruct pronunciation:
1. Comparing contemporary descended or related languages
2. Ancient transliterations or phonological discussions from the unknown to a known language
3. Borrowings from the unknown to a known language
Sumerian has no known descendants or relatives, so we must rely entirely on point number 2. Sumerian was written with the same set of characters, and for 2000 years... We work from the pronunciation of Akkadian back to the Sumerian. Finally, we are fairly confident of the quality of Sumerian vowels - whether it is an a, e, i, u (even perhaps o) - we have very little idea of the quantity - long or short, high or low, etc.
The following guide to Sumerian is therefore purely practical:
a short as in "bat," or long as in "father"
â long as in "father"
b as in "babble"
d as in English
e short as in "bet"
e sometimes long as in "day"
g hard as in English "gag"
ĝ nasal "ng" as in "thing"
ḫ rough [throaty] "h", no English equivalent
i short as in "sit"
i sometimes long as in "ski"
k always hard as in "kick"
l as in English
m same as English



n same as English
p same as English
r same as English, can be flat or rolled
s same as English
š like "sh" in "ship"
t as in English
u short as in "cut"
u sometimes long as in "ruby"
z as in English
There are two diphthongs:
"ia" pronounced "ee-yah" or "ya"
"ai" pronounced "ah-ee" or like the word "aye"
If any other two vowels come together, pronounce them like they are both the first vowel.

The tables above show signs used for simple syllables of the form CV or VC. As used for the Sumerian language, the cuneiform script was in principle capable of distinguishing at least 16 consonants, transliterated as
b, d, g, g, ḫ, k, l, m, n, p, r, ř, s, š, t, z
as well as four vowel qualities: a, e, i, u. ...[Wik]
..
The picture of a hand came to stand not only for Sumerian šu (“hand”) but also for the phonetic syllable šu in any required context. Sumerian words were largely monosyllabic, so the signs generally denoted syllables, and the resulting mixture is termed a word-syllabic script. The inventory of phonetic symbols henceforth enabled the Sumerians to denote grammatical elements by phonetic complements added to the word signs (logograms or ideograms). Because Sumerian had many identical sounding (homophonous) words, several logograms frequently yielded identical phonetic values and are distinguished in modern transliteration—(as, for example, ba, bá, bà, ba4). Because a logogram often represented several related notions with different names (e.g., “sun,” “day,” “bright”), it was capable of assuming more than one phonetic value (this feature is called polyphony)...more

...'accents' and subscript numerals do not affect the pronunciation – Halloran

Foxvog's Basics
http://home.comcast.net/~foxvog/Grammar.pdf]
Sign Diacritics and Index Numbers
Sumerian features a large number of homonyms — words that were pronounced
similarly but had different meanings and were written with different signs,
for example:
/du/ 'to come, go' 1207A
/du/ 'to build' 12195
/du/ 'to release' 12083
A system of numerical subscripts, and diacritics over vowels representing
subscripts, serves to identify precisely which sign appears in the actual text Borger's index system which is used here is as follows:
Single-syllable signs Multiple-syllable signs
du (= du1) muru
dú (= du2) múru
dù (= du3) mùru
du4 etc. muru4
Note that the diacritic always falls on the first vowel of the word!
There is variation in the systems employed in older signlists for multiple- syllable signs, especially in Labat. In the earliest editions of his sign-list which may still be encountered in libraries, Labat carried the use of diacritics through index numbers 4-5 by shifting the acute and grave accents onto the first syllable of multiple-syllable signs:
murú (= muru2)
murù (= muru3)
múru (= muru4)
mùru (= muru5)



New values of signs, pronunciations for which no generally accepted index numbers yet exist, are given an "x" subscript, e.g. dax 'side'...
Many signs are polyvalent, that is, they have more than one value or reading...
...
Polyvalency
The most important new development by far was the principle of polyvalency, the association of "many values" with a particular sign, each with its own separate pronunciation. This became a very productive and simple method of generating new logographic values.
Determinatives
To help the reader decide which possible value of a polyvalent sign was intended by the writer, the use of determinatives arose. A determinative is one of a limited number of signs which, when placed before or after a sign or group of signs, indicates that the determined object belongs to a particular semantic category, e.g. wooden, reed, copper or bronze objects, or persons, deities, places, etc. Determinatives were still basically optional as late as the Ur III period (7887-7997CT). When Sumerian died as a spoken language, they became obligatory. Determinatives were presumably not to be pronounced when a text was read, and to show that they are not actually part of a word we transliterate them, in unilingual Sumerian context at least, as superscripts. To use the example of the 'plow' sign above, the polyvalent sign APIN [see 12033] is read
APIN - if preceded by a 'wood' determinative: GIŠAPIN 'plow'
ENGAR - if preceded by a 'person' determinative: LÚENGAR 'plowman'
but URU4 'to plow' or ÀBSIN 'furrow' elsewhere, depending upon context.
Rebus Writing and Syllabic Values
At some point rebus [cf. Kindle defi: a puzzle – words are rep by combo pictures and individua; letters e.g. apex = picture of ape + letter X shown by] writings arose, where the sign for an object which could easily be drawn was used to write a homophonous word which could not so easily be depicted, especially an abstract idea. For example, the picture of an arrow, pronounced /ti/, became also the standard sign for ti 'rib' as well as for the verb ti(l) 'to live'. The adoption of the rebus principle was a great innova- tion, but it adds to the difficulty of learning the Sumerian writing system, since meanings of words thus written are divorced entirely from the original basic shapes and meanings of their signs.
...The Sumero-Akkadian writing system was still in limited use as late as the [100th] century.; the last known texts are astronomical in nature and can be dated to ca. [10076CT]. The system thus served the needs of Mesopotamian civilizations for a continuous span of over 3200 years – a remarkable achievement in human history.
Syllabic Signs
Used in Sumerian primarily to write grammatical elements. They are also commonly used to write words for which there is no proper logogram. Sometimes this phonetic writing is a clue that the word in question is a foreign loanword.



Determinatives
Logograms which may appear before or after words which categorize the latter in a variety of ways. They are orthographic aids and were presumably not pronounced in actual speech. They begin to be used spora- dically by the end of the archaic period. While they were probably developed to help a reader chose the desired value of a polyvalent sign, they are often employed obligatorily even when the determined logogram is not polyvalent. For example, while the wood determinative ĝiš may be used before the PA sign to help specify its reading ĝidri 'scepter', rather than, e.g., sìg 'to beat', ĝiš is also used before hašhur 'apple (tree or wood)' even though this sign has no other reading. Other common functions are to help the reader distinguish between homonymous words, e.g. ad 'sound' and gišAD 'plank' or between different related meanings of a word, e.g. nú 'to sleep' but gišĝèšnu (NÚ) 'bed'. The following determinatives are placed BEFORE the words they determine and so are referred to as pre-determinatives:
The following determinatives are placed AFTER the words they determine and so are referred to as post-determinatives:

To All Australian / International Schools / Universities
Home School / University Tender
Dear Principal / Chancellor
What a package. By becoming the home school / university you instantly gain international prestige with the ultimate and world first Faculty of True Origins cutting across cultural barriers attracting students from all over the planet. It would kickstart with courses based around these heavyweights, all from the same authorship, being bundled into the deal is:
Sumerian Cuneiform English Dictionary (MUGSAR) – Ongoing maintenance and development of the niftiest in the university world. Who or what can beat it, the first written language, indeed the very first professors and students. Clearly shows up Oxford University Faculty of Oriental Studies (ETCSL) and others.
Civilization Time – An unequivocal sign that your university does not support discrimination and is open to students from all cultures. Adoption and promotion of the legitimate, non-religio year dating system.
Billjim (/Anzac) Centenary 2014 – 2018 – A fair dinkum demonstrable affinity. Billjim Centenary
Theme Song and Exploits of the Billjim production. Less emphasis on war and fought who and more on the cross-cultural music and the Waler (horse bred in NSWales). Music and video production is cool for any student. Local parents want to see that you are doing something special. Overseas parents can relate to the apotheosis of mateship and the special horse component.
The Hyphen, The Mask & The Daughter – Susan de Vere, Shakespeare's daughter, producer of the First Folio, the 400th anniversary in 2023 beckons.
In return, simply want to work with the school / university, in Australia or wherever, to set up the courses and for Tara (b. 2002) to follow.
Sincerely

THE D.A.P. SCORE - The Impostor Exposor Calculator
D x A x P = score
We have all these famous people. But how can we be sure they deserve the credit. “History is full of dead white males”. Often privileged with lots of family money and connections, one’s father was even ‘god’. The ones that weren’t so privileged were supposed to be natural geniuses – but a closer look shows that there is very little concrete historical evidence to support what they have supposed to have done – myth becomes fact, history rewritten. There really is no need to separate a Library into Fiction and Non-Fiction – it’s all Fiction. All this spinmeistering is to suit some group’s purpose, and usually becomes an established powerful money making industry, including Will Extortion of the gullible elderly, the "Tickets to Heaven" con job – leaving future generations dispossessed and invariably lined up at Centrelink.
The “D.A.P. Score” is a formula for ranking people – an imposter exposer calculator, if you like. It is designed to weed out famous, influential people who have had a lot of help, to say the least. Each of the 3 variables has a maximum score of 10. So the total maximum score is 1000.
You can calculate the DAP score for anybody, yourself or some famous figure.
“D” = Degree of DIFFICULTY – in getting started / growing up, e.g. born into a 3rd world or advanced nation, poor or affluent family, well-grounded/stable or dysfunctional upbringing – alcoholic or caring parents, etc. So a very difficult start would score near 10, a very easy start, lots of assistance from family, connections, stable advanced economy would score near 0. Remember that if “D” is low or zero, there’s not much point in continuing further and analyzing the next variables “A” and “P” – because even if they are maximums you still end up with zilch: 0 x 10 x 10 = 0
“A” = Degree of ACHIEVEMENT based on “D” (the degree of difficulty in getting started).
“P” = Degree of POTENTIAL, essentially for ‘immortality’.
Thus, in summary, DAP = D x A x P
The maximum is 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000
Let’s now look at some examples:
* William Shakspere
William Shakspere (seems to have been spelt lots of different ways – we only have 6 dubious signatures - no letters or manuscripts, because he was likely illiterate) - held out to be William Shakespeare,the playwright, by the multi-billion dollar Stratford industry. Degree of Difficulty pretty average, didn’t achieve anything above the ordinary, but has a strong potential for immortality. Yep, the Establishment has credited him with the achievements of Edward de Vere. Just shows you if they can get away with re-writing history in this case, what else do they teach our children that has no sound foundation in a little thing called ‘reality’.
William Shakspere’s – most likely pronounced ‘shack’ or ‘shax’ - de Vere used the name William Shakespeare (it was often hyphenated as an extra clue for the coneys) because of the similarity to the Pallas



Athena goddess of Wisdom motif of shaking the spear at ignorance) and it neatly coincided as part of his coat of arms as Lord Bolbec :
Guillem Shaxper’s DAP score = 10 x 0 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000)
* T.E. Lawrence
Probably blame Lowell Thomas (the American journalist commissioned by the government to get the wary public interested in sending their sons to the slaughter, he started out in the Western front stalemate, then had the bright idea to check out the Middle East campaign – and the first of several allied agents dressed in Arab costume that he saw ... well, he could ust see how it could be marketed). Somewhat ’Difficult’ start – father runs off with maid, takes her name, which really means Lawrence is ‘Chapman’ – finding out he was actually a bastard seems to have effected him; didn’t ’Achieve’ what Hollywood said he did – that was the Australian Light Horse; but he certainly does have the ‘Potential’ for immortality, if there’s an industry making money out of the ‘Myth as historical Fact‘ market.
Ned’s (that’s what his family called him) DAP score = 5 x 0 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000)
* Horus O’Nazareth
One remembers hearing the Spanish pronunciation of “J” for the first time, then it hit me like the Droeshout engraving, a dead give away. A lot of similarities to the way the Shakespeare Myth developed, no wonder they started getting nervous when it started shattering – so they had to fall back on the old faithful “Angra Mainyu ( the original source of the evil one) put the fossils in the layers of sediment to fool the consumer”. They clearly plagiarized a mix of Sumerian, Egyptian, Zoroastrian (confirmed by the Dead Sea Scrolls unearthing in '1956) and Buddhism mythologies. Despite all the detailed, yet spurious writings, written well after his time (generally, many would argue that, “no Paul – Roman CIA Agent to come up with a way to stop the violent freedom fighters, no Horus the ‘turn the other cheek / it’s cool being poor’ Buddhist motif”), there is very little objective evidence of his existence, let alone deeds. In spite of comandeering Civilization’s year counting system, e.g. 2013 AD, that is supposed to be based on his birth year, no-one knows his year of birth, nor the date – December 25, being a rip-off of the sun god’s birthday, the festival of much older cultures, based on the northern hemisphere winter solstice. Yet the hierarchy and associated billion dollar industry hold out the 25th December to be the original factual historical birthday – “It’s written down there somewhere, by someone who was there, heck we have all the other details, of course they jotted down the date too” – next time you chat to someone high up that gets chauffered around, ask them for a page reference. So now the ma ority of the world’s population is lumped with a calendar system based on a (tax exempt) religion - thereby not constitutionally keeping a ‘Separation of (someone else’s) church and State’. And there is strong archaeological evidence (only discovered within the last 160 years) that much of the spiel has been plagiarized from these much older cultures, especially Sumer (Iraq) and Egypt. Like ‘The Gilgamesh Epic’ – the oldest story written on clay tablets – including the original flood story. And of course the Egyptian Horus myth. Actually since Alexandria, Egypt is the true home of the Civilization’s Calendar (including the modern version developed by Sosigenes), and the recent epochal rebirth of Egypt, they should be put back in charge of the Calendar. The new Egypt Democratice government should make it their first submission to the United Nations: for the first time, a true international calendar. A non sectarian one – simply Civilization Time - starting at the true beginning of Civilization at the end of the last ice age that allowed the first villages cum Cities, no longer relegating the great Egypt, Sumer (originally black-headed people probably from East Africa who hoppped across the Arabian Gulf), Indus and China cultures to ancient sounding BC status, - to be used on all international records – 2013 Anno Domini (latin for Year Domination) years since ‘what’ (there’s no historical record of anything happening in 1AD, whoever theirGuillem Shaksper figurehead was based on had to be born



at least by 4BC) of the current religio Western dominated plagiarized calendar to, add the forgotten 10,000 years = 12013CT
Aren’t we supposed to be teaching our children not to Plagiarize someone else’s stuff?
In any event, moving onto the DAP analysis: The “D” score. It seems that he had perfect parents (something few of us have) and a ‘close’ connection to ‘god’ – a pretty useful connection. And it may even be argued, that his success / achievement was pre-destined – all setup, a forgone conclusion. So even before getting to the “A” and “P” scores, the “D” score and therefore the overall DAP is looking pretty close to zero. Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up:
Horus o’N DAP score = 0 x 10 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000)
* Bill Gates
Has the strong potential to be the richest man that will ever live.
His “D” score: born into an advanced nation, affluent family line, and again, given the achievement bug by his grandmother. A closer look at the development of Microsoft shows that it if not for, Paul Allen, Bill Gates would be still trying to graduate from Harvard. It was Allen that first identified the seed of the future Microsoft. And much of the later software, that fueled the exponential development was essentially plagiarized. So again we have a “D” score approaching 0.
Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up:
Bill Gate’s DAP score = 0 x 10 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000)
* Former President Bill Clinton
His “D” score: He was born into an advanced nation, didn’t know his biological father, mother wasn’t around much. But he was essentially raised by his grandmother, who had the time and inclination to give him lots of attention and instill a learning / achievement bug in his brain. His step father, whose name he would later take, was very influential in Arkansas. And many would say Hillary Rodham Clinton was, and is, a key driving force in his success. So, in spite of his rise to the presidency, a major achievement, from seemingly humble beginnings, giving a high, even approaching a maximum “A” score, his “D” on close analysis is appears to be paradoxicallly low. And his “P” score, given the scandals, etc. is probably also very low.
Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up:
Bill Clinton’s DAP Score = 2 x 10 x 1 = 20 ( ust 2% of a maximum 1000)
* Former President George II
Well, I think you can calculate that one.
* Albert Einstein
The “D” score: born into an advanced nation, reasonably affluent family, considerable useful influence came from his uncle, excellent academic environment / facilities, and a first wife that may well have played a greater



role than we will ever know. The “A” and “P” scores are pretty obvious.
Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up:
Albert Einstein’s DAP score = 7 x 10 x 10 = 700 (70% of a maximum 1000)
* James Watson
James Watson along with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins shot to fame, including the ’1962 Nobel Prize for their structure of DNA – the double helix, but they lifted the work of Rosalind Franklin (b. 25 July ’1920).
She was the ultimate loser, dying of cancer at age 38 in ’1958 (talk about bad luck!) never knowing just how much her colleagues ripped her off, because to them she was just a stupid female. The plagiarists basked in their sham glory past their 80s. Refer p563-8 Science – A History, John Gribbin, and the “Rosalind Franklin The Dark Lady of DNA“, Brenda Maddox)
James Watson’s DAP score = 0 x 0 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000)
***
To finish on a positive note:
* Charles ‘Hank’ Bukowski
Bukowski had a shitty start, but stumbled on to John Martin, who himself commands a high DAP score. In a sense the two men are inextricably coupled for eternity.
Bukowski’s DAP score = 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 (100% of a maximum 1000)
* “Billjim“
This one is still being played out.
Billjim DAP score = 10 x 10 x ? = [remains to be seen - are plebs becoming empowered enough with the Internet?]
