THE SURVIVAL
OF
THE PAGAN GODS






Introduction
T
HE TI T LE of the present work requires a certain amount of explanation. As the Middle Ages and the Renaissance come to be better known, the traditional antithesis between them grows less marked. The medieval period appears "less dark and static," and the Renaissance "less bright and less sudden."' Above all, it is now recognized that pagan antiquity, far from experiencing a "rebirth" in fifteenth-century Italy, had remained alive within the culture and art of the Middle Ages. Even the gods were not restored to life, for they had never disappeared from the memory or imagination o:£ man. Many works published in recent years have studied the underlying causes and the means of this survival.• We aim to resume this investigation here, developing it along new lines and taking it still further, not merely to the dawn of the Renaissance but to its very declme. We have not focused our attention upon those centers of medieval humanism where the reading of clas• sical texts and the study of traces of pagan art kept the memory of the ancient gods alive in the minds of scholars and the imagination of artists; Jean Adhemar has made a contribution of the greatest interest on this aspect of the question, limited to France.• We view the problem from a different angle, and

4 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
attempt to show that the gods lived on in the Middle Ages in concepts which had already taken shape at the end of the pagan epoch-interpretations proposed by the ancients themselves to explain the origin and nature of their divinities. "It is by no means easy," observes Fontenelle in L'Histoire des oracles, "to know how the pagan peoples looked upon their own religion." In fact, they found themselves in a dilemma from the moment they first began to reason about their beliefs; for "the myth really possesses its full significance only in those epochs when man still believes himself to be living in a divine world, with no distinct notion of natural laws; hut long before the end of paganism, this first naivete had disappeared."• Indeed, the effort of modem mythographers, since early in the nineteenth century, has been to recover the primitive mentality by way of philology and anthropology, and to recapture the intuitions of the earliest periods. The ancients, however, in their inability to "investigate the origins of their own culture, to learn how their legends were formed and what may have been their earliest meaning,"• evolved contradictory theories in order to render them intelligible--theories which are brought face to face, for example, in Cicero's De natura deorum. In essence, these may be reduced to three: (1) the myths are a more or less distorted account of historical facts, in which the characters are mere men who have been raised to the rank of the i=ortals; or (2) they express the union or conflict of the elementary powers which constitute the universe, the gods then being cosmic symbols; or (3) they are merely the expression in fable of moral and philosophical ideas, in which case the gods are allegories. Now it was thanks to these interpretations, which were proposed by the ancients themselves and which integrate mythology in tum with world history, natural science, and morals, that the gods were to survive through the Middle Ages, preserved alike from oblivion and from the attacks of their enemies. But, as we have said, we plan to follow the fortunes of the gods well beyond the Middle Ages, up to the end of the sixteenth century. This will give us an opportunity to show how greatly the art and thought of the Renaissance

were indebted to that particular tradition whose astonishing persistence and unsuspected prolongations we hope to reveal. This traditional aspect of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century mythology is, in fact, less striking and less well known than any other. If one attempts to recall, for example, the profane themes most often treated in Italy at this time,6 what come first to mind are the scenes of seduction or rape, of love or drunken revelry-and admittedly no parallel to these had been seen since the end of the ancient world. The kingdom of Aphrodite and Bacchus, peopled by nymphs·and satyrs, with the Antiope of Correggio and the Ariadne of Titian as its reigning princesses, is in truth a new universe, rediscovered after the lapse of centuries ; while the predilection of artists and men of letters for voluptuous themes bears witness to the spiritual revolution which has taken place. Once again poets dare to sing of
. . . l'amour vainqueur et la vie opportune
and to glorify Desire as master of gods and of men. But alongside or above this mythical realm within which nature and the flesh have come into their own again, there exists another realm, less familiar if no less seductive, where reign the great planetary deities, the heroes, and the allegories. It is above all in monumental art that figures of this type are met with-in palace vaulting, in chapel cupolas-and their role should not be mistaken for a purely decorative one. Actually their true meaning and character may be understood only by establishing their connection with their immediate forerunners, the gods of the Middle Ages, who had survived as the incarnation of ideas. In some cases the relationship is obvious: we easily recognize in the combat of Diana and Pallas with Venus and her train, which in Mantegna's painting represents the triumph of Wisdom over Vice, one of the spiritual dramas (psychomachiae) dear to the preceding age. At the same time, however, the meaning of other mythological compositions, such as

those of Francesco Cossa in the Schifanoia Palace at Ferrara or of Baldassare Peruzzi on the ceiling of the Farnesina, becomes clear only if we see them as the outcome of the medieval astrological tradition; even the Parna,ssus of Raphael in the Stanza della Segnatura forms part of a spiritual edifice, the structural elements of which are still largely scholastic. It is difficult, it must he confessed, to trace the frontiers separating these two great profane cycles (the second of which alone concerns us here}, for one melts insensibly into the other. Even the games and dances, the idyls and the Bacchic triumphs, whose sole object is apparently to delight the senses and transport the imagination, often embody some meaning or arriere-pensee -are intended, in short, as food for the mind. It is only our indifference to the subject,' or our ignorance, which has kept us from examining or identifying it. Patient analysis would in some cases reveal the secret of the work; and at the same time we should recognize, in the classical motif thus "resurrected," the transposition of a medieval theme. The difference in styles acts as a further hindrance to our awareness of this continuity of tradition, for Italian art of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries invests the ancient symbols with fresh beauty; but the debt of the Renaissance to the Middle Ages is set forth in the texts. We shall attempt to show how the mythological heritage of antiquity was handed down from century to century, through what vicissitudes it passed, and the extent to which, toward the close of the Cinquecento, the great Italian treatises on the gods which were to nourish the humanism and art of all Europe were still indebted to medieval compilations and steeped in the influence of the Middle Ages. When conceived of in these terms, our subject, already vast and complex in itself, forces us to cover an immense period of time. We have accepted this challenge, with its inevitable risks. Frequently we have had to limit ourselves to a cursory sketch, but in such cases we have tried to indicate the main outlines without altering the proportions. For the sake of precision, we have at some points restricted our inquiry to some series of special importance, like that of the planetary figures, whose history has served us as an example of certain phenomena of survival and evolution.

INTRODUCTION 7
The essential function of the visual image, which plays so important a part in this book, is the summing up of trends or currents of thought. Our examples have been chosen and analyzed-at least for the most part-not from the formal or stylistic point of view, but rather as documents and witnesses. In many cases their mere succession furnishes us with a guiding thread; elsewhere they supplement or complement the texts. They allow us to recognize or to establish the continuity of a tradition and to trace the direc· tions in which it extends. In a word, iconography serves as a constant auxiliary to the study of the history of ideas. Finally, we have throughout subordinated our ambition to he comprehensive to our regard for clarity. To pioneer in a region which is still scarcely known because it is the meeting place of several disciplines and so belongs specifically to none, to plant signposts there and open up vistas which may help to orient other travelers-this is the end to which our efforts have been directed.

N THE APPEARANCE, early in the third century B.C., of the romance by Euhemerus which was destined to exert so lasting an influence, the intellectual climate of the Greco-Roman world was in a state exceptionally fa. vorable to its reception.' Philosophical speculation and recent history alike had prepared the way for an understanding of the process by which, in times long past, the gods had been recruited from the ranks of mortal men. Philosophy, from Aristotle onward, had recognized a divine element within the human soul, the nature of which was thus more specifically de.fined by the Stoics: "Deus est mortali juvare mortalem et haec ad aeternam gloriam via" ("For mortal to aid mortal-this is God, and this is the road to eternal glory")." A noble formula this, which Cicero develops in his Tusculan Disputations: those men have within them a supernatural element and are destined for eternal life who regard themselves as horn into the world to help and guard and preserve their fellow men. Hercules passed away to join the gods: he would never so have passed unless in the course of his mortal life he had built for himself the road he traveled.8 At the same time, the superhuman career of Alexander, and above all his expedition to India-where he became the object of adoration similar to that which, according to the myth, had once greeted Dionysus there--had suddenly thrown light upon the origin of the gods. For the generations who subsequently witnessed the official deification of the Seleucids and Ptolemies

there could he no further doubt: the traditional deities were merely earthly rulers, whom the gratitude or adulation of their subjects had raised to a place in heaven.• The appearance of Euhemerus' work was well timed. Its success was immediate. It was one of the :first books to he translated from Greek into Latin; Ennius' version, as is well known, gave it general currency in Rome, where Picus, Janus, and Saturn promptly became princes who had once ruled over Latium. The euhemeristic thesis set at rest for a time the disquiet that the traditional mythology had always inspired in the minds of educated men, who, though unable to accord it their literal belief, had nevertheless hesitated to reject as a mass of outright falsehood the time-honored tales for which Homer himself stood guarantor. A few voices, however, denounced euhemerism as impious and absurd." Above all, its prosaic character made it disappointing to the ever increasing number of persons who had succumbed to the appeal of the supernatural and craved a more emotional type of reli• gious belief.• But euhemerism was to enjoy an extraordinary revival at the beginning of the Christian era. First the apologists, then the Fathers, seized eagerly upon this weapon which paganism itself had offered them, and made use of it against its polytheistic source. It was only too easy for Clement of Alexandria, who quoted Euhemerus in his Cohortatio ad gentes (PG, VJII, 152) to declare to the infidel: "Those to whom you how were once men like yourselves."' Lactantius, again, to whom we owe the preservation of a few fragments of Euhemerus and of Ennius' translation, proclaims triumphantly in his Divinae institutiones that the gods, one and all, are nothing but mortal beings who have been raised from

earth to heaven through the idolatry of their contemporaries (PL, vr, 190 ff.). Also euhemeristic in inspiration are the De idolorum vanitate of St. Cyp· rian, the De idololatria of Tertullian, the Octavius of Minucius Felix, the Adversus nationes of Arnohius, the lnstructiones adversus gentium deos of Commodian, and the De erroribus profanarum religionum of Firmicus Maternus. St. Augustine, in the De consensu Evangelistarum (PL, XXXIV, 1056) and the De civitate Dei (vu, 18, and vm, 26), was to subscribe in his tum to this theory, which seemed bound to prove fatal to the adversary. Thus euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon which they made use of at every turn.8 In fact, as Cumont has shown," their tactics were not always wholly legitimate, being aimed for the most part at an idolatry long since extinct, and at gods whose existence had been reduced to a mere literary convention. What matters to us, however, is that the Christian apologists bequeathed to the Middle Ages a tradition of euhemerism, with further reinforcement from the commentators of Virgil--especially from Servius, whose errors the Middle Ages accepted as articles of faith.10 *
THE EUHEMERISTIC tradition remains a living influence throughout the Middle Ages, although it undergoes a total change of character. The human origin of the gods ceases to he a weapon to be used against them, a source of rejection and contempt. Instead, it gives them a certain protection, even granting them a right to survive. In the end it forms, as it were, their patent of nobility. First of all, euhemerism at a rather early date loses its polemic venom, to become instead an auxiliary to historical research. Certain men have become gods; at what period, then, were they alive upon earth? Is it possible to assign them a definite place in human history?
8 And sometimes for contradictory ends. In the towns, Christian preaching encountered a predominantly symbolic or allegoncal explanation of the myths, which had to he refuted in a summary and brutal way. In country districts, the chief obstacle to Chnstianity was offered by the tenacious survival of anthropomorphic cults; here the problem became one of still
further humanizing the divinities of springs, trees, and mountains1 in order to rob them of theu- prestige. See P. Alphandery, "L'Evhemerisme et Jes debuts de l'histoire des religions au Moyen-Age," Revue de l'hi3toire des religions, ctx (1934), pp. 1-27, esp. p. 13. 9 Le, Religions onentales dans le pagani3me rommn (4th eel., 1929), pp. 186-187.

THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
This tendency is already apparent in Eusehius. He explains in his Ecclesiastical History that the Babylonian god Baal was in reality the first king of the Assyrians, and that he lived at the time of the war between the Giants and the Titans (PG, XIX, 132-133). The coincidence in time is still only approximate, and it is clear, :furthermore, that Eusebius' main concern is to show the religion of the chosen people as antedating pagan mythology. It was he, however, who bequeathed to the Middle Ages, through St. Jerome, the pro• totype of those crude historical synchronizations which grouped all the events and characters of human history, from the birth of Abraham down to the Christian era (including the gods themselves), into a few essential periods. After Eusebius, Paulus Orosius does much the same thing. Although he is writing "adversus paganos" and wider the inspiration of Augustine, his book is ahove all an attempt to unravel the past, even the past of fable and legend; this is all the more significant since it remained a manual of the highest authority throughout the Middle Ages and even into the Renaissance, going through twenty editions in the sixteenth century. But it is in the seventh century, in the Etymolo~ae of Isidore of Seville, that we find the most interesting application of euhemerism to history, in the chapter "De diis gentium" (Bk. vm, chap. xi; PL, LXXXII, 314). "Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse produntur." 11 Not only does Isidore, following Lactantius, accept this principle-he seeks to demonstrate it. He attempts to "place" these gods "secundum ordinem temporum" in world history divided into six great periods: from the Creation to the F1ood; from the F1ood to Abraham; from Abraham to David; from David to the Babylonian Captivity; from the Captivity to the Birth of Christ; from the Nativity onward. This scheme may appear rudimentary, hut Isidore's erudition enabled him to enrich it with a wealth of marvelous detail concerning primitive Egypt, Assyria, Greece, and Rome. Drawing by way of Lactantius on Varro, and even on Ennius, he reconstructed mythological groups and dynasties: Belus, king of Assyria, of whom Eusehius had spoken, was the father of Ninus, etc. Above all, he singled out in these primitive ages the heroic :figures who, from Prometheus on, had been leaders and pioneers in civilization--slay

were once mere men."

ers of monsters, founders of cities, discoverers of arts and skills. The result was to restore dignity and independence to the personages of Fable: as benefactors of humanity they had every right to be held in grateful remembrance. And on the other hand, there was no reason for subordinating them to figures from Holy Writ-to the patriarchs, judges, and prophets; they could be ranked together, even if they were not of the same lineage. By gaining a foot• hold in history, the gods ha-d acquired new prestige. This is clearly to be seen, for example, in Ado of Vienne, whose Chronicle of the Six Ages of the World stems from the Etymologiae. After speaking of Moses and the Exodus, he refers to contemporary events in the pagan world: "In those days, it is said, lived Prometheus, who is believed to have fashioned men out of clay; his brother, Atlas, living at the same time, was regarded as a great astrologer; the grandson of Atlas, Mercury, was a sage skilled in several arts. For this reason, the vain error of his contemporaries placed him after his death among the gods" (PL, cxxm, 35). Aside from the expression "vain error," this passage has lost all accent of contempt or hostility; instead, we observe a concern for fixing dates, for determining pedigrees and genealogies, with a view to making room for the heroes of Fable in the annals of humanity. Does this not constitute a recognition of the virtues which, in times long past, had earned them their place in heaven? Parallel to the story of Scripture, this account of profane history is no longer subordinate to it; the first neither influences nor overshadows the second. Mercury has his own kind of greatness, as Moses has his. We have come a long way from Eusebius, who derived all pagan divinities from the Moses type, and for whom profane wisdom was merely a reflection of the wisdom of Israel. *
A.Do OF VIENNE is only one among the innumerable continuators of Isidore; in fact, there is hardly a chronicler or compiler of universal history writing after the great encyclopedist who fails to include humanized gods in his enumeration of ancient kings and heroes. We shall not present the endless list of these authors here, especially as it has already been compiled by others.12 Let us mention only the most important of them all Peter Comestor.

16 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
Around the year 1160, this Peter Comestor, dean of the church of Notre Dame at Troyes and later chancellor of Notre Dame at Paris, wrote under the title of Historia scholastica a history of God's people which penetrated to all parts of Europe in the translation by Guyart des Moulins (Bible historiale [1294] }• In this work, which enjoyed tremendous authority,13 we recognize in fixed and, as it were, codified form, the euhemeristic orientation that we first saw beginning to take shape in the writings of Isidore. As an appendix to his sacred history, Peter condenses the mythological material furnished him by Isidore and his predecessors, Orosius and St. Jerome, into a series of short chapters, or incidentiae. The parallelism between the two narratives, sacred and profane, is presented with curious precision: clearly, the figures from the world of Fable, though of different lineage, have now achieved a basis of strict equality with the Biblical characters. In both groups. Peter recognizes men of superior stature, geniuses endowed with pro• found and mysterious wisdom. Zoroaster invented magic and inscribed the Seven Arts on four columns (Gen. XXXIX); Isis taught the Egyptians the letters of the alphabet and showed them how to write (LXX) ; Minerva taught several arts, in particular that of weaving (LXXVI); Prometheus, renowned for his wisdom, is reputed to have created men, either because he instructed the ignorant or perhaps because he fabricated automata. All these mighty spirits are worthy of veneration, exactly as are the patriarchs, and for the same reasons: they have been the guides and teachers of humanity, and together stand as the common ancestors of civilization. This tendency of the Middle Ages to establish parallels between pagan wisdom and the wisdom of the Bible has long been recognized. It came clearly to light when study was first undertaken of the representations on cathedral portals ,. associating Sibyls and Prophets, and of the legend of Virgil, whom the medieval imagination had transformed into a kind of sorcerer or mage.'"

foreknowledge of Christian verity, and had foretold its coming. Applied to the divinities of paganism, this tendency has, as will he seen, surprising results. Not only does it "justify" the false gods by recognizing in them certain real virtues, but it even goes so far as to re-endow them with at least a part of their supernatural character.18 If we now look back at the diatribes of Arnohius and Commodian, we shall see that euhemerism was a weapon which cut both ways. What, in the in• tention of the apologists, it should have demolished, it actually confirmed and exalted. "If deification," Tertullian had argued, "is a reward of merit, why was Socrates not deified for his wisdom, Aristides for his justice, Demosthenes for his eloquence?" Tertullian, in his irony, spoke better than he knew: the Middle Ages were disposed to remedy this injustice. In his superstitious zeal, medieval man was ready to venerate sages whom antiquity itself had not placed among the immortals.
*
As WE have said, the pagan gods were no longer thought to have purloined the magic gifts they were believed to possess from the treasury of Christian wisdom. But might they not have inherited their power from the demons, with whom the first apologists often sought to identify them? 11 In the tradition with which we are concerned, it might be possible to find traces of this idea--distant recollections, hut nothing more. Neither Isidore nor his followers attribute a demonic character to the genius, the supernatural gifts which have brought about the elevation of great men to the rank of gods.18 True, Apollo and Mercury have taken on the look of magicians, hut this is no reason for regarding them with suspicion. They are good magicians, benevolent sorcerers. Humanity has much to thank them :for. That this was indeed the common attitude in the Middle Ages can he clearly seen in the works of popularization. Not only did the Historia of Peter

Comestor, which had come into general use as a te::1.-tbook (a ,eritable "memento of the history of religions," as Alphandery calls it), mold generations of readers in orthodox euhemerist views and furnish Vincent of Beauvais with all the essentials of what he wrote of the gods in the Speculum historiale; it also directly or indirectly inspired the compilations in vulgar tongues which brought science within reach of the layman.19 These books go even farther in the same direction. They proclaim the gratitude of humanity toward the men of genius whom antiquity had made into gods. The Book of the Treasure of Brunetto Latini places Hercules side by side with Moses, Solon, Lycurgus, Numa Pompilius, and the Gleek king Phoroneus as among the first legislators, who by instituting codes of law saved the nations of men from the ruin to which their own original frailty and impurity would have condemned them."° Our medieval compile1s feel themselves indebted to all tliese great men; they also feel themselves their heirs. For civilization is a treasure which has been handed down through the centuries; and as no fu1ther distinction is made between the sacred and profane precurso1s of Christianity who first forged that treasure, it is at last possible for medieval man unreservedly and even with pride to claim the heritage of antiquity. In the twelfth century, cultivated men were already aware of the Greco-Roman origins of their culture," and Chrestien de Troyes affirms the idea that France has garnered the patrimony of antique culture and viitue:

This idea reappears insistently in the popular encyclopedias of the thirteenth century.23 And among the "chevaliers" and "clercs," whose glorious tradition the French are so proud of continuing, appear valiant captains at times called Alexander or Caesar, but at others Hercules or Jason, and great inventors, now known as Ptolemy or Aristotle. and again as Mercury or Prometheus.
*
As WE have just seen, the French of the thirteenth century believed that the heritage of antiquity was theirs by special right; other peoples had long advanced the same claim. In the fifth centu1-y, the Spaniard, Paulus Orosius, boasts of being a genuine Roman; later, a Gregory of Tours, an Isidore of Seville, were to see themselves as belonging to peoples especially privileged in comparison with "ba1barian" stock. But this pride of descent, which is hardly ever absent from the learned writings of the l\I1ddle Ages, brings with it one curious consequence: in order to justify his pretentions, the scholar turns to the fabled past of antiquity for supporting witnesses, for ancestors and hegetters. Thus originate those "ethnogenic" fables tas Gaston Paris called them) which name a hero or demigod as ancestor of a whole people. One such fable, which proved to be a pa1ticularly hardy one, is famed above all-that according to which the Franks were descendants of the Trojan Francus. as the Romans were of the Trojan Aeneas. This legend was an invention of Merovingian scholars," but it should not be dismissed as a mere fantasy of learned minds. It was taken seriously as genealogy, and became a "veritable form of ethnic consciousness.""' Its plausibility was enhanced by the apocryphal journals of the siege of Troy by the "Cretan" Dictys and the "Phrygian" Dares, which had been popular ever since the Greek decadence:

This, then, is one of the effects of euhemerism in the Middle Ages: mythological figures are no longer presented as common benefactors of humanity. They are the patrons of this or that people,07 the parent stem from which the race has issued and from which it derives its glory.

assure their survival. They are still given a place in history: not only do the early chronicles, printed and many times reissued, retain their full authority, hut the fifteenth-century chroniclers follow their lead, and never fail to devote one or more chapters to the pagan divinities. This is true of the Rudimentum noviciorum (1475), the Fasciculus temporum (1475), and the Mer des hystoires ( 1488) ; also of Annius of Viterho, the pseudo commentator on Berosus,28 and Jacopo da Bergamo. The last-named, for example, in his Suppl.ementum chronicarum,29 studies the origin and the pedigrees of the gods (Bk. m, f. 12). Jupiter is a king who has been worshipped under that name because of his resemblance to the planet Jupiter; other kings have borne the same name, notably the king of Candia, a son of Saturn-who is, of course, historical, as are Ops, Caelus, Uranus, Vesta, etc.80 Then Semiramis is dealt with, and Lot and Isaac; hut a little later (f. 15, rand v) the gods reappear-Cybele, Pallas, the Sun, Diana. Next we pass to Jacob, Leah, and Rachel, and to the monarchs of Assyria; then come Ceres and Isis (f. 16, 17 r) ; and after a paragraph devoted to Joseph, we meet Apollo, Bacchus, Vulcan, Apis, and Osiris. As in Peter Comestor, mythology alternates with sacred history. It is of interest to note also that this compilation by Jacopo da Bergamo includes additional chapters on the Sibyls and on the Trojan war, a geographical section containing a list of all cities famed since the beginning of time, and, last of all, a contemporary history. The sixteenth century is in this respect a repetition of the fifteenth: the Promptuaire of Guillaume Rouille (Promptuarium iconum insigniorum a saeculo hominum [1553]), the World Chronicle of Antoine du Verdier (Prosopographie ou Description des personnes, patriarches, prophetes, dieux des gentils, roys, cor.suls, princes, grands capitaines, dues, philosophes, orateurs, poetes, ;uriconsultes et inventeurs de plusieurs arts, avec les effigies llaucuns lliceux ••• [1573] ), and the compilation by Eilhardus Lubinus (Fax poetica sive genealogia et res gestae deorum gentilium, virorum, regum,

*
Tmrs THE EXISTE...,CE of the gods continues to he sanctioned on historical grounds; furthermore, as in the Middle Ages, there is a disposition to regard them as the forerunners of civilization. This tendency is already very evident in Jacopo da Bergamo. Minerva, he says, was the first woman to understand the art of working in wool (f. 15) ; Chiron was the inventor of medicine (f. 18, r), Hermes Trismegistus the first astronomer (f. 21, r), Mercury the first musician (f. 20, v). Prometheus taught men to make fire and to wear rings (f. 19, r) ; Atlas taught the Greeks astrology (ibid.). Apollo, Aesculapius, etc., are placed in a section entitled "Viri disciplinis excellentes"; other gods, like Faunus, Mars, etc., appear under the heading: "Viri doctrinis excellentes." Even more typical, from the same point of view, is the De inventoribus of Polydore Virgil.31 In the preface, already present in the first (1499) edition, we find first a declaration of euhemeristic belief: "And whatsoever things may have been attributed by us to Saturn, Jove, Neptune, Dionysus, Apollo, Aesculapius, Ceres, Vulcan, and to such others as have the name of gods, we have thus attributed to them as to mortal men, and not as to gods, even though we still call them by that name." After this declaration, which he obviously thinks should protect him from any quibbling on the part of the ecclesiastical authorities, Polydore does not hesitate to salute each god as an innovator: Hermes Trismegistus established time divisions (n, 5); from Bacchus, man learned how to make wine (III, 3) ; Venus taught the courtesans their art (m, 17); Mercury, according to Diodorus and Cicero, taught the alphabet to the Egyptians (1, 6). Pliny attributes man's knowledge of the heavenly bodies to Jupiter Belus; Diodorus, to Mercury (1, 17).

24 THE SURVIP AL OF THE PAGAN GODS
FINALLY, we have noted during the Middle Ages a strange phenomenon-a whole people claiming a mythological hero as ancestor, choosing him, as it were, for their progenitor and patron. This phenomenon persists into the Renaissance, even taking on new and striking forms. The legend of the Trojan origin of the Franks was, as is well known, exploited by Jean Le Maire de Belges, in his Illustrations de Gaule et singularites de Troie, which attained immense popularity. One reason for this success was that "nearly every nation could find there, as if in an archival setting, its most ancient titles of nobility. Only the Germans and French could boast undisputed descent from Hector himself, hut others-Bretons, Flemings, Scandinavians, Normans, Italians, and Spaniards-also found ways of asserting their own relationship with him, to justify either their pride or their ambition." 03 Now Le Maire distributed the names of the various Trojan heroes, like spoils of war, among these claimants: the Bretons were said to be descendants of Brutus, first king of Brittany; the Spaniards of Hesperus, the Italians of Italus, the men of Brabant of Brabo, the Tuscans of Tuscus, and the Burgundians of Hercules the Great of Libya.•• Let us further note that Jean Le Maire greatly strengthens the divine element in the legend of Troy. The gods are given a preponderant role in his historico-mythological romance--something which we do not find in Dictys, Dares, or Benoit de Sainte-Maure:• Ronsard's Franciade was less successful than the Illustrations; the failure and neglect which were to be the lot of this enthusiastically anticipated epic are well known. But the Franciade reveals a new tendency which is particularly appropriate to the Renaissance: it is inspired not by "ethnic consciousness" but by dynastic pride. Charles IX personally supervised the composition of the poem,'" in his concern to have it establish a direct connection

between the sixty-three sovereigns of his own line and the most fabulous antiquity. Princely pretensions of this sort, indeed, are seldom glimpsed before the end 0£ the Middle Ages. In 1390, however, Jacques de Guise ~Tote a universal chronicle which bore this revealing title: Annales de l'histoire des illustres princes de Hainaut, depuis le commencement du monde.3' Later, the dukes of Burgundy were to pride themselves on their descent from a demigod; the Trojan legends were in great favor at their court-and that as early as the fourteenth century."" Late in the fifteenth, a Recueil des histoires de Troyes (1464) was being read there, in which Hercules is given unwonted prominence. The author, Raoul Lefene, proposes to deal with his subject in three books, the second of which is to treat of the Labors of Hercules, and to show that he twice destroyed the city of Troy. Furthermore, Hercules appeared in the tapestries decorating the hall where the Banquet of the Pheasant Oath was held (Lille, 1454), and in a pantomime performed at the wedding festivities of Charles the Bold and Margaret 0£ York. Why this special emphasis upon Hercules? It is due to his reputed place as founder of the dynasty. Olivier de la Marche relates in his Memoires that Hercules, journeying long ago into Spain, passed through the land of Burgundy and there met a lady of great beauty and noble lineage, Alise by name. They were wed, and from their union issued the line of Burgundian princes. Another mythological hero, Jason, was well known at the Burgundian court: Philip the Good put himself under his aegis when, in 1430, he founded the Order of the Golden Fleece. To be sure, a Biblical hero, Gideon, seconded Jason in his functions as patron of the order. But this very partnership, bringing out as it does the parallelism between sacred and profane,

serves admirably to illustrate the persistence of the medieval point of view."" Princely pride found ample satisfaction in these claims of mythological sponsorship and heredity. In addition to the dukes of Burgundy and the kings of France. should we perhaps also cite the example of Pope Alexander VI, who used the Borgia coat of arms as warrant for having the ceiling of his Vatican apartments decorated with frescoes representing the story of Isis, Osiris, and the monster Apis-unexpected antecedents, indeed, for a Chris• tian pontiff? .,.,. Other comparable instances might be found in the seventeenth century. In 1600, the Jesuits of A\ignon, charged with organizing the ceremonial reception given by the city to Marie de Medicis, bestowed on her royal consort the title of Gallic Hercules ("Hercule Gaulois"), justifying the extravagant flattery on the following grounds: '•L'illustre maison de Navarre a prins sa source de l'ancien He1cule, fils d"Osiris, lequel ayant hattu et comhattu Jes Lominiens, qui etaient Jes trois enfants de Ge1yon, tyran des Espagnes, et ayant affranchi ce peuple de leur senitude, etablit en cette monarchie son fils

ICONOGRAPHY, in turn, attests the continuity of the "euhemeristic" tradition, and gh-es striking illustration to its varied aspects. We shall limit ourselves to a few examples. In the first place, for visual demonstration of the insertion of the gods into history, let us glance at a Proven1,al chronicle (British Museum, Egerton ms. 1500) of the early fourteenth century tafter 1313}.

3. Apollo Medicus
The most typical example of the tradition of the heroes and sages that places profane and sacred history on the same plane, is afforded by the famous series of drawings attributed to Maso Finiguerra, preserved in the British Museum under the title of Florentine Picture Chronicle." Sir Sidney Colvin, who had studied the drawings extensively and dated them between 1455 and 1465, related them to a Sommario, or Breve historia universale, in the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence (Cat. xxv. IV, 565, II. IV, 348). These drawings, in fact, present another illustrated world chronicle; they show us, after Adam and Eve, the patriarchs, Noah, Abraham, and their successors, along with "contemporary" pagan :figures-Inachus, Cecrops, Codrus, Saturn, Jupiter, etc. What is particularly notable is the parallelism established between all these great :figures of the past, historical or legendary, Jew or Gentile-Prophets and Sibyls, judges, warriors, poets, and lawgivers. Especially significant is the prominence given to heroes (Jason,

Standing at a patient's bedside, with his conjuring hooks and imps, he seems engaged in some terrifying act of exorcism. He looks like an Oriental magician, and in adjacent drawings we do in fact encounter. similarly accoutered, Hostanes conjuring up demons, and Oromasdes resuscitating a dead person. In the same group appear Zoroaster, Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Linus, and Musaeus-all the esoteric wisdom of Persia, Egypt, and Greece.43

The parallelism between sacred and profane history is further set forth in one of the most exquisite works of the Renaissance, the fa. <_.ade of the Colleoni Chapel in Bergamo, where alternating bas-reliefs represent events from the Old Testament and from mythology, the punishment of Adam and the Labors of Hercules:' At approximately the same date, Lombard sculptors ornamented the zone at the base of the fa<..ade of the Certosa ' of Pavia with medallions which show Prophets side by side with emperors " and gods-a strange series of apocryphal portraits in which the infant Hercules strangles ser, pents and Judas Maccabeus wears a Mercury cap, and which recalls the numismatic fantasies of the ''prosopographies." .. Of the personages of Fable viewed expressly as inventors of arts and skills we possess some celebrated images in the lowest zone of bas-reliefs on the Campanile in Florence.

Here we have the euhemeristic tradition at its purest and noblest; the best commentary on these sculptures is the passage in which Cicero exalts the animus divinus of the precursors of civilization: "Omnes magni: etiam superiores, qui vestitum, qui tecta, qui cultum vitae, qui praesidia contra £eras invenerunt; a quibus mansuefacti et exculti, a necessariis artificiis ad elegantiora defluximus. • ••" "

two main forms which we detected at the outset. At times we have to do with a tribute of gratitude and veneration offered to great men; at others, with extravagant adulation of worldly power. In both cases, the recipients are raised to the rank of gods.

T
H E H EA v E N LY bodies are gods. "We must assign the same divinity to the stars."' This opinion, at the time of its formulation hy Cicero, was on the way to becoming general. For a Roman or Alexandrian of that age, the stars were not as they are for us, "bodies infinitely remote in space, which move according to the inflexible laws of mechanics, and whose composition is chemically determinable." They were "divinities."• Every mind which pe.tceives a governing intelligence behind the movement of the spheres instinctively places this divine power in heaven.• From this it is but a step to considering the sun, moon, and stars as in themselves divine. Among other determining factors, it was the mythological names given to the stars-in obedience to the same instinct-which above all else encouraged the Greeks, and after them the Romans, to take this step. Nomen, numen--the name alone was enough to lend divine personality to each luminous body moving in the heavens, but complete identification was achieved when that name was Hercules or Mars, that is, the name of a god whose appearance and history were already well known. And the mythological imagination of the Greeks, which had created gods on earth, could readily picture them in the skies as well. However, this identification of the gods with astral bodies, which had been fully accomplished by the end of the pagan era, was the end product of

a complex evolution. For the constellations, as for the planets, the process of "mythologization" was steady, if not continuous.• For the constellations, the process had begun in Homeric times: Homer himself speaks of "mighty Orion."' But in general the stars and groups of stars were still known merely by the names of objects or animals-the Scales, the Ram, etc. Toward the fifth century B.C., many of the constellations had become associated with myths; in the fourth, the catalogue of Eudoxus of Cnidus-which, though scientific in spirit, adopted the vocabulary of mythand, a century later, Aratus' poem on the stellar configurations, still further encouraged the same tendency. The famous Farnese Globe in the Naples Mu. sewn, copied from a Greek original probably contemporary with Aratus, shows us a sky in part invaded by the gods.• Eratosthenes (284-204 B.c.), in his Catasterismi, completes this evolution and standardizes its results: each of the constellations is given mythological significance, and the signs of the zodiac themselves are connected with heroes of Fahie. The Lion, for example, is the Nemean lion who was overcome by Hercules; the Bull is the hull of the Europa story. At this stage, the fusion between astronomy and mythology is so complete that no further distinction is made between them: the Augustan poet, Hyginus, is at one and the same time astronomer and mythographer. But a phenomenon is already beginning to he apparent _:which is destined to involve this celestial mythology in fearful chaos: the traditional Greek constellations are being supplemented or replaced by exotic constellations. First, thirty-six genii alleged to he of Egyptian origin, the decans,' insinuate themselves into the zodiacal hand, each one having its own name and face (1tp6a1,n:ov) which gives it concrete and independent personality; the decans, too, are both stars and divinities.• But these were not the only foreign elements

to invade Greek astronomy. Scholars had drawn up lists of the paranatellons, i.e., the stars rising to the north and to the south of each of the zodiacal signs, and we note that the register of these stars, established in the first century of our era by Teucer the Babylonian, contains a great many glyphs or sigils which are likewise of Egyptian origin," or perhaps even Chaldean or Anato• lian. Finally, from now on the Greek celestial globe (sphaera graecanica) has as a kind of parasite a barbaric globe (sphaera barbarica) ,1° the mythological elements of which live on, and in the course of the centuries become mingled with those of classical origin. With the planets the process is even more complicated. Originally the Greeks singled out only one, Venus, 'E<ua<f,opo; or "Ear.spa; in Homer. They learned from the Babylonians to distinguish the :five wandering stars from the :fixed stars forming the constellations, and--still following the same example--consecrated each of the :five to a different deity. For every Babylonian god a Greek god who bore some resemblance to him in character was substituted as master of the same planet:1 This identification was probably the work of the Pythagoreans; it came about in the :fifth century B.C. Nevertheless, as Cumont emphasizes, the planets in Plato's time have no true names, the names of the gods serving merely to indicate possession-o (:za-:3⁄4p) -:06 Kp6vou ("star of Kronos"), etc. During the Alexandrian period the planetary lexicon becomes extraordinarily confused. The planets change masters and their labels are correspondingly multiplied: the patroness of our planet Venus is no longer Aphrodite but Hera, while Mars is placed under the dominion of Hercules rather than Ares. The diversity of cults in the Seleucid Empire which, as we have seen, has already resulted in peopling the Greek celestial globe with barbaric constellations, still further complicates the terminology. To the Egyptians, Mars-Hercules is known as Horus the Red, and Jupiter as Osiris; in Phrygia the planet Venus is sacred to Cybele, mother of the gods. To make matters

worse, the Egyptian decans combine with the planets as they have already combined with the signs of the zodiac." The Greek astronomers then felt that a fixed nomenclature had become a necessity, and-preceded here too hr their Chaldean colleagues-invented for each planet a name derived simply from its physical aspect: for Mercury, ::Ed).~<,1v, the Brilliant One; for Saturn, ~alv<,1v, the Shining One, etc. This purely scientific and "lay" nomenclature was in use in the third century in Alexandria; Cicero mentions it still in the De natura deorum, and it was naturally in favor with the erudite. But the old designations lingered on, and entered more and more widely into everyday speech. Soon, in fact-from the end of the Republic--the abbreviations Satumus and Jupiter begin to he used in prose instead of sidus (or stella) Satumi, / ovis, etc. In the same way, in the Hellenic countries the circumlocution o(aa-;~p) o;oG Kp6vou gives way to the simple substantive Kp6vo;. Now this "is not merely a linguistic change; it implies a modification in the religious conception of the planets. They are no longer regarded as being subject to certain divinities who supposedly con• trol their movements or who exert patronage over them. • • • The seven bodies which move periodically within the zodiacal band are henceforth figures within which divinity is incorporated--eompletely identified with it from this time forward." 13

IF WE now seek to identify the leading influences which have favored this definitive fusion between gods and astral bodies, we shall find Zeno and his school at the head of the list. Constantly concerned as they were for reconciling philosophy with respect for the ancient beliefs, the Stoics had finally come, through repeated concessions, to acknowledge that a physical meaning lay at the root of each myth: "Physica ratio non inelegans inclusa est in impias fahulas." ,.

Ennius, met with the same success there. It brought welcome relief to many moderate minds who asked nothing better than some pretext £or adhering to their old religion: if the gods are symbols for the cosmic powers, mythology ceases to appear absurd and immoral.10 In fact,18 this rationalist interpretation legitimized for most people the deification of the heavenly bodies, which, as we have already seen, was irresistibly suggested to them by the astronomical nomenclature. But the decisive influence, beyond any doubt, was that of the Oriental religions. From the day the cults of the East--e&pecially the Persian cult of the sun and the Babylonian cult of the planets-began to spread into the Greco-Roman world, the belief in sidereal divinities was not only confirmed; 11 it took on an extraordinary religious £error. For the Chaldeans, in fact, the heavenly bodies were the gods par excellence, presiding over the destiny of men and empires. The diffusion of astrology during the decline of the ancient world has formed the subject of a number of works so well known that it needs no extended treatment here.•• Its most striking symptom was the adoption of the planetary week, which began to spread in the time of Augustus, and has survived to the present day. Let us note merely that during the last centuries of paganism belief in the divinity of the heavenly bodies grew even stronger. The stars are alive: they have a recognized appearance, a sex, a character, which their names alone suffice to evoke. They are powerful and redoubtable beings, anxiously prayed to and interrogated, since it is they who inspire all human action. They reign over human life and hold in their keeping the secrets of man's fortune and of his end. Benevolent or deadly, they determine the fate of peoples and individuals by the mere accident of their movements, their conjunctions and oppositions. To conciliate these dangerous masters everyone, from the Emperor down to the circus groom, had recourse to the arts of the Chaldean soothsayers, a fraternity as indispensable as it was ill-famed.

tans boasted that they could bring the spirit of a star down from heaven and render it propitious both for this life and the next. Amulets and talismans were everywhere in circulation. Increasingly-as, for example, among the Neoplatonists of the third century--obsession with the divine and the demoniacal began to mingle with concepts of natural law and mechanics. Science lost ground to superstition and magic, or at the very least became inextricably involved with them. Let us note., furthermore, that this process of "'absorption" of the gods by the stars which we have sketched finally resulted in assuring the gods 0£ survival. One might indeed call it a piece of unhoped-for good luck on their side., for the old mythology had long been bankrupt and the Olympians had become mere phantoms. Now, however, a providential shelter is offered them: ''the great gods find honorable refuge in the planets," while the demigods and heroes ascend to people the sky with "catasterisms." 19 Thus, though dethroned or about to be dethroned on earth, they are still masters of the celestial spheres, and men will not cease to invoke them and fear them.'0
*
SucH WAS the situation with which Christianity found itself confronted. In its intolerance of all the pagan cults, it is only natural that special hostility should have been shown to their most recent and lively embodiment-belief in powerful stellax divinities, with Helios as their king. This hostility is in fact apparent from the very beginnings of Christian• ity: St. Paul reproaches the Galatians for continuing to observe "days and months and times and years" in the name 0£ the "weak and beggarly elements" to which they desire again to be in bondage.21 Later, the apologists (here, incidentally, echoing the views of Philo 0£ Alexandria) •• explain that

process by which the totem anunals of the primitive religions "took refuge" long ago in the zodiac (Cumontl. 20 Astrology, furthermore, created and made
her own a mass of new gods, some of whom
are singularly abstrsct-Heaven and Time, the Years, Months, Seasons, etc. The Stoics had already "deified" the elements. 01 Galatians 4:9-10. •• See, for example, Lactantius, De dl'D. inst.

it is a crime to deify the physical world-to worship the thing created instead of the creator. What seems to them particularly impious in the worship of the heavenly bodies, as well as a danger to morals, is that such worship implies a denial of all human liberty and can end only in a discouraging fatalism."" At first sight, it would therefore seem that Christianity had nothing hut cause to abhor pagan astrology and to oppose it. In actual fact, however, something quite different took place. To begin with, Christianity itself contained astrological elements; 24 too many traces of the Hellenistic and Oriental religions, too much philosophy and science, were intertwined at its very roots for it to he able to rid itself of them completely. Accordingly, not only did the mythological names for the days of the week survive in spite of a certain amount of protest and some timid attempts to substitute a Christian terminology," but we even see the Church of Rome her• self, in the middle of the fourth century, officially fixing the twenty-fifth of December as the date of Christ's nathity-the same day which had marked the birth of the Sun in the pagan religions, since the yearly course of each new sun has its beginning then!'' Aurelian, in his day, had made the sun a god of the Empire. Later, the first Christian Emperor was to have himself represented in the likeness of the Sun God on a porphyry column in Constantinople.:' Thus we see that astrology still had its partisans and believers among the Christians, while even its adveisaries made important concessions. Tertullian, not without embarrassment, admits that astiology was valid up to the birth of Christ; now, however, one can no longer look to Saturn, Mars, and

the other "dead" gods for knowledge of the future."" Most devout Christians share the view of Origen: supported by texts from the Bible, they still believe in the power of the stars-although that power has certain limitations. The stars, they hold, cannot act in a manner contrary to the will of God; they may not force man to sin. However, they do continue to function as signs through which the Deity announces His benevolent or threatening intent."" Neither Lactantius nor St. Augustine,00 again, casts doubt upon the fact of stellar influence, but both believe that it can be overcome by man's free will and by the grace of God. In short, "since, according to the doctrine of predestination, man's eternal salvation or doom depends solely upon the will of God, many see in the compulsion exercised by the stars-an inevitable compulsion, which determines the moral life as well-merely another expression of this doctrine; at all events, God's omnipotence makes manifest its immutable decrees to man through the stars as intermediary."•• Furthermore, even when the apologists and Fathers interpret astrology in this way-and even when they condemn it-they leave untouched the underlying belief in demons in which it is rooted. The existence of evil angels is an article of faith with them all, as it is for the Church; but the gods of pagan fable are now combined with the demons mentioned in the Bible in one confused rabble of malevolent spirits."' "The things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God," says Paul, speaking of the Gentiles.33 For

centuries to come, preachers will still go about the countryside expelling "the demons Jupiter, Mercury," etc., from haunts where they have lingered... It is through the stars and through astrology that these demons often act. In former times, for man's temptation and perdition, they taught him to read the stars... Now, scattered through the air (aeria animalia, as St. Augustine says) ,38 they make use of the heavenly bodies to aid them in their evil dominion. After this, Augustine's anathema against "mathematicorum fallaces divinationes et impia deliramenta:" ., seems somewhat vain, especially since he elsewhere affirms the corporeal reality of the evil powers of heaven. On this point, the great Bishop is in agreement with the "magician" Apuleius 38-with the difference that Apuleius admits the existence of friendly demons. And his arguments, aimed at destroying astrology as a religion, sometimes have the effect of reinstating and confirming it. Last of all, there is one fundamentally important reason why astrology was by no means easily to be extirpated: it stood as an integral and essential element of culture. As we have seen, it had intimately invaded the science of the late pagan world-to such a degree, in fact, that it dominated all the natural sciences. Not only had astronomy fallen under its sway, but mineralogy, botany, zoology, physiology, and medicine as well.39 A glance at the tabulation reproduced below (p. 47), in illustration of the system advanced by an astrologer of the second century of our era, Antiochus of Athens, will show that all physical beings were thought of as related to the zo. diac. It was therefore a simple matter to connect them with the planets as well, hy making use of the "fundamental qualities" of the planets as intermediaries. Mars, in fact, was "hot-dry," Jupiter and Venus were "hot-moist,"

etc. Similarly, correspondence was established between the planets and the elements-between Mars and Fire, between Jupiter and Air, between Mercury and the Moon on the one hand and Water on the other. Insofar as the Christian community was receptive to pagan culture, therefore, it could not neglect astrology. Now the Church Fathers were urged by two considerations to admit all these studies into the Christian curriculum -their concern that the Christian he in no way inferior to the non-Christian, and their sense of the need for a proper understanding of their own religion. For, as St. Augustine recognizes, knowledge of natural history and astronomy is essential to a right reading of Scripture and a true understanding of divine things... This theory might prove disturbing to overscrupulous believers. In order to reassure them and to justify profane studies the Fathers invoked a most appropriate Biblical episode: when the Hebrew people emerged from Egypt, they carried away with them vessels of gold and silver belonging to their enemies. Why should Christianity not do the same?., It was on the strength of this argument, many times repeated, that ancient science was to pass over into the Middle Ages... But along with it, all sorts of religious elements, classical or barbaric, passed over as well, and were in many cases to outlive the vicissitudes, the periods of eclipse and shipwreck, experienced by science itself.

48 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
which are not hard to explain. In the first place, the active principle basic to astrology, the fear of demons, had survived. The Church, it should be recalled, had not completely expelled the antique divinities; they had merely been degraded to the rank of e"il spirits. In this form, they still inspired superstitious fears. To be sure, such fears were now to some extent dispelled and held in check by the belief in the omnipotence of a supreme God capable of subduing adverse forces in obedience to His will: God could save man from demons--but they were none the less there, still living and fearsome. We are told in the Golden Legend that when St. Benedict was preaching against idolatry to the people of Monte Cassino, he converted a temple of Apollo into an oratory of St. John. But the enraged god returned to torment him in the form of a black monster with flaming eyes... While the fear of demons continues to haunt the popular imagination, the astrological theory of causation remains in force as an intellectual con• cept; even the greatest minds do not repudiate it entirely. They do of course see that omnipotence of the stars could constitute a threat to human liberty, hut like the apologists and the Fathers, they are satisfied with defining the limits of this power; they do not deny its existence.'" St. Thomas Aquinas admits that the stars determine individual character, at least in a physical sense, and since most men follow their passions--that is to say, their physical appetites--it is really by the stars that they are led into sin: "Plures hominum sequuntur passiones, quae sunt motus sensitivi appetitus, ad quos cooperari possunt corpora coelestia. • . ." And Dante, on this point, faithfully follows in his master's footsteps: while affirming freedom of the will,41 he at the same time recognizes the influence of cosmic forces on the human soul:

THE PHYSICAL TRADITION 49
"Astra inclinant; non necessitant." With this reservation, astrology con• tinues as the foundati~ of profane culture and the underlying principle of all science, "la fin de toute clergie." Everything leads hack to the stars, and their influence is everywhere exerted. Declining antiquity, as we have seen, had set up a system of concordances in which the planets and zodiacal signs served as the basis of classification for the elements, seasons, and humors. The encyclopedic spirit of the Middle Ages was not satisfied with merely reviving this tradition, with working out more or less ingenious schemes of its own for demonstrating numerical relationships between the component elements--Mundus, Annus, and Homo!" In its preponderant concern for unification, for building a scientia universalis, scholasticism still further developed the concordance tables, leaning upon more and more specious analogies as it did so. For example, Alexander Neckam, in his De natura rerum,00 presents in codified form the relationship between the planets and virtues which had first been established in the ninth century; while in the Convivio," Dante draws a parallel between the same planets and the seven liberal arts: "Alli sette primi (cieli) rispondono le sette scienze del Trivio e del Quadrivio." Grammar corresponds to the sphere of the moon, dialectic to the sphere of Mercury, etc. Dante thus outlines a complete system of knowledge, corresponding point for point with the astrological system. But such relationships imply that influences are present: man, who represents the world in summarized form, is dependent on the cosmic forces, which are combined in his make-up in the same proportions as in the universe at large. The theory of macrocosm and microcosm-inherited from Neoplatonism, transmitted to medieval thought by way of Boethius, and developed by Bernard of Tours (called Silvestris) in a famous treatise 112finds one of its most curious applications in medicine: in order to learn the fate of a patient, if not actually to cure him, use is still made of strange cal

culating machines based upon astronomical data. One such machine was the "sphere of Petosiris," said by F. J. Boll to have been invented in the :first <.Jen• tury A.D.13 In treating the patient, it was necessary to remember that, in accordance with the Greek principle of melothesuz,.. his anatomy and physiology were governed by the stars. Each zodiacal sign ruled over some part of the body, and each planet over certain organs and limbs. A surgeon must not operate when the moon was in the sign on which the affected member was thought to be dependent; otherwise the planet's moisture would immediately bring about the gravest complications... It is thus clear to what point astrology had penetrated science, both in theory and in practice. Nor were all these notions confined to learned circles alone. They gamed general currency in popular encyclopedias as early as the thirteenth century, pending their further popularization in the fourteenth in the hooks of hours and calendars."' It goes without saying that mythological terminology survived as a concomitant of astrological doctrine. Timid attempts were nevertheless made to abolish at least the pagan names of the zodiacal signs; we have already mentioned the effo1t to Chiistianize the names of the days of the week (cf. supra, p. 43). Similarly, during the early Christian centuries, the "astrotheosophers" had wished to transform Cepheus into Adam, Cassiopeia into Eve, and Perseus into Logos,"' while the Priscillians had replaced the signs of the zodiac by the twelve patriarchs."" In the Carolingian period, a certain "Hirenicus" tries, in turn, in a poem on the zodiac, to adjust the signs to Christian symbolism, turning Aries into the Lamb, etc...

Abraham; Aries, Job; and Leo, Daniel. But these attempts were of no avail; on the contrary, the astronomer William of Conches proclaims the legitimacy of the stellar mythology, and the necessity of knowing it well. He tells us that certain authors have spoken of the astral bodies in terms of myth (mythice), mentioning Nimrod, Hyginus, and Aratus, and their accounts of the origin of the zodiacal signs--one example being Taurus, the bull (Jupiter) which abducted Europa. "This way of treating of celestial things is legitimate; without it we would not know in what part of the sky a given sign is located, how many stars it contains, nor how they are arranged." 61
*
IN THE EVOLUTION of astrology during the Middle Ages, two main periods must be distinguished. Up to the twelfth century, the only learned sources available to Western scholars were Macrobius' commentary on the Somnium Scipionis, Firmicus Maternus, the Latin commentators on Plato's Timaeus, and the short expositions in Isidore and Bede.02 During this period, the focus of astrology was in Byzantium, where it reappeared hand in hand with astronomy after the seventh-century decline. In spite of isolated cases of protest on the part of churchmen, it flourished there more and more brightly till the fall of the Eastern Empire, and it is to the interest which it inspired that we owe a large proportion of the manuscripts copied by Byzantine scholars which have preserved for us the treasures of classical science."' But this treasure had been garnered by the Arabs as well. They had inherited physics and the natural sciences from Aristotle, and the Almagest

and Tetrabiblos from Ptolemy. In due time they were to transmit this herit• age to the Occident, enriched by having passed through the hands of their own scholars, like Alhumazar and Al-Kabisi. Thanks to the Crusades, and to the penetration of Arab philosophy and science into Sicily and Spain, Europe came to know the Greek texts with their Arab commentaries, in Latin translations for the most part made by Jews... The result was an extraordinary increase in the prestige of astrology, which between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries enjoyed greater favor than ever before. It was during this period that the greatest princes took astrologers into their service as intimate counselors---Frederick II of Hohenstaufen and Alfonso the Wise in the thirteenth century, and in the fourteenth Charles V of France. In Italy, astrologers directed the life of cities, condottieri, and prelates."" The astrologers were anxiously interrogated, just as the "Chaldeans" had been hy Romans of the Empire; strong in its new prestige, astrology inspired new fears. Furthermore, the Arabs had developed one of its most threatening aspects in the theory of planetary conjunction. The appearance together in the same constellation of the three major planets---Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter-could precipitate illness, war, famine, and religious upheavals. The birth of Mohammed, long ago, had actually coincided with such a conjunction, and the Black Death of 1348 again confirmed the same terrible portent.88 There was a growing sense of inexorable doom threatening from the skies. Timar feci.t deos: the fear of demons revived at the same time. In all these threats which hung over them, men felt evil presences at work, and looked to the magicians for means of escape or propitiation. We are fortu.

nate in possessing a document of cardinal importance which throws into sharp relief this recrudescence of the demonic in astrology and the state of mind which resulted. This is a manual of magic, composed in Arabic in the tenth century from Oriental and Hellenistic elements, translated into Spanish at the court of Alfonso X, and widely circulated in the late Middle Ages. Some twenty Latin manuscripts are known."' This manual, the Arabic title of which is GhliJ a and the Latin title Picatrix (probably a corruption of Hippocrates), is openly and professedly a treatise on the practice of magic, based on astral science. Indeed, its aim is to conciliate the "spirits" and to utilize their power, though for Picatrix spirits and planets are intimately associated, if not actually interchangeable. "Many instructions are given how to pray to each of the planets and to work magic by their aid, just as if they were demons." 88 For all this there is an established ritual. Picatrix prescribes propitious times and places and the attitude and gestures of the suppliant; he also indicates what terms must be used in petitioning the stars. Here, for example, is his formula for a prayer to Saturn: "0 Master of sublime name and great power, supreme Master; 0 Master Saturn: Thou, the Cold, the Sterile, the Mournful, the Pernicious; Thou, whose life is sincere and whose word sure; Thou, the Sage and Solitary, the Impenetrable; Thou, whose promises are kept; Thou who art weak and weary; Thou who hast cares greater than any other, who knowest neither pleasure nor joy; Thou, the old and cunning, master of all artifice, deceitful, v.ise, and judicious; Thou who bringest prosperity or ruin, and makest men to he happy or unhappy! I conjure Thee, 0 Supreme Father, by Thy great benevolence and Thy generous bounty, to do for me what I ask. . . ." In this pagan prayer one finds, as F. Saxl has pointed out,69 the accent

and even the very terms of a Greek astrological prayer to Kronos. This is one indication that the sources of Picatrix are in large part Hellenistic.'0 But how amazing to think that such prayers were now being raised to the skies in Christian Europe! Let us now ask by what material means, what tools, the magician hoped to force the astral divinities to lend him their aid. One essential factor was the actual likeness of the god.

cording to the aspect of the heavens at some particularly favorable moment, such images were supposed to receive the greatest possible amount of celestial influence and to store it away, so to speak, for future use. To this end, Picatrix describes some fifty images of :fixed stars, planets, and zodiacal signs, the efficacy of which he guarantees. Surprises are in store for us as we read these descriptions. To assure the favor of Jupiter, for instance, a white stone should be engraved with the figure of a crowned personage seated on a throne, his hand upraised (see fig. 12, taken from the lapidary of Alfonso X); each of the four feet of the throne should rest on the neck of a winged man. Who is this personage? None other than the Olympian Zeus as described by Pausanias: "The god sits on a throne, and he is made of gold and ivory. On his head lies a garland. . . . In the left hand is a scepter. • • . There are four Victories . • . one at each foot of the throne. . . ." 71 To win the benevolence of Mars, one needs a gem engraved with the image of "a young man, naked-at his right a young girl with hair knotted at the hack of her head; his left hand rests on her breast, his

Here we have a barbaric Saturn: "The fo1m of Saturn, in the opinion of the learned Picatrix, is that of a man seated on a throne, ha\·ing a crow's head and the feet of a camel." Elsewhere appears a Jupiter with lion's head and cock's spurs. We shall have occasion later to study these puzzling figures more closely; here let us recall merely that ever since the end of the pagan era monsters out of the East had been making their way into the firmament, mingling with the Greek gods who had won a place there. As a matter of fact, gems bearing effigies of the gods had been in un• interrupted use throughout the Middle Ages. Great monasteries had their collect1ons of antique cameos and intaglios as early as the seventh century. The seal of Charlemagne is a head of Jupiter Serapis; sometimes we even make the surprising discovery of a Venus Anadyomene or a Leda on an ecclesias• tical seal. Gems with mythological subjects are often found mounted in crosses, on book covers,and reliquaries!' Scholars have been much intrigued by this phenomenon, asking them• selves why and in what spirit pagan gems were put to such unexpected uses. The explanation in some ca&es lies doubtless in mere ignorance, or misunder• standing of the figure represented: thus Poseidon and Athena, under a tree, could be taken for Adam and Eve.74 But for the most part these stones were used because they were thought to possess special virtues. The Alexandrian lapidaries, both Hermetic and Gnostic-themselves derived from Egyptian and Chaldean sources-recorded the magic effects of stones bearing represen• tations of divinities. Ptolemy himself was thought to have composed a Liber de impressionibus imaginum in gemmis. These varied traditions were trans•

mitted, directly or indirectly, to the Middle Ages: Picatrix combines several of them. But long before his day, belief in the power of engraved stones was very general. Since the art of glyptics had been lost at an early date--between the second and third centuries A.D.--such images were no longer made; ,.. but ancient gems corresponding in color and subject to the prescriptions of the lapidaries continued to be used as talismans. It is not till the end of the thirteenth century, however, that the treatises make the action of the stars responsible for the properties which they attribute to gems.76 To be sure, as Marbod of Rennes says,
• . • Nul sage homme doter ne dou Ken pirres granl vertus ne soit.T7
But for the most part these Yirtues are regarded as being of a medical nature only; so, in his day, old Isidore, speaking "de lapidihus insignoribus," 78 had been at special pains to share none of the "pagan superstitions" on the subject. On the other hand, and especially during the renaissance of the twelfth century, men who were true humanists made discerning selection-for reasons of taste, or perhaps because of some special personal appropriatenessof gems bearing images of the gods.78 But in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, it is unmistakably as amulets that they are used, and in a distinctly religious spirit. The ferment of diabolism has regained all its old virulence, and the "astrolatry" expressly recommended by Picatrix takes us back to the time of Apuleius--to the days of incantation and sacrifice offered to the astral divinities. *

was it leading Europe back to one of the most demoralizing forms of idolatry, but by representing the various religions and the earthly appearance of their founders as dependent upon the stars, it ranked Christianity on a level with the other faiths and seemed to foreshadow its decline. And, in fact, the Church did react. Even though, as we have seen, she had conceded the principle of astrology, and had not rooted it out, she understood the extent of the danger. This reaction, which can be detected as early as the twelfth century,'° was later to be carried at times to the point of utmost rigor. We need only recall Cecco d'Ascoli's expiating at the stake the crime of having calculated the date of the birth of Christ by means of the stars. Such examples might instill terror; they did not arrest the e,il. The dangerous impetus that astrology had gained in the thirteenth century was accen• tuated in the fifteenth and sixteenth. Here, again, the Renaissance was to prove a continuation of the Middle Ages. We shall not repeat in this connection all that Burckhardt has shown us in a classic work: 81 never since antiquity had the science of the stars been rated more highly or played a greater role in the lives of states or individuals. The great Cinquecento popes alone may serve as examples-Julius II basing the date of his coronation on the calculations of the astrologers, as Paul III did the hour of each consistory, or Leo X founding a chair of astrology at the Sapienza which was to rival similar foundations at the universities of Bologna, Padua, and Paris.82 Here we see to what extent the Church, or at least the Vatican, yielded to the prevailing superstition. It is of course true that at the same time profound intellectual forces were at work which were one day, with Copernicus and Galileo, to lead far beyond the astrological concept of the universe, and to liberate science from magic. But it would he a mistake to view this development as the logical result of a more profound and enlightened culture. On the contrary, the first effect of humanism was to encourage astrology. The precursors of humanism, men like Petrarch and Salutati, still maintained
80 According to Thorndike (op. at. n, pp. 11 The Ci.Uizati.on of the Renai&sance in Italy,

the end of the eleventh century. 82 Boll-Ber.old, op. cit. p. 36.



58 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
the orthodox and reserved attitude of Dante and Thomas Aquinas.83 As time went on, however, and profane learning gained ground, the harriers within which the Middle Ages had attempted to confine it were steadily weakened. Drawn in large part from the literature and philosophy of late antiquity, the new studies confirmed the astrological concept of causality in a thousand new ways.84 This concept ended by penetrating all natural philosophy, just as it had formerly sustained the great intellectual structures of the encyclopedists and theologians. It continued to dominate physics and the other natural sciences. The notion of the intimate bond between microcosm and macrocosm, for instance, remained basic to the art of medicine. Paracelsus, following Marsilio Ficino, proclaims that "the physician must have knowledge of man's other kalf, that half of his nature which is bound up with astronomical philosophy; otherwise he will be in no true sense man's physician, since Heaven retains within its sphere half of all bodies and of all maladies.".., In fact, in order to account for the origin of syphilis and the ravages of the disease, physicians invoked the baleful conjunction of Saturn and Mars.88 Attempts were doubtless still made, as in Ronsard's Hymne des astres, to differentiate in this connection between body and soul, the former alone being subject to astral influence:
Les Estoilles ad.one seules se ft.rent dames De tous les corps humains, et non pas de nos ames.
a Petrarch, who jests at the astrologers without being himseU entirely immune, refers to
St. Augustine, Ep,,t. rer. Jamil~ m, 8.-In the De ftJlo et fartuna, Salutati regards the heav• enly bodies as instruments m the hands of God.
84 In fact, it is bect11Ue he is a humanist and Neoplatomst that Marsilio Ficino believes in
astrology: classical anllquity is his guarantor. See, for example, his letter to Rinaldo Ursino,
archbishop of J1orence (Epis1alae [Ven1ce, 1495], m, p. hvi, v.).
80 He adds: "What is a physician who knows nothing of cosmography? He ought, ou the contrary, to have a special auderstand:ing of it, since it is there that all knowledge finds its

But physiology and psychology are inseparable; "temperament" is the unfailing determinant of character. Thus the Renaissance saw no contradiction between astrology and science; rather, the dominion of the heavenly bodies over all earthly things was viewed hy some as the natural law par excellence, the law which assures the regularity of phenomena. For Pomponazzi, it was the very form and pattern of universal determinism."' And though speculation gradually freed itself from the bonds of this natural philosophy--even more tyrannous for the mind than the bonds of theology-this outcome should not he interpreted merely as a victory of experience and exact calculation o,·er superstition. In fact, as Cassirer has shown,88 it was essentially for moral reasons that the humanists :finally rebelled against the tyranny of the stars. In a world system all parts of which are interconnected, with no single creature possessing an existence independent of the cosmos, man·s position is impossibly humiliating. To he sure, the bonds which attach man to the universe are undeniable; but they now cease to he thought of as a form of imprisonment. Marsilio Ficino still adheres to the notion of "superior" powers with dominion over "inferior" beings (the stars sending their influences down toward the earth). Nicholas of Cusa no longer accepts this suhordina• tion of earth to sky; he sees only harmony and correlation, not dependence.89 Paracelsus goes even further; he suggests that the influence may operate in the other direction-from man to the stars, from soul to thing, from the inner world to the outer. "It might he said that Mars has more resemblance to man than man to Mars, for man is more than Mars and the other planets." 00 The decisive word has been spoken: mind is superior to matter."Even where the astrological world picture remains unchanged, a tendency is clearly manifested to create a new place for the individual within the system." 11 This tendency is still more proudly affirmed by Pico della Mirandola. For him, too, acceptance of astrology signifies a reversal of the true order of things--that is, seeing things not so much according to their essence as ac

cording to their worth-and is tantamount to admitting the sovereignty of matter over spirit. Against this, the author of the De dignitate hominis raises his solemn protest. He refuses, so he says, to honor in great men-in thinkers, statesmen, artists-anything other than their humanity. It is not a better star which creates the genius, it is a loftier mind: "Non astrwn melius, sed ingenium melius." And the miracles of the spirit are greater than those of the sky: "Miracula quidem animi .•. coelo majora sunt.""" To attribute the first to the second is to deny and lower rather than rightly to understand them. Thus "the true impulse toward liberation came not from a new concept of nature but from a new concept of man's own worth." Humanist pride arose in opposition to astrology even before new methods of observation and reckoning had advanced far enough to condemn it. However, one grave misunderstanding still persists: fear of the stars does not disappear with these proud declarations. The humanists have re• fused to fetter man to any system of physical causality, to a material principle. But are the heavenly bodies purely material? From the earliest times, as we have seen, they have, on the contrary, been viewed as animated by intelligences (spirits, gods, or demons) who determine their movements, and by more or less malevolent forces. Have the Renaissance philosophers and savants wholly renounced this conception? To be sure, it is rejected in unmistakable terms by a Pomponazzi, who denies that either demoniacal or divine forces can directly usurp power in violation of the natural laws which govem the production of phenomena. World order would be continually compromised if spirits or angels were able, under cover of the heavenly bodies, to exert a direct influence upon nature and man. The attitude of Marsilio Ficino is more typical. He maintains that the stars, if they do influence the body, have no compulsive power over the soul; but at the same time his own inner life is shadowed by fear of Saturn, the sinister ancient who presided over his birth. He knows that he cannot escape

that baleful influence, which condemns him to melancholy. At the most, he can try to turn it into other channels, to use it for good: Saturn, demon of inertia and sterility, is also the presiding genius of intellectual concentration. But even so, Saturn's patronage imposes strict limitations on those to whom it extends, and it is only within these limitations that man is free to shape his personality. This conviction literally obsesses Ficino, and his friends try in vain to distract him from his somber thoughts.03 Thus at the very moment when great thinkers are striving to throw off the humiliating yoke of the cosmic bodies as such, they tremble before the mysterious divinities which inhabit them. Man proclaims the freedom of the will; but there are other wills stronger than his own, and it is Destiny that prevails. The premature death of Pico della Mirandola, which confirmed the predictions of the astrologers to the day and hour, appeared to his contemporaries like a terrifying denial of his proud assertions... And Luther himself, who scoffed at astrology as irresponsible fantasy, or as an unhealthy and pitiable art, admitted that the awe-inspiring conjunction of several planets in the constellation Pisces which occurred in 1524 was a warning from heaven.96 Outmoded fears of this kind were stubbornly reborn even in the minds of those who thought themselves most completely emancipated. With how much more reason did they persist among those who lacked the support of philosophical meditation, while no longer wholly accepting the assurances of the faith. Men like these turned to magicians, just as their ancestors had done, to conjure away the evil powers. They searched the treatises on magic

for images and formulas with which to placate the astral demons, the very recipes once recommended by astrologers of the thirteenth century. It is from the "Reverend Pere en diable Picatrix, recteur de la faculte diabologique," as Rabelais calls him,"" that Cornelius Agrippa, for example, derives the chapters he devotes to the images of decans and planets suitable to be engraved on talismans; 87 the lapidaries of Camillo Leonardi and Hugues Ragot belong to the same tradition.88 Henri Estienne reports that Queen Catherine de Medicis, whose passion for astrology is of course well known, always carried a gem on which were engraved names of celestial spiritsone side showed Jupiter, to whom Anubis was offering a mirror, and the other Venus, with her planetary symbol. This talisman had been designed and executed by the Sieur Regnier, a famous mathematician and reputed magician in whom she had great confidence.99 At about the same time, Benvenuto Cellini had his horrifying nocturnal vision of the Colosseum S\\ arming with a troop of demons which a necromancer had s.ummoned at his request "in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin." '00 We need not multiply examples of this kind. Still in full force in the sixteenth century, astrology continued to keep alive the veneration for the gods for which it had served as shelter since classical times. Attempts might be made to Christianize or laicize this veneration, to bring it into line with theology or reduce it to a rational theory of universal law; it still bore the imprint of those mythological powers whose names had been preserved by the stars.

THE PHYSICAL TRADITION 63
To Il.LUSTRATE different aspects of this mythology of the hea,·ens and to convince us that the gods survived as sidereal demons, we have at our disposal an extremely rich and curious iconography. We shall investigate later
13. The sun and the zodiac
in our study (pp. 149 ff.) the process by which this iconography took shape in the course of the centuries, and shall try to trace its singular vicissitudes step by step. Here all that we plan to do is to point out a few of the pictorial themes in which medieval and Renaissance ideas of the nature of the gods found expression. How are the gods represented in the cosmology of the Middle Ages?



64 THE SURVIYA.L OF THE PAGAN GODS
Before the twelfth century, we find little by way of illustration of the world systems of which the gods form part beyond an occasional diagram of more or less summary sort. These diagrams are usually circles containing inscribed rosettes, the interlacings of which form symmetrical compartments: each such compartment hears the name of one of the fundamental qualities, of an element, humor, season, etc. At the center we read the name of Man, who is thus shown as surrounded and hemmed in on all sides by the physical universe. It is easy to recognize in this decorative scheme the table of equivalents (supra, p. 47) which, in late antiquity, expressed the correlation and interdependence of all parts of the cosmos.101 The theme of melothesia reappears also, accompanied first by the names and later by the images of the astral deities. As early as the eleventh century a miniature depicts the Sun, a halo of rays about his head, standing at the center of a circular zone made up of the zodiacal signs. Each sign is marked with its own name and the names of the parts of the body which it controls (fig. 13).1.. As the astrological doctrines spread, there is an increase in the number of figures showing the zodiacal symbols distributed over parts of the human body-the Ram on the head, the Fishes under the feet, the Twins grasping the shoulders. In the fourteenth century, this figure is common in calendars; from these it passes to prayer books, where in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it serves as a sort of frontispiece. It appears, for example, on a page of the Tres Riches Heu.res of the Due de Berry.103 But of greater interest for us are the microcosm pictures in which the planets are represented. One of the earliest examples is a miniature in a manuscript in Munich (cod. lat. Monac. 13002) showing man among the

A sort of nimbus surrounds the head, inscribed with the legend, "'Instar celestis spere'' (sic). Thus man's head is, as it were, a small-scale image of the sky. Its roundness expresses the curve of the firmament and its seven orifices correspond to the seven great planetary lights (fig. 14).
Aside from this image, which faithfully reflects the concepts of an Honorius of Autun or a Hildegard of Bingen as to man's relation to the universe,1°' there are others, of later date, in which a new sentiment finds expression.

others, the figure appears alone, tattooed with inscriptions of the names of the planets.105 Elsewhere, as in a most curious miniature in a Copenhagen manuscr1pt,11'" the body is covered with disks, each hearing the image of a planet (fig. 17). These small images have much to tell us on attentive examination.

In place of a frail puppet and a set of summary inscriptions, we are here shown finely developed athletes, surrounded by circling deities who gracefully launch their hostile bolts from the clouds (figs. 18 a, b). But these new pictorial qualities merely clothe the old astro-medical theme. More than a century later, on the ceiling of the astronomical theater of the Archiginnasio at Bologna, Silvestro Giannotti was to carve an array of stellar demigods around the central figure of Apollo 1os Cod.

Illustrations of this type first appear in the fourteenth century, a phenomenon which would of itself suffice to attest the re,ival of astrology at that period, and its popularity. In all astrological calculations the planets are of course the predominant factor. Yet up to this date they have held only a relatively modest place in medieval iconography. In the miniatures decorating astronomical manuscripts they are sometimes met with in the form of busts disposed along the circumference of the sphere, or inscribed in small medallions.111 From the fourteenth century on, the planPts are not only found more frequently in manuscript paintings, but they are revived in Italy in monumental cycles as well. In Venice, they appear on the Gothic capitals of the Doge's Palace (fig. 21); in Padua, among the grisailles frescoed by Guariento in the choir of the Eremitani; in Florence, on the Campanile of Santa Maria del Fiore (fig. 63), where they occupy the second zone of bas-reliefs, just above the legendary heroes, inventors of the arts, whom we studied in the preceding chapter. Also, in Santa Maria Novella we see them ornamenting the backs of the thrones occupied by the allegorical figures of the arts in the Cappella degli Spagnuoli (fig. 22). And in the first years of the fifteenth century, Taddeo di Bartolo represents, in the vault leading to the Chapel of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, four mythological divinities, among them Apollo, Mars, and Jupiter (fig. 42). It must be admitted that in these great cycles, as w~ll as in the contemporary miniatures, the gods often take on unwonted aspects-aspects so strange, indeed, that there has sometimes been hesitation in identifying them. They are unmistakably themselves, however, even in the most unexpected disguises,1'" and they are once more beginning to exercise their powerful patronage over humanity. It is they who determine the humors, the aptitudes, the activities of those born under their influence-and this idea, also, receives visual expression. Each planetary divinity presides, so to speak, over an assemblage of persons disposed beneath it in series or groups. These are its "children," whose vocations it has determined. Thus, Mercury presides

over an assemblage of painters, writers, and merchants. Schematic repre• sentations of this sort, which first took shape in the late Middle Ages,110 bore fruit in the :fifteenth century in a whole family of images, often as beautiful as they are curious. We may cite the illustrations of the Epitre d'Othee of Christine de Pisan,m where the "children" resemble the Apostles receiving the gifts of the Holy Spirit; the frescoes in the Borgia apartments of the Vatican ( figs. 23, 24); and a whole series of en• gravings and drawings in which the planets are usually shown riding in chariots, as in the trionfi of Petrarch. Among these, in Florence, are the prints of Baldini, of which two versions exist, and which inspired the frescoes in the Cam• bio in Perugia; and, in Germany, the Berlin Blockbuch, also the Hausbuch belonging to Prince Waldhurg-WolfeggWaldsee at Wolfegg, and a

But not in all cases are we dealing merely with the spreading of a common superstition by means of the visual image; sometimes an original work is born of the encounter between artist and scholar-an encounter which may be especially significant when one is of the South and another of the North. This was the case with Albrecht Diirer's Melencolia. This famous :figure is, in

fact, an isolated example of the type of subject which we are discussing; she symbolizes the contemplative life of the "children of Saturn," who, obedient to the laws of their star, meditate gloomily and at length on the secrets of wisdom. Diirer, as penetrating studies have shown,111 took his inspiration for this work from a distinguished humanist-none other than Marsilio Ficino himseli.
111 See E. Panofsky and F. Sul, DiJrer•

Lastly, we find the "children of the planets" in two ,·ast Italian fresco cycles which constitute a different category, since they incorporate our theme in a complete cosmological ensemble. The first of these series decorates the Palazzo della Ragione in Padua, more commonly known as ''il Salone." The

upper part of the immense fresco which covers the walls of this hall is divided into horizontal zones. These show us, from the lowest to the highest, first the planets and their "children"; then the signs of the zodiac, with the twelve Apostles 118 and the Labors of the Months. Although later restorations make it difficult to judge, the orientation of the hall is apparently such that each month the beams of the rising sun would strike the zodiacal sign which

system is thus presented in the Salone: the zones correspond to the concentric spheres enveloping the earth, within which reign the ordering forces of the cosmos. In the frescoes of the Palazzo Schifanoia, in Ferrara, we find an analogous disposition. Here we have three horizontal bands: the topmost shows not the planetary gods, but the twelve great gods of Olympus ("masters of the months," as Manilius calls them), each mounted on a chariot and surrounded by his "children"; in the central band appear the signs of the zodiac, and the decans (each controlling ten days of the month•) ; finally, in the lowest band, we see the pastimes and

occupations of Duke Borso at different seasons of the year-in other words, a sort of illustrated chronicle or calendar of the life of palace, court, and city.120 Here, again, the three superposed zones are merely the projection of a spherical system (fig. 25), of which the lowest zone, the earth, forms the nucleus or core.121 These two great fresco cycles--one ornamenting a public palace and the other a princely dwelling, but both bringing together, in an astonishing synthesis with familiar scenes and episodes of daily life, figures of the sidereal demons drawn from antique and often from barbaric sources 12"-are essential documents for any true estimate of the place of astrology in the fifteenth century. They are the exact and full translation in visual terms of a concept of the universe in which the pagan gods have regained the place of cosmocrats (icoaμ.oKpa-tops,;), of sovereign masters. But even in ecclesiastical buildings, there appeared in Italy at about the same time astrological representations of an entirely new significance. In the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo in Florence, and again in the Pazzi Chapel at Santa Croce, it may surprise the visitor to :find, just above each altar, a cupola containing mythical figures of constellations (fig. 27). We have to do here, as has been proved,123 with a type of antique decoration already revived by the Arabs.'... But what is remarkable about the Florentine cupolas is that they represent no merely random arrangement of the stars: the artist

magic of wlucb we have already spoken <see
sapra, pp. 541f.). Outside the astrological cycle, we sometimes meet with one of the gods conceived of and repusented as a chabobcal
being. A noted example is the Cupid painted

has preserved the aspect of the sky exactly as it appeared at a ghen day and hour. Why was this done? Without the slightest doubt, because some event of decisive importance for the Church had taken place at that very moment-an event over which the celestial powers then above the horizon had presided. Aby Warburg was able, in fact, to prove that the arrangement of the stars shown in the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo corresponds exactly to their posi

tions in the sky above Florence on July 9, 1422, the date of the consecration of the main altar."" These astral bodies which the Church welcomed into her sanctuaries were later, as we need hardly remind ourselves, to invade the palaces of her popes. The zodiac, the constellations, the planets, play a curiously prominent pan in the decoration of the Vatican. To cite only one example, the vault of the Sala dei Pontefici, in the Borgia apartments, decorated by order of Leo X, shows the names of Peter's successors surrounded by celestial symbols; above Boniface IX, Cygnus is seen in flight between Pisces and Scorpio, while in medallions at each side Mars and Jupiter ride past in chariots.

And finally, the most radiant period of the Italian Renaissance crystallized in two celebrated works the visual and spiritual elements of this great astro-mythological scheme. Both works were executed at the dawn of th~ Cinquecento for an outstanding epicurean and humanist, Agostino Chigi. One is profane in character and the other religious, for one is the vault oi his palace and the other the cupola of his tomb. The hall in the Farnesina Palace where Raphael painted his Galatea,.,, shows us a vault peopled with mythological figures I fig. 29), among whom we recognize at first glance Perseus slaying Medusa, Venus with her doves, Leda and the Gemini. In our instant admiration for Baldassare Peruzzi's decorative fantasy and for the skillful distribution of his vivid images in groups and tableaux, we may not at first grasp the connection between this ensemble and the astrological cycles with which we have been dealing. What, in fact, do these noble deities, moving through the serene heights of the ether with an elegance that reminds us of Ovid, have in common with the earthbound demons of the realistic Paduan and Ferrarese frescoes, or with the schematized sky plan of the Florentine cupolas? However, the two central scenes of the Peruzzi vault are set against a background of starry sky. What does this indicate if not that here, again, astrology alone can provide the key? And, in fact, careful analysis has shown that precise scientific data underlie the choice and arrangement of the figures " 0--so precise indeed that they have made possible a reconstruction of the corresponding sky map (fig. 26), which astronomical calculations have shown to be identical with the aspect of the sky of Rome on December 1, 1466 -the very day of Agostino Chigi's birth.= Thus the same fateful powers hold vigil here, disguis~d in the iridescent garments of Fable. But now they herald the destiny of an individual, who owes his fortune and glory to their favor: Fame, as she sounds her trumpet among the stars of the vault, publishes the fact triumphantly. Whenever he

28. God and the planet&
conclusions as to Agostino Chigi's "paganism." Rather let us turn to Santa Maria del Popolo-to the chapel where he rests for all eternity. There another aspect of his thought is revealed. In the cupola, against the blue and gold mosaic background, the divine forms of the planets come again into view, ranged in a circle according to the order of the spheres (fig. 28). But this time they are not alone; an angel hovers over each, while surmounting the whole, in the round central aperture, the Creator appears in imperious pose, his arm raised in a gesture at once of benediction and command.

contemporary te"i:ts. In hi~ "sacred hymns" the poet-astrologer Lorenzo Bonincontri addresses the Eternal Father in terms which make His pre-eminence clear:
Te duce, effulgent Joi-is astra coelo, Reddis et clarum Veneri nitorem, Atque Fortunam i·ariare cogis lnfima summis."'"
Even more explicitly, Bonincontri elsewhere explains God's intent, in creating the stars, to make them His auxiliaries and agents ("'ministras executricesquel") in the government of the sublunary world:
Principia Pater omnipotens, ut legibus orbem Flecteret. ..• Sublimes caelo statuit stellasque globosque Errantum: quibus et numeros et nomina fin:;ci.t, .1\/aturamque illis praefecit, ut omnia certis Temporibus mu;n,do starent . . .
His hominum finxit mores, et corpora, et omnem Fortunam, et casus vari.os, i•itamque, diemque E:xtremum, fati seriem finemque laborum . . •1""
Thus, the stars which determined Chigi's death, after having regulated the whole course of his life, did no more than to execute the decrees of Providence. But it is in the Urania of Pontano that the best commentary may he found on the half-pagan, hall-Christian composition of the Cappella Chigi. The celebrated episode of the Assembly of the Gods, in fact, furnishes an exact parallel. The Eternal Father, when about to create inferior beings subject to mortality, convokes in the empyrean a gathering of the most noble beings, who are to be His collaborators. The motivating Intelligences of the seven spheres approach Him-the seven planetary numina, each bearing attributes (as in the Cappella Chigi) suggestive of the zodiacal signs in which

He ceases to speak, and with a nod sets Olympus in motion. Each god leaps into his chariot and speeds toward the allotted task. The poem accords so perfectly with the Chigi cupola that it might almost be a direct description of it. And without doubt Pontano himself was inspired by a recollection of Plato, who in the Timaeus assembles a council of a:x,μ.ove; around the Demiurge.133 But his primary concern was to integrate the principles of astrology with Christian dogma. This reconciliation of science with theology, of Providence with necessity-this balancing of two universes, so anxiously striven for by Renaissance thought-is here on a sudden, for one brief moment, realized. But art alone ,.. has achieved the miracle-the art of Pontano and Raphael. By some special magic the pagan and the sacred, sensual grace and metaphysical grandeur, are blended here in an exquisite and tranquil light.

ing had been so strictly scient!lic and pagan as to exclude all possibility of a theological concept of the universe, attempted toward the end of his life to introduce a religious correctlve into !us doctrine.

The :\Ioral Tradition
T
H E :M E T H o D of interp1 etation which consists in endowin~ mythology with edifying meaning goes back at least as far as the Stoics.· Their great desire to reconcile philosophy "';th popular religion led not only to their attempt, which we have already noted, to regard the gods as symbols of the physical world; they also undertook at times to discover spiritual significance in the figures and even in the names of the gods, and moral lessons in their adventures. At :first glance, this undertaking would seem to have had small chance of success; the Olympians, by and large, were anything hut models of virtue. The story of their orgies and cruelties, their incests and fornications, is thoroughly unedifying. It was for this very reason that the exegesis of the Stoics was both legitimate and necessary. It went without saying that Homer, who recounted all these disgraceful acts of the gods, was a great and noble poet. Could he conceivably have told such impious tales without some hidden intent? No, the thing is manifestly impossible;• we must therefore make every elfort to understand his real meaning when he speaks of the gods-to distinguish between the literal and the deeper meaning. The :first may be frivolous hut the second has weight, and it is the second meaning which is the true one.

l "If Homer was not spealc;ng in allegorical 8~
terms," says Heraclides, "he lfllS guilty of the greatest impieties." It therefore follows that
Homer must have used allego,y. See R. Hinks,

THE JtORAL TRADITION 85
Thus the allegorical method came into being.° We find it systematically applied, at the end of the pagan era, in two small treatises-the Homeric Allegories of Heraclitus, and Phornutus' Commentary on the .Vature of the Gods.• From them we learn that the manly attributes of Mercurius Quadratus signify the fullness and fecundity of reason,5 and that the Harpies who rob Phineus of his food are courtesans devouring the patrimony of young men.• The Neoplatonists revive the same method, but they use it on a broader scale and in a different spirit. They apply it not only to Homer but to all religious traditions, including foreign cults; the entire universe is for them nothing but a great myth, endowed with spiritual meaning. Their attitude is no longer one of rationalization, aimed at explaining away shocking absurdities; it is the attitude of behe,ers and mystics, reverently seeking the depths of meaning within a sacred text. One example is Sallust, friend of the Emperor Julian, who in his treatise On the Gods and the World 1 fervently defends mythology, the true meaning of which, he declares, is apparent only to the initiate. As proof he deliberately selects fables of the grossest surface immorality-the tale of Saturn devouring his children, or of Attis and Cybele. In the latter, for example, he pro,·es by analysis of the myth and the ritual that we are to see "the trials of the soul in its search for God." 8 Without losing anything of their value as a source of religious emotion, these legends which Cicero and Seneca scorned as ''absurdities" and "old wives' tales" • are thus given pious and philosophical explanation, bir!c,i,; Kai ,;;ci..0~6,;;c,i,;,1" The weakness of this system of interpretation is obvious: to look for ideas in old images which are no longer understood is to falsify the character

of the primitive myths." Still, there is much that the Hellenistic philosophers could ha...-e brought forward by way of excuse. for they did not, after all, in• vent allegory out of whole cloth. To say nothing of recent myths, invented or at least elaborated consciously, like the Psyche story, the old legends had long been charged with spiritual elements. Already purified by Homer, they were further ennobled, from Aeschylus to Plato, by sening as themes for poets and philosophers. The gods were no longer elementary beings, "barely detached from the world themselves, covered with soot and with smoke"; nor were they the light and quarrelsome troop of Olympus. Like the statues in the temples, they had come to represent, for the loftiest spirits, magnificent metaphors--signs or steps along man's way to an understanding of the nature of dfrinity." There were still other reasons for this leaning toward allegorical interpretation-the taste of antiquity for apologues hiding a moral within a tale, and above all the tendency, shared by Greeks and Romans alike, to personify abstractions. For those who gave divine form and dignity to Health, Victory, Fortune, Concord, and Modesty, it was not difficult to recognize the same qualities in the goddesses of Fable:
Jfinen:e est la Prudence, et Venus la Beaute."'
Virgil's mythology is interesting in this connection, in a dual sense. In the host of malevolent deities who throng the vestibule of Hades," we recogniz.e Discord, Care, and avenging Remorse side by side with monsters of earlier ages, the Gorgons and Titans. In the Aeneid, furthermore, the Olympians have taken on a dignified and grave look; Virgil refuses to repeat the frivolous tales about them which Ovid so enjoys collecting. Their attitude inspires respect: Jupiter presides over his council with sovereign majesty,

THE MORAL TRADITION 87
and Venus herself is only a mother who fears for her son.1" Just as he deifies moral concepts, Virgil "moralizes" the gods. Mistaken though it was in principle, and often made ridiculous by abuse, the allegorical method thus had its own justification; in their inability to recognize clearly defined periods in the history of the gods, the philoso• phers were rediscovering elements introduced into m1thology by earlier philosophers; they perceived reflections of a wisdom like their own. Furthermore, as we have said, the allegorical method had a very definite raison rI'etre: for many who wished to keep the religion of their fathers it offered a means of giving that religion new life and of bringing it into line with the modem conscience.
*
ON Tms last account, it might he supposed that Christianity could not have shown itself anything hut hostile to allegory. In pagan hands, was it not a defensive weapon of the greatest value? By endowing mythology with lofty spiritual significance, Julian, for eJCample, was shielding it from attack by the Christians, who could no longer claim moral superiority for their own religion. And some voices were indeed raised from among the Church Fathers to contest these interpretations, "which disguise some shameful and miserable error under color of imparting a profound truth." ''We are told," St. Augustine exclaims, "that through the myths the small number of initiates were taught to he virtuous; show me the places--or at least remind me of them.where the people received such lessons!",.. But how could the Fathers con• demn without qualification a method which they themselves made use of at every turn? To say nothing of the parables, which are an essential part of the

tradition of Christian teaching, the patristic tendency always to look for profound meanings hidden behind the words of the Scriptural narrative is a matter of common knowledge.r This tendency is seen first in the Greek Fathers, who owe it to their Alexandrian antecedents. Thus, according to Origen i and to many other commentators in his wake) the Bride and Groom in the Song of Songs represent the Church and Christ.,s But from Alexandria the allegorical spirit invaded the ~estem Church as well. The same type of exegesis is founi:I. in St. Ambrose, and in Prudentius, famed as the author of the Psychomachia, in which the ,ices and ,·irtues are personified.19 But this was not all: for didactic purposes the Fathers often used moralizing interpretations (e,·en in the case of mythology) in no way different from those employed by their opponents. They had, in fact, reluctantly admitted profane poetry into the curriculum, since they recognized it as one of the elements of culture."" Was it thinkable that an educated man should know nothing of Homer or Virgil? But in giving his pupils an understanding of the poets, would not the teacher ine,itably have to tell them "the scandalous history of Olympus, explain the attributes of the gods, and reveal their genealogy in all its aspects"? "" In this delicate task, allegory was a great resource. It is easy to believe that Christian teachers of the fourth century gladly welcomed the pagan allegorizing commentaries, like those of Servius on Yirgil and Lactantius Placidus on Statius' Thebaid. By these means, it was felt, the gods were being reduced to the level of mere ornaments. Indeed, simply to read of their adventures in school did not seem enough; mythological subjects were taken as themes for compositions. Two centuries after Christianity had become the state religion, topics proposed to young men for literary exercises still included speeches by

Thetis or Juno, or the denunciation of a blasphemer guilty of taking a statue of Diana, the virgin goddess, into a house of ill fame.22 By the same token. mythology is still present as a harmless but indispensable ingredient in the panegyrics of Claudian 23 and the elegies of Ausonius.°' Two allegorical monuments mark the beginning of the sixth centuryone dealing with the Bible, the ldoralia of Gregory the Great,05 the other with the pagan gods, the Mythologiae of Fulgentius."" In the latter work, "the reader is awe-struck by the acumen of a mind which refers the whole series of fables, philosophically explained, either to the natural order or to man's moral life.""' Side by side with physical interpretations, Fulgentius does in fact advance explanations of an edifying sort: thus the three goddesses among whom Paris must choose become symbols of the acth-e, the contemplative, and the amorous life (II, 1) ; the union of Leda and the Swan typifies the coupling of Power and Injustice--tbe fruits of such a union being, like Helen, inevitable objects of scandal and discord III, 16). Gregory of Tours was clearly aware of the dangers inherent in this method, which, under pretext of derhing moral teaching from the pagan fables, actually perpetuated their memory: "Let us have no more of the gods," he said, "and tum rather to the Gospel." 23 But these wise counsels remained without effect.

90 THE ST.:Rnr.4.L OF THE P.-lG.4.S GODS
Allegoriae in unfrersam sacram scripturam of Rahanus Maurus, appeared a poem by Theodulph, bishop of Orleans, on how to interpret the fables of the poets ''philosophically":
Falsa poetarum stilus affert, iera sophorum
Falsa horum in t·erum 1-ertere saepe solent ..
He continues by interpreting Proteus as Truth, Hercules as Virtue, Cacus as the bad thief, and comments on the attributes of Cupid in these terms:
Mens prai·a in pharetra, insidiae signantur in arcu. Tela, puer, tirtJ,S, fax tuus ardor, Amor .....
Thus mythology tends to become a philosophia moralis (.so titled in an eleventh-century work attributed to Hildehert of Lavardin. hi.shop of Tours, who draws many examples from the pagan poets, as well as from the Bible).31 It even tends to become reconciled with theology: the medieval genius for allegory which, renewing the tradition of the Fathers,30 finds anticipations of the New Covenant in Old Testament characters and episodes, and sees certain characters and episodes of Fable as prefigurations of Christian truth. In fact, beginning with the twelfth century, when allegory became the universal vehicle of all pious expression, mythological exegesis in this sense grew to astonishing proportions. It was in this period that Alexander Neckam 33 related the gods to those virtues which, according to St. Augustine, had

Above all, it was at this period that the ,l[etamorphoses of Ovid were exploited as a mine of sacred truth. The earliest Christian centuries had sho¥.n themselves hostile to <hid, for the very reason that his work seemed much more difficult to reconcile with philosophy and theology than did that of the graver Virgil.'" The first indication of a change of attitude is given us by Theodulph, the bishop of Orleans whom we have already quoted. In (hid's works, he says, although there is much that is frivolous, even more truth lies hidden under a false covering:

His authority is inrnked. for instance. to prove such propositions as this: ''De summa dei potentia et voluntatis eius efficacia" ("The supreme power of God and the efficacy of his will'"}. In another collection of edi.f)ing texts ·• we come, surprisingly enough, upon a set of extracts from the Jletamorphoses interpreted for use by nuns. As a crowning touch. the goddesses are represented as being nuns themselves. The gods are the clergy, and their marriages are the meetings of monks and nuns:

But other explanations of the l'lhole of the ,lletamorphoses appear, becoming increasingly numerous." Examples are the prose commentary by Arnolphe of Orleans, and the Integumenta, in verse, by John of Garland.'" But the most important example is furnished us by the mammoth poem known as the Odde moralise, composed in or near the first years of the fourteenth century 43 by an anonymous author who has sometimes been identified with Philippe de Vitry, bishop of Meaux, and sometimes with Chrestien Legouais de Sainte-Maure. Here the allegorical principle is clearly formulated. In the Metamorphoses, the author declares, instruction may be derived from everything:
Tout est pour nostre enseignement.

are the vanities of this world; the peacock is the vainglonous mortal who flaunts them; Diana is the Trinity; Actaeon, Jesus Christ. Phaethon represents Lucifer and his revolt against God. Ceres looking for Proserpina is the Church seeking to recm er the souls of the faithful who have strayed from the fold. Her two torches are the Old and Xew Testaments; the child who insults her and whom she transforms into a lizard is the Synagogue... To the same century belong the Allegorie on Ovid of Giovanni del Yirgilio; 45 the Moralia super Ovidii :Uetamorphoses of the Dominican Robert Holkott; the Reductorium morale of the Benedictine Pierre Bersuire, who "moralizes" Ovid in his fifteenth book, and who states that he is interested solely in the edifying teachings of Fable; .. the Metamorphosis Oi·idiana moraliter explanata of Thomas Waleys; the Allegorie ed esposizioni delle metamorphosi of Giovanni dei Bonsogni, etc. Two fifteenth-century commentaries of special interest must be added to these. One, known as the "Copenhagen Commentary;' follows one of the manuscripts of the great Ot'ide moralise; " the other accompanies the French translation of the Ovide moralise from Bersuire's Reductorium morale--a translation printed in Bruges in 1484 by Colart Mansion. The two commentators make clear their intention from the start: they wish to explain the moral meaning of the fables, since "l'omme doit de toutes choses tyrer sapience et mettre a prouffi.t pour lui et pour les autres en incitant a honnes moeurs et fuyant ,·ices."" They justify their plans by showing that the Bible authorizes moralization, and that Christ himself made use of parables. Thus far we have seen nothing particula1ly new; but as Jeannette van't Sant has discerningly remarked:' it sometimes happens that the author of the Commentaire strays from moral interpretation into the realm of social criticism.

In contrast, Saturn, Jupiter, and Apollo upon occasion represent the virtuous ecclesiastic••.\s £or Juno, she remains the incarnation of the Church. We must treat as a special case the Franciscan John Ridewall, who in the middle of the fifteenth century composed a mythological treatise purporting to be a renewal of Fulgentius,"'' hut actually drawing upon the most divergent sources-classical and postclassical authors, the Bible and the Fathers, the encyclopedists and theologians. The chapter sequence is determined by the identification of gods with Virtues. Saturn is Prudence, and since Prudence is made up of Memory, Intelligence, and Foresight, Ridewall next treats of Saturn's children: Juno-Memoria, Neptune-Intelligencia, Pluto• Pro,idencia; and finally of Jupiter-Benevolencia, who sums up Prudentia, Sapientia, and Intelligencia. To Pluto are subordinated Cerberus-Cupiditas and Proserpina-Beatitudo. Similarly, Apollo is Truth; Danae, Modesty; Perseus, Courage, etc. The detailed working out of this allegorical analysis is carried to fantastic extremes. For instance, Juno, as we have seen, is identified with :Memory, and therefore has the following attributes: she is veiled, crowned with a rainbow, and perfumed; she holds a scepter, is hound by a golden chain, surrounded by peacocks, etc.61 (fig. 30). All these details are explained by the very fact that the goddess represents memory. Memory does, of course, keep alive the recollection of sin: hence the veil behind which Juno may hide her shame. The recollection of sin leads to repentance, and thus to reconciliation v.ith God: this explains the rainbow, sign of divine forgiveness. Reconciliation gives birth to spiritual consolation, which fills the soul with rapture: hence the perfumes. And having, by virtue of Memory, attained repentance and reconciliation, the soul in its new state of blessedness regains that mastery of itself which sin had caused it to lose: hence the scepter, etc."' The extraordinary ingenuity of the commentary is ap

parent, especially when we consider that each interpretation rests upon at least one supporting authority-Cicero, St. Augustine, or Bernard of Chartres. This is without doubt our most curious monument of the application of Christian allegory to mythology.

RABELAIS' ironic verdict on the allegorizers, in the prologue of Gargantua, is well known: "Croiez vous en vostre foy qu'onques Homere, escrivant l'Iliade et Odysee, pensast es allegories lesquelles de luy ont calfrete Plutarche, Heraclides, Ponticq, Eustatie, Pharnute, et ce que d'iceulx Politien a desrobe? Si le croiez, vous n'approchez ne de pieds ne de mains a mon opinion, qui decrete icelles aussi peu avoir este songees d'Homere, que d'Ovide en ses Metamorphoses les Sacremens de l'Evangile."""

It is readily assumed that most of Rabelais' contemporaries shared this attitude of his. In fact, one of the essential differences usually said to exist between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance has to do with this very matter. Whereas the medieval cult of ancient literature was not disinterested, but

looked to the classics for moral sustenance and studied them only in their ·•Christian" aspects... the Renaissance, free from such scruples, is thought to have looked on classical literature as a source of pleasure, aesthetic as well as sensuous. As a logical consequence, it must have wished to banish allegory, which hid or disguised the real figures of the gods. In reality, when examined more closely •' this traditional distinction is seen to rest on exceedingly insecure foundations. Again we have confirming evidence. First of alL the jeers of Rabelais were no more effective than the diatribes of Luther '" in checking the vogue for ..moralizations" of Ovid. Already numerous in France and Italy•• at the beginning of the century, toward its close they had spread over all of Europe.58 This should by no means be interpreted as the survival of an exclusively popular tradition. As we are about to see, the humanists themselves had not abandoned the search for hidden meanings in the literature of Fable, and this despite their direct and familiar contact with antiquity--or should we perhaps say because of that very contact? For the ancients whom they interrogated so passionately were in many cases the last representatives of paganism, the most extreme exponents of mythological exegesis. and in particular of the allegorical method.•• It is from Heraclitus, Phornutus, the pseudo Plutarch (as Rabelais quite rightly observes) that Politian •'purloins" his interpretations of Homer. The mention of Politian, indeed, opens up a fruitful path of inquiry. This eminent "allegorizer" was close to the circle of Quattrocento Platonists grouped about Marsilio Ficino, leading spirit of the famous Academy whose membership included a number of exegetes bent upon extracting profound

truths from myth and Fable. Cristofaro Landino refuses to think of the creations of the poets as mere flights o:f the imagination, and discovers the secrets o:f wisdom in Virgil; Caelius Rhodiginus sees Kronos as the Dh·ine Intelligence, and the struggle between Ares and Pallas as the combat between Pa!I• sion and Reason. It has even been thought that Ficino himself was author of a treatise which scrutinizes the inner meaning of the Golden Fleece and the legends associated with it.'" It is certainly in this milieu that the headquarters of allegory in the fifteenth and the early part of the sixteenth century must be sought. Indeed, what could he more natural? The humanists saw Plato through the eyes o:f Porphyry, lamhlichus, and Proclus, all three of whom. as edited by Ficino, assumed extraordinary prestige in their eyes. With such persuasive examples before them, they believed that in systematically exploring mythology in search of concealed meanings they were applying the master's own method: "universam poesim aenigmatum esse plenam docet Plato." Let us note in passing that when the humanists had once begun trying to read the riddles hidden beneath the smface of fable, they were tempted to implant ideas of their own there in tum. The pagan myths did, in fact, serve as vehicle for the philosophical thought of the Renaissance. When Lorenzo Valla treats of free will. he symbolizes dhine prescience by Apollo, omnipotence by Jupiter."' Later, under the influence of the Florentine Academy, Charles de Bouelles breathed new life into the ancient theme of Prometheus-in this case reverting to pure Platonic tradition, the tradition of Protagoras."" The lesser scholars and poets proceeded to "Platonize" in the same sense. A Dorat, for example, was not satisfied with showing his disciples that Homer was in reality a moralist:

He further taught them the necessity of concealing truth beneath the mantle of myth, and how to do it:
••• Comment On doit feindre et cacher les /ables proprement,
Et a bien deguiser la T:erite des choses D'un fabuleux manteau dont elles sont encloses."'
But in the light of Neoplatonism, the humanists discovered in mythology something other and much greater than a concealed morality: they discO\·ered religious teaching-the Christian doctrine itself. Interpretation by means of symbols, in fact, made it possible not only to discern a lofty wisdom beneath fictions of the most diverse character and the most unedifying appearance: it further led to a grasp of the fundamental relationship between this profane wisdom (variable in its outward form, but immutable in its teaching) and the wisdom of the Bible. Just as Plato accords with Moses,.. and Socrates "confirms" Christ,.. so Homer's voice is that of a prophet. And the Magi of Persia and Egypt, who in their turn masked sacred maxims under a cloak of Fable, are linked to the sages of Israel.6'' Against this background, it was inevitable that the same idea which declining paganism had evolved as should occur to the humanists-namely, that all religions have the same worth, and that under their varied forms, however puerile and monstrous in seeming, is hidden a common truth. Marsilio Ficino leans toward a sort of universal theism, with Platonism as its gospel."" According to others,'0 the ancient peoples, even including the barbarians, shared from the beginning in the Christian revelation; either it became altered in their hands, or the sages of each nation deliberately disguised it in order to protect it from vulgar profanation. This l'.ill explain certain strange utterances, among them Erasmus' sug

gestion that more profit is perhaps to he derived from reading the literature of Fable with its allegorical content in mind than from the Scriptures taken merely literally: "lmmo fortasse plusculo fructu legetur poetica cum allegoria, quam narratio sacrorum librorum, si consistas in cortice." 11 Or. again, this somewhat disturbing admission of Mutianus Rufus to one of his friends: "Est unus deus et una dea. Sed sunt multa uti numina ita et nomina: Jupiter, Sol, Apollo, Moses, Christus, Luna, Ceres, Proserpina.. Tellus, !\faria. Sed haec cave enunties. Sunt enim occulta silentio tamquam Eleusinarum dearum mysteria. Utendum est fabulis atque enigmatum integumentis in re sacra.""' Thus we may see how far certain humanists were willing to go along this path; they did not stop e~en at heresy. Neoplatonic exegesis, which had presented them with hitherto undreamed-of possibilities of reconciliation between the Bible and mythology, had now so obscured the distinction between the two that Christian dogma no longer seemed acceptable in anything hut an allegorical sense. While it was no doubt best for people as a whole to continue to accept the traditional teachings with naive faith, learned men, with their more enlightened minds, should be able to discern the inevitable part played in Christianity, as in pagan belief, by the weaving of fables.'3

A PARALLEL influence reinforced that of Neoplatonism. In 1419, Cristoforo de'Buondelmonti, a Florentine priest traveling over the island of Andros, bought there a Greek manuscript which he brought back with him to Italy. This was the Hieroglyphica of Horapollo Niliacus, an obscure Alexandrian of the second or fourth century A.D., who claimed in this work to set forth the

hidden meaning of the sacred symbols used in ancient Egypt/• Everyone believed that a real disco\"ery had been made. In reality. all that Horapollo did was to sanction the mistaken ,iew of hieroglyphics which had arisen by way of Apuleius, Plutarch, and Plotinus-namely, that they formed an ensemble of rebuses designed to make religious precepts incomprehensible to the profane. Later, '.\Iarsilio Ficino and his circle showed the greatest enthusiasm for this little treatise, which so admirably confirmed their theories. :'.'.'aturally, they supposed that the great minds of Greece had been initiated into these Egyptian "'mysteries'"-which, in their turn, were of course one more pre• figuration of the teachings of Christ." The Hierogl-,phica played a considerable role both in humanistic thinking and in art.'" The work was printed for the first time by Aldus in 1505, but well before that date it had inspired a chapter of Leon Battista Alberti's De re aedifi.catoria," and had manifestly influenced the illustrations of a fa. mous book, the Hjpnerotomachia Poliphili, or Dream of Poliphilo, by Francesco Colonna."' But Horapollo's example inspired the humanists, above all, to look for some contemporary equivalent of the ancient cryptograms. This equivalent was offered by the emblemata, the prototype of which was provided by Alciati in his first collection. published in 1531."'

it possible to recognize the meaning behind the image. Alciati, of course, borrowed from Horapollo, his model, but he used many other sources as well. He took his texts from the Latin fabulists and historians, especially from ~1artial and the poets of the Amholog'); the epigram, in its sententiou$ brevity, lent itself ideally to his purpose. As for the pictures, aside from a few bizarre figures these represent animals or plants, sometimes human beings, and sometimes, lastly, gods. Mythological characters play a prominent part.80 Leafing through Alciati's Emblematum liber, we find Pan, Bacchus, Juno, Thetis, Minen·a, Hercules, the Graces and Harpies, Scylla and Xiobe, Tantalus and Prometheus, Ganymede, Actaeon, Icarus, ~arcissus, Proteus, etc. The eye dwells on these figures \\ith delight; many of them are charming. But \le must not forget that they have a further function-either to symbolize some vice or virtue or to embody a moral truth. Faunus represents luxuria; Tantalus, avarice; Bellerophon. intelligence and courage overcoming obstacles; Ganymede, the unsullied soul finding its joy in God. Pallas, with the dragon at her side, signifies the virgin's need for strict guardianship and for protection against the snares of Love (Emblema x.w:):
Vera haec effigies innuptae est Palladis: ejus Hie draco, qui dominae constitit ante pedes. Cur dit-ae comes hoc animal? Custodia rerum Huie data: sic lucos, sacraque templa colit. lnnuptas opus est cura assen·are puellas Pervigili: laqueos undique tendzt Amor.81
Venus placing her foot on a tortoise (fig. 39), an image borrowed from Pausanias, teaches that women should remain at home and be chary of speech (Emblema cxcv):

For Alciati's imitators, this figure took on new significance, and was enriched '\\ith new details:
La tortue dit que femme n'aille loing, Le doigt le,:e, qu'a parler ne s'atance, La clef en main denote qu'a,:oir soing Doibt sur /es biens du mary par pruden,ce.c:
Each attribute of Bacchus exhibits one of the harmful effects of intemperance,,. and each of the various aspects of :Mercury conceals some sage maxim." But it is the likenesses of Cupid which offer the emblem-maker the richest material, if not the most varied. One image shows him riding in a chariot drawn by lions which he has tamed, proof that the power of Love is irresistible (CY) ; again, he holds a fish in one hand and flowers in the other, showing that hoth land and sea are subject to the laws of Love {en). Elsewhere ( C\'II) we see lightning expending itself in vain against his weapons and his wings-he is hut made the stronger. Finally, Alciati enumerates and comments critically on the attributes usually assigned to the god by the poets, and tells us how he himself interprets them; he then offers his own description of Love, conforming to the god's true nature."" This theme and its variations, deri,·ed from the Anthology (two of the emblems also portray wounded Love), were certainly thoroughly familiar to the Renaissance academies, where Cupid's arrows, his wings, and his hound eyes were favorite topics of discussion. At this juncture, one may pause in some surprise at the banal character of the emblems. "What!" one may well exclaim, "is there anything mysterious here? Are these subjects profound, these teachings sacred?" The disappointed reader, finding nothing hut commonplaces clothed in transparent dress, begins with good reason to wonder at the presumption which placed such futilities under the patronage of the Sphinx. The truth is that the science of emblems had two contradictory ends in view.88 On the one hand, it did in

deed aim at establishing an esoteric means of expression; on the other, howe,·er, it wished to be didactic, offering lessons which, through their visual presentation, would be within reach of everyone. Its ambition was to be at one and the same time an occult and a popular language. The humanists do not appear to hu·e been disturbed by this contradiction, and unfailingly regarded the emblems as a sublime creation of the human spirit:' It should thus not surprise us that this pseudo science led them. as their pseudo Platonism did, to carry their reconciliation of pagan mythology and Christian teaching to the point where the two were actually merged. In the science of emblems, furthermore, we see the first outlines of a movement which culminated in "the embrace of profane and sacred philosophy." 88 We have already seen Ganymede incarnating the joys of the innocent soul enraptured by God; one of Alciati's glossators even recalls at this point the words of Christ, "Suffer little children to come unto me." 51 But this is not all. Alciati offers us, in addition to a lascivious Cupid, a modest and ,irtuous Cupid (Emblems ax, ex) who symbolizes love of virtue-dhine love. Alexandrian eroticism had been spiritualized and moralized in the same way by opposing 'Avdp(I); to ''Eplll; (figs. 100, 101). But a further step is soon taken: Cupid yields his bow and arrows to the Infant Jesus, who in his tum uses them to pierce human hearts.90

THUS THE GREAT allegorical current of the Middle Ages, far from shrinking, flows on in an ever widening channel. And the gods of the Renaissance are still in many cases didactic figures-instruments for the edification of the soul. Certain later contributions may have rejuvenated mythological allegory in its outward look; they brought to it nothing essentially new.

that they raised and the bold ventures they provoked, brought about any decish·e de\·iation from the medieval tradition-and that for a .-ery simple reason. As a whole, they merely led the humanists hack to the ultimate sources of that tradition. Hence the curious resemblance-sometimes almost amounting to identity-between the mythological ''moralities" of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and those of the twelfth century, or even of the ninth or sixth. The scholar who belie,·ed that he had recovered the secret of the lost wisdom of antiquity was in reality merely returning to the hybrid doctrine that the Fathers had inherited from the last defenders of paganism."' He prided himself on walking in the footsteps of Plato, hut the paths he followed had been well wom since the time of Fulgentius... When Alciati comments on the attributes of Cupid, he echoes the mice of Carolingian scholars. Turning hack to Theodulph we find:
Tel.a, puer, virus, fax tuus ardor, Amor .....
And if the Renaissance transforms Alexandrian eroticism into Christian teaching, such boldness is not new: as we have seen, the Middle Ages read Scriptural meaning into the Metamorphoses, and nuns of the thirteenth century were devout readers of the Ars amatoria. :'.\'Ioral or theological truths disco,·ered beneath the mask of Fable and in the figures of the gods, the fleeting reflection of divine wisdom in profane knowledge-nothing of this had actually been invented by the Renaissance. It was, in the words of Pierre de Nolhac, the "reverie medievale" .. to which the Renaissance had succumbed-the haunting chimera, born on the ruins of paganism, of an impossible reconciliation. The sun·ival of the gods in these different systems of moral allegory is here again confirmed by a wealth of iconographical material from which only a few examples can be chosen. The first century of the Christian era-to go no farther back in time••furnishes us with two convincing illustrations. The delicate stucco reliefs of

the subterranean basilica at the Porta Maggiore in Rome offer eloquent proof of the spirituality with which the ancient mythology had come to he suffused. These genii, bacchantes, and demigods are charged with symbolism. Thus the rape of Ganymede by Jupiter's eagle and that of the daughters of Leucippus by the Dioscuri typify the ascent of the soul to immortality; Marsyas, Agave, the Danaids, on the other hand, image the punishments meted out to ignorance and pride.06 As Carcopino has shown," the decoration as a whole embodies the great esoteric doctrines associated with the Pythagorean sects. Need we recall, moreover, that the Christian art of the catacombs borrowed from mythology the symbolic motif of amorini as vintagers which later caused the Basilica of Constantine to he mistaken for a temple of Bacchus! .,. Similarly, we see the Middle Ages Christianizing, or "moralizing," pagan :figures. In the previous chapter we have remarked upon the singular use made by scholars of gems engraved with likenesses of the gods. They were not always prompted by ignorance or naivete, but sometimes deliberately transformed the meaning of an image by means of a simple inscription. Cupid became the Angel of the Annunciation, and Minerva the Virgin Mary."" But above all, the allegorical treatises in which the attributes of pagan divinities were systematically interpreted in a moral sense gave rise to curious sets of miniatures. Within their moralizing framework, these treatises contained extremely precise and visually clear descriptions--a source of ready inspiration to the illustrator. It is thus, for example, that a Vatican manuscript (Palatinus 1066) has been provided with lively images of Juno, Neptune, Jupiter, Pluto, and Saturn, which, it is true, hear little resemblance

Such descriptions, issuing from the edifying tradition of Fulgentius and :Martianus Capella, and collected, as we shall see later, in mythographical compilations, passed from these sources into literature.

The predilection of Guillaume de Lorris for allegory is well known; furthermore, it was from the Vatican Mythographers I and II 102 that Jean de Meung derived his knowledge of mythology.

The illustrations of the Roman de la Rose themse!Yes reflect the same tendency.103 The gods, for the most part, are indistinguishable in dress and attitude from the noble lords and ladies-and resemble them, also, in that their sole function is to clothe abstractions in lhing and graceful form.

No; three moral ideas, an allegory of Fulgentius.- Similarly, some manuscripts of the Ot•ide moralise (for example, cod. 742 of the Bihliotheque de Lyon) offer us small pictures, ra,ishing in their delicate irony and freshness, but each containing a lesson or sermon tfigs. 33-36).
*
HOWEVER they may differ in outward appearance, certain works of art of the Italian Renaissance are in spirit ,·ery close to our medieval images. In the Louvre are two celebrated representations of the psychomachia in which pagan divinities incarnate the virtues and vices. Both were painted for the young and cultivated duchess of Mantua, Isabella d'Este. One is :Mantegna's Triumph of Wisdom oi;er Vice (fig. 37),1"' where Wisdom appears in the guise of Minerva. Helmeted, shield on arm and lance in hand, escorted by Diana and by Chastity, she puts to rout Venus, mother of all the Vices, who are shown swarming in a stagnant pool-Dalliance (Otia),'08 Sloth, Hate, Suspicion, Avarice. The other is Perugino's Combat of Loie and Clwst~)-""' Here we have a somewhat timid, though exact, rendering of a theme furnished by the court poet Paride da Cesarea: "Our poetic invention, which I greatly desire you to paint, is a battle between Chastity and Lust.. in which Pallas and Diano. shall be shown manfully struggling against Venus and .4mor. . . ." Cesarea advised the artist to introduce other episodes into the background of the painting, showing what happens when Chastity succumbs to Love: the Rape of Europa, Daphne pursued by Apollo, Glaucera and Mercury, Proserpina and Pluto. . • • Fable, in other words, is now merely a repertoire of symbolic figures and moral examples.

112 THE sc:RVffAL OF THE PAGA.\. GODS
Thus, in spite of their classical suggestion and their plastic nudity, these figures, again. are instruments of morality. They take us back, far beyond the :Middle Ages, to the ,·ery sources of mythological allegory: in the combat of the gods in the twentieth book of the llwd, Anaxagoras early discerned a spiritual conflict, the never-ending conflict between the forces of the soul.118
*
ALLEGORICAL EXEGESIS, toward the end of the fifteenth century, was focused chiefly in Florence. As a natural consequence, Florentine art of that period produced great allegorical compositions, rich in inner meaning. Botticelli's divinities come first to mind-his three Venuses and his Pallas.114 Their languid grace and dream-filled eyes haunt the imagination but defy analysis. Painstaking and exact research 11" has thrown light on their origin, on the texts, models, and outward circumstances which brought them into being; nevertheless, their ultimate secret has not yet been penetrated--or rather, their secrets, for it is our belief that they hide several layers of allegorical meaning. First of all, they conceal certain allusions of a personal and private nature, evocations of events prominent in Medici annals 118-the tournament of 1475 in which Giuliano distinguished himself before the "Queen of Beauty," 111 and the return of Lorenzo, which restored peace to Florence after

Artistically impressionable as he was, and open to every influence-disciple of Alberti, emulator of Leonardo--he had to harmonize all these voices as best he could, to reconcile these divergent aims, to crystallize the unco-ordinated emotions arising from all this erudition.

116 THE SURJ'IJlAL OF THE P.-1.GA.'i GODS
Elsewhere,,.,. in his figures of Calumny, Fraud, Ignorance, and Remorse, Botticelli has no difficulty in confining definite concepts and moral ideas within precise contours. But here the same clear-cut and sinuous line is powerless to imprison a subject matter made up of complex ideas and elusive dreams. At the Medici villa of Poggio a Caiano, one of the seats of the Neoplatonic Academy, further enigmas are proposed to the ,·isitor, from the moment of his arrival, by the terra-cotta frieze '09 seen against the blue ground of the pediment. Among these figures, 4(), Prudenti.a exquisite in their grace and their balance, we recognize Apollo and Diana in their chariot; Eternity in her cavern, with souls emerging from her breast; Janus on the threshold of the temple of War. But other scenes have defied explanation, and the meaning of the composition as a whole has not been deciphered. The artist, unquestionably following a program furnished again by Politian or by some other humanist in Lorenzo's court, was evidently charged with concealing in this work some momentous secret from the \\isdom of the ancients. He succeeded only too well in his task.

THE .'.!ORAL TRADITION 117
Let us visit the famous Camera di San Paolo in Parma, painted by Correggio between 1518 and 1519. Our first impression is a completely captivating one: Diana, mighty huntress, with her how and dog; the amorini playing mischievously among the leaves; above all, the ingratiating forms of deities
41. The punishment of Juno
delicately modeled in chiaroscuro-what could be more instantly satisfying to the senses and imagination both? On a more considered view, however, we begin to feel a certain surprise; the choice and arrangement of the supple figures first intrigues, then disturbs us. Many are frankly puzzling, and even if we recognize Adonis or Juno we cannot tell why they are there. And this playful decoration has, in fact, remained an enigma; under its apparent artlessness it conceals a wealth of symbolic intention. This hall once formed part of a convent-more precisely, of the apartments of the abbess, Giovanna da Piacenza. This circumstance would at first



118 THE sr:RrffAL OF THE P.4GAN GODS
appear to deepen the mystery; as a matter of fact, it pro,ides us l'\ith the key. To he sure, a superficial obsen·er might find it "scandalous that subjects from pagan fable should he represented in a monastery of virgins consecrated to Our Lord." 130 But what scandalizes him ought, on the contrary, to reassure him, for these subjects were deliberately suggested to Correggio hy the ahhess -herself a woman of intellect--or by some humanist belonging to her circle,w. for an. edifying purpose. Diana represents Giovanna da Piacenza, guarding her \"irgin flock. The figures of the Vestals, the scenes of libation and sacrifice, teach the nuns their duty. Tranquillity, Fortune, Abundanceallegories drawn from Roman medals--remind them of the advantages of their state. Finally, other images contain salutary warnings: Tellus, scorpion in hand, serves to recall the sad fate of Orion, the proud hunter who boasted of slaughtering the proteges of Diana; Juno, suspended hy her hands, a heavy anvil attached to her delicate feet, as in Homer's account,112 is a reminder of the punishment inflicted on the goddess by the supreme ruler of Olympus for having persecuted Hercules (fig. 41). Possibly these last two themes were meant to impress nuns who might be tempted to forsake their vows, "a coloro che dimentiche delle giurate promesse deviassero mai all'errore." 118 More probably they were intended for the visitor, who is struck by them immediately upon entering. Thus all these delicate charms which we were hut now admiring are spiritual in essence ( "intellettuali hellezze," the Padre .Aft"o calls them) ; each one has its message. Unexpected as the comparison may appear, this hall in a Renaissance convent has more than one trait in common with the first-century basilica that we recently discussed: ""' it is characterized by the same decorative elegance of form, the same underlying gravity of meaning, and the same evocation of sacrifices, rewards, and punishments. This is no arbitrary parallel. The Camera di San Paolo contains an inscription, ••1gnem gladio ne fodias," in which we recognize a Pythagorean adage.""" Although

placed above the fireplace, this inscription should not be taken in its literal sense. It is an allusion to the sacred fire guarded by the Christian vestals. and an admonition against irritating the powerful directress of the establishment.,..., It, too, has the force of a warning. There are, moreover, manifest links between the Camera di San Paolo and the allegorical tradition of the Middle Ages. Three hundred years earlier, as we have seen, nuns found the same precepts of Christian morality and virtue in the fables of Diana and Vesta, piously interpreted:
• . • Obsen·antia vestra Est expressa satis cultu tantae deitatis .
Although perhaps less naive, the learned abbess who had the words Di bene vortant l\Titten at the very door of her convent is worthy to be called their sister. She differs from them in being no longer content merely to interpret enigmas; she composes her own. She thus earns a place among those makers of hieroglyphs whose origin, models, and ambitions we have already discussed.,.. *
Tms PASSION for hieroglyphs with which humanism was so thoroughly impregnated could not fail to leave its traces in the visual arts. The pseudo science of Horapollo and of the "emhlematists" who emulated him did, in fact, provide artists not only with new elements of decoration,,.. but also '\\ith themes for learned allegories. Pintoricchio, Leonardo, Giovanni Bellini, and Diirer had recourse, each in turn, to this source of inspiration.140 We shall pause to mention only a '"hieroglyph" attributed to Titian, which offers special interest in connection with the tradition which concerns us here.

representing three male heads--one seen in fullface, the other two in profile -above three animal heads, dog, wolf, and lion (fig. 40). The painting had been belieYed to represent the three ages of life, although astonishment had been expressed at strange features in the composition. Admittedly, Titian's allegories are not always clear,"" but this six-headed monster is of an unwonted barbarity. In reality, as recent analysis has shown,'.. we have here a curious combination of two symbols. The human heads represent Prudence, in the terms of scholastic moral theology. If we tum to Fulgentius metaforalis, in fact, we find that Prudentia is composed of three faculties-Memoria, Intelligencia, and Praevidentia, whose respective functions are to conserve the past, to know the present, and to foresee the future: "Tripartita perlustrat tempora vitae." 1" Hence the frequent representation of Prudence with a triple headas, for example, in the pavement of the Siena Cathedral."" Thus this first symbol belongs to medieval philosophy and allegory. It remains for us to interpret the second-the three animal heads. For this we must go much farther back in time. In his Saturnal.ia, Macrobius describes a statue of Serapis whose hand rests on a monstrous creature, at once lion, wolf, and dog. Only the three heads are visible, the bodies, which are fused together, being wrapped in the coils of a serpent. "Easque formas animalium draco conectit volumine suo." What is the meaning of this strange attribute? Macrobius himself gives the explanation. '"The lion, violent and sudden, expresses the present; the wolf, which drags away its victims, is the image of the past, robbing us of memories; the dog, fawning on its master, suggests to us the future, which ceaselessly beguiles us with hope." The three ~ymbolic animals are thus the three aspects of Time. It is manifestly this text which inspired Titian.m The text was familiar to the Renaissance humanists. With

their taste for pseudo-Egyptian allegories, they must ha,·e been attracted by the enigmatic character of the monster and by :'.\,facrobius' ingenious explanation. In £act, this signum triceps had already come to light in the Dream of Poliphilo, and was to be seen later by Pierio Valeriano as a perfect model of the "hieroglyph." 147 What seems to us particularly interesting in the painting attributed to Titian is the combination of the two symbols. A moment's thought will show the significance of this synthesis. It blends two images which embody two completely distinct ideas. The first, borrowed from medieval morality, represents the three phases of Time as encompassed in Prudence; these are purely intellectual concepts, personified in human form. The second, issuing from the Oriental cults of the late Empire, depicts Time as a mythical force made up of three ravening beasts. But what does this contrast matter? Humanism is a stream into which Bow all the waters of the past, mingling the most diverse forms and ideas, fusing Christian allegory with the ancient symbols of the barbarian religions.'..

IV
The Encyclopedic Tradition
U
p T o this point we have been studying the three great traditions-historical, physical, and moral-within which the gods survived. For the sake of clarity we have distinguished between them, and kept them as separate from one another as possible. In actual fact, from the very beginnings up to the sixteenth century, they were often intermingled. If in antiquity, as we have seen, the different philosophical schools proposed different interpretations "of the nature of the gods," these interpretations were not mutually exclusive; they were accessible simultaneously to cultivated minds, which did their best to reco}J.cile them. Logic would doubtless have demanded the adoption of one to the ex• clusion of the rest, but men felt that three keys were better than one. Sometimes one key, sometimes another, seemed more appropriate to the character of a given myth. Similarly, the scholars of the Middle Ages made no clear-cut choice.1 We frequently find them applying all three methods to a single personage or episode, or employing one method after the other in connection with different events or people. Thus Pierre d'Ailly, a remote disciple of Isidore,• considers the gods, in his Compendium cosmographiae, sometimes as heavenly bodies, and sometimes as rulers who gave their names to various parts of the world -thus unhesitatingly advancing contradictory explanations. On the other hand, intersection of the three systems may he noted at an early date. The points of contact or of overlapping between the historical, physical, and moral spheres are easy to find; at need, intermediate terms

THE E.\'Cl'CLOPEDIC TRADITIO.V 128
bridge the gaps between them. We have already seen, for example, how the physiological notion of "temperament" facilitates passage from the physical to the moral world, from the planetary gods to the Yirtues.3 But morality can also offer a helping hand to history. Boccaccio, for example, in composing his De casibus virorum et feminarum illustrium, goes to the heroes of Fable, viewed as historical personages, in search of edifying anecdotes. Finally, and most important of all, these three domains of knowledge in which we have till now attempted to keep the gods confined and partitioned were in the :!\fiddle Ages not circumscribed nor distinguished from one another. On the contrary, the whole effort of scholasticism was rather to fuse them into one, and to en• close them in a vaster sphere, which should encompass the whole of human knowledge. The encyclopedic character of medieval culture, its obsession with a scientia universalis, are strikingly shown, from the time of Isidore, in both learned and popular compilations-the Summae, tresors, or miroirs, where the "natural," the "moral," and the "historical" all haYe their place. From the twelfth century on, they are apparent in the domain of scholarship. A hierarchy of the sciences does of course exist, with Theology at their summit; but they form an organic whole, a bloc which resisted disintegration for centuries. As Soldati has justly observed,' "Even when the first fruits of humanism were beginning to ripen in art, the Middle Ages still lived on in doctrinal teaching, which only gradually felt the stirrings of ·renewal. • • • What was left of encyclopedic science had great vitality, since it antedated 'encyclopedism'-being, that is to say, classical in its sources." Numbers, as is well known, play a capital role in this reduction of the diversity of the universe to unity. In many cases, the relations established between the themes dear to medieval learning are purely numerical. Like the twelve Prophets and the twelve Apostles, the seven celestial Spheres and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, the four Elements, the four or the seven Ages, the nine Worthies and the nine Muses lend themselves to symmetrical treat• ment, to balanced combinations which seem, after the fact, to hear testimony

124! THE SURVIJ'AL OF THE PAGA."t' GODS
to profound inner relations, and to manifest a secret harmony between the truths of the faith and those of nature and history. This "sacred mathematics," a renewal of Pythagoras, would of itself account for the integration of mythology in the encyclopedic system of knowledge. We have already seen, in Chapter II, how, in the concept of the microcosm, the seven planetary divinities brought about the reconciliation of astronomy and anatomy, and how Dante established the concordance between Ages, Spheres, and Arts." This type of equivalence, moreover, has very distant origins; in the same chapter we recalled the synoptic tables drawn up by Antiochus of Athens. It would he easy to go still further hack-by way of the Apocalypse, where the seven Seals, the seven Angels, the seven Spirits of God recur constantly-to Assyria, where the seven tables of destiny are oddly related to the seven Seals, the seYen Heavens, the seven colors, and the seven days of the week." The hieratic meaning of the number seven would thus he sufficient to assure to the planetary deities an outstanding place in all the world systems elaborated throughout the centuries. A strange document, recently puhlished,7 shows the unbelievable complexity which these numerical combinations had attained at the end of the Middle Ages. This is a series of outline drawings in which a fourteenth-century scholar, a native of Pavia in Italy who lived at the court of Avignon, has attempted to translate his conception of the Universe into geometric terms. What we have here are no longer primitive designs like the rosette-shaped forms • which gave summary expression to the relationships between Man, the Elements, and the Seasons, hut learned diagrams in which notions of every sort-theological, geographical, mineralogical, medical-are combined according to the laws of number and the divisions of physical space.

planets and months, of minerals, parts of the body, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and the corresponding sins, with the seven Ages of Life dominating all the rest. In another,10 five points-the five patriarchates, seats of the princes of the Church--determine the surface of the earth. On the site of Jerusalem a crucifix is reared; from the wound in Christ's side issues a straight line, rit-us sanguinis, which crosses the picture diagonally.•.\nother line, intersecting this one, emerges from the lance of Sagittarius. At the center of the zodiac stands an immense figure of the Virgin; circles symbolize the Church Cniversal, '"spiritualis et sacramentalis," with the Pope in their midst. Along the lines thus created, on the circumferences of the circles, are arranged the Patriarchs and the lesser Prophets, the Planets, the symbols of the stars, the Elements, the parts of the body, and the names of the Months. In still another drawing,11 two crucifixes symmetrically opposed are surrounded by a rose• like form made up of Winds, medallions containing Virgin and Child, Sponsus and Sponsa, animals, Evangelists, Dogmas, and Virtues, the Sun and Moon, the Planets and Metals, the Doctors of the Church, and the monastic orders. Saturn and Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Minerva are of course no longer shown as masters of this Universe, where the whole normally gravitates and falls into place around some Christian symbol. But they are always present in the general scheme; they go to make up the Summa. It is above all the universalism of the Middle Ages which is set forth here in its full range; these compact networks of curved and straight lines express the relations between the cosmic, historical, and moral components of the universe. In a world truly '"catholic," a "total" world,

THIS CULTURAL unity finds its expression in monumental art. Certain plastic themes, assembled according to the laws of a more or less rigorous symmetry, present the medieval harmony and solidarity in concrete form. In the iconography of the French cathedrals, in the sculptures of the porches and

the motifs of stained-glass windows, Emile :'.\lale has recognized a magnificent \isual encyclopedia, where all human learning is set forth, as in a great illustrated hook, from the humblest aspects of nature to the secret of man's own destiny. Even after scholasticism as a whole began to crumble, whole sections of the great edifice remained standing £or centuries. ~ot only did Italian art in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries still associate the signs of the zodiac and the Labors of the Months, but it continued to develop symmetrical series of the Virtues and the Liberal Arts-the first dating from the ninth century, and the second going back to Martianus Capella. Under the inspiration of the Dominican monk, Filippo de' Barbieri, it even renewed, in the confrontation of Sibyls and Prophets, the old parallels between sacred and profane history.'" The gods, then, whose various modes of survival we have distinguished, are, at a very early date, ordinarily integrated with one or another of these series, or with several of them at once. Captured in "the immense net of learning," they :figured from the beginning in the miniatures illustrating the encyclopedias; 14 in the late Middle Ages and at the height of the Renaissance, they continued to have their share in vast decorative ensembles which seem like imposing ruins of the temple of universal knowledge.
*
IT IS difficult to study these ensembles methodically. They are of unequal importance, not only as works of art, but also from the point of view of the thought which they embody. Sometimes current decorative themes are used with no sign of any organic arrangement which might indicate a carefully thought-out program. Sometimes, on the other hand, everything reveals the artist's subservience to the order imposed by the mind. This reservation made, let us attempt to define the role of the gods in the pictured encyclopedias.

THE ENCYCLOPEDIC TRADITION 127
The planetary gods, the hardiest of all, are also the most skillful in insinuating themselves, but they win only tardy entrance into monumental art. They have no place in the stone Bible of the French cathedrals, where only the zodiac is admitted." The same holds true of thirteenth-century Italyheir, also, to the encyclopedic tradition, and at so many points in her iconography dependent upon France. The Planets are missing, for example, on the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, the bas-reliefs of which sing another version of ''the dual poem of science and labor," represented by the Liberal Arts and the Labors of the Months. In the fourteenth century, however, the planetary gods invade the monuments, religious and civil, of Venice, Padua, Florence, and Siena.1" In the Cappella degli Spagnuoli and in the Eremitani, for example, they are associated, if somewhat unobtrusively, with traditional elements-the Sciences in the one case, in the other the Ages of Life; 11 but they ha,;e at last become an integral part of a vaster and more imposing whole. occupying the

wall of a chapel and the choir of a church. On Giotto's Campanile, their position lends them veritable majesty; under the exalted patronage of the Prophets and Sibyls, they are seated in the same rank as the Virtues, the Sciences, and the Sacraments, and dominate the entire cycle of figures, which recounts the creation of man, his first struggles with matter, the first victories of the spirit. and the great steps in the history of civilization. But, as we have already noted, the gods appear twice on the Campanile: they are also included among the bas-reliefs of the lowest zone, where they are shown specifically as nothing less than precursors of civilization, as heroes and inventors. There are other examples of the inclusion of mythical figures in an encyclopedic scheme of decoration; in monumental Italian art, some of these occur at a quite early date. On the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, allegories of the Months and the Sciences, in combination with scenes from Genesis, make up a history of the world. But local traditions also play their part in this history.'" In one of the bas-reliefs, Romulus and Remus are a reminder of the fabulous beginnings of Rome, mother of civilization. The statuettes of the upper basin recall the origins of Augusta Perusia herself, and these origins are, in their tum, mythological: the hero Aulestes, legendary king of Etruria, progenitor of the race and founder of the city, stands near the saints Herculanus and La\\Tdnce, who later awakened it to the Christian life.lll These heroes and demigods, to some extent merged al: times with the Sages of antiquity or the nine Worthies so dear to the Middle Ages, reappear in the fifteenth century in other monumental decorations where, as on the Campanile in Florence, the planetary deities reign at their side. In the vestibule of the Chapel of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, where we have already encountered Jupiter, Minerva, Apollo, and Mars (fig. 42), several figures that had become half-legendary, such as Judas Maccabeus,
18 This has been emphasized hy R. Schneider,

19 Aulestes is a Trojan hero; we should recall
that the Trojan legend, whose alliruties with
the "historical" tradition of the gods we have already pointed out (see chap 1), is brilliantly illustrated, a century later, in the Steri of
Palermo. Aulestes is painted in the Palazzo Braccio Baglione together with other famous

This scheme, in its very strangeness, reveals a didactic intention. On examination, the figures of the ceiling are seen to constitute a summing-up of the great lessons of science and morality and the great examples offered by history; the fables and the pagan gods serve as illustration and setting for the whole edifying scheme. In the Palazzo Trinci, Foligno;' great encyclopedic themes are set forth in a series of frescoes-unfortunately now much damaged-which were painted around 1420.

Is it because of the attitudes and movements which animate them? Without doubt, Diana's undulating draperies, like Venus' nudity and her Bowing hair, take us far from the grave, hieratic :figures of the Campanile of Giotto. But this new rhythm itself betrays new sources of inspiration. No system of didactic thought, no edifying intention, is entrusted to these marble symbols.... Instead, they exalt profane sentiments of love and pride. The focus, the ideological center, is no longer to he found in a clerical conception of the L"niverse, hut in the pagan imagination of a humanist. It is the purpose of Sigismondo ~lalatesta and the genius of Leon Battista Alberti that lend a new accent, almost sacrilegious in its boldness, to this chorus of allegories. We know that Sigismondo conceived the project of raising a temple to his own glory, to that of his lady, his ancestors, and the men of learning and philosophers of his court. It was to accomplish this that the humble Franciscan church was surrounded with mausolea and triumphal arcades, and the interior chapels were :fitted with balustrades and fluted pilasters to give each the look of an ornamental screen surrounding some proud tomb. Everything seems to sing of the vainglory of man: the Prophets and Sibyls serve only as witnesses of the dual triumph of Sigismondo and his house; the planetary gods are his personal protectors, and the condottiere himself mounts to the zenith like a new planet... The sacred character of Virtues and Angels serves to heighten the significance of princely emblems, crests, crowns, and heraldic

of earthly conquerors. The cult that actually is celebrated in these precincts is not that of Christ. It resembles rather the worship which Rome once offered to her human idols-Augustus, Faustina, or Caesar. The god who is honored here is Sigismondo; the goddess is Isotta-"divae lsottae sacrum." Similarly, in the Vatican, Pintoricchio was to place the Sciences and the Planets, who had once been vassals of Theology, at the feet of a human being, Alexander Borgia... Sacrilegious flattery, perhaps, but not unnatural, in view of the other frescoes which glorified the mythological ancestors of the Pope,.. representing him as the heraldic bull among the idols-or, again, of the triumphal procession which passed through the streets of Rome on the day of his coronation, August 16, 1492. Inscriptions composed by Pomponius Lae• tus celebrated Alexander as greater than Caesar: ''The other was only a man;
this is a god." "'
*
THERE 1s, however, no final tipping of the scale in favor of paganism. On the contrary, at the very moment the Renaissance, secure in its triumph, was pre• paring to consummate its unnatural alliance with the papacy, new attempts may he observed to restore the gods to the place which they had rightfully occupied in the medieval encyclopedia-to reduce them once more to the status of mere elements in a Christian universe. Let us turn from monumental art for a moment to consider a set of engravings which, from this point of view, is of the greatest interest. We refer to the famous series known as Mantegna's Taroccki."" This series is made up of fifty figures, divided into five groups. First come the Conditions of Ma.n-the Beggar, Servingman, Artisan, Merchant, Gentleman, Knight, Doge, King, Emperor, and Pope; then Apollo and the nine Muses; then the ten Sciences-the seven Liberal Arts, Astrology, Philosophy, and Theology. The next group consists of the three Cosmic Principles-Diaco ('Bl.uric&,;), genius of Light; Cronico, genius of Time; Cosmico, genius of

of the Church. Their proper order, indicated Ly the letters .-\., B, C, D, E for the groups, and the numbers 1 to 50 for the separate figures, reproduces the order assigned by theology to the Universe. Placed edge to edge, they form, as it were, a symbolic ladder leading from Heaven to earth. From the summit of this ladder God, the Prima Causa, governs the world-not directly, but stepwise, ex gradibus, by means of a succession of intermediaries. The divine power is thus transmitted down to the lowest level of humanity, to the humble beggar. But the ladder can likewise be read from bottom to top; seen in this way it teaches that man may gradually raise himself in the spiritual order, reaching at last the heights of the Bonum, the Verum, and the Nobile-and that science and virtue bring him closer to God.°'

Thus. this card game sums up the specuiations of St. John Climacus, of Dante. and of St. Thomas Aquinas. It is true iliat we do not know its rules in detail,.., but there i,; no doubt that it was played seriously, ll-ith the feeling that each image was, as it were. a plece from the divine chessboard. And we may apply to it the words which :Sicholas of Cusa wrote of a similar game, a ..geographical globe game;' which he uses as an illustration for his philosophical thought: ..This game is played. not in a childish way, but as the Holy Wisdom played it for God at the beginning of the l\orld.'' .. In the rigorous hierarchy of the game of Tarocchi, mythological figures, as we ha,·e seen. appear at two different levels; ., they occupy inferior ranks in each case, hut differ considerably in dignity. The planetary gods appear in the first group, that of the Heavens; Apollo and the :'.\luses are in the next to the highest group-below the Arts. but aho,e ::\Ian. :'li'ow these same figures are to be found by themselves, a little later, used to express the Harmony of the Lnfrerse. Apollo, in his double role of leader of the }fuses and ruler of the Planets, is the soul of this Cosmos, from which e,·ery trace of Christianity has disappeared. The primary source of this con• cept is. indeed. a purely pagan one: we find it in :'.\lacrobius' commentary on the Somnium Scipionis (II, 3), where the }fuses have become the movers of the Spheres. The same tradition reappears in an engrning illustrating the Practica musice by Gafurio. which appeared in Milan in 1496... The image expresses a cosmic theory of the musical tonalities, and at the same time a musical theory of the world; it attempts to demonstrate "quod Musae et Sydera et Modi

atque Chordae invicem ordine conveniunt." 40 Apollo is seen enthroned at the summit of the hea,ens; from under his feet, a long, triple-headed serpent plunges straight downward to the Earth, which is surrounded by Fire, Air, and Water. The names of the musical tones and modes cross the back of the serpent, one above the other, forming as it were the cords of the lyre; at the extremities of each cord are medallions--on one side a ~luse, on the other a Planet (fig. 48). How had the correspondence of these different elements been established? There are eight strings, and eight musical modes; there are also eight celestial spheres-the spheres of the seven planets, with the addition of the hea,·en of the fixed stars, caelum stellatum." But the Muses? What shall be done with the ninth, who would make one too many? This difficulty has long since been resolved: Martianus Capella, who also assigned one celestial sphere to each of the Muses,"' decreed that Thalia should remain on earth. And in fact, at the foot of our engra,ing, we see her, associated v.ith Terra.'" In his commentary of 1518, Gafurio justifies this humiliation by referring to Cicero's statement that the earth, being motionless, was therefore silent: ''Thaliam enim primo subterraneam veluti silentium ponunt. Constat quidem apud :'.\larcum Tullium (Somn. Seip., v) terram (quod sit immobilis) silentio comparatam, quam tricipiti Cerbero Apollineis pedibus substratum comparant." 4,-;
It is for this reason that Thalia, instead of taking part in the music of the spheres, rests in the lap of the silent and immobile earth:
Terrae in gremio surda Thalia ;acet,
and that she has as companion the triple-headed serpent, the signum tri

He is thus both the origin and the center of the Lniversal Harmony. It would he interesting to follow the subsequent developments of this ··Apolloniar.'" tradition. For the moment let us merely call attention to one of its curio11S derh-ations. In the second book of the strange work in which he treats of the '"science of the proportion of letters,"' ,, Geoffroy Tory has repre sented the letter O ..selon la deue propor+..ion." Tory"s O is a divine letter, v.hich represents the sphere of the sun; it is surrounded hy all the other letters. each inscribed on one of the sun·s rays.

APoLLO and his college of Muses, Sciences, and Yirtues are now to lead us back to monumental art-to that Iow-ceiled room, small in dimensions hut vast in content, which we know as the Stanza della Segnatura. Concerning this sublime ensemble, "tout est dit, et l'on vient trop tard." We shall attempt no more than a review of the features which make it both the direct outcome of the '"encyclopedic" tradition and the august expression of a new and precarious truth. The didactic character of the work is obvious; at first glance it rtl'\·eals the profound spiritual kinship which links Renaissance art with the art of the Middle Ages.52 The use for which the room was intended would have been enough to impose this character: it was a tribunal hall, and originally also contained a library (there is at least good reason for thinking so)." As Schlosser has noted/' library decoration was traditionally "encyclopedic" in character, following the lines of a program laid down, like the classification

And the presence of similar allegories in the Eremitani in Padua is due to the fact that the buildings housed the library of the Augustinians, which was classified according to the same principles. The use of decorations of this type, furthermore, \\a5 by no means confined to monasteries. since llelozzo da Forll depicted the Liberal Arts in the library of the duke of L"rhino-where they were seen by Raphael. b is most natural, therefore. that in the Stanza della Segnatura the Sciences and Arts should be represented along v.ith Justice ., and her sister \"irtues, Fortitude, Temperance, and Prudence, But as we know, the Sciences and Ar.;, do not figure here merely in the form of allegories; they are like;o,ise illustrated in tableau.~ which give considerable prominence to the pagan world. faen though the Law is glorified by strict ceremonial Iin one case entirely ecclesiastical), and Theology Ly a council gathered about an altar, Poetry and Philosophy have as their representati..-es the sages and gods of antiquity.

. Apollo's presence in the Stanza will cause us no great surprise. As we have seen, he long ago made his entrance into the great scholastic cycle, followed by the nine :\fuses. But how are we to e\aluate his appearance here? Is he the center about which these ideal spheres gra\itate? Is he the incarnation of pagan art and reason, menacing rinls of the faith? ~o; there is no doubt that Apollo is not the principal theme nor the chief organizing force of the whole composition; he is not its soul. For it gives expression to a hierarchy of which he is not the summit. Plato, in the School o; Athens. points upward at the sky, and the whole movement of the fresco <'enters in this culminating gesture, through which the Sciences and Arts, and Philosophy herself. gh-e way before the "'knowledge of things dhine." How shall this supreme truth he revealed? :'.'iot hy the ardent discussion which resounds within the Portico, not by the exquisite dreams which hover among the laurels of the sacred mount. It gleams in silence on the altar; in the serene order of their grouping, Doctors, Saints, and Angels contemplate its disclosure, with the Trinity dominating from above. Thus the balance is not upset, nor the true order of things endangered; the human remains subject to the divine, and ancient philosophy to the Christian revelation. Thus seen, the Stanza della Segnatura marks a return to the great scholastic tradition; it restores. in all its dignity, that mighty edifice which had been weakening ever since the fourteenth century. In the same papal palace, below this very hall in which Theology has regained her true place, are the Borgia Apartments, where earthly pride challenges the majesty of heaven, and where the Seven Wise Virgins have been prostituted to the brutish descendant of Osiris. But it is no mere restoration which we see in the Stam.a. If Raphael has recovered the secret of an ideal architecture, lost since Dante and Giotto, the temple of his rebuilding shelters new thoughts as well. The disciplined ordering of all the elements in the ensemble must he studied in order to he fully understood, hut their intimate accord is instantly and strikingly apparent. In this realm, peopled by images in which two worlds come face to face, there are neither victors or vanquished; it is not the clash of two armies which we hear, hut the harmony of a choir.

All logical difficulty vanishes-or rather, it would seem, has either never existed or else been resolved with no need of the slightest effort.

The Metamorphoses of the Gods
I
!', THE PRE c ED Ix G chapters we have studied in a general way the factors which determined the survival of the gods in the Middle Ages. The pagan dhinities sen·ed as vehicle for ideas so profound and so tenacious that it would have been impossible for them to perish. That being so, why do men so often speak of the ·'death of the gods" with the decline of the ancient world, and of their "'resurrection·• in the dawn of the Italian Renaissance? We must remember that it was merely the content of the images of the gods which sunived. The garment of classical form had disappeared, having gradually been shed in fa\Or of barbaric disguises which made it impossible to identify the wearers. And, in consequence, until our own day, history has failed to recognize them. This error and this injustice are all the more easily explained since it was for so long our habit of mind to consider the antique tradition from an exclusively formal point of view. Only those works aroused our interest or held our attention in which the classical style had been preserved or recovered. The gods ceased to exist for us from the moment this style was lost. In this chapter we hope to show how extraordinary were the adventures in space and time of these gods of the Middle Ages-these hybrid and phan• tom gods-and how much may be learned of the history of civilization from a study of their metamorphoses and reincarnations.

The tradition is dual, and we must distinguish between two groups • of such figures-those which have ,isual models as prototypes, and those v.hich are based on the data of descriptive texts alone. In the first case, we have to do with copies; in the second, with reconstructions. In actual practice it is not always easy to differentiate the two, especially since there is an occasional mingling of the \ isual and literary traditions. First let us examine the very important group of illustrations which had as origin a classical image. This group is made up of three great families; the first, of purely Occidental SOlll'Ce and character, flourished until about the

The Arabs. on the other hand, consider them exclusively as symbols of a reality which they attempt to grasp with constantly increasing accuracy. Hence it arises, as a first result, that the locations, sizes. and groupings of the stars, often neglected by Westem illustrators, are scrupulously reproduced, and if need be rectified, by the Arab copyists, whose principal concern is to determine the exact forms of real constellations. But another and no less logical consequence then follows: aside from their scientific value, the Hellenistic sky figures offer no interest to the Arabs. Of what significance to them, indeed, are Hercules, Andromeda, and the host of foreign deities? Indifferent to mythology-and. for that matter, knowing nothing of it-they retain the general outlines of each figure,1° but make no effort to preserve its Greek type, costume, and attributes. Is it a Hercules that they must reproduce? They carefully locate the stars which make up the constellation, but then wrap

At first glance all these masquerading figures seem as farcical to us as do the turqueries of Moliere, hut in reality they hold more scientific infonnation than do the fine Carolingian copies of the Latin Aratea. If we look at a sky map drawn by the Arabs, we shall see that the extra,'llgant figures which people it are marked with signs referring to the catalogue of Ptolemy; they fit into a geometric system which makes it possible to locate them exactly.u It is for this reason that the Westem Middle Ages, when seized by the reviving passion for astronomy, turned away from the Ar.atea and eagerly collected and copied these Arabian manuscripts.

These inno,·ations, again, are of Islamic origin: most of them are explained. as Boll has shown, by the fact that Scot borrows from the Arabic image of the sky stars which had themselves come from the sphaera barbarica."' But when we come to the images of the planets, we find novelties ~till more astonishing; not one of the great planetary divinities has retained his customary appearance. Jupiter is repres:ented as a scholar or jurist or noble personage, seated before a lavishly spread table~ Saturn has become a warrior; Mercury is a bishop, carrying a hook as his attribute. This phenomenon is all the more remarkable since up to this time visual representation of the planets has shown almost no deviation from the classical

But taken as a whole, one would look in nin to 01~-mpus for the origin of the gods of '.\lichael Scot What series of transformations, however fundamental. could conceivably have converted '.\lercury· into an ecclesiastical dignitary?

In studying the representations of planets in Islamic manuscripts,"" Sa."<l found many singular features which on the one hand seemed to relate them to figures illustrating the llichael Scot manuscripts. and, on the other, pointed to an origin much earlier than the thirteenth century. His efforts at localizing this origin in space and time led hiin in a direct line back to ancient Babylon. It is, in fact, undeniable that while the Arab figures show almost no relationship with Greco-Roman planetary types, they do offer remarkable resemblances to types found in Babylonian sources. Thus Mercury, as a pious and scholarly figure, corresponds in character to Nebo, the writer-god; Jupiter, as judge, to :'.\larduk, who signs the decrees of destiny. The Sun himself, who in cod.

in fact, possess an uninterrupted textual tradition dealing with the planetary cults and with ritual images of the planets. These texts, the most important of which is an eleventh-century book on magic, the GM-, a,'' make it clear that in certain isolated districts of Mesopotamia the old autochthonous religion, astrolatry, still had at that date its temples and its devotees. The Haranite Saheans, for example, continued to invoke the planetary gods and to venerate their images."" Thus, in a "dead angle.'' to use Saxl's apt expression, local paganism survived in its primitive state, sheltered from outside influences ""

Tne effigie~ which adorned the sanctuaries of Haran preserved unaltered, throi:gh the centurie~, the types of the a;;tral deities. ~ow the illustrations of the .-\rah manuscripts conform perfec!ly with those effigies, as described in the Chaya: and since there exists. on the other hand, a certain relationship between the llichael Scot pictures and those of the Arab manuscripts, we are justified in connecting them., in their turn. with the Babylonian tradition. In exactly what way did the Occident fall heir to this tradition? Saxl thought that in certain cases the illustrators actually had Arab models before their eyes, hut that often they must also have been inspired by texts. One of the essential intermediaries here was the Picatrix, which, as we have already seen, was widely known in the Occident."' The Picatrix, as has been said, was in fact a translation of the Cho.ya and reproduces literally the descriptions that are found there. *
IT IS all the more important to have clarified the origin of this family of figures. since it played an extensive role in the Italian monumental art of the fourteenth century. It provides the explanation of representations contained in the great decorative cycles whose content we have studied above,"" hut which we are only now fully able to understand. In Florence, the planetary gods sculptured on the Campanile of Giotto appear, as we have noted, in disconcerting guise. The Sun, for example, is a king holding a scepter in his left hand and in his right a sort of wheel. What we have here is distinctly not Apollo, the classical deity, hut a descendant of the Asiatic solar gods.""1 Similarly. in the Cappella degli Spagnuoli, Saturn holds a spade in addition to the classical sickle;"" Mercury appears there as a scribe-indicating that we are looking at the scholarly ~ebo.

There is no doubt that we have definitely penetrated the secret of this strange iconography. ~evertheless, some difficulties remain. In spite of the attributes which reveal their origin, these gods in Florence, Yenice, and Padua are represented as if they were contemporary personages-in other words, in Trecento costume. In this respect (an oddity they share with the illustrations in :\.1ichael Scot) they differ profoundly from the Arabian figures, in which we find the Babylonian types retaining their exotic character. :\lore remarkably still, not only are they wearing Occidental dress, but in some cases they have even donned ecclesiastical ornaments. We have already called attention to the case of Nebo-l\lercury as bishop. A related example is in the choir of the EremitaniShamash-Apollo wearing the tiara. But the climax is

offered by the Marduk-Jupiter of the Campanile in Florence, muffled in a monk's robe, holding a chalice in one hand, and in the other a cross (fig. 63). These difficulties are not insoluble. First of all, let us not forget that even when these Western figures of the planets represent the same gods as do the Arab manuscripts, they are not copied from those manuscripts. However impregnated with Oriental elements the treatise of Michael Scot may be, the artists who illustrated this work allowed themselves, even while following the indications of the text, to take their models from the life around them. Even with the Arab drawings before their eyes, they did not attempt to iini

tate them. \'fe must remember. moreover. that :\fichael Scot himself had been no merely passhe recipient of those elements from the East He had elaborated them. combining them in each description with material from \'festern sources: and to this description he added. in the manner dear to medieval theology, an allegorical commentary in which he attempted to reconcile these different data and to gh·e them unity "'-a method, be it noted, completely in accord l\ith the cultural character of southern Italy. the link between Orient and Occident, between Islam and Christianity. This effort at adaptation and fusion makes Europeans and even Christians out o:f the astral divinities of Babylon. llercury, for instance, who in the Eastern representations carries a book and sometimes has a halo, is a scholar. a denish. a holy man; why should his Western equivalent not be a bishop? In this way pagan cosmogony meets, and is at the same time brought into harmony with the Christian concept of the world. We should, however, avoid generalizations. The Christianizing of Babylonian figures may have other causes, as in the case of Jupiter. On the Campanile in Florence we found Jupiter represented as a monk; the same thing occurs in the Cappella degli Spagnuoli. and in certain manuscripts."" Is this another case of assimilation, a Christian interpretation of :\larduk? :'.\iothing could be less certain; it is possible, on the other hand, that this image is directly derhed from an Oriental text According to the astrological system, each planet holds sway o,•er a certain region of the earth. The Indies, for example, as Qazwini tells us in his Cosmography, are under the dominion of Saturn; that is why Saturn is represented in certain manuscripts in the guise of an aged Indian. Jupiter is the ruler of the Westem countries, and for that reason, as the Chaya expressly states, is the patron of the Christians. In consequence, he looks like a Christian himself; and furthermore, according to the principles of sympathetic magic, those who claim his help ought to dress as he does. When praying to Jupiter, the GM.ya says explicitly, "Be humble and modest, dressed in

the manner of monks and Christians, for he is their patron; act in every way as the Christians do, and wear their costume: a yellow mantle, a girdle, and a cross.'·
Thus our Christian Jupiter is not, as might he supposed, the result of a transformation, but is the direct illustration of an astrological magic text; this example may serve to show what care should be used in the study and classification of these figures. We shall see later that innumerable errors and misunderstandings in the transmission and reproduction of the images ren• ders such a classification e,·en more hazardous and delicate. For the moment. one conclusion may he drav.-n from this summary presentation of the subject: in the domain of planetary and stellar iconography alone, several families of gods outlive the ruin of the ancient world and continue to propagate themseh·es, hut we hesitate to call them by their names-either because they are of barbarian origin, or because the original types from which they arose have become altered hy means of successive misalliances or degradations.
*
IF WE wish to pursue our study of the "pictorial" tradition beyond the illustrations in astronomical manuscripts, we shall find abundant material only in Byzantine art. In the Byzantine Empire, in fact-with its nearness to the sources and its abundance of Hellenistic models-mythology left an imprint in educated minds and even in popular sensibility, the living force of which is attested hy the arts.30 Let us recall briefly the miniatures in profane manuscripts, such as those in the Theocritus of the Bihliotheque Nationale where, in the fourteenth century, the god Pan is still represented with goat's head and cloven hoofs,11 and even the illustrations of certain religious texts, like the magnificent Paris Psalter, where demigods and nymphs mingle in scenes from the story of David, within landscapes which still seem bathed in the air of classical poetry." We should think also of the charming ivory caskets whose motifs are

inspired by Alexandrian works, even \\hen not literally copied from them; these motifs are :for the most part Cupids, Centaurs, Bellerophon, Pegasus, or the Labors of Hercules."' '"It has generally been supposed that these exquisite works began to be made in Constantinople in the period when the iconoclastic emperors wished to replace religious art by themes belonging to the Alexandrian tradition; but most of the caskets are contemporary with the brilliant literary renaissance of the eleventh and twelfth centuries."_. Lastly, se\·eral has-reliefs, some of which, for example, still adorn the fai;ades of San }Iarco in Venice and the Torcello Cathedral, treat again of these same mythological themes. 1'ow these reliefs. as is well known, were brought from Constantinople in 1204, with the famous bronze horses. In the \"rest, outside the domain of astronomy and astrology, such cases of sun-iral are rare. The manuscripts of the classical poets were not illustrated: of the two Vatican Virgile, for example, no medieval copy has been found, and we ha\·e no illustrated manuscript of Ovid. Even though they do not directly form part of our subject, ,re might perhaps note the Carolingian representations of the Passion in which Sun, Moon, Earth, and Ocean ha,·e kept their classical forms;~ but these are related to the Aratea types, and like them degenerate or disappear during the following centuries. We must direct our search elsewhere. The first encyclopedias, which seem like the debris of classical culture, usually devote one or more chapters, as l\"e have seen,• to mythology-"de diis gentium." There we may perhaps :find some figure to interest us. Of the first of the encyclopedias, the Etymologiae of Isidore, the library of Laon owns two illustrated manuscripts, of the seventh and eighth (or ninth) centuries; but in these, again, the gods appear only in the guise of

might be the halo of a saint: a postilion drives the quadriga of Apollo, and Pluto's Inferno suggests the setting for a mystery play (fig. 80). The illustrations in these two manuscripts show us, therefore, how the ~Iiddle Ages, with no help except that of the texts, attempted in different periods to restore the i,isual embodiments of the pagan gods, and that the resulting figures are completely foreign to antiquity. At the same time, neither Remi of Auxerre nor John Ridewall can be said to have created types. They founded no tradition, for the images which they inspired seem not to have enjoyed any great diffusion. The case is quite othenise with another treatise, which exerted a profound and lasting influence on the iconography of the gods; this is the Images of the Gods of the "philosopher Albricus."
*
FRo.M a very early date and until quite recently, two distinct authors were confused under the name Albricus. A Latin manuscript in the Vatican Library, Reginensis 1290, seemed to substantiate this error. The manuscript contains two texts:
r, a fairly long treatise, Albrici philosophi liber ,maginum deorum (fol. 8v.-29r.); 2) a series of very short chapters, illustrated with pen drawings, and attributed to Alhricus, with the title, De deorum imaginibus libellus (fol. lr.-8r.). The attribution of these two texts to a common author seemed at first perfectly convincing, since to a superficial view they appeared to he two different forms of the same work, the Libellus being only an abridgement of the Liber. ''The mythographer Albricus," says R. Raschke, "as Varro had already done before him, reduced his larger work to the form of an epitome." 50 In reality, as we shall prove, the relationship between the two texts is much less immediate, and more complex. But first of all we must clarify the personality of Albricus, the "first" Albricus, author of the Liber. The Liber ymaginum deorum is known under other titles; it was identified long ago with the anonymous treatise published in 1831 by Angelo Mai 50 De Albenco mytholoBO <Breslau, 1913).



THE METAMORPHOSES OF THE GODS 171
and by him attributed to a "Mythographus tertius." "1 Furthermore, in the fourteenth century it was commonly known as the Poetarius, or again as the Scin:tillarium poetarum. It is under the latter title, for example, that Raoul de Presles refers to it in his co=entary on the Cit-itas Dei (c. 13i5); in the list which he draws up of the "docteurs et auteurs desquieux a este prinse l'exposicion de ce line," he cites "Albericus Londoniensis in sintillario [sic] poetarum.'' "' One is struck by the adjective "Londoniensis." .. Was Albricus, then, an Englishman, or the pseudonym for an Englishman? In certain manuscripts in Cambridge (cod. Cantab. Trinity College 884), Oxford (cod. Digbeianus 221), and at Worcester Cathedral f cod. 154), the incipit or the explicit of the Scintillarium replaces the name Albricus with "Alexander Nequam." 54 For his part, Robert Holkott, in his Commentary on the Wisdom of Solomon, cites "Alexander Nequam in Scintillario poetarum," while another Englishman, Ridewall, author of the Fulgentius metaforalis, calls the text which is one of his principal sources Mithologia Alexandri Nequam. According to this tradition, then, Albricus would be the pseudonym of the celebrated philosopher Neckam, author of the De naturis rerum, who died in 1217. The oldest known manuscript of the Images of the Gods--cod. Vat. 3413-is of exactly contemporary origin. The "Mythographus tertius," Albricus, and Neckam would thus be one. and the same person. Some caution must still be maintained, however, with regard to this hypothesis. What, now, are the sources of the Liber ymaginum deorum, and what are its true connections with the text and pictures of the Libellus?

172 THE sc;RrlrA.L OF THE P.4.GAN GODS
Like the other treatises of the same general sort, Albricus' work condenses the mythological material collected by the grammarians and compilers of the last centuries of antiquity. He enriches this material with additions from his medie,·al forerunners. His chief sources, in fact, are the Mythologiae of Fulgentius, Senius' Commentary on the Aeneid, the Saturnalia and the Commentary on the Dream of Scipio by :'.\facrobius, the l'rfarriage of .lfercury and Philology by Martianus Capella, the Etymologiae of Isidore, and the Commentar) of Remi of Auxerre on :'.\lartianus. There are very few direct borrowings from classical literature, if we except the De natura deorum (utilized only for the interpretation of the names of the deities), and rare citations from the poets, for whom Alhricus seems to have consulted chiefly the scholiasts."" Like the other treatises, that of Alhricus still searches the myths for their ·'hidden" meaning, lending them in tum historical, physical, and, above all, moral significance. The story of Yenus and :!.\fars, for example, becomes Lust dishonoring Yirtue. When the Sun unveils their guilty love, Venus revenges herself by leading astray the five daughters of the Sun-that is to say, the :five senses: Pasiphae, the sense of sight; Medea, hearing; Circe, touch; Phaedra, smell; Dirce, taste. Such as it was, with its heavy allegorical apparatus, the work appears to have enjoyed a great vogue and great authority among the educated. We have an example in Raoul de Presles, who knew it by heart, .. and, in fact, as a mythological manual or dictionary, it constituted a precious auxiliary in reading the poets. Hence its appellations of Poetarius and Scinlillarium poetarum. But it was also to become an aid to artists, furnishing them with themes of inspiration; we shall see this when we examine the links which connect the work with the Libellus de imaginibus deorum.
In spite of appearances, the Libellus is not a simple abridgement of the Liber. It does indeed derive from it, but indirectly, and after an interval of two centuries. Between the two works stands, :first of all, an intermediary of prime importance, since it is no other than Petrarch himself•

THE ,\!ETAMORPHOSES OF THE GODS 173
Pierre de Nolhac noted years ago •• that Petrarch's library contained a collection which, among other manusciipts, included the Liber mythologi,arum of Fulgentius, and the Poetarius Albrici i·iri illustris, unde idolorum ri.tu.s inolei·erit, ubi omnis 1:etustas deorum antiquorum exprimitur. Petrarch, it thus appears, made use of our Albricus, and drew from it a good part of his mythological knowledge. Better still, he made direct use of it in writing the third canto 0£ his Latin epic, Africa, composed to honor the memory of Scipio. In the poem Lelius., on a mission as ambassador to Syphax, King 0£ Numidia, is received in a splendid hall, the decorations of which he admires at length. Among these decorations appear the gods of Olympus:
Undique fulgentes auro speciesque Deorum Et formae heroum stabant atque acta priorum...
Petrarch describes them individually, in 123 verses (140-262), following step by step the indications of Alhricus. However,-and th1& should be even more interesting for us--since his aim is simply to describe and not to moralize, of the mythological material from which he thus borrows, he retains only the pictorial elements, the visual details indicative of the pose, costume, and attributes of each god:
Iupiter ante alios, augusta in sede superbus Sceptra manu fulmenque tenens; ]ovis armiger ante Unguibus ldaum juvenem super astra leiabat. Inde autem incessu gravior tristisque senecta V ewto capite et glauco distinctus amictu,

1741 THE Sl:RnrAL OF THE PAGA.\' GODS
Thus Petrarch preserves only those details which have the value of images; as a humanist and man of taste, he disregards what was meant to impro,;e or instruct. But stripped thus to essentials, the "images of the gods" which he traces one after the other with his elegant and precise hand, form a little repertoire at once clear, detailed, and likely to be of immediate use to the artist who might turn to it for inspiration. In short, we find in this third Canto of the Africa the prototype of a Libellus de imaginibus deorum; better still, as we shall soon see, we find in it the true model of our Libellus. But the road which leads from Petrarch to the "second" Alhricus is not a direct one. Once again the figures of the gods, to which the classicizing poet had attempted to restore their purity of contour, are to serve as themes of medieval allegory. Between the Africa and the Libellus comes the Ovide moralise composed in Avignon, around 1340, by Petrarch's friend, Pierre Bersuire.00 following the counsels of the poet and the lines of his Africa. This Oiiide moralise, is in fact a sort of appendix to the Reductorium morale,61 the great work in which Bersuire laboriously, in thirteen books, gave moral meaning to the Liber de proprietatibus of Bartholomaeus Anglicus. In order to complete this vast work of moralization, he added to it three more books: the fourteenth treats of the marvels of nature, the sixteenth of difficult passages in the Bible. As for the fifteenth, it brings us the Metamorphoses, interpreted according to the same principles and with the same intent. As introduction to this fifteenth hook come seventeen chapters dealing with the form of each god. In this section, as in all the others, the author is seeking troths, more or less profound. beneath surface appearances; hut at the beginning of each chapter he gives us a short introduction which, this time, treats only of the god's image as such. He pens a brief description which is to serve

as profane nucleus for the moralization. From whom has he borrowed these portraits of the gods? He tells us in the clearest of terms: '"Sed antequam ad fabulas descendam, primo de formis et :6.guris deorum aliqua dicam. Verumtamen, quia deorum ipsorum imagines scriptas vel pictas alicubi non potui reperire, habui consulere venerabilem virum magistrum Franciscum de Petato [sic], poetam utique profundum in scientia et facundu.m in eloquentia et expertum in omni poetica et historica disciplina: qui prefatas imagines in quodam opere suo eleganti metro describit, discurrere etiam libros Fulgentii, Alexandri "" et Rabani, ut de dh-ersis partibus traham figuram vel imaginem, quam d1is istis ficticiis voluerunt antiqui secundum rationes phisicas assignare." "" However distorted the name may he (the edition of Colart Mansion was to translate it as "Fran~ois du Pre"),.. it is not difficult to recognize '"Petato" as Petrarch; as for the "opus quodam," this is evidently Africa. To assist his friend in his search for information "de formis et figuris deorum,'' Petrarch, with. his customary generosity, has communicated to him the verses in which he has described the palace of Syphax 00-and this, incidentally, might have made it unnecessary for Bersuire to turn to the poet's own sources: Fulgentius, Rabanus Maurus, and Alhricus. It is these brief introductions of Bersuire on each of the gods, brought together and once more freed of their commentaries, that finally made up, toward 1400, the Libellus de imaginibus deorum which, as a whole, follows very closely the text of the Ovide moralise.""

has remained anonymous, but we now have no trouble in understanding how he could have been confused with Albricus. We need do no more than com• pare the image of Saturn, for instance, as found in Alexander Neckam( ?), Petrarch, Bersuire, and the Libellus, to satisfy ourselves that the tradition has varied but slightly from one author to another (see accompanying table).

However, the difference between the "first" and the "second" Albricus is profound, for the spirit has changed. Whereas the Liber ymaginum brought together the mythological substance encumbered with the medieval glosses, the libellus, renewing Petrarch, and again separating the images from the allegorical ensemble in which Bersuire had reinserted them, offers us a clear text, determinedly profane and purely iconographical. The same formula recurs in it constantly: "Pingebatur." This formula tends to freeze the god in some one typical and immutable attitude and setting, which can be

easily studied and endlessly reproduced. It seems. in fact, to demand illustration, and illustrations of it were not lacking. Cod. Reginensis 1290, which contains the text of the Liber as well as that of the Libellus, is decorated, as we have seen, with curious pen drawings, executed around 1420. These drawings lack neither life nor charm, hut the
divinities which they present offer almost no kinship with the antique types. In the absence of any sort of visual model-the lack of which we have already noted in the case of Remi's and Ridewall's illustrations-the most scrupulous artist will inevitably fall into blunders and anachronisms. But in the Libellus we have a vivid example of another weakness inherent in reconstructions of this sort, due to the fact that they are based on heterogeneous texts and are therefore made up of unrelated fragments. Let us, for example, analyze the image of Apollo as the Libellus has described it and as it has been faithfully represented by the artist (fig. 68). The table on the following page makes clear its composite origin.



178 THE Sl:RVH'AL OF THE PAGAN GODS
Thus, strictly speaking, the illustrations of the Libellus are grounded not on any one text, hut on a mosaic of texts. It is this which gives them their doubly artificial character: they are composite portraits, formed of scattered

But, all the same, these artificial and "synthetic" gods live and multiply.

it served as a repertory or manual of iconography. Aside from Reginensis 1290, there are many manuscripts in which we :find the gods pictured according to the tradition of Albricus. The earliest till now known, Paris 6986 and Vat. Reg. 1480:• hardly go back farther than 1370, but the common model which served for both may ha,·e been executed in the first half of the four• teenth century." In any case, we possess a very rich series of miniatures ,._ French, Flemish, and Italian-which hear witness alike to the diffusion and the stability of the Albricus types, all of whose features have been once and for all standardized by the Libellus.
*
IF WE have dwelt at some length upon Albricus and upon the tradition that he founded, it is because of his exceptional importance. He is, in reality, not merely a precursor, but one of the principal agents of the Renaissance, since it is in part by way of his text and the visual images engendered by his Images of th.e Gods that the Olympians regain their sovereignty. Indeed, as we shall soon show, the text of Albricus is to continue, directly or by way of Boccaccio," to serve as a base to mythographers and a source to humanists, while its illustrations remain the standard types for artists throughout the Quattrocento and even beyond.
*
THE FOREGOING exposition has brought us down to the first years of the fif. teenth century-in other words, to the threshold of the "Renaissance." By this date, the two great iconographical traditions which we have traced from late antiquity have led, each in its own way, to a profound alteration of the classical types of the gods. We have observed the reasons for these alterations as we went along. If we omit the cases of substitution (such as the replacing of Olympian figures by the Babylonian planetary types), they may be reduced in essence to two:

either the artist has a dsual model but, being ignorant of the subject-that is to say, lacking an explanatory text-is unable to render it correctly, or he has nothing hut a text, and in this case his reconstruction, even when carefully made, is bound to entail a certain risk, because there is no model which would

permit him to check its accuracy. A typical example of the first case is the curious transformation of the Medusa head in the illustrations of astronomical manuscripts: the Arab copyist, knowing nothing of Greek mythology, mistook the blood dripping from the severed head for a beard, and changed the Gorgon into a hirsute demon!' His error is even perpetuated in the terminology of modem astronomers, who still give the name Algol, meaning "demon," to the strange star in the constellation Perseus whose brightness varies periodically. On the other hand, we have seen (figs. 67 and 12) what amusing caricatures result from the attempts of the medieval illustrators to reconstruct, on the basis of Pausanias, a statue of Apollo 71 or of the Olympian Zeus." It might be instructive and diverting to list the manifold forms taken on by one specific deity. As we do so, we shall he unable to decide whether it is

Occasionally errors arise which are only to he explained by corruptions in the text itself, or by misreadings!" Thus Pluto, in the Rabanus Maurus manuscript (although the illus· trations are derived from an antique model), carries in his hand a jar; this unaccustomed attribute arises simply from a confusion between orca, meaning jar, and Orcus, the realm of the dead (fig. 65). Comparable misunderstandings have been produced through translation-as is true, for example, in lapidaries.80 Thus, the mysterious figure who holds sometimes a hook, sometimes a hare, in the French lapidaries, is in reality the zodiacal sign of the Scales: libra has become liebra in Spanish, livre or lievre in French.11 The Latin manuscripts of Picatrix contain variants capable of producing wholly different images: thus the figure of Saturn, "according to the learned Mercury," is that of a man having under his feet, as is said in some texts, "similem unius lagori id est racam"; in others, "aliquid simile racemo." In the first case, a lizard must he placed beneath Saturn's feet; in the second, a hunch of grapes. Still more surprising is what happens to Andromeda. In the Apothecarius of the library at Chartres we read: '"Si inveneris Andromadam quae haheat crines sparsos atque manus remissas, ille lapis . • • habet potestatem reconciliandi inter se virum et uxorem." Now this is the version found in ms. F. fr. 9136 of the Bibliotheque Nationale: "Si tu trouves un dromadaire qui ait les cheveux epars sur les epaules, icelle pierre rend paix et concorde entre marl et femme." Andromeda has been changed into a dromedary, through the intermediary of dromedarius.82 In the Arab texts, homonyms have similarly been responsible for unexpected representations. Thus in the manuscript of Qazwini (cod. Vindob.

Fl. 1438, N. F. 155), Jupiter holds a phallus in his raised hand instead of a scepter; the word used in the text might signify either object.83 Other representations find similar explanation, such as that of Cassiopeia with a bleeding hand, etc. And all these misunderstandings, confusions, false interpretations, which sometimes end by completely corrupting the images, are at bottom at• trihutable to something still more general-the fact that the gods have traveled widely. Let us recall their itineraries: sometimes they go from East to West, from Egypt, Syria, even Mesopotamia, to Sicily and Spain; sometimes from North to South, from England into France and Italy. Now each of these removes, with the translations and adaptations which it im·olves, adds to the chances of error. On the other hand, all these roads end undoubtedly, sooner or later, by bringing the classical gods back to the lands of their birth-but after how many centuries, how many wanderings and detours, and in what a state! Europe, in short, recovers her gods very much as she received Aristotle--"mutilated, botched, crippled, turned from Greek into Arabic and from Arabic into Latin.""' Their long absence and their vagabond pathsleading sometimes so far from their native shores-have made them into foreigners. But now that they have at last returned to their homeland, we shall see them gradually undergoing formal reintegration-regaining, at least in large part, their natural bearing and their familiar look.

II
The Reintegration of the Gods
W
E H Av E seen how, in the Middle Ages, the gods lost their classical form, either because it underwent gradual change, or because it was dropped in favor of the most unexpected disguises. How and why did it come about that, in the second half of the fifteenth century, the original form was reintegrated? This is the problem which remains for us to solve. We shall consider it according to the plan adopted in the preceding chapter-that is to say, by limiting ourselves to certain iconographical series, and by distinguishing between the ,·isual and the literary traditions, from which our examples will successively be drawn.
*
WE HAVE followed. in the illustrations of the astronomical manuscripts, the alteration of the Hellenistic types of the constellations. A few of these types, however-those of the Aratus manuscripts-were retained in relative and sometimes even surprising purity beyond the Carolingian period; but in the end they, too, underwent deterioration before being replaced, toward the dawn of the thirteenth century, by the Orientalized types.1 Now, in the fifteenth century, we come upon a family of manuscripts, embracing the ,\hole century in date, but all issuing from a codex of the Ara.tea, discovered in Sicily, which Poggio is known to have had in his hands." Of these copies, one was executed for the Duke of Urbino (Urbinat. 1385), another for the Medici (Laurent. 98 sup. 43), and another for Ferdinand of

THE REINTEGRATIO:V OF THE GODS 185
Aragon, king of Naples (Barberin. 76). They mark the retum to an authentic tradition, and this is of itself extremely interesting; but much may also be learned from a comparison of them. The earliest of the copies, exe• cuted by artists still half immersed in the medie\·al tradition, have not successfully reproduced the style of the model: attitudes and draperies rather betray the influence of their own time. On the other hand, the last copyist, represented by the Naples manuscript, has freed himself fiom this influence. Even though he is less skillful than the others, he has a better understanding of the qualities of the prototype, restoring to it its dignity, its equilibriumeven the frame which surrounds it and the delicacy of its color modeling (fig. 71). Thus, from now on. the evolution tends to come full circle: instead of moving farther away from the antique model, it approaches it more and more closely. The same phenomenon is seen even more clearly in the Orientalized series of astral :figures. There, as the reader will recall, the Hellenistic demigods had undergone disguise at the hands of the Arabs into characters from the Thousand and One Nights. But they likewise now slowly revert to their original aspect. Let us take the example of Hercules. We have spoken of his strange reincarnations: a short jacket, crossed in front, and a pair of breeches had been given him to mask his muscular nudity; on his head he wore a turban. In the same process, he had lost his lion's skin and had exchanged his club for a scimitar.• Let us now see how he appears in a Vienna manuscript which contains a sky map (Vindobon. 5415). This manuscript dates from before 1464 and comes from southern Germany; its illustrator, though German, has followed the designs of a North Italian artist. The Oriental descent of this Hercules is recognized at first glance by means of the scimitar which he brandishes, but he has already lost much of his exotic look-for one thing, he no longer wears a turban. But he still has a certain distance to travel before his true form is fully regained, and it is Diirer himself who will aid him in the process. Diirer, in fact, was inspired by our Vienna manuscript, or by one of the same family, when he composed
8 E.g., cod. Paris. arah. 5036 (fig. 59).



186 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGA..'V GODS
his famous sky map of 1515, the first chart of the heavens to be printed. But he introduces modifications, or rather, decisive rectifications, into the style of the figures; he frees Hercules from his outworn Eastern trappings, the

5 It is remarkable, as F. Saxl observes, that in this manuscript we find, along with astronomical tables helonging to the Arab tradition, and
Nessus shirt which has encumhered him for centuries: the club is placed in his right hand again, and the lion's skin on his left shoulder. The hero, in short, once more emerges as his true self (fig. 72). Perseus may be taken as a similar example, and perhaps an even more instructive one. We have described his Arabic outfit and the bearded head of the demon Gu.I which he carries instead of the bleeding Medusa head. He continues to be represented in this form in Western manuscripts which copy the Arab as• tronomical figures without recognizing in them the old pagan divinities.' Now in the same Vienna manuscript of which we have just spoken, which continues the Arab tradition even while mitigating its exotic character," Perseus is represented nude; however, his victim's head is still that of the demon-"caput Algol." 6 Here a.gain it is Diirer who accomplishes Lhe restoration of the original ima-ge. In his version, not only has Perseus regained his winged feet, but it is now

the head of Medusa which he grasps by its serpent locks. In order to dispel all doubt. Diirer has added the words "caput Meduse." In the Michael Scot manuscripts, which form a separate group, the figures again evolve in the same direction. Thus-and as early as the first half of the fifteenth century-the illustrator of cod. Vindohon. 3394 (fol. 222 v.), an Italian, substitutes the classical Perseus for the frightful Oriental gnome who still represents him around 1400 (for example, in cod. Vindohon. 2378, fol. 7 ,,.. ). But Diirer's restorations deserve a moment's attention; let us try to define the spirit which has inspired them. What Diirer has given hack to the celestial demigods is not merely their traditional attributes: it is the life and breath of paganism. For his immediate predecessors, and even for the Italian draftsman whose work he is transposing, Hercules and Perseus are hardly more than what they had been for the Arabs-mere outlines, graphic symbols. Diirer now endows these diagrams with flesh, vigor, and relief; muscles stand out, heads take on expressive power. Thus transfigured, his heroes share in the same animal force which he restores to Dog, Bear, and Bull. In his sky, swarming with its unleashed monsters, resounding to the heavy galloping of Sagittarius, the gods in their tum are roused from their torpor; mixed though it may he, the blood which flows in their veins is warm and pulsating, and restores them to their fabled existence. However, this reawakening of a sense of plastic values and mythological correctness is not accomplished at the expense of scientific accuracy; on the contrary, the map of 1515 represents both effort and progress in that direction. The stars which form the substance of Diirer's drawings have had their positions scrupulously assigned by Conrad Heinfogel, with due attention to the work of the Arab astronomers; none of the celestial globes hitherto made had offered as solid or precise a base for study of the heavens. This alliance of strength and energy, of calculation and life, is without doubt characteristic of Diirer's personal genius, but it is also a sign of the times. To recover the forms used by the ancients as well as their learning, their poetic imagination, and their knowledge of the universe--to reconcile,

as they did, mythology and geometry--such was to be the dream of the greatest spirits of the Renaissance. The great gods, like the heroes, were eager to resume their rightful visage. Curiously enough, it is in Germany again that we witness other interesting attempts to aid them in doing so. In the course of the fifteenth century, certain Northern artists appear to have become suddenly aware of the incongruity of representing Jupiter or Mercury under the extravagant aspect which he had taken on. either through Michael Scot or in the illustrated encyclopedias; these artists turned to the pre-Gothic period for models closer to antiquity. Thus, in the Palatinate, the illuminator of Palatinus lat. 291 copies, around 1430, the illustrations of the celebrated treatise of Rabanus Maurus, De rerum naturis;' now among these figures, as we have seen, were images of the Olympic gods-images crude and in many respects faulty, but as a whole of indisputably classical descent. For more than four centuries they had fallen into complete oblivion, and were looked at by no one. A local miniaturist now discovers and sets out to copy them. Admittedly, his copy has a contemporary flavor of its own, but it establishes a new link with the great pictorial tradition, and at the same time prepares the way for the reappearance of the gods in their classical form (fig. 66). We have seen how, in the manuscripts of Michael Scot, the figures of the planetary gods had, toward the end of the Middle Ages, assumed the most unexpected forms. We have explained the relevant influences, finding descendants of the Babylonian gods clothed in Giottesque costumes. But now, in the first half of the fifteenth century, we note in certain copies of these manuscripts the disappearance of the barbaric types, and their replacement by figures much closer to the Greco-Roman originals. How is this to be explained? Like the painter of the Rabanus Maurus illustrations, one of the illuminators of Michael Scot• has turned back to a relatively pure source: he has taken as model a Carolingian copy of the "Calendar of 354," and in so doing he also, despite his lack of skill, has placed himself in contact with the classical prototypes.

*
LET us now see what has become of the literary tradition. As will be remembered, this term designates the ensemble of figures illustrating the allegorized mythological treatises---the common character of these figures (which begin in the fourteenth century to supplant other types) being that they are based exclusively on texts. They are reconstructions.



190 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
We have sketched the history of this tradition, in which the "Mythographus tertius," Albricus, occupied a leading place. A whole family of gods emerged from his Liber ymaginum deorum and its successive recastings. Conceived without the benefit of any real model, and without the slightest contact with classical art, these artificial gods might appear to have had but small chance of survival; nevertheless, not only did they beget offspring of
77. Mars
their own, but against all expectation they gradually prepared the return of the rightful gods. The slightest familiarity with these types-not a hard thing to acquire, since they are distinct from all others-will show them to us on every hand. It would seem that, outside the astrological tradition, which in general adhered to its own types and laws, they constituted the chief repertory which artists continued to draw upon from the fourteenth to the end of the fifteenth century, and even later. We meet with them in France, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy-in miniatures, tapestries, and enamels, in painting and sculpture. It would be easy to trace, for example, the type of Mars in fury, mounted in a chariot drawn by two horses, helmeted, whip in hand, and accompanied by a wolf. It is thus that Petrarch describes him, following Albricus, who has constructed his own picture out of fragments of Servius and Statius: ••• Mavortis imago Curribus insistens aderat furibunda cruentis: Hine lupus, hinc rauce stridentes tristia Dire; Cassis erat capiti fulgens manibusque flagellum.•

mistakably related, curious variations a1e to he noted between them. At times, these even affect the iconographical details. Thus, the war-god holds in his hand in some cases a whip, in others a sword, halberd, or ftail. Several of these variations can be explained as mere errors. Thus, when the illuminator of ms. ThotL 399 and the engraver of the Ovitle moralise of the Colart Mansion edition replace the whip by a Hail, it is because the French text had translated Alhricus' Latin flagellum as fl,ayeu (fl,eau) .'" Even more curious than this substitution of attributes is the appearance of quite different persons as escort for the god. Thus, the Mars of the Tempio Malatestiano is preceded by an

advancing female figure, who holds the reins of the horses in one hand, and in the other an object that appears to be a trumpet. On the bas-reliefs at Landshut this figure does not appear; instead, two men are seen engaged in mortal combat beneath the chariot. It is apparent that here the sculptor has followed the version of the Libellus:"" ••Et quia Romani fratres geminos urbis primos fondatores. scilicet Romulum et Remum, Martis filios esse finxerunt, quorum Romulus Remum interfecit, ideo sub ejus curru idem Romulus depictus erat, qui et fratrem Remum occidebat.•• At Rimini, on the other hand, Agostino di Duccio seems to have been following the text of Petrarch which we have quoted above:
. . . . hinc raU,Cae stridentes tristia Dira.e.
The divergencies between the two representations would thus correspond in this case 01 to different branches of the Alhricus tradition. But the variants in \\hich we are now most interested are those hearing upon the style of the figures: in one case, for example, Mars is seen driving through a rural landscape in a heavy peasant's v.agon, much after the fashion of Lancelot, the knight, in his ca1t; ""elsewhere he resembles a Roman legion• ary mounted on a veritable battle chariot." At the same time, in passing from the type alla francese to the type all'antica. the formal character of the image undergoes marked changes. It is the stages in this formal evolution of our series of images which we now wish to sketch in their main outlines. This story, it may be said, parallels that of the geographical diffusion of the types; broadly seen, it appears like a struggle or an exchange of influences between Northern and Western Europe, the region from which the images come, and Italy, which they are doing their best to conquer.

THE REINTEGRATIOS OF THE GODS 195
The treatise of Albricus, it should he remembered, is the work of an Englishman; of the miniatures which derive from it, the earliest are found in French manuscripts of the Ovide moralise (Paris 6986 and Yat. Reg. lat. 1480), both dating from the end of the fourteenth century. The Gothic accent in these miniatures is strongly marked. Apollo wears an elegant doublet and long, pointed shoes; Mars, a helmet and gauntlets; Juno, an ermine cotte. But their anachronism is not the only distinguishing feature of these naive images; they also tend to become distinctly more sober and restrained. They adhere faithfully to the text in all essential points, but they do not translate its every detail. Generally speaking, they reduce the overrich content of the Albricus descriptions. Thus, the illustrator of the Vatican manuscript shows neither the Muses in his picture of Apollo nor the merchants and thieves with his Mercury. The significance of these simplifications will easily be gathered: they eliminate all that would overload the composition and disturb the lay• out on the page or the framing. The images, thus disencumbered, are clearly organized; sometimes they are even quite symmetrical. This effort at styliza• tion-not, by the way, equally advanced in all the manuscripts-is particu• larly striking if we recall the illustrations in the manuscript of Remi of Auxerre " the tradition of which was followed by Albricus. There, the artist spared us no detail, no accessory~ in his concern to reproduce the whole con• tent of the text, he scattered its details diffusely over the page. These qualities of the French miniatures. which they were to retain throughout the fifteenth century (figs. 75 and 80), later passed into Flemish engraving; we find them in the woodcuts of the Ovide moralise printed in Bruges in 1484 by Colart Mansion 25 (fig. 77). Are we to see here the traditional qualities of French art, and in particular that mastery of composition which gives such legibility to the little scenes inscribed on the bas-reliefs of the cathedrals? Or shall we rathe1, with Sax!, look for a reflection of Giottesque style? At about this same time,

Taddeo di Bartolo, in the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena, represented four divini
ties 2• who are not connected-at least not directly-with the Alhricus tradition," but who have also been reduced to the simplest lines, even though preserving a marked medieval flavor in attitude and costume.

Around 1420, we find the images of the gods entering upon a new phase. The pen drawings illustrating the Libellus text in ms. Vaticanus Reginensis 1290 contrast in several points with the sober Gothic effigies: they are gay, imaginative, free, and exuberant (fig. 68). Far from suppressing any figures, this artist has invented them as he pleased. Thus, in the group around Venus, he adds a woman as target of one of Cupid's arrows; 28 at Mercury's

side he places a kneeling figure who, like the god himseli, is playing a flute. Another striking novelty is the introduction of several nude figures. For the most part, to be sure, the figures are clothed-and in the fashion of the time: Orpheus might he a troubadour and the Corybantes mace-bearers. But Venus is once more Anadyomene, and the three Graces sport with her among the waves. We shall find this same freedom in composition, this mingling of naked bodies with contemporary costume, in other representations from the first half of the fifteenth century, such as the miniatures of an English manuscript at Oxford (Rawlinson B. 214; fig. 70), or a series of drawings in the Dresden Print Cabinet."" Even outside the Albricus circle, indeed, a parallel evolution of mythological types is to he noted. This becomes clear if we compare two series of pictures of the planets of which we have already spoken 30-the frescoes by Guariento in the choir of the Eremitani in Padua, and the miniatures of a Modena manuscript, the Liber physiognomiae (figs. 85 and 87). The two series are connected, as has long been recognized; 01 but the fourteenth-century Venus, with her solemn bearing and her drapery, recalls the allegorical type of the French cathedrals--Luxuria, for instance, who also holds a mirror; 82 in contrast, in the Liber physiognomiae, which dates from around 1430, Venus is a young woman, naked and smiling, her hair unbound, who has shed her quasi-ecclesiastical dignity along with her garments. It would seem, therefore, that a new spirit has begun to animate my• thology; hut the transformation is not yet final. On the contrary, this whole group of representations is characterized by its ambiguity. If certain deities -Minerva, for instance--are obviously striving to recover their classical form, the majority still wear their bourgeois disguises. And the nude forms themselves have not the slightest sculptural quality; they suggest rather the fragile Eves of the French manuscripts. In reality, these images offer us a sort of compromise between Franco-Flemish naturalism and the idealistic

greater penetration of the Westem style. '\re must not be surprised at :finding these same contrasts and contradictions in the famous illustrated Chronicle 80 attributed to Finiguerra: demigods accoutered as pages or knights, but posed like statues (Paris, Troilus, Jason, Romulus) ; ladies wearing the hennin headdress (Helen); nude forms already skillfully drawn (the men and women recreated by Deucalion and Pyrrha) ; a couple alla francese under a frieze all'antica (Rape of Helen). At the same time, these disparate elements do not clash; instead, we find everywhere the same balance between realism of character and idealism of attitude which is to give Florentine Quattrocento art its unique savor. In these gropings, this timid showing of the nude among figures heavily draped, this alternating rhythm of serene immobility and gay vivacity, we should perhaps not only see an effort to reconcile two different spirits, two distinct artistic climates, but also distinguish between the two concepts of classical antiquity which alternately attracted the precursors of the Renaissance. The ambiguity that we note in this period in the form and attitude of the gods is doubtless due in part to their allegiance to both North and South, 33 See supra, p. 28.



THE REI".;TEGR.4.TIO'w OF THE GODS 199
but also to the fact that the spirit which animates them is sometimes Dionysian in essence and sometimes Apollonian.
*
LET us now see what has become of the gods of Albricus in the second half of the fifteenth century. We re-encounter them, around 1465, in the famous Tarocchi of )lantegna, the subject matter of which we have already thoroughly examined," where several of them appear in the character of planetary powers. The pedigree of these figures is not open to doubt. Thus, the image of Venus (A 43; fig. 86) corresponds point for point with the description in the Libellus. She is bathing ("nuda et in mare natans") and holds a shell in her right hand ("in manu sua dextera concham marinam conti
nens"); beside her are 82. Mercury and Argus the Graces ('"et coram ipsa tres astabant juvencule nude, que tres Gracie dicebantur") and Amor with bow and bandaged eyes ('"Huie et Cupido ••• cecus assistebat ••• sagitta et arcu •.."); above her is a flight of doves ("et columbis circa se volantibus comitabatur"). On the other hand, the influence of the Western miniatures still makes itself felt; thus Jupiter (A 46; fig. 50) is shown seated not on a throne, as the text would have it, but
H See supra, pp. 137 fE.

in a rainbow just as he is in a French fourteenth-century manuscript (Paris. 6986); 35 even more significantly, his position exactly recalls that of the Christ in Majesty on Romanesque tympana and capitals (or, to take a later example, in the Apocalypse tapestry at Angers), for the Christ, also,
83. Mercury
is surrounded by an almond-shaped frame which cuts across the rainbow. However, certain types have been modified. Apollo •• still has his crown, but instead of treading on the three-headed monster beneath his feet, he is seated on two swans, and his feet rest on a celestial globe. Mercury has kept some of his attributes-the flute, the cock, and the Argus head-but he is dressed in a loose tunic, wears a sort of cap with pointed visor, and is shod in soft boots (fig. 83). What is the source of these alterations in the traditional types? The origin of the new Apollo is still shrouded in mystery. But Saxl succeeded in discovering that of the new Mercury"' -a discovery, as will be seen, of the highest interest: the model which inspired the artist of the Tarocchi (indirectly, it is true) was a Hellenistic relief. This bas-relief had been found some years earlier, and copied by Cyriacus of Ancona during a voyage to Greece and the Archipelago. A copy of his drawing is in the Bodleian today (ms. Canonicianus lat. misc. 280); we recognize in it a Hermes of archaic or rather of archaistic type, with pointed beard (a-,t,7Jvo1rw-y.,,), as he is ordinarily represented on black-figured vases. The same image appears, moreover, in line-for-line identity, in a relief
aJ The same rainbow is i;een in the Dresden drawing (see Lavallee, op. c,t, fig. 26). •• The Apollo shown here is the leader of the choir, in the series of the Muses (D 20) ; in
the planetary series (A 44) only the chariot of the Sun is represented, with Phaeton's fall. 31 Rinasc,mento delfantich,ta, pp. 252 ff.., fig. 21.



THE REINTEGRATION OF THE GODS 201
from Panticapaeum 88 which is an exact replica of the one seen by Cyriacus. Delighted by his discovery, in which he saw a happy omen for a trav• eler,88 Cyriacus let his friends know of it. Carlo Avellino, for instance, writes in this connection to Poggio:
Kyri.acus nobis misit modo mu.nera, Poggi, Mercurium, propria pinxerat ille manu.; Ut vidi obstupui . . .""
It is thus clear that the drawing passed from hand to hand; the type soon began to penetrate Italian art: one :finds it on the cassoni,41 in the Riccardiana Virgil,.. in a medal made by Noccolo Fiorentino for Lorenzo Tornahuoni,"' in a wood engraving illustrating the Metamorphoses,.. etc. It is natural, therefore, that it should have been introduced into the series of the Tarocchi;" hut, curiously enough, it was not substituted for the medie"al type--it was combined with it. The general look and pose, and the costume, are derived from the relief, hut the accessories are still those enumerated in the Libellus. These diverse elements, however, do not clash, perhaps because the archaizing silhouette of the Hermes, ancient hut not classical in the strict sense of the word, easily falls into line, in its picturesque oddity, with the other Alhricus images. However that may he, we have here a singular instance of assimilation: an antique figure is grafted onto the medieval stem, and draws from it the nourishment of Western naturalism.

202 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the mythological types of the Tarocchi mark a certain progress toward classicism. Compared with figures of the first half of the century, they strike one at first by their sobriety and balance of composition. They eliminate a large number of details and secondary personages in the interest of a more concentrated arrangement. From this point of view, they recall the severe, stylized types of the French fourteenth century.•• But an entirely new elegance and dignity have now appeared, serving as a corrective for the Gothic dryness. The previously slender forms are more ample, and the proportions have gained in breadth; there is generosity in the gestures and rhythm in the movements, and a quiet harmony seems gradually to do away with any sharp or shrunken look left over from the miniatures. A slight grimace or a frown may still distort the faces of the gods, hut we feel that they are on the point of recovering their superhuman serenity along with their marble physique. Before leaving the gods of the Tarocchi, we should note that they serve, around 1471, to illustrate the manuscript of a poem by Ludovico Lazzarelli, De gentilium deorum imaginibus." Around 1500, Apollo and his train of Muses decorate a cupola in a palace on the Via Belvedere, Ciemona.48 At this period they have already emigrated northward; by 1490 we find them in Nuremberg... Pursuing his strange destiny, the famous Hermes of Cyriacus of Ancona becomes a naturalized German, thanks first to Diirer .. and later to Hans Burgkmair.11 He even travels to the Hanseatic provinces: a Liibeck calendar•• so popularizes him that he becomes a common motif of decoration for the fat;ades of German and Austrian houses...,

THE REINTEGRATION OF THE GODS 208
In Nuremberg we also find traces of the Apollo with the two swans. He, too, was copied by Diirer," and Peter Vischer gives him a place of honor among the bronze figures on the base of the shrine of St Sebald.55 The diffusion of these mythological types throws a curious light on the penetration of the Italian Renaissance into Germany. Engravings, as we have
84. Apollo and the Muses
seen, were extremely active as agents in this process, even where, as at Nuremberg, the humanists-men like Celtes, Schedel, and Pirkheimer-were acting as advisers to artists... Thus, Schedel's Collectan.ea contains a drawing of Mercury which corresponds exactly to the has-relief copied by Cyriacus; 67 it was this drawing which inspired Diirer's Gallic Hercules.18 With the frescoes of Francesco Cossa in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara, we reach the concluding stage of this evolution. As will he recalled,

these frescoes, painted around 1470, represent (or rather, represented, for several of them have been ruined) a complete astrological system, which we have already had occasion to analyze."' In the upper zone of the paintmgs reign the "masters of the months," as named by Manilius-that is to say, the twelve great Olympian deities. These
85. Venus 86. Venus and the Graces
gods, also, derive from the Alhricus tradition. The connection is not at fast obvious, because of the difference in presentation. The gods are no longer surrounded by their legendary companions, as in the Libellus illustrations; from a chariot, each deity dominates a crowd of figures that are mere mortals, dressed in contemporary costume. Near Minerva, a group of young women busy themselves with weaving and embroidery; and lovers embrace each other tenderly on the hanks of the river where glide Venus' swans. Each scene is thus organized according to the traditional scheme of the "children of the planets," and illustrates the thesis we have already seen evolving,"° namely,

that human beings share in the properties of the divinity who presides over the month of their birth. But though the artist has followed the ast1ological tradition in his compositions, his types conform to the p1esc1iptions of medieval mythography.61 Thus Venus, though she is not shown swimming in the sea, is still c1owned, as

feet kneels a warrior, attached to her chariot by a chain. Who would recognize Mars, the terrible, in this gallant knight who, as the code of courtly love prescribes, kneels before his lady, at the mercy of her glance? He might he a Lancelot, even a Lohengrin. This group invites comparison with a Flemish miniature,63 or with a curious salver in the Louvre, which expresses, in a somewhat crude form, the sovereignty of Venus over the knights of all history."' This cunversion of an antique fable into a romance of chivalry 05 gives ample proof of the degree to which the court of Ferrara was impregnated with Occidental culture. But all this, it will he said, hardly seems like a reversion to classicism. This is true; the Ferrara Mars and Venus, as well as the Minerva, Jupiter, and Cybele, look indeed so much like the ladies and gentlemen of their entourage that if they descended from their chariots they might easily he mistaken for any of these. But it is precisely this familiar association between men and gods that is symptomatic of the new time; its significance will become more clear if we compare the Schifanoia frescoes with the miniatures of a Flemish manuscript of the same period."" In one of these miniatures, which represents Diana, a profane personage has joined the cortege of nymphs-but in how humble a fashion! He is shown as a tiny figure, timidly kneeling in a corner in the pose of a donor,°7 looking as if he felt completely out of his element in this fabulous world. At Ferrara, on the other hand, the contemporary figures seem to consider the presence of the gods as the most natural thing in the world; the gods, for their part, do not appear ill at ease in the midst of this little Italian court--and they ought, by

qualities reappear. They reappear first of all in the proportions and modeling of the three bodies: these youthful nudes, though still slightly frail and meagre, mark a step on the way to full plasticity. But it is above all the composition that merits our attention. The antique motif of the three Graces, which goes back to the end of the fourth or the beginning of the third century B.C., had undergone a gradual disintegration during the Middle Ages. In the twelfth century, the "Mythographus tertius" (Albricus) still described it correctly, in the manner of Servius (Aen., I, 720; ed. G. Thilo [1881], pp. 199 f.): two of the figures are seen from the front, the third from the back, and all three hold one another by the arms:
Quarum prima quidem nobis aversa, sed ambe Ad nos conversos oculos vultusque tenebant lnnexae altemis percandidis brachia nodis
as Petrarch was later to say in his polished hexameters... But in Bersuire the tradition alters: their arms are no longer linked, and two of the figures are seen from the back. This explains why, in a great number of manuscripts of the Ovide moralise, in the Tarocchi, and even in the Practica musice of Gafurio,1° they merely stand side by side, two seen from behind or in profile. In the Libellus, it is true, two again face the spectator, but they are still shown as separate figures, frolicking each by herself in the sea. Furthermore, the one who turns her back is not the one in the center; this detail is significant. It has not arisen through an error, for the text says only: "Ex quibus duarum facies versus nos adverse erant, tercia vero dorsum in contrarium vertebat." 11 No text, furthermore, expressly indicates the relative positions of the three goddesses. What has happened is rather that the artist has lost his concern for certain aesthetic laws. If the anonymous painter to whom, according to Pausanias, we owe the original motif of the three Graces,"" placed the girl whose back is turned between her two companions, it was for reasons of

THE REINTEGRATION OF THE GODS 209
alternation and balance: it was these qualities which gave the group its significance. In the Middle Ages on the other hand, its meaning was derived mainly from the supposed moral content-from the principle, that is, to which the group seemed to give ingenious illustration: "A benefit conferred is twice repaid." For this, it was enough that any one of the Graces should tum her back to the spectator; her place with reference to the other two was a matter of no interest, since it did not affect the meaning. With Cossa, the three Graces have returned once more to their original positions and posture; their interrupted round has been formed again. The graceful inflection of their bodies, the bending of their heads, and the garland of their intertwined arms once more begin to outline in space their lovely curves, their "enceintes magiques"-to compose "un petit temple rose et rond, qui toume lentement, comme la nuit." 73 We now see all that is implied in the restoration of this classical group-the renewal of an order, the reawakening of a harmony. By way of this literary tradition, of which his work marks the final outcome, Francesco Cossa has regained contact with the pure plastic tradition of antiquity. His Graces are sisters to those of Raphael.74
*
AND so WE have gradually arrived at the threshold of the Renaissance. By way of a long and laborious evolution, artists have at last begun to restore an ideal youth to the antiquated medieval models; or, more often, they abandon these models in favor of the statues and bas-reliefs which now smile at them with a beauty undimmed by time. The gods who return to people the vaults and walls of the Farnesina, all more or less freely inspired by antiquity," seem to have been reinstated overnight in all their ancient splendor.

But this dazzling revenge should not make us forget the centuries which have been needed to bring it about. Sometimes, indeed, at the height of the Renaissance and of the gods' new glory, some sign or detail will intervene to remind us of their long years of exile and adventure. In the church of San

Domenico, :in Naples, the funeral chapel of the princely Caraffa family is ornamented with has-reliefs executed around 1512, on which the constellations are represented. For the most part these reliefs reproduce the beautiful clas• sical types of the first Aratea, but in the hand of Perseus we see, instead of the Medusa head, the head of a bearded demon (fig. 90). This detail recalls the hero's strange past: the head which he holds is a remnant of the disguise imposed on him by the Arabs. It proves the survival, in Italy,'0 of the pictorial tradition with its century-long process of change. Some vestiges of the literary tradition also survive. Between 1540 and 1545, Jacopo Sansovino made four admirable statues for the Loggetta in

Venice which are still to be seen there: Apollo, Mercury, Pallas., and Peace." There is a singular contrast between the first two figures: Apollo, in his radiant nudity, recalls the Apollo Belvedere; Mercury, in a tunic, wears a triangular hat and soft boots. He has no other attribute, but his right foot rests on the severed head of Argus (fig. 91). We recognize this Mercury, whose history we know: he is the Mercury of the Tarocchi, in whom the traits of the archaistic Hermes were so oddly combined with those of the medienl type transmitted by Albricus.7"

THE PRECEDING study has rested upon a too restricted and specialized body of material to serve as a basis for general theories and laws. It does, howe,·er, authorize us to define more exactly, or to rectify, certain ideas and termsfirst of all, the very notion of "Renaissance" itself. In the light of these analyses, the Renaissance appears as the reintegra• tion of antique subject matter within the antique form: we can speak of a Renaissance from the day Hercules resumed his athletic breadth of shoulder, his club, and his lion's skin. Not for a moment is there any question of "resurrection"; Hercules had never died, any more than Mars or Perseus. As concepts and as names, at least, they had survived tenaciously in the memory of man. It was their appearance alone which had vanished, Perseus living on in his Turkish disguise and Mars as a knight of chivalry. Nor must we conclude too hastily that the classical form under which the gods had once been known had completely disappeared from view. In spite of long periods of eclipse, it survived during the Middle Ages-as a memory maintained and revived at certain privileged epochs by the sight of ancient ruins and the reading of the poets.111 Better still, a vivid feeling for

212 THE SURTIIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
sculptural beauty in the representation of the gods breathes through some verses written in Rome in the twelfth century by Hildebert de Lavardin:
••• Hie superum formas superi miran:tur et ipsi Et cupiunt fictis vultibus esse pares. Non potuit na,tura deos hoc ore creare Quo miranda deum signa creavit homo JIultus adest his nu.minibus potiusque coluntur Artificium studio quam dei.tote su.a.80
The gods are jealous of their own statues; they it is, and not the gods themselves, that inspire devotion. This admiration did not remain a matter of words only. Certain aspects of medieval sculpture give evidence of an effort to perpetuate or to rediscover the ancient canon of beauty; and if the understanding of the plastic gen• ius of antiquity is frequently of only a superficial order, at other times-in Rheims, for instance, in the first years of the thirteenth century-it is intimate and profound. But at Rheims it is no longer the gods who are represented; instead, saints and virgins stand before us, draped in their noble and tranquil majesty. The formal qualities from the past, like the togas and peplums, serve to clothe new ideas; they now belong to Christian subjects. This observation may appear somewhat less obvious if we recall that the manuscripts have presented the opposite phenomenon, that of the pagan gods taking on contemporary costume and even ecclesiastical attributes and gestures. Have we not seen a tonsured Jupiter, a mitered Mercury-whereas one or another of the Rheims Virgins might easily be taken for a priestess of Vesta? These examples--chosen from among the extreme cases-highlight the process of disintegration or dissociation which in reality had begun in the last centuries of antiquity. Form and subject survived in isolation, so to speak, each distinct from the other. As pagan ideas gradually became severed from expression in art, Christian ideas came forward to inhabit the forms

THE REINTEGRATION OF THE GODS 218
thus abandoned, just as the Christian cult took over the empty temples or the imperial baths. And the heroes of Fable, for their part, at length sought shelter within the priest's robe or the knight's armor. In this strange game of changing places, Christ may become a Roman emperor, an Alexandrian shepherd, or an Orpheus,81 and Eve a Venus. On the other hand, Jupiter may appear as one of the Evangelists, Perseus as a St. George, Saturn as God the Father. But no god is now represented in his traditional form as a divinity. \The mythological heritage, like the classical patrimony as a whole, has so disntegrated that in order to take stock of its remains, we find it necessary to distinguish between a pictorial and a literary tradition which had become completely separate. Neither tradition, by itself, was able to keep intact the memory of the gods. Without a pictorial model as corrective and support, the descriptions of the mythographers were powerless to evoke their true forms; but even where the model had been handed down, it could engender only more and more debased replicas, since understanding of the subject had been obscured or lost.•• Linked together, and checked one against the other, these two traditions would have made it possible to rebuild the unity of ancient art; this, indeed, is what took place when the :figures of the constellations first began to regain their mythological significance, and as the bizarre types issuing from Albricus took on once more the gestures and proportions of statues. More than once during the Middle Ages, a revival of ancient arts and letters appeared to he coming about, and went far enough for us to be able to refer to the Carolingian period and the twelfth century as having been, each in its own way, a "Renaissance.\• It is quite true that the two traditions moved nearer together at those moments: there were scholars capable of explaining the sarcophagi to the artisans who copied them, while the same scholars, like true humanists, observed the ancient marbles and made collections of works of art."' Thus the Renaissance, rightly seen, is in no sense a sudden crisis; it is the end of a long divorce. It is not a resurrection, but a synthesis.

2H THE Sl:RV/1'AL OF THE P.4GA.\' GODS
Fao:.t another angle, what we have said of the migrations of the gods throws light at certain points on the part played by Italy. Italy's role was of capital importance, hut it differs slightly from the one usually attributed to her. First of all, Italy received a great many classical themes from outside sources; this is particularly striking in the case of the gods. Not all the ancient divinities were reborn, as has usually been imagined, on the soil where they once reigned; they returned from distant exile, some after strange detours. It is impossible to overestimate the significance of Petrarch's having turned to an Englishman, "Alhricus," as his authority in delineating the figure of Jupiter or Neptune--Petrarch, the greatest Italian humanist of the fourteenth century. Furthermore, it was not merely her own indigenous deities that Italy thus received from abroad; the legends of other nations came to her as well. When, in the Trecento, Guido delle Colonne revived the Roman de Troie, he was merely adapting the work of Benoit de Sainte-Maure, a French poet of the twelfth century; similarly, the Faits des Romains, which recounted the exploits of their ancestors to the Italians of the late Middle Ages, were composed in Paris in the fust years of the thirteenth century.81 Thus, contrary to all expectation, it is not always on classical soil that classical memories have remained most alive; more than once it happens that material from antiquity turns up in Italy not as a direct heritage, hut as an imported product. At all events, it will be said, Italy transformed this material and reassimilated it, This is of course true, but not of Italy alone. The countries of the North and West, which played so essential a role in the conservation and transmission of antique themes, contributed also to the restoration of forms. We need hut recall the curious experiments of the German artists who, in the fifteenth century, began again to copy the Carolingian manuscripts; or the decisive corrections made by Diirer in the types of the stellar divinities;

However, Flutre pomts out that the legend of Caesar, the last to appear 1n France -fter the tales of Alexander, Thebes, Troy, etc.-preceded the others m Italy, for the very reason that there Caesar had the character of a •'national" hero.



THE REINTEGRATIO/11 OF THE GODS 215
above all, the influence of French and Flemish naturalism on the Trecento and Quattrocento in Lombardy, Siena, and Florence. In this last respect, moreover, the story of the gods is but one episode in the general evolution of art: it has long since been shown •• that the ''Gothic" spirit coming from France, Flanders, and the Rhine valley breathed over Italy as early as the Trecento, and made itself felt down to the sixteenth century. This was one of the influences which "awakened" Italy, and prepared her to understand the teachings of her own past. Admittedly, the mere mention of a Niccolo Pisano, and later of a Ghiberti, should be enough to prevent us from pushing this view to the point of paradox; these names should also remind us that the evolution of art is not uniform, and that the sculptors were the first to discover truths toward which the painters were still groping. And lastly, as we have seen, it is sometimes difficult to determine the direction in which influences move: if those from the North and West, for instance, left their mark upon the Italian primitives, the French illuminators we1e in their turn influenced from the South. When Diirer is drawn toward the classical style, he has been preceded by Pollaiuolo and Mantegna, and is following their example. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the North prepared the way for the reintegration of the gods, furnishing the necessary elements and, in order to bring them to hfe, lendmg them something of its own blood and soul.

The Science of Mythology
in the Sixteenth Century
T
H E T R I u M PH of the ancient gods in Renaissance Italy and then in Europe as a whole, and the immense place which they occupy in the art and literature of the sixteenth century, have often been emphasized, but less often accounted for on specific grounds. By what means, through what channels, did the knowledge of mythology become so diffused that it took on the character of a veritable invasion? It has usually been thought enough to give some such reply as this: ''The ancient poets we1 e by this time in every hand. . • • The humanists drew their nourishment from Virgil and Ovid, profane Bibles which they knew by heart. The artists, for their pa1t, copied the reliefs and medals which the collectors were so avidly assembling. Thus the knowledge of Fable became mo1e and more widespread, and the images of the gods were multiplied." Actually, however, in the special case of mythology the men of the Renaissance did not always turn straight to the sources for their inspiration. We shall try to throw light on the obscure but extensive role played by certain intermediaries in making generally known the religious traditions of antiquity. These intermediaries were contemporary works, manuals and diction• aries in which information concerning the names of the gods, their outward aspect, and their adventures was made easily available to all readers. As we shall have occasion to prove later, men of letters and artists as well were often content with secondhand information of this kind. The disadvantages and dangers of the method are obvious, though no great harm would have re219

suited if the manuals had offered a true image of classical antiquity, based upon a judicious choice of texts and illustrations. But this was by no means the case. What is demonstrated in fact by even a superficial study of these works is that all of them, to a certain extent, derive from the Middle Ages and continue, both in spirit and content, that medieval mythographical tradition of which we have sketched the history.
*
THE CHIEF LINK between the mythology of the Renaissance and that of the Middle Ages is Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Gods.' The Genealogy, indeed, is essentially a work of transition- "simul ante retroque prospiciens," looking both forward and backward, to use an expression of Petrarch's. In date, in general conception, in sources and method, it still belongs to the Middle Ages, yet here and there symptoms of the new time may he found. Boccaccio undertook the work at the request of Hugues IV, king of Cyprus, toward the middle of the fourteenth century, and devoted to it the last twenty-five years of his life. Its range greatly exceeds that of the earlier compilations; • hut in its very breadth the plan of the work recalls the great medieval encyclopedias, the tresors, mirozrs, or mers des histoires, while the attempt "to reduce the whole of classical mythology to a system, and to bring each god, demigod, and hero into connection with the mighty father of the race, marks Boccaccio as a child of the Middle Ages." • Let ~a see from what materials the work is composed. Boccaccio would have us believe that he always obtained his materials at first hand. In the Dedicatory Epistle he claims that he knows no other study of the subject; furthermore, it would be absurd to look in minor rivulets for what can be drawn from the main spring: "lnsipidum est ex rivulis quaerere quod possis ex

fonte percipere" (xv, 7). Both affirmations are exceedingly ill-advised. The reader soon sees: (1) that Boccaccio's knowledge of classical literature is for the most part indirect; (2) that he has not scrupled to make extensive use of his predecessors' works. Certainly, he knows a little Greek; he ha& heard Leonzio Pilato read from the original text of Homer, and takes legitimate pride in the fact.' But his quotations from the Greek generally derive from Latin authors, or even from medieval compilations. With the Roman poets and prose writers, Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, Seneca, he seems to be familiar; but in many mstances he has read them or quotes them by way of writers from the period of decadence, even when the originals were immediately accessible to him. He quotes Ovid, for example, from Lactantius and Theodontius. Much of his material comes to him from Apuleius, Servius, Macrobius, and Martianus Capella; much also from the Fathers of the Church, especially Lactantius and St. Augustine. He even draws occasionally upon the encyclopedists, from Isidore to Rabanus Maurus and Vincent of Beauvais. Lastly, he utilizes the treatises devoted to mythology alone, and even those of most recent date--not only Hyginus and Fulgentius, but also his immediate precursors, i.e., Albricus, whom for that matter he holds in high esteem,° and another and most mysterious figure whom he calls Theodontius.6 This Theodontius, whose work has been lost, was still completely unknown to Hortis;' Hauvette supposed 8 that he was some "Latin compiler of the extreme decadence"; but Carlo Landi in his monograph O is more pre
~ "Meum est decus mea est gloria, scilicet inter Ethrusoos Graec1s ut1 carm1mbus." And he adds, "Ets1 non sat1s plene perceper1m,
percepi tamen quantum potui." ("It 1s my privilege and my glory among the Tuscans to make use of Greek poems. . • • If I did not understand everything, at least I perceived as much as I could") • He Cites him frequently· thus, in the Italian edition of G. Betuss1 (1606), p. 143: "Et Alberico ••• afferma ella (G1unone) aver allevato Nettuno"; p. 144: "poi come dice Alberico"; p. 145: "dice poi Albenco ••• tesllmonia Alberico • • • Favoma poi, secondo Alber1co"; p. 148: "Secondo Alber1co," etc.

222 THE SURFfTIAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
cise. Theodontius was probably a philosopher of Campanian origin who wrote between the ninth and eleventh centuries. He furnished Boccaccio with the debris of a curious and very mixed tradition; he knew the Olympic pantheon, but there are also signs of a syncretistic mythology, memories of the cosmogonic speculations of the Greek philosophers, and even fragments of a Greek historian of the fourth century B.c.1° It is to Theodontius that Boccaccio owes his famous "Demogorgon," whom he presents as founder of the whole race of gods,11 but of whom classical antiquity never heard. Demogorgon is a grammatical error, become god.12 This detail alone should serve to put us on our guard as far as Boccaccio's documentation is concerned, and his independence with regard to his sources. As a matter of fact, Boccaccio treats all the authorities and histories which he uses as equally reliable. His own claim is of course quite different -as with regard to Jason, for instance. "Verum ego," he says, "plus fidei antiquae famae exhibeo: qua hahemus Jasonem Esonis fuisse :/ilium, quam auctori novo" (xm, 31)." But this declaration of principle does not prevent him from following the Latin poets rather than Homer (1x, 2; XII, 15), or from confidently quoting opinions as late as those of Gervase of Tilbury. Similarly, we find him rejecting this or that fable because of its improbability, and in the next breath accepting some no less absurd fabrication. Basically, all writers of the past, Christian or pagan, inspire him with the same reverence: they are, without exception, recipients of wisdom from on high. It is in this respect that, in spite of stirrings of a mo1e critical spirit, he remains essentially a man of the Middle Ages. Through his method of interpretation, also, he places himself in the same category. In the first place, he is not concerned with resolving the contradictions that he notes in his authors or in the myths themselves; his busi

ness, he expressly says, is to record all this, not to unravel it: "If these things and others are erroneous, it is not my intention to disprove them, nor to correct them in any way, should they not lend themselves to some kind of orderly redaction. I shall be content with reporting what I have found, and shall leave philosophical controversies aside." 14 He will not even attempt explanations: "nedum explicare queam" (vn, 24). At the most, following an expedient already practiced by Cicero and the Stoics, and transmitted to him by Theodontius, he makes an effort to reconcile conflicting versions of the same myth by recognizing that the same name has been applied to several different deities-to three Jupiters, four Minervas, five or six Bacchuses. But on the other hand, however passive and timid he may be in analyzing the content of the fables, he shows abundant energy and boldness when it comes to reading meanings into them. Convinced as he is that the chief raison d'etre of a poem is the sense hidden under its surface (xrv, 10, 12), he develops Rabanus Maurus' idea that there may be several ways of interpreting the same story. Thus the fable of Perseus decapitating the Gorgon and rising into the air with the help of his winged sandals may be taken literally, as the account of an actual happening; morally, as a symbol of the wise man's ascent to virtue after his conquest of sin; or allegorically, as a symbol of Christ triumphant over the Prince of this Wodd and rising toward His Father. We recognize this method; 15 we have followed its applications from Phornutus to Fulgentius, from Ridewall to the moralizations of Ovid. Here, too, Boccaccio borrows from his predecessors. For example, he takes from Fulgentius his allegorical interpretation of Antaeus, image of earthly lust which the virtuous man can overcome only by chastity (r, 13). But he yields

224 THE SUR'PIV AL OF THE PAGAN GODS
nothing in ingenuity to the earlier writers when he himseli allegorizes on his own account: Pasiphae, daughter of the Sun, is the soul, child of God; her consort, Minos, is human reason, which governs the soul and leads it along the right path. Venus, her enemy, is lust; the hull represents the pleasures of this world, and from the union of the soul with pleasure is hom the Minotaur, the vice of bestiality (Iv, 10). This approach-which consists in a determination to reveal edifying meanings everywhere, come what may-is in line, moreover, with the dictates of prudence. In showing the great lessons of Christian morals beneath the pagan fables, Boccaccio is safeguarding himself against criticism or reproach on the score of impiety. He is careful, furthe1more (and there is no question of his sincerity), to give constant assurance of his orthodoxy 18 in order to ward off attack from the theologians. Thus, in spite of some symptoms of a new spirit, the Genealogy is still rooted in the medieval past, which nourishes it and animates it. This in no way detracted from its contemporary success or its wide circulation, which are attested by the large number of manuscripts and, after the invention of printing, the lazge number of editions h1ought out in Latin," Italian, and Spanish.1" It became, and remained for two centuries, the central storehouse from which educated men drew their knowledge of the gods.
*
IT WAS NOT, indeed, until the middle of the sixteenth century that Italy saw a renewal of the authentic mythographical tradition. It is a curious fact that the Renaissance, in its most brilliant phase, produced no work in this :field-the reason perhaps being that the very contact with and immediate intuition of antiquity rendered such scholarly aids unnecessary. Perhaps, also, other publications, besides the Genealogy of Boccaccio, were a response in at least a provisional manner to the needs of the time. What were these publications? Were they perhaps, as might he imagined, the most important classical texts, made generally available through the

advent of printing? No; this was not the case. Indeed, the troth of Michelet's verdict must be acknowledged: "Printing at first served for little more than to propagate and assure the survival of barbaric literature. • • . Though some classical works were published, they were far outnumbered by the recurrent editions of medieval writings, especially the textbooks, the Summae, the precis or abridgements." ,. As a matter of fact, printed editions of ancient mythographers did appear, from the end of the fifteenth century on; but as Gruppe has observed,"0 with the exception of the De natura deorum, these were chiefly the works on which the Middle Ages had most thrived. Also, they were printed in an order almost exactly inverse to that of their true value: the Commentary of Servius (six editions between 1470 and 1475); Fulgentius; the Homeric Allegories of Palaephatus, the treatises of Heraclitus and Phornutus {Aldus, 1505); Macrobius {Macrobius "integer," Paris, 1515 and 1524; Basel, 1535; Lyons, five editions between 1522 and 1544). The Bibliotheca of Apollodorus was to appear only much later (1555). On the other hand, the medieval mythographers were constantly reissued. Aside from Boccaccio's Genealogia, the success of which we have described, and which continued to be the leading mythological source book through the first half of the sixteenth century, Martianus Capella, for instance, went into no less than eight editions between 1499 and 1599; the Images of the Gods of Albricus and the Libellus de imaginibus deorum were brought out, the first at the end of the fifteenth cen• tury (Rome, c. 1480; Florence, c. 1492, and 1495-1500; other editions: Vienna, 1510 and 1523; Rome, 1510; Basel, 1549 and 1570; Paris, 1578; Lyons and Geneva, 1608, etc.), the second in 1520 (Paris, Jean de Marne£: Allegoriae poeticae seu de veritate ac expositione poeticarum fabularum libri quatuor Alberico Londoniensi authore nusquam antea impressi). The Libellus, which, as we have seen, was attributed to Albricus from the fifteenth century on, was presented to the public in glowing terms:

Making due allowance for rhetoric and for the desire to publicize the work, there would still seem to be a certain effrontery--or a strange blindness-in proffering "Albricus" as a rival of Phidias, and in claiming that he copied the gods "d'apres nature." *
THESE VARIOUS treatises, of ancient or more modern date, were several times brought together in collections where mythographical, allegorical, and astro• nomical texts of very unequal value were juxtaposed. Thus the Libellus, supposedly by Albricus, appeared in Basel in 1549 together with the Fables and the Astronomy of Hyginus, Palaephatus' On Incredible Things, the Mythologies of Fulgentius, Phornutus' allegorical On the Nature of the Gods, the Sphere of Proclus, and the Phenomena of A1atus." Later;J this same collection was to be enriched by the new History of the Gods of Giglio (Lilio) Gregorio Giraldi (Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus); later still,"' through resumes and commenta1ies by Mac1ob1us, Marsilio Ficino, and a contemporary mythographer, Conti.'"

half of the sixteenth century were either the authors whom the Middle Ages had read, or the medieval authors themselves.
*
NEVERTHELESS, need began to be felt for a more systematic treatment which would collect these scattered notions and bring them into some kind of order, replacing the old Genealogy, which in the meantime continued to do fairly good service. Some works which appeared in the first half of the century prepared the way for this new "codification" of mythology: thus, dictionaries of ancient proper names, like that of Robert Estienne,"' performed a certain summarizing function with regard to the material of Fable. Similarly, the books of "examples" or "lessons" (antiquae lectiones, or exemplorum libri)-that is to say, the haphazard compilations of anecdotes, sayings, and curiosities culled at random from ancient authors, to which the sixteenth century was as partial as the Middle Ages had been 28-usually contained a mass of detail concerning the pagan divinities. The model of the genre, the enormous Officina of Ravisius Textor,"' is a mine of information on the origins and pedigrees of the gods, their attributes, the places, offerings, and festivals sacred to them, etc.; moreover, it has its source m Boccaccio, for it again introduces Demogorgon.30 Lastly, the books of hieroglyphs and emblems, in which, as we have already seen, the gods played an important part,31 made a mass of information, citations, and even illustrations readily accessible to the reader; they thus offered, in their own way, the rudiments of a mythological compendium. Nevertheless, none of these works performed the service of a specialized and complete treatise.

228 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
It is to a German, Georg Pictor, that the credit belongs of having been the first sixteenth-century author to renew Boccaccio's undertaking-though, it is true, on a more modest scale. His Mythologi,cal Theology, appearing in 1532,12 and republished in 1558 as the Magazine of the Gods,'" is presented in dialogue form. Theophrastus, a professor, teaches his disciple, Evander, the names, appearance, and "allegory" of each god, beginning with the "Magni Dei" and arriving thereafter at the "Selecti," and the "lndigetes," or tutelary divinities. Evander is especially curious about the appearance of the gods: "Die imaginem!'' he insists, when the description has not yet been given. It is therefore on this point that Theophrastus dwells at greatest length. He usually offers several descriptions of the same god, based upon different authors and documents. Several of the authorities whom he invokes are old friends of ours: Fulgentius, Martianus Capella, and the Libellus (which Pictor paraphrases, when he does not copy it word for word)."' We find him basing a description of Juno on the statue by Polycletus of which Pausanias speaks, or even on a medal of Faustina (p. 19). But these types are a little too familiar to satisfy Evander, who demands something new and rare: "Habes ab hac aliam minus communem?" (p. 12). To satisfy this taste, Theophrastus sometimes leaves Greece and Rome to hunt for less well-known images in the East (fig. 94). Thus, in treating of the great Greco-Roman gods, he does not fail to call attention to their Oriental equivalents: the "Assyrian" Apollo, with basketlike headdress, or the bearded Cypriote Venus. He even devotes several chapters to the Egyptian gods: Isis, Osiris, Harpocrates, etc. Here we merely note the appearance of this exotic tendency, this mythology of other peoples ("exterarum gentium," says the title). We shall meet with it soon again.

As ea.ch description ends, Evander asks to have it explained,"' taking up one after the other various details of the god's features, clothing, etc. "Why has Jupiter no ears? Why does he hold a scepter in his left hand, thunderbolts in his right?" With untiring compliance the master provides the desired interpretation--sometimes a physical or cosmogonic interpretation, but more often an edifying or moral one. The book ends, as it began, with a completely orthodox expression of faith, a prayer to the true and eternal God of gods, to Him who "verus et sempiternus omnium deorum deus est." In short, Pictor's treatise falls thoroughly into line with the medieval tradition. It is related to the Libellus by its descriptive 94.

BETWEEN 1548 and 1556 there appeared, one after the other, three Italian manuals of much greater importance, both in size and popularity. These are: The History of the Gods, by Lilio Gregorio Giraldi: De deis gentium varia et multiplex historia in qua simul de eorum imaginibus et cognominibus agitur, etc. (Basel, Oporinus, 1548).

The Images of the Gods, by Vincenzo Cartari: Le imagini colla sposizione degli dei degli antichi (Venice, Marcolini, 1556).
It would be well to recapitulate briefly what is known of these three authors, of their lives, work, and reputation among their contemporaries. Lillo Gregorio Giraldi is one of the great figures of humanism."' Born at Ferrara in 1479, he led a wandering existence, encountering many setbacks of fortune. In Naples, he became the friend of Pontano and Sannazaro; in Milan, he studied Greek under Demetrios Chalcondylas {1507). In Modena, he became the tutor of Ercole Rangone; when Rangone was made a cardinal, Giraldi accompanied him to Rome, where he had lodgings in the Vatican (1514). There his reverses began: his ambitions were frustrated, his health began to fail. Then came the disaster of the sack of Rome in 1527; he lost all his possessions, even his books. As the crowning misfortune, Cardinal Rangone died in the same year. Giraldi then sought refuge with Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola, but this patron was assassinated in 1533. Ill, embittered, without resources, he then returned to his native city, where the benevolence of Duchess Renee and the friendship of Manardi and Calcagnini rescued him from want and brightened his latter years. He died in 1550 or 1552. Author of Latin poems, of the celebrated Discourse against Letters and the Literati, which expressed his bitterness and disillusion,38 an? of several learned works (Treatise on the Muses, On the Enigmas of the Ancients and the Pythagorean Symbols, On the Years and Months, Historr of the Poets of Antiquity, etc.), he undertook his great History of the Gods only toward the end of his life--"senex et aeger .•. iam grandaevus et paene moribundus." He insists-and his editors will insist after him-on the painful conditions

under which he brings the work to an end,8" ravaged by gout which nails him to his bed, "gravato decumhens, saevissima arthritide correptus." Giraldi, whom Jensius, in the 1696 edition of his complete works, hails as one of the pioneers of the Renaissance,40 is, to quote Moreri, "generally regarded as one of the greatest geniuses produced by Italy in the last centuries." And, in fact, he was held in high esteem by the contemporary humanists Scaliger, Casaubon, and Vossius, while Montaigne writes: "I regard it as a disgrace to our century that we have, as I understand, allowed two men of the highest learning to die in extreme want: Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus in Italy, and Sehastianus Castalio in Germany." 41 We know less of the life of Natale Conti "-only that he was horn in Milan around 1520, and that after several years of study in Venice he returned to his native city, serving in the household of the jurist Gahrio Panigarola as tutor to his son, the future Fra Francesco Panigarola. Of his other relations, and his milieu, we know very little. He addresses verses to Venetian senators, composes a poem on the Hours for Cosimo de' Medici. He seems to have had correspondents and patrons in France, for he dedicates one of the editions of the Mythology to Charles IX."' In addition to the last-named work, he is the author of several translations (for example, of a Latin version of the Deipnosophistae of Athenaeus}, of Latin elegies in the manner of Ovid (Carmina), and-still in Latin-of a treatise on hunting (De vena.tione) and works on contemporary history (Commentarii de Turcorum bello in insulam

It is to his Mythology, apparently, that he owed his chief reputation; even so, his fame came late and was not undisputed. Moreri tells us that he passed for one of the most learned men of his time ("l'un des plus s~avans homrnes de son temps"); Heinrich Ursinus considers him the first of mythographers. But Scaliger refers to him disdainfully as a negligible compiler not worthy to be quoted:" Vincenzo Cartari, the third of this group of Italian mythographers, is a very mysterious figure. We know almost nothing of his life, except that he was horn in Reggio Emilia early in the sixteenth century. Like old Giraldi, he was a protege of the dukes of Ferrara, and probably lived in their entourage.•• He dedicated his treatise on the gods to Luigi d'Este, as Giraldi had dedicated his to Ercole II. Furthermore, through his publisher, Marcolini, he must have been in contact in Venice with the circle of humanists surrounding Aretino. All of Cartari's works are in the vulgar tongue; aside from his Images of the Gods, he was author of a translation of and commentary on the Fasti of Ovid (Fasti d:Ovidio tratti alla lingua volgare, 1551; ll Flavio intorno ai fasti oolgari, 1553), and of an abridgement of Paolo Giovio (ll compendw dell'istoria di M. Paolo Giovio, 1562). The name of Cartari is l'arely mentioned by his contemporaries; nevertheless, Armenini cites him as an authority:• and Lomazzo recommends his Images to artists." As we see, the three mythographers were by no means equal in celebrity, but the success of their works was not directly related to the more or less brilliant place which they occupied in the history of humanism and the opinion

THERE IS no need, we feel, for separate analyses to be made of the History of the Gods, the Mythology, and the Images, since the resemblances between the three works greatly outweigh the differences. Let us note merely: 1) That Giraldi, the earliest in date," undoubtedly influenced the other two; Natale Conti, it is true, affects not to know him, and even feigns amazement that "no one, up to this date, has undertaken a comprehensive explanation of these fables, based on the ancient authors" (I, 1) ; this attitude, which rightly amazes Tiraboschi (VII, 195), is proof not so much of ignorance on Conti's part as of an excessive vanity, which we shall have occasion to note elsewhere; 00 Cartari, on the other hand, willingly acknowledges his borrowings from Giraldi-borrowings so extensive that Lessing could regard him as a plagiarist." 2) That they bring different aptitudes and aims to bear upon a common subject: Giraldi, the learned philologist, concentrates upon names, epithets, etymologies, to the detriment of the myths themselves; Conti professes himself a philosopher, and takes special interest in a more profound interpretation of the fables; Cartari is essentially an iconographer-his dominant if not exclusive preoccupation being to describe the gods. With these reservations, we may place the three works on the same level and look at them collectively. For, in spite of appearances, none of them represents a really decisive advance over the earlier t1eatises; not one contains
48 This will be shown as we study the dissemination of the three works, Book II, chaps. 1i and iii, infra.
•• Ill-informed critics have tried to maintain the contrary. Scipione Casah (cited in the Dici,onnaire univer•el, article Carlart) affirms that "Cartan was the first writer after Boccaccio to summon mythology from the obscurity into which 1t bad fallen· in fact, the Latin works on the same subject by L G.
Giraldi and N. Conti did not appear 1111 several years later." The dates given above
show that this assertion 1s baseless.

h CANNOT be di ,puted that the information brought forward by these authors is broader, and their erudition more self-assured. But in their choice and classification of sources, they abide by the medieval habits. Although they have a better and more direct knowledge of classical writers-Conti, for instance, borrows extensively from the Greek tragediansthey continue to draw largely upon the late scholiasts and compilers, Hyginus, Servius, Lactantius Placidus, Macrobius, Martianus, Fulgentius; upon the Church Fathers and the encyclopedists; upon Albricus and Boccaccio;•• lastly, upon their own contemporaries-sometimes those who are least trustworthy. That Giraldi should evoke the authority of Politian, of Pico della Mirandola, Leon Battista Alberti, and Bude is certainly admissible. But he repeats the tales of a certain Alexander of Naples,03 whose fables are made use of by Pictor also and later by Cartari in describing the gods. At the same time, when carefully sorted, this confused mass of evidence is not without its value; for "it is not to the writers of the most brilliant period that the mythographer should turn for evidence; in order to recover the most genuine expression of a myth, one must look much earlier or much later." 114 There is a great deal to he gleaned from the mythographers of the late Empire, who were themselves gleaners. Even the compilers of the Middle Ages are not necessarily negligible: they may have collected the debris of myths which would otherwise have been lost... But did our Italian authors sift this

But not only are Martianus Capella .. and Fulgentius 65 cited in, extenso; they are even on occasion quoted in opposition to the classical authors themselves.

THE FIRST result of this mingling of sources is the surprisingly high proportion of barbarian or pseudo-antique divinities.

he thus appears. hut at the nuptials of Mercury and Philology. On the same plate, moreover, Zeus appears with his lightning and his eagle: thus the classical gods are brought together in surprising promiscuity with their hybrid descendants (fig. 92). As for the foreign gods, it should he recalled that our mythographers sum up and continue a syncretistic tradition; they turn for information above all to the last adherents of paganism-that is, to a period when ·all the cults were being merged and all the gods amalgamated. Medieval mythology preserved many traces of this intermingling: to speak of illustrated manuscripts alone, Monac. lat.14271 (11 v.) offers us a Cybele (who, admittedly, became a Roman goddess at an early period); the Rahanus Maurus of Monte Cassino, a Mercury-Anubis; '0 Palat. 1066 (224 v.), a Jupiter Ammon. In the Libellus, Apollo receives the signum triceps belonging to Serapis. But in our manuals, divinities of the Oriental cults are given extraordinary prominence, especially in Cartari. First of all, the Egyptians: Serapis, Osiris, Isis, Horus, Harpocrates, Anubis, Typhon, the ..Moon of Apollinopo· lis," the "Apollo of Elephantinopolis" (fig. 93); the Egyptian Jupiter, beneath the lotus; Canopus, the god formed like a vase. Then come the Syrian gods, Jupiter Ammon, the Assyrian Apollo, Hadad, Atargatis, the Phoenician Venus, Juno Syria of Hierapolis; then the gods of Asia Minor, the Black Stone, Jupiter Lahrandeus, also tho!'e of Persia (Mithra), and even those of Scythia and Arabia Petraea-Mars in i.he form of a stone, and Mars as a scimitar mounted on a pyre of wood. We have already had occasion to note in Pictor 71 the same unusual or even disproportionate place given to the Oriental divinities; it is due, in our opinion, to a contemporary influence-that of the "hieroglyphics," which drew the attention of humanists 72 to Egypt, and to the Orient in general.

or of what passes as such. Cartari describes a Celtic Jupiter, another borrowing from Alexander of Naples; following Pictor and Giraldi, he makes use of the Saxon Chronicle. In this source he finds many singular :figures,'" among others a Venus crowned with flowers, whose breast supports a lighted torch; her left hand holds a globe, and her right three golden apples (fig. 95). The history of this "Saxon" Venus is not easy to unravel. The Saxon Chronicle itself is a work by Conrad Botho (Bote). Under the title of Cronecken der Sassen it was first issued at Mainz in 1492 by Schaffer, with engraved illustrations; 17 but in an earlier French chronicle published in Paris by Pierre Le Rouge in 1488, La Mer des hystoires, which contains several chapters (XI to LX) on the gods, the following description is already to be found {p. Ix, col. 2): ..Selon Theoctetus, le simulacre et l'imaige de Venus estoit telle. Une femme nue de plaisant regard les cheveus pendans sur les espaules aiant une couronne de mirte sur sa teste entrelassee de roses vermeilles riant et aiant en sa bouche une autre rose vermeille. En son coeur une facule ou petite torche ardant et une sayete 78 de trois darts. Tenoit en sa senestre le monde divise en trois parties cest assavoir ou ciel terre et mer: en sa dextre trois pommes d'or." Of the mysterious Theoctetus we know nothing. As will be seen, the ancestry of this Venus is exceedingly doubtful. It is therefore all the more puzzling to find her in several sixteenth-century manuals of mythology besides those of Giraldi and Cartari. She appears in two German handbooks-the Theologia mythologica of Pictor, and the Heydenwelt of Herold-her presence being in these cases somewhat easier to explain.78

It should he added that later, early in the seventeenth century, the editors of Cartari were to publish as an appendix to the Images a discourse on the gods of Mexico and Japan.80 With this, Olympus, overrun from all sides, became sheer pandemonium.
*
IN ORDER to find their hearings in this motley array, it would have been necessary for the authors to introduce some kind of order, to organize the mate• rial along geographical and historical lines. But our mythographers are even more lacking in historical sense than in critical faculty. They pay no attention to place or time. They mix together all the gods, regardless of their place of origin, the most ancient with those of later times. Giraldi seems to have had some notion 81 of the importance of localizing the divinities, but not to have suspected any need for establishing their chronology. He outlines a geographical classification, but gives no thought to a division into periods. He does not even distinguish between Greek and Roman deities. Ideas of milieu and evolution are, admittedly, recent achievements, and it would be a manifest injustice to reproach scholars of the sixteenth century for not having possessed them. Furthermore, classical antiquity itself had by its own example encouraged intermingling and disorder. The ancients, who at so early a date had forgotten the meaning of their own myths, possessed no clear idea of their origin or relative age.

this point of view, their superiority over their predecessors is a purely rela
tive one.
*
THERE IS another domain, however, in which that superiority ought by rights to be absolute--the study and turning to account of figural monuments. In addition to the literary sources, our mythographers did, in fact, have at their disposal a documentation of infinite value which had been unknown to their medieval forerunners. When Pierre Bersuire, in the middle of the fourteenth century, apologized for having borrowed elements of his iconographical notes on the gods from his predecessors,"' he alleged in his own defense that he had no other choice--for, he said, he had been unable anywhere to find real images of the gods themselves: "quia deorum ipsorum fi.guras alicuhi non potui reperire." The defects of Boccaccio's Genealogy, as Tiraboschi rightly observes, stem from the same cause: "What could be accomplished at a time when there was so little knowledge of the monuments which would have served as the surest guide?" 88 Two centuries later, coins, reliefs, and statues had been excavated by thousands; collections were overflowing with marbles and bronzes; all this material was being listed, reproduced, made available. At the same moment as our manuals, in the very year of the first publication of Cartari (1556), the catalogue of Aldrovandi appeared as an appendix to the Antichita of Lucio Mauro: Tutte le statue antiche che in Roma si veggono. Collections were multiplying of icones statuarum, executed in the studios of Lafreri, Cavalieri, Franzini, and Vaccaria...
(Oxford, 1925). Certain writers even refuse to "venture" further, renouncmg 1nterpreta• t10D on the grounds that all effort to explain the myths presupposes a defuutive classdica•
tion (see, for example, J. Toutain, Studes de
mythologie et d'Jusioue [Paris, 1909], pp. 81-84, Nouvelles etudes de mytholog1e et d'h1stoire 11935]). Our sixteenth-century scholars, who make no attempt to class1fy, are on the contrary, as we shall see, eager to interpret. 87 See supra, pp. 174 f.

THE SURTl1V.4L OF THE PAGAN GODS
One would naturally expect to see Giraldi, Cartari, and Conti profit by this treasure which was within their reach. But Giraldi appears to he the only one of the three who thought of making direct use of it; he alone shows some familiarity with archeology. Doubtless his long stay in Rome was to a large

extent responsible for this, since there the vestiges of the past were daily before his eyes. We know that he saw two different statues of Neptune (p. 159: "sed et cum buccino et fuscina, qualem marmoreum vidi; . . • nunc nudus etiam cum tridente et concha, quo modo ipse conspexi"); at San Martino ai Monti he read the epitaph of an archigallus (p. 140). He visited private collections, those of Cardinals Salviati, Maffei, and Cesi, and others as well (p. 468: "Fortuna conservatrix e cippo utrinque insculpto et inscripto . . . Romae • • • in domo Marcellis Capicasi"; p. 385: "Isis triumphalis in marmore, in domo Cardinalis Caesii Romae," etc.). His friends kept him informed of the latest finds (p. 385: "Sane hujus modi simulachrum repertum Romae fuit, cum ego ibi op• timam viae meae partem ingratis contererem ..•"; ibid: "Isis Pelagia etiam cognominatur, ut datur intelligi ex marmore quodam vetusto, reperto in vinea Joannis Poggii pontificii quaestoris, extra portam Flaminiam"). While working on his history, he still took an interest in excavated objects, as for example in a statuette of Harpocrates found in Modena (p. 57: "His pro

It is also apparent that he knows some divinity types only from engravings. "I have seen," he says (p. 297), "in a book of antiquities an image of Mercury: youthful body, beardless face, wings above the ears; entirely nude except for a short mantle; in his right hand a pouch resting on a ram's head, in his left the caduceus; at his feet, a cock and a ram."

In Cartari's documentation, indeed, original works of art play a very small part.

But in reality even Cartari took from the medals lit• tle more than allegories: Virtue, Victory, Fortune, the genius of the Roman people.

composition of a Traite sur les images des dieu:ic, more classical in conception, it would seem,100 and less exclusively based on literary sources, than our Italian mythologies. Unfortunately, this treatise never saw the light of day.101 Archeology thus plays a singularly limited role in Cartari's documentation, just as it does in that of Giraldi himself. With Natale Conti, its role is nonexistent--or virtually so.1112 On the other hand, we often find in all three authors descriptions taken from other descriptions; this results when, instead of referring to works of art which they have actually seen, they copy what they have read in Philostratus or Pausanias. Thus, even in this domain, texts-and nearly always texts alone--are still their source of information.

mythographers as an essential part of their task."~ But they have no original system to apply. They revert to the three types of explanation offered by antiquity itself-historical, physical, and moral-the fortunes of which during the Middle Ages we have studied at length. They do not choose between these divergent explanations, being content in general merely to place them side by side. Giraldi, for example, is perfectly aware that the ancients were not in agreement as to the nature of Saturn tSrntagma rv): for some, Saturn was Heaven, or Time; for others, an early king of Italy; for still others, Fertility. But he does not linger over these contradictions nor choose between them; neither does he attempt to reconcile them. With Conti, this attitude becomes a veritable method. At the end of his book he adds, in condensed form, a summary in which the interpretation of each god is given according to the three traditional points of view-de ]oi•e historice, physice, ethice, etc.
At the same time, it is easy to see where Conti's own preferences lie. As a philosopher, he is convinced that mythology holds teachings of the highest wisdom, accessible, it is true, only to those who are not satisfied merely with the outward shell of the fables, their literal meaning: "ad exteriorem corticem fabularum, hoc est, ad simplicem omnibus obviam explicationem." 104 From the earliest times, says Conti (r, i), the thinkers first of Egypt, then of Greece, deliberately concealed the great truths of science and philosophy under the veil of m}1h in order to withdraw them from vulgar profanation. With this aim, they invented not only the stories of the gods, but even their very figures: it was they who gave the lightning to Jupiter, the trident to Neptune, bow and arrows to Cupid, the torch to Vulcan. Later, when it was possible for the great sages to teach publicly, without subterfuge, disclosing their precepts in the full light of day, the earlier vehicles of knowledge, the fables, seemed like nothing more than deceitful fiction or old wives' tales; but it is the task of the mythographer to recapture their original content. Pursuant to this principle, Conti makes his grouping of the myths depend upon the type of teaching to be found in them. Some myths contain se

crets of Nature: the myths of Venus, the Cyclopes, etc.; others, lessons of morality: man's duty to endure the vicissitudes of fortune (Phoebus herding the Hocks of Admetus), to be courageous (Hercules), and neither miserly (Tantalus) nor overbold (Marsyas), etc. Conti reverts to this distinction several times (1, vii: "Partim res naturae occultas habent; partim mores informant"), and the last book of his mythology, the tenth, concludes the demonstration which has been aimed at throughout: "quod omnia philosophorum dogmata sub fabulis contineantur." 1"' In the nineteenth century, Conti was hailed as a precursor by the religious historians of the symbolist school. Louis Menard, for example,'°" praises "the excellent work of Natalis Comes, much more complete and discerning than most of the treatises on mythology published since his day." In point of fact, Conti was anything but a precursor. On the contrary, in spite of his own denials, he is heir to an agelong tradition, the development of which we have followed down to Boccaccio,'01 and even to Pictor 108-the allegorical tradition, which persists in seeking the fruit of ancient wisdom beneath the "integuments" of Fable (Conti uses the word often). Thus Conti's mythological exegesis offers no innovation, and marks no advance. Is this to he wondered at? Bolder minds than his, coming after him, were enmeshed in the same errors. A critical genius like Francis Bacon, theorist of exact research, could still make every effort to discover the "sapientia veterum" hidden beneath the forms and adventures of the gods.'09 The thunderbolts of Zeus, stolen by Typhon and restored by Hermes, symbolize, he says, the authority and the fiscal power that a revolution sweeps away, but that may be recovered by eloquence informed with wisdom. Every youth who rushes forth to meet perils in reckless self-confidence is a son of the

250 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
Dawn, a Memnon to be mourned at sunrise--that is to say, at the outset of any great enterprise.110 However, in the last years of the sixteenth century an interesting evolution in the interpretation of myth begins to take form; at the root of this movement lies the powerful impetus given by the Reformation to Bible study. The false but fertile hypothesis that Hebrew was the first language 111 led, in fact, not only to the view that other languages were derivatives of Hebrew, but that the myths of other peoples were corruptions of the original revelation."" In this way foundations were laid for a kind of comparative mythology, which was to produce its monuments in the following century in the works of Huet, Bochart, and Vossius. It might he possible to see in Conti the very sketchy outline of an analogous method. In his first book (chap. vii) he hints at a theory that the gods, coming originally from Egypt, were imported into Persia and Greece, then into Rome, spreading from Rome over the entire rest of the world. But he does nothing to develop this idea.
*
IN SHORT, if a collective judgment of the three Italian manuals is to be offered, we must admit that, from the scientific point of view, they are far from marking any decided advance. Their extremely mixed contents are not critically sifted, not brought into order by an historical sense, nor illuminated by new hypotheses. Let us now examine their value from the aesthetic point of view. We must remember that each is, in fact, addressed to poets and artists, and, not content with supplying simply one more lexicon to aid in the comprehension of ancient works, undertakes to offer models and themes of inspiration.
110 Bacon doubt!- was under no great misapprehension as to the value of his interpretations. His allegoncal tendency is to be ex
plained in part by his lack of poetic instinct: he can see in mythology only intellectual concepts deliberately transfonned into sym
bols.. This was later to be the attitude of
Voltaire; cf. the D,c1,0111111ir• phuasophiqu.o, art. Fable: "The older the fables, the more allegorical they are."
111 See P. D. Hue!, Dwertab.on de l'ar,sine

Giraldi, for example, hopes that his work may be of use to painters and sculptors (Syntagma VII, p. 251): "Nunc igitur equos solis, quos illi poetae ceterique scriptores ascribunt, tibi assero, ut pictoribus et statuariis nonnullam opem his nostris Syntagmatibus afferamus." 113 With Cartari's Images, this becomes the essential object. The foreword of the publisher, Francesco Marcolini, is explicit enough on this point: "Many have written of the ancient gods • • • but none, until Vincenzo Cartari, has spoken of their statues and representations. This initiative will be agreeable and useful to all who take an interest in antiquity; it is also of a nature to be gladly welcomed by painters and sculptors, providing them with themes for a thousand inventions with which to adorn their statues and painted panels." Thus the work was meant not only to promote a better understanding of the ancient literatures ("ad intendere bene i poeti antichi e gli altri scrittori"), hut also, and to an even greater extent, to furnish subjects for artists. This must be insisted upon, for the author himself reverts to it incessantly. It sometimes happens, for instance, that he pauses over details of a fable which have no direct hearing on the representation of the gods, but he invariably catches himself up with the words: "This has no interest for those wishing to delineate this divinity." 114 Sometimes, on the other hand, he justifies digressions or long parentheses on the ground that they may serve an iconographical end. For instance, the story of the Vestal Claudia and the Magna Mater, if told at full length,116 could perhaps serve to inspire a painter of allegories: "della quale ho raccontato, perche questo fatto potrebbe servire a chi volesse dipingere la Pudicitia." 111 Cartari never loses sight of his mission as "provider of pictorial subjects," and herein lies, indeed, the chief originality of the Images, which is inferior to the History of the Gods and the Mythology in erudition and thought.
ua "Now then I am mentioning the horses of
the Sun, ascribed to him by poets and other writers, in order that this work of ours may
be of some help to painters and sculptors."

these I shall first tell what is to be read of them in Plato, since it seems to me most beautiful and dehght-provoking, and since it shows us how these three ought to be depicted. Therefore I have recounted all these thmgs after him, in order that anyone wishing
to represent one of the figures on his authonty, may have the necessary information."



252 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
It is therefore relevant to examine the value of the three treatises from the standpoint of art; let us ask what gods they present, and whether these gods might conceivably inspire the imagination of an artist.
*
IN THE MANUALS the place of honor is given, as we know, to divinities from the late periods, and especially those imported into Rome from the Orient. It is not the Olympians alone, but a complete barbaric pantheon which is summoned before our eyes by the illustrations in Cartari: ur the horrible three-headed Hecate (fig. 93); Aphroditos, the bearded Venus, with comb in hand; the Apollo of Elephantinopolis, with blue skin and ram's snout; the unspeakable Typhon, whose scaly body bows his soft, snakelike legs-in a word, creatures of the strangest and most misshapen sort, a nightmare mythology, the vision of St. Anthony in the desert.118 In comparing the religious imagination of the Greeks with that of the Orientals, Renan 119 observes the great difference in plastic quality. In the gods of the Orient, "conceived in the absence of all proportion," he decries especially the complex weight of allegory beneath which all form is stifled. "India sees no better way of extolling her gods than to pile up sign upon sign, symbol upon symbol; Greece, better inspired, fashions them in her own image: Helen, in honoring the Minerva of Lindos, offers her a cup of yellow amber made to the exact measure of her own breast." It is the very essence of the Oriental cults, in fact, to "sacrifice form to meaning." This is seen in late antiquity, when the Roman pantheon came to be filled with enigmatic and monstrous images-the same images which look at us from every page of Cartari's hook. As Cumont writes in this connec

tion,1"" "The Levantines impose on the plastic arts and on painting the complicated symbolism in which their own abstruse and subtle mentality delights. • • • The religious art of declining paganism does not aim at beauty. Increasingly, it obeys a tendency to give expression to learned ideas." Our manuals, in their manifest preference for the Eastern rather than the Olympic divinities-a preference furthe1ed by the contemporary Egyptomania and the taste for enigmas "'-consequently emphasize symbolism to the detriment of plastic sense. Artists are turned away from the pure nude forms of Greece toward the portrayal of terrifying or baffling allego1ies. By way of a parenthesis, a backward glance over the century may here be permitted us. We are already familiar with the dangers inherent in this type of inspiration: an illustrious example has brought them to our attention. When Agostino di Duccio started to represent the planetary deities in the Tempio Malatestiano, it was not always the Greco-Roman types which he adopted. His Jupiter, Apollo, and Mercury are disconcerting in aspect. The Jupiter, brandishing a whip in one hand and holding in the other a sheaf of wheat, is an Assyrian sun symbol, as described by Macrobius (Sat. r, 23: "dextra elevata cum flagro, in aurigae modum; laeva tenet fulmen, et spicas"). The Apollo is hardly less strange. He wears a shield on his back; one hand holds the three Graces, the lyre and laurel, and the other, the bow and arrows. He appears to be walking on a globe, with a swan and raven at his feet. This overabundance of attributes alludes in the main to aspects of the solar system, to the deadly or benevolent effects of the planet, etc. Porphyry has commented upon these effects, and explained them, in his study of the Egyptian cult of Osiris as the Sun.,,. As for Mercury, he is a sort of magus capped with a pointed bonnet. Small winged beings, who seem to emerge from a well, grasp the stalk of his enormous caduceus, about which are entwined four serpents; other similar puttini seem to slip and fall back. What is this figure, which belongs, as Yriarte remarks, to neither Rome, Greece, Assyria, nor Persia? It is reminiscent at once of Hermes, the guide of souls

254 THE S1.lRVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
to the underworld or psychopompos, and of the Egyptian Thoth, who teaches the soul to raise itself by degrees to a knowledge of divine things. Art historians have underlined the bizarre nature of these figures (whom, for that matter, they have not always recognized); 103 they have agreed in criticizing their "lack of composition, of solemnity, and of char• acter" (C. Ricci). But if the images betray a certain lack of ease, it is because of the difficulties encountered by the artist in attempting to impose the rhythm and unity, the vibrant harmony of the work of art, upon the complex and predominantly intellectual material of allegory. If he has not succeeded, in spite of a perceptible effort at stylization,,.. it is because the problem was by its very nature insoluble, at least for an artist of the South. Excess of meaningful content is a hindrance to plastic expression. After a certain level of symbolism has been reached, the balance between form and idea can no longer be successfully maintained.
*
THE PLACE accorded by the manuals to the Oriental mythologies would thus of itself justify certain fears as to the aesthetic value of the models which they propose. But another and more general consideration still further restricts that value, i.e., the:. fact that all the descriptions of monuments they contain are based on texts, and not on the monuments themselves. We have dwelt at some length on this point:,.. our three mythographers have read many more or less trustworthy authors, but with rare exceptions they seem not to have looked at statues or reliefs. As a general rule, their descriptions reproduce other descriptions; eK,pp!Xae1; are brought together,

recopied, juxtaposed-hut never, or almost never, brought face to face with a classical model. This method, which, as we have often said, seems paradoxical in midsixteenth-century Italy, develops its disastrous effects to the full in the illustrations of Cartari. Zaltieri, who designed the first engravings for the Images of the Gods, in 1571, does not once take his inspiration directly from the antique. His engravings are not copies of works of art, but reconstructions based upon written accounts. Frequently his gods are composite por• traits, made up from quotations given him in the text of the work itself. In this, it will he seen, Zaltieri proceeds exactly in the manner of the medieval illuminator. Just as the illustrator of the Libellus composed his Apollo out of extracts from Servius, Lactantius Placidus, Fulgentius, Martianus, or Isidore,12• so Zaltieri assembles the membra disiecta of the immortals, and combines them as best he can into awkward and baroque shapes. Sometimes, however, the text does provide a representation that is complete in itself, as when it cites Pausanias' detailed description of the works of art that he saw during his trip to Greece. At such times the engraver's task is easier, hut he does not necessarily achieve a happier result. Among such representations are the statue of Juno at Corinth by Polycletus (p. 180; Paus., II, 17, 4) ; the celebrated painting of the Cnidian Lesches at Delphi, where Polygnotus had depicted the demon Eurynomus (p. 279; Paus., x, 28, 7; cf. Decharme, Mythol., p. 392); Night, Sleep and Death, Diana, and the other sculptured images on the chest of Cypselos (pp. 336, 105, 265, 468; Paus., v, 18, 1, etc.).121 But however meekly Zaltieri may have followed the indications of the text, his figures have not retained the faintest Greek character--a deficiency which may he ascribed, without doubt, to the mediocrity of his talent, hut even more to his complete ignorance of classical style.""
126 See supra, pp. 177 f. 1.., Another image taken from Pausaniaa, but appearing only 1n the 1647 edition, revised by P1gnoria, is that of tbe Zeus of Phidias
(p. 87). The god is unrecognizable in tins "reconstruction"-as lamentable In its way as
that in the lapidary of AHonso X (fiB. 12). The Imagines of Pbilostratus also provided
Zaltieri with elements of several of the illustrations: Cornus (p 416), the Rivera (265),
Neptune (250), Bacchua (413,420,424,433). 1"" The greatest artists of the Renaiasance,
from Botticelli to Mantegna, Raphael, and Titian, attempted more than once to reconstruct or resuscitate masterpieces of ancient art, taking their mapirauon more or less literally from Phliostratus, Calliatratus, or

Cartari sometimes boasts, it will he recalled,''" that he has utilized marbles and medals as part of his documentation, hut actually it is in hooks, and only there, that he has seen them. His illustrator follows the same method. He copies, not the objects themselves, hut engravings from contemporary works: for medals, Enea Vico and du Chou!; 130 for has-reliefs and statues, Apianus.131 Thus, even his purported copies of antique objects are merely reproductions of reproductions. From this it will he seen that the Renaissance mythographers depart as widely from the original models as they do from firsthand documents, even when they claim to adhere to them most faith• fully. 13• On the whole, this mythology-to characterize it briefly-is both bookish and barbaric; seen in this light, it is antiaesthetic in a double sense. And lastly, it marks a striking regression, a return to the Middle Ages; it forces the gods hack into the matrix of allegory, decking them out again in the exotic finery which they had shed with such difficulty at the end of the earlier period. It interrupts the contact with classical art through which, from the fifteenth century on, the gods had been gradually regaining their incarnation in human shape.133 It is thus essential for us to investigate the extent to which the manuals were read, especially among the poets and artists for whom they were intended. If they were generally used, they must have influenced in curious ways the manner in which the declining Renaissance envisaged the gods and their world.

(see supra, p 252, n. 117), for the most part reproduces Zaltieri's plates. But he adds a certain number of new engravings, either in
the text or in the AGgiunte. Several of these
are still borrowed from works of contemporary
numismatists, Vico, Emzo, Agostmi; but
others are chrectly inspired by intaglios or cameos that Ferroverde has actually seen. He
even copies with remukable accuracy a Mithraic relief seen in 1606 on the Piazza de! Camp,dogho, and the Dw,a of Ephesus found

Theories Regarding the Use of Mythology
B
E F o RE Tu RN ING to the art and humanism of the declining sixteenth century for positive proof of the influence of the mythological manuals, we wish to show their appropriateness to the tastes and needs of the time. The books on the theory of the fine arts published in Italy during this period will provide the main material for such an investigation. These writings are of two kinds, the first group arguing from aesthetics and the second from theology. Both discuss at length the use properly to be made of mythological figures; they thus interpret for us the contemporary attitude toward the problem in which we are interested.
*
THE AUTHORS of dogmatic treatises on painting have much to say of the importance for the artist of consulting books in which he may learn how to treat the subjects which he himself chooses or which are proposed to him by others. These subjects, generally speaking, are drawn either from the Scriptures or from Fable; landscape, genre subjects, and historical scenes are almost never dealt with on their own account.1 Thus, information about the gods is indispensable to the artist. In his Precetti detla pittura,• Giovanni Battista Armenini enumerates the authors who, in his opinion, should he in every artist's library. After

258 THE sc:RrirAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
mentioning the standard authorities on sacred history, he recommends for the fables Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Gods, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and the work of "Alberico, cioe del Cartaro." This confusion between the names Albricus and Cartari is most peculiar. But above all it is striking to see the Images of the Gods put on the same level with that ''painters' Bible" of the epoch, the Metamorphoses.
The famous Lomazzo, in his Treatise on Painting,' devotes almost a whole book (vn) to the iconography of the gods, and says in conclusion: "Much else • . . can be in large part studied in the authors cited in the Genealogia [sic] dei Dei degli antichi and in the exposition of their images there presented by Vincenzo Cartari-the which I omit for reasons of space, it being too long a task to report them here. . . ." A few pages earlier,' in speaking of the image of Eternity, Lomazzo has already referred to Cartari as the translator of a passage from Claudian. He forgets, however, to tell us that all the poetic passages about the other gods that he quotes are likewise Cartari's translations. Above all, Lomazzo neglects to tell us that his own text, in the major part of that Book VII treating of the gods, is substantially Cartari's. In twenty-one chapters," he has done no more than to plagiarize the lmagini degli dei in abridged form. The fact that our critics feel it necessary to put books of this type in the hands of artists is remarkable in itself, for it exposes the artists' limitations of culture and imagination. Many of them were, in fact, ignorant men, or had received only a superficial education." This, however, is a minor fault (for surely the great Renaissance masters had not in every case been scholars!), but they also lacked creative force. This is why we find the artists of the time so often appealing to a learned adviser for aid,1 not merely in planning an entire work, but even in the execution of its slightest detail. One can easily imagine that the manuals of Boccaccio, of Giraldi, Conti,

and especially Cartari, to which they were referred by the arbiters of aesthetic taste, appeared to them as providential aids. It may he asked, of course, if the presence of so many men of letters capable of tracing the broad lines of the artist's canvas, and prodigal of detailed instructions, did not make it somewhat needless for him to consult a manual. When we study the great mythological cycles of the end of the century we shall have occasion to deal with this objection. One thing, at all events, is clear: the manuals became steadily easier to consult. The revisions that they underwent for each new edition shaped them more and more into the form of reference works or catalogues. Thus, the first edition of Conti's Mythology was already provided with an extremely clear table of proper names, referring, for each episode, not only to the page, hut to the line as well. In the 1581 Venice edition the lines are numbered. In the Latin edition of Cartari of the same date, the translator, du Verdier, emphasizes the convenience of the summary placed at the end of the volume, in which he has condensed "imaginum designationem absque explicatione, ex universo libro collectam." Indeed, du Verdier himself was one of the very writers who emphasized the usefulness of the work for painters; he even saw in this usefulness one of the reasons for its success. The 1608 Padua edition shows an even greater concern for making the hook easy to consult. Cesare Malfatti vaunts its clarity: the illustrations, instead of being confusingly mixed, will now be found "pin ordinate ed a luoghi suoi meglio accomodate." In opening the hook at a given picture, so he says, one will immediately grasp "its. meaning and its allegory, with the allegorical explanation of the animals and hieroglyphs, thus saving the trouble of reading two, three, or four pages in order to learn the meaning." The words "saving trouble" sum up the dominant preoccupa• tion, which is apparent in the illustrations as well. These are still Zaltieri's engravings, crudely reproduced. But beneath each one, an explanatory legend of several lines identifies the scene for the reader, or at least begins to make it intelligible to him. Furthermore, synoptic tables have been added at the beginning of the book: one page, divided in four compartments, presents



260 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
the ensemble of the gods--gods of the heavens, the sea, the infernal regions, and the forests. Another page brings together the four seasons of the year, with their attributes and the animals sacred to them. Lastly, Malfatti thought it best to add, as appendix, a "Catalogo . • . de 100 dei piu famosi Dei, loro natura e proprieta estratto da questo e altri autori• • • •" The intention is to make Cartari's work into a convenient sort of dic• tionary-album, easy of consultation when time is lacking to read text and references in their entirety.• Other contemporary works show the same tendency to select certain arguments from the whole body of mythology, then to classify and offer them in, as it were, predigested form "alli Poeti, Pittori, e Scultori." In addition to the abridgements of Ovid which are nothing but a sequence of pictures," we must note the Mytlwlogia of Tritonio, published in 1560. This aims to present the fables in a condensed and convenient form, thus making them generally accessible. "Dedi operam ut ex illius XV Meta• morph. libris fabulosa breviter colligerem exempla, atque ita in communes locos redigerem, ut in scribendis carminibus ad omnia £ere possint adaptari." 10 Is not such a universal passkey, generously prepared for the use of poets looking for inspiration, the counterpart of Cartari's gods who hold themselves in complete readiness and ordered array, at the disposal of artists in search of subject matter? Art, like poetry, looks to recipes and formulas for the vital sap which is beginning to fail it. Books like the Images and the Mythologia are an answer not so much to new needs as to new insufficiencies.

THE INSISTENCE with which theorists urge artists to read instructive texts illustrates another tendency of the period: its pedantry, or, in other words, its

taste for the niceties of mythological erudition. It is not thought sufficient, indeed, for the artist to have a general knowledge of the gods and the world of Fable; in this respect the theorists become more and more exacting and severe, always ready to underline "quam gravis, quam utilis et necessaria sit tota haec fabularis historiae cognitio." Raffaello Borghini's dialogue, ll Riposo, contains a most significant controversy on this subject.11 One of the interlocutors cites Horace:
Pictoribu.s atque poetis Qu.idlibet au.dendi semper fu.it aequ.a potestas • • •
But there is immediate agreement that artists abuse this license. A painter deserves blame for taking the slightest liberty with history or Fable, and especially for representing attributes or clothing inappropriate to the figures (p. 46). Such irrelevant details-·'cose disconvenevoli" detract from a picture more than they enhance it.1!! Then follows a complaint against Titian (pp. 48-58) for not respecting Ovid's original account in his representa• tion of Adonis trying to escape from the arms of Venus. On the other hand, Michelangelo has faithfully presented Night as the ancients depicted her, in giving her as attributes the owl and the crescent moon on her forehead. What, however, is to be said of his figures of Day, Twilight, and Dawn? These have none of the attributes assigned to them by good authors. It is thus an inexcusable fault for an artist not to give his figures the outward signs by which they may be recognized; it is no less serious, however, to make a mistake in the choice of attributes. And Michelozzo wonders if it is his ignorance which makes the pine garlands on Ammanati's statue of Neptune appear strange to him. Vecchietta then inquires to which god the ancients gave the pine as attribute. He cites in this connection Valeriano and Cartari (with whom, for the rest, he is not always in agreement). He goes as far as to distinguish (p. 51) between the pino and the arbore picea, "a species of pine very similar to the fir." Bringing forward a mass of quotations,

262 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
he obligingly explains that the pine belonged not only to Cybele, but to Bacchus as well, even though one rarely sees him with it as attribute. Sirigatto and Valori also enter the debate, and advance erudite hypotheses which show that they, too, are masters of the science of mythology. The insistence with v,hich the speakers harp upon the attributes of the gods is worthy of note, since it shows that to know them exactly is, in their eyes, a sine qua non of the painter's art. "If the painter wishes to give a perfect representation of Jupiter, he must first of all know who Jupiter is"; then he must give due attention to his "proportions, attitude, and coloring"; and "finally he must concern himself with the form of the god, by which he is made manifest and becomes recognizable: thunderbolts, eagle, scepter, costume, and all the attributes which have been given him by the poets." 1• Here we are shown the special notion of form held by theorists of this period; form was a matter of iconology, the science of "forme esteriori," and we know from Lomazzo himself "quanto il sapere la forma esteriore di ciascuna cosa sia non pur utile, ma necessario nella pittura." 1• He himself devoted some three hundred pages of his Treatise to a sort of universal iconography, and we have already called attention to his chapters on the pagan gods, which owe so much to Cartari's Images!" Though this concept of form has become almost completely foreign to us, we ought nevertheless to keep it very much in mind as we seek to appreciate correctly the works of art of this time. For the art lover of today, the subject represented is very much a side issue; as long as the eye receives pleasure, the expressive detail of the subject remains a matter of indifference to him. In the sixteenth century, the amorevolissimi della professione looked for something quite different in a painting. What mattered to them first of all was the idea which it embodied. Hence their extreme interest in the external signs by means of which that idea was given visual form, and especially in attributes, which to them were so many symbols of the thing represented. The eagle "signifies" Jupiter, and is inseparably part of his "form."

In visual representation, therefore, it belongs to the god as a muscle belongs to the arm. It is even incumbent upon the artist, in order to avoid all possibility of error, to multiply the marks of identity. From this it follows that he must first of all know them. The science of mythology is neither a complement nor an appendix; it is a region within the proper domain of art. If we add that Lomazzo, in the preamble of his Treatise, admonishes the painter to master the iconography "not only of the Greeks and Romans, but also of the Medes and Persians, and of all other peoples . . . ," 10 we are well justified in concluding that the mythological treatises of Giraldi, Conti, and Cartari satisfied all demands of a theoretical order. They were the very aids which the time demanded: manuals both learned and easy to use, en• abling everyone to reproduce correctly and without omissions the forms which were regarded as an essential element of art-their mythology extracted from the lesser-known authors," enriched by the most bizarre additions, and so offering opportunity for the artist to display his learning, and the public its ingenuity.
THE ATTITUDE of the theologians toward mythology is even more instructive than that of the art theorists. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Church, through her scholars or pontiffs, had uttered protests and warnings-more or less severe--against those who kept alive the memory of the gods.'" From the dawn of the Renaissance, this censure of the ''pagans" who glorified the gods was revived. The outstanding episodes in the reaction which followed this attack are well known. Coluccio Salutati, Petrarch's disciple, had already been driven to defend humanism against the reproaches of the Camaldolese monk, Giovanni da San Miniato, and the Dominican, Giovanni Dominici; the latter--like Gregory of Tours before him '"-lamented in his Lucula noctis that youth should be told of Jupiter and Saturn rather than of Christ and the Holy Ghost.""

Piccolomini-reproached Sigismondo Malatesta for transforming San Francesco into a temple of the Gentiles "ut non tam Christianorum quam infidelium daemones adorantium templum esse videretur." 111 Finally, in the last years of the century, Savonarola let loose his formidable wrath. But all this was in vain. The Cinquecento saw the sway of mythology irresistibly established both in art and literature. At the same time, however, the indignation and the threats of the censors explain the precautions taken by contemporary mythographe;s, as by their predecessors, in approaching the subject, and their care to defend themselves from the charge of giving offense to the "true religion." It might have been expected that the Counter Reformation would institute a far more systematic and profound opposition, and that after the Council of Trent a period of austerity would open for the arts, the first victims of which would be the gods. It is true that at this time we see the idols being expelled from the Vatican by Pius V, and hurled by Sixtos V from the summit of the Campidoglio. Sixtus also ordered a sculptured Moses instead of a Neptune for the Fontana dell'Acqua Felice. Preachers thundered at will against paganism, and in the same period artists like Ammanati "" publicly repented

But in spite of symptoms like these, it is clearly apparent that the gods were not too much injured by such accesses of virtue, and that mythology

continued with renewed ardor to people galleries and palaces with nude figures, acknowledged and encouraged by the Church herself in the persons 0£ her prelates. Their lack· of instruction, and also 0£ creative £orce, as we have said, made the artists dependent upon men of letters, whose meticulous instructions they received with docility, and often with gratitude. Who were these learned advisers? None other than Churchmen--the theologians and their intimates, Panvinio, Caro, Cardinal Sirleto himsel£."" Vincenzo Borghini, prior of the Innocenti in Florence, is indispensable as organizer of the mascherate of the gods--the lielpful adviser whom Vasari cannot do without.20 According to tradition, it was Monsiguor Agucchi who furnished the Carracci with the theme for their famous Gallery.... The influence 0£ these learned ecclesiastics ought, without doubt, to have led artists away from profane subjects 0£ this order, inspiring them with a more Christian spirit; but it had exactly the opposite effect, and at the end, as at the beginning of the century, the most important pagan decorations were executed for cardinals. Of this, the Farnese palaces at Rome and Caprarola offer convincing proof.'" Thus the great ecclesiastics encouraged not only by their counsel, but by actual commissions, the abuses which it would rather have been their duty to check. The situation is paradoxical only in appearance, and it would be an error to attribute this laxity solely to the epicureanism, l\ant 0£ conscience, and impiety of the clergy. In reality, the same conflict had existed since the first centuries 0£ Christianity; it was part and parcel of the very culture of men of the Church.

demn, as theologians. One need but recall, in this connection, St. Augustine or St. Jerome and their inner conflicts. Their minds are haunted by the profane poetry which they ought to denounce; OT it has penetrated their very souls. In the twelfth century, a Guibert of Nogent, a Pierre of Blois, secretly cherish the ancients whom they deny in public. Hildebert of Lavardin reminds the faithful that they are children of Christ, not of Minerva or Venus,.. but celebrates in Latin verses the statues of the gods and their supernatural beauty."' Pope Pius II, who reproached Sigismondo Malatesta for having "paganized" a Christian sanctuary,30 is the same Aeneas Sylvius, archeologist and man of letters, whose elegant prose is adorned with mythological allusions, and who upon occasion defends Ovid's Metamorphoses.31 It is true that, for the most part, the pagan current prevails with these Roman prelates of the sixteenth century at the expense of morality and faith; but when they delight in composing a Ciceronian parallel between Diana and the Virgin Mary, and even when they take pleasure in watching bacchanalia,82 they are, in the last analysis, merely being true to their education. The indulgence shown by official--or officious--censors after the Council of Trent is to be explained in the same way; for the most part they went no further than to denounce as unseemly the use of this mythology which was, however, the most manifest symptom of the return to pagan ideas. Possibly they also thought it the most inoffensive:•

One chapter of the discourse .. that he devoted to sacred and profane images is entitled: Delle pitture di Giove, di Apolline, Mercurio, Giunone,
Cerere, et altrifalsi Dei. It contains some most significant admonitions ( Bk. II, chap. x), pointing out (p. 122, v.) that the abuse which consists in keeping alive the memory of the gods is all the more dangerous and blameworthy in that, under the pretext of the study of literature or antiquity, it often infects men of the greatest distinction. He anticipates the objection that the images of the gods are the scholars' instruments, indispensable for their knowledge of antiquity or for some other laudable end, since all of them read the pagan works and the fables of the poets, which are filled with allusions to the gods. To this, Paleotto answers that his criticism is aimed above all at the custom of keeping images of the gods where they may easily he seen, and of using them as household ornaments. If a man's mind he set upon having such images in his house, solely for purposes of study, let him at least have the discretion to keep them out of sight. This precaution ought to he observed by Churchmen above all (p. 124, r., v.). Thus, mythology is dangerous; images of the gods are "filthy and criminal," and are admissible only under the express reservation that they he kept out of sight, where they cannot exert harmful influence on the public. This kind of severity did not act as a check upon artists, but it did not fail to trouble them-all the more, since Paleotto went further than this and condemned even grotteschi "in the name of reason" (Bk.II, Chaps. XXVII-XLII) • He thus includes in his attack against mythology its most innocent derivatives, and would deprive artists even of motifs of pure decoration. It is to he regretted that Paleotto published no more than a summary of his last three hooks. ~ook III was to have been entirely directed against "lascivious paintings"-in other words, especially against the world of Fable, natural habitat of nudes and of sensual images. Chapter headings, such as those for Chap. XI ("That statues and images of men and women have apeculiar power to move the senses"), Chap. XXII ("Arguments used by painters

to justify representation of nude and lascivious figures, or unseemly attitudes"), and Chaps. XXIII and DUY ("Reply to painters' contrary views"; "Further replies showing that painters can on no grounds he excused for representing indecent or lascivious subjects"), are a sufficient indication that mythology itself was to have been the author's target. They show also that artists were disturbed by the attack. Feeling themselves threatened, they had constructed a system in their own defense which it would have been of interest to know and analyze. Fortunately, in the next century, Pietro da Cortona and the Jesuit Ottonelli took the trouble to define the main points of the controversy. Taking their inspiration from the ideas of Paleotto and of the Padre Possevino,'" they devoted an important chapter of their Treatise on Painting and Sculpture 88 to the images of the gods: "del giuditio che si puo fare dell'immagini de'falsi dei de'gentili." The objections made by the artists are set forth and refuted one by one, and it is here that the best picture of their attitude is obtained (pp. 82-88). It goes without saying that the artists do not allow themselves to he convinced by the solemn proclamation of some of their opponents that "Christus Dominus in mundum venit, et sanguinem profudit, ut omnem Deorum memoriam exstingueret." 87 Painting and sculpture, they reply, do not perpetuate the worship of the gods; no risk is involved in preserving their memory, now that superstition has disappeared from the world. Besides, they hasten to add, artists have no choice: great gentlemen and princes frequently order mythological figures as decoration for their palaces, and their wishes must he followed. Furthermore, in the case of a vast decorative cycle, mythology alone gives the painter sufficient scope for the erudition and variety which are expected of him. These are the decisive arguments; we shall soon see that they have overcome the scruples of the most devout artists. The censors can produce

only feeble contentions in reply: "The prince might always he urged to alter the terms of his commission," and as for erudition and variety, "these are obviously indispensable qualities, hut the artist can show that he is ingenious and cultivated without resorting to the images of false gods!" As a reply to those who persist in their strictures, the artists have in reserve a final argument-the most specious, perhaps, hut for us the most interesting of all. The :figures of the gods, symbolically interpreted, can teach and inspire love of good and hatred of evil. And this time there is no manner of use in pointing out to them that a good painter can represent the vices and virtues in some other way, or in asking how many persons are capable of understanding the moral significance of the myths. This new excuse is too convenient, and above all too well adapted to the spirit of the time, to he willingly renounced. But the artist cannot invoke it in good faith without giving his subject a more or less edifying tum; a more or less important role in his composition must he reserved for allegory. It is here that we grasp the indirect influence of the Church on the forms of "pagan" art.
*
FIRST OF ALL, let us see how this return to allegory, considered as a moral antidote to mythology, manifests itself in the second half of the sixteenth century. In 1554 appeared Dolce's Trasformationi.38 The dedication to the counselor of Charles V, Monsignor Perrenot, bishop of Arras (later Cardinal de Granvelle}, is enveloped in precautions: "What could be less appropriate for dedication to Caesar, upon whose shoulders the infinite providence of God has placed the responsibility of upholding the Christian religion, than fables, and recitals of love? My decision to do so will be regarded by many as unwise, perhaps even as extremely unwise." But the excuse is at hand: "Nevertheless, those who will take the trouble to look with discernment not at the surface of the fables contained in this book, but at the motives which brought about their invention and the ends

270 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
to which they were directed by those early Masters, will see beneath the rind of fiction, all the sap of moral and sacred Philosophy." And in order to make his position still more explicit, Dolce introduced into all the editions after 1568 an "allegoria" at the end of each canto, in which its pious meaning is unmistakably set forth.

Canon Comanini follows the same line of reasoning, maintaining that no man of sense should choose as his subjects inept and hollow fables, un· worthy of the name, since they serve no purpose whatever and have nothing to teach. He may, however, represent the others at will-tales which embody meaning and exp1·ess some truth.'" This distinction, of course, leaves the artist completely free, for into what fable or figure is it not possible to read some edifying interpretation?

THEORIES REGARDING THE USE OF MYTHOLOGY 271
The Middle Ages have offered us copious demonstration of the fact that in this domain the ingenuity of "men of virtue" knows no limits. And in this respect the Renaissance yields nothing to the earlier period.40 But from the day the Council of Trent uttered its warnings, allegory became more than ever a means of avoiding censure--a sort of expedient for vindicating pagan imagery and licentious tales.41 There are different ways of making use of this antidote. Sometimes it is administered after the fact. We may be permitted to borrow here a celebrated example from the seventeenth century, the Daphne of Bernini, and the words engraved on its pedestal:
Quisquis amans sequitur fugitivae gaudia formae Fronde manus implet, baccas seu carpit aTTW.ras
These lines are by Cardinal Barberini (later Urban VIII), who improvised them in order to counteract the disturbing charms of the nymph, and to allay the scruples of Cardinal de Sourdis... What Urban VIII achieved with an epigram, the Carracci had attempted in the Farnese Gallery-perhaps more seriously-by means of small em• hlems discreetly placed in the corners of the hall. These four "dottissimi immagini," we learn from Malvasia (after Bellori),.. are the basis of the whole work: they represent phases in the combat between sacred and profane love, symbolized by the two Eros figures struggling for a palm branch (fig. 100). These putti, who pass at first quite unnoticed by the spectator, should serve upon closer examination to inform him that all the mythological figures which decorate the Gallery are in reality so many allusions "to the punishments of vice and the reward of virtue." ..

272 THE Sl:RVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
Often indeed, it is to the gods themselves that the artist, with more or less conviction, entrusts the task of incarnating ideas or moral principles. Vasari says as much. somewhat pretentiously, v.ith regard to his frescoes in the Palazzo Yecchio in Florence: ""E se in questa sala ed in altre vo dichiarando queste mie invenzioni sotto nome di favolosi dei, siami lecito in questo imitax gli antichi, i quali sotto questi nomi nascondevano allegoricamente i concetti della filosofia." •• At one stroke, the artist's mythology becomes "philosophical" and is no longer subject to censure. Even those who, like Jacopo Zucchi, refuse to recognize the ''sapientia ,eterum" beneath the outv.ard shell of Fable, cannot resist invoking the tradi~ tional allegories: "Just as the eye-spangled
101. Eros and .4nteros
peacock"s tail and the rainbow"-attrihutes of Juno--"dissolve into nothing, so do ambition and wealth." 41 Thus the admonitions of the Church did not 1emain \\holly ineffective. Without turning painters away from pagan subjects (or even trying to do so), they gave decisive encouragement to the taste for allegory.

THE SPIRIT of the time, indeed, v.as already leading artists in the same direction; e\'erything predisposed them to see painting as essentially a means of ''rendering thought visible."

"Quod legentibus scriptura, hoc idiotis praestat pictura" ••-an argument which was to be used to the point of satiety, for a long time to come. "The principal reason," wrote the Abbe Pluche in 1748, "for the painters' continued use of fables and allegory is that intellectual subjects are not susceptible of direct visual presentation and, in order to be apprehended by the senses, must be given bodily form and habiliment." 50 This is the cause, furthermore, of the extraordinary popularity of syro• belie figures at the end of the sixteenth century.51 We have already sketched the history of this movement, seeking its immediate origins in Quattrocento Neoplatonism, and in the supposed disclosure of the enigmatic meaning of the hieroglyphs." The growing vogue of emblems witnesses the extent of the movement and gives us a true picture of the role played by the Church in its propagation. In fact, this pseudo science, which teaches us to hide, or to discover, the most serious precepts beneath the most frivolous outward appearances, offered a providential means of reconciling the pagan and Christian worlds, the profane and the sacred, at the very moment when a rupture between them seemed imminent. Fables, for example, could be "sanctified" merely by the attribution of a spiritual meaning. This play of concealed meanings authorizes all sorts of combinations and transpositions. "Christian" emblems 53 utilize elements of pagan iconography to illustrate the teachings of the faith: Cupid, wearing a halo as disguise, becomes the Infant Jesus, and Ovid is

made to yield devout imagery. Pere Menestrier expressly sanctions this sort of thing when he says that figures from profane history, and even from Fable, may be used as sacred emblems: "Les figures de l'histoire prophane et de la fable meme peuvent servir afaire des emhlemes sacrez." .. These ,strange products of Catholic humanism have been studied by Mario Praz •• and the Abbe Bremond."" They offer abundant proof that it was both legitimate and easy to juggle with mythology in a symbolic sense, in order to make it reveal the truths of Scripture. The Roman Church inviting the Protestants to return to her bosom could even be represented as the nymph Salmacis calling Hermaphroditos! ••
*
ONE CAN view these absurd analogues as the result of a harmless obsession, and smile upon them indulgently."" Without doubt, many sincere believers who were at the same time ardent students of literature associated their profane erudition and their faith naively and with no mental reservation. For them allegory was merely a flower-strewn path leading from one to the other. But it must he admitted that, basically, allegory is often sheer impos• ture, used to reconcile the irreconcilable--just as we have seen it lending decency to the manifestly indecent."" On both grounds, it is a dangerous fraud. The Church had seen this danger. In the Trideritine Index, in which the works of Ovid are not even mentioned, the moralized versions are expressly

prohibited: "In Ovidii metamorphoseos libros commentaria sive enarrationes allegoricae vel tropologicae." 80 The meaning of this proscription is clear: the ecclesiastical censors do not intend to allow erotic stories to be published under a pious disguise,81 nor the sacraments of the Gospels to be hidden within the amours of the gods.13 Thus, in principle, the Church condemned the use of allegory, but she encouraged it in fact. The crisis of the Counter Reformation had clearly shown the discord between the pagan spirit and Christian morals; for that very reason the need of reconciliation and justification which had never ceased secretly to torment the literati and artists of the Renaissance became more urgent than ever. The same uneasiness and false modesty which gave birth to hypocritical or petty concessions, such as the vine leaves or breeches applied by Daniel da Volterra to Michelangelo's nudes, found in allegory the ideal expedient-a concealing veil and an honorable formula of compromise. The educational program elaborated by the Jesuits 63 shows what good use can be made of so convenient and supple an instrument as allegory had become. This program, as is well known, resolutely integrated pagan letters into the scheme of Christian instruction-and this at a time when logic, prudence, and good faith would seem rather to have dictated their banishment. In circumstances not unlike those in which the Fathers of the fourth century had found themselves ..-face to face, that is, with a culture which they knew to be contrary to their own faith, but which enjoyed immense traditional prestige and had played a part in their own development 05-the Jesuits adopted a similar attitude and accepted what they knew they were powerless to uproot or replace. The Church once more accepted the pagan heritage, and proceeded to transmit it.

276 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
Mythology, in consequence, occupied a place of honor in the Jesuit colleges; 08 furthermore, the two treatises on mythology which came to be regarded as authoritative in seventeenth-century France were the work of Jesuit authors, the Peres P. Gaultruche and F. A. Pomey."' The gods, officially consecrated as elements of rhetoric that it would be a disgrace not to know ("in quorum ignoratione versari non potest, sine summo dedecore, qui liberalium disciplinarum peritos audire vult"), again became the indispensable ornaments of formal discourse, as they had been in the time of Ausonius or Claudian.08 But it is not on literary grounds alone that the teaching of Fable is justified. It is exalted for its edifying value as well; it, too, aims at "the greater glory of God." 08 Mythology, in fact, say the Fathers, is not a jumble of absurd or shocking tales ("Non sunt hae fabulae anilia commenta aut insulsae narrationes somniorum"), it is a body of moral precepts, cunningly hidden under the mask of fiction "as the stone is hidden in the fruit." In this light, there is in mythology nothing to alarm the most delicate conscience: "Nee te fabulae nomen deterreat. . • ." And to inculcate in their pupils this special form of casuistry, which excuses pleasure on the grounds of profit and concedes that sin may be purified by good intention, the Jesuits teach them the science of emblems '0 along with their mythology, the first being the method constantly to be applied to the second. Are not all the fables of the ancients emblems, and all the attributes

of the gods hieroglyphs? 71 And does not the art of emblems consist precisely in imparting moral instruction through figures drawn from Fable? 02 In fact, as Mario Praz has observed,73 emblems were marvelously adapted to the pedagogical principles of the Jesuits. They seem to have been made for the express purpose of imprinting truth on the mind by way of the senses ("for there is nothing," says Richeome in his Peinture spirituelle, "which gives more delight and more easily permits outside things to slip into the soul than does painting; nothing which so deeply engraves them in the memory"), for reconciling the useful and pleasurable/• and for combining diversion with instruction. As La Fontaine was to point out:

These didactic advantages were to make of painting one of the favorite instruments of Jesuit propaganda. But there is a pleasing detail to pro,e that while serving the Jesuit cause, emblems were also serving the cause of mythology: the Company represented itself in the guise of Mercury coming down from heaven as the messenger charged with orders from the gods!'"
*
LET us now look back at the manuals oi Giraldi, Conti, and Cartari. They offer a material ready prepared for transmutations and exegeses of this kind. Their origins and nature were such as to disarm the scruples of some and serve the pious ends of others; their gods, heirs of the Middle Ages, were once more easily adapted to the mould of allegory from which they had never fully emerged. The oddity of their forms, the multiplicity of their attributes, the Oriental elements which endowed them with mystery-to say nothing of the "Neoplatonic" significance with which they were already shrouded-allowed them to be moralized and spiritualized at will. The mythologies designed for use in the colleges were therefore to draw

largely upon these earlier works; 11 but as early as the end of the Cinquecento they, too, had been absorbed into the monumental lconologia of Cesare Ripa,Ts which Emile Male saw as "the key to the painted and sculptured allegories of the seventeenth century."'" Ripa not only used for the most part the same sources as Giraldi, Conti, and Cartari-that is to say, the medieval mythographers, hieroglyphs, and numismatics-hut he borrowed from them the very images which he converted into abstractions.80 In his bible of symbols, the figures of the gods lose all value of their own, all independent existence; "made," in his own expression," to signify something other than meets the eye," they are no more than "veils or garments intended to conceal that part of philosophy which has to do with the generation and corruption of natural things, the disposition of the Heavens, etc. • • • and with what is within man himself: his concepts and habits. • • ." 11 In other words, mythology proclaims philosophical truths and moral concepts.

III
The Influence of the Manuals
W
E HA v E just reviewed the circumstances which in the last half of the sixteenth century appeared favorable to the diffusion of mythology in literature and art, and hence to the success of the manuals. Even the factor which at first glance would seem most likely to have weighed in the opposite direction, the offensive of the Council of Trent against profane images, :finally operated in their favor. The manuals, in fact, attained an outstanding success; the number of editions justifies the conclusion that during more than a century, in Italy and in the rest of Europe, they had their place in the library of every artist and man of letters. Thus, editions of Conti's Mythology succeeded one another at very short intervals: it appeared three times in Venice, in 1551, 1568, and 1581; four times in Frankfort, in 1581, 1584, 1585, and 1596; three times in Paris, in 1583, 1588, and 1605 (issued that year by three different publishers simultaneously). Furthermore, it was published in Geneva, 1596; in Lyons, 1602; in Hanau, 1605; in Padua, 1616. The French translation, by J. de Montlyard, was printed five times: Paris, 1599; Lyons, 1604, 1607; Rouen, 1611; and again in Paris, 1627. Cartari's Images of the Gods went through twelve Italian editions: Venice, 1556, 1566, 1571, 1580; Lyons, 1581; Padua, 1603, 1608, 1615; Venice, 1624; Padua, 1626; Venice, 1647, 1674. Five Latin editions appeared: Lyons, 1581; Rothenburg, 1683; Mainz, 1687; Frankfort, 1687; Mainz, 1699. Five were in French: Lyons, 1581; Toumon, 1606; Lyons, 1610, 1624, 1631.

1599), also a German one, entitled Neu erofjneter Gotzen Tempel (Frankfort, 1692). However, when we attempt to specify the precise role and influence of the manuals it is difficult to find evidence. The hooks that everyone consults and keeps constantly at his elbow are never, or hardly ever, mentioned; hy reason of their very popularity, they soon become anonymous handbooks; 1 no one quotes a dictionary. Furthermore, a writer or artist who wishes to display his erudition is not particularly eager to reveal the source of the learning that he has acquired with so little expenditure of time or energy: those who owe the most to Giraldi, Cartari, and Conti are usually careful not to acknowl' edge their indebtedness. It is, however, possible to recover traces of these borrowings; we shall look £or them first in Italian art, and then in European humanism.
*
WE DISCOVER such traces first of all in the festivals, processions, and "triumphs"-in other words, in that middle sphere between art and life in which
Renaissance Italy produced so many
102. Apollo, Hadad, and Atargatis ephemeral masterpieces.2
In spectacles of this type, mythology normally played an important, if not the essential role. But toward the end of the Cinquecento, this mythology took on a curiously hybrid character. We take as examples some of the fetes celebrated in Florence between 1565 and 1589: the "Masque of the Genealogy of the Gods," staged for the marriage of Francesco de'Medici to Johanna of Austria (1565), and the apparati arranged for two other weddings--those

Thus, on the :first carriage in the Mascherata, we see an old man in his cavern-the famous Demogorgon of Boccaccio;• again, a woman dressed in black and white, bearing thunderbolt and tympanon in her hands, is the Juno of Martianus Capella. Further along in the procession appears a strange Venus, with a burning torch on her breast, and in her left hand three apples of gold. We recognize in her the Venus of the Saxon Chronicle and the Mer des kystoires." Even more surprising is the Apollo mounted on the chariot of the Sun, bearded and wearing a cuirass, a basket on his head and a flower in his hand, preceded by two eagles, three women, a serpent, etc. This :figure we also know: he is not in any sense the god of Olympus, but the Assyrian Apollo described by Macrobius in the Saturnalia." We have already met all these :figures, and scores of others, in Giraldi and Cartari (figs. 102 and 103). The same thing is true of the intermedi composed in 1585 and 1589 in honor of the two princely couples. At the marriage of Cesare d'Este and Vir• ginia de' Medici, Jupiter appears with a trident, shod in green, and seated on a cushion of peacock's feathers; 7 for the wedding of Ferdinando de' Medici and Christine of Lorraine, Saturn, Apollo, and Bacchus once more wear the costumes which they displayed at the marriage of Mercury and Philology.• However unusual they may seem, none of these figures succeeds in baffling us, any more than do Diana's serpents or Juno's poppies," or the curious at

tributes of Pan, Sosipolis, Mars, Hymenaeus, or Necessity. On the contrary, such images make clear to us at a glance the source from which the organizer of these fetes, Giovanni Bardi, has drawn his material. So numerous and striking are the parallel details, in fact, that there can be no possible doubt of the extent to which the manuals served him as guide -as they served Monsignor Vincenzo Borghini, organizer of the Mascherata. In most cases it is enough merely to compare the illustrations in Cartari with the drawings of the stage designers: th11S, in the apparato of 1589 we have a Mercury and an Aesculapius "like those," de' Rossi assures us, "shown us by

*
IF WE admit, with Lasca,u that the chief merit of a festival procession in• tended for the amusement of the crowd is to be intelligible to everyone, we may well have our doubts as to whether these mythological entertainments satisfied that condition. However cultivated the Florentine public may have been, it must have found itself slightly nonplussed by the baroque pantheon thus made to file before its eyes. This is, indeed, one of the reasons why ex• planatory accounts were published after the fact." The organizers, annoyed at finding the depth of their knowledge and the subtlety of their intentions misunderstood, attempt to justify themselves by setting forth in detail the secret beauties that the crowd has shown itself unable to appreciate. Another producer of mythological pageants, Raffaello Gualterotti,10 complains that his :figures and devices have been thought displeasing by reason of their obscurity ("spiacevoli per oscurita"). He has, however, composed them for a cultivated public; so great an expense of care and thought would not have been justified had the popular audience alone been concerned. Indeed, it often happens--so he says-that he who sets out to please the ignorant ends by making himself appear ignorant in the eyes of those whose approval ought by

rights to he sought first of all. Here we catch a glimpse of the pedantry of the time, and also of the dilemma in which the authors of argomenti found themselves, caught between the demands of the public and those of the more cultivated audience. The artist was faced with the same dilemma. If too obvious, his subject matter risked the scorn of the connoisseur; if too complicated, the indifference of the larger public. We see a problem of this sort in a letter written by Bronzino to Vincenzo Borghini on July 25, 1578,10 commenting on the choice of the life of Hercules as theme for a set of tapestry designs. The subject, he concedes, may he too well known; but he has noted that people sometimes take more pleasure in what is familiar to them than in something which they find it difficult to understand. To he clear without being trivial, profound without being obscure 17this would have been the ideal formula. But with the new tendencies of taste, it became more and more difficult to apply. And as it was the "learned" who must :6.rst of all be satisfied, we shall soon see the painters themselves, like our "inventors" of pageants, explaining their works by means of long notices which at times have the air of being written in order to justify them in the eyes of the larger public. For the rest, it was by taking part in the planning of festivals that artists learned to complicate a theme to the point of unintelligibility. Throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the work of decorators and producers was entrusted not to obscure artisans, hut to painters and sculptors of renown. In the fetes of 1565, for example, the collaborators included Ammanati, Bronzino, Giovanni da Bologna, Vasari, Zucchi, and Federigo Zuccaro; 11 some of the work which they produced for the occasion deserved to last longer than a single day.11 But the artists, it should be emphasized, were here serving

merely as willing tools. Nothing was left to their imagination or initiative. The regisseur general of the spectacle, Vincenzo Borghini, not content with merely assigning the tasks, overwhelmed his collaborators with exact instructions which he expected them to follow literally."" In so doing, he doubtless fed their own imagination, but he also irritated and sometimes greatly embarrassed them. In fact, not only were they being subjected to the tyranny of a text, but the text itself was sometimes strangely stubborn and unpromising. The :figures that it imposed were such as to defy all possibility of plastic expression or harmonious composition. As we have already observed,:n all the mongrel or barbaric divinities which in these texts, as in the manuals, supplant the classical gods, are rich in mysterious attributes, but poor in grace and majesty. How could artists breathe life into these buffoons and monsters, these pedantic fictions and Oriental charades? The illustrators of the Mascherata, in their praiseworthy efforts at stylization, occasionally found a happy compromise."" But how were they to represent Thetis, with a tree on her head, and four feet (two lion paws and two bird claws), or Vitumnus, whose figure was composed of an eye, three human heads, a hawk, a fish, and a hippopotamus? ., Such oddities may pass muster in spectacles of this type-processions, masques, ballets, where the designer need not fear an excess of variety or overloading; a multiplicity of :figures, motley brilliance in the total effect, and profusion and extravagance of detail are even desirable in this domain.24 But taste and restraint would seem to exclude them from among veritable works of art.

AND NEVERTHELESS these gods of carnival find their way into art as wellfirst of all, into the monumental frescoes which, from the middle of the six• teenth century on, people the palaces of Rome, Florence, and Venice with a world of strange and hitherto unknown creatures. Examples are the Sala Regia and the Cappella Paolina in the Vatican, the Florentine Palazzo Vecchio, the Doge's Palace in Venice, and the Farnese Palace at Caprarola. These vast decorative ensembles are typical products of the culture of the time. Their aim is less to give pleasure (delectare) than to teach ( prodesse) ."" Each one of them develops a program elaborated at length by a humanist; this program has as center and primary aim the glorification of an individual, a family, a city, or an institution-but it is supported by a scaffolding of philosophical or religious ideas. Thus the decoration of the palace at Caprarola naturally revolves around two members of the Farnese family, Cardinal Alexander Farnese and Pope Paul III; but it is entirely based on the double theme of the Active and the Contemplative Life, which determines the total disposition-the first being illustrated in the summer and the second in the winter apartment. Each room belonging to the two suites illustrates some one aspect of ..action" or "contemplation." For example, in the winter apartment, the Sala del Mappamondo invites us to consider Earth and Heaven, the splendor of Creation itself; the Sala dei Angeli and the Sala dei Sonni call to mind the celestial apparitions with which man is sometimes favored in wakeful hours or in dream~; lastly, the Sala dei Giudizi and the Sala della Penitenza invite solitary meditation upon Divine Justice."" Seen as a whole, the halls of the palace thus form a cycle, an unbroken system of thought. Without doubt, nothing of all this is entirely new. We have already met with examples of such figurative encyclopedias, even in profane art, in the late medieval centuries. We have also seen how the Renaissance took up these didactic programs again, either retaining their theological disposition, or concentrating their emphasis on the mortal glory of some pontiff or condottiere."

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANUALS 287
But the decorations of the Palazzo Trinci, the Tempio Malatestiano, the Borgia Apartments, or the Stanza della Segnatura differ profoundly from those which concern us at present. The first group, as we have shown, were Summae--more or less debased or fragmentary, hut for all that syntheses still essentially scholastic in character, bringing together the traditional elements (stars, sciences, virtues, Biblical and pagan heroes), and translating into visual form man's relationship with the world and the harmonies within nature, morality, and history. Now, on the other hand, we have to do in each case with one particular system, hatched by the ingenious brain of a humanist, who has mustered all his erudition to build an artificial edifice out of disparate elements--scenes, episodes, motifs chosen fiom the immense reservoir of pagan or Christian antiquity for this express purpose and by reason of their very singularity. In the earlier ensembles, established data and accepted relations appeared beneath a familiar iconography; now, unfamiliar and apparently disconnected images mask a train of ideas which we fail to grasp. Each time we are faced with a new riddle. Mythology still plays a considerable role (even more so than in the past), but it is fatally submerged in allegory. The humanists, who are the sovereign dictators of themes, draw their material from Fable as readily as from history or Scripture--often, indeed, being led in that direction by personal predilection; 08 but there is no doubt, also, that Fable, as they understand it, lends itself admirably to their purpose. This purpose is to translate a series of concepts into a succession of images; now, as we fully understand, the images of the gods are "emblems" replete with meaning..,. They thus have an incomparable utility. It therefore results that the humanist, less concerned with the plastic qualities of an image than with its symbolic possibilities, turns by preference to the most complex, overcharged, and bizarre mythological figures, believing them best fitted to exhibit all the nuances of his thought and the subtlety of his intentions. Another consequence is the strictness with which he insists upon the literal execution of his program by the artists whom he is called upon to direct. He is not content merely to provide a theme, or to trace the canvas in
28 See supra, p. 265. 28 See supra, p. 276.



288 THE SURVIJ'AL OF THE PAGAN GODS
its general lines; he enters into every detail-the position of a hand, the color of a fabric. And in truth such details are not a matter of indifference, since each is a sign, invested with meaning. Omission or modification might not affect the beauty of the image, but would threaten something of far greater importance-its truth to the thought which it is to embody.
*
Now IT IS precisely here, in the singular choice of figures for representation and in their detail, that the influence of the contemporary mythographers is apparent. We shall draw our examples from three famous cycles: Vasari's mythological decorations in the Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence; those of Taddeo Zuccaro in the Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola; and those of Jacopo Zucchi in the Palazzo Ruspoli, in Rome. For the analysis and interpretation of these three decorative ensembles, we are fortunate in possessing explanatory texts of great value. Vasari, indeed, has left us marginal comments on his own work in the Ragionamenti; Zucchi deals with his in his Discorso; for Zuccaro, we have the extremely detailed instructions which he received from Annibale Caro.3° The Ragionamenti of Vasari was composed after the completion of his frescoes in the Palazzo Vecchio, in 1558, and published only after his death. In an imaginary conversation with Francesco de' Medici, he explains to the prince all the mythological representations and allegories with which he has covered the palace walls. In reality, his aim is certainly to make known to the wider public the meaning of a work which he himself knows to be unintelligible, especially since it is still further complicated by all sorts of allusions to the Medici family. But Vasari himself is not the author of the commentaries which, with a somewhat naive complacency, he showers upon his fictitious interlocutor. He

utilizes (though of course without acknowledgment) the letters of 1555 and 1556 in which Cosimo Bartoli provided him with the whole program for the Sala degli Elementi, and the rooms of Lorenzo, of Cosimo, and of Leo X.81 And has he not made use of other documents as well? It is at all events curious to compare the description of Ops by Vasari himself 32 with that found in Cartari's /magini. Not only are the attributes assigned to the goddess identical in the two texts; the explanations of these attributes are also alike, as will be seen in the accompanying comparative tabulation.

For the moment, no final conclusions as to the influence of the lmagini can be drawn from this parallel, since the painting of the Camera di Opi was begun before the first publication of the book; it cannot be denied, however, that even if we did not have the Ragionamenti, Cartari's text would apply perfectly to the Palazzo Vecchio goddess, and would account for her slightest attribute... Bartoli's choice of an Eastern divinity to personify the Earth should also be noted: under the name of Ops he describes, not the Roman goddess of the harvest, hut Cybele with her Phrygian train. At Caprarola, however, we shall see figures even more frankly exotic.

On November 11, 1562,"' Annibale Caro addresses a long epistle to Taddeo Zuccaro, setting forth for the painter's benefit the terms in which he himself has conceived the decoration of the bedchamber "ordered" by the Farnese cardinal. The plan leaves no room for discussion, and we shall see that Taddeo Zuccaro carried it out with complete docility. Now from Caro's first lines, so close an analogy with Cartari's Images of the Gods is displayed that a detailed comparison of texts is again warranted (see tabulation of parallels below).

296 THE SURVI'f/AL OF THE PAGAN GODS
This comparison is again conclusive. From the first, one is struck by the small number of "classical" figures proposed by Caro. Though his description of the House of Sleep {not, for that matter, easily translatable into painting) is taken from Ovid and Virgil, the details which he furnishes to the artist are for the most part bizarre and overwhelmingly complex. Zuccaro, however, seems to have accommodated himself to them well enough; at all events, he has rendered them with servile accuracy. True enough, whenever a possibility of choice is left open, he has managed to re• ject the more complex image in favor of the simpler one. He has preferred the Diana of Claudian to the Isis of Apuleius, freeing her forehead of the wings, horns, ears of wheat, mirror, serpents, and crown with which his over• learned author would have endowed her.30 But in a larger sense, the painter has not ventured to modify in any way the compositions proposed for the arches and lunettes of the hall, which are as enigmatic as could be desired: Harpocrates (the infant Horus, wrongly identified by the Greeks as the god of silence) is there carrying his fishing rod, Angerona wearing her gag, and Brizos standing under the elm with enchanted foliage. Even if Caro had not taken the trouble to give us his sources, we would have no difficulty in seeing that they are always those used by Cartari. The frequent textual identity of the descriptions proves that Caro made use of the lmagini in drawing up his instructions-just as Vasari was able to do in commenting on his own finished work. In the light of these observations, the role of the scholar as adviser of artists may seem to lose some of its importance and interest. Indeed, one of two things is true: either Caro had read Cartari, and acted merely as an intermediary between the hook and the artist; or (and this is improbable) Caro did not know the book, hut himself took the trouble of looking in earlier authors for the elements of his descriptions. But as his authors are the same ones quoted in the /magini-Pausanias, Apuleius, Macrobius, and Martianus Ca

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANUALS
pella-we are led to the same conclusion. Caro's intervention was not necessary. Had Taddeo Zuccaro held the lmagini in his hands, and known no more than the names of the personages whom he was to represent, the result would have been exactly the same paintings we see today in the Camera dell'Aurora. For any painter whose library contains such a reference work as this, the counsels of the humanists are superfluous. We need only look, for example, at the passage in Caro's letter dealing with Harpocrates and Angerona: "The figure of Harpocrates is
that of a youth, or rather a child 104. Harpocrates and Angerona

. . . holding his finger to his mouth. He holds a fishing rod in his hand." "Others have represented the same god a& a faceless figure, wearing a small hat on his head, wrapped in a wolfskin, and entirely covered with eyes and ears." "The figure of Angerona is that of a woman standing upon an altar, her mouth bound with a gag." It would have been simpler to say, "Represent Harpoc1ates and Angerona according to the /magini degli dei," where, indeed;" they appear fully described and ready for use (fig. 104). The painter needed nothing else; the expla11ato1 y text 1s a mere accessory, as Caro himself recognizes in a letter to Luca Martini where, after having briefly sketched the figures of certain gods-in particula1 that of Juno according to Martianus Capella-he concludes: " . . . I have given you a

summary description of the costumes, according to the written descriptions which I have found. To tell you the meaning of each would be a lengthy undertaking; for that matter, they are ordinarily known." sT Thus the letters of the scholars-busy men, overburdened with commissions, preparing tasks for other busy me:n--come to assume the terse, practical form of a reference list, toward which Cartari's Images also tends. One other set of instructions (of Cosimo Bartoli to Vasari) 88 presents an especially curious feature. The author is proposing a certain number of allegories for use in the Sala di Lorenzo in the Palazzo Vecchio, and in the margin opposite the mention of each, he enters a brief descriptive note. Examples are:
"Prudentia: donna con lalie e serpi alla conciatura della testa." "Buonevento: un povero in un mano la tazza, in l'altra spighe di grano." "La Fama: la sapete, fatta da voi mille volte." 39
The last words seem to betray Bartoli's impatience--his weariness at having, like a manual, continually to offer the same recipe. The letter dates from 1556, the year of the publication of the /magini. Cartari's work came as an answer to this very need, making it unnecessary for artists to turn elsewhere for information, or for scholars to furnish texts and repeat themselves indefinitely. There was, none the less, a continuation of demands from artists, and advice from scholars. But from this time on, the names of individual program makers become increasingly unimportant; we know in advance the sources from which they draw, and we hold the key to the most obscure rep• resentations. Whoever may have been their immediate provider, the "argu• ments" are a needless repetition of those which henceforth are to be found conveniently brought together and classified in the lmagini and the other mythological treati Further confirmation will be found in the Discorso of Zucchi and in his frescoes on the ceiling of the Palazzo Ruspoli. Like the Ragionamenti of his master Vasari, Zucchi's Discorso is a commentary intended to render his own

vantage. For if the analysis of the frescoes is a laborious task, at least we have no difficulty, thanks to the Discorso, in recognizing once more the mythographical traditions for which our manuals have served as a vehicle. The title gives us a first hint-Discorso sopra li dei de'gentili. This is the title of the medieval treatises-of the De diis gentium of Rabanus Maurus; Zucchi makes no secret, indeed, of the dependence of his composition on the Genealogia deorum of Boccaccio. The Oriental element is equally apparent. Zucchi knows the gods worshipped by the Libyans, Scythians, Persians, Egyptians, and Assyrians (p. 5); he knows both Jupiter "Heliopolites" and Jupiter Ammon (p. 18). When he describes Apollo, he does not forget to include among his attributes the hawk, the crocodile, and the scarabaeus (p. 25).
'° Like Vasar1's Ragoonamenll, the Discorso
did not appear till after the author's death, m
1602. The text, which is very rare, has been published, with a valuable introduction, by

After this, when he writes of Saturn (p. 15), ''There would still be much to say of this god, but two things restrain me: one is that I fear my own ig• norance; the other is the gi.eat number of scholarly books dealing with this material which have recently been published, where every detail will be found noted," we have every reason to think that he is alluding to Giraldi, Conti, or Cartari. Furthermore, there is an indubitable connection between Zucchi's frescoes and the engraved illustrations in Cartari. Each god painted by Zucchi is surrounded by an unbelievable number of attributes, many of them highly unusual. Diana, for example, holds not only her bow and arrows, but a key (recalling the functions of Lucina), while at her feet are seen three animal heads-dog, horse, and boar-recalling the Luna Triformis. 11 But the Discorso has a special interest for us. Obviously, Zucchi is satisfied neither with the subject matter of his paintings nor with his commentary on it. Mythology is displeasing to him; it would not be too much to say that it inspires him with horror. He rails unceasingly against "the vain and false religion of the Gentiles," their blind ignorance, their obstinacy, and the foulness and criminality of their gods.•• If he is sincere, one wonders why he has chosen a theme which so repels him. He attempts to give an explanation, though not without some confusion (p. 9). Troubled by the dimensions of his task, he had to tum to mythology as the only possible source for so elaborate a program." Furthermore, he felt himself constrained by tradition, for does not Armenini cite as the prime model for palace decoration the ceiling of the Palazzo del Te in Mantua, where there are "many gods, with Jove at the center"? So Zucchi resigned himself to reproducing the traditional forms, but he did so reluctantly. There was, however, one means of reconciling the demands of art and conscience-that is, to endow these shameful images with allegorical meaning. Zucchi is not unaware of this possibility, but he shows himself much more scrupulous with regard to it than do most of his contemporaries. He agrees that Fable contains the sap of truth beneath its rind, but he has no praise for those who would muffie this truth beneath a cloak of lies or hide it behind a

Ma non lodero mai, chi con il velame degl'adulterii, i latrocinii, stupri, e mille cose oscene, e brutte, e con la veste della bugia, vorra ornare, o coprire l'istessa verita della potenza e sapienza divina" (p. 8)." In spite of this declaration, and with manifest inconsistency, Zucchi cannot resist offering allegorical interpretations upon occasion, as of the attributes of Pan or Juno; '" but, in the last analysis, both his discomfort and his remorse are characteristic. He is among those who were most profoundly touched by the spirit of the Counter Reformation, and we have already seen the source of attitudes such as his in the writings inspired by the Council of Trent which deal with the essential character of art, its duties, and its aim.
*
THERE ARE few occasions other than in monumental painting on walls and ceilings for this learned mythology to display its weighty paraphernalia in complete freedom. Sculpture, as Armenini observes,.. is not fond of dealing with images of such complexity, and Michelangelo may after all be forgiven for not having adorned his statue of Night with a sheaf of poppies and a starstrewn mantle, since "these are things more appropriate to the painter than the sculptor."" Paintings in smaller dimensions seldom permit of such a lav• ish display of figures and attributes; a canvas cannot be overloaded like a carnival chariot. Certain allegories of Bronzino, however, meet this challenge successfully-among them the enigmatic Fortuna in the Uflizi, and the Time and Fally with Venus and Cupid in the National Gallery, London. And Federigo Zuccaro succeeds in massing in his Olympus a crowd of divinities, each weighed down by his burden of symbols in illustration of the motto "Cuique suum" (fig.107).

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANUALS 303
Rome and Florence appear to he the leading centers of this new iconography. Though it is true that the Venetians generally disliked bookish programs and overprecise schemes,.. even they show the erudite and expository tendencies of the art of this time. In the garlands of mythological nudes with which Veronese and his disciples, the Fasolos and the Zelottis,.. decorated the Palladian villas,00 one is inclined at :first to see nothing more than an irruption of fantasy; hut they, also, form cycles, "subjects in sequence, connected by one general idea." They are variations on an edifying theme, "inventioni morali," as Ridolfi defines them; 51 sometimes true psychomachies, combats of the soul. As for the mythological paintings in the Doge's Palace, where everything sings the glories of the "Most Serene Republic" and the wisdom of the senators, political maxims are there given visual translation. Thus, when Tintoretto in 1577 paints his famous series--Ariadne and Bacchus, Minerva and Mars, Vulcan's Forge, Mercury and the Three Graces-he wishes to express union, the true strength of the Republic. Ariadne, receiving the homage of a god near the sea, is Venice herself; Minerva repels Mars, just as the Senate keeps the horrors of war at a distance, thereby assuring abundance and prosperity. The Graces represent the rewards in store for the good citizen. Vulcan and his Cyclopes, alternately striking the forge, symbolize the joint effort of the senators to forge arms for the city, as guarantee of her power and glory. There is nothing exceptional in these subjects themselves, but careful observation will reveal many details which may at :first escape notice. Thus, one of the Graces holds a rose, another a myrtle branch, while the third is leaning on a die, of the sort used in games of chance.•• What is the explanation of thesf" attributes? The myrtle and rose, both dear to Venus, are symbols of enduring love. The die marks a reciprocity of benefits, since dice come and go. Finally,

304 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
if the Graces have Mercury as their companion, it is because they are to bestow themselves only in due measure, and as reason decrees (fig. 108). This is the explanation offered by a contemporary commentator; 53 it coincides, almost word £or word, with what is said by Cartari in describing and reproducing an identical image." The four bronze statues of Sansovino's Loggetta, to which we have already alluded,"' teach the same lesson as the canvases of Tintoretto. Pallas sets forth the wisdom and ability of the senators; Mercury, their knowledge and eloquence; Apollo, their truly unexampled harmony and accord. The figure of Peace, lastly, is "that peace so dear to the Republic," which assures her prosperity and hegemony. In short, these four divinities give expression to the principles and effects of sound government.56 But how does it happen that in Venice these uplifting intentions remain for the most part unsuspected? Elsewhere, our wonder and curiosity are constantly aroused; enigmas confront us wherever we turn. But here, nothing urges us to look deeper, so completely are mind and senses satisfied by the splendor of the forms. The mannerism of Florence and Rome, hollow and grudging in spite of its bombast, makes a virtue of obscurity. Its pedantry and its labored hieroglyphics are completely foreign to the splendid abundance of the Venetians, whose overflowing vitality makes them scorn the artificial fruit, lacking all aroma and taste, that ripens in libraries. Never, for their part, will the Venetians consent to sacrifice the "plastic" to the "intellectual," or to allow form to degenerate in the paralyzing embrace of the symbol. Hence the superb ease with which they free the gods from their entangling accessories. Like a certain character in Flaubert, the divinities of Vasari or Zucchi "disparaissent sous I'abondance de leurs attributs." The great robust bodies painted by Tintoretto and Veronese refuse to be stifled by such accretions. They extend their athletic limbs freely in space--richer in mean

306 THE SURVIVAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
It was the mission of the gods of Veronese and Tintoretto to celebrate the glory and prosperity of Venice, and they are not unworthy of that mission. The superb architecture of hacks and thighs, the mellow contours of satiny flesh, sing the pride of power and the delights of peace.09
*
IF ITALIAN ART, after 1550, is indebted to the mythological manuals, the same may be said of literature; but here we turn for our examples to France, England, Germany, and Spain. Again we shall be following the gods in their migrations. In France, as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, before Ronsard, Jean Le Maire de Belges becomes ''the popularizer of mythology in French letters." 60 The gods, in fact, play a prominent part in his Illustrations des Gaules et singularites de Troie.m To be sure, they most often appear decked out in unaccustomed fashion, but this is because Jean Lemaire's knowledge of Fable stems not from ancient sources, but from medieval or contemporary compilations: 62 the Mythologies of Fulgentius, the Etymologies of Isidore, the Supplementum chronicarum of Jacopo da Bergamo; above all, the Antiquitates of Annius of Viterbo, and the Genealogia deorum of Boccaccio, with Demogorgon and his progeny ""-a list of titles long fa. miliar to us. Jean Le Maire adopts not only the subject matter of these compilations but their spirit as well. Convinced that mythology is "rich in great mysteries and in poetic and philosophical meanings, containing fruitful substance beneath the artificial rind of Fable" (I, 4), he does his best to make it reveal at one moment historical allusion, at another some cosmic or moral meaning.
•• A further comparison may be made between
the pure allegone• of Veronese, person1fy1ng abstractions like Respect and Scorn, Constancy and lnfidebty (National Gallery), and allegories of the type used by Ripa. On the one hand we have noble forms, spontaneoualy living out the moral idea; on the other, the human figure treated as a mere scaffolding upon which to attach a whole panoply of attributes.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANUALS 307
Thus, after telling of the marriage of Thetis and Peleus, he undertakes, in his Chapter xxv, "the moral as well as the philosophical and historical explana• tion of the nuptials described above"; and when, in Chapter XXXI, he reports "the petitions and proposals made to Paris Alexander by the two mighty goddesses, Juno and Pallas," he does not fail to add to his account "the explanation in full of their clothing and adornments, their importance and power; from which things he who looks carefully may find much allegorical and moral fruit hidden under the colors of poetry." Allegory, for him, is even something more than a method of interpretation: it justifies lascivious scenes and sensual images by virtue of the weight of truth which they conceal... For the rest, his pseudo-classical divinities are intimately fused with the moral abstractions of the Roman de la Rose... Thus the work of Jean Le Maire is seen to be grafted to a mythological tradition with whose origins and ramifications we are well acquainted; it has, nevertheless, its own original savor and charm. The author's imagination, naive and precious at the same time, lends new grace to these debased immortals, recreating around them a poetic atmosphere which, if not that of Olympus, at least belongs to another enchanted kingdom, the realm of faerie.

NEXT we must ask whether the poets of the Pleiade looked, in their turn, to anthologies and manuals for elements of their vast erudition. Did they, at need, consult the new and invaluable repertories of information assembled by such men as Giraldi, Conti, and Cartari, who were almost their contempo• raries? As to Ronsard, the question is a complicated one; it has, indeed, given pause to two critics, Pierre de Nolhac and Paul Laumonier. Both express the opinion that the poet often gets his mythological information at second hand."" But who is his intermediary? Ronsard began to write before the publi

cation of the great Italian manuals; but he was a pupil of Dorat, who still made use of Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum, and of the 1535 collection already referred to 81 which included the treatises on fables by Hyginus and Fulgentius and v.as augmented in later editions by the Libellus of Albricus and extracts from Giraldi. From these various treatises, and from his impassioned and feverish reading of classical texts, Ronsard appears to have composed his own mythological refe1ence file."" On the other hand, when the Mythologia of Natale Conti appeared, Ron• sard in all probability knew the work, for its second edition was dedicated to Charles IX, and Ronsard was Charles' official poet. This dedication resulted in "naturalizing" the Mythologia in France, where, as we already know:• it was to have an outstanding vogue. We cannot, however, prove any specific borrowing by Ronsard from Conti, though K. Borinski claims to have detected a direct influence of the Mythologia in the Hymnes.'" But on the other hand, the work is cited in the famous commentary on the Amours by MarcAntoine Muret, and this is worthy of note. Muret's commentary, indeed, constitutes a sort of catalogue of what was known to the poets of the Pleiade; almost all the authors whom they read are mentioned in it!' After the death of Muret, from 1587 on, successive editors several times added to the glosses of the learned humanist, as if to sum them up: "Voyez la Mythologie franr;aise de Noel Le Comte. . . . Noel Le Comte decnt et e,q1ose excellement cette histoire. . . ." 70 It would seem, in other words, that they considered Conti's dictionary a wholly fitting-perhaps even sufficient-source of clarification for obscurities found in Ronsard. And, in fact, Ronsard'-s mythology and that of Conti have more than one

point in common. Ronsard, too, draws indiscriminately and simultaneously from all possible sources: 13 he welcomes all divinities-whether from Asia, Greece, Rome, or Egypt, whether primitive, classical, or decadent." He even turns by preference to the least known and most bizarre texts, as a display of erudition, showing himself in this more pedantic than du Bellay, who did not think that "Lycophron feust plus excellent qu'Homere, pour estre plus ohscur." 1" Lastly, faithful here to the teachings of Dorat, who had transmitted to him ''this troublesome medieval heritage," 16 Ronsard conceives of Fable as a "philosophia moralis." On his own account, he enjoys deifying abstractions and likes to "disguise the truth of things beneath a mantle of Fable." In this, again, he resembles the Italian mythographer. But with Ronsard, as needs hardly he said, through the intensity and :fire of study this bookish learning comes to life and is trans:figured.11 In the true sense of the word, the poet lives in a state of enthusiasm: he is haunted by these divinitie&, who from his earliest youth have accompanied his footsteps "au profond des vallees" and under the "omhrage incertain" of the forest. The confused, ill-digested mythology with which he has gorged himself does not stifle his imagination, hut rather intoxicates and exalts it, for within that mythology there vibrates for him the deep pulse of nature.

THE PIOUS du Bartas, Protestant though he was, and author of a poem on Biblical subjects, did not feel that he could deprive his Sepmaine 18 of the charms of mythology. He explains himself in his "Avertissement au lecteur" not without a certain embarrassment: "Others [i.e., other critics] would have me banish the words Flora, Amphitrite, Mars, Venus, Vulcan, Jupiter, Pluto, etc., from my hook. They are indeed to some extent right, hut I would have

them note that I have used the names sparingly. And when one does appear, it is by metonymy, or through some allusion to their fables: something which has always been practiced by authors of Christian poems! Poetry has for so long been in possession of these terms of fable that she can only rid herself of them little by little. • • ." As a matter of fact, the mythological allusions in the Sepmaine are so many and so learned that Simon Goulart, in his painstaking commentary on the poem (which, in this respect, recalls the commentary of Muret on Ronsard's Amours),"" seems to find it necessary to pause long over them in explanation. Now to what authors does Goulart tum? For Aeolus {p. 7) and Latona (p. 31) he consults "Noel des Contes, Venitien," and recommends the same source to the reader: "Whoever wishes an explanation of this poetic invention, together with most others, should read the Mythologie of Noel des Contes, the Venetian." Again, we find him invoking for Jupiter Ammon (p. 83) an authority who is equally familiar to us: "See fuller treatment in Gyraldus, in the sec• ond commentary of his Histoire des dieU!!&." Shortly afterward (on Phoebus, p. 99) he cites Conti and Giraldi together. Only Cartari is still lacking, but not for long. In explaining an allusion to Mars (p. 117), Goulart writes: "See Gyraldus, in the tenth hook of his Histoire des dieU!J&, Noel des Contes in his Mythologie, and Vincent Cartari in his Images des diewc."
Here, then, are our three Italian mythographers reunited, as we find them in several other passages of the same text.80 Goulart, it is evident, had the works constantly at his elbow; they provided him with the key to all his
difficulties.

IN FRANCE, as in Italy, the gods figured at this time in court entertainments, solemn entrees, and princely wedding celebrations. On occasions of this sort,

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANUALS 311
as one would expect, the influence of the Italian manuals also made itself felt. Thus, in the published text of the BaUet comique de la Royne, organized in 1582, the name of Natale Conti recurs.81 The fact is of particular interest since the poets of the Pleiade--Dorat, Bai£, Ronsard himself--collaborated in these fetes. Thus, for the triumphal entrance of Charles IX into Paris and the crowning of Elizabeth of Austria, on March 6 and 25, 1572, Ronsard composed sonnets which were inscribed on the bases of statues set up along the processional way, statues of Juno, the Dioscuri, and Hymenaeus.82
*
RABELAIS and Montaigne saw in mythology, as in history, little more than a collection of curiosities; but the examples and anecdotes which they drew from it were again taken for the most part either from the compilations of late antiquity or from the manuals of their own time. Thus Rabelais 83 finds details about Juno Moneta or Apollo Loxias in the Saturnalia of Macrobius; •• but he makes use also of the Officina of Textor,85 and the Dies geniales of Alexander of Naples.•• And though, as we have seen,8' he derides the abuses of allegorical mythology, Horapollo engages his interest in the hidden significance of sacred sculpture, "which should be understandable to any initiated person able to read the worth, the properties, and the nature of things by means of such images." .. As for Montaigne, we know that, for all his apparent unconcern, he relied extensively upon catalogues and reference lists of all sorts.89 He had in his own library the same collection of works on my

From this cursory review, it becomes clear that the French humanists, even the greatest among them, utilized upon occasion books of very mixed erudition--thereby avoiding the trouble of consulting the ancient sources. Nevertheless, in a more general sense, these works do not appear to have decisively influenced their intellectual development or their view of the ancient world; it is also clear that the most recent writings of the type we are considering, the manuals of Giraldi, Conti, and Cartari, were not well known or commonly used in France till the last years of the sixteenth century or even later-and then thanks to translations or adaptations made by du Verdier,82 Jacques de Montlyard,82 and Baudouin."'
*
THE INVASION of England by the gods was no less widespread. The Elizabethan poets were not outdone by the Pleiade in their taste for mythological lore. But they, too, derived their learning from indirect sources--sources for the most part Italian.90 In the first place, they knew the Genealogia deorum of Boccaccio, whose Demogorgon is found in Spenser, Marlowe, and Dryden, just as he appears later in Milton, and even in Shelley; 96 also, the De deis gentium of

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANUALS 313
Giraldi, from whom George Chapman borrows a gloss for his "Hymn to Cynthia," 91 and who alone gives the complete key to his allegories.98 Giraldi, again, early in the seventeenth century was to furnish many details to Burton, author of the strange Anatomy of Melancholy.99 But Giraldi was not the only compendium that Burton had at hand, as he himself tells us: "Their carved idols [speaking of the Gentiles] were most absurd. . . . Jupiter with a ram's head, Mercury a dog's, Pan like a goat, Hecate with three heads.••• See more in Carterius and Verdurius of their monstrous forms and ugly pictures."'"' These references are to Cartari and his translator, du Verdier, and it was evidently one of the illustrated editions of Cartari that Burton had seen.101 He appears to have been so impressed with the ugliness of these illustrations that he came to regard mythology as one of the manifestations of melancholy-a product, that is, of diseased imagination. As for Natale Conti, Schoell has shown us that he, even more than Giraldi, was Chapman's constant companion. The poet, probably intrigued by Conti's systematic inquiry into the moral meaning of the myths,11"' pillaged his work (without admitting it) not only in the Shadow of Night and the Andromeda Liberata, in Ovid:s Banquet of Sence and the tragedies, but even for the pedantic notes that he appends to the hymns. Bacon, in turn, is greatly indebted to the Mythologia of Conti, from which, as the analyses and comparisons of Lemmi ha'l/e pro'l/ed,"" the De sapientia veterum borrows not only subject matter, but method as well. Finally, we have a piece of evidence of the highest interest concerning the popularity of Cartar1 and Conti in the late sixteenth century. In his Satire II, written in 1598, John Marston takes issue with one of those poets who cram so many scholarly allusions into their work that it becomes unintelli

Thus the Imagines deorum (Cartari) and the Mythologia of Natales Comes (Conti) are the works which Marston calls upon spontaneously to help him resolve the enigmas posed by contemporary poets. As for the Hooke of Epithetes, it may he Ravisius Textor's which is meant.'05 It would seem that Marston had all these works conveniently at hand ("reach me") on his library shelves-proof that they were currently consulted at the time, and that they served as indices not only for poets, but for their readers as well. We have left till the last a problem of great difficulty, that of the mythological sources in Shakespeare.108 This problem, which has frequently been raised, invariably arouses controversy. Some critics share the belief that Shakespeare, also, got his knowledge of Fable indirectly, perhaps by way of contemporary compilations or manuals.'°' It has been conjectured that he

made use of Textor's Officina. With more precision, his indebtedness to the emblematists Alciati, Symeoni, Sambuc, and Whitney has been postulated, not only for "devices" and allegories, but also for a large number of mythological allusions scattered throughout his work.1°" Finally, there are certain indications pointing to Shakespeare's having known the lmaginz of Cartari. At all events, it is to the lmagini that one must tum for help in solving the enigma posed by a Shakespearean heraldic emblem devised by Bacon.'00
*
MYTHOLOGICAL pageants and other entertainments were much in vogue in England, as they were in France and Italy; masquerades and ballets, in particular, flourished under the name of "masques" in the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth.110 Their brilliance may be inferred from the fact that many of them were composed collaboratively by one of the leading poets of the time and one of the finest artists-Ben Jonson 111 and Inigo Jones. Jonson's verses have come down to us, and Jones' drawings for settings and costumes. In these Festivals of Thetys and Triumphs of Neptune, the gods are for the most part caparisoned with accessories so mysterious that it is very difficult to identify them. It is obvious that Ben Jonson, as a humanist, searched his memory for curious details not

He consulted, in addition to several emblem books, that / conologia by Ripa into which, as we have seen,"' all the elements of late fifteenth-century learning were drawn together, there to be converted into a set of moral cha1ades.
*
NoT ONLY France and England, but Germany and Spain offer evidence of the diffusion of the manuals, and especially of the Italian group. We have already spoken of Georg Pictor,"' and have shov.n that his Magazine of the Gods represents a lmk in the tradition connecting Boccaccio and Giraldi. We also know that the Heydenwelt of Johann Herold,"' coming after Giraldi's Historia, is diiectly derived from it. The author-who, incidentally, makes use of other contemporary works of learning as well--explains in his "Address to the Reader" that he has felt it necessary to set forth in the vulgar tongue, for the benefit of those unfamiliar with any other, the subject-matter treated by his Italian predecessor. He has tried, he says, within the limits of his own ability, to take the earlier work as his model. The Roman Antiquities of Johann Rosen,11" published in 1583, continues the same tradition. Book 11, dealing with the gods and their temples, is a compilation of Albricus (that is to say, the author of the Libellus), Boccaccio, Picto1, and above all Giraldi. Following Giialdi's example, Rosen's iconography contains borrowings from sculptured reliefs, fiom medals (for the allegories), and from emblems (for the figures of Cupid, Hercules, etc.) ; but it is a curious fact that in describing the majo1 gods he limits himself, fo1 the most part, to copying the exact words of the Libellus."" Rosen gives little space to interpretations. He mentions the euhemeristic explanations, including the extravagant genealogies of Goropius Becanus (in connection with Saturn); and parallel to these gives, without discussing them,

the physical explanations of the Stoics (apropos of Juno, for instance). He seems to know, but disregards, the moral interpretations. Finally, in the seventeenth century, the monumental lconologia deorum of Sandrart 117 reveals its remoter origins from the first page on; Boccaccio's Demogorgon is given the place of honor. The work, it is true, boasts of its use of antique monuments: "Greek and Roman statues, objects in marble, ivory, agate, and onyx"; but it is still in large part founded on the Italian mythog• raphers and emhlematists of the preceding century-Alexander of Naples, Alciati, Valeriano, Conti, Cartari. The very illustrations derive to some extent from the /magi,ni degli dei: the plates executed for the Cartari work by the engraver Ferroverde under the direction of Pignoria represented, as we have seen,118 a certain progress toward archeological correctness. Sandrart con• tinues this effort, but it is not difficult to recognize his prototypes. In Spain, in 1585, there appeared in Madrid an imposing work entitled Philosophia secreta donde debaxo de historias fabulosas, se contiene mucho. doctrina provechosa a todos estudios, con el origgen de los idolos, o dioses de la gentilidad. The author, Juan Perez de Moya, known especially as a mathematician, was also a learned humanist; but though he seems to be familiar with the classics, his scholarship has a distinctly medieval cast. The names of the Fathers and the encyclopedists (that of Isidore in particular) come con• stantly to his pen; he quotes Albricus several times, and follows Boccaccio in establishing the genealogy of the gods. He even utilizes more recent sources, like Alexander of Naples and Natale Conti. In its general conception, furthermore, his work has more than one point of resemblance with Conti's Mythologia. Like his Italian predecessor, Perez de Moya distinguishes clearly between the different types of interpretation which can be given to a single fable (Chap. 11: "Delos sentidos que se puede dar a una fabula"), and applies them all in succession. The description of each divinity and of his adventures are in most instances followed by a triple declaraci6n, historical, physical, moral. The third type of interpretation is of greatest concern to him, for, as the title of the work indicates, he sees in mythology above

all its "hidden philosophy." One whole book, the fifth, is devoted to the study of fables "which exhort men to flee vice and to follow virtue"; and in the seventh and last he treats of those which were invented in order to "inspire the fear of God." The Philosophia secreta went through many editions; m but the collection which was to attain the greatest popularity in Spain was the Teatro de los dioses de la gentilidad by Fray Baltasar de Victoria, prior of the convent of San Francisco in Salamanca. This book appeared in 1620, with an "approbation" by Lope de Vega himself-a curious document which makes clear once again that allegorical interpretation formed the ideal safe-conduct for the gods. Lope declares that nothing in mythological history ciontravenes faith or morality; on the contrary, it is a science of great importance for literary understanding. The ancients shrouded philosophy in Fable, beneath the surface beauties of poetry, painting, and astrology. All the pagan theologians, from Hermes Trismegistus to the divine Plato, hid their explanations of nature in symbols and hieroglyphs-as the Timaeus and the poimandres tell us of the Egyptians-so that the sacred truths might be hidden from vulgar minds. Lope de Vega goes on to say that a hook of this sort in the Spanish language, showing great erudition on the part of the author, has been much needed. Italy and France have already produced several such works. Now the Teatro de los dioses is a compilation based on these very French and Italian manuals: the Officina of Textor, the Discours de la religion des anciens Romains of du Chou!; the emblem books of Alciati and Valeriano, with the glosses added by their commentators; lastly, the Mythologia of "Natal Comite" (Natale Conti), and the lmagini of Cartari.120 It is by way of these intermediaries that Fray Baltasar de Victoria harvests the classical tradition, encumbered with all its medieval accretions.

sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and that several of them, in fact, knew the touch of illustrious hands. It is too soon to arrive at conclusions as to the real influence which they exerted on the various literatures; only long and detailed research can determine the exact nature and extent of that influence--wh1ch, for that matter, did not reach its height till the sevententh century. But one fact is clear, which seems to us of far-reaching importance--the Renaissance humanists did not in every case nor at all times drink directly from the pure and life-giving waters of antiquity. Their mythological science is derived, at least in part, from contemporary compilations. The greater number of these compilations, and the most important of them, come from Italy; in this domain, as in so many others, it is thus frequently by way of Italy that sixteenth-century Europe gains its knowledge of antiquity. But of what antiquity? The heritage which Italy in this case distributes among the other nations is not the treasure of classical mythology, suddenly brought to light, recovered intact; it is a deposit that she herself has received, in part, from alien sources-a deposit made up of a variety of contributions, where some gold pieces shine among the time-worn copper coins. Many of the gods whom Italy sends out for the conquest of other peoples have come to her-or come hack to her-from great distances; they are adventurers who have been roaming the world for hundreds of years.
*
AT THE CONCLUSION of this study, let us attempt to formulate what we have been able to learn from it of the Renaissance, its nature, and the causes of its decline. The long history of the gods, as we have outlined it here, brings forward a supporting a1gument for those who refuse to see the Renaissance as a break with the past, an initiation of something completely new.'01 One can no longer speak-at least or not literally-of a "rebirth" of the gods, when one has followed their fortunes, as we have done, from late antiquity on; when one has watched them being absorbed into medieval culture, which saves them from
101 See, for instance, C. Doutrepont, / ean. Lemaire de Belges el la Renmssan.ce, Introduction.



820 TBE SURVIPAL OF THE PAGAN GODS
oblivion and protects them from hostility; when one has seen elaborations and new glosses constantly added to that tenacious, uninterrupted tradition which gathers up all that has survived of the fabulous world of the ancients and transmits it as common currency down through the ages; when one has gazed at the great mass of naive or barbaric images, scattered offshoots of the Olympian line-obscure in their descent, no doubt, but still endowed with the divine right of immortality. For these last, the survivors, the Renaissance was no more than a Fountain of Youth within which to bathe their deformed and impotent limbs. But then, for a time, other divinities did eclipse them by their triumphant beauty, rising from their ancestral soil after a sleep of a thousand years, having known neither decadence nor exile. It is indeed worthy of note that during the most radiant period of the Renaissance, the iconographical types that had been "handed down," and therefore altered, were almost everywhere abandoned in favor of types "rediscovered" in their primal purity. It is also significant that during the same period there seems to be an interruption in the mythographical tradition, at least in Italy (no Italian history of the gods appeared between Boccaccio and Giraldi). It is as if nothing more was now needed, in order to know and understand the gods, than to look out at the surrounding world and listen to the voice of instinct; as if man had at last penetrated to the inner meaning of mythology, now that he was engaged in rehabilitating, along with physical beauty, the realm of nature and the flesh. But beneath this gaiety and enthusiasm lurks a stubborn disquiet; just because a "pagan" cult of life is now being professed, with the gods as its incarnation, the need is felt of bringing that cult into line with the spiritual values of Christianity-of reconciling the two worlds. Humanism and art appear, for a brief moment, to have succeeded in accomplishing this result; the Renaissance, in its moment of flowering, is this synthesis-or rather, this fragile harmony. But the equilibrium is disturbed after only a few decades. The sixteenth century, as it advances, is forced to avow the disaccord which it thought had been successfully hidden. An era of crisis and reaction then dawns. The gods no longer arouse the same sentiments. Zeal is succeeded by



THE INFLUENCE OF THE MANUALS 821
admiration grown reticent and overscrupulous; intoxication with beauty, by a cold archeological interest, by scholarly curiosity. From being objects of love, the gods are transformed into a subject of study. Thus the medieval tradition of the libri de imaginibus deorum is born again, and by a strange cycle of return, the gods of Martianus Capella once more appear. Once more, as in the twilight of the ancient world, the Olympians give way before the idols of Egypt and Syria. But at the same time, since the gods cannot be ex• eluded from art, poetry, or education, a compromise is more than ever necessary to satisfy the demands and conventions of morality, and the traditional compromise consists in presenting each of the gods as an edifying symbol. Thus the allegorical method dear to the Middle Ages flourishes again with new vigor. All mythology is nothing more--or pretends to be nothing more-than a system of ideas in disguise, a "secret philosophy." Increasingly erudite and diminishingly alive, less and less felt but more and more intellectualized "'"-such, from now on, it seems, is to be the inescapable evolution of mythology. Indeed, the discussions which take place in seventeenth-century France, for example, on the topic of the "men·eilleux pai'en"-the arguments advanced by the defenders of the gods, as well as by their adversaries "'-give proof of the drying up of poetic sentiment in the realm of Fable, which is now regarded as no more than "un amas de nobles :fictions" and "ornements r~us" '"' or as an adjunct in teaching, intended for the edification of the young, and especially for the instruction of

Bossuet, as he himself told Innocent XI, taught the Dauphin hthe fables of pagan Theology " Fenelon, in turn, taught them to the Duke of Burgundy, "who loved fables and mythology." Cf. Abbe de Villiers, Poesies, p 207: "De !'education des rois."

to the functions of chamberlains or tutors experience astonishing revivals of power and acquire new prestige. At precisely the moment when, in Italian art, mythology is being relegated to the stage machinery of opera, Flanders, with Rubens, recalls it to primitive realities, to brute and elemental force. Sated with wine, gorged with meats and fruits, the gods are nourished to a point where their majesty, it is true, may he lost, hut their animal vigor reappears. The naturalism 0£ the North once more lends them its own flesh and blood, while the intoxicating effects of pantheism free them from all restraint. With Poussin, meditating in Rome in the silence 0£ the ruins, the gods are surrounded by a different atmosphere, strangely dreamlike and grave. We feel that for this artist the world of Fable represents the Golden Age, gone never to return; everything breathes regret for that lost world and for its serene delights. The fact is that the ancient world has become irrevocably detached from our own; it is an enchanted isle, lost beyond a luminous horizon, forever invisible. The sentiment of nostalgia which pervades the work of Poussin is the fruit, at once bitter and delicious, of the Renaissance; it means that the perspectives of the mind have changed. The notion of antiquity as a distinct historical milieu, as a period that had run its course, did not exist in the Middle Ages; and this is the cause of the relative facility, so surprising to us, with which, in spite of the immense revolution created by Christianity, medieval thought found points of agreement and formulas for reconciliation with the pagan spirit. The Renaissance, on the other hand, perceived this historical distance, and had to make a conscious effort to establish harmony between two worlds separated by a lapse 0£ centuries. When this effort £ailed, "the antique world . . . which had proved incompatible with Christian culture, appeared all the more as a perfect harmony in itself. . • ." In that world, "physical beauty and carnal desires, heroic pathos and playful amorousness, had never entered into conflict with moral or theological conceptions."""

-the memory of those ages when beings stronger and more beautiful than ourselves

tasted without deceit or disquiet the joys of that imaginary kingdom, that serene Arcadia, toward which the anguished mind of modem man turns for refuge among the gods.
