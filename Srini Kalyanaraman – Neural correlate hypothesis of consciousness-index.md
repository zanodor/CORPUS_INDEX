Tithi in Pañcāṅga & Metaphors of Time, divinities
Mahākāla, Mahākālī
Where from did Babylonians learn about tithi for their lunar calendar? There is no answer in p.128 of O. Neugebauer's Exact Sciences in Antiquity, 1949 https://ia800708.us.archive.org/12/items/TheExactSciencesInAntiquity/The%20Exact%20Sci ences%20in%20Antiquity.pdf

The Tithis or the distances between the sun and the moon are also deified, but these cannot be properly determined in the absence of definite iconographic information. Some of these Tithis (dates) are found represented in the Chinese collection at Peiping. Figs. 224 and 245 illustrate the Navamī and Daśamī Tithis. (Based on extracts of the Sadhanamala English
translation. These plates and illustrations represent either photographs of sculptures or linedrawing reproductions of paintings or other representations of Buddhist artwork.)
Fig. 242: Rāhu (Peiping)
From time immemorial people in India believed in the power of the planets either for evil or for good. That belief is still current. The Hindus, Buddhists and Jainas alike shared in this belief, and in all these three religious systems the planets were deified [viz., Rāhu] and they were given a form, weapon and colour. To compare the forms of the different planets in the three religious systems is itself an independent and stupendous study. [...]
Rāhu:
Colour: reddish-blue; Arms: two; Symbol: sun and moon;
The eighth deity in this series of Nine Planets, is the destructive deity Rāhu. His form is as under: “Rāhu is reddish blue in colour, and he holds in his two hands the Sun and the Moon”.

As Rāhudeva he occurs once in the Chinese collection. This Chinese statuette is illustrated in Fig. 242.
Ketu:
Colour: blue; Arms: two; Symbol: sword and snake-noose.
The ninth and the last in the series of deities representing the Nine Planets is Ketu. He is
described thus in the Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala: “Ketu is blue in colour and holds the sword and the noose of snake”.
Under the name Ketugrahadeva, he occurs once in the Chinese collection. Fig. 243 illustrates this Chinese specimen. Fig. 243: Ketu (Peiping)

[Note: Pañcāṅga or the five aspects of reckoning time for each day, computed and recorded in Hindu almanacs are:
i. Vāra (day of the week), ii. Tithi (lunar day), iii. Nakṣatra (the Constellation through which the moon moves), iv. Yoga (Sum of the longitudes of the Sun and the Moon), and v. Karaṇa (half-tithi).
All these reckonings have religious and ritualistic significances.
The verses in this chapter are all of a highly cryptic nature and, like philosophical aphorisms, imply much more than what is actually expressed, and can be correctly understood only with suitable explanations. While the implied information is given brackets in the translation, an example is worked out in the Notes illustrating the working, step by step.]
God Agni said:
1a. Time is (reckoned by) the accumulated number of years, (months etc., from the epoch up to the point of time under consideration). I shall set forth the calculation involved in reckoning time.
1b. The accumulated (i.e. elapsed) number of years (up to the required point of time) is to be multiplied by 12 (arka) and the (number of months elapsed in the current year from) Citrā is to be added to the product)[1]
2a. The sum obtained is doubled and placed at two places. To one is added 4 (veda) and to the other 865 (pañcāṅgāṣṭa). (The latter figure is to be divided by 60 and the quotient added to the first, while the remainder is kept as the second figure). The resultant is to be called ‘guṇa’.[2]
2b. (The guṇa) is placed at three places (one below the other, in the serpentine fashion, each being written one step to the right of the preceding one). The ‘middle’ is multiplied by 8
(vasu) and the product again multiplied by 4 (veda). (The columns are to be added up.) and again written as ‘upper’, ‘middle’ and ‘lower’.[3]
3. Subtract 398 (aṣṭa-randhra-agni) from the lower and 87 (saika-rasāṣṭaka) from the
‘middle’. Divide (the ‘middle’ and the ‘lower’) by 60 and add the quotients to the preceding, (keeping the remainders in their places).[4]
4a. Vāra-tithi correction. The first (i.e. ‘upper’) when divided by 7 will give the week-day constant for tithi. (The quotient is to be rejected as of no more use.) The resultant is to be used as the Vāra-correction for tithi-nāḍikās.[5]
4b-5. Nakṣatra-Yoga constants. The ‘guṇa’ derived above is to be multiplied by 2, and 3 subtracted from the second figure. Guṇa is set down before the result (in the serpentine fashion). 30 (kha-rāma) is set down below the last figure, and 6, 12 and 8 (rasa-arka-aṣṭa), respectively, below the three figures, (and the columns added up and elevated by dividing by



5
60). Divide the first figure by 28 and place it below the ‘correction for tithi’ (obtained in verse 4a). (add and take the result as a second ‘upper’).[6]
6-8a. The ‘guṇa’ is halved, 3 subtracted (from its second figure) and the whole expression multiplied by 2. The first figure here is multiplied by 11 (rudra); the second figure is increased by 1 and divided by 39, the quotient being subtracted from the first figure and the remainder kept in its place. The resultant is termed madhya. Subtract 22 from the first figure and divide it by 60; the remainder is deductive; the quotient is added to the (second) ‘upper’ (of verses 4b-5). The first figure is divided by 27 and the remainder set down in its place. The resultant expression is the constant for the correction of nakṣatra and yoga.[7]
8b-9a. Nakṣatra. For the calculation of tithi, there is a monthly constant, being 2 piṇḍas (i.e. whole units) and 32 nāḍikās (which has to be added to the tithi correction contained in verses 4a). Similarly, for the nakṣatra, there is a monthly constant, being 2 nakṣatras and 11 nāḍikās, (which, when added to the nakṣatra correction of verse 8a, will give the elapsed nakṣatra and the nāḍikās gone in the current nakṣatra.)[8]
9b-10. Weekday and commencing point of Tithi. Add the tithi-correction above (to the vārāditithi correction got in verse 4a), placing the tithi number below the vāra number. Divide by 7 (if vāra plus tithi exceeds 7); the remainder will give the elapsed week-day counted from Sunday, and the nāḍikās gone in the next day at the point of the commencement of the relevant tithi) In the case of tithis after adding the complete units (Piṇḍakas), the sum should be divided by 14 (if the sum exceeds 14, and the remainder taken as the tithi.)[9]
11-14a. True-Tithi correction. The correction, in nāḍikās, for the fourteen tithis would be, in order, minus, plus, plus, minus, (minus and so on). While the correction for the 14th tithi is zero), the correction for the thirteenth and the first is 5 (vināḍikās) (each, minus and plus, respectively), that for the 12th and the 2nd, 10 (vināḍikās), that for the 11th and 3rd, 15 (vināḍikās), that for the 10th and 4th, 19 (vināḍikās), that for the 9th and 5th, 22 (vināḍikās), that for the 8th and the 6th, 24 (vināḍikās), and that for the 7th, 25 (vināḍikās). These khaṇḍakas (correction-bits) are to be applied appropriately to the piṇḍakas (full units).[10]
14b-17a. Vikālā correction. In the case of (the three), Karkaṭaka, (Siṃha and Kanyā), divide the rāśis, respectively, by 6 (ṛtu), 4 (veda) and 3 (traya); in the case of Tulā, (Vṛścika and Dhanus), divide, respectively, in the reverse, i.e. by 3, 4 and 6; in the case of Makara, (Kumbha and Mīna), respectively, by 3, 4 and 6; and in the case of Meṣa, (Ṛṣabha and Mithuna), divide, respectively, in the reverse, i.e. by 6, 4 and 3. The correction, in vikalās, which is positive in the case of the three, Meṣa etc., are 50 (kha-iṣu), 40 (khayuga) and 12 (mitra); in the case of the three, Karkaṭaka etc., it is in the reverse order, (i.e. 12, 40 and 50, but positive); in the case of the three, Tula etc., (it is 50, 40 and 12), negative; (and, in the case of the three, Makara etc., it is 12, 40 and 50, negative).[11]
17b-19a. Application of the vikalā correction. The vikalā correction is to be applied to the tithi multiplied by 4. Multiply their eleven vikalās by the difference in liptās (i.e. kalās) between the elapsed and to-elapse portions of the tithi and divide by 60. If the elapsed portion is less than/the portion to-elapse, treat the correction as positive even if it be negative and or positive, retain it as positive; while, in the case of the portion toelapse being greater, the reverse is the case (i.e. the correction is to be taken as negative both if it is negative or positive).



6
19b-21a. Further correction to the Tithi. Double (?Treble) (the nāḍikās of) the tithi and subtract from it one-sixth of (the product). Apply to it the tithi-nāḍikās obtained for the sun in the reverse order, and subtract the result from 60; the true nāḍis of the tithi would be obtained. If not subtractible, add 60 and subtract; if more than 60, reduce it by 60 and subtract.[12]
21b-22. Yoga. The tithi is associated with the constellation The tithi multiplied by 4 and a third (of the tithi) added to it. Apply to it the negative correction. (By dividing it by 27, the yoga elapsed and the nāḍikās in the current yoga are obtained.) True tithi has be to be used as the means for calculating the yoga.[13]
23a. The yoga is, indeed, got also by adding (the longitudes of) the sun and the moon (in kalās and dividing by 800).[14]
23b-24a. Karaṇa. (The number of) the tithi reduced by 1 and multiplied by 2, and the product divided by 7, gives the karaṇa of day-time. The tithi-number multiplied by 2 and the product reduced by 1 and divided by 6 (kṛta) gives the karaṇa of the night.[15]
24b-c. The karaṇa of the end (i.e. second half) of the 14th tithi of the dark fortnight is called Śakuni; (that of the first half of the full moon day is called Catuṣpada; that of the end (i.e. second half of the full moon day) is called Ahi (Nāga); and that of the beginning (i.e. first half) of the prathamā (of the bright fortnight) is called Kiṃstughna.

[7]: The guṇa (264-27) is halved (132-14), 3 subtracted from the second figure (132-11) and multiplied by 2 (i.e. 264-22). The first figure is multiplied by 11 (i.e. 2904); to the second figure 1 is added (i.e. 23) and divided by 39 and the remainder (i.e. 23) is retained. This is termed the new 'middle'. Subtracting 22 from the first figure (i.e. 2882-23) and elevating by 60, we get 48-2-23.

Adding the tithi-constant (2-32-00) to the vāra-tithi correction (5-0-10), we have 7-32-10, being the vārādi (week, day etc.) correction for the point of time taken for consideration. For the nakṣatra of that point of time, add the nakṣatra constant (2-11-00) to the nakṣatra correction (got in verses 6-8a), i.e. 7-30-38, and we have the nakṣatra as 9-4138. In other words, at the point of time taken, nine nakṣatras have passed by, and in the current 10th nakṣatra, maghā, it is 41 nāḍikās and 38 vināḍikās. [9]: Adding the tithi constant (2-32-00) to the vāra-tithi correction (5-0-10). we get 7-32-10 for the week, day, which means that 7 days have elapsed as / counted from Sunday, and at the point of time in consideration, i.e. Śuklapratipad in Vaiśākha, it is Sunday at 32 nāḍikās and 10 vināḍikās (Mean). [10]: The nāḍikā corrections enunciated are:
Tithi Nāḍikā corr. Tithi Nāḍikā corr.
14 0 1 +5
13 -5 2 +10
12 -10 3 +15
11 -15 4 +19
10 -19 5 +22
9 -22 6 +24
8 -24 7 +25
[11]: The vikālā corrections enunciated are:
Month Divisor Corr. Month Divisor Corr.
Karkaṭaka 6 +12" Makara 6 -12"
Siṃha 4 +40" Kumbha 4 -40"
Kanyā 3 +50" Mīna 3 -50"
Tulā 3 +50" Meṣa 3 -50"
Vṛścika 4 +40" Ṛṣabha 4 -40"
Dhanus 6 +12" Mithuna 6 -12"
[12]: For the third tithi correction, multiply the tithi-nāḍikās, 32-10 (of verses 9b-10) by 3 (i.e. 9630), and deduct a sixth thereof (i.e. 16-5), resulting in 80-25. Adding to this the tithināḍikās (32-10), we get 112-35. The correction for one tithi (viz. 5 nāḍikās, of verse 11-14a) being applied negatively, we get 107-35. Dividing it by 60, the true nāḍikās in the current tithi is got at 47-35. [13]: Yogas form variable divisions of time during which the joint motion of the Sun and the Moon in longitude is 13° 20' or 800 kalās. In a cycle there are 27 yogas, some of them being considered as auspicious and others inauspicious. Their significances are taken due note of in deciding upon the times for rituals and domestic ceremonies. The 27 yogas are:



9
1. Viṣkambha, 2. Prīti, 3. Āyuṣmān, 4. Saubhāgya, 5. Śobhana, 6. Atigaṇḍa, 7. Sukarmā, 8. Dhṛti, 9. Śūla, 10. Gaṇḍa, 11. Vṛddhi,
12. Dhruva, 13. Vyāghāta, 14. Harṣaṇa, 15. Vajra, 16. Siddhi,
17. Vyatīpāta, 18. Varīyān,
19. Parigh, 20. Śiv, 21. Siddh, 22. Sādhy, 23. Śubh, 24. Śukr, 25. Brahm, 26. Indr,
27. Vaidhṛt.
Multiplying the true tithi (viz. 47-35 of verses 19-20) by 4 (i.e. 190-20) and adding a third of the tithi (viz. 15-52), we get 206-12. Dividing by 27 (which is the total number of yogas in a cycle) and rejecting the quotient, we have 7-12. i.e. 7 yogas up to Sukarmā have gone by and, in the current 8thyoga, Dhṛti, 12 nāḍikās too are over. [14]: In the alternative method of calculating the yoga, the longitudes of the Sun and the Moon are added and the sum divided by 800 (which is the said sum in terms of six kalās). The quotient will give the number of the yogas elapsed and the remainder the nāḍikās etc. elapsed in the current yoga. [15] The Karaṇa is a measure of time extending over half a tithi, having astrological significance. They carry eleven names, being: (1) Bava, (2) Bālava, (3) Kaulava, (4) Taitila, (5) Gara., (6) Vaṇija, (7) Viṣṭi, (8) Śakuni, (9) Catuṣpada, (10) Nāga and (11) Kiṃstughna. A cycle
consists of 60 karaṇas (during the 30 tithis or 60 half-tithis). The last four karaṇas occur only once and occupy the four half-tithis from the second half of the 14th of the dark fortnight to the first half of the/1st tithi of the bright fortnight, and, so, are called sthira or ‘fixed’ karaṇas, while the other seven karaṇas occupy the remaining 56 half-tithis, by repeating themselves eight times, and, so, are called cala or ‘moving’ karaṇas.

Summary: Manifestation of the guardian deities of the seven chambers of Tripurā in Śrīnagara.
Note: Though the present chapter proposes to enumerate the guards of seven chambers, actually, only two—Mahākāla in Mahā-Kāla-Cakra, (vv. 7-41) the protector of ṃe first garden and the Cakra of Vasanta (vv. 44-60) are described fully. Thus every seasonGrīṣma (Summer), Varṣā (rainy season) etc. have their cakras and the duty of protecting the gardens or parks in the remaining enclosures (vv. 58-66). Thus (Mahākāla + 6 seasons=) seven guards are appointed to these seven enclosures.
Agastya said:
1. There are deities guarding the seven enclosures beginning with that made of iron. O wise one, mention their names, so that my doubts can be cleared.
Hayagrīva said:
2. Mahākāla, the devourer of the worlds, having a dark-coloured body stays, O Pot-born sage, in the great garden of many trees.
3. He wears a dark-coloured jacket. His eyes are red on account of intoxication. He continuously drinks the tonic beverage called the universe with which the cup of cosmic egg is filled.
4. Seated in his throne of the nature Kalpāntakalana (comprehending the end of Kalpa), he looks at Mahākālī whose complexion is as dark as the cloud and who has become tenderhearted, due to the action of the god of Jove.
5. He constantly meditates on Lalitā. He is even eager to worship Lalitā. Through devotion to Lalitā, he enhances his longevity. He is served by the servants the most important among them being Kāla and Mṛtyu.[1]
6. Mahākālī and Mahākāla carry out the orders of goddess Lalitā. They stay in the first path (enclosure). They seize and impel the entire universe.
Kālacakra:
7. The Kālacakra (circle of Mahākāla) of Mātaṅga (?) forms his seat. It has
four Āvaraṇas (outer coverings) and is rendered beautiful with the Bindu (point) at the centre.
8. The four Āvaraṇas are (1) triangle, (2) pentagon, (3) lotus of sixteen petals, (4) lotus of eight petals or spokes (radii). Mahākāla is in the centre.



11
9. In the (vertices of the) triangle three great deities, the Śaktis of Mahākāla, viz.: Mahākālī[2], Mahāsandhyā (great Dusk) and Mahāniśā (great night) are stationed.
10. There itself in the vertices of the Pentagon are stationed the five Śaktis, viz.: Pratyūṣa, (Dawn), Pitṛprasu (Twilight) when Pitṛs are abroad), Prāhṇa (Forenoon), Aparāhṇa (Afternoon), Madhyāhna (Noon).
11-13. Then, O sage, listen to the Śaktis stationed in the lotus of sixteen petals. They are (the various parts of time such as Dina (Day), Niśā (Night), Tamisrā (Dark Night), Jyotsni (Moon light
Night), Pakṣiṇī, Pradoṣā, Niśīthā, Praharā, Pūrṇimā, Rākā, Anumati, Amāvāsyā, Sinīvālī, Ku hū, Bhadrā, the sixteenth Uparāgā. These are remembered as the sixteen Śaktis stationed in the sixteen petals.
14-17. (The units of Time, such
as) Kalā, Kāṣṭhā, Nimeṣa, Lava, Kṣaṇa, Truṭi, Muhūrta, Kutapa[?], Horā, Śuklapakṣa, Kṛṣṇa pakṣa, Ayana, Viṣuva, the thirteenth. Saṃvatsarā, Parivatsarā and Iḍāvatsarā—these are remembered as the Śaktis stationed in the lotus of sixteen petals.
Years forming a yuga in Vedic works such
as Iḍvatsarā, Induvatsarā (N. Udvatsara), Avatsarā and Tithi, Vāra, Nakṣatra, Yoga and Kar aṇa—these Śaktis are stationed in the lotus with eight petals.
18. Kali, Kalpa, Kalanā and Kālī, these four are the doorkeepers of the shining Kālacakra.
19. All these deities of Mahākāla are the wives of Kāla. Due to intoxication, they have laughing faces. They hold goblets of red lustre filled with liquor. They are darkcomplexioned.
20. They are always absorbed in worshipping, eulogising, meditating upon and repeating the names of Lalitā. They serve Mahākāla seated in Kālacakrāsana.
21. Then, O Pot-born sage, the (guard) of Kalpakavāṭī is Vasanta—the spring season: (Vasanta) of great splendour, the favourite servant of Lalitā.
22. He is seated on a flowery throne. He is reddened due to intoxication by the liquor extracted from the honey of flowers. Flowers are his weapons and ornaments. He appears splendid with a flowery umbrella.
23.[3] Madhuśrī and Mādhavaśrī—these two deities are the wives of that shining lord (Vasanta)[3]. Both of them are inebriated through the spirituous liquor extracted from flowers. They are ardently desirous of the god of love having flowers for his arrows.
24. The defender of Santānavāṭikā is Grīṣmartu (the summer season) of fiery eyes. He is the servant of Lalitā, continuously carrying out her commands.
25.[4] Śukraśrī and Śuciśrī are remembered as his two wives.
Haricandanavāṭī, O sage, is occupied by Varṣartu (the rainy season).
26-28a. That Varṣartu has great splendour. Lightning-streaks are his tawny eyes. He is highly resonant with thunderbolt as his boisterous laughter. He has haughty clouds for his vehicle. He is covered with clouds like coats of mail. He holds a jewel-set bow. He is absorbed in



12
worshipping, eulogising, meditating upon and repeating the names of Lalitā. He is, O conqueror of Vindhya, one who gives great delight to all the three worlds.
28b-29. His Śaktis are said to be twelve,
viz.[5] Nabhaśrī, Nabhasyaśrī, Svarasā, Svara- (N. Sasya)Mālinī, Ambā, Dulā, Nirali (N. Sarasā), Abhrayanī, Meghayantrikā, Varṣayantī, Cibuṇikā (N. of a star in Kṛttikā) and Vāridhārā. They shower rain. They have eyes reddened due to inebriation.
30-32. Along with those Śaktis, Varṣartu (the Rainy Season) always worships Lalitā, the
supreme goddess, with clusters of flowers raised by himself. He repeats her names. He adorns the countries of I he devotees of Lalitā by means of his wealth. He always torments the land of her enemies by means of drought. Such is the rainy season, the servant of the goddess.
33. Śaradṛtu (the Autumn) stays permanently in the grove of Mandāra trees and protects that chamber. He is splendidly glorious. He delights the mind of the world.
34. Iṣaśrī and Ūrjaśrī[6] are the beloved ones of that season. They gather water and with clusters of flowers raised by himself, he worships dthe empress, the consort of Śrīkāmeśvara.
35-36. Hemantartu (Season of early winter) of great splendour has his physical body as cool as snow (cool on account of snow). His face is always delightful. He is the favourite servant of Lalitā. By means of clusters of flowers raised by himself, he worships the supreme goddess (Parameśvarī). He defends the park of Pārijāta. He subdues even fire. Sahaḥśrī and Sahasyaśrī are his two excellent consorts.[7]
37-39. The guard of the grove of Kadamba Trees is Śiśirartu (the season of winter) of cool features, O excellent sage born of pot. Therefore, the entire surface of the land of that chamber is rendered cool by him. Therefore, Śyāmā, the deity residing there is also of cool nature and features. His two excellent consorts are Tapaḥśrī and Tapasyaśrī.[8] Along with them he worships Lalitā, the mother who sanctifies the universe.
Agastya said:
40-42. O Gandharvavadana (Hayagrīva) O glorious one, among the seven chambers (and
parks) consisting of different kinds of trees Mahākāla, the guardian of the first Park has been heard by me. His Cakra (wheel or group) has been glorified by you as having four outer coverings. It is also heard from you that the guardianship of the Kalpaka and other parks belonged to the six seasons. But the deities of the Cakra are not heard (in respect of the seasons). Hence, recount in the proper order the protecting deities (Āvaraṇa deities) of the outer coverings of the Cakra of vasanta and others, since O holy lord, you are omniscient and great.
Hayagrīva said:
43-45. Listen, O excellent sage, to the (enumeration of deities stationed in different Cakras (mystical circles). Kālacakra has been mentioned before. Vasantacakra (the mystical circle of spring season) is being described. It has seven outer coverings, viz.: (1) Triangle, (2) Pentagon, (3) Lotus with eight petals, (4) Lotus with sixteen petals (? Spokes), (5) Lotus with ten petals, (6) The same and (7) a square. In the centre of all, the deity of the spring season, of great brilliance is stationed in the Bindu (point) of the Cakra.



13
46-48. Both the consorts Madhuśrī and Mādhavaśrī are seated on his lap. Vasantartu (has four hands). With two of his hands he holds fast the breasts of his consorts, one of the breasts of one with one hand and one of the breasts of the other with the other hand. With the other pair of his hands, he holds the goblet of wine rendered fragrant with flowers and a piece of meat. The mental representation of the persona] figure of all the Ṛtus (Seasons) should be carried out in this manner, O suppressor of Vindhya. In the course of mental representation of Varṣartu (Rainy season), it should be known that the first two Śaktis (viz.: Nabhaḥśrī and Nabhasyaśrī) arc seated on his lap and the other (ten) arc close to him.
49-56 Now listen to the enumeration of deities stationed in the circle of Vasanta. (There are altogether sixty of them, thirty are Tithis pertaining to Madhuśrī and thirty (Tithis) pertaining to Mādhavaśrī). The deities (of Madhuśrī) are Madhuśuklaprathamikā, Madhuśukladvitīyā, Madhuśuklatṛtīyā, Madhuśuklacaturthikā, Madhuśuklapañcamī, Madhuśuklaṣaṣṭhikā, Madhuśuklasaptamī, Madhuśuklāṣṭamī, Madhuśuklanavamī, Madhuśukladaśamī, Madhuśuklaikādaśí, Madhuśukladvādaśī, Madhuśuklatrayodaśī, Madhuśuklacaturdaśī, Madhuśuklapaurṇamāsī, Madhukṛṣṇaprathamā, Madhukṛṣṇadvitīyā, Madhukṛṣṇatṛtīyā, Madhukṛṣṇacaturthī, Madhukṛṣṇapañcamī, Maḍhukṛṣṇaṣaṣṭhī, Madhukṛṣṇasaptamī, Madhukṛṣṇāṣṭamī Madhukṛṣṇanavamī, Madhukṛṣṇadaśamī. O suppressor of theVindhya, Madhukṛṣṇaikādaśī, Madhukrṣṇadvādaśī, Madhukṛṣṇatrayodaśī, Madhukṛṣṇacaturdaśī, and Madhvamā (vāsyā). These are to be known as the Śaktis (of Madhuśrī).
57-58. In this manner, there are thirty other Śaktis stationed above Mādhavaśrī beginning with Śuklapratipat (i.e. Mādhavaśuklaprathamā etc.). These two together numbering sixty are well known as Vasantaśaktis.
59-61.[9] The seats (of sixty deities in the seven outer coverings (āvaraṇa) of Vasantacakrarāja should be worshipped in the Cakra in accordance with the injunctions with their respective Mantras. There are sixty deities stationed in those sixty Bhūmis (seats). They are to be worshipped separately with their respective Mantras by the Sādhakas (Aspirants of spiritual enlightenment).
Such is the Vasantacakra. The same is the case in the other three[10]. But the deities are different according to the difference of Śukraśrī, Śuciśrī, etc. Thus there are gloriously splendid sixty Śaktis in the Grīṣmacākra.
62-63. In the same manner (understand) the different (Śaktis) belonging to Nabha and Nabhasya in the circles Varṣācakra etc. There are sixty Śaktis in each of the Cakras. Afraid of making the description voluminous, I am refraining from enumerating them.
64. These are the Śaktis pertaining to the Ṛtus (Seasons). They bestow happiness on the devotees of Lalitā. They are absorbed in worshipping, eulogising, meditating upon and repeating the names of Lalitā.
65-67. They move about, in the Cakras of Kalpavāṭikā etc. They are lazy and gracefully slow due to inebriation. They propitiate the great goddess Lalitā through the honey produced in their own respective flowers.
All of them together number three hundred and sixty. In the same manner there are deities, the guardians in the seven enclosures.

They are being recounted to you by mentioning the names also since you have asked. I shall take up the cases of other enclosures also to complete the description. Listen attentively. I shall give details and names of Śaktis also.
FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES:

The concept of Time has two aspects in this Purāṇa (i) as the destroyer of every thing and (ii) the calculator or enumerator. The so-called Kālacakra represents this complex concept. The Tantric outline of the Cakra—with Mahākāla as the centre and the figures of a triangle and a Pentagon and Lotuses with sixteen and eight petals—appears mystical. But the contents are descriptive of the concept of Kāla: Thus the three Sandhyās (twilights) are the Śaktis, in the triangle; parts of the day from dawn to noon are the Śaktis in the Pentagon, days and nights and the special days such as the full moon and new moon days are the Śaktis in 16 petals while units of time such as Kāla Kāṣṭhā etc. are the 16 Śaktis in the petals while names of
years in Vedas are the 8 petals of another lotus.
Kāla or Mahākāla as the presiding deity of this Cakra occupies the central position and is
depicted as deterrent, black-coloured, inebriated and boisterous with a suitably terrific spouse Mahākālī.

Mahākālyā (great Dawn) [3]: The season spring consists of two months Madhu (Caitra) and Mādhava (Vaiśākha); Naturally Madhuśrī (the Beauty of Caitra) and Mādhavaśrī (the beauty of Vaiśākha) are his wives. [4]: The season summer (Grīṣma) consists of two months Śukra (or Jyeṣṭha) and Śuci (or Āṣādha). Hence his two wives are Śukraśrī and Śuciśrī (the beauties of these two months).

In the list of Śaktis of the Rainy Season (Varṣartu) the first two are the names of the
Month Nabhas (Śrāvaṇa) and Nabhasya (Bhādrapada) which constitute the Rainy season. Others are the deified natural phenomena in the rainy season. [6]:
Months Iṣa (Āśvina) and Ūrja (Kārttika) cover the season called autumn. Hence they are treated as his wives. [7]:
Sahas (Mārgaśīrṣa) and Sahasya (Pauṣa) are the months which constitute the
season Hemanta. Hence these months are given feminine forms and are said to be his spouses. [8]:
The months Tapas (Māgha)and Tapasya (Phālguna) form the season called Śiśira and hence they are treated as the wives of the season Śiśira.

constitute the season Vasanta (Cakra). Similar Cakras for the remaining seasons (ṛtus) each having sixty deities (15 tithis of bright half +15 tithis of the dark half per month. A season

consists of two months. Hence 30 Tithis per month X 2 months constituting the season =60 Śaktis.)
