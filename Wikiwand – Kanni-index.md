The Kanni - also known as the Maiden's Beastmaster - is a rare indigenous South Indian sighthound breed of dog found in the state of Tamil Nadu.[3] The breed is used mainly for coursing game. Kanni name is exclusively called to black and tan and black and sable variety , while single coloured variety is known as Chippiparai.
History
Kanni is a royal indigenous hound dog breed in Tamilnadu, India.
During ancient times it was generally used for hunting by Zamindars (Aristocrat) and Landlords.[4] In the beginning such breed of dogs existed in Tamilnadu especially in Southern districts like Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Virudhunagar and Madurai.[5]
Name
The name Kanni means "pure" in Tamil and was given to this breed for its loyalty – purity of heart. The Kanni is also known as the Maiden's Beastmaster for its voracity with which it defends its territory against other wild animals and because they are often gifted to newlywed bride as their guardian.[6] Even though they had different colours in this breed gifting only black and tan coloured dogs during marriages was generally followed as a practice. This leads to the wrong naming of the black and tan coloured breeds as Kanni in dogs as well as goats in future.[7] Even though the native people call this breed as Kanni, Kennel Club of India (KCI) registered this with two names. It registered the black and tan coloured dogs of this breed as Kanni and the rest as Chippiparai respectively.

Temperament
The Kanni is usually shy but will always defend its home or master, if the need arises. The Kanni dogs are extremely faithful and easy to train but they will always think independently when on a hunt. They are good companion, loyal and friendly to family.[10]
Hunting
This breed is used for hunting deer, hare and other rodents. Kanni generally run very fast to catch their prey. It smells and traces the hare. While hunting, it can quickly respond to the hand signals and gestures of its owner towards a running rabbit. The key to the Kanni's capability as a coursing dog can be found in its light but muscular build, large heart, double suspension gallop, and extreme flexibility of its spine all like that of Cheetah.[11]
Habitat and Food Habits
Such breed dogs live in temperate climate zone. Minimum veterinary care is enough. They need free space and territory conscious. Hence this breed is suitable for village and not suitable for city life. Not a finicky eater, Kanni eats millet, corn, ragi, jowar and rice porridge with milk or curd and non-veg foods.[12]

Coursing Coursing is the pursuit of game or other animals by dogs—chiefly greyhounds and other sighthounds—catching their prey by speed, running by sight, but not by scent. Coursing was a common hunting technique, practised by the nobility, the landed and wealthy, and commoners with sighthounds and lurchers. Sighthound Sighthounds, also called gazehounds, are hounds that primarily hunt by sight and speed, instead of by scent and endurance as scent hounds do.
