PREFACE.
M. Perrot's name as a classical scholar and archaeologist,
and M. Chipiez's as a penetrating critic of architecture, stand so
high that any work from their pens is sure of a warm welcome
from all students of the material remains of antiquity. These
volumes are the first instalment of an undertaking which has
for its aim the history and critical analysis of that great organic
growth which, beginning with the Pharaohs and ending with
the Roman Emperors, forms what is called Antique Art. The
reception accorded to this instalment in its original form is
sufficient proof that the eulogium prefixed to the German trans
lation by an eminent living Egyptologist, Professor Georg Ebers,
is well deserved ; "The first section," he says, "of this work, is
broad and comprehensive in conception, and delicate in execution ;
it treats Egyptian art in a fashion which has never previously
been approached." In clothing it in a language which will, I
hope, enable it to reach a still wider public, my one endeavour has
been that it should lose as little as possible, either in substance
or form.
A certain amount of repetition is inevitable in a work of
this kind when issued, as this was, in parts, and in one place ^
I have ventured to omit matter which had already been given
at some length, but with that exception I have followed M.
Perrot's words as closely as the difference of idiom would allow.
Another kind of repetition, with which, perhaps, some readers
may be inclined to quarrel, forced itself upon the author as the

VI Preface.
lesser of two evils. He was compelled either to sacrifice detail
and precision in attempting to carry on at once the history of
all the Egyptian arts and of their connection with the national
religion and civilization, or to go back upon his footsteps now and
aeain in tracine each art successively from its birth to its decav.
The latter alternative was chosen as the only one consistent with
the final aim of his work.
Stated in a few words, that aim is to trace the course of the
great plastic evolution which culminated in the age of Pericles
and came to an end in that of Marcus Aurelius. That evolution
forms a complete organic whole, with a birthday, a deathday,
and an unbroken chain of cause and effect uniting the two.
To objectors who may say that the art of India, ot China, of
Japan, should have been included in the scheme, it may be
answered : this is the life, not of two, or three, but of one.
M. Perrot has been careful, therefore, to discriminate between
those characteristics of Egyptian art which may be referred
either to the national beliefs and modes of thought, or to
undeveloped material conditions, such as the want or supersti
tious disuse of iron, and those which, being determined by the
very nature of the problems which art has to solve, formed a
starting point for the arts ot all later civilizations. By means of
well-chosen examples he shows that the art of the Egyptians went
through the same process of development as those of other and
later nationalities, and that the real distingfuishincr characteristic of
the sculptures and paintings of the Nile Valley was a continual
tendency to simplification and generalization, arising partly from
the habit of mind and hand created by the hieroglyphic writing,
partly from the stubborn nature of the chief materials employed.
To this characteristic he might, perhaps, have added another,
which is sufficiently remarkable in an art wliich had at least three
thousand years of vitality, namely, its freedom from individual
expression. The realism of the Egyptians was a broad realism.
There is in it no sign of that research into detail which dis
tingui.shes most imitative art and is to be foimd even in that



Preface. vii
of their immediate successors ; and yet, during all those long
centuries of alternate renascence and decay, we find no vestige
of an attempt to raise art above imitation. No suspicion of
its expressive power seems to have dawned on the Egyptian
mind, which, so iar as the plastic arts were concerned, never
produced anything that in the language of modern criticism could
be called a creation. In this particular Egypt is more closely
allied to those nations ot the far east whose art does not come
within the scope of M. Perrot's inquiry, than to the great
civilizations which formed its own posterity.
Before the late troubles intervened to draw attention of a
different kind to the Nile Valley, the finding of a pit full of royal
mummies and sepulchral objects in the western mountain at
Thebes had occurred to give a fresh stimulus to the interest in
Egyptian history, and to encourage those who were doing their
best to lead England to take her proper share in the work
of exploration. A short account of this discovery, which took
place after M. Perrot's book was complete, and of some of the
numerous art objects with which it has enriched the Boulak
Museum, will be found in an Appendix to the second volume.
My acknowledgments for generous assistance are due to
Dr. Birch, Mr. Reginald Stuart Poole, and Miss A. B. Edwards.

INTRODUCTION.
I.
The successful interpretation of the ancient writings of Egypt,
Chaldsea, and Persia, which has distinguished our times, makes
it necessary that the history of antiquity should be rewritten.
Documents that for thousands of years lay hidden beneath the
soil, and inscriptions which, like those of Egypt and Persia, long
offered themselves to the gaze of man merely to excite his
impotent curiosity, have now been deciphered and made to render
up their secrets for the guidance of the historian. By the
help of those strings of hieroglyphs and of cuneiform characters,
illustrated by paintings and sculptured reliefs, we are enabled to
.separate the truth from the falsehood, the chaff from the wheat, in
the narratives of the Greek writers who busied themselves with
those nations of Africa and Asia which preceded their own in the ways of civilization. Day by day, as new monuments have been
discovered and more certain methods of reading their inscriptions elaborated, we have added to the knowledge left us by Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, to our acquaintance with those empires on the Euphrates and the Nile which were already in old age when
the Greeks were yet struggling to emerge from their primitive
barbarism.
Even in the cases of Greece and Rome, whose histories are
supplied in their main lines by their classic writers, the study
of hitherto neglected writings discloses many new and curious

details. The energetic search for ancient inscriptions, and the
scrupulous and ingenious interpretation of their meaning, which we
have witnessed and are witnessing, have revealed to us many
interesting facts of which no trace is to be found in Thucydides or Xenophon, in Livy or Tacitus ; enabling us to enrich with more than
one feature the picture of private and public life which they have
handed down to us. In the effort to embrace the life of ancient
times as a whole, many attempts have been made to fix the exact
place in it occupied by art, but those attempts have never been
absolutely successful, because the comprehension of works of art,
oi plastic creations in the widest significance of that word, demands
an amount of special knowledge which the great majority of his
torians are without ; art has a method and language of its own,
which obliges those who wish to learn it thoroughly to cultivate
their taste by frequenting the j^rincipal museums of Europe, by
visitinof distant resfions at the cost of considerable trouble and
expense, by perpetual reference to the great collections of en
gravings, photographs, and other reproductions which considera
tions of space and cost prevent the savant from possessing at
home. More than one learned author has never visited Italy or
Greece, or has found no time to examine their museums, each of
which contains but a small portion of the accumulated remains of
antique art. Some connoisseurs do not even live in a capital,
but dwell far from those public libraries, which often contain
valuable collections, and sometimes—when they are not packed
away in cellars or at the binder's—allow them to be studied by
the curious.^ The study of art, difficult enough in itself, is thus
rendered still more arduous by the obstacles which are thrown in
its w^ay. The difficulty of obtaining materials for self-improve
ment in this direction affords the true explanation of the absence,
in modern histories of antiquity, of those laborious researches
which have led to such great results since Winckelmann founded
the science of archceology as we know it. To take the case of
Greece, many learned writers have in our time attempted to retrace
its complete history— England, Germany, and France have each
contributed works which, by various merits, have conquered the
favour of Europe. But of all these w'orks the only one which
betrays any deep study of Greek art, and treats it with taste and

competence, is that of M. Ernest Curtius ; as for Mr. Grote, he has
neither a theoretic knowledge of art, nor a feeHng for it. Here
and there, indeed, where he cannot avoid it, he alludes to the
question, but in the fewest and driest phrases possible. And yet
Greece, without its architects, its sculptors, and its painters, with
out in fact its passion for beautiful form, a passion as warm and
prolific as its love for poetry, is hardly Greece at all. Much disappointment is thus prepared for those who, without
the leisure to enter deeply into detail, wish to picture to themselves
the various aspects of the ancient world. They are told of
revolutions, of wars and conquests, of the succession of princes ;
the mechanism of political and civil institutions is explained to
them ; " literature," we are told, " is the expression of social
life," and so the history of literature is written for us. All this
is true enough, but there is another truth which seems to be
always forgotten, that the art of a people is quite as clear an
indication of their sentiments, tastes, and ideas, as their litera
ture. But on this subject most historians say little, contenting
themselves with the brief mention of certain works and proper names, and with the summary statement of a few general ideas
which do not even possess the merit of precision. And where
are we to find the information thus refused ? Europe possesses
several histories of Greek and Roman literature, written with
great talent and eloquence, such as the work, unhappily left
unfinished, of Ottfried Miiller ; there are, too, excellent manuals,
rich in valuable facts, such as those of Bernhardy, Baehr, and
Teuffel ; but where is there, either in England, in France, or
in Germany, a single work which retraces, in sufficient detail,
the whole history of antique art, following it throughout its
progress and into all its transformations, from its origin to its
final decadence, down to the ej^och when Christianity and the
barbaric invasions put an end to the ancient forms of civilization
and prepared for the birth of the modern world, for the evolution
of a new society and of a new art ?
To this question our neighbours may reply that the Gcschichfe
dcr hildcndcn Kunst of Carl Schnaase ^ does all that we ask. But
that work has one great disadvantage for those who are not

Germans. Its great bulk will almost certainly prevent its ever
finding a translator, while it makes it very tedious reading
to a foreigner. It must, besides, be very difficult, not to say
impossible, for a single writer to treat with equal competence
the arts of Asia, of Greece, and of Rome, of the Middle Ages and of modern times. As one might have expected, all the parts
of such an extensive whole are by no means of equal value,
and the chapters which treat of antique art are the least satisfac
tory. Of the eight volumes of which the work consists, two are
devoted to ancient times, and, by general acknowledgment, they
are not the two best. They were revised, indeed, for the
second edition, by two colleagues whom Herr Schnaase called
in to his assistance ; oriental art by Carl von Lutzow, and that
of Greece and Rome by Carl Friedrichs. But the chapters in
which Assyria, Chaldsa, Persia, Phoenicia, and Egypt are discussed
are quite inadequate. No single question is exhaustively treated.
Instead of well-considered personal views, we have vague guesses
and explanations which do nothing to solve the many problems
which perplex archaeologists. The illustrations are not numerous
enough to be useful, and, in most cases, they do not seem to have
been taken from the objects themselves. Those which relate to
architecture, especially, have been borrowed from other well
known works, and furnish therefore no new elements for
appreciation or discussion. Finally, the order adopted by the
author is not easily understood. For reasons which have decided
us to follow the same course, and which we will explain farther
on, he takes no account of the extreme east, of China and Japan ;
but then, why begin with India, which had no relations with the
peoples on the shores of the Mediterranean until a very late date,
and, so far as art was concerned, rather came under their influence
than brought them under its own ? The fact is that Schnaase follows a geographical order, which
is very confusing in its results. To give but one example of its
absurdity, he speaks of the Phcenicians before he has said a
word of Egypt ; now, we all know that the art of Tyre and
Sidon was but a late reflection from that of Egypt ; the work
shops of those two famous ports were mere factories of cheap
Egyptian art objects for exportation.
Again, the first part of Herr Schnaase's work is already seventeen
years old, and how many important discoveries have taken place



Introduction.
since 1865 ? Those of Cesnola and Schliemann, for instance,
have revealed numberless points of contact and transmission between one phase of antique art and another, which were never
thought of twenty years ago. The book therefore is not " down
to date." With all the improvements which a new edition might
introduce, that part of it which deals with antiquity can never
be anything but an abridgment with the faults inherent in that
kind of work. It could never have the amplitude of treatment or the originality which made Winckelmann's History of Art and
Ottfried Miiller's Manual of Artistic Archcrology so successful in
their day.^
Winckelmann's History of Art among the Ancients, originally
published in 1 764, is one of those rare books which mark an epoch
in the history of the human intellect. The German writer was
the first to formulate the idea, now familiar enough to cultivated
intelligences, that art springs up, flourishes, and decays, with the
society to which it belongs ; in a word, that it is possible to write
^ Germany had long felt the want which Schnaase attempted to satisfy. As early as 1841 Franz Kugler published his Handbiich dcr Kiinsfgesc/iidtie, which embraces the whole history of art from the earliest times down, to our own day. The book was successful; the fourth edition, revised and corrected by Wilhelm Liibke (2 vols. 8vo. i86i, Stuttgart), lies before us, but to give an idea of its inadequacy as a history of ancient art, it is enough to say that the whole of the antique period, both in Greece and Asia, occupies no more than 206 pages of the first volume. The few illustrations are rot very good in quality, and their source is never indicated ; the draughtsman has taken little care to reproduce with fidelity the style of the originals or to call attention to their peculiarities ; finally, the arrangements adopted betray the defects of a severely scientific method. The author commences with Celtic monuments (dolmens and menhirs), and then passes to the structures of Oceania and America ; before commencing upon Egypt he takes us to Mexico and Yucatan. Liibke, whilst still occupied with the work of Kugler, wished to supply for the use of students and artists a book of a more elementary character ; he therefore published in i860 an 8vo volume which he called Gnmdriss der KiaistgescliicJite ; the antique here occupies 208 pages out of 720. His plan seems to us to be open to the same objection as that of Kugler ; he follows a geographical instead of an historical arrangement ; he begins with the extreme east ; he puts the Assyrians and the Persians before Egypt, and India before Assyria. His illustrations are sometimes better than those of Kugler, but many of the cuts are common to both works. Under the title Geschictite der Plastili, Overbeck and Liibke have each written a comprehensive history of sculpture. [The word "comprehensive" must here be understood in a strictly limited sense.

Ed.] The word Plastili in the language
of German critics has this special and restricted meaning—it comprises sculpture only. The work of Overbeck, far superior to that of Liibke, deserves the success which has attended it ; the tliird edition, which contains the results of the searches at Olympia and at Pergamus, is now in course of publication.

its history.! This great savant, whose memory Germany holds in
honour as the father of classic archaeology, was not content with
statino- a principle : he followed it through to its consequences ;
he beo-an by tracing the outlines of the science which he founded,
and he never rested till he had filled them in. However, now that a century has passed away since it appeared, his great work, which
even yet is never opened without a sentiment of respect, marks a date beyond which modern curiosity has long penetrated. Winckel
mann's knowledge of Egyptian art was confined to the pasticcios
of the Roman epoch, and to the figures which passed from the
villa of Hadrian to the museum of Cardinal Albani. Chaldcea and
Assyria, Persia and Phoenicia, had no existence for him ; even
Greece as a whole was not known to him. Her painted vases were still hidden in Etruscan and Campanian cemeteries ; the few
which had found their way to the light had not yet succeeded in drawing the attention of men who were preoccupied over more im
posing manifestations of the Greek genius. Nearly all Winckel
mann's attention was given to the works of the sculptors, upon
which most of his comprehensive judgments were founded ; and yet, even in regard to them, he was not well-informed. His
opportunities of personal inspection were confined to the figures,
mostly of unknown origin, which filled the Italian galleries.
The o-reat majority of these formed part of the crowd of
copies which issued from the workshops of Greece, for some
three centuries or more, to embellish the temples, the basilicas,
and the public baths, the villas and the palaces of the masters
of the world. In the very few instances in which they were
either originals or copies executed with sufficient care to be
fair representations of the original, they never dated from an
earlier epoch than that of Praxiteles, Scopas, and Lysippus.
Phidias and Alcamenes, Psonius and Polycletus, the great
1 Winckelmann's History of Ancient Art should be read in connection with his Remarks upon the History of Art, which is a kind of supplement to it, and takes the place of that new edition of which the author's premature and tragic death deprived the world. It is an answer to the objections which made themselves heard on every side ; the preface to Monimicnti uicditi (Rome, 1867, 2 vols, in folio, with 208 plates) should also be read. The method of Winckelmann is there most clearly explained. Finally, the student of the life and labours of Winckelmann may consult with profit the interesting work of Carl lusti, Whiikdmajin, sein Leben, seine Werke, uiid seine Zeitgenossen, which will give him a clear idea of the state of archfeology at the time when the German savant intervened to place it upon a higher footing.



Introduction. vii
masters of the fifth century, were only known to the historian
by the descriptions and allusions of the ancient authors.
In such a case as this the clearest and most precise of verbal
descriptions is of less value than any fragment of marble upon
which the hand of the artist is still to be traced. Who would
then have guessed that the following generation would have
the opportunity of studying those splendid groups of decorative
sculpture whose close relation to the architecture of certain famous temples has taught us so much ? Who in those days dreamt
of looking at, still less of drawing, the statues in the pediments
and sculptured friezes of the Parthenon, of the Thesaeum, of the
temples at yEgina, at Phigalia, or at Olympia ? Now if Winckel
mann was ignorant of these, the real monuments of classic
perfection, it follows that he was hardly competent to recognise
and define true archaism or to distinguish the works of sculpture
which bore the marks of the deliberate, eclectic, and over-polished
taste of the critical epochs. He made the same mistake in speak
ing of architecture. It was always, or nearly always, by the edifices
of Rome and Italy, by their arrangement and decoration, that he
pretended to e.xplain and judge the architecture of Greece.
But Winckelmann rendered a great service to art by foundincr a method of study which was soon applied by Zoega ' and by
Ennio Ouirino Visconti,- to the description of the works which
filled public and private galleries, or were being continually dis
covered by excavation. These two savants classified a vast
quantity of facts ; thanks to their incessant labours, the lines
' Zoega busied himself greatly with Egypt, and in inaugurating the study of Coptic prepared the way for Champollion. But the work which gave him a place among the chief scholars of Winckelmann is unfinished ; the Bassirilievi antichi di Roma (Rome, 2 vols. 4to. 1808) only contains the monuments in the Villa Albani, engraved by Piroli, with the help of the celebrated Piranesi. A volume containing most of his essays was givep to the world by Welcker in 181 7 {Ahhandlungen heraiisgegeben und mit Zusiifsen hegle'itet, 8vo. Gottingen), who also published his life and a volume of his correspondence (Zoega, Samtnlung seiner Bricfe und Beurthciluug seiner Wcrke. 2 vols. 8vo.

viii Introduction.
of the master's rough sketch were accented and corrected at
more than one point ; the divisions which he had introduced
into his picture were marked with greater precision ; the groups which he had begun to form were rendered more coherent and
compact ; their features became more precise, more distinct,
and more expressive. This progress was continuous, but after
the great wars of the Revohition and the Empire its march became much more rapid, and the long peace which saw tlie
growth of so rich a harv^est of talent, was also marked by a
great increase in the energy with which all kinds of historical
studies were prosecuted.
But the widest, as well as the most sudden, enlargement of
the horizon was due to a rapid succession of discoveries, some
the result of persevering searches and lucky excavations, others
rendered possible by feats of induction which almost amounted
to genius. It seemed as though a curtain were drawn up, and,
behind the rich and brilliant scenery of Graeco-Roman civilization,
the real ancient world, the world of the East, the father of
religions and of useful inventions, of the alphabet and of the
plastic arts, were suddenly revealed to us. The great work which was compiled by the savants who accompanied Bona
parte to Egypt iirst introduced the antiquities of that country
to us, and not long afterwards Champollion discovered the key to
the hieroglyphics, and thus enabled us to assign to the monuments
of the country at least a relative date.
A
little later Layard and Botta freed Nineveh from the ruins of
its own buildings, and again let in the light upon ancient Assyria.
But yesterday we knew nothing beyond the names of its kings, and
yet it sprang again to the day, its monuments in marvellous
preservation, its history pictured by thousands of figures in
relief and narrated by their accompanying inscriptions. These
did not long keep their secrets to themselves, and their in
terpretation enables us to classify chronologically the works of
architecture and sculpture which have been discovered. The information thus obtained was supplemented by careful
exploration of the ruins in Babylonia, lower Chaldaea, and
Susiana. These had been less tenderly treated by time and by man than the remains of Nineveh. The imposing ruins of the palace at Persepolis and of the tombs of the kings, had
been known for nearly two centuries, but only by the inadequate

descriptions and feeble drawings of early travellers. Ker- Porter,
Texier, and Flandrin provided us with more accurate and com
prehensive descriptions, and, thanks to their careful copies of
the writings upon the walls of those buildings, and upon the
inscribed stones of Persia and Media, Eugene Burnouf succeeded
in reconstructing the alphabet of Darius and Xerxes.
Thus, to the toils of artists and learned men, who examined
the country from the mountains of Armenia to the low and
marshy plains of Susiana, and from the deserts which border the
Euphrates to the rocks of Media and Persia, and to the philologists
who deciphered the texts and classified the monumental fragments
which had travelled so far from the scene of their creation, we
owe our power to describe, upon a sound basis and from authentic
materials, the great civilisation which was developed in Western
Asia, in the basin of the Persian Gulf. There were still many details which escaped us, but, through the shadows which every
day helped to dissipate, the essential outlines and the leading
masses began to be clearly distinguished, and the local distinc
tions which, in such a vast extent of country and so long a
succession of empires, were caused by differences of race, of
time, and of physical conditions, began to be appreciated. But, in
spite of all these differences, the choice of expressive means and
their employment, from Babylon to Nineveh, and from Nineveh to
Susa and Persepolis, presented so many points of striking similarity
as to prove that the various peoples represented by those famous
capitals all sprang from the same original stock. The elements of
writing and of the arts are in each case identical. The alphabets
were all formed upon the same cuneiform principle, notwithstand
ing the variety in the languages which they served. In the
plastic arts, although the plans of their buildings vary in
obedience to the requirements of different materials, their
sculpture always betrays the same way of looking at living
forms, the same conventions and the same motives. Every work fashioned by the hand of man which has been discovered
within the boundaries given above, displays community of style
and unity of origin and tradition.
The result of these searches and discoveries was to show
clearly that this ancient civilisation had sprung from two
original sources, the one in the valley of the Nile, the other in

Introduction,
Chaldsea. The latter was the less ancient of the two, and was
considerably nearer our own time than the epoch which witnessed
the commencement of the long series of Egyptian dynasties by
the reign of Menes. These two civilizations met and inter
mingled through the agency of the Phoenicians, and an active
and prolific interchange of ideas and products began, traces of
which are still to be found both in Egypt and Assyria.
It still remained doubtful, and the doubt has but lately been
removed, how the influence of these two great centres of culti
vation was extended to the still barbarous tribes, the ancestors of
the Greeks and Romans, who inhabited the northern and eastern
shores of the Mediterranean.
It is only within the last twenty years, since the mission of
M. Renan, that Phoenicia has become well-known to us. Several
English and French travellers, Hamilton, Fellows, Texier, among
others, had already, in the first half of the century, described
the curious monuments of Lydia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, and of
the still more picturesque Lycia, whose spoils now enrich the
British Museum ; people vaguely conjectured that through those
countries had progressed, stage by stage, from the east to the
west, the forms and inventions of a system of civilization which
had been elaborated in the distant Chaldsea. But it was not till
1 86 1 that an expedition, inspired by the desire to clear up this
very question, succeeded in demonstrating the role actually played
by the peoples inhabiting the plateau of Asia Minor. As for
Cyprus, it was but yesterday that the explorations of Lang and
Cesnola revealed it to us, with its art half Egyptian and half
Assyrian, and its cuneiform alphabet pressed into the service of
a Greek dialect. These discoveries have put us on the alert.
Not a year passes without some lucky " find," such as that of the
Palsestrina treasure, in the immediate neighbourhood of Rome, or that made by Salzmann at Rhodes. These pieces of good
fortune allow the archaeologist to supply, one by one, the missing
links of the chain which attaches the arts of Greece and Italy
to the earlier civilizations of Egypt and Assyria.
While the remains of Oriental antiquity were being thus recovered
piece by piece, secrets no less interesting and documents no less
curious were continually coming to the surface to cast new light
upon the history of classic antiquity. First came the marbles of I

the Parthenon, transferred by Lord Elgin to the British Museum
in 1816. Both artists and connoisseurs, after a short pause of
hesitation, acfreed in assertino- tliat the bas-reHefs of the frieze and
the sculptures of the two pediments excelled anything which had
previously entered into any European museum. Artists declared
that they e.xperienced a sense of beauty never felt before ; they
were face to face for the first time with the ideal of the Greeks,
as it had been conceived and realised at that happy period of
perfection which followed the disappearance of the last traces of
archaic hardness. That period was but too short. It was com
prised in a single generation, which was followed by one which
made the first steps down the slope of the decadence. During a
single lifetime a crowd of works were produced which, in spite of
differences in material and subject, were all stamped with the same
character of easy and frank nobility, of sincerity and elegant
severity, of simplicity combined w'ith grandeur. The death, or
even the old age of the great men who had produced these works,
was sufficient to lower the standard. Emphasis and a striving for
effect took the place of nobility ; under a pretence of sincerity,
artists took to a servile imitation of nature, and mannerism, with
all its weaknesses, began to disfigure their works. Art remained
at a high level in Greece, however, longer than elsewhere. The word decadence can hardly be pronounced in connection with the
admirable works produced in the fourth century before Christ, and
yet it cannot be denied that, so long as we were without original
examples from the great epoch of Pericles, we were without that
most necessary material for a history of Greek art, a knowledge
of the most masterly, the most pure, and the most elevated of her
creations. The literary historian might as well have attempted to
trace the course of her poetry without having read Sophocles,
without having heard of the Elcctra or the QLdipus Rex.
Attention being once turned in this direction, discoveries
followed each other in rapid succession. The statues from the
pediments at ^gina, so ably restored by Thorwaldsen, were
bousrht to form the nucleus of the collection at Munich.^ The
' They were discovered in 181 1 amid the ruins of one of the temples at ^gina, by a company of excavators presided over by Mr. Cockerel). They were bought by Prince Louis of Bavaria in 1812, and Thorwaldsen was occupied during several years in putting together and restoring them. They wer€ first exhibited in the Glyptothek of Munich in 1820.



xii Introduction.
study of these statues is very instructive in making clear to us the
paths whicli sculptors had to follow in their progress from the
stiffness and conventions of early periods to the ease and amplitude
of classic perfection. As for the friezes from the temple of
Apollo Epicurius, near Phigalia, they too are in the British
Museum.^ Thus brought into immediate propinquity with the
marbles from the Parthenon, with which they are almost cotem
porary, they afford us some curious information. They show us what the art of Phidias and Alcamenes became when those
sculptors had to work in what we should call " the provinces ;
" how much they preserved and how much they lost of their complete
excellence when employed upon buildings erected at less cost and
with less care than those of the capital. So far as the composition
is concerned, the consummate facility and the natural verve of the
master who supplied the sketches and models is never absent, but
the execution, which must have been left to local artists, betrays
their inferiority by its inequalities and general weakness. The same may be said of the figures with which Alcamenes and Paeonius ornamented the pediments and metopes of the Temple
of Zeus at Olympia. Even before the discoveries at yEgina and
Phigalia, the results of the French expedition to the Morea and
the beautiful fragments of sculpture brought to the Louvre from
the banks of the Alphceus, had given us reason to suspect this
inferiority of provincial art, and the excavations recently under
taken by Germany, after an interval of about half a century of
inaction, have finally removed all doubts. Neither the statues nor
the bas-reliefs, nor any other part of the decoration of the temple
at Olympia, possess the nobility and purity which distinguish the
great buildings on the Athenian acropolis. They show abundant
power and science, but also perceptible inequalities, and certain
signs of that exaggerated objectivity which we now call realism.
Each fresh discovery helps us to comprehend, not without a cer
tain sense of surprise, how much freedom and variety Greek art
possessed during its best time. There is none of that dull
uniformity which, with other races, distinguishes most of the
works of a single epoch, none of the tyranny of a single master or
school, none of the narrowness of mere fonnii/ce.
1 The debris of the temple at Bassae was explored by the same company in the year 1812, and a whole frieze was found, which was bought by the British Museum in 1815.



Introduction. xiii
The memorable exploration to which we have alluded, and
many others which it would take too long to enumerate, have not
only made known to us the most original and most fertile period of
Greek sculpture, but have given us much information as to that art
which, when combined with the statues of Phidias and Alcamenes,
reared those splendid creations which have been reconstructed
with such skill and care by the artist and the archseologist ; we
mean Greek architecture at its best, the purest and the most com
plete architecture which the world has yet seen. Every year sees
the excellent example set by Stuart and Revett,^ in the second
half of the eighteenth century, followed by an increasing number
of imitators. The smallest remains of ancient architecture are
measured and drawn with religious care ; their arrangements are
explained, their elements are grouped, their ensemble is restored
with a comprehension of their artistic conditions which steadily
gains in certainty and penetration. Blouet's interesting restora
tions of Olympia and Phigalia, published in the account of the
French expedition to the Morea,'^ excited the emulation of the young architects at the French Academy in Rome, and opened to
them a new course of study. Until then they had been contented
with the monumental buildings of Rome and its neicrhbourhood, of Latium and Campania ; a few of the more adventurous among
them had penetrated as far as Pa;stum ; but it was not till 1845
that they ventured to cross the sea and to study the ruins of
Greece and Athens ; ^ in later years they have travelled as far
as Syria and Asia Minor in search of objects for their pencils.^
But the occupants of the Villa Medici were not alone in these
researches. Doubtless, the invaluable publication which contains
the results of their labours, forms the most ample and varied
collection of documents open to the historian of architecture
among the ancients. But many other architects of different

nationalities have given their help to the work of patiently
reconstructing the past.^
Examined thus closely, and by the trained eyes of professional
artists provided with all the necessary instruments, the- relics of
antiquity yielded up secrets which would never have been
suspected by the casual observer. Thus Mr. Penrose discovered
and explained that those walls of the Propylseum and of the
Parthenon, which seemed straight to the eye, are in fact planned
on a gentle curve ; - he showed how this subtle variation was
calculated to add to the beauty of the buildings, and to augment
their effect. Hittorf arrived at still more important results through
the minute examination of the Sicilian ruins. He was the first
to describe the important part which painting played in the
decoration of Greek architecture ; he affirmed that in many parts
of their buildings the stone or marble was painted over, and that
the various members of the architecture were distinguished by
differences of tint, which gave accent to the mouldings, and
force to the figures in relief These ideas were too strongly
opposed to modern habits of thought to be received without
strong protestations. Their partisans, too, did something to retard
their acceptance by their absolute fashion of stating their con
victions, and by certain unhappy applications of their system ;
but the polychromatic principles of the Greeks are now confirmed
by too many facts to be denied.^
Of the three principal branches of ancient art, that of which
we know least is painting, properly speaking ; the art of Poly
gnotus, of Zeuxis, and of Apelles. Of this we have but few
remains, and we are obliged to take our ideas of its excellence
from the descriptions of ancient authors. We have indeed the

wall-paintings of those Campanian cities which were so long buried under the ashes of Vesuvius ; paintings which were uncovered in great numbers under the Napoleonic domination, and have in
later times been added to every year, in spite of the indolent
fashion in which the excavations have been conducted. Fraementary mural paintings of the same kind have also been
discovered in Rome and in a few other neighbourhoods. But after
all, great though the interest may be which attaches to these
works, it must not be forgotten that they are Italian rather than
Greek, that they are the decorations for the most part of small
provincial cities, and that even the best of them, when compared
with the productions of the fifth and fourth centuries before our era,
are examples of decadence. At the most they enable us to recall,
with some approach to probable truth, the taste and technical methods of the Alexandrian school.^ Winckelmann and his im
mediate successors saw the ashes cleared from the first Pompeian
wall-paintings. But they possessed no standards by which they
could define the styles of those great schools of painting which
flourished in Greece between the epoch of the Persian Wars and the beginning of the Macedonian supremacy ; such a defi
nition we may now however attempt with at least partial success. Since the time of Winckelmann hundreds and thousands of those
painted vases of burnt clay, which the public persist in calling
Etruscan, have been discovered, classified, described, and ex
plained, in such a manner as to leave unsolved scarcely any of the problems upon which they could cast a light.
Gerhard led the way in 1S31 with his famous report on the
Volscian vases ; - numerous savants have followed his example,
and nearly every day the series which they have established are
enriched by new discoveries. These vases, as we now know,
were made in many places, at Athens, at Corinth, in the Greek
cities of Africa and of Magna Graecia. They were eagerly
sought after by some of the races whom the Greeks considered
barbarous, by the Graeco-Scythians of the Crimea, as well as by

the SabelHans and the Etruscans ; the latter imitated them now and then more or less awkwardly, but it is unanimously ac
knowledged that they are an essentially Greek product, the product of an art which sprang up with the first awakening of the Greek genius, and was extinguished about two hundred years before
Christ, when the nation ceased to be creative and prolific. From
analogy with all that has passed elsewhere we are justified in
believing that, in each century, the painting of these vases, which
would belong to what we call the industrial arts, followed with
docility the example set by historical painters, and that it re
produced, so far as its resources would allow, the style and taste
of their works. If we study each series of vases in the light of
the judgments passed by the ancients upon the most celebrated
painters of Greece, we may find, by a legitimate induction, traces
now of the style of Polygnotus, now of that of Zeuxis, and again
suggestions of the hands of Apelles or Protogenes ; a vase here
and there may have even preserved more or less faithful imitations
of the actual works of those masters. These inductions and
conjectures certainly demand both prudence and delicacy of per
ception, but their principle is incontestable, and the profit to be
obtained from them is great. In the whole wreck of antiquity
there is no loss which lovers of art find so hard to bear, as the
complete annihilation of the works of those great painters whom
the ancients put at least upon the same level as their most famous
sculptors ; and who would not rejoice to be able, by the remains
of contemporary though inferior productions, to trace a reflection,
distant and feeble perhaps, but yet faithful so far as it goes, of a whole art which has been lost to the world ?
The archaeologists of the eighteenth century never dreamt of
such researches as these, still less of the results to which they
might lead ; few of them suspected what valuable aid might be
afforded to the historian of art and of antique civilization, by the
multitude of small objects—vases, gems, glass, mirrors, bronze
plaques and figures, terra-cotta bas-reliefs, and statuettes — which
are now so eagerly sought after, and which begin to form valuable
collections in most of the great museums of Europe. ^ These

objects, which were in continual use, were manufactured in pro
digious quantities for thousands of years, and their vast numbers
gave them a greatly increased chance of being preserved. In
spite of the rough usage of man, and the slower progress of
destruction due to the action of nature, a certain number of them
were sure, from the first, to find means of escape, and, from so
many examples, a few of each type have therefore come down to
us. The small size of these objects also contributed to preserve
them from destruction. In times of war and revolution the poor
and humble ones of the earth easily avoid the catastrophes which
overwhelm those who are richer, more powerful, and more con
spicuous than themselves. So it was with these little memorials
of antiquity. Their insignificance was their salvation in the
overthrow of the civilisation to which they belonged. More
numerous and better sheltered than the masterpieces of fine art,
they survived when the latter perished. Thus it is that so many
of the lighter and more fragile products of industry have sur
vived to our time, and have made us acquainted with modes of
thought and life, and with forms of plastic expression which we
should never have known without them. The painted vases, for instance, have preserved for us more than one myth of which
no trace can be found in poetry or sculpture ; and as for terra
cottas, to which the Tanagra statuettes have directed so much
attention, we may judge from the labours of M. Henzey of
the value which they possess for archaeologists, who, though
unable, like some of our amateurs, to buy them with their weight
in gold, may compare them one with another and study their
smallest details.^ Those statuettes, which are now classified in
museums in the order of their production, have shown us how
narrow and inadequate were the formulae by which the early
historians of the plastic arts attempted to define the genius of
the Greeks. Even now, the most accomplished and well-informed
critics are not always able to repress a feeling of astonishment

when they examine a collection of terra-cottas. Some of these
figures, no more than a span high, resemble the marbles of the
Parthenon in dignity and grandeur, others are full of grace and
playfulness in their outlines, and show a capricious abandon which
disconcerts for a moment even those who are least insensible
to their charm. At the bases of such works one is apt to look
for the signature of some artist of the Renaissance or of the
eighteenth century. In reality they have existed ever since
the fourth or third century before our era, and yet there is some
thing modern in their appearance. But an indescribable purity of
taste suffices to betray their real origin to all those who possess
knowledge and delicate perceptions. That origin is still Greece,
but Greece in her lighter and more playful moments, when,
leaving the representation of gods and heroes, she condescends
to treat the familiar objects of domestic life, and does it with an
ease of which her great writers, notably Plato and Aristophanes,
had also found the secret, when they passed from epic tragedy
to comedy, from the noblest eloquence to hearty expressions of
enjoyment.
These little statues interest the historian for other reasons also.
They sometimes give him, as at Tanagra, the most precise and
accurate information as to dress and social customs : sometimes,
as at Tegaea, they afford particulars of a famous though obscure
form of worship, of a divinity and of rites which are but im
perfectly described in the writings of classic authors.
This extension of knowledge and the great discoveries upon
which it was based, naturally led those who were interested in the
study of the remains of antique civilisation, to feel the necessity of
organisation, of division of labour, and of the importance of
ensuring a steady supply of the best and most trustworthy in
formation. Societies were therefore founded in many different
centres with the express object of meeting those wants. We can
not, of course, enumerate them here, nor attempt to estimate their
various claims to our gratitude, but we may be permitted to allude
to the good work accomplished, during fifty years of incessant
activity, by the Association which has perhaps done more than
any other for the progress of archaeology, we mean the Instihito
di Cot'rispondenza Archeologica, founded in Rome in 1829, by
Bunsen, Gerhard, and the Due de Luynes. Thanks to the
breadth of view which characterised its founders, this society has



Introduction. xix
been, ever since its inauguration, an international one in the best
sense of the word ; it brings together for a common end the most
eminent European savants and their best pupils ; it finds fellow
labourers and correspondents in every country. With their aid it
soon established a Bullettino, where, month by month, all discoveries
of interest made at any point of the Mediterranean basin were
registered ; and volumes, called sometimes Antiali, sometimes
Memorie, in which really important discoveries, and the problems
to which they give rise, were discussed. Some of these dissertations
are so elaborate and so full of valuable matter as to have formed
epochs in the history of science. They are accompanied by fine
plates, which, by their size, permit the reproduction of objects of
art on a grander scale, and with more fidelity, than had been
previously attempted.^
While the Roman Instituto was thus devoting itself to research,
and assuring to its members the advantages of a regular publicity,
these inquiries were daily attracting a more considerable share of
attention from the other learned bodies of Europe. The Acadc'mie
dcs hiscriptions et de Belles Lellres, the Academies of Berlin,
Munich, and Vienna, devoted an ever-increasing portion of their programmes to such studies. Men began everywhere to under
stand that the writings of the classic authors, which had been so
exhaustively studied ever since the Renaissance, were no longer
capable of affording fresh information. In order to learn more of
antiquity than the great scholars of the last three centuries, it was
necessary to penetrate into the past by paths as yet unexplored ;
it was necessary to complement and control the evidence of classic
authors by that of public and private inscriptions, engraved upon
bronze, marble, or stone ; it was above all necessary to seek for
the expression, in their handiwork, of the wants and ideas, of the
personal sentiments and religious conceptions, of the men of
antiquity. There are, in fact, nations, such as the Etruscans,
' For the history of the Instituto Archeologico, the notice written for the celebration, in 1879, of the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation, may be consulted.

whose whole literature has perished, who are only known to us by
the relics of their art. Others, like the Greeks and Latins, have
indeed transmitted to us noble masterpieces of literature ; but
these masterpieces are few in proportion to those which time
has destroyed. Of the thoughts which they expressed in their
immortal languages, too many have been lost for ever with
the fragile strips of papyrus to which they were confided.
With the ardour for knowledge and the heroic perseverance
which are among the virtues of our time, curiosity has refused to
resign itself to such a loss. It has determined to discover the un
published, to draw into the light all that has not perished beyond
recovery, to collect all that the spirit of antiquity has left behind it,
either upon works hitherto unnoticed, or upon those which have
been imperfectly understood. The treasures of epigraphy have
been classified and shown in their full value by Boeckh, Borghesi,
and others, and the world is now able to guess all that history may
owe to them. The study, however, of those remains which bear
figured representations is still more complex and formidable. The
language of forms is, in itself, less definite than that of words, and it becomes very difficult to decipher when we have no words
dealing with the same ideas to help us, when we possess the art
of a people without a line of their literature. Another difficulty
springs from the very abundance and variety of the materials to
our hand. We feel oppressed by the ever-growing accumulation
of facts, and can neither determine where to begin our work, nor
how to leave it off : we cannot see the forest for the trees !
II.
In 1830, when the Roman Institute was founded, the time
seemed to have come for the formulation of all the gathered
facts and for their arrangement into groups, a task which had become much more difficult than in the time of Winckelmann.
To conduct it to a successful conclusion a rare combination of
faculties was required ; breadth of intellect, aided by vast reading
and a powerful memory ; a philosophical spirit, capable of wide
generalisation, joined to that passion for accurate detail which
distinguishes the philologist ; it demanded one whose taste would



Introduction. xxi
survive the trying labour of the cabinet, a savant and an artist
combined in one person. Books do not teach everything. He
who wishes to speak of art with intelhgence must study art
objects themselves, must cultivate an intimate acquaintance with
them, and, within himself, a love for beautiful forms. Without the perceptive powers which such an educational process alone can
give, no man can appreciate the subtle differences which dis
tinguish styles and schools. He who possesses no ear, who is
unable to perceive the intervals which separate one note from
another, who knows that he can neither recognise nor remember
an air, does not, unless he be both presumptuous and ignorant,
dilate upon music, or attempt to write its history. In the art of
design, as in music, no education can supply the place of natural
aptitudes ; but the latter are not by themselves sufficient to form
a connoisseur. Something more is necessary to those who wish to form judgments upon which reliance may be placed, and to give
reasons for them which will bear discussion. A special prepara
tion must be undergone, the rules and technical processes—that
is to say, the language of art—must be learnt. A connoisseur
need not be able to compose an opera, or to chisel a statue,
but he should be able to read a part, or to decide, for instance,
by the appearance of a copy whether its original were of bronze
or marble.
At the end of the last century there was born in Silesia a man
who, while yet in his first youth, gave evidence of a rare combina
tion of the gifts necessary for the successful accomplishment of
the task which we have described ; we mean Carl Ottfried Miiller,
who has been called, without any exaggeration, a " scholar of
genius."^ A disciple of Niebuhr and Bceckh, he excelled all his
contemporaries in his efforts to embrace the whole of antiquity in
one view, to trace out and realise for himself all the varied aspects
of ancient civilisation. As a philologist, he took the greatest
pleasure in the science which weighs words and syllables, which
collates manuscripts. A poet in his hours of leisure, he appre
ciated both ancient and modern works of literature. As a young
man he studied with passion the antiques in the Dresden Museum
and the gallery of casts belonging to the University of Gottingen.
' Leo JouEERT, £'«<z/5(/i'«7V/^/cc<'/rf7//j'/(7//r (Paris, Firmin-Didot, i vol. 1863, p. 4).
We shall never cease to regret that politics have deprived literature of this judicious
and widely instructed critic.



xxii Introduction.
In the last year of his life he traversed Italy and Sicily with
continual delight, and was like one intoxicated with the beauty of
that Athens of which he caught but a glimpse, of that Greece
whose sun so quickly destroyed him.
All this knowledge, all these experiences he hoped to make use
of as the lines and colours for the great picture of ancient Greece
which he meditated, for the canvas upon which he meant to portray
the Greek civilization for the benefit of the moderns, with all its
indivisible unity of social and political life, of literary and artistic
production. In striking him down in his forty-second year, death
put an end to this project, and the great picture, which would
have been, perhaps, one of the capital works of our century, was
never executed. But the preparatory sketches of the master
happily remain to us. While he was employed in collecting
materials for the work which he meant to be his highest title
to honour, he was not shut up in silence and meditation, as a
less prolific spirit might have been. His facility of arrange
ment and utterance was prodigious ; all that he learnt, all new
discoveries that he made or thought he had made, he hastened to make public, either by direct addresses to the auditors who
crowded round his chair at Gottingen, or by his pen to the readers
of the numerous philosophical periodicals to which he contributed.
Like a man who has travelled much and who loves to tell of
what he has seen, he was ever ready to take the public into his confidence when he embarked upon a new study. This he gene
rally did by means of papers full of facts and ideas, written
sometimes in German, sometimes in Latin. In his later years
he issued short articles upon archaeology and the history of art,
in sufficient number to form five substantial volumes.^ Besides
this, he gave to the world learned editions of Varro, of Festus, of the Eumcnides of yEschylus ; or important monographs like his
Geschichten hellcnischer Stdmme tiiid Stddtc, including Orchomenos und die Minycr and Die Doricr, the most famous and most
actively discussed of his works ; and finally. Die Etrusker, a work which was suggested to him by one of the publications of the Berlin Academy. There was also Prolegomena zu einer wissen
schaftlichen MytJiologie, which has been fruitful for good even in
its errors, and the GescJiichte der griechischen Literatur, &c., which,

incomplete as it is, has never become obsolete. Since the time
of Ottfried Muller several other critics have attempted to rival
his achievements, but they have all lacked his breadth of view
and comprehensiveness of exposition, as well as the versatility
with which he combined the most accurate scientific investigations
v/ith a delicate appreciation of the beauty and originality of the
Greek authors.
But of all these works, that which has perhaps rendered the
greatest service to the science of archaeology is the Handbitch der
Arc/i^ologie dcr Kitnsf, which w'ds published in Breslau in 1830.^
Translated into French, Italian, and English, it at once took its
place as the indispensable guide for all those who wished to learn
something of antique art.- In all the universities into which
archaeology had made good its entrance, this manual has formed
the basis of the teaching, and also has enabled the pupils to
supplement for themselves the lessons which they learnt from
their professors. Even now it has not been superseded, and to
all appearance it will long preserve its supremacy.
The form of a handbitch or manual, which Ottfried Muller
gave to his work, was well and favourably known to cultivated
Germans, but it was not so with the French. They had nothing
of the kind but worthless epitomes made to facilitate the passing
of University examinations. In this matter the Germans are
better off than any other nation in Europe. They have manuals
in which every branch of history and science is treated by com
petent writers with as much care and skill as the most ambitious
publications, a few being original works by savants of the first
order. The arrangement of the Handbuch is very simple. It
opens with an introduction in which the author defines art — more
especially the plastic arts —divides it into classes, and indicates the
principal works to be consulted, namely, those to which he himself
has had continually to refer during the progress of his book.
Then comes the history of Greek and Roman art divided into

It appeared in 1841, so that the translator was unable to make use of the additions and corrections with which Welcker enriched the edition of 1848. But M. Nicard's edition has one great advantage over the German versions in the complete tables with which it is provided. The best English translation is that by J. I.eitch, the
second edition of which appeared in 1850. — En.

periods, and the paragraphs which are devoted to Etruria and
the East. To this historical epitome succeed the theoretical
chapters.
He takes antique art as a whole, and studies its constitution,
the materials and processes which it employs, the conditions under
which it works, the characteristics which it gives to form, the
subjects of which it treats, and the partition of its remains over the
whole territory occupied by ancient civilization. Greece, in her best
days, gave most of its care to the representation of those beings,
superior to humanity and yet clothed with human forms, in which
her glowing imagination personified the forces and eternal laws of
nature and of the moral world ; it was in striving to create
these types, and to endow them with outward features worthy of
their majesty, that Grecian art produced its noblest and most ideal
works. It will, therefore, be seen that a comprehensive manual
had to include a history of those gods and heroes which, with
that of their statues, formed a whole mythology of art ; and
this mythology occupies the larger portion of the second part
of the work.
This plan has been often criticised, but we need here make no
attempt to repel or even to discuss the objectit)ns which have been
brought against it.
It has doubtless the inconvenience of leading to frequent
repetition ; monuments which have been necessarily described and
estimated in the historical division are again mentioned in the
chapters which treat of theory ; but a better plan has yet to be
found, one which will enable us to avoid such repetitions without
any important sacrifice. The chief thing in a work of the kind is
to be clear and complete, merits which the Handbuch possesses in
the highest degree. Things are easily found in it, and, by a
powerful effort of criticism, the author has succeeded in classifying
and condensing into a single convenient volume, all the interesting
discoveries of several generations of archaeologists. Not that it
is a mere compilation, for previous writers were far from being
unanimous as to the dates and significance of the remains which
they had described, and it was necessary to choose between their
different hypotheses, and sometimes to reject them all. In such cases Muller shows great judgment, and very often the opinion
to which he finally commits himself had been previously un
known. Without entering into any long discussion he sustains it



Introduction. xxv
by a few shortly stated reasons, which are generally conclusive.
The plan of his book prevents him from launching out, like
Winckelmann, into enthusiastic periods ; he makes no attempt at
those, brilliant descriptions which in our day seem a little over
coloured ; but in the very brevity of his judgments and his laconic
but significant phraseology, we perceive a sincere and individual
emotion, an independent intellect^ a pure though catholic taste.
We need say no more to the objectors who attack the mere form
of the book. Its one real defect is that it was written thirty or
forty years too soon. The second edition, carefully revised and
largely augmented, appeared in 1835 ; it was the last issued during
the lifetime of M idler. From that moment down to the day but
lately passed when the excavations at Olympia and Pergamus were brought to an end, many superb remains of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman art have risen from their temporary graves and ranged themselves in our museums. If, however, recent archaeology had
made no further discoveries, a few occasional corrections and
additions, at intervals of ten or fifteen years, would have sufficed
to prevent the manual from becoming obsolete. With a little care
any intelligent editor could have satisfactorily performed what was
wanted. For the Grseco-Roman period especially Muller had
erected so complete a historical framework that the new discoveries
could find their places in it without any difficulty. W^elcker,
indeed, published a third edition in 1848, corrected and completed,
partly from the manuscript notes left by the author in his inter
leaved copy, partly from information extracted by the editor from
the lectures and other writings of Muller. But why does Welcker
declare, in his advertisement to the reader, that but for the respect
due to a work which had become classic, he would have modified it much more than he had dared. And why, for more than
thirty years, has his example found no imitators ? Why have
we been content to reprint word for word the text of that
third edition ? A few years ago one of the most eminent of our modern
archaeologists, Carl Bernhard Stark, was requested by a firm of
publishers to undertake a new revision of the Handbuch. Why
then, after having brought his materials together, did he find it
more useful, and even easier, to compose an original work, a new
manual which should fulfil the same requirements on a system of
his own devising ?—an enterprise which he would have brought to

a successful conclusion had not death interrupted him after the
publication of the first part.^ The answer is easy. The East was not discovered till after the
death of Ottfried IMuller. By the East we mean that part of
Africa and Asia which is bordered by the Mediterranean, or is so
near to that sea that constant communication was kept up with its
shores ; we mean Egypt, Syrian Phoenicia, and its great colony on
the Libyan Coast, Chaldsea and Assyria, Asia Minor, and those islands of Cyprus and Rhodes which were so long dependent upon
the empires on the neighbouring continents. It was between 1820 and 1830 that the young savant conceived the ideas which he
developed in his works ; it was then that he first took an important
part in the discussion as to the origin of the Greek nation, upon
which archseologists had long been engaged. What part had
foreign example taken in the birth and development of the religion,
the arts, the poetry, and the philosophy of Greece, of the whole
Hellenic civilization ? How much of it was due to suggestions derived from those peoples who had so long preceded the Greeks
in the ways of civil life ? No historian has answered this question
in a more feeble and narrow spirit than Ottfried Miiller; no one
has been more obstinate than he in insisting upon the originality
of the Greek genius, and in believing that the Greek race
extracted from its own inner consciousness all that has made its
greatness and glory. When Miiller first attacked this question, Egypt alone had
begun to emerge from the obscurity which still enveloped the
ancient civilization of the East. It was not until three years after
his death, that Botta began to excavate the remains of Assyrian
art ; and nothing but the vaguest and most confused information
was to be had about the ruins in Chaldaea. Now, however, we
can follow the course of the Phoenician ships along the Mediter
ranean, from the Thracian Bosphorus to the pillars of Hercules. From the traces left by the commerce and the industries of the

The first 256 pages of the first volume were published in 1878 with the sub-title : Einleitender und grundlegenda- Ty/c// (Leipsic, Engelmann, 8vo). A second instalment appeared in i83o, by which the introduction was completed. The entire work, which will not be
continued, was to have formed three volumes. We explained its plan and made some remarks upon the part already published in the Raiie Critique of

Syrians and Carthaginians, we can estimate the duration of their
stay in each of the countries which they visited, and the amount of
influence which they exercised over the various peoples who were
tributary to them. Forty years ago this was impossible ; the
writings of ancient authors were our sole source of knowledge as
to the style and taste of Phoenician art, and the ideas which they
imparted were of necessity inexact and incomplete. Wherever
they passed the Phoenicians left behind them numbers of objects
manufactured by them for exportation, and these objects are now
eagerly collected, and the marks of the Sidonian and Carthaginian makers examined and classified, and thus we are enabled to
recognize and describe the industrial processes and the decorative motives, which were conveyed to the Greeks and to the races of
the Italian peninsula by the "watery highway" of the Mediter
ranean. Fifty years ago the land routes were as little known as
those by sea. The roads were undiscovered which traversed the
defiles of the Taurus and the high plateaux of Asia Minor, to
bring to the Greeks of Ionia and /Eolia, those same models, forms,
and even ideas, and it was still impossible to indicate their detours,
or to count their stages.
Leake had indeed described, as early as 182 1, the tombs of the Phrygian kings, one of whom bore that name of Midas to which
the Greeks attached so strange a legend ; ^ but he had sfiven no
drawings of them, and the work of Steuart,'"^ which did not appear
till 1842, was the first from which any definite knowledge of their
appearance could be obtained. Miiller knew nothing of the dis
coveries of Fellows, of Texier, or of Hamilton ; while he was
dying in Greece, they were exploring a far more difficult and
dangerous region. A few years afterwards they drew the attention
of European savants to the remains which they had discovered, dotted about over the country which extends from the shores of the yEg^ean to the furthest depths of Cappadocia, remains which
recall, both by their style and by their symbolic devices, the rock
sculptures of Upper Assyria. The Lycian remains, which give
evidence of a similar inspiration and are now in the British

xxviii Introduction.
Museum, were not transported to Europe until after Miiller's
death.
The clear intellect of Ottfried Miiller easily enabled him to
perceive the absurdity of attempting to explain the birth of Greek
art by direct borrowing from Egypt. He saw that the existing
remains in both countries emphatically negatived such a sup
position, but materials were wanting to him for a right judgment
of the intensity and duration of the influence under which the
Greeks of the heroic age worked for many centuries, influences
which came to them partly from the Phoenicians, the privileged
agents of intercourse between Egypt and the East, partly from
the people of Asia Minor, the Cappadocians, Lycians, Phrygians,
and Lydians, all pupils and followers of the Assyrians, whose
dependants they were for the time, and with whom they communicated by caravan routes. We may thus explain the ex
travagance of the hypothesis which Miiller advocated in all his
writings ; and, as the originality of the Greek intellect displayed
itself in the plastic arts much later than in poetry, the partial
falsity of his views and their incompleteness is much more obvious
and harmful in his handbook than in his history of Greek
literature.
In writing the life of any great man and attempting to account
for his actions, it is important to know where he was born, and
who were his parents ; to learn the circumstances of his education,
and the surroundings of his youth. The biographer who should
have no information on these points, or none but what was false,
would be likely to fall into serious mistakes and misapprehensions.
He would find great difficulty in explaining his hero's opinions and
the prejudices and sentiments by which he may have been influenced,
or he would give absurd explanations of them. Peculiarities of
character and eccentricities of idea would embarrass him, which,
had he but known the hereditary predisposition, the external cir
cumstances during infancy and adolescence, the whole course of
youthful study, of the man whose life he was describing, he might
easily have understood. It is the same with the history of a
people and of their highest intellectual manifestations, such as
their religion, arts, and literature.
It was not the fault of Ottfried Muller, it was that of the time
in which he lived, that he was deceived as to the true origin of
Greek art. The baneful effects of his mistake are evident in



Introduction. xxix
the very first pages of the historical section of his work, in
the chapters which he devotes to tlie archaic period. These
chapters are very unsatisfactory. Attempt, under their guidance
alone, to study the contents of one of those museum saloons
where the remains of Oriental art are placed side by side
with those from Etruria and primitive Greece ; at every step
you will notice resemblances of one kind or another, similarities
between the general aspects of figures, between the details of
forms and the choice of motives, as Avell as in the employ
ment of common symbols and attributes. These resemblances
will strike and even astonish you, and if you are asked how
they come to exist among clifterences which become ever more and
more marked in the succession of the centuries, you will know not
how to reply. In these archaic remains there are many traits for
which those who, like Ottfried Mtiller, begin with the history of
Greece, are unable to account. He wishes us to believe that
Greece in the beginning was alone in the world, that she owed all
her glory to the organic development of her unequalled genius,
which, he says, " displayed a more intimate combination than that
of any other Aryan nation of the life of sensibility with that of
intelligence, of external with internal life." He goes no further
back than the Greece described to us in the heroic poems ; he
never has recourse to such comparisons as we are now continually
making ; at most he lets fall at lengthy intervals a few words
which seem to imply that Oriental civilization may have had some
thing to do with the awakenincj of Greek thought and the directing
of her first endeavours. He never formally denies her indebtedness,
but he fails to perceive its vast importance, or to declare it with
that authoritative accent which never fails him in the expression
of those ideas which are dear to him, of those truths which he has
firmly grasped.
This tendency is to be seen even in the plan of his work.
There is nothing surprising in the fact that Miiller, in 1830, or
even in 1835, had but a slight acquaintance with the art of the
Eastern Empires ; but as he thought it necessary not entirely
to ignore those peoples in a book which pretended to treat of
antiquity as a whole, it would perhaps have been better not to
have relegated them to a few paragraphs at the end of his his
torical section. He knew well enough that the Egyptians, the
Babylonians, the Phoenicians, even the Phrygians and the Lydians



XXX Introduction.
were much older than the Greeks ; why should he have postponed
their history to that of the decline and fall of Grceco-Roman art ?
Would it not have been better to put the little he had to tell us in
its proper place, at the beginning of his book ?
This curious prejudice makes the study of a whole series of im
portant works more difficult and less fruitful. It prevents him
from grasping the true origin of many decorative forms which, coming originally from the East, were adopted by the Greeks and
carried to perfection by their unerring taste, were perpetuated in
classic art, and thence transferred to that of modern times ; and
this, bad though it is, is not the worst result of Muller's misappre
hension. His inversion of the true chronological order makes a
violent break in the continuity of the phenomena and obscures
their mutual relations. There is no sequence in a story so broken
up, falsified, and turned back upon itself. You will there seek in
vain for that which we mean to strive after in this present history
of antique art—a regular and uninterrupted development, which in
spite of a few more or less brusque oscillations and periods of
apparent sterility, carried the civilization of the East into the
West, setting up as its principal and successive centres, Memphis,
Thebes, Babylon, Nineveh, Sidon, Carthage, Miletus and the
cities of Ionia, Corinth and Athens, Ale.xandria, Antioch, Pergamus,
and finally Rome, the disciple and heir of Greece.
Ottfried Mliller saw clearly enough the long and intimate
connection between Greece and Rome, but he did not compre
hend—and perhaps in the then state of knowledge it was impossible
that he should comprehend—that the bonds were no less close
which bound the Hellenic civilization to the far more ancient
system which was born upon the banks of the Nile, and crept up
the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, to spread itself over the
plains of Iran on the one hand and of Asia Minor on the other;
while the Phoenicians carried it, with the alphabet which they had
invented and the forms of their own worship of Astarte, over the
whole basin of the Mediterranean. His error lay in his arbitrary
isolation of Greece, in dragging her from the soil in which her roots were deeply imbedded, from which she had drawn her first nourishment and the primary elements of that varied and luxuriant
vegetation which, in due time, became covered with the fairest
hues of art and poetry.



Introduction. xxxi
III.
Thanks to the numerous discoveries of the last fifty years, and
to the comparisons which they have suggested, thanks al.so to the
theories for which they afford a basis, history has been at last
enabled to render justice to certain nations whose activity had
never before been properly understood, to give to them their
proper place in the civilization of ancient times. But Greece—the
Greece which Ottfried Miiller worshipped, and for which he was
too ready to sacrifice her predecessors and teachers, to whom she
herself was more just in her early legends— has lost nothing by
the more exact information which is now at our command. Served by her situation on the confines of Europe and Asia and
not far from Africa, by the superiority of the genius of her people
and the marvellous aptitudes of her language, Greece was able to
arrange and classify previous discoveries and to bring them to
perfection, to protect from destruction and oblivion the machinery
of progress, the processes of art, the newly-born scientific methods,
in a word, all the complex and fragile apparatus of civilization
which was so often threatened with final destruction, and which
has more than once been overwhelmed for a time in epochs of
national conflict and social decadence.
This is not the place for insistence upon all that Greece has
accomplished in the domains of pure thought, philosophy, and
science, nor even for calling attention to her literature. We are
writing the history of the arts and not that of letters, a history
which we wish to conduct to the point where Muller left off, to
the commencement of those centuries which are called the Middle
Ages ; and Greece will occupy by far the most important place in
our work. We shall endeavour to bring the same care and con
science, the same striving after accuracy, into every division of our history ; but the monuments of Greece will be examined and
described in much greater detail than those of Egypt and Assyria,
or even those of Etruria and Latium. It was our love for Greece that drove us to this undertaking ; we desire and hope to make
her life better known, to show a side of it which is not to be found
in the works of her great writers, to give to our readers new and
better reasons for loving and admiring her than they have had

before. A combination of circumstances that is unique in the history of the world gave to the contemporaries of Pericles and
Alexander the power of approaching more nearly to perfection, in
their works of art, than men of any other race or any other epoch.
In no other place or time have ideas been so clearly and com
pletely interpreted by form ; in no other place or time have the
intellectual qualities been so closely wedded to a strong love for
beauty and a keen sensibility to it. It results from this that the
works of the Greek artists, mutilated by time and accident as
they are, serve as models and teachers for our painters and sculp
tors, a role which they will continue to fill until the end of time.
They form a school, not, as some have thought, to enable us to
dispense with nature, the indispensable and eternal master, but to
incite to such an ardent and intelligent study of her beauties, as
may lead to the creation of great works, works capable, like those
of the Greeks, of giving visible expression to the highest thoughts.
As the Greeks excelled all other nations in the width and depth
of their cesthetic sentiments ; as their architects, their sculptors,
and their painters, were superior both to their pupils and their
masters, to the orientals on the one hand, and the Etruscans and
the Latins on the other, we need feel no surprise at their central
and dominating position in the history of antique art. Other
national styles and artistic manifestations will pass before the eye
of the reader in their due order and succession ; they will all be
found interesting, because they show to us the continual struggle
of man against matter, and we shall endeavour to distinguish each
by its peculiar and essential characteristics, and to illustrate it by
the most striking remains which it has left behind. But each
style and nationality will for us have an importance in proportion
to the closeness of its connection with the art of Greece. In the
case of those oriental races which were the teachers of the Greeks,
we shall ask how much they contributed to the foundations of
Greek art and to its ultimate perfection ; in the case of the
ancient Italians, we shall endeavour to estimate and describe the
ability shown by them in apprehending the lessons of their
instructors, and the skill with which they drew from their teachers
a method for the expression of their own peculiar wants and
feelings and for the satisfaction of their own sesthetic desires.
The study of oriental art will really, therefore, be merely an
introduction to our historv as a whole, but an introduction which



Introduction. xxxiii
is absolutely required by our plan of treatment, and which
will be comjsletely embodied in the work. The history of
Etruscan and Roman art will be its natural and necessary
epilogue.
This explanation will show how far, and for what reasons we
mean to separate ourselves from our illustrious predecessor. We
admit, as he did, we even proclaim with enthusiasm, the pre
eminence of Greece, the originality of its genius and the superiority
of its works of plastic art ; but we cannot follow him in his
arbitrary isolation of Greece, which he suspends, so to speak, in
air. Our age is the age of history ; it interests itself above all
others in the sequence of social phenomena and their organic
development, an evolution which Hegel explained by the laws of
thought. It would be more than absurd in these days to accept
Greek art as a thing self-created in its full perfection, without
attempting to discover and explain the slow and careful stages by
which it arrived at its apogee in the Athens of Pericles. In this
history of ours of which we are attempting to sketch the form, we
must, in order to get at the true origin of Greek art, penetrate far
beyond its apparent origin ; to describe the springing of Greek
civilization, we must first study the early history of those races
which surround the eastern basin of the Mediterranean,
The Greece which we call ancient entered late into history,
when civilization had already a long past behind it, a past of many
centuries. In this sense, the words which, as we are told by
Plato, a priest of Sais addressed to Solon, were perfectly true,
"You Greeks, you are but children!"^ In comparison with
Egypt, with Chaldaea, with Phoenicia, Greece is almost modern :
the age of Pericles is nearer to our day than to that which saw the
birth of Egyptian civilization.
Appearing thus lately upon the scene, when the genius of man
had, by efforts continued without intermission through a long
procession of centuries, arrived at the power of giving clear and
definite expression to his thoughts, by means either of articulate sounds and the symbols which represent them or by the aid of
plastic forms, the Greeks could only have remained ignorant of all
that had been achieved before their time if they had sprung into
existence in some distant and isolated corner of the world, or in
some inaccessible island. Their actual situation was a very
' TilllCEKS, p. 2 2.

xxxiv Introduction.
different one. In the earliest epoch of which we have any record we find them estabHshed in a peninsula, which is on one hand
upon the very borders of Asia, and upon another seems to hold out a hand to Africa by the innumerable islands which surround
its shores. Between the shores of this peninsula and those of
Asia, these islands are sprinkled so thickly over the narrow seas
that nature seems to have intended them for stepping-stones
Avhich should tempt the least venturesome to cross from one
continent to the other.
The Greek race thus found itself, by the accident of its
geographical situation, in contact with the Egyptian, Assyrian, and
Median empires, the masters of the Eastern Mediterranean ; while
the insular or peninsular character of most of the region which it
inhabited, together with the numerous colonies attached to the
surrounding coasts like vessels at anchor, had the effect of greatly
multiplying the points of contact. The Greek frontier was thus
one of abnormal extent, and was, moreover, always open, always
ready to receive foreign ideas and influences. Her eyes were
ever turned outwards ; the Greek nationality was not one of those
which remain for ages inaccessible to foreign merchandize and
modes of thought.
Such being the situation of Greece, it could not but happen, that,
as soon as the Greek race drew itself clear from primitive
barbarism, the fertile germs of art,—examples, models, processes,

should penetrate into the country from the neighbouring East by all the channels of communication which we have mentioned.
Seeing how far civilization had advanced, would it not have been
absurd for the Greeks to have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to
the experience of their predecessors ; to have begun again at the
beginning ? Was it not better to take up the work at the point
where it had been left, and to make use, for future developments,
of those w^hich had already been established .* INIan progresses as
fast as he can ; as soon as he learns any new method of satisfying
his wants and ameliorating his life, he makes use of it ; he makes
use of it at first in its original form, but with years and experience
he improves it and brings it nearer to perfection.
Thus then, the more we study the past, the more surely do we
recognize the truth contained in those myths and traditions which
betray the influence exercised upon Greece by the people of
Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor. To confine ourselves to the



Introduction. xxxv
plastic arts, the historian of Greek art discovers siirz'ivals, forms
and motives which had been employed in previous centuries and
earlier civilizations, in exact proportion to the accuracy of his
researches, and to the number of his elements for comparison.
He also finds that the Greeks borrowed from the same instructors
those industrial processes which, although not in themselves artistic,
are among the antecedent conditions of art ; namely, metallurgy,
ceramics, smith's work, glass-making, weaving, embroidery, stone
working and carving, in a word all those trades which seem so
simple when their secrets are known, but which, nevertheless, re
present the accumulated efforts of countless unknown inventors.
It was not only the material outfit of civilization that the Greeks
borrowed from their predecessors ; they obtained, together with
that alphabet which represents the principal sounds of the voice by
a few special signs, another alphabet which has been happily named
the alphabet of art, certain necessary conventions, combinations
of line, ornaments, decorative forms, a crowd of plastic elements
which they had employed in the expression of their own ideas and
sentiments. Even after Greek art had reached perfection and was
in the fu-11 enjoyment of her own individuality, we still find traces
of these early borrowings. Sometimes it is a decorative motive,
like the sphinx, the griffin, the palm-leaf and many others, which,
invented on the banks of the Nile or the Tigris, were transported
to Greece and there preserved to be handed down to our modern
ornamentist. The nearer we get to the fountain head of Greek art,
the more we are struck with these resemblances, which are some
thing beyond mere coincidences. The deeper we penetrate into
what is called archaism, the more numerous do those features
become which are common to oriental, especially Assyrian, art, and
that of Greece. We find analogous methods of indicating the
human skeleton, of accenting its articulations, of representing the
drapery with which the forms are covered. Greek taste had not
yet so transformed the details of ornamentation as to prevent us
from recognizing the motives which commerce had brought for its
use over the waves of the ^Egean or the mountains of Asia Minor.
The marks of their origin are continually visible, and yet a prac
tised eye can perceive that the Greeks were never satisfied, like
the Phoenicians, with merely combining in various proportions
the materials furnished by the artisans of Egypt or Assyria
;
the facilities of such a soulless and indiscriminating eclecticism



xxxvi Introduction.
as that could not satisfy the ambitions of a race that already
possessed the poetry of Hesiod and Homer.
The art of Greece was profoundly original in the best sense of
the word. It was far superior to all that went before it ; it alone
deserved to become classic, that is, to furnish a body of rules
and laws capable of being transmitted by teaching. In what
does its superiority consist ? How does its originality show
itself, and how can its existence be explained ? These are the
questions which we propose to answer ; but in order to arrive
at a just conclusion we must begin with the study of those
nations to whom the Greeks went to school, and of whose art they
were the heirs and continuers. We should be unable to grasp
the exclusively Greek features of Greek art did we not begin
by defining the foreign elements which have taken their part
in the work, and that we can only do by going back to the civilizations in which they were produced ; we must endeavour
to penetrate into the spirit of those civilizations, to discover
whence they started and how far they progressed ; we must
first define their ideas of the beautiful, and then show, by well
chosen examples, by what means and with how great a measure
of success, they realised their own conception.
We undertake this long detour in order that we may arrive
in Greece instructed by all that we have learnt on the way, and prepared to understand and to judge ; but during the whole
voyage our eyes will be turned towards Greece, as those of the
traveller towards his long-desired goal. Our route will conduct
us from the shores of the Nile to those of the Euphrates and
Tigris, over the plains of Medea and Persia and Asia Minor to
the shores of Phoenicia, to Cyprus and Rhodes. But beyond the
obelisks and pyramids of Egypt, beyond the towers of Chaldsea
and the domes of Nineveh, the lofty colonnades of Persepolis,
the fortresses and rock-cut tombs of Phrygia and Lycia, beyond
the huge ramparts of the cities of Syria, we shall never cease to
perceive on the horizon the sacred rock of the Athenian acropolis ;
we shall see it before us, as our history of the past advances,
lifting into the azure sky the elegant severity of its marble
porticoes, the majesty of those pediments where live and breathe
the g-ods of Homer and Phidias.
When we have crossed the threshold of the Propylsea, and



Introduction. xxxvii
have visited the Parthenon, the Erectha:um, and the temple of
the Wingless Victory ; when we have seen all Greece become
covered with monuments of architecture and sculpture, which,
without rivalling those of Athens in purity of line or finesse of
execution, bear the impress of the same style and the same taste ; when we have seen Praxiteles and Scopas succeed to
Phidias and Polycletus, will it not cost us a struggle to quit
the scene of so many wonders and conclude our voyage ? If we leave the Athens of Cimon, of Pericles, and Lycurgus, for
the pompous capitals of the heirs of Alexander ; if we cross
the sea to visit Veil and Clusium, to describe the Etruscan
cemeteries with the fantastic magnificence of their decoration ;
if at last we find ourselves in imperial Rome, among its basilicas,
its baths, its amphitheatres, and all the sumptuous evidence of
its luxury, we shall now and again turn our eyes with regret to wHat we have left behind ; and, although we shall endeavour
to comprehend and to judge with the liberality and largeness of taste and sympathy which is the honour of contemporary criti
cism, we shall sometimes sigh for that ideal of pure and sovereign
beauty which we adored in Greece ; and shall feel, now and again,
the nostalgia of the exile.

In this sketch of our plan, w^e have reserved no place for the
art which is called prehistoric, the art of the caverns and the
lake dwellings. This omission may surprise some of our readers,
and we therefore beg to submit for their consideration the rea
sons which, after grave reflection, have induced us to refrain from
retracing the first steps of human industry, from describing
the first manifestations of the plastic instinct of mankind.
We are actuated by neither indifference nor disdain. We fully
appreciate the importance of such researches, and of the results
to which they have led. No sooner had it entered into the mind
of man to look for and collect the humble remains upon which so
many centuries had looked with indifference, than they were
found almost everywhere, thickly dispersed near the surface of the
earth, heaped among the bones of deer in the grottoes for which

men and animals had once contended, buried in peat marshes and
sandy shores, sometimes even sprinkled upon the surface of the
fields and country roads. Pieces of flint, bone, or horn, fashioned
into instruments of the chase, into fishhooks, and domestic
utensils ; shells, perforated teeth, amber balls which were once
strung upon necklaces and bracelets ; fragments of rough tissue
and of skin garments ; seeds and carbonized fruits ; earthen
vessels made by hand and dried in the sun or simply in the
open air. In some of the cave dwellings, bones and pieces
of horn have been found upon which the figures of animals are
carved with a truth and spirit which allow their species to be at
once and certainly recognized.
But none of these remains bear the slightest trace of a system
of signs for the transmission of ideas or recollections ; there is
nothiny which sug'g-ests writinq; ; and, more significant still, there
is a complete absence of metal. All this is evidence that the
remains in question belong to a very remote antiquity, to a period
much nearer the primitive barbarism than to the civilization of
Egypt and Chaldsea, to say nothing of that of Greece and Rome.
The comparative method, which has done so much for natural science, has also taken these remains in hand, has attempted to
classify them and to gain from them some notion of the life led by the early human families which manufactured them. These arms, tools, and instruments which have been recovered from the soil
of the old and cultivated nations of Europe, have been carefully
compared with similar objects still in use by the savage races
which people the far corners of the world. These comparisons
have enabled us to decide the former use of each of the objects
discovered. By collating the observations of the various travellers
who have visited the savage races in question, we have been
enabled to form for ourselves a probably truthful picture, so far
as it goes, of the life and social habits of those primitive Europeans who made use of similar tools and weapons. And that
is not all. The general character of those early periods being
established, further examination brought to light the local differ
ences which prevailed then as now. Thus the proneness to
plastic imitation seems to have been peculiar to a few tribes

althouo-h traces of this taste are found elsewhere, it is nowhere so marked as among those primitive cave-dwellers of Perigord
whom Christy and Edouard Lartet have so patiently studied.



Introduction. xxxix
By dint of careful classification and comparison, we have been
enabled to follow the march of progress through those countless centuries whose number will never be known to us, whose total
would, perhaps, oppress our imaginations if we knew it ; we have
been enabled to discover the slow steps by which mankind raised
itself from the earliest, almost shapeless, flint axe, found with the
bones of the mammoth in the quaternary alluvial deposits, to
the rich and varied equipment of " lacustrian civilization," as it
has sometimes been called. In this unlimited field, of which one
side at least must ever be lost in unfathomable obscurity, the main
divisions have been traced ; the stone age has been defined and
divided into the pahcolithic and neolithic epochs ; the age of
bronze followed, and then came the iron age. With the appear
ance of the former metal the tribes of northern and central
Europe established a connection with the civilized races which
surrounded the Mediterranean, and with iron we are in the full
classic period.
We can never be too grateful for the persevering labours of
those who have carried on these researches in every corner of
Europe ; their deserts are all the greater from the fact that
they could never count upon those agreeable surprises which
come now and then to reward e>vcavators on the sites of ancient
and historic cities. Their chances are small of finding- those
objects of art which, by their beauty and elegance, repay any amount of toil and expense. The remains which they bring
to light have little to say to our aesthetic perceptions ; they
repeat a {q.v! types with an extreme monotony ; but, on the
other hand, they carry our thoughts back to a point far nearer the
cradle of our race than the myths of early history or even the monumental remains of Egypt and Chalda^a. They cast some
slight illumination upon those distant ages of which humanity
has preserved no recollection. They people with unknown
multitudes those remote epochs into which scientific curiosity
had, but yesterday, no desire to penetrate. There can be in
all this no real question of chronology, but when from the sands
of Abbeville or the caverns of Perigord we dig up the first flint
implements or those fragments of bone, of ivory, of reindeer
horn, which have preserved to us the first attempts made by man
to copy the outlines of living beings, it takes us far beyond
those days of which our only knowledge comes from vague



xl Introduction.
tradition, and still farther beyond those centuries which saw the
first struggling dawn of history.
We have, then, decided not to embark upon these questions of
prehistoric art, because, as the title which we have chosen declares,
we propose to write a history, and the word history, when the
human race is in question, implies established relations between
certain groups of facts and certain portions of time, measured at
least with something approaching to probable truth.
We do not yet possess, probably we shall never possess, any
means of estimating even within five or six thousand years, the
actual duration of the stone age. From all analogies progress must
have been, in the beginning, exceedingly slow ; like that of a falling
body, the rapidity of industrial progress is continually accelerating.
This acceleration is not of course quite regular ; the phenomena of
social life are too complex, the forces at work are too numerous and
sometimes too contrary to allow us to express it by the mathema
tical formula which may be applied to movement in the physical
world ; but on the whole this law of constantly accelerated progress
holds good, as indeed maybe historically proved. So long as man
had to do without metals, each generation, in all probability, added
but little to the discoveries of that which preceded it ; most likely
after each happy effort many generations succeeded one another
without any further attempt to advance. Ever since they have
been under our observation, the savage races of the world have
been practically stationary except where European commerce has
profoundly modified the conditions of their lives. It is probable,
therefore, that more centuries rolled away between the first chipped flints and the well polished weapons which succeeded them than
between the latter and the earliest use of bronze. But we cannot
prove that it was so, nor satisfy those whom probability and a
specious hypothesis will not content. Where neither written evidence
nor oral tradition exist there can be little question of historic order.
The remains of the stone age are not calculated to dissipate the
silence which enshrouds those centuries. In the art of a civilized
people we find their successive modes of feeling and thought
interpreted by expressive forms ; we may even attempt under all
reserve to sketch their history with the sole aid of their plastic
remains. The chances of error would of course be numerous ; but
yet if all other materials had, unhappily, failed us, the attempt



Introduction. xli
would have been well worth making. The more ancient portions
of our prehistoric collections do not offer the same opportunities ;
they are too simple and too little varied. The primitive savage
who moulded matter to his will with great and painful difficulty,
could impress upon it nothing but those gross instincts which are common to man and beast ; we can discover nothing from his works,
beyond the means which he employed in his struggles with his
enemies, and in his never-ending effort to procure food for himself.
The word history cannot then be pronounced in connection with these remote periods, nor can their remains be looked upon in any
sense as works of art. Art commences for us with man's first attempts to impress upon matter some form which should be the
expression of a sentiment or of an idea. The want of skill shown
in these attempts is beside the question ; the mere desire on the part of the workman renders him an artist. The most hideous
and disgusting of those idols in stone or terra-cotta which are
found in the islands of the Greek Archipelago, at Mycenae and in
Boeotia, idols which represent, as we believe, the great goddess
mother whose worship the Phoenicians taught to the Greeks, are
works of art ; but we are unable to give that title to the axes
and arrowheads, the harpoons and fish-hooks, the knives, the pins,
the needles, the crowds of various utensils which we see in the
glass cases of a pre-historic museum ; all this, interesting though it
be to those who wish to study the history of labour, is nothing but
an industry, and a rudimentary industry, which is content with
supplying the simplest wants. It is not until we reach the sculp
tures of the cave-dwellinofs that we find the first oerms of artistic
effort, and in truth, man did not cut the figures of animals upon the
handles of his tools and upon those objects which have been called,
perhaps a little recklessly, batons of command, for any utilitarian
purpose ; it was to give himself pleasure, it was because he found
true aesthetic enjoyment in copying and interpreting living nature.
Art was born, we may acknowledge, with those first attempts at
the representation of life, and it might fairly be expected that our
history should commence with them, were it not that they offer
no sequence, no starting point for any continuous movement like
that which, beginning in Egypt and Chaldaea, was prosecuted in
Greece and led in time to such high developments ; even its
competent students confess that the art of the cave-men was an
isolated episode without fruition or consequence. Specimens of

this art are found at but a few points of the vast surface over
which the vestiges of primitive man are spread, and neither
in the neohthic age, nor even in that of bronze—both far in
advance in other ways of that of the cave-dwelHngs —does it
ever seem to have entered into the mind of man to copy the types
offered to him by the organic world, still less those of mankind,
which, however, had long before been roughly figured in one or two caves in the Dordogne.^
Towards the close of the prehistoric age the taste for ornament
becomes very marked, but that ornament is always of the kind
which we call geometric. Hardly a single decorative motive is
taken from the vegetable world. Like the rude efforts of the cave
men, this decoration proves that those by whom it was imagined
and who frequently employed it with such happy results, were not
contented with bare utility, but, so far as they could, sought after
beauty. A secret instinct worked in them and inspired them with
the desire to give some appearance of elegance to the objects which
they had in daily use. This geometrical style of decoration
prevailed all over central Europe until, in the first place, the movements of commerce with Greece and Etruria, and secondly the
Roman conquest, introduced the methods of classic art.
From what we have said, it will be seen that we could not have
passed over in silence this system of ornamentation ; but we .shall
again find it in our path when we come to treat of that pre
historic Greece which preceded by perhaps two or three centuries
the Greece of Homer. By the help of the discoveries which
have been lately made in the Troad, at Mycenae, and in other
ancient sites, we shall study the works produced by the ancestors
of the Greeks before they went to school to the nations of the
East. But even with the discoveries which carry us farthest back,
we only reach the end of the period in question, when maritime
commerce had already brought to the islands and the mainland of
Greece objects of Egyptian, Phcenician or Chaldaic manufacture,
but before those objects were sufficiently numerous or the relations
with those countries sufficiently intimate to produce any great
effect upon the habits of native workmen. Among the deposits to
which we have alluded, it is generally possible to distinguish those
works which are of foreign origin ; and such works excluded,

Introduction. xliii
it is easy to form a sufficiently accurate general idea of the art
practised by the forefathers of the historic Greeks—by the Pelas
gians, to use a conventional term. So long as it was left to its
own inspiration, Pelasgic art did not differ, in its general character
istics, from that of the various peoples spread over the continent of
Europe, and still practised for centuries after the dawn of Greek
civilization in the great plains to the north of the Alps and the
Danube. Its guiding spirit and its motives are similar. There is
the same richness, or rather the same poverty, the same combinations produced by a small number of never-changing linear
elements. One would say that from the shores of the great ocean
and the Baltic to those of the Mediterranean, all the workmen
laboured for the same masters. Struck by this resemblance, or
rather uniformity, one of the most eminent of German archaeo
logists, Herr Conze, has proposed that this kind of ornament shall
be called Indo-European ; he sees, in the universality of the
system, a feature common to all branches of the Aryan race, a
special characteristic which may serve to distinguish it from the
Semites.
Objections have been brought against this doctrine of which
Herr Conze himself has recognized the gravity ; by numerous
examples taken from the art of nations which do not belong to the
Aryan family, it has been shown that, human nature being the same everywhere, all those peoples whose development has been
normal, neither interrupted nor accelerated by external causes,
have, at some period of their lives, turned to the style in question
for the decoration of their weapons, of their earthenware, their
furniture, their apparel and' their personal ornaments. The less richly endowed among them would have stopped at that point
but for the example of their neighbours, who stirred them on to
new attempts and further progress ; others advanced without im
pulse from ether sources than their own instincts, they reproduced
vegetable and animal forms, and finally the human figure in all
its beauty and nobility. It was the same with letters. Among
the nations which have made a name in history how few there are
that possess a true literature, a poetry at once inspired and
critical ! All however, under one form or another, have a popular
poetry which is more or less varied and expressive.
The trace of this earliest spontaneous effort, of this first naive
product of the imagination, never entirely disappears in a literature



xliv Introduction.
which is Hfe-like and sincere ; it is found even in the most perfect
works of its classic period. In the same way the most advanced
and refined forms of art draw a part of their motives and effects
Irom geometrical decoration. This style therefore should be
studied both for its jarinciple and for the resources of which it
disposes, but as we shall have to notice it when we treat of Greece,
it seems to us better to adjourn till then any discussion of its
merits. Both in Greece and Italy approximate dates can be given
to the monuments which it ornaments, they can be placed in their
proper historical position, which is by no means the case with the
objects gleaned throughout central Europe.
There is another consideration of still greater importance ; the artistic remains of Greece form an almost unbroken series, from
the humble and timid attempts of nascent sculpture to the
brilliant masterpieces of Phidias and Polycletus, and show the steps
by which the artist succeeds in passing from one style to another,
from curves and interlacing lines, from all mere abstract combi
nations, to the imitation of nature, to the representation of bodies
which breathe, feel, and speak, which move and struggle. Else
where force has either been wanting for this development, or
evidence of the transition has escaped our researches. Nothing
can be much more imperfect or more conventional than the figures
which we find upon some of the painted vases from Mycenae and Cyprus,' upon which the workman's hand, accustomed to straight
lines and circles, or segments of circles, has succeeded in suggesting
by those means the figures of birds and fighting men. Nothing
could be farther from the subtlety and variety of the contours
presented by living organisms. But in spite of all this, art was born with the awakening of this desire to reproduce the beauty
and mobility of living forms. All that had preceded it was but
the vague murmuring of a wish which had not yet become self
conscious ; but, at last' the intellect divined the use to which it
might be put, and guessed at the part which might be played by
the plastic instincts with which it felt itself endowed. All the rest
depended upon natural gifts, upon time and circumstance ; the
march along the road of progress began, and although its rapidity
was intermittent, it was certain to arrive, if not always at the

production of masterpieces of divine beauty, at least at sufficient
competence in painting and modelling to transmit the types of a
race and the images of its gods to posterity.
The student of plastic art finds in the remains of prehistoric
times rather a tendency to the creation of art, than art itself; by
postponing our study of this tendency until we come to investigate
the origin of Greek and Italian art, we are enabled to avoid all ex
cursion beyond the limits implied by our title, beyond that which is
generally called antiquity. The conventional meaning of this word
embraces neither the primitive savages who chipped the first
flint, nor the cave-men, but it calls up before our eyes the brilliant
cities of northern Africa and hither- Asia, of Greece and Italy, with
which our school-days have made us familiar ; it reminds us of
those nations whose stories we learnt from the sacred and profane
authors whose works we read in our youth ; and our thoughts
revert to their grandiose monuments of architecture and sculpture,
to their masterpieces of poetry and eloquence, to those great
works of literature in which we took our first lessons in the art of
writing and speaking. Behind all these images and associations
the intelligence of an educated man tells him —and the discoveries
of science every day make the fact more certain —that in the ancient
as in the modern world, the nations which figure upon the stage of
history were not isolated ; they each had neighbours who in
fluenced them, or whom they influenced, by commerce or conquest ;
each also received something from its predecessors, and in turn
transmitted the results'of its labour to those which came after it ;
in a word, the work of civilization was continuous and universal.
The nations which, for three or four thousand years, w^ere grouped
round the basin of the Mediterranean, belonged to one historical
system ; to those who take a wide grasp of facts they are but the members and organs of one great body, in which the nervous
centres, the sources of life, of movement and of thought, slowly
gravitated with the effluxion of time from the east to the west, from Memphis and Babylon to Athens and Rome.
As for the populations which, long before the opening of this
period and during the whole of its duration, lived on the north of
the Danube, the Alps, and the Pyrenees, they do not belong to the
same system ; they were attached to it by the Roman conquest,
but at a very late period ; not long, indeed, before the triumph of
Christianity, the invasion of the barbarians, and the fall of the

empire, led to the dissolution of the antique system and the
substitution for it, after centuries of confusion and violence, of the
wider and more comprehensive civilization of modern Europe,
a civilization which was destined to cross every sea and to spread
itself over the whole surface of the globe. As soon as the
victories of the Roman legions, and the construction of the great
roads which united Rome with her most distant provinces, had
brought them into constant communication with the maritime
cities of the Mediterranean, these barbaric nations, who had
neither history, nor letters, nor expressive art, received them from
their conquerors, whose very language they all, or nearly all,
adopted ; and for all this they gave practically nothing in return.
Elsewhere, the old world had almost finished its task. It had
exhausted every form in which those ideas and beliefs could be
clothed which it had kept unchanged, or little changed, for mil
lenium after millenium. The old world employed such force and
vitality as remained to it in giving birth to the new, to that
religion which has led to the foundation of our modern social
and political systems. These also were to have their modes
of expression, rich and sonorous enough, but dominated by
analysis ; they were to have arts and literatures, which have given
expression to far more complex ideas than those of antiquity.
The Celts and Teutons, the Slavs and Scandinavians, all those
tribes which the Romans called barbarous, have, in spite of the
apparent poverty of their share, made an important contribution to
the civilization into which they plunged at so late a period, when
they did so much to provide a foundation for those modes of
thought and feeling which are only to be found in modern society.
These races do not belong, then, to what we call antiquity. They are separated from it by many things ; they have no history,
they have neither literary and scientific culture nor anything that
deserves the name of art. Hidden behind a thick curtain of moun
tains and forests, sprinkled over vast regions where no towns
existed, they remained in their isolation for thousands of years,
furnishing to civilization nothing but a few rough materials which
they themselves knew not how to use ; they took no part in the
work which, throughout those ages, was being prosecuted in the
great basin of the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, in that
accumulation of inventions and creations which, fixed and pre
served by writing and realized by art, form the common patrimony

of the most civilized portion of tlie human species. When, at a
late hour, these nations entered upon the scene, it was as disturbers
and destroyers, —and although they helped to found modern
society, they produced none of those elements left to us by
antiquity and preserved for us by that Rome in whose hands the
heritage of Greece was concentrated.
We have difterent, but equally valid, reasons for leaving that
which is called the far East—-India, China, and Japan— outside the
limit of our studies. Those rich and populous countries have,
doubtless, a civilization which stretches back nearly as far as that of
Egypt and Assyria, a civilization which has produced works both
of fine and of industrial art which in many respects equalled those
of the nations with which we are now occupied. In all those
countries there are buildings which impress by their mass and by
the marvellous delicacy of their ornamentation, sculptures of a
singular freedom and power, and decorative painting which charms
by its skilful use of brilliant colour as well as by the facility and
inventive fancy of its design. The representation of the human
figure has never reached the purity of line or nobility of expression
of a Greek statue, but, on the other hand, the science of decoration
has never been carried farther than by the wood-carvers, weavers
and embroiderers of Hindostan, and the potters of China and
Japan. These styles have their fanatical admirers who see nothing but
their brilliant qualities ; they have also their detractors, or at least
their severe judges, who are chiefly struck by their shortcomings,
but no one attempts to deny that each of those nations possesses an
art which is always original, and sometimes of great and rare power.
Why then, it may be asked, do we refuse to comprehend the more
ancient monuments of India and China, those which by their age
belong to the centuries with which we are concerned, in this work ?
Our motives may be easily divined. We might allege our incompetence for such an extended task, which would be enough to occupy several lives. But we have a



xlviii Introduction.
still more decisive reason. Neither Aryan India nor Turanian
China belongs to the antiquity which we have defined, and as for
Indo-China and Japan they are but annexes to those two great
nations ; religion, written characters, the industrial and plastic
arts—all came to them from one or the other of those two ereat
centres of civilization.
So far as China is concerned no doubt or hesitation is possible. Down almost to our own days China and its satellites had no deal
ings with the western group of nations. It is a human family which
has lived in voluntary isolation from the rest of its species. It is
separated from western mankind by the largest of the continents,
by deserts, by the highest mountains in the world, by seas once
impassable, finally, by that contempt and hatred of everything
foreign which such conditions of existence are calculated to engen
der. In the course of her long and laborious existence China has
invented many things. She was the first to discover several of
those instruments and processes which, in the hands of Europeans,
have, in a few centuries, changed the face of the world ; not only
did she fail to make good use of her inventions, she guarded them
so closely that the West had to invent them anew. We may cite
printing as an example ; nearly two hundred years before our era
the Chinese printed with blocks of wood. On the other hand, every
useful discovery made in the period and by the group of nations to
whom we mean to confine our attention, from the time of Menes
and Ourkham, the first historic kings of Egypt and Chaldaea, to the
latest of the Roman Emperors, has been turned to the profit of others
than its authors, and forms, so to speak, part of the public wealth.
A single alphabet, that which the Phoenicians extracted from one of
the forms of Egyptian writing, made the tour of the Mediterra
nean, and served all the nations of the ancient world in turn for
preserving their thoughts and the idiom of their language. A
system of numerals, of weights and measures, was invented in Babylon and travelled across western Asia to be adopted by the
Greeks, and, through the mediation of the Greek astronomers and
geographers, has given us the sexagesimal division which we still
employ for the partition of a circumference into degrees, minutes
and seconds.
From this point of view, then, there is a profound difference between Egypt or Chaldsea, and China. The most remote epochs
in the history of China do not belong to antiquity as we have



Introduction, xlix
defined the term. Without knowing it or wishing it, all those
nations included in our plan laboured for their neighbours and
for their successors. Read as a whole, their history proves to us
that they each played a part in the gradual elaboration of civilized
life which was absolutely necessary to the total result. But when
China is in question our impression is very different, our intellects
are quite equal to imagining what the world would have been like
had that Empire been absolutely destroyed centuries ago, with all
its art, literature, and material wealth. Rightly or Avrongly, we
should not expect such a catastrophe to have had any great effect
upon civilization ; we should have been the poorer by a few
beautiful plates and vases, and should have had to do without tea, and that would have been the sum of our loss.
The case of India is different. Less remote than China, bathed
by an ocean which bore the fleets of Egypt, Chaldsea, Persia, Greece and Rome, she was never beyond the reach of the western
nations. The Assyrians, the Persians, and the Greeks carried
their arms into the basin of the Indus, some portions of which were annexed for a time to those Empires which had their centre
in the valley of the Euphrates and stretched westwards as far as the
Mediterranean. There was a continuous comincr and ofoine of cara
vans across the plateau of Iran and the deserts which lie between it
and the oases of Bactriana, Aria, and Arachosia, and through the passes which lead down to what is now called the Punjab ; between
the ports of the Arabian and Persian gulfs and those of the lower
Indus and the Malabar coast, a continual commercial movement
went on which, though fluctuating with time, was nev'er entirely
interrupted. From the latter regions western Asia drew her
supplies of aromatic spices, of metals, of precious woods, of jewels,
and other treasures, all of which came mainly by the sea route.
All this, however, was but the supply of the raw material for
Egyptian, Assyrian, and Phoenician industries. There is no evi
dence that up to the very last days of antique civilization the
inhabitants of Hindostan with all their depths and originality of
thought ever exercised such influence upon their neighbours as
could have made itself felt as far as Greece. The grand lyric poetry
of the Yedas, the epics and dramas of the following epoch, the
religious and philosophical speculations, those learned grammatical
analyses which are now admired by philologists, all the rich and

1 Introduction.
brilliant intellectual development of a race akin to the Greeks and in many ways no less richly endowed, remained shut up in
that basin of the Ganges into which no stranger penetrated
until the time of the Mohammedan conquest. Neither Egyptians,
Arabs nor Phoenicians reached the true centres of Hindoo
civilization ; they merely visited those sea-board towns where the mixed population was more occupied with commerce than
with intellectual pursuits. The conquerors previous to Alexander
did no more than reach the gates of India and reconnoitre its
approaches, while Alexander himself failed to penetrate beyond
the vestibule.
Let us suppose that the career of the Macedonian hero had
not been cut short by the fatigues and terrors of his soldiers.
So far as we can judge from what Megasthenes tells us of
Palibothra, the capital of Kalacjoka, the most powerful sovereign in
the valley of the Ganges in the time of Seleucus Nicator, the Greeks
would not, even in that favoured region, have found buildings which
they could have studied with any profit, either for their plan,
construction, or decoration. Recent researches have proved
Meoasthenes to be an intelligent observer and an accurate
narrator, and he tells us that in the richest parts of the country the
Hindoos of his time had nothing better than wooden houses, or
huts of pise or rough concrete. The palace of the sovereign,
at Palibothra, impressed the traveller by its situation, its great
extent, and the richness of its apartments. It was built upon
an artificial, terraced mound, in the midst of a vast garden. It
was composed of a series of buildings surrounded by porticos,
which contained large reception halls separated from one another
by courtyards in which peacocks and tame panthers wandered
at will. The columns of the principal saloons were gilt. The
general aspect was very imposing. The arrangements seem to have had much in common with those of the Assyrian and
Persian palaces. But there was one capital distinction between
the two ; at Palibothra the residence of the sovereign, like those
of his subjects, was built of wood. With its commanding
position, and the fine masses of verdure with which it was surrounded, it must have produced a happy and picturesque
effect, but, after all, it was little more than a collection of
kiosques. Architecture, worthy of the name, began with the
employment of those solid and durable materials which defend

themselves against destruction by their weight and constructive
repose.
The other arts could not have been much more advanced.
Ignorant as they were of the working of stone for building,
these people can hardly have been sculptors, and as to their
painting, we have no information. There is, moreover, no
allusion to works of painting or sculpture in their epics and
dramas, there are none of those descriptions of pictures and
statues which, in the writings of the Greek poets and dramatists,
show us that the development of the plastic arts followed closely
upon that of poetry. This difference between the two races
may perhaps be exjDlained by the opposition between their
religions and, consequently, their poetry. In giving to their gods
the forms and features of men, the oldest of the Greek singers
sketched in advance the figures to be afterwards created by their
painters and sculptors. Homer furnished the sketch from which
Phidias took his type of the Olympian Jupiter. It was not so with the Vedic hymns. In them the persons of the gods had
neither consistence nor tangibility. They are distinguished now
by one set of qualities and again by another ; each of the immortals who sat down to the banquet on Olympus, had his
or her own personal physiognomy, described by poets and
interpreted by artists, but it was not so with the Hindoo deities.
The Hindoo genius had none of the Greek faculty for clear
and well-defined imagery ; it betrays a certain vagueness and
want of definition which is not to be combined with a complete
aptitude for the arts of design. It is the business of these arts
to render ideas by forms, and a well marked limit is the essence
of form, which is beautiful and expressive in proportion as its
contours are clearly and accurately drawn.
Indian art then, for the reasons which we have given, and others
which are unknown, was only in its cradle in the time of Alexander,
while the artists of Greece were in full possession of all their
powers ; they had already produced inimitable master-pieces in
each of the great divisions of art, and yet their creative force was
far from being exhausted. It was the age of Lysippus and
Apelles ; of those great architects who, in the temples of Asia
Minor, renewed the youth of the Ionic order by their bold and
ingenious innovations. Under such conditions, what would the
effect have been, had these two forms of civilization entered



Hi Introduction.
into close relations with each other ? In all probability the
result would have been similar to that which ensued when the
ancestors of the Greeks began to deal with the more civilized
Phoenicians and the people of Asia Minor. But in the case of the
Hindoos, as we have said, the disciples had a less, instead of a
o-reater, aptitude for the plastic arts than their teachers, and,
moreover, the contact between the two was never complete nor
was it of long duration. The only frontier upon which the inter
change of idea was frequent and continuous was the north-west,
which divided India from that Bactrian kingdom of which we
know little more than the mere names of its princes and the date
of its fall. But before the end of the second century B.C. this
outpost of Hellenism had fallen before the attacks of those
barbarians whom we call the Saci. In such an isolated position it
could not long hope to maintain itself, especially after the rise of
the Parthian monarchy had separated it from the empire of the
Seleucidae. Its existence must always have been precarious, and
the mere fact that it did not succumb until the year 136 B.C. is
enough to prove that several of its sovereigns must have been
remarkable men. Should their annals ever be discovered they
would probably form one of the strangest and most interesting
episodes in the history of the Greek race.
Through the obscurity in which all the details are enveloped we
can clearly perceive that those princes were men of taste. They
were, as was natural, attached to the literature and the arts which
reminded them of their superior origin and of that distant
fatherland with which year after year it became more difficult to
communicate. Athough they were obliged, in order to defend
themselves against so many enemies, to employ those mercenary
soldiers, Athenians, Thebans, Spartans and Cretans, which then
overran Asia, and to pay them dearly for their services, they also
called skilful artists to their court and kept them there at great
expense ; the beautiful coins which have preserved their images
down to our day are evidence of this, the decoration of their cities,
of their temples, and of their palaces must have been in keeping
with these ; everywhere no doubt were Corinthian and Ionic buildings, statues of the Greek gods and heroes mixed with those portraits and historic groups which had been multiplied by the
scholars of Lysippus, wall paintings, and perhaps some of those
easel pictures signed by famous masters, for which the heirs of



Introduction. liii
Alexander were such keen competitors. Artisans, who had
followed the Greek armies in their march towards the East with the
object of supplying the wants of any colonies which might be
established in those distant regions, reproduced upon their vases
and in their terra-cotta figures the motives of the painting, the
sculpture, and the architecture which they left behind ; goldsmiths,
jewellers and armourers cut, chased, and stamped them in metal.
And it was not only the Greek colonists who employed their skill.
Like the Scythian tribes among whom the Greek cities of the
Eu.xine were planted, the nations to the north of India were
astonished and delighted by the elegance of their ornament and the variety of its forms. They imported from Bactriana
these products of an art which was wanting to them, and soon set themselves, with the help perhaps of foreign artists settled
amonsf them, to imitate Grecian desio-n in the courts of the
Indian rajahs.
That this was so is proved by those coins which bear on their
reverse such Hindoo symbols as Siva with his bull, and on their
obverse Greek inscriptions, and by the remains of what is now called Grsco-Buddhic art, an art which seems to have flourished
in the upper valley of the Indus in the third or second century
before our era. These remains, formerly much neglected, are now
attracting much attention. They have been carefully studied and
described by Cunningham ^ ; Dr. Curtius has described them and
published reproductions of the most curious among them.- They
are found in the north of the Punjab upon a few ancient sites where excavations have been made. Some of them have been
transported to Europe in the collection of Dr. Leitner, while others
remain in the museums of Peshawur, Lahore, and Calcutta.^ In
those sacred buildings which have been examined the plan of the
Greek temple has not been adopted, but the isolated members of
Greek architecture and the most characteristic details of its ornament are everywhere made use of. It is the same with the
sculpture ; in the selection of types, in the arrangement of drapery,
in the design, there is the same mixture of Greek taste with that
of India, of elements borrowed from foreign, and those drawn from
' ArchcEological Survey of India, 3 vols. 1871-73. ^ ArchcBologisdu Zeitung, 1876, p. 90. Die Griechische Kunst in Indien. ^ The Louvre has lately acquired some curious examples of this art.



liv Introduction.
the national, beliefs. The helmeted Athene and Helios in his quadriga figure by the side of Buddha.
Traces of the same influence are to be found in a less marked
degree in other parts of India. Near the mouth of the Indus and
upon the Malabar coast, the native sculptors and architects were
able to obtain more than one useful suggestion, more than one
precious hint as to their technique, from the works of art brought
in the ships of maritime traders. It is even possible that Greek
workmen may thus have been introduced into seaport towns, and
there employed upon the decoration of palaces and temples.
However this may be it is incontestable that all the important
sacred edifices of that region, whether stone-built or carved in the
living rock, date from a period more recent than that of Alexander,
and that most of them show details which imply acquaintance with
Greek architectural forms and their imitation. We are thus on
all hands forced to this conclusion : that, in the domain of the plastic
arts, Greece owed nothing to India, with which she made acquaintance very late and at a period when she had no need to take
lessons from others. That, moreover, India had little or nothing
to give ; that her arts were not developed till after her early relations with Greece, and it would even seem that her first
stimulus was derived from the models which Greece put within
her reach.
From all this it will be seen that we need not go as far as China,
or even as the Punjab, in order to explain the origin of Greek art.
During the period with which we are concerned, China might as
well have been in the planet Saturn for all she had to do with the
ancient world, and we need refer to her no more, except now and
then perhaps for purposes of illustration. W'e cannot treat India
quite in the same fashion, because there were, as we have said,
certain points of contact and reciprocal influences at work between
her and the group of nations we are about to treat. But as Greece
borrowed nothing from India, at least in the matter of art, the
little which we shall have to say of the products of the Hindoos
will not be connected with our discussion of the origin of Greek
art. A curious though hardly an important episode in history, is
seen in the reaction by which the Greek genius, when arrived at
maturity, threw itself at the command of Alexander upon that East
from which it had received its first lessons.



Introduction. Iv
None of those philosophical discussions to which Ottfried
Muller and Stark thought it necessary to give so large a place
will be found in our introduction ; both of those authors devoted a
long chapter to the definition of art and its principal manifestations.
Stark went so far as to discuss, with much patience and ingenuity,
the definitions of art and of its essential forms which had been
given by previous writers. We shall attempt nothing of the
kind ; we have not undertaken a work of criticism or aesthetic
demonstration. We wish to build up the history of ancient
civilization through the study, description, and comparison of its
plastic remains.
Neither do we feel sure that, in such a question as this, definitions
do not lead to confusion rather than to clearness. When short,
they are vague and obscure, and only acquire precision through distinctions and developments which have to be discussed at
length ; and again they generally lead, on one hand or the other,
either to objections or reservations. 0?iinis dcfinitio in jure
periailosa, says an old maxim, which is certainly true in matters
of art. Why should we attempt, unless we are obliged, to define
terms which awake sufficiently clear and distinct ideas in all
cultivated minds .'' No satisfactory definition has ever been given
of the word architecture, and yet, when we use it, every one knows
what we mean. Architecture, sculpture, painting, each of these
sounds has a precise meaning for those to whom our work is
addressed, and we may say the same of certain other expressions,
such as industrial arts, decoration, style, historical painting, genre
painting, landscape painting, which will often be found in our
pages. We must refer those who want definitions of these
phrases to the Graniinaire dcs Arts du Dessin of M. Charles
Blanc and kindred works. It will suffice for us that these words
should be taken in the ordinary meaning which they bear in the
conversation of cultivated men. If our ideas of art and its
different branches diverge here and there from those which are
commonly received, those divergencies will become evident, and
will be discussed and justified to the best of our ability as the
work proceeds. But on all occasions we shall do our best to avoid
the abstract and pedantic terminology which makes Ottfried
Muller's first chapter so difficult to read.
We have now declared the aim of our work and the route which



Ivi Introduction.
we propose to follow. In order to increase our chances of success,
I have sought and obtained the collaboration of j\I. Charles
Chipiez, whose special knowledge is well calculated to neutralise
my own deficiencies. To his Histoire critique des Origines ct de
la Foi'niatioii des Ordrcs grecqiics, was awarded, in 1877, one of the
highest prizes of the Academie des Inscriptions, and in the Salons
of 1878 and 1879 he confirmed his double reputation as a skilful
draughtsman and a learned theorist ; his Essais de Restoration
d'uii Temple grecque hypHhre, et des tours a dtages^ de la Chaldde,
was much noticed and discussed by connoisseurs. It would not
be fitting, however, to praise it here. I must confine myself to
saying how fortunate I am in having obtained a help which I have
found more helpful, more single-minded, more complete, than I
had dared to hope for. In all that has to do with architecture,
I have not written a line until after consulting M. Chipiez upon all
technical points. He has also taken an active part in the revision of
the text of certain chapters. As for the plates and illustrations in
the text, we have together chosen the objects to be represented,
and M. Chipiez, as a professional man and able draughtsman, has
personally superintended the execution of the drawings. It
remains for me to explain the role which we have assigned to our
illustrations.
VI.
In the single edition of his great work which appeared during
his own lifetime, Winckelmann inserted but a small number of
illustrations, and those for ornament rather than for instruction. One
of his translators, M. Huber, tells us that their execution gave
great dissatisfaction to the author.^ In our days, on the other hand,
those who undertake a work of this kind make use of the great progress which has taken place in engraving and typography, to
insert numerous figures in their text, to which they offer an
indispensable and animated commentary. Without their help many descriptions and observations might remain unnecessarily
obscure and doubtful. When forms are to be defined and com.
pared, mere words, in whatever language spoken or written, can
never suffice.

Introduction. Ivii
With well chosen phrases we may awake the recollections
of others, and give renewed life to any impression which they
may have received from some striking natural phenomenon or
some fine work of art. Their imaginations will call up for a
moment some landscape, picture, or statue which has formerly
charmed them. But if we wish to explain the complicated plan of
some great building, its design and its proportions, the slightest
sketch will be of more use than the longest and most minute
descriptions. So it will, if we wish to make clear the character
istics which distinguish one style from another, the Assyrian from
the Egyptian, the archaic Greek style from that of the Phidian
epoch or of the decadence, an Ionic column from the Erechtheum
from one of the same order treated by a Roman architect.
Between the contour of a figure from a Memphite bas-relief and
that of one from Nineveh, what difference is there .'' A tenth of
an inch more or less, a slight difference in the sweep of a line in
order to mark more strongly the junction of the thigh and the
knee. If we placed three nude torsos side by side, one of the
si.xth century, another of the fifth century, and the third of the time
of Hadrian, a practised eye would at once assign its true date to
each, in accordance with the manner in which the skeleton was indicated under the fiesh, and the muscles drawn over it and
attached to it. Supposing that the same model had served all
three artists, it would show in the one case a lively sentiment of
form combined with some dryness and rigidity ; in another a
freer, larger, and more subtle treatment, and in the third a want
of vigour and firmness : but it would be difficult to give by words
a clear idea of what caused the difference. Between the contour
which satisfies us and that which does not there is hardly the
difference of a hair ; by leaning a little harder with the chisel the
aspect of the one surface might have been made identical with the
other. By its double astragali, by the fine chiselling of its
gorgerin, by the elegant curve which unites the two volutes, and
by the general delicacy of its ornament, a capital from the
Erechtheum is distinguished above a Roman Ionic capital ; it is
at once finer in design and richer in ornamentation : by the side
of it a capital from the theatre of Marcellus or the Coliseum would look mean and poor.
The whole history of art consists of the succession of subtle
changes like these, and it would be impossible to convey them to

the reader by the utmost precision of technical language or the
most brilliant and life-like descriptions. The best thing that
can be done is to make one's remarks in the presence of the
statues, pictures and buildings concerned. But it is rarely that
we find ourselves in such favourable conditions for teaching and
explaining our ideas. But, in default of the objects themselves,
we may at least give the most faithful images of them which can
be obtained, and that we shall attempt to do throughout the course
of this history.
We shall, then, give a large number of figures, in which absolute
accuracy and justice of proportion will be aimed at rather than
picturesque effects. It is not very long since, in collections of
drawings from antique remains, they were all presented under one
aspect, so far as the subtleties of style were concerned. The hand
of the engraver spread a technical uniformity over them all in
which differences of school and date disappeared, just as the
delicate carvings and coloured ornament of the middle asfes and
the renaissance, which gave to each building an individuality of its
own, were reduced to dull monotony by the undiscriminating
brush of the whitewasher. It seemed to the artist natural enough
to clothe the monuments of the past in the style of his own day

and it required much less care than would have been needed for
the successful expression of all the diversities of style in his models.
We have now, however, grown more exacting. We demand from
the draughtsman who pretends to interpret a work of art the same
devotion and the same self-sacrifice as from the writer who is
charged with the translation of a work of literature from one
language into another— we require him to forget himself, so that
we may say of him, as the Latin poet says of his Proteus :
" Omnia transformat sese in miracuia rerum."
We require him to change his style with every change of
subject, to copy the gesture, the accent, and even the faults of
his model ; to be Chinese in China, Greek in Greece, and Tuscan
when he takes us to Siena or Florence. But we have indicated
an ideal which is not often reached. Every one of us has his
preferences and natural affinities, every artist his own methods
and personal modes of thought. One will be conspicuous for his
interpretation of the nobility and purity of the antique, another for
his treatment of oriental art or of the elecrance of our eighteenth

century. But the mere enunciation of the principle is of vahie,
for a great effect follows the praise which those who treat their
model with scrupulous and intelligent respect are sure to obtain,
and the blame to which they who are less conscientious expose
themselves.
Fidelity in interpretation is, in fact, the honesty of the draughts
man ; it may become, if carried to a great height, his honour, and
even his glory. So far as we are concerned, we demand it from
all those who are associated with us in this task ; and, so far as
e.xistinof methods will allow, we shall see that we obtain it. Unless
our illustrations had that merit they would obscure the te.\t instead
of making it more comprehensible. Our readers would search in
vain for the features and characteristics to which we might call
their attention, and many of our remarks and theories would
become difficult to understand. We should be in the same
position as an incompetent barrister who has made a bad choice oi
witnesses ; witnesses who, when in the box, prove either to know
nothing or to know only facts which tell against the party who has
called them.
Our aim in choosing our illustrations will be to place before
our readers good reproductions of most of the objects which are
discussed in our text. We shall, of course, be unable to figure
everything that is of interest, but we can at least ensure that those
figures which we give shall each be interesting in some particular
or another. So far as possible, we shall select for illustration
such objects as have not previously been reproduced, or have been
ill reproduced, or have been figured in works which are difficult of
access. We shall sometimes, of course, find it necessary to
reproduce some famous statue or some building which is familiar
to most people ; but even then we shall endeavour to give
renewed interest to their beauties by displaying them under some
fresh aspect and by increased care in the delineation of their forms.
Views in perspective, of which we shall make frequent use, give
the general aspect of buildings with much greater truth and
completeness than a mere plan, or a picturesque sketch of ruinous
remains, or even than an elevation.
Most of the more important perspectives and restorations due to
the learned pencil of M. Chipiez will be given in plates separate
from the text, as well as the most curious or significant of the
works in sculpture or painting to which we shall have to refer.



Ix Introduction.
Some of these plates will be coloured. But the majority of our
illustrations will consist of engravings upon zinc and wood, which
will not, we hope, fall short of their more elaborate companions in
honesty and fidelity.
From the earliest Egyptian dynasties and from fabled Chaldaea
to imperial Rome, from the Pyramids and the Tower of Babel to
the Coliseum, from the Statue of Chephren and the bas-reliefs of
Shalmaneser III. to the busts of the Caesars, from the painted
decorations of the tomb of Ti, and the enamelled bricks of
Nineveh to the wall-paintings of Pompeii, we shall review in due
succession all the forms which the great nations of antiquity made
use of to express their beliefs, to give shape to their ideas, to
satisfy their instincts for luxury and their taste for beauty, to lodge
their p-ods and their kina^s, and to transmit their own likenesses
to posterity.
We propose to trace and explain the origin of, and to describe,
without eesthetic dissertations or excessive use of technical terms,
those processes which imply the practice of art ; the creation
and descent of forms ; the continual changes, sometimes slight and
sometimes great, which they underwent in passing from one
people to another, until, among the Greeks, they arrived at the
most happy and complete perfection which the world has seen.
We hope, too, by the judicious choice and careful execution of our
figures, to give a fair idea of this course of development even to
those artists who have neither time nor patience to follow our
criticisms and descriptions.
I conceived the plan of this history, of which the first instalment
is now submitted to the public, at the time when M. Wallon, who
is secretary to the Acaddmie des hiscriptions et Bclles-Lettres,
entrusted me with the inauguration, at the Sorbonne, of the
teaching of classic archceology. But before it could be realized
two conditions had to be fulfilled. I had to find an associate in
the work, a companion who would help me in the necessary labour
and study, and I found him among my auditors in those first
lectures at the Sorbonne. I had also to find a publisher who
would understand the wants of the public and of the critics in such
a matter. In this, too, I have succeeded, and I am free to
undertake a work which is, I hope, destined to carry far beyond
the narrow limits of a Parisian lecture room, the methods and

principal results of a science, which, having made good its claims to
the gratitude of mankind, is progressing with a step which becomes
daily more assured. The task is an arduous one, and the continual
discoveries which are reported from nearly every quarter of the
ancient world, make it heavier every day. As for my colleague
and m\'self, we have resisfned ourselves in advance to seeingf
omissions and defects pointed out even by the most benevolent
critics, but we are convinced that in spite of such imperfections as
it may contain, our work will do good service, and will cause one
of the aspects of ancient civilization to be better understood. This
conviction will sustain us through the labours which, perhaps with
some temerity, we have taken upon us. How far shall we be
allowed to conduct our history .'' That we cannot tell, but we may
v'enture to promise that it shall be the chief occupation and the
dearest study of all that remains to us of life and strength.

TO THE READER.
We have been in some doubt as to whetlier we should append a special bibliography to each section of this work, but after mature reflection we have decided
against it. We shall, of course, consider the art of each of the races of antiquity in less detail than if we had undertaken a monograph upon Egyptian, upon Assyrian, or upon Phoenician art ; but yet it is our ambition to neglect no source of information which is likely to be really valuable. From many of the books and papers which we. shall have to consult we may reproduce nothing but their titles, but we hope that
no important work will escape us altogether, and in every case we shall give references which may be easily verified. Under these circumstances a formal list of works would be a mere repetition of our notes and would only have the effect of giving a useless bulk to our volumes. Whenever our drawings have not been taken directly from the originals we have been careful to indicate the source from which we obtained them, and we have made a point of borrowing only from authors of undoubted authorit)'. Those illustrations which bear neither an artist's name nor the title of a book have been
engraved from photographs. As for the perspectives and restorations supplied by M. Chipiez, they are in every case founded upon the study and comparison of all
accessible documents ; but it would take too long to indicate in each of these drawings how much has been borrowed from special publications and how much has been founded upon photographic evidence. JNI. Chipiez has sometimes employed the ordinary perspective, sometimes that which is called axonometric
jierspective. The difference will be at once perceived.
Egyptologists may, perhaps, find mistakes in the hieroglyphs which occur in our
illustrations. These hieroglyphs have been as a rule exactly transcribed, but we
do not pretend to offer a collection of texts ; we have only reproduced these characters on account of their decorative value, and because without them we could
not have the general appearance of this or that monument. It will thus be seen
that our object is not aflected by a mistake or two in such matters.
We may here express our gratitude to all those who have interested themselves ill our enterprise and who have helped us to make our work complete. Our dear and lamented Mariette had promised us his most earnest help. During the winter that we passed in Egypt, while he still enjoyed some remains of strength and voice,
we obtained from his conversation and his letters some precious pieces of information. We have cited the works of M. Maspero on almost every page, and yet we



l.\iv To THE Reader.
have learnt more from his conversation than from his writings. Before his
departure for Egypt—whither he went to succeed Mariette— M. Maspero was our perpetual counsellor and referee ; whenever we were embarrassed we appealed to his well ordered, accurate, and unbiased knowledge. We are also deeply indebted to M. Pierret, the learned conservateur of the Louvre ; not only has he done everytliing to facilitate the work of our draughtsmen in the great museum, he has also helped us frequently with his advice and his accumulated knowledge. M. Arthur Rhond has lent us a plan of the temple_ of the Sphinx, and M. Ernest
Desjardins a view of the interior of that building. The artists who have visited Egypt have helped us as cordially as the learned men who have deciphered its inscriptions. M. Gerome opened his portfolios and allowed
us to take three of those drawings, which express with such truthful precision the character of Egyptian landscape from them. M. Hector Leroux was as generous as M. Gerome, and if we have taken but one illustration from his sketch-books it is because the arrangements for this volume were complete before we had the chance of looking through them. M. Brune has allowed us to reproduce his plans of Karnak and Medinet-Abou. We have had occasion, in the work itself, to express our acknowledgments to MM. J. Bourgoin, G. Be'nedite, and Saint-Elme Gautier, who have drawn for us the principal monuments of the Boulak ar.d Lou\Te Museums. For the architecture we must name M. A. Gue'rin, a pupil of M. Chipiez, who prepared the drawings under the direction of his master, and M. Tomaszkievicz, whose light and skilful point has so well engraved them. If the process of engraving upon zinc has given
results which, as we hope, will satisfy our readers, much of the honour belongs to the untiring care of M. Comte, whose process has been employed ; all these plates have been reviewed and retouched by him with minute care. The steel engravings are by MM. Ramus, Hibon, Guillaumot pfere and Sulpis. In order that the polychromatic decoration of the Egyptians should be rendered with truth and precision in its refined tones and complicated line, we begged M. Sulpis to make
use of a process which had almost fallen into disuse from its difficulty and want
of rapidity; we mean that which is called aquatint. Our plates II., XIII.,
and XIV. will perhaps convince our readers that its results are superior to those
of chromo-lithography, which is now so widely employed.

A HISTORY OF
ART IN ANCIENT EGYPT
CHAPTER I.
THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION.
- v^ I. Egypt' s Place in tJic History of the ]]'orld.
Egypt is the eldest daughter of civilization. In undertakincr to
group the great nations of antiquity and to present them in their
proper order, in attempting to assign to each its due share in the
continuous and unremitting labour of progress until the birth of
Christianity, we have no alternative but to commence with the
country of the Pharaohs.
In studying the past of mankind, we have the choice of several points of view. We may attempt to determine the meaning and
value of the religious conceptions which succeeded one another
during that period, or we may give our attention rather to the
literature, the arts and the sciences, to those inventions which in time have done so much to emancipate mankind from natural trammels and to make him master of his destiny. One writer
will confine himself to a description of manners, and social and
political institutions ; another to the enumeration and explanation
of the various changes brought on by internal revolutions, by wars
and conquests ; to what Bossuet calls " la suite ties empires."
Finally, he who has the highest ambition of all will attempt to
unite all these various features into a single picture, so as to
show, as a whole, the creative activity of a race and the onward

movements of its orenius in the continual search for " the best." But in any case the commencement must be made with Egypt. It is Egypt that has preserved the earhest attempts of man
towards outward expression ; it is in Egypt that those
monuments e.xist which contain the first permanent manifestation
of thought by written characters or plastic ^ forms ; and it is in
Egypt that the historian of antique art will find the earliest
materials for study.
But, in the first place, we must give some account of the curious
conditions under which the people lived who constructed and ornamented so many imposing monuments. We must begin,
then, by describing the circumstances and the race characteristics
under which this early civilization was developed.
§ 2. The Valley of the Nile and its Inhabitants.
The first traveller in Egypt of which we have any record is
Herodotus ; he sums up, in an often quoted phrase, the impression
which that land of wonders made upon him : " Egypt," he says,
"is a present from the Nile."- The truth could not be better
expressed. " Had the equatorial rains not been compelled to win
for themselves a passage to the Mediterranean, a passage upon
which they deposited the mud which they had accumulated on their long journey, Egypt would not have existed. Egypt began
by being the bed of a torrent ; the soil was raised by slow degrees .... man appeared there when, by the slow accumu
lation of fertile earth, the country at last became equal to his
support . . . .
'^
Other rivers do no more than afford humidity for their
immediate borders, or, in very low-lying districts, for a certain
narrow stretch of country on each hand. When they overflow
their banks it is in a violent and irregular fashion, involving wide
spread ruin and destruction. Great floods are feared as public

misfortunes. It is very different with the Nile. Every year, at
a date which can be ahnost exactly foretold, it begins to rise
slowly and to spread gently over the land. It rises by degrees until
its surface is eight or nine metres above low-water mark ;
^ it then
begins to fall with the same tranquillity, but not until it has
deposited, upon the lands over which it has flowed, a thick layer
of fertile mud which can be turned over easily with the lightest
plough, and in which every seed will germinate, every plant
spring up with extraordinary vigour and rapidity.

Thus nature has greatly facilitated the labour of the Egyptian
agriculturist ; the river take- upon itself the irrigation of the
country for the whole width of its \'alley, and the preparation of
the soil for the autumnal seed-time ; it restores the virtue annually
taken out of the ground by the crops. Each year it brings with
it more fertility than can be exhausted in the twelve months, so

In order to flow over those banks it must rise to a height of some eleven or twelve metres, and unless it rises more than thirteen metres it will not have a proper eftect.

It contains 511 plates, partly coloured, and was published between the years 1833 and 1845. The drawings for the plates were made by members of the great scientific expedition of which Champollion was the head. Many of those drawings were from the pencil of Nestor L'Hote, one of those who have most sympathetically rendered the Egyptian monuments. 2 This advantage was thoroughly appreciated by the ancients. Diodorus Siculus, speaking of the Egyptians, says that "At the beginning of all things, the first men were born in Egypt, in consequence of the happy climate of the country and the physical properties of the Nile, whose waters, by their natural fertility and their power of producing various kinds of aliment, were welt fitted to nourish the first

and the chase are oppressed by care ; there are some days when
game is not to be found, and they die of hunger. Those who live
a pastoral life are also exposed to cruel hardships from the
destruction of their flocks and herds by those epidemics against
which even modern science sometimes struggles in vain. As
for agricultural populations, they are everywhere, except in
Egypt, at the mercy of the weather ; seasons which are either too
dry or too wet may reduce them to famine, for in those distant
times local famines were far more fatal than in these days, when facility of transport and elaborate commercial connections ensure
that where the demand is, thither the supply will be taken. In
Egypt the success of the crops varied with the height of the
Nile, but they never failed altogether. In bad years the peasant

beings who received the breath of Hfe. ... It is evident that from the foundation of the world Egypt was, of all countries, the most favourable to the generation of
men and women, by the excellent constitution of its soil " (i. 10). ' In all ages the rod has, in Egypt, played an important part in the collection of the ^taxes. In this connection M. Lieblein has quoted a passage from the wellknown letter from the chief guardian of the archives of Ameneman to the scribe Pentaour, in which he says : " The scribe of the port arrives at the station ; he collects the tax ; there are agents with rattans, and negroes with branches of palm ; they say ' Give us some corn ! ' and they are not to be repulsed. The peasant is bound and sent to the canal ; he is driven on with violence, his wife is bound in his
presence, his children are stripped ; as for his neighbours, they are far off and ar^; busy over their own harvest." (Les Rccits de Recolte dans rancienne Egyptc, comme Elements chronologique, in Recueil de Travaux relatifs a la FhiMo':;ie et a V Archiologie
ejyptiennes et assyrieiines, t. i. p. 149).



A History of Art in Ancient Ei.vit.
The first condition of civilization is a certain measure of security
for life. Now, thanks to the beneficent action of the king of
rivers, that condition was created sooner in Egypt than elsewhere.
In the valley of the Nile man found himself able, for the first
time, to calculate upon the forces of nature and to turn them
to his certain profit. It is easy then to understand that Egypt
saw the birth of the most ancient of those civilizations whose
plastic arts we propose to study.
Another favourable condition is to be found in the isolation of
the country. The tribes who setded there in centuries so remote
that they are beyond tradition and even calculation, could live
in peace, hidden as it were in a narrow valley and protected
on all sides, partly by deserts, partly by an impassable sea. It
Fig. 5. —The liastin.ado ; Beni-Hass.in. (Ch.iinpollion, pi. 390.
)
would perhaps be well to give some idea of the natural features
of their country before commencing our study of their art. The
terms, Loivcr-, Middle-, and U(^pcr-Egypt, the Delta, and
Ethiopia will continually recur in these pages, as also will the names of Tanis and Sais, Memphis and Heliopolis, Abydos
and Thebes, and of many other cities ; it is important therefore
that our readers should know exactly what is meant by each of
these time-honoured designations ; it is necessary that they should
at least be able to find upon the map those cities which by their
respective periods of supremacy represent the successive epochs
of Egyptian histor)-.
" Egypt is that country which, stretching from north to south,
occupies the north-east angle of Africa, or Libya as the ancients



The Valley of the Nile and its Inhabitants.
called it. It is joined to Asia by the isthmus of Suez. It is
bounded on the east by that isthmus and the Red Sea ; on the south by Nubia, the Ethiopia of the Greeks, which is traversed
by the Nile before its entrance into Egypt at the cataracts of
Syene ; on the west by the desert sprinkled here and there with
a few oases, and on the north by the Mediterranean. The desert
stretches as far north on the west of the country as the Red Sea
does on the east.
" It penetrates moreover far into the interior of Egypt itself.
Strictly speaking Egypt consists simply of that part of this corner
of Africa over which the n-aters of the Nile flow durinij the
inundation, to which may be added those districts to which the
water is carried by irrigation. All outside this zone is uninhabited,
and produces neither corn nor vegetables nor trees nor even grass.
No water is to be found there beyond a lew wells, all more or less
exposed to exhaustion in an ever-parching atmosphere. In Upper Egypt rain is an extremely rare phenomenon. Sand and rock
cover the whole country, except the actual valley of the Nile.
Up to the point where the river divides into several arms, that
is to say for more than three-quarters of the whole length of Egypt, this valley never exceeds an average width of more than
four or five leagues. In a kw districts it is even narrower than
this. For almost its whole length it is shut in between two
mountain chains, that on the east called the Arab, that on the
west the Libyan chain. Tht-se mountains, especially towards the
south, sometimes close in and form defiles. On the other hand, in
Middle Egypt the Libyan chain falls back and becomes lower,
allow'ing the passage of the canal which carries the fertilizing waters
into the Fayoum, the province in which the remains of the famous
reservoir which the Greek writers called Lake Mceris exist.
Egypt, which was little more than a glen higher up, here widens
out to a more imposing size. A little below Cairo, the present
capital of Egypt, situated not far from the site of ancient
Memphis, the Nile divides into two branches, one of which,
the Rosetta branch, turns to the north-west, the other, that ot
Damietta, to the north and north-east .... The ancients knew
five others which, since their time, have either been obliterated or
at least have become non-navirable .... All these branches
took their names from towns situated near their mouths. A large
number of less important watercourses threaded their way through



8 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Lower Egypt ; but as the earth there is marshy, their channels
have shifted greatly from age to age and still go on changing.
The Nile forms several lagunes near the sea, shut in by long
tono-ues of earth and sand, and communicating with the Mediterranean by openings here and there. The space comprised
between the two most distant branches of the river is called the
Delta, on account of its triangular form, which is similar to that of
a capital Greek delta (A)." ^ At one time the waves of the Mediterranean washed the foot of the sandy plateau which is now crowned by the Great
Pyramid ; the Nile flowed into the sea at that time slightly to
the north of the site upon which Memphis was afterwards built.
With the slow passage of time the particles of earth which it
brought down from the mountains of Abyssinia were deposited
as mud banks upon the coast, and gradually filling up the gulf,
created instead wide marshy plains intersected by lakes. Here
and there ancient sand ridges indicate the successive water
courses. The never-ceasing industry of its floods had already,
at the earliest historic period, carried the mouths of the Nile
far beyond the normal line of the neighbouring coasts. The
Egyptian priests—whose words have been preserved for us by
Herodotus—had a true idea as to how this vast plain had been
created, a plain which now comprises twenty-three thousand square
kilometres and is continually being added to ; but they were
strangely deceived when they thought and declared that Menes
or Mena, the first of all kings, found ahnost all Egypt under the
waters. The sea, they said, penetrated in those days beyond
the site of Memphis, and the remainder of the country, the
district of Thebes excepted, was an unhealthy morass.- The
Delta had, in fact, existed long before the appearance of Menes, and perhaps it may have shown pretty much its present form
when the Egyptian race first appeared in the valley of the Nile.^
As to the origin of that race, we need not enter at length
into a question so purely ethnographical. It is now generally
allowed that they were connected with the white races of Europe
1 RoBiou, Histoire anciaine dcs Pcuples de /' Orient^ cli. \. - Herodotus, ii. 4. * Maspero, Histoire ancienite dcs Peuples de f Orient, pp. 6 and 7. In such general explanations as are unavoidable -we shall content ourselves with paraphrasing M. Maspero.

and Western Asia ; the anatomical examination of the bodies
recovered from the most ancient tombs, and the study of their
statues, bas-rehefs, and pictures, all point to this conclusion. If
we take away individual peculiarities these monuments furnish
us with the following common type of the race even in the
most remote epochs :

" The average Egyptian was tall, thin, active. He had large
and powerful shoulders,^ a muscular chest, sinewy arms termi
nating in long and nervous hands, narrow hips, and thin muscular legs. His knees and calves were nervous and muscular, as is
generally the case with a pedestrian race ; his feet were long,
thin, and flattened, by his habit of going barefoot. The head,
often too large and powerful for the body, was mild, and even
sad in its expression. His forehead was square and perhaps a
little low, his nose short and round ; his eyes were large and well
opened, his cheeks full and round, his lips thick but not turned
out like a negro's ; his rather large mouth bore an habitually
soft and sorrowful expression. These features are to be found
in most of the statues of the ancient and middle empires, and
in all the later epochs. Even to the present day the peasants,
or fellahs, have almost everywhere preserved the physiognomj"
of their ancestors, although the ujDper classes have lost it by
repeated intermarriage with strangers." When Mariette discovered in the necropolis at Memphis the
famous wooden statue of a man standing and holding in his
hand the baton of authority, the peasants of Sakkarah recog
nised at once the feature and attitude of one of themselves,
of the rustic dignitary who managed the corvdcs and apportioned
the taxation. An astonished fellah cried out : " The Sheikh-el
Beled ! " His companions took up the cry, and the statue has
been known by that name ever since.'^
Increased knowledge of the Egyptian language has enabled us
to carry our researches much farther than Champollion and his
successors. By many of its roots, by its system of pronouns,
1 Their exceptional breadth of shoulder has been confirmed by an examination of the skeletons in the mummies. See on this subject a curious note in Bondmi's Some ObsciTal'wns on the Skeleton of an Egyptian Mumiuy ( Transactions of the Society of

by its nouns of number, and by some of the arrangements of
its conjugations, it seems to have been attached to the Semitic
family of languages. Some of the idioms of these Semitic
tongues are found in Egyptian in a rudimentary state. From
this it has been concluded
that Egyptian and its cognate
languages, after having belonged
to that group, separated from it
at a very early period, while their grammatical system was still in
course of formation. Thus, dis
united and subjected to diverse
influences, the two families made
a different use of the elements
which they possessed in common. There would thus seem to have been a community of root between the Egyptians on the one part and the Arabs, Hebrews,
and Phoenicians on the other,
but the separation took place at
such an early period, that the
tribes who came to establish
themselves in the valley of the
Nile had both the time and the
opportunity to acquire a very
particular and original physi
ognomy of their own. The
Egyptians are therefore said to
belong to the proto-Semitic
races.

M. Maspero.^ But other critics of equal authority are more
impressed by the differences than by the resemblances, which,
however, they neither deny nor explain. M. Renan prefers to
rank the Copts, the Tuaregs, and the Berbers in a family which
he would call Chamitic, and to which he would refer most of the idioms of Northern Africa. '-^ A comparison of the languages
is, then, insufficient to decide the question of origin.
The people whose physical characteristics we have described
and whose idiom we have defined, came from Asia, to all appear
ance, by the Isthmus of Suez. Perhaps they found established
on the banks of the Nile another race, probably black, and
indieenous to the African continent.^ If this were so the new
comers forced the earlier occupants of the country southwards
without mixing with them, and set themselves resolutely to the
work of improvement. Egypt must then have presented a very
different sight from its richness and fertility of to-day. The
river when left to itself, was perpetually changing its bed, and
even in its highest floods it failed to reach certain parts of the
valley, which remained unproductive ; in other districts it
remained so long that it changed the soil into swamp. The
Delta, half of it drowned in the waters of the Nile, the other
half under those of the Mediterranean, was simply a huge
morass dotted here and there with sandy islands and waving
with papyrus, reeds, and lotus, across which the river worked
its sluggish and uncertain way ; upon both banks the desert
swallowed up all the soil left untouched by the yearly inun
dations. From the crowding vegetation of a tropical marsh
to the most absolute aridity was but a step. Little by little
the new comers learnt to control the course of the floods, to
bank them in and to carry them to the farthest corners of the
valley, and Egypt gradually arose out of the waters and became
in the hand of man one of the best adapted countries in the
world for the development of a great civilization."*
How many generations did it require to create the country
and the nation ? We cannot tell. But we may affirm that a

commencement was made by the simultaneous establishment at
several different points of small independent states, each of which
had its own laws and its own form of worship. These districts remained almost unchanged in number and in their respective
boundaries almost up to the end of the ancient world. Their
union under one sceptre formed the kingdom of the Pharaohs,

the country of Khemi, but their primitive divisions did not there
fore disappear ; the small independent states became provinces
and were the foundation of those local administrative districts
which the Greeks called tnviics.
Besides this division into districts, the Egyptians had one
other, and only one— the di\ision into Lower Egypt, or the

North Country {Tomera, or To-incJi), and into Upper Egypt,
or the South Country {To-rcs). Lower Egypt consisted of the Delta ; Upper Egypt stretched from the southernmost point of
the Delta to the first cataract. This division has the advantage
of corresponding exactly to the configuration of the country ;
moreover, it preserves the memory of a period before the time
of Menes, during which Egypt was divided into two separate
kingdoms—that of the North and that of the South, a division
which in later times had often a decisive influence upon the
course of events. This state of things was of sufficiently long
duration to leave an ineffaceable trace upon the official language of
Egypt, and upon that which we may call its blazonry, or heraldic
imagery. The sovereigns who united the whole territory under

one sceptre are always called, in the royal protocols, the lords
of Upper and Low^er Eg}'pt ; they carry on their heads two
crowns, each appropriate to one of the two great divisions of their united kingdom. That of Upper Egypt is known to
Egyptologists as the white crown, because of the colour which
it bears upon painted monuments ; that of the North is called
the red crown, for a similar reason. Combined with one another
they form the complete regal head-dress ordinarily called the
pschent. In the hieroglyphics Northern Egypt is indicated b)the papyrus ; Southern by the lotus.

method of speech we should be under the continual necessity
of stopping the narration to define geographical positions ; but
with the tri-partite division we may speak of Beni-Hassan as in
Middle, and Abydos as in Upper Egypt, and thus give a
sufficient idea of their relative positions.
^ 3- The Great Divisions of Egyptian History.
In enumerating and analysing the remains of Egyptian art, we
shall classify them chronologically as well as locally. The
monuments of the plastic arts will be arranged into groups de
termined by the periods of their occurrence, as well as by their
geographical distribution. We must refer our readers to the works
of M. Maspero and others for the lists of kings and dynasties, and
for the chief events of each reign, but it will be convenient for us
to give here a summary of the principal epochs in Egyptian history.
Each of those epochs corresponds to an artistic period with a



The Great Divisions of Egyptian History. 17
special character and individuality of its own. The following
paragraphs taken from the history of M. Maspero give all the
necessary information in a brief form.
" In the last years of the prehistoric period, the sacerdotal class
had obtained a supremacy over the other classes of the nation. A man called Menes (Menha or Mena in the Egyptian texts) destroyed this supremacy and lounded the Egyptian monarchy.
" This monarchy existed for at least four thousand years, under
thirty consecutive dynasties, from the reign of Menes to that of
Nectanebo (340 years before our era). This interval of time, the
longest of which political history takes note, is usually divided into
three parts : the Ancient Empire, from the first to the eleventh
d)-nast)' ; the Middle Empire, from the eleventh dynasty to the invasion of the Hyksos or Shepherds ; the Nevj Empire from the
shepherd kings to the Persian conquest. This division is incon
venient in one respect ; it takes too little account of the sequence
of historical events.
" There were indeed, three great revolutions in the historical development of Egypt. At the beginning of its long succession
of human dynasties (the Egyptians, like other peoples, placed a
number of dynasties of divine rulers before their first human king)
tlie political centre of the country was at Memphis ; Memphis was
the capital and the burying-place of the kings ; Memphis imposed
sovereigns upon the rest of the country and was the chief market for Egyptian commerce and industry. With the commencement of
the sixth dynasty, the centre of gravity began to shift southwards.
During the ninth and tenth dynasties it rested at Heracleopolis,
in Middle Egypt, and in the time of the eleventh dynasty, it fixed
itself at Thebes. From that period onwards Thebes was the
capital of the country and furnished the sovereign. From the
eleventh to the twenty-first all the Egyptian dynasties were Theban
with the single exception of the fourteenth Xoite dynasty. At the
time of the shepherd invasion, the Thebaid became the citadel of
Egyptian nationality, and its princes, after centuries of war against
the intruders, finally succeeded in freeing the whole valley of the
Nile for the benefit of the eighteenth dynasty, which opened the
era of great foreign wars.
" Under the nineteenth dynasty an inverse movement to that
of the first period carried the political centre of the country back
towards the north. With the twenty-first Tanite dynasty, Thebes

ceased to be the capital, and the cities of the Delta, Tanis, Bubastis,
Mendes, Sebennytos, and above all Sais, rose into equal or superior
importance. From that time the political life of the country con
centrated itself in the maritime districts. The nomcs of the
Thebaid, ruined by the Ethiopian and Assyrian invasions, lost their
influence ; and Thebes itself fell into ruin and became nothing
more than a rcndezvojis for curious travellers.
" I propose, therefore, to divide Egyptian history into three
periods, each corresponding to the political supremacy of one town
or province over the whole of Egypt :

" First Period, Memphite (the first ten dynasties). The
supremacy of Memphis and of the sovereigns furnished by
her.
" Second Period, Theban (from the eleventh to the twentieth
dynasties inclusive). Supremacy of Thebes and the Theban kings. This period is divided into two sub-periods by the Shepherd
dynasties. ''a. The old Theban empire, from the eleventh to the sixteenth
dynasties.
'' b. The neio Theban empire, from the sixteenth to the twentieth
dynasties.
" Third Period, Salt (from the twenty-first to the thirtieth
dynasties, inclusive). Supremacy of Sais and the other cities of the
Delta. This period is divided into two by the Persian invasion :

" First Sail period, from the twenty-first to the twent)'-sixth
dynasties.
'' Second Sail period, horn the twenty-seventh to the thirtieth
dynasties." ^
Mariette places the accession of Mena or Menes at about the
fiftieth century before our era, while Bunsen and other Egyptologists
bring forward his date to 3,600 or 3,500 B.C. as they believe some of the dynasties of Manetho to have been contemporary with each
other. Neither Mariette nor Maspero deny that Egypt, in the
course of its long existence, was often partitioned between jDrinces
who reigned in Upper and Lower Egypt respectively; but, guided
^ Histoire ancicnne des Peuples dc r Orient, \^. <-,2,. We believe that the division proposed by M. Maspero is, in fact, the best. It is the most suggestive of the truth as to the successive displacements of the political centre and the movement of history. We .shall, however, have no hesitation in making use of the terms Aiicienf, Midille, and New Empire, as occasion arises.

by circumstances which need not be described here, they incline to
believe that INIanetho confined himself to enumerating those
dynasties which were looked upon as the legitimate ones. The work of elimination which has been attempted by certain modern
savaii/s, must have been undertaken, to a certain extent, in Egypt
itself; and some of the collateral dynasties must have been effaced
and passed over in silence, because the monuments still remaining
preserve the names of reigning families which are ignored by
history.
Whatever may be thought of this initial date, Egypt remains, as
has been so well said by JNI. Renan, " a lighthouse in the profourd
darkness of remote antiquity." Its period of greatest power was
long anterior to the earliest traditions of the Greek race ; the reign
of Thothmes III., who, according to a contemporary expression,
"drew his frontiers where he pleased," is placed by common con
sent in the seventeenth century, B.C. The Egyptian empire then
comprised Abyssinia, the Soudan, Nubia, Syria, Mesopotamia, part
of Arabia, Khurdistan, and Armenia. Eounded by the kings of
the eighteenth dynasty, this greatness was maintained by those of
the nineteenth. To this dynasty belonged Rameses II., the
Sesostris of the Greeks, who flourished in the fifteenth century. It
was the superiority of its civilization, even more than the valour of
its princes and soldiers, which made Egypt supreme over Western
Asia.
This supremacy declined during the twenty-first and twentysecond dynasties, but, at the same time, Egyptian chronology
becomes more certain as opportunities of comparison with the facts
of Hebrew history increase. The date of 980, within a year or
two, may be given with confidence as that of the accession of Sheshonk I., the contemporary of Solomon and Rehoboam. From
that date onwards, the constant struggles between Egypt and its
neighbours, especially with Assyria, multiply our opportunities for
synchronic comparison. In the seventh century the country was
opened to the Greeks, the real creators of history, who brought
with them their inquiring spirit and their love for exactitude.
After the accession of Psemethek I., the founder of the twenty
sixth dynasty, in 656, our historical materials are abundant. For
that we must thank the Greek travellers who penetrated every
where, taking notes which they afterwards amplified into narratives.
It is a singular thing, that even as late as the Ptolemies, when the

power of the Macedonian monarcliy was fully developed, the Egyptians never seem to have felt the want of what we call an
era, of some definite point from which they could measure the
course of time and the progress of the centuries. " They were
satisfied with calculating by the years of the reigning sovereign,
and even those calculations had no certain point of departure.
Sometimes they counted from the commencement of the year which
had witnessed the death of his predecessor, sometimes from the
day of his own coronation. The most careful calculations will
therefore fail to enable modern science to restore to the Egyptians
that which, in fact, they never possessed." ^
Even thus summarily stated, these historical indications are
enough to show how little foundation there is for the opinion which
was held by the ancient Greeks, and too long accepted by modern
historians. It was, they said, from Ethiopia that Egyptian
civilization had come. A colony of Ethiopian priests from the
island of Meroe in Upper Nubia, had introduced their religion,
their written characters, their art and their civil institutions into the
country. The exact opposite of this is the truth. "It was the Egyptians who advanced up the banks of the Nile to found cities,
fortresses, and temples in Ethiopia ; it was the Egyptians who
carried their civilization into the midst of savage negro tribes.
The error was caused by the fact that at one epoch in the history
of Egypt the Ethiopians played an important part.
" If it were true that Egypt owed its political existence to
Ethiopia, we should be able to find in the latter country monuments
of a more remote antiquity, and as we descended the Nile, we should find the remains comparatively modern ; but, strangely
enough, the study of all these monuments incontestably proves
that the sequence of towns, holy places, and tombs, constructed by
the Egyptians on the banks of their river, follow each other in
such chronological order that the oldest remains, the Pyramids,
are found in the north, in Lower Egypt, near the southern point
of the Delta. The nearer our steps take us to the cataracts of
Ethiopia, the less ancient do the monuments become. They show
ever increasing signs of the decadence of art, of taste, and of the
love for beauty. Finally, the art of Ethiopia, such as its still existing
monuments reveal it to us, is entirely wanting in originality. A
glance is sufficient to tell us that it represents the degeneracy only

of the Egyptian style, that the spirit of Egyptian forms has been
weakly grasped, and that their execution is generally mediocre." ^
We may condense all these views into a simple and easily
remembered formula ; we may say that as :ac inoitnt tozoards the
springs of the Nile, uc descend the current of time. Thebes is younger than Memphis, and Meroe than Thebes. The river
which Egypt worshipped, and by which the walls of its cities were
bathed, flowed from the centre of Africa, from the south to the
north ; but the stream of civilization flowed in the other direction,
until it was lost in the country of the negro, in the mysterious
depths of Ethiopia. The springs of this latter stream must be
sought in that district where the waters of the Nile, as if tired by
their long journey, divide into several arms before falling into the
sea ; in that district near the modern capital, over which stretch
the long shadows of the Pyramids.
§ 4. TJie Constitution of Egyptian Society—Infiience of that
Constitution upon Monuments of Art.
During the long sequence of centuries which we have divided
into three great periods, the national centre of gravity was more
than once displaced. The capital was at one time in Middle
Egypt, at another in Upper, and at a third period in Lower Egypt,
in accordance with its political necessities. At one period the
nation had nothing to fear from external enemies, at others it had
to turn a bold front to Asia or Ethiopia. At various times Egypt
had to submit to her foreign foes ; to the shepherd invaders, to the
kings of Assyria and Persia, to the princes of Ethiopia, and finally
to Alexander, to whom she lost her independence never again to
recover it. And yet it appears that the character and social
condition of the race never underwent any great change. At
the time of the pyramid-builders, Egypt was the most absolute
monarch}- that ever existed, and so she remained till her final
conquest.
^ Brugsch-Bey, Histoire de f Egypt, pp. 6 and 7. Maspero's Hisfoire ancienne, p. 382, may also be consulted upon the character of the Ethiopian kingdom and the monuments of Napata. A good idea of this process of degradation may be gained by merely glancing through the plates to part v. of Lepsius's Denknuclcr ; plate 6, for example, shows what the caryatid became at Napata.

" Successor and descendant of the deities who once reigned
over the valley of the Nile, the king v/as the living manifestation
and incarnation of God : child of the sun {Se Rd), as he took care
to proclaim whenever he wrote his name, the blood of the gods
flowed in his veins and assured to him the sovereign power." ^
He was ihe priest above all others. Such a form of worship as
that of Egypt, required no doubt a large sacerdotal class, each
member of which had his own special function in the complicated and gorgeous ceremonies in which he took part ; but the king
alone, at least in the principal temples, had the right to enter the
sanctuary and to open the door of the kind of chapel in which the
symbolical representation of the divinity was kept ; he alone saw
the god face to face, and spoke to him in the name of his people.'-^
The pre-eminent dignity of this priestly office did not, however,
prevent the king from taking his proper share in war or political
affairs generally. The army of scribes and various functionaries,
whose titles may still be read upon the most ancient monuments of
the country, depended upon him for their orders from one end of
the country to the other, and in war, it was he who led the serried
battalions of the Egyptian army. The king was thus a supreme
pontif, the immediate chief of all civil and military officers ; and,
as the people believed that his career was directed by the gods
with whom he held converse, he became to them a visible deity
and, in the words of an inscription, "the representative of Ra
among the living." His divinity, begun on earth, was completed
and rendered perpetual in another life. All the dead Pharaohs
became gods, so that the Egyptian pantheon obtained a new deity
at the death of each sovereign. The deceased Pharaohs thus
constituted a series of gods to whom the reigning sovereign would
of course address himself when he had anything to ask ; hence the
1 Maspero, Histoire ancieiiiie, p. 58. This affiliation of the king to the god was more than a figure of speech. In an inscription which is reproduced both at Ipsamboul and at Medinet-Abou, Ptah is made to speak in the following terms of Rameses II. and Rameses III. respectively: "I am thy father, as a god I have begotten thee ; all thy members are divine ; when I approached thy I'oyal mother I took upon me the form of the sacred ram of Mendes " (hne 3rd). This curious te.xt has lately been interpreted by E. Naville {Society of Biblical Archceology, vol. vii. pp. iig-138). The monarchy of the Incas was founded upon an almost identical belief.

The prestige which such a theory of royalty was calculated to
give to the Egyptian kings may easily be imagined. They
obtained more than respect ; they were the objects of adoration, of
idolatry. Brought up from infancy in this religious veneration, to
which their hereditary qualities also inclined them, generation
succeeded generation among the Egyptians, without any attempt
to rebel against the royal authority or even to dispute it. Ancient
Egypt, like its modern descendant, was now and then the scene of
military revolts. These were generally provoked by the presence
of foreign mercenaries, sometimes by their want of discipline and
licence, sometimes by the jealousy which they inspired in the
native soldiery ; but never,

spirit from which sprung the republican constitutions of Greece
and ancient Italy, a spirit which, in yet later times, has led to the
parliamentary governments of Christian Europe. The Egyptian
labourer or artisan never dreamt of calling in question the orders
of any one who might be master for the time. Absolute obedience
to the will of a sincrle man —such was the constant and instinctive
national habit, and by it every movement of the social machine,
under foreign and native kings alike, was regulated.

obtaining the necessary labour was compulsion.^ An order is

to another throughout his province ; next day the whole male
population is driven, like a troop of sheep, to the workshops.
Each man carries a bag or basket which holds his provisions for a
fortnight or a month, as the case may be ; a few dry cakes, onions,
garlic, and Egyptian beans, as the Greeks called the species of
almond which is contained in the fruit of the lotus. Old men and
children, all had to obey the summons. The more vigorous and
skilful among them dressed and put in place the blocks of granite

from another province, and all who had not succumbed to the hard
and continuous work, returned to their own places. Those who
died were buried in hasty graves dug in the sands of the desert by
the natives of their own village. The massive grandeur of some of the Egyptian monuments is
only to be explained by this levy en masse of every available pair
of hands. The kings of the ancient empire, at least, were
unable to dispose of those prisoners of war captured in myriads,
in whole races, by the Assyrian kings, and apparently employed
by them in the construction of Nineveh. Now, it is impossible that such works as the Pyramids could have been begun and
finished in the course of a single reign by free and remunerated
labour, even if it had the help of numerous slaves. Certain
arrangements in their design and the marvellously exact execution
of the more important details of the masonry, prove that architects

of great ability and skilful workmen were, indeed, employed upon
those gigantic works ; but the great bulk of the task must have
required the collective effort of a whole population ; of a popu
lation devoting themselves night and day to complete the work
when once begun, like ants over their subterranean city or bees over their comb.
Even supposing that history had been silent upon this subject,
the architect could easily divine, from these monuments them
selves, how they had been constructed. Cast your eyes upon
the ruins of the Athenian Acropolis ; their dimensions will seem
to you small in the extreme if you compare them with the
buildings of Egypt and Assyria ; on the other hand their
workmanship is equally careful throughout ; it is as exact and

experience for the special worlc upon which they were employed ; but the great majority were men suddenly taken from very
different occupations, from the oar, the plough, the management
of cattle ; who therefore could have nothing but their unskilled
labour to bestow. To such men as these a great part of the work
had perforce to be confided, in order that it might be complete at
the required time. In spite of the strictest supervision, the almost
religious care in the placing and fixing of masonry, v/hich might
be fairly expected from the practised members of a trade guild,
could not be ensured. Hence the singular inequalities and

majesty the buildings which he caused to spring, as if by magic, from the earth. Kis effigy was everywhere. Seated in the form

represented sometimes offering homage to the gods, sometimes
leading his troops to battle or bringing them home victorious.

power surpassed the power and dignity of ordinary men. The art
of Egypt was, in this sense, a monarchical art ; and in so being
it was the direct expression of the sentiments and ideas of the
society which had to create it from its foundations.
After the king came the priests, the soldiers, and the scribes or
royal functionaries, each receiving authority directly from the king
and superintending the execution of his orders. These three
groups formed what we may call the upper class of Egyptian
society. The soil was entirely In their hands. They possessed
among them the whole valley of the Nile, with the exception of
the roval domain. The aoTiculturists were inere serfs attached
to the soil. They cultivated, for a payment In kind, the lands
belonging to the privileged classes. They changed masters
with the lands upon which they lived, which they were not
allowed to quit without the permission of the local authorities.

Their position did not greatly differ from that of the modern
fellahs, who cultivate the Egyptian soil for the benefit of the
effendis, beys, and pachas or for that of the sovereign, who is still
the greatest landowner in the country.
The shepherds, the fishermen and boatmen of the Nile, the
artisans and shopkeepers of the cities were in a similar condition.
They lived upon their gains in the same way as the peasant upon
the share of the harvest which custom reserved for his use. As a
natural consequence of their life in a city and of the character of
their occupations, small traders and artisans enjoyed more liberty
and independence, more power of coming and going than the

asfriculturists, althouoh leral riohts were the same in both cases.
The burden of forced labour must have pressed less heavily upon
the latter class, and they must have had better opportunities of
escaping from it altogether.
In consequence of a mistaken interpretation of historic evidence,
it was long believed that the Egyptians had castes, like the
Hindoos. This notion has been dispelled by more careful study
of their remains. The vigorous separation of classes according to
their social functions, the enforced heredity of professions, and
the prohibition of intermarriage between the different groups,
never obtained a footing in Egypt. We often find, in Egyptian

was, in all probability, more heredity of occupation ; in the ordi
nary course the paternal employment fixed that of the children,
but yet there was nothing approaching- to an absolute rule. The
various trades were formed into corporations or guilds, rather than
castes in the strict sense of the word. From this it resulted that
great natural talents, fortunate circumstances, or the favour of the
sovereign could raise a man of the lowest class up to the highest
dignities of the state. In the latter days of the monarchy we have an example of this in the case of Amasis, who, born among
the dregs of the population, finally raised himself to the throne.'

Starting as a piivate soldier for the war against the Shepherds, undertaken for the re-conquest of Avaris, he was noticed by the king for hts frequent acts of gallantry, and promoted until he finally became something in the nature of high admiral.

owe to the burial-places which the members of the governing
classes were in the habit of preparing during their lifetime in
the necropolis of Memphis. We may say the same of the early
centuries of the Middle Empire. The Egypt of the great kings
belonging to the twelfth dynasty has been preserved for us upon
the tombs of Ameni and Num-Hotep, the governors of the iioii/cs
in which they were buried. It is to the burial chambers at Gizeh,
at Sakkarah, at Meidoum, and at Beni-Hassan that we must go for
complete types of sepulchral architecture at those epochs ; to the
statues in the recesses of their massive walls and to the bas-reliefs
in their narrow chambers, we must turn for those features of early Egyptian civilization which remained for many centuries

mat, from the shepherd with his flock or the hunter pushing his
shallop through the brakes of papyrus, to the directors of the great
public works and the princes of the blood who governed conquered
provinces or guarded the frontiers of the country at the head of
ever faithful armies. The art of Egypt resembled that of Greece in being a complete
and catholic art, seeing everything and taking an interest in every
thing. It was sensitive to military glory, and at the same time it
did not scorn to portray the peaceful life of the fields. It set itself
with all sincerity to interpret the monarchical sentiment in its most
enthusiastic and exaggerated form, but while it placed kings and princes above and almost apart from humanity, it did not forget
the " humble and meek," on the contrary, it frankly depicted them
in their professional attitudes, with all those ineffaceable character
istics, both of face and figure which the practice of some special
trade so certainly imparts. Looked at from this point of view
Egyptian art was popular, it might even be called democratic,
but that such a phrase would sound curious when used in con
nection with the most absolute monarchy which the world has
ever seen.
This absolute power, however, does not seem, speaking generally,
to have been put in force in a hard or oppressive manner either by
the king himself or by his agents. M. Maspero and others who,
like him, live in intimate communion with the ancient Egyptians,
declare that they were by no means unhappy. They tell us that
the confidences whispered to them in the pictured tomb-houses of Sakkarah and Memphis complain of no misery, from the time of
Mena to that of Psemethek, except during a few violent reigns
and a few moments of national crisis. The country suffered only
on those comparatively rare occasions when the sceptre passed into
the hands of an incapable master or into those of some insatiable
warrior who thought only of satisfying his own ambition, and
sacrificed to the day the resources of the future. Egypt, with her
river, her teeming soil and her splendid climate, found life easy as
long as she enjoyed an easy and capable administration. She then
gave to her princes almost without an effort all they could desire or demand. It was one of the fundamental principles of Egyptian morality
that those who were powerful should treat the poor and feeble with
kindness and consideration. Their sepulchral inscriptions tell us



The Constitution of Egyptian Society. 39
that their kings and princes of the blood, their feudal lords and
functionaries of every grade, made it a point of honour to observe
this rule. They \vere not content with strict justice, they practised
a bountiful charity which reminds us of that which is the chief
beauty of the Christian's morality. The " Book of the Dead"

that passport for Egyptians into the other world which is found
upon every mummy—gives us the most simple, and at the same
time the most complete description of this virtue. " I have given
bread to the hungry, I have given water to the thirsty, I have clothed the naked ... I have not calumniated the slave in the
ears of his master." The lengthy panegyrics of which some
epitaphs consist, are, in reality no more than amplifications of this

theme. "As for me, I have been the staff of the old man, the
nurse of the infant, the help of the distressed, a warm shelter for
all who were cold in the Thebaid, the bread and sustenance of the down-trodden, of whom there is no lack in Middle Egypt, and their
protector against the barbarians."^ The prince Entef relates that
he has " arrested the arm of the violent, used brute force to those
who used brute force, showed hauteur to the haughty, and lowered
the shoulders of those who raised them up," that he himself on the
other hand, " was a man in a thousand, wise, learned, and of a sound and truthful judgment, knowing the fool from the wise man, paying

attention to the skilful and turning his back upon the ignorant,
. . . the father of the miserable and the mother of the motherless,
the terror of the cruel, the protector of the disinherited, the defender
of those whose goods were coveted by men stronger than them
selves, the husband of the widow, the asylum of the orphan." ^
Amoni, hereditary prince of the nome of Meh, talks in the same
fashion. " I have caused sorrow to no youth under age, I have
despoiled no widow, nor have I repelled any labourer, I have
imprisoned no shepherd, I have never taken for the labour gangs
the serfs of him who had but five, there have been no paupers, nor
has any man or woman starved in my time ; for, although there
have been years of scarcity, I have caused all the tillable land in
Meh to be tilled, from the northern frontier to that of the south, and have made such arrangements and such provision for the people that there has been no famine among them ; I have given to the widow and to the married woman alike, and I have never
made any distinction between the great and the small in my
gifts.
Doubtless these laudatory self-descriptions may be exaggerated
in some respects ; hyperbole has ever been a favourite figure with
the composers of epitaphs, and those of Egypt formed no
exception to the rule. As M. Maspero remarks in connection
with this question, " The man as he is, often differs very greatly
from the man as he thinks he is." But we may safely say that the
Egyptian realized some portion of the ideal which he set before
himself If only to obtain admiration and esteem, he would
practice, to a certain extent, the virtues of which he boasted.
Many signs combine to tell us that the Egyptians of all classes
possessed a large fund of tenderness and good-will. The master
was often both clement and charitable ; the peasant, the servant,
and the slave, were patient and cheerful, and that in spite of
the fatisfue of labours which could never enrich them. In a
country so favoured by nature, men had so few wants that they
had no experience of all that is implied by that doleful word

poverty, with us. The pure skies and brilliant sunshine, the deep
draughts of Nile water, and the moments of repose under the
shadows of the sycamores, the freshness of the evening bath, the
starry night with its reinvigorating breezes, were all enjoyments
which the poorest could share.
We need feel no surprise therefore at the vivacity with which
one of the most learned of the historians of Egypt, Brugsch-Bey,
protests against the common misconception of the Egyptians " as
a race grave, serious, morose, exclusive, religious, thinking much
of the next world, and little of this ; living, in a word, like the
Trappists of former days. Are we to believe," he cries, " that this
majestic river and the fertile soil through which it flows, this azure
sky with its unclouded sun, produced a nation of living mummies,
a race of solemn philosophers who looked upon life in this world
as a burden to be shuffled off as quickly as possible ? Travel over Egypt ; examine the scenes painted and sculptured upon the walls
of sepulchral chambers ; read the inscriptions carved upon stone
or traced in ink upon the rolls of papyrus, and you will find
yourself compelled to modify the false notions you have imbibed as
to the Egyptian philosophers. Nothing could be more cheerful,
more amusing or more frank, than the social life of this pleasure
loving people. Far from wishing to die, they prayed to the gods
for a long life and a happy old age ; they prayed that, " if possible,
they might live to the perfect age of one hundred and ten."
They were addicted to all kinds of pleasures. They drank, they
sang, they danced, they were fond of excursions into the country,
where the sports of hunting and fishing were specially reserved for
the upper class. As a natural effect of this desire for enjoyment,
gay conversation and pleasantry which was sometimes rather free,
jokes and what we should call chaff, were much in vogue : even
their tombs were not sacred from their desire for a jest." ^
The worst government, the sternest oppression, could never ex
tinguish this natural gaiety ; it was too intimately connected with
the climate and the natural conditions of the country, conditions which had never changed since the days of Menes. Never were
the Egyptians more roughly treated than under Mehemet Ali and
the late viceroy ; their condition was compared, with justice, to
that of the negroes in Carolina and Virginia, who, before the
American civil war, laboured under the whips of their drivers, and

barely sufficient to keep life in their bodies. Torn from their
homes and kept by force In the public works, the fellahs died in thousands ; those who remained in the fields had to pay the taxes
one or two years in advance ; they were never out of debt,
nominally, to the public treasury, and the rattan of the collector
extorted from them such savings as they might make during years
of plenty, up to the last coin. But still laughter did not cease in
Egypt ! Look, for instance, at the children in the streets of Cairo
who let out mounts to sight-seeing Europeans. Let the tourist

his side, full of spirits and good humour ; and yet perhaps while

At sunset these young labourers quitted their \vork and seated
themselves in groups, according to their native villages, upon the still warm sand. Each drew from a little sack, containing his
provision for two or three weeks, a dry cake ; those whose parents
were comfortably off had also, perhaps, a leek or a raw onion.

While I listened to the alternate rise and fall of the chorus
outside, I reflected upon how little those children required ; upon

The Egyptian Rcligio)i and its Injhicncc upon the
Plastic Arts.
We have still to notice the profoundly religious character of
Egyptian art. " The first thing that excites our surprise, when
we examine the reproductions of Egyptian monuments which have
been published in our day, is the extraordinary number of scenes of sacrifice and worship which have come down to us. In the
collection of plates which we owe to contemporary archaeologists,
we can hardly find one which does not contain the figure of some
deity, receiving with impassive countenance the prayers or
offerings of a prostrate king or priest. One would say that a
country with so many sacred pictures and sculjitures, must have
been inhabited by gods, and by just enough men for the service
of their temples.^ The Egyptians were a devout people. Either
by natural tendency or by force of education, they saw God
pervading the whole of their universe ; they lived in Him and for
Him. Their imaginations were full of His greatness, their words
of His praise, and their literature was in great part inspired by
gratitude for the benefits which He showered upon them. Most of their manuscripts which have come down to us treat of
religious matters, and even in those which are ostensibly
concerned only with profane subjects, mythological names and
allusions occur on every page, almost at every line."
An examination into the primitive religious beliefs of the
Egyptians is full of difficulty. In discovering new papyri, in
' The saying of one of the characters of Petronius might be appHed to Egypt
:
" This country is so thickly peopled with divinities that it is easier to find a god than a man." The place held by religious observances in the daily life of Egypt is clearly indicated by Hkrodotus (ii. 37): "The Egyptians," he says, "are very religious; they surpass all other nations in the adoration with which they regard their deities." ^ Maspero, Hiitotre anciennc, pp. 26, 27.

will establish facts which are sure not to lack interest and even importance ; but even when documents abound and when every

separate word they contain is understood, even then it is very
difficult to penetrate to the root of their meaning. A ghmpse will
be caught of it, I admit, by one of those efforts of inductive
divination which distinguish modern research ; but even then it will
remain to explain the primitive and only half-understood notions
of five or six thousand years ago in the philosophical vocabularies
of to-day. It is here that the most difficult and irksome part of
the task begins. We who represent the old age, or, perhaps, the
prime, of humanity, think of these matters and speak of them as
abstractions, while the Egyptians, who were children compared
to us, thought of them under concrete forms. Their very ideals
were material, more or less vague and refined perhaps, but still
material. Their only conception of a deity was of a figure larger,
more vigorous and more beautiful than mortals ; the powers and
attributes with which it was endowed were all physical. If we
attempt to express their conceptions in abstract terms, we falsify
their meaning. We cannot avoid altering it to a certain e.xtent,
for exact equivalents are not to be found, and, in spite of all
precautions, we give to the confused and childish ideas of ancient
religion, a precision which is entirely modern.
If, under these reserves, we study the Egyptian theology in its
most learned and refined form—namely, that which it attained
during the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties—we shall dimly
perceive that it implies a belief in the unity of the First Cause of
all life. But this belief is obscured behind the numerous gods
who are, in fact, emanations from its substance and manifestations
of its indefatigable activity. It is in the person of these gods that
the divine essence takes form. Each of them has his own name,
his own figure, and his own special share in the management of
the universe ; each of them presides over the production of some
particular order of phenomena and insures their regularity.
These gods are related to each other as fathers, mothers, and
sons. They thus form a vast hierarchy of beings, superior to
man, and each enjoying a dignity corresponding to his rank in
the series. There is, so to speak, most of divinity in those who
are nearest to the "one God in heaven or earth who was not
begotten." These deities are divided into groups of three, each
group constituting a family, like those of earth, consisting of
father, mother, and son. Thus from triad to triad, the concealed
god develops his sovereign powers to all eternity, or, to use an



The Egyptian Religion and the Plastic Arts. 47
expression clear to the religious schools of ancient Egypt, " he
creates his own members, which are themselves gods."^
How should the science of comparative religion class this
form of faith ? Should it be called polytheism or pantheism ?
The answer is, perhaps, not of great importance, and this is hardly
the place for its discussion. It is certain that, practically, the
Egyptians were polytheists. The Egyptian priests, indeed, had,
by dint of long reflection, arrived at the comprehension, or at
least at the contemplation, of that First Cause which had started
the river of life —that inexhaustible stream of which the Nile with
its fertilising waves was the concrete image — in its long journey
across time and space. But the devotion of the people themselves
never succeeded in mountinof above the minor divinities, above
those intermediaries in whom the divine principle and attributes
became personified and put on the tangibility of body necessary
to make them intelligible to childish understandings. So, too,
was it with artists, and for still more powerful reasons ; as
by forms only could they express the ideas which they had
conceived. Even in those religions which are most clearly and
openly monotheistic and spiritual, such as Christianity, art has
done something of the same kind. Aided in secret by one of the
most powerful instincts of the human soul, it has succeeded, in
spite of all resistance and protestation, in giving plastic expression
to those parts of our belief which seem least fitted lor such
treatment ; and it has caused those methods of expression to be
so accepted by us that we see nothing unnatural in the represent
ation under the features of an old man, of the first Person of the
Trinity, —of that Jehovah who, In the Old Testament, proscribed all
graven Images with such Impartial rigour ; who, in the Evangel,
described Himself as " tlie Truth and the Life."
In Egypt, both sculptors and painters could multiply their
images to infinity without coming into collision with dogma,
without provoking the regrets or censures of its most severe
interpreters. Doctrine did not condemn these personifications,
even when it had been refined and elaborated by the speculative
' This formula frequently occurs in the texts. To cite but one occasion, we find upon a Theban invocation to Amen, translated by P.PihRRET {Rccueil de Travaux relatifs a la Philologie et a V Archeologie egyptienne el assyrienne, t. i. \). 70), at the third line of the inscription : " Sculptor, thou modelest thine own members; thou begettest them, not having thyself been begotten."



48 A History of Art ix Ancient Egypt.
theologians of Thebes and HeHopoHs. In the interior of the
temples, there was a small class of mystics who took pleasure in
contemplating " the ' One ' who exists by his own essential power,
the only being who substantially exists." Even then men tried,
as they have often done since, to define the undefinable, to grasp
the incomprehensible, to perceive the supreme " I am " through
the shifting and transparent veil of natural phenomena. But
those refined metaphysics never touched and influenced the crowd,
and never will. The deity, in order to be perceived by them
and to touch their feelings, must have his unity broken ; he must,
if the expression be admissible, be cut up into morsels for them.
By a process of abstraction which is as old as religion itself the
human intelligence is led to consider separately each of the qualities
of existence, each of the forces which it perceives to be at work
either within man himself or in the exterior world. At first it
thinks those forces and qualities are distributed impartially to all
creation. It confounds existence with life. Hence the reign of
fetishism, when man believes, as young children do, that thought,
passion, and volition like his own, are to be found in everything he
meets. His own image seems to him reflected as in a mirror with
a thousand converging facets, and he is unable to distinguish the
real condition of things outside it.
Certain celestial and terrestrial bodies make a particularly strong
impression upon his mind by their size, their beauty, by their evil
or beneficial effects upon himself They fill him with more than
the average gratitude, admiration, or terror. Driven by the illusion
which possesses him, he places the origin of those qualities which
seem to him the highest and most important, in the bodies which
have made so deep an impression upon his senses ; to them he
attributes the friendly or hostile influences which alternately excite
his desire and his fear. According to circumstances a fetish might
be a mountain, a rock or a river, a plant or an animal. It might
be those heavenly bodies which exercised much more influence over
the life of primitive man than they do over us ; it might be the moon and stars, which tempered the darkness of the night and
diminished its terrors ; it might be the cloud, from whose bosom
came rain and thunder ; above all, it might be the sun which re
turned every morning to light and warm the world. Differences of climate and race had their modifying effect, but everywhere one
common characteristic is to be found. It was always to some



The Egyptian Religion and the Plastic Arts. 49
material and visible object that the human intellect referred those
forces and qualities which it drew from its own consciousness ;
forces which, when thus united with something tangible, constituted
the first types of those divine beings whom mankind have so long
adored, to whom they have turned for ages in their hope and fear.
As the years passed away, man advanced beyond his primitive
conceptions. He did not entirely renounce them—we may indeed see
reminiscences of them all around us— but he super imposed others upon them which were more complex. His powers of observa
tion, still imperfect though they were, began to insinuate into his
mind a disbelief in the activity of inanimate matter, and those
objects which were nearest to him, which he could touch with his
hand, were the first victims of his disenchantment. Thus began
a long course of intellectual development, the result of which we
know, although the various stages of its progress are difficult to
follow at this distance of time. It appears certain, however, that
star worship formed the transition between /t'//s/iis;u ^wdi polytheism.
Men no longer attributed vital forces and pre-eminent qualities
generally to bodies with which they themselves were in immediate
contact, to stones and trees ; but they found no difficulty in con
tinuing to assign them to those great luminaries whose distance
and beauty placed them, so to speak outside the material world.
As they gradually deprived inanimate matter of the properties
with which they had once gifted it, they sought for new objects to
which they might attach those properties. These they found in
the stars which shone in the firmament century after century,
and knew neither old age nor death ; and especially in the most
brilliant, the most beneficent, and the most necessary of them all,
in that sun whose coming they awaited every morning with an
impatience which must once ha\'e been mixed with a certain
amount of anxiety.
The attributes which awakened intelligence had taken away
from the inanimate objects of the world could not be left floating
in space. They became gradually and imperceptibly grouped in
men's minds around the great luminary of day, and a bond of union
was found for the different members of the group by endowing
the sun with a personality modelled upon that of man. This
operation was favoured by the constitution of contemporary
language, by its idioms made up entirely of those images and
metaphors which, by their frank audacity, surprise and charm us

in the works of the early poets. It commenced with the first
awakening of thought, when man endowed all visible nature with
the bounding life which he felt in his own veins. No effort of
intelligence was required for its commencement or for its pro
secution. The sun became a young hero advancing, full of pride and vigour, upon the path prepared for him by Aurora ; a hero who
pursued his daily path in spite of all obstacle or hindrance, who,
when evening came, went to his rest amid all the glories of an
eastern sunset, and amid the confidence of all that after his hours of
sleep he would take up his eternal task with renewed vigour. He
was an invincible warrior. He was sometimes an angry master,
whose glance killed and devoured. He was above all the untiring
benefactor of mankind, the nurse and father of all life. Whether
as Indra or as Amen-Ra, it was the same cry that went up to him from Egypt and Hindostan ; the prayers which we find in the
\'^edas and in the papyri, breathe the same sentiments and were
addressed to the same god.^
This solar god and the divinities who resemble him, form the
transition from the simple fetish to complete deities, to those gods
who played such an important part in the Egyptian religion, and
attained to their highest and most complete development in the
Hellenic mythology. In some respects, the luminous globe of the
sun with its compulsory course, belonged to the same category as
the material objects which received the first worship of humanity.
But its brilliance, its tranquil and majestic movement, and the
distance which conceals its real substance from the eye of man,
allowed his imagination to endow it with the purest and noblest
characteristics which the finest examples of humanity could show
;
while the phenomena which depend upon its action are so numerous
that there was no hesitation in assigning to it qualities and energies
of the most various kinds.
This type when once established was used for the creation of
other deities, which were all, so to speak, cast in the same mould.
As the intellect became more capable of abstraction and analysis,
the person:ility and moral individuality of these gods gradually
threw off its astral or physical characteristics, although it never
lost all trace of their e.xistence. It resulted that, both in Egypt
and in Greece, there were deities who were mere entities, the
1 See the fine hymns quoted and translated by M. Maspero in his Histoire
anciaiitc, pji. 30-37.



The Egyptian Religion and the Plastic Arts. 51
simple embodiment oi some
power, some quality, or
some virtue. It requires
all the subtle Jiiicssc of
modern criticism to seek
out and distinguish the
obscure roots which attach
these divinities to the natu
ralistic beliefs of earlier
aees. Sometimes absolute
certainty is not to be at
tained, but Ave may safely
say that a race is poly
theistic when we find these
abstract deities among their
gods, such deities as the
Ptah, Amen, and Osiris of
the Egyptians, and the
Apollo and Athene of the
Greeks.^
We may, then, define
polytheism as the partition
of the highest attributes oi
life between a limited
number of agents. The
imagination of man could
not give these agents life without at the same time en
dowing them with essential
natural characteristics and
with the human form, but,
nevertheless, it wished to

system had said its last word and was complete, when it
had succeeded in embodying in some divine personality each of those forces whose combined energy produces movement in
the world or guarantees its duration.
When religious evolution follows
its normal course, the work of
reflection goes on, and in course
of time makes new discoveries. It
refers, by efforts of conjecture, all
phenomena to a certain number of
causes, which it calls gods. It next
perceives that these causes, or gods,
are of unequal importance, and so
it constitutes them into a hierarchy.
Still later it begins to comprehend
that many of these causes are but
different names for one thing, that
they form but one force, the appli
cation of a single law. Thus by
reduction and simplification, by
logic and analysis, is it carried on
to recognize and proclaim the unity
of all cause. And thus monotheism
succeeds to polytheism.
In Egypt, religious speculation
arrived on the threshold of this
doctrine. Its depths were dimly perceived, and it was even taught
by the select class of priests who
were the philosophers of those
days ; but the monotheistic con
ception never penetrated into the
minds of the great mass of the
people. 1 Moreover, by the very method in which Egyptian myth
ology described it, it was easily adapted to the^ national poly
theism, or even to fetish worship. The theory of emanations

1 In his work entitled Des deux Yeux dii Disque solaire, M. Grebaut seems to have
very clearly indicated how far we are justified in saying that Egyptian religious s|)eculation at times approached monotheism (Rccueil de Travaux, efc, t. i. p. 120).

reconciled everything. The different gods were but the different
quahties of the eternal substance, the various manifestations of
one creative force. These qualities and energies were revealed by
being imported into the world ot
form. They took finite shape and were made comprehensible to the
intellect of man by their mysterious
birth and generation. It was
necessary, if the existence of the
eods were to be brought home to
mankind, that each of them should have a form and a domicile. I magi
nation therefore did well in com
mencinof to distinguish and define
the gods ; artists were piously
occupied when they pursued the
same course. They gave precision
of contour to the forms roughly
sketched, and by the established
definition which they gave to each
divine figure, we might almost say
that they created the gods.
Their task was, in one sense,
more difficult than that of the Greek artists. When newly born Greek art first began to make re
presentations of Greek deities, the
work of intellectual analysis and
abstraction had already come to a
state of maturity which it never
reached in Egypt. The divinities
were fewer in number and conse
quently more fixed and decided in
their individual characteristics. The
Egyptian polytheism was always
more mixed, more strongly tinged
with fetishism than that of Greece.
Even in those centuries in which the ideas of the Egyptian people
were most elevated and refined, the three successive stages, which

are always found in the development of religious life, co-existed in
the mind of the nation. A few more or less isolated thinkers were
already seeking to formulate monotheism. The dlitc of the nation

the king, the priest, and the military class —were adoring Amen and Ptah, Khons or Khonsu,
INIouth, Osiris and Horus, Sekhet, Isis, Nephtisand many
other divinities ; all more or
less abstract in their nature,
and presiding over special phe
non'vina. As for the lower
orders of the people, they knew
the names of these deities and
associated themselves with the great public honours which were paid to them ; but their homage and their faith were
more heartily rendered to such concrete and visible eods as
the sacred animals, as the bulls Apis and Mnevis, the goat of
Mendes, the ibis, the hawk, &c.
None of the peculiarities of
Egyptian civilization struck
Greek travellers with more
amazement than this semi
worship of animals.^
Later theology has suc
ceeded in giving more or less
subtle and specious explana
tions of these forms of worship.
Each of these animals has
been assigned, as symbol or
attribute, to one of the greater
deities. As for ourselves we have no doubt that these
objects of popular devotion were no more than ancient fetishes.
In the long prehistoric centuries, while the Egyptian race was
occupied in making good its possession of the Nile valley and

brineine it into cultivation, imasfination deified these animals,
some for the services which they rendered, others for the
terror which they inspired ; and it was the same with certain
vegetables. We find traces of this phenomenon, which at first seems so
inexplicable, among the other races of antiquity, but it is nowhere
else so marked as it is in Egypt. When Egypt, after being for
three centuries subject to the influence and supremacy of the
Greek genius, had lost all but the shadow of its former indepen
dence and national liie ; when all the energy and intellectual
activity which remained to it was concentrated at the Greco-Syrian
rather than Egyptian Alexandria, the ancient religion of the race
lost all its highest branches.^ The aspirations towards mono
theism took a form that was either philosophical and Platonic or
Christian ; and as tor the cultivated spirits who wished to continue
' We do not mean to say that the higher (luahties of the Egyptian rehgion were then altogether lost. In Roman Egypt the fetish superstitions were no doubt predominant, but still it had not lost all that theological erudition which it had accumulated by its own intellectual energy. In an inscription cut in the time of Philip the Arab, we find an antique hymn transcribed in hieroglyphs upon the wall of a temple. We find abstract and speculative ideas in all those Egyptian hooks which have come down to us, in a form which betrays the last two centuries of the Empire. .Alexandria had its Egyptian Serapeum by the side of its Greek one. Monuments are to be found there which are Egyptian in every particular. Gnosticism was particuLirly successful in Egypt, which was predestined to accept it by the whole of its past. Certain doctrines of Plotinus are thus best explained. More llian one purely Egyptian notion may be found interpreted in the works of Alexandrian philosophers and in the phraseology of Greek philosophy. The principal sanctuaries did not allow their rites and ceremonies to fall into disuse. Although Thebes was nothing but a heap of ruins, a dead city visited for its relics of the past, the worship of Vulcan, that is of Ptah, at Memjihis, was carried on up to the establisli
ment of Christianity. That of Isis. at Phila;, lasted until the time of Justinian. Diocletian negotiated a treaty with the Blemmyes. those peoi)le of Nubia who were at one time such redoubtable soldiers, which guaranteed to them the free use of that temple. It was not converted into a church until after the destruction of the Blemmyes by Silco and the Christian kings of Ethiopia. The old religion and theology of the Egyjjtians did not exjiire in a single day. It was no more killed by the Roman conquest than it was by that of the Ptolemies. But although its rites did not cease, and some of its elaborate doctrines still continued to be transmitted, its vitality had come to an end. It exercised some remains of influence only on condition of being melted do>vn and re-modelled in the crucible of Greek philosophy. A little colerie of thinkers set themselves to complete this transfusion, but the great mass of the people returned to simple practices which had been sanctified by thousands of j-ears, and formed nearly the whole of their
religion.

the personification of the eternal forces of the world and of the
laws which govern them, these laws and forces presented themselves to their minds in the forms which had been figured
and described by the sculptors, painters, and writers of Greece.
They accepted, without hesitation or dispute, the numbers and
physical characteristics of the divine types of Greece. From
end to end of the habitable earth, as the Greeks boasted, the
gods of the Hellenic pantheon absorbed and assimilated all
those of other nationalities ; within the boundaries of the Roman
Empire, at least, its polytheism became a kind of universal
religion for civilized humanity, and was adopted by nations of the
most diverse orisjin and lanwuao-e. The lower classes alone, who
read neither Homer nor Hesiod and were unable to admire the
statues of the Greek sculptors, were kept free from the powerful
and softening influence of poetry and art. They guarded with
obstinacy the ancient foundations of their early faith, and in the
void left by the disappearance of the national gods, their primitive
beliefs seem to have put on a new life and to have enjoyed a
restored prestige. Thus we may see, in forest clearings, the
ancient but still vigorous stumps of great trees which have been
felled send out fresh shoots to renew their youth.
This persistence, this apparent recrudescence of fetishism made
itself felt in Egypt alone. It amazed and scandalized both pagans
and Christians during the early centuries of Christianity. They
mocked at a people who " hardly dared to bite a leek or an
onion : who adored divinities which (jrew in their own Qrardens," ^
and a god which was nothing but a " beast wallowing on a purple
carpet." '-^ Guided by a more critical knowledge of the past, we are
now better able to understand the origin of these beliefs and the
secret of their long duration. We are enabled to account for them
by that inexperience which falsifies all the judgments of infancy,
in the race as well as in the individual ; we see that they are the
exaggeration of a natural sentiment, which becomes honourable and worthy of our sympathy when it is addressed to the useful
and laborious helpers of man, to domestic animals, for instance,
such as the cow and the draught ox.

The Egyptian Religion and the Plastic Arts. 57
It would be interesting to know why these beHefs were so
curiously tenacious of life in Egypt ; perhaps the reason is to be
found in the prodigious antiquity of Egyptian civilization. That
civilization was the oldest which the world has seen, the least
remote from the day of man's first appearance upon the earth. It
may therefore be supposed to have received more deeph', and
maintained more obstinately, tliose impressions which characterize
the infancy of men as well as of mankiaid. Add to this, that other
races in their eftorts to emerge from barbarism, were aided and incited by the example of races which had preceded them on the
same road. The inhabitants of the Nile V^alley, on the other
hand, were alone in the world for many centuries ; they had to
depend entirely upon their own internal forces for the accomplish
ment of their emancipation ; it is, therefore, hardly surprising that
they should have remained longer than their successors in that
fetish worship which we have asserted to be the first stage of
religious development.^
This stage must never be forgotten, if we wish to understand
the jaart which art played in the figuring of the. Egyptian gods.
1 This was perceived by the President de Brosses, a savant with few advantages but a bold and inquiring spirit, to whom the language is indebted for tlie use of the term fetishism as a name for a definite state of religious conception. We can still read with interest the book which he published anonymously in 1760, under the title : Di/ Culte des Dieiix fetiches ; on, Parall'ele de fAncienue Jieligioii de F Egypte avccla Religion actuelle de Nigritie (i3mo). The study of the fetish elements of the Egyptian religion has been resumed lately with competent knowledge and talent by a German egyptologist. Herr Pietschmann, in an essay which apjjeared in 1878 in the Zeitschrift/iir Ethnologic, which is published in Berlin under the direction of M. Virchow.
It is called Dcr ^gyptische Fetischdiinst und Gotlerglaube —Prolegomena c?/r ALgyptischen Mythologie (28 pp. 8vo). A great many judicious observations and curious facts are to be found in it ; the realistic and materialistic character of the Egyptian conceptions are very well grasped ; it is perhaps to be regretted that the author has not endeavoured to make the creeds to which he gives this name of fctichisme somewhat clearer, and to show by what workings of the mind they were adopted and abandoned. With regard to the Egyptian religion, we shall find treated, in the excellent Manuel de I'Histoire des Religions, by Tiele, which M. Maurice Yernes has just translated from the Dutch (i vol i2mo, Ernest Leroux, 1880), views much the same as those which we have just described. The author denominates the religious state which we call fetishism animism, but he points out the fact that this class of conceptions had a perennial influence over the Egyptian mind. "The Egyptian religion," he says, " like the Chinese, was nothing to begin with but an organised animism." He finds traces of this animism in the worshij) of the dead, the deification of the king.s, and the adoration of animals. From his point of view the custom of placing a symbol of the divinity rather than an image in the temple, must be traced to fetishism (pp. 44 and 45 of the French version). VOL. \. I



58 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
In most of the types which it created it mixed up the physical
characteristics of man and beast. Sometimes the head of an animal surmounts the body of a man or woman ; sometimes, though more rarely, the opposite arrangement obtains. The Sphinx, and the bird with a human head which symbolizes death,
are instances of the latter combination. The usual explanation of
these forms Is as follows. When men began to embody for the
eye of others the Ideas which they had formed of the divine
powers, they adopted as the foundation for their personifications
the noblest living form they
knew, that of man. In the
next place they required some
easy method for distinguishing
their imaginary beings one from
another. They had to give to
each deity some feature which
should be peculiar to him or
her self, and should allow of
his being at once identified and called by his own name. The
required result was obtained
In a very simple manner, by
adding to the constant quantity
the human figure, a varying
element in the heads of different
animals. These the fauna of

Egypt itself afforded. In the
case of each divinity, the par
ticular animal was selected which had been consecrated to it, which was Its symbol
or at least its attribute, and the head or body, as the case
might be, was detached in order to form part of a complex and
Imaginary being. The special characteristics of the animal made
use of were so frankly insisted upon that no confusion could
arise between one deity and another. Even a child could not
fail to see the difference between .Sekhet, with the head of a cat
or a lioness, and Hathor, with that of a cow.
We do not refuse to accept this explanation, but yet we may
express our surprise that the Egyptians, who were able, even In

the days of the ancient empire, to endow the statues of their kings
with so much purity and nobihty of form, were not disgusted by
the strangeness of such combinations, by their extreme grotesque
ness, and by the disagreeable results which they sometimes
produced. A certain beauty may be found in such creations as

the chisel. That they
tented themselves with
awkward that, perhaps,
and ponderous head of a crocodile, or flat head of a snake ?
Every polytheistic nation attacked
this problem in turn, and each solved
it in its own manner. The Hindoos
multiplied the human figure by itself,
and painted or carved their gods with three heads and many pairs of arms
and legs, of which proceeding traces are to be found among the Western
Asiatics, the Greeks, and even the
Latins. The Greeks represented all
their gods in human form, and yet by
the delicacy of their contours and the
o-eneral coherence of their character
o
ization, they were enabled to avoid all
confusion between them. With them,
too, costume and attributes helped to mark the difference. But even where
these are absent, our minds are never
left in doubt. Even a fragment of a
torso can be at once recognized at
sight as part of a statue of Zeus, of
Apollo, or of Bacchus, and a head of Demeter or Hera would never be confounded with one of Artemis or
Pallas.
It may be said that the artists of
Egypt were lacking in the skill
necessary for all this, or that they
generalized their forms to such a
degree as to leave no scope for such
subtle differences. But, in fact, we
find in their oldest statues a facility
of execution which suggests that, had
they chosen", they could have expressed anything which can be expressed by did not do so, we know. They con

in some hereditary predisposition, some habit of thought and
action contracted in the infancy of the race and fortified by long
transmission.
We have already spoken of that which we believe to be the
cause of the peculiar forms under which the Egyptians figured
their deities, namely, the fetish worship, which was the earliest, and
for many centuries the only, form of religion which they possessed.
That worship had struck its roots so deeply into the souls of the
people, that it could not be torn up even when a large part of the
nation had gradually educated itself to
the comprehension of the highest re
ligious conceptions. Its practices never
fell into total neglect, and its influence
was so far maintained that during the
decadence of the nation it a^ain became
the ruling faith, so that foreign observers
were led to believe that the Egyptian
religion began and ended in the adora
tion of plants and sacred animals. The
eyes and the imagination being thus
educated by immemorial custom, it is
not surprising that even the most culti
vated section of the people should have
seen nothing offensive in the representa
tion of their gods sometimes under the complete form of an animal (Horus is
often symbolized under the likeness of a
hawk), sometimes as composite monsters
with human bodies and animal heads.
Take, for a moment, the bird to which we have just alluded. The
hawk, like the vulture, plays an important part in Egyptian
art. The vulture symbolizes Maut, the spouse of Amen. It
furnishes the sign by which her name is written, and sometimes, as
the symbol of maternity, its head appears over the brow of the goddess, its wings forming her head-dress. The goddess Nekheb,
who symbolizes the region of the South, is also represented by a
vulture.^ So it is with the ibis. It supplies the character by
which the name Thoth is written, and that god is figured with the

head of an Ibis. The part played by these birds in the repre
sentation of the gods, both in the plastic arts and in writing, is to
be explained by the sentiments of gratitude and religious venera
tion of which they were the objects, sentiments which were the
natural outcome of the practical services which they rendered to mankind.
When the early fathers of the nation first established themselves
upon the banks of the Nile, they found invaluable allies in those
energetic birds of prey, and the alliance has been continued to
their latest descendants. After the annual inundation the damp
earth was overrun by toads and frogs, by snakes and lizards and
all kinds of creeping things. Fishes, left by the retreating flood
in pools which were soon dried up by the blazing sun, perished, and, decomposing, rendered the air noisome and
malarious. In addition to this there were the
corpses of wild and domestic animals, and the offal of every kind which accumulated round the
dwellings of the peasantry and rapidly became
putrid under the sun of Egypt. If left to , ^. . decompose they would soon have bred a pesti
^1 / lence, and in those days human effort was not
to be reckoned upon in the work of sanitation.
To birds of prey, then, was assigned the in
dispensable work of elimination and transforma
tion, an office which they yet fill satisfactorily
(from Wilkinson). in the towus and villages of Africa. Thanks to
their appetite and to the powerful wings which
carried them in a twinkling to wherever their presence was re
quired, the multiplication of the inferior animals was kept within
due limits, and decomposing matter was recalled into the service
of organic life. Had these unpaid scavengers but struck work for a day, the plague, as Michelet puts it, would soon have become the
only inhabitant of the country. ^
1 See in LOismti the chapter-headed L Epuration. With his genius for history and poetry Michelet has well understood the sentiment which gave birth to these primitive forms of worship, forms which have too long provoked unjust contempt. The whole of this beautiful chapter should be read ; we shall only quote a few lines : " In America the law protects these public benefactors. Egyptian law does still
more for them— it respects them and loves them. Although they no longer enjoy their ancient worship, they receive the friendly hospitality of man as in the time of Pharaoh. If you ask an Egj-ptian fellah why he allows himself to be besieged

The worship of the hawk, the vulture, and the ibis, had, then,
preceded by many centuries that of the gods who correspond to

explain and to accept anything, even those things which at a later
epoch seemed nothing more than the grossest creations of popular
superstition. These objects of veneration were therefore enabled
to maintain their places by the side of the superior gods, to repre
sent them in written characters and in plastic creations, and,
in the latter case, to be blended
with the forms of man himself To
us, accustomed as we are to the
types created by Greek anthro
pomorphism, these figures are sur
prising ; but to the Egyptians they
seemed perfectly natural, for they
offered the characteristic features of
the animals which they had loved,
respected, and adored ever since
the birth of their civilization.
It is difficidt for us to see things
with the same eyes as the con
temporaries of Cheops or even of
Rameses ; to enter into their ideas
and sentiments so as to feel with
them and to think with their brains.
Let us attempt to do so for a
moment ; let us make one of those
intellectual efforts which are de
manded from the historian, and
we shall then understand how it
was, that the Egyptians were not offended by a combination of two
classes of forms which, to us, seem
so differently constituted and so
unequal in dignity. The deity
took the form of an animal and
revealed himself in it, just as he took
that of a man, or of a statue which
he was supposed to animate, and to which he was attached. In
one of his most curious and most penetrating essays, M. Maspero
explains that the sacred animal was—like the king, the son of
Amen ; like the statue fashioned by the hands of a sculptor— the
manifestation of tf.e deity, the strength and support of his life, his

in a word, his living statue.^
Egyptian art was, then, the faithful and skilful interpretation of
the ideas of the people. What the Egyptians wished to say, that
they did say with great clearness and a rare happiness of plastic
expression. To accuse them, as they have been sometimes
accused, of a want of taste, would be to form a very narrow
conception of art, to sin against both the method and the spirit of
modern criticism. This latter seeks for originality and admires it,
and all art which is at once powerful and sincere arouses its
interest. We do not, however.

The value of an artistic result is in proportion to the difficulty of
its achievement. The Greek sculptor had nothing beyond the
bodily form and the features of man with which to give a distinct
individuality to each god and goddess of his mythology ; he
was therefore obliged to make use of the most delicate and
subtle distinctions of feature and contour. This necessity was a
great incentive to perfection ; it drove him to study the human
form with a continuous energy which, unhappily for himself, was
not required of the Egyptian sculptor or painter.

68 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Art and religion have ever been so closely allied that it was
necessary that we should give some account of the original
characteristics of the Egyptian beliefs, but we shall make no
attempt to describe, or even to enumerate, the chief divinities of the
Egyptian pantheon ; such an attempt would be foreign to the
purposes which we have in view. We have, however, already mentioned most of the chief deities of Egypt, and we shall have
occasion to draw the attention of our readers to others, in speak
ing of the tombs and temples, the statues and bas-reliefs, of the country. Now, each of these gods began by being no more than
the local divinity of some particular nome or city. As a city grew
in importance, so did its peculiar god, and sometimes it came about
that both a dynasty of kings and a divinity were imposed upon
Egypt by the power of what we may call their native city. In the
course of time a number of successive deities thus held the
supreme place, each of whom preserved, even after his fall,
some of the dignity which he had acquired during his period
of supremacy.
The two first dynasties, the authors of Egyptian unity, had
their capital in the nome of Abydos, the nome which contained
the tomb of Osiris ; and it was in their reign that, from one end
to the other of the Nile valley, spread the worship of that god ;
of that Osiris who, with Isis, seemed to Herodotus to be the only deity whom all the Egyptians combined to adore. ^ Under the
following dynasties, whose capital was Memphis, Ptah rose into
the first place ; but, as if by a kind of compromise, his dignity
is combined with that of the great god of Abydos under the
names of Ptah- Osiris and Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. Toum, the chief
deity of Heliopolis, never rose above the second rank because
Heliopolis itself was neither a royal city nor even the birthplace
of any powerful dynasty. During all this period we hear nothing
of Amen, the local deity of Thebes ; his name is hardly to be
found upon any monument earlier than the eleventh dynasty, but,
with the rise of the Theban empire he began to be a conspicuous
figure in Egypt. During the domination of the Hyksos, their
national deity, Soutekh or Set, overshadowed the ancient divinities
of the soil ; but the final victory of Thebes under Ahmes I.
installed Amen as the national god, and we shall see hereafter
what magnificent temples were raised in his honour by the kings
1 Herodotus, ii. 42.



The Egyptian Religion and the Plastic Arts. 69
of the brilliant Theban dynasties. His successor would no doubt
have been Aten, the solar disc, had Tell-el-Amarna, the new capital of Amenophis IV., and the worship which was there
inaugurated, enjoyed a less ephemeral existence ; but Thebes and Amen soon regained their supremacy. Again, when the
Egyptian centre of gravity was transported to the Delta, the local
deities of the district, and especially Neith, conquered the first place
in the religious sentiments of the people. Under the Persians
they returned to Amen, as to the protector who could give back to the nation its former independence and power. Under the
Ptolemies, Horus and Hathor were in the ascendant, and later
still, under the Roman emperors, the worship of the I sis of Philae
became popular and was prolonged in that island sanctuary until
the sixth century of our era.
The movement of religious thought in Egypt was very different
from what we shall find in Greece. We find no frod, like that of
the Hellenes, whose pre-eminence dates back to the remote origin
of the Aryan race, a pre-eminence which was never menaced or questioned;^ we find no Zeus, no Jupiter, whose godhead was
conceived from ccntur)- to century in an ever larger and more
purified spirit, until at last it was defined in the famous hymn of
Cleanthe as that " which croverned all thinofs accordincr to law."
We ha\-e pointed out how greatly the Greek artists profited by
their efforts to endow the piety of their countrymen with an image
of this great and good being, which should be worthy of the
popular laith in him as the father of gods and men. The
Egyptian artist could find no such inspiration in a long succession
of gods, no one of whom succeeded in concentrating supreme power
in his hands. No such ideal existed for them as that which the
. popular conscience and the genius of the national poets created in
the lord of Olympus. Neither Thebes nor Sais could give birth
to a Phidias ; to an artist who should feel himself spurred on by
the work of all previous generations to produce a masterpiece in
which the highest religious conception, to which the intelligence of
the race had mounted bv slow defrrees, should be realized in
visible form.

§ 6. T/ia/ Egyptian Art did not escape the Law of Change, and
that its History may therefore be written.
It may be well, before embarking upon the study of Egyptian
architecture, sculpture, and painting, to dispel a prejudice which in
spite of recent discoveries still exists in some minds ; we mean, the
belief in the immobility of Egyptian art. This mistake is a
very ancient one. The Greeks were the first to make it, and they
transmitted their error to us. In regard to this we must cite the
famous passage of Plato ^ :— " Long ago they appear to have
recognized the very principle of which we are now speaking

that their young citizens must be habituated to forms and
strains of virtue. These they fixed, and exhibited patterns of
them in their temples ; and no painter or artist is allowed to
innovate upon them, or to leave the traditional forms and invent
new ones. To this day no alteration is allowed, either in these
arts or in music, at all. And you will find that their works
of art are painted or moulded in the same forms that they
had ten thousand years ago— (this is literally true and no exaggera
tion) — their ancient paintings and sculptures are not a whit
better or worse than the work of to-day, but are made with
just the same skill."
This strange assertion was long accepted without question even in
modern times. We need not go back to the archaeologists of the
last century, whose credulity is to be accounted for by their lack of
materials for the formation of a better judgment. In 1S28 in his
first lecture at the Bibliotheque Royale, Raoul-Rochette turned his
attention to Egypt. He had before his eyes, in the Parisian
museums and in the Description, de I Egypte, works which dated
from the finest periods of the Theban dynasties, although the still
more ancient monuments which now form the glory of the Boulak
Museum were not yet discovered ; he might have perceived and
pointed out the difference between the statues of Ousourtesen, Thothmes, and Rameses on the one hand, and those of the Sait
epoch ; still more should he have remarked upon the characteristics

which distinguish the monuments of independent Egypt from those which were erected under the Ptolemies and the Roman emperors. What he did say, however, and say with consummate
confidence was : " From the first of the Pharaohs to the last of the
Ptolemies, the art of t^gypt never varied." ^
Such crude notions as this can no longer be upheld. M.
Marriette protests in the following almost indignant terms against
certain utterances of M. Renan which seemed to him to imply the
same doctrine. " M. Renan loves'-^ to represent ancient Egypt as
a sort of China, walled in and fortified against the exterior world,
immovable, old even in its infancy, and arrived by a single spring
at a degree of civilization which it never surpassed. He
looks upon the country as a great plain, green indeed and fertile,
but without accidents of contour to break the monotony of the landscape. And yet Egypt had periods of grandeur and decadence
more marked than those of other countries. Her civilization went
through all the different phases ; it went through many complete
transformations, it had its sudden moments of brilliancy and its
epochs of eclipse. Its art was not so stationary as to prevent us
from writing its history. The influence of Egypt was felt from Mesopotamia to the equator. Thothmes, in a word, was no
Chinaman. Egypt perished because in attacking foreign nations
she provoked a reaction which was fatal to her." ^
Now that we are enabled to contrast the statues of the Ptolemaic
period with those of the pyramid builders, we find nothing
surprising in Mariette's language ; but even before these means of
study were open to us, criticism should have cast more than doubt
upon the assertions of Plato ; it should have appealed from a
theory which was at variance with all historical analogies to the
monuments themselves to tell the truth, to those monuments
which were best known and understood. Was it likely, was it
possible, that such a people as that which created these monu
ments, should remain for more than forty centuries unaffected by
the law of continual, even if almost insensible, change ?
' Coi/rs tfAri/uvwgie, 8\o. 1829, pp. 10, 11. This critic's ideas upon Egyptian art were both superficial and false. " Egyptian art," he says, " never attempted any realistic imitation." We even find sentences utterly devoid of meaning, such as, for instance, " The fundamental principle of Egyptian art was the absence of
art." (p. 12.) - See the Rente des Deux Mondes of April i, 1865. ^ Voyage dans la Haute Egypte, \ol. i.



72 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
What right have we thus to place Egypt and China apart from the rest of humanity ? There are, it is true, some peoples who are
more attached than others to traditional customs and ancient
institutions ; they are more conservative, to use the modern phrase.
But, although their evolution is a slower process, it is there ; our
eyes cannot perceive any movement in the small hand of a watch,
but yet it does move exactly in the same. fashion as that which marks the seconds. Upon the banks of the Peiho as upon those
of the Nile, upon the whole surface of our planet, man is not ; he
decomcs, to borrow one of the favourite expressions of German
philosophy. History can admit no exception to this law either
for China or Egypt. In the cases of both those countries there is
a certain illusion, which is to be explained by our ignorance. We
are not well enough acquainted with them to grasp the different
periods of their political and social, their artistic and literary
development. For one who is too far off or very short-sighted
the details of the most varied landscape become obliterated or
confused ; waste land and smiling fields are blended together ;
hollows and hillocks lose the vioour of their contours.
China, as we have said, does not enter into our purview ; and
as for Egypt, the deeper we penetrate into her history the more
are we convinced that her long career was troubled by moments
of crisis similar to those which have come to other human
societies. The narratives of the Greek historians give us reason
to suspect that it was so, and the monuments which have been
discovered insist upon the same truth, and compel us to accept
it. For certain epochs these are very abundant, beautiful, and
varied. Afterwards they become rare and clumsy, or altogether
wanting ; and again they reappear in great numbers and in their
full nobilitj', but with a different general character. These
contrasts and temporary eclipses occur again and again. How,
then, can we doubt that here, as elsewhere, there were alter
nations of grandeur and poverty, of periods of conquest and
expansion and epochs of civil war or of defeat by foreign in
vaders ? May we not believe that through the clouds which
obscure the causes of such changes we may catch glimpses of
those periods of decadence and renascence which, following one
upon the other, exhausted in the end the genius of the race ?
Let us take a single example—the most striking of all. " After

look upon the ages which rolled away between the fall of Graeco
Roman civilization and the revival of learning in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries as no longer than that which divided the
ancient from tlie middle empire of Egypt, or the latter from the
dynasties of Thebes. In the distant future men will know, in a
vague fashion, that between the fall of Rome and the discovery
of printing, or that of America, there were great movements
among the nations, and an apparent recoil of civilization ; but
memory and imagination will leap without effort over the gap. over that period which we call the Middle Ages. The Roman

empire will seem to touch our modern civilization, and many of
the differences which strike us so strongly will be imperceptible.
They will perceive that we had a new religion and new inven
tions, but they will take more account of the resemblances than
of the differences. Our languages, manners, laws, and forms of
government will seem to them continuations of those of Greece
and Rome. In that which we call antiquity, and in Christian
Europe, they will find similar literary habits and standards of
criticism, the same judicial nomenclature, the same tenns for

Ctesars. These different civilizations are like star clusters. To
us who are among them they seem distinct enough, but to gene
rations which are divided from them by a vast space of time they
will seem to form but one nebulous body. Egypt, then, had her great convulsions like the rest of the
world. She met with disasters, and underwent periods of con
fusion like those which overtook the nations of the West between
the reigns of Trajan and
Charlemagne. Wars and
invasions, the action and
reaction of civilization, had
upon her the same influence
as upon them, and, in trans
forming her sentiments and
ideas, caused their plastic
expression to pass through
a series of changes in taste and style. The Theban tomb of the time of Rameses
is very different from that of
Memphis and the ancient
empire ; the new empire con
structed no buildings like
the greater pyramids, but
its temples were larger and
more magnificent than any
of their predecessors. It
was the same with sculpture.
A cultivated eye has no
need to run to inscriptions
to enable it to distinguish
between works of the ancient and of the middle empire ; nor will it confound works
created in either of those periods with those of the Sait
epoch. The differences are almost as well marked as those
which enable archai-ologists to distinguish a torso of the time ot
Phidias from one of the school of Praxiteles or Lysippus.
These differences it will be our duty to describe hereafter,
but our readers may perhaps discover them for themselves

if they examine the illustrations to this chapter, which are
arranged in chronological order.
Variety is universal in
Egypt, local variety as well
as that of different periods.
Language had its dialects as
well as art. The pronuncia
tion of Upper and that of Lower Eg)pt was quite
dissimilar, except in the case
of a few letters. In the
same way different cities
had distinct schools of sculp
ture and painting, which
were distinguished from one
another by their traditional
methods of conception and execution. Neither under Ousourtesen nor under Rameses, had art the same
character in the cities of the Delta, in Memphis, and in Thebes. Among the works
in sculpture executed for
Rameses II., those of Abydos were more elegant
and refined than those of
Thebes.
How, then, are we to
explain the error committed
by Plato, and by him trans
mitted to posterity ? The
explanation is easy. The Greeks visited Egypt too
late in its history to form a
true judgment. In Plato's time the Egyptians were still
by violent but spasmodic efforts, to reconquer the indepen
dence which had been destroyed by the successor of Cyrus. But
the moment was at hand when even these intermittent struggles

were to be abandoned, and they were to finally succumb to
sovereigns of foreign blocd. Their still brilliant civilization might
deceive a passing stranger, but the decadence had commenced

a decadence slow indeed, but none the more remediable.
Some years after the visit of Plato, the two Nectanebos,
more especially the second, devoted themselves with energetic
ardour to the restoration of the ancient buildings of the country
and to the construction of new ones, such as the temple at Philee. Buildings signed with their name are to be found all
over Egypt ; but these simultaneous undertakings seem to
betray a sense of vanishing" power, an uncertainty of the
morrow, a feverish activity seeking to deceive itself and to
hide its own weakness. Nothing could be more precarious than
the political conditions under which this activity was displayed.
The independence of the country was maintained by the dearly bought services of Spartan and Athenian mercenaries. Twice already had Persia crushed Egyptian revolts, and she was,
perhaps, but watching her opportunity to cast the hordes of Asia
upon the unhappy country for a third time. Ill obeyed as he was,
the " Great King " could always find troops to take part in the
spoiling of a country whose riches had proved so inexhaustible.
And if, by any remote chance, the Persians should fail in their enterprise, another and a graver danger would menace the Egyptian monarchy from the rapid growth of the Greek power
in the Mediterranean. Since the period of the Persian wars,
the language, the literature, the arts, the mythology of Greece,
had spread with great rapidity ; and the moment might be foreseen
when a supremacy founded upon intellectual worth would be
confirmed by military triumph and the creation of a vast Hellenic empire. The conquest of Egypt was begun by the Ionian
soldiers and merchants who were introduced into the Nile valley
by Psemethek ; it was bloodlessly completed by the arms of
Alexander. For three centuries the Egyptians had been accus
tomed to see the Greeks freely coming and going among them
as merchants, as mercenary officers, as travellers eager for
instruction. The latter posed as disciples before the priests of
Memphis and Heliopolis, and freely expressed a warmth of admira
tion which could not fail to Hatter the national vanity. The Greeks
would be better masters than their rivals from Persia. From them
the t.gyptians would, at least, obtain good administration and com

plete freedom in the exercise of their religion in return for their
taxes. The Greeks \vere clear-sighted enough to understand their
own interests ; they were too philosophical and large minded for
any fanatical persecution of, or even hindrance to, the national
religion ; they were too much of connoisseurs to fail in respect
to a form of civilization whose j^rodigious antiquity they divined,
and before which the most eminent among them were ever inclined
to bow, like youths before an old man, or a i^arvenu before the
descendant of a long line of kings.
Thus Egypt gradually fell into the hands of strangers after the
commencement of the fourth century before Christ. Ethiopians,
Assyrians and Persians had by turns overrun the country. Great
numbers of the Phoenicians had established themselves in it, and,
after the fall of Jerusalem and .Samaria, many Jews followed their example. Finally, the Greeks came in by thousands through
the breaches which their predecessors had made, penetrating into
all parts, and making everywhere felt the superiority of a people
who had, by appropriating the useful results obtained in a long
succession of centuries by more ancient races, become wealthier,
strono-er, and better instructed than any of their forerunners.
Thus Egypt lost her power of national rejuvenation, her power
of rising again after calamity. She existed on through the centu
ries by mere force of habit, but she lived no more. Her population
was so homoeeneous, and her Institutions were so solid, that the
social conditions of the country could not be changed in a day
or even in a century. The teachings of her religion had been
established by so long a course of development, and the hands of
her artists were so well practised, that the monumental types which
had been created in more fertile periods of her history were
reproduced until a late date, in a machine like and instinctive
fashion. Imagination was dead, and the best that could be hoped
for was the faithful repetition of those forms which the genius of
the race had conceived in its last moments of original thought. Under the Salt princes, under the Psemethcks and Nekau,
under Apries and Amasis, Egypt was delivered from her enemies
and again became mistress of Syria and of the Island of Cyprus. She
thus recovered confidence in herself and in her future, and a period
ensued which had an art of its own with distinctive features
which we shall endeavour to trace. In the intervals of pre
carious repose which characterized the Persian domination, the

Egyptians had leisure neither to invent nor to improve. They
copied, as well as they could, the monuments of the twenty-sixth
dynasty. Art became a mere collection of technical precepts, kept
together and transmitted in the intercourse of the studio, by
instruction and practice; it became a mere matter of routine

implying, perhaps, great technical skill, l»ut displaying no sincere

staiues required of them after the traditional recipes. Thus
Egyptian art became conventional, and so it remained to the end.
So it was in the time of Diodorus. The sculptors whom that
historian saw at work in Memphis and Thebes, during the reign of Augustus, carved a statue as a modern mechanic would make the different parts of a machine ; they worked with a rapidity and an
easy decision more characteristic of the precise workman than
of the artist.^ Thought was no longer necessary to them. The due proportions and measurements had been ascertained and fi.xed
many centuries before their time.
But research must still precede discovery. We admit that a
day arrived when convention was supreme in Egyptian art, but
it could not have begun with convention any more than the arts
of other nations. We must here define the terms which we shall
have occasion to employ. Every work of art is an interpretation
of nature. Let us take the example of the human figure. In the
works of a single period and of a single people, it is always full
of striking similarity ; and yet two original artists never look at it
with the same eyes. One will look at it in certain aspects and
will bring out certain qualities, which another, although his con
temporary and fellow-countryman, will leave in the obscurity of
shadows. One will devote himself to the beauty of form, another
to the accidents of colour or the expression of passion and thought.
The original remains the same, although its interpretations are
so various. And these varieties become still more marked when
we compare the arts of difterent races or of different periods—the
art of Egypt with that of Assyria or Greece, antique art
with that of modern times.
On the other hand, the great resemblance which the arts of
a single time and country bear to each other, is accounted for by
the fact that their creators look upon the external facts of life
through a glass, if we may put it so, tinted with the colours of the
national eenius. Thev brinsf to their study of an eternal model
the same transient prejudices, the same preoccupations, the same
desires. And yet among those highly gifted races where art
holds or has held a lofty place, groups of artists are formed,
either successively or simultaneously, which we call schools.
Each of these groups professes to make a fresh reference to
nature, to interpret her works more faithfully than its pre
' Diodorus, i. 98, 7, 8.

decessors, and to draw from them typical forms which shall be
more expressive of the real desires and sentiments of the public
for which it caters. Between the works of these different schools,
there are, however, many similarities, which are to be explained by
the indentity of race and belief. There are also diversities which
are caused either by different conditions or by the influence of
some master spirit. Wherever these schools spring up, art lives,
moves, and progresses. But sooner or later comes a time when
Fig. 52. — Sculptor at work upon nn arm, Thebes. (Chauipollion, pi. iSo.
)
this ardour comes to an end, and exhaustion takes its place.
The civilization to which it belongs becomes old and languid, and
its creative power ceases like the imperceptible sinking of a flood.
Now, it often happens that just before this period of lassitude,
in the last days of reproductive strength and healthy maturity,
a rich and brilliant school springs up, which interprets the
characteristic sentiments of the civilization to which it belongs,
with the greatest vigour and by admirably selected means. If
such an interpretation be found satisfactory at all points, why
VOL. I. M



82 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
should a better be sought for at the risk of choosing a worse ?
This question is but a confession of impotence on the part of those who ask it. From that moment convention will be supreme,
and convention in the sense of an artificial set of rules which
will release the artist from his obligation of continual reference
to nature.
Such a revolution is not the work of a day. Art requires time
thus to inclose itself in mere mechanical dexterity. As a nation
grows old, its art, like its literature, continually becomes more and
more conventional. Every great period or school leaves to the
generations that come after it types which have made a vivid
impression upon taste and imagination. As time goes on these
types become more numerous and more brilliant, and their prestige
increases until it becomes little less than tyranny. Society can
only escape from its thrall at the expense of some great religious
or philosophical revolution, or by the infusion of new blood
from without. And these changes western civilization had to
undergo in the early centuries of our era, in the establishment
of Christianity, the invasion of the barbarians, and the fall of
the Roman Empire.
Thanks to the peculiar circumstances of the country, Egyptian
society was enabled to maintain the originality of its genius and
the vitality of its institutions with unusual success. After each
period of internal commotion or foreign invasion, the Egyptians
set themselves to renew the chain of their national traditions.
In spite of the foreign elements which had been received among them, the great mass of the people remained the same down
to the latest days of antiquity. Heterogeneous constituents were
absorbed by the nation without leaving any apparent trace. The
ideas which the people had formed for themselves of the ultimate
destiny of humanity were developed, indeed, and in successive
acres varied sliehtlv in cjeneral colour, but in none of their
variations did they give rise to a new religion, as Brahmanism
eave birth to Buddhism. As often as a new dynasty of kings succeeded in driving out
the foreign conqueror and in re-establishing the unity of the
kingdom, so often was there a complete restoration. The aim
which they had in view was ever to restore, in all its parts, a
regime which was founded upon national pride. Enjoying a
civilization which for aees had been alone in the world, it was in



Change Observablp: in Egyptian Art. 83
its full and glorious past that Egyptian society found the ideal to
which it clung in spite of all obstacles and misfortunes. Its gaze was turned backwards towards those early sovereigns who seemed
transfigured by distance, but whose presence in the memory kept
alive the perpetual worship which had been vowed to them.
Every restoration is inspired by a more or less blind and
superstitious reverence for the past. This has often been asserted
in connection with politics and religion, and the assertion is
Fit;. 53. — Sculptor carving n statue, Thebes. (Champollion, pi. iSo.)
equally true in respect to art. Each of those dynasties to
which Egypt owed its political restoration, set themselves to
repair the temples which had been destroyed, and to replace
upon their pedestals the statues of gods or ancestors which had been overthrown. When new temples and new statues were
to be erected, the first idea of the artists employed was to study
the ancient monuments and to try to equal thein. As long as
Egypt preserved her vitality, the wants of the present and
external influences no doubt had their effect in introducine



84 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
certain changes, both in the arrangement of her buildings, and in the modelHng, movement, and expression of the statues which
adorned them. Ancient types were not servilely copied, but the
temptation to borrow from them a point of departure, at least,
for new attempts at progression, was too strong to be resisted.
It was necessary that all buildings and statues should be in
harmony with the remains which subsisted from previous ages,
and from this it resulted that each new creative effort began by
imitating what had gone before. The ' school ' in process of
foundation accepted on trust the architectural disposition left by
its predecessor, as well as its methods of looking at nature. And
this is equivalent to saying that, from its first moment, it must
have been conventional in a certain degree.
This conventionality must have increased at every fresh
renascence, because each new development had its own processes
to transmit to posterity as well as those of its ancestors. After
each recoil or pause in the progress of art, the weight of the past must have seemed heavier to those who attempted to revive the onward movement. On the one hand, the more ancient of the
traditional elements had acquired, by their constant and often
repeated transmission, a prestige and authority which placed them
above discussion ; on the other, the legacy of admitted princi
ples and processes was continually increasing, until it became a
source of embarrassment to the artist, and of destruction to his
liberty. When at last the decadence of the race had advanced so
far that all initiative power and independence of thought had dis
appeared, the time arrived when convention was everything, like
one of those elaborate rituals which regulate every word, and even
gesture, of the officiating priest. When Plato visited Egypt, the
schools of sculpture were nothing more than institutions for teach
ing pupils, who were remarkable for docility and for dexterity of
hand, to transmit to their successors an assemblage of precepts and receipts which provided for every contingency and left no
room for the exercise of fancy or discretion.
At that very time Greek art was progressing with a power and
rapidity which has never been rivalled. To the school of Phidias,
a school established in that Athens which yet possessed so many
works of the archaic period, had succeeded those of Praxiteles
and Scopas. The Greeks found means to improve, or at least to
innovate, upon perfection itself. Plato did not, and could not.

perceive, in his hasty journey through the Egyptian cities, that
they too had seen their periods of change, their difterent schools
and developments of style, less marked, perhaps, than those of
Greece, and certainly less rapid, but yet quite perceptible to the
practised observer. We are now in a better position to estimate
these differences. Monuments have been brought before our eyes
such as Plato never saw ; namely, the statues of the ancient
empire which were hidden for so many ages in the thickness of
Fig. 54. —Artist painting a statue, Thebes. (Champollion, pi. iSo.)
walls or in the depths of sepulchral pits. Even now these statues
have not reached the age of ten thousand years so persistently
attributed by the Greek philosopher to the early works which he
did see, works which seemed to him exactly the same as those
which were being made in his presence. But although the statues
of the early empire were then no more than some thirty centuries
old, Plato could not have helped seeing, if he had seen them at all,
that they were quite distinct from the works which the sculptors of



86 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Nectanebo had in progress, always supposing that he looked at
them with reasonable attention. The art of the pyramid builders,
an art which possesses in a very high degree certain qualities for
which the Egyptians have been too commonly refused credit, is
known to us chiefly through the excavations of Mariette and the
contents of the Boulak museum. But even before Cheops,
Chefren, and their subjects had risen from their tombs, the
historian might have divined by analogy, and described by no very
bold conjecture, the essential charateristics of Egyptian art during
its first centuries. Whether we speak of an individual, of a
school, or of a people, every artistic career which follows its
natural course and is not rudely broken through, ends sooner or
later in conventionality, in that which is technically called viamicrisni. But mannerism is never the beginning of art. Art always begins by humble and sincere attempts to render what it sees. Its awkwardness is at first extreme and its power of
imitation very imperfect. But it is not discouraged : it tries
different processes ; it takes account now of one, now of another
aspect of life ; it consults nature incessantly and humbly, taking
note of her answers and modifying its work in obedience to their
teaching. This teaching is not always rightly understood, but it
is ever received with docility and good faith.
Every work which bears the marks of frank and loyal effort is
interesting ; but the moment in an artistic career which gives birth
to real chefs d'ceiivre is towards the end of that period, when the
eye has become sure, and the hand sufficiently well practised, for
the faithful interpretation of any model whose beauty or original
expression may have caught the fancy. Success is then achieved,
always provided that the model is never lost sight of or studied
with anything short of passionate devotion. But the time comes
when this devotion is relaxed. The artist thinks that such con
stant reference to nature is no longer required when he has made
his final choice between the different methods which his art
employs. In devoting himself to the reproduction of certain
features for which he has a marked preference, he has himself
produced types which he thenceforward takes pleasure in repeating,
as if they were in themselves an epitome of nature's infinite
diversity.
In the case of Egypt, even those discoveries which carry us
back farthest do not enable us to grasp, as we can in the case of

The Monuments of the Memphite Period. 89
Greece, the first attempts at plastic expression, the first rude efforts
of the modeller or painter ; but they carry us to the end of that
period which, in the case of other countries, we call archaic ; and
above all they transport us into the centre of the epoch which was
to Egypt what the fifth century was to Greece, namely, the age of
perfection. The Egyptian people had already lived so long and
worked so hard that they could not free their work from certain
common and irrepressible characteristics. In the plastic acts and
in poetry they had their own style, and that style was both indi
vidual and original in an extraordinary degree. This style was
already formed, but it was not yet robbed of its vitality by indolent
content or petrified by mannerism ; it had neither renounced its
freedom nor said its last word.
§ 7. Of tlic place held in this zuoi'/c by the iiuvuiiiienls of Ihe
Jllcniphile period, and of the limits of our inquiry.
It will be found that a very large space in the present work,
some may say too large a space, is devoted to the pre-conventional
art of the ancient empire. We had reasons for taking such a
course, and reasons that may be easily divined.
This early art is much less known than that of the later epochs.
While the great museums of Europe are filled with statues and
reliefs from Thebes, or, at least, contemporary with the Theban
and Sait dynasties, monuments from the Memphite period are
still rare out of Egypt. Thanks to Mariette and Lepsius, Paris
and Berlin are not without remarkable examples of the art in
question, but it is in Egypt itself, at the Boulak museum, that any
detailed study must be made. It is there that the masterpieces of an art whose very existence was unsuspected by Champollion, are
to be found ; the Chephren, the two statues from Meidoum, the
bas-reliefs from the tomb of Ti, and many others of similar style
and value. These figures have been drawn for our readers by two
skilful artists, MM. Bourgoin and Benedite. They have rendered
with fidelity and sincerity more than one object which had never
before been reproduced, either by photography or otherwise. A few specimens of these treasures, selected by him who had been the means of brineinc them to lieht and whom we now mourn,
were seen at the Universal Exhibitions of 1867 and 1878, but

they soon returned to Cairo, and western archseologists had but
slight opportunity to become acquainted with their characteristics.
The art of the early dynasties has thus been practically ignored
by those who have never visited Egypt. The lifelike and en
thusiastic descriptions of M. Eugene Melchior de Vogiie and
others have done something to arouse the attention of connoiseurs ;
but in such a matter the slightest sketch, provided it be correct so
far as it goes, is of more value, as a definition of style, than the
most picturesque or eloquent writing.
These reflections would by themselves justify our efforts to in
corporate in our pages, reproductions of
all the more important objects with which
the necropolis at Memphis has enriched the museum at Boulak ; but we were
impelled by other motives also. The
extant monuments of the ancient empire
are less numerous than those of the
Theban and Salt dynasties ; they are of
comparatively modest dimensions, and,
with rare exceptions they all belong to
one category, that of works relating to
death and burial. They also have a
special interest of their own. They enable
us to protest, and to give tangible justifi
cation for our protestations, against a
prejudice which dates back to a remote antiquity ; even if all evidence had perished
the critic would have no great difficulty
in casting doubt upon assertions which
were in themselves extremely improbable,
but his task is rendered much easier when
he is able to point to existing monuments in support of his
contention, and his pleasure is great in seeing the certainty
of his critical methods borne out, and Egyptian art replacing
itself, as if of its own motion, under the normal conditions of
historic development. This volume, then, will treat of the remains of early Egyptian
art at a length which would seem at first sight out of due pro
portion to their number, but later ages will also be represented by a series of monuments, which will bring us down to the Persian

The Limits of our Inquiry. 91
conquest. This limit will hardly be over-passed in our choice of
examples for study, and that for two reasons.
The first is, that at the latter period the evolution of Egyptian
art was complete, it had created all that it could and had become
a slave to its own past. Disposing under the Ptolemies of
all the resources of a great empire, it indeed introduced certain
architectural changes w^hich do not seem to have been borrowed
from previous buildings, but those changes were of no very great
importance and were mostly in matters of detail. In sculpture

and painting we can easily see that it abandoned itself to mere
copying, to the repetition of a lesson learnt by rote. Whatever had to be done, was done in accordance with fixed tradition, and
one monument only differed from another in the amount of care and manual dexterity bestowed upon it. Our second reason is this, that Egypt was opened to the Greeks
in the time of the Salt princes. From the year 650 B.C. onwards,
there w'as constant communication between Ionia and the cities of



92 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
the Delta. If at any time Greek art borrowed directly from that
of Egypt, it was during the second half of the seventh century
and the first half of the sixth. By the end of the sixth century,
it had become so original and so skilful in the management of its
selected methods of expression that it could not have been very
receptive to foreign influences. After the Persian wars such in
fluences would be still more powerless. In the Ptolemaic era the
state of things was reversed ; Greece imposed her language, her
literature, her religious conceptions and their visible symbols upon
the whole eastern world. Even then the art of Egypt could de
fend, and even perpetuate itself, by the power of custom and of a
tradition which had been handed down through so many centuries,
but the day was past when it could provoke imitation. As for the indirect borrowings of forms and motives which
Greece received from Egypt through the Phoenicians, their trans
mission had come to an end before the Persian conquest, even
before the time of Psemethek. Egypt was represented, either
immediately or through the imitative powers of the Syrian manu
facturers, in the first textiles, jewels, and vases of clay or metal,
carried by the Sidonian merchants to the savage ancestors of the Greeks. In this roundabout manner she had probably more in
fluence over Greece than in their periods of more direct commu
nication. The rays kindled upon her hearth, the earliest of civili
zation, fell upon the Hellenic isles as refracted rays, after passing
through the varied media of Chaldeea, Assyria or Phoenicia.
Thus if we wish thoroughly to understand Greece, we must start from Memphis and go through Babylon and Nineveh, Tyre and Sidon. But Greece will be the aim of our voyage, and Egypt will
interest us less on her own account than on account of that unique
and unrivalled people who inherited her inventions and discoveries,
and made them the foundation for a productiveness in which are
summarized all the useful labours of antiquity. Egyptian art will
be followed by us down to the moment in which it lost its creative
force and with it its prestige. We shall rarely have occasion to
speak of the Ptolemaic remains of Egyptian art. Now and then
we shall go to them for examples when any particular detail which we desire to mention has not been preserved ior us by earlier monuments, but even then we shall require to have good reasons
for believing that such detail did in fact originate in the creative
periods of the national history.



The Limits of our Inquiry. 93
The Eg)q3t of the Pharaohs has not even yet been entirely
explored. Are we to believe that the splendid edifices reared in
the cities of the Delta, and especially at Sais, by the twenty-sixth
dynasty, have perished to the last stone ? We are loth to think
that it is so, but no remains have yet been discovered. Some
day, perhaps, well directed excavations may bring to light the
temples which Herodotus so greatly admired ; and who knows
but that we may find in them more than one of those motives and arrangements which at present are only known to exist in the
buildings of the Ptolemies and of the Roman emperors ?

CHAPTER II.
PRINCIPLES AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE.
I.

Method to be Employed by its in our Study of this Architecture.
In the enterprise which we have undertaken the study of oriental
art is but an introduction to that of Greece. Without an attentive
examination of its remains we should be unable to distinguish the
original elements in the work of the Greek genius from those
which it borrowed from other nations. We must pass in review
the whole artistic production of several great nations who occupied
a vast surface of the globe, and whose fertility was prolonged
throueh a lone course of centuries, but we shall not attempt to
describe singly the great buildings of Egypt and Assyria, of Persia
and Phoenicia, as such an attempt would perhaps cause us to lose
sight of the main object of our work.
Our task is no easy one. While limiting our study in the
fashion which has been described, we must not fail to extend
our purview to every fact which may help to justify the comparison
which we propose to institute between the arts of Greece and
those of the nations by whose teachings she profited. There is
but one road to success in this double task. We must devote the
greatest possible care to our study of the details in question, and
then give the general results of that study ; we must make our
selves thoroughly acquainted with all the phenomena, but must
confine our exposition to the general laws which governed them,
such as our minute inquiries have presented them to us. No
circumstantial description need, therefore, be looked for in these pages even in the case of the most important and famous buildings of Egypt. No monograph upon any tomb or temple will be found, but we shall ourselves have examined many tombs and



Our Method in the Study of this Architecture. 95
temples ; we shall, to speak figuratively, have taken them to pieces, and by means of the knowledge acquired we shall endeavour to make our readers acquainted with the notions of the Egyptians
upon sepulchral and religious architecture, and with the changes
which those conceptions underwent in the course of centuries.
Thus, for example, we have explored the pages of Lepsius ^ and
Prisse d'Avennes ' for information relating to the sepulchres of the
first six dynasties, and further researches have been made on the
spot expressly for the present work, but we shall not give any
descriptions or illustrations of those works individually ; we shall
merely use them for an ideal restoration of the characteristic tomb
house of the ancient empire. We may, perhaps, for this purpose,
make a more particular reference to one or two sepulchres which
are in unusually good preservation, but only for the sake of giving
firm definition to the type and to its main variations.
By this analytical method of treatment we shall be enabled to
give an account, which shall be at once accurate and not too long,
of the constructive processes employed by the Egyptians, of the
general aspect of their buildings, and of the modifications enforced
by the decorative forms of which they made use. We shall be
enabled to see how far those forms were decided by natural
conditions, by ancient tradition, or by special wants. We shall
thus include in a single chapter all that relates to principal or
accessory openings, to doors and their construction, to those loftily
placed windows which were calculated to give so little light. In
another chapter we shall discuss the column and its capital ; we
shall describe the variations produced by time and materials upon
its proportions and its entasis. Each assertion will be justified by
reference to characteristic examples. In this matter our only

(i vol. 4to.), published after the death of Prisse, has this great inconvenience, that it is not always easy to distinguish what belongs to the editor, M. jMarchandon de la Faye, from the contributions of Prisse, who was one of the most practical and experienced of egyptologists. The papers, sketches, and drawings left by Prisse became the property, in 1880, of the Bibliotheque Nationale ; when they are classified and published we shall probably find among them several interesting documents : we have only been able hurriedly to look through them, when the illustrations to this work were already prepared. It is desirable that a complete inventory of these collections should be made as soon as possible.

difficulty will be an einbarras cie richesse, a difficulty of choice
among the vast number of remains still existing of ancient Egypt
from the time of Menes to that of the Persian conquest.
In order to avoid repetition and to put before the reader ideas
which he will have no difficulty in assimilating, we shall push our
work of analysis and generalization farther still. Before we
embark upon the study of any special class of buildings we shall
endeavour to define the general and unchanging characteristics
of Egyptian architecture as a whole ; characteristics which were
fixed by the idiosyncracy of the race, by its beliefs and social
customs, by the nature of the climate, and of the materials of
which the architect could dispose. We shall do the same for
Assyria and Chaldaea, for Persia and Phoenicia, for each, indeed,
of the nationalities which are to be considered in our history.
These theoretical chapters will be illustrated in the same fashion
as the others, except that the illustrations will partake of the
generalized and abstract character of the text which they accom
pany. In most cases they will be simple diagrams composed for
the express purpose of illustrating the definitions or descriptions
to which they belong. They will each refer to some essential
element in the national architecture, to some element which is
not peculiar to any one edifice more than another, but is to be
found in all those which have similar aims and are constructed of
the same materials. Such elements are above and outside such
accidental variations as may be found in details of plan or
ornament ; they form part of the substantial inner constitution of
the arts of Egypt and Chaklrea, and make their originality
indisputable.
§ 2. — General Priueiples of Form.
The external forms of Egyptian edifices are pyramieioid ; in
other words, the outward surfaces of their walls affect the form of
a trapezium. Thus if we prolong these surfaces vertically we find
that they unite at last in a point, in the case of square buildings
(Fig. 58), and in a ridge in those which are oblong in plan
(Fig. 59).^ A square building will sometimes end in a ridge, or

arete, when the principal facade and the corresponding one in its
rear are vertical, the other two being- inclined.
Horizontal lines piedominate over inclined or vertical lines, and
buildings, therefore, tend to develop in length and depth rather
than in height. To this general rule, however, the pylons afford
exceptions.

The terminations of their edifices were also horizontal. There
w'as no necessity for sloping roofs, as, away from the immediate
proximity of the sea, it hardly ever rains in Egypt. Moreover,
the natural conformation of the country had its influence upon
the creations of its inhabitants. The unforeseen and sudden
variations, the contrasts of hill and plain, which we find in a

Egypt is a verdant plain, intersected by canals, and stretchinc^

by two long chains of hills, the Arab chain and the Libyan, whose summits form an almost unbroken line. Between these aspects

of nature and the works of man which they enframe, there is
a striking general sympathy.^
The pecuHar character of Egyptian architecture is owing to
its laternal extension, and to those wide-spreading bases and
foundations which suggest the incHnation of the superincumbent
walls. In looking at one of these buildings, we feel that it is
capable of infinite extension horizontally, and that but one of its
dimensions, that of height, is limited by its essential forms.
These characteristics give a look of sturdy power to Egyptian

architecture which is peculiar to itself, and suggests an idea of
unbounded durability.^
1 Egyptian landscape is well characterised in these lines of M. Ch. Blaxc, taken from the Voyage de la Haute Egypte {\). 116): "Pour le moment, notre plaiser se borne k regarder un paysage simple, monotone, mais grand par sa simplicite' meme et par sa monotonie. Ces lignes planes qui s'allongent et se prolongent sans fin, et qui s'interrompent un instant pour reprendre encore leur niveau et se continuer encore, imprinient a la nature un caractere de tranquillite qui assoupit 1' invagination et qui apaise le coeur. Par une singularite peut-etre unique au monde, les varietes qui viennent rompre de distance en distance la vaste uniformity de la terre egyptienne se reproduisent toujours les memes." [We have refrained from translating this piece
of word painting, lest its suggestive rhythm should vanish in the process. — En.

- Similar notions are expressed by M. Ch. Blanc in his Granimaire des Arts dii Dessin (book i. ch. viii.). " The wide-spreading base is the distinguishing characteristic of the Egyptian monuments. Wall, pier, and column, all the constructive members of Egyptian architecture, are short and thick set. To add to this appearance of solidity the relative size of the base is increased by that tendency towards the pyramid which is to be found in every Egyptian building. The pyramids of Memphis, one of them the greatest building upon earth, stand upon enormous

An appearance of incomparable gravit)-, ot solemnity, is also
stamped upon it by the small number of openings ior the
admission of light of which it makes use, and also by their
arrangement. Compared to our modern architecture, in which
windows play such an important part, that of Egypt is prison
like in its gloom ; but, in consequence of its rare openings and
their small size, it presents more imposing walls than any
other style.
One of the essential arrangements of Egyptian architecture
is shared by many other countries, that of the portico, by which
we mean an alternation of voids and solids in certain well defined

a covered way, or for dividing the halls of the interior and

architecture is one of the most vital characteristics.
bases. Their height is far less tlian their largest horizontal diameter. The pyramid of Cheops, for instance, is 233 metres along one side of its base, and only 146 in height, i.e., its base is to its height as 8 to 5. All Egyptian monuments, even the most lofty, are more remarkable for the ground they cover than for their height [except the monoliths !

Ed.], and this extension of their bases gives them an appearance of absolutely eternal durabilitj-." ' This illustration has been compiled in order to give a general idea of the more persistent characteristics of the Egyptian temple.

In the case of Egypt this relation gives rise to the following remarks :

The proportional combinations of these elements are such that

art there is a vioduhis which determines the quantitative relation
of forms to each other, and fixes a mutual and invariable inter
dependence. This modulus is found in the diameter of the
column, and the standard of proportion which is based upon it
is called a canon. In Egypt, as in other countries, there must
have been a certain connection between the diameter of a column
and its height, but there was no approach to that rigid and immutable law which had its effect upon every detail of a Greek temple. The modulus, in Egyptian art, was used with such
freedom, and gave rise to such varied proportions, that we may say
that no canon existed. The elementary forms of an Egyptian

edifice had so little dependence upon the modulus that we need
not take it into consideration, and, in this sense, the art of
Eo-ypt was not mathematical, like that of Greece.
Finally, all Egyptian buildings are crowned by the same
entablature, an architrave and the moulding which is called the
Eo-yptian gorge (Fig. 67).^ An architectural member, the plain
quadrangular architrave, is invariably inserted between this
termination and the upper extremity of the voids and points
of support.
' We know but one or two exceptions to this rule. It will suffice to quote the Royal Pavilion of Medinet Abou, which is crowned by a row of battlements.

General Prixcitles of Construction'. — Materials.
^ 3. General Principles of Construction. — Materials.
In studying a natural architecture and in attempting to assign
reasons for its particular characteristics, many circumstances have
to be taken into consideration. The innate genius of the race,
the physical and moral conditions of its development, the perfection
of its civilization, the spirit of its religion, and the ardour of its
faith ; none of these must be forgotten, but some of them act in
such a complex fashion that they are extremely difficult to follow.
In its aspirations towards the infinite and the eternal, the
Egyptian religion raised from the surface of the earth many
buildings which varied as greatly in form and aspect as they did
in date and situation. The climatic conditions of the world have
changed but little since the beginning of the historic period, and
every nation has to take them into the first consideration in
deciding upon its own architectural forms and principles. We
have here a problem whose data do not vary, and yet its solutions have not always been the same even in a single country. Without
ever being absolutely incorrect, the)- attached themselves now to
one principle, now to another, and so gave much variety to the
appearance of successive buildings under one skv and destined for
similar uses.
As for the materials employed, we cannot go so far as to say
that their different properties absolutely determined the charac
teristics of Egyptian building in advance. Stone, the chief of all
materials, can lend itself to forms of great variety in principle ;
and so, too, can brick and wood. But although no material can
narrowly confine a skilful architect, there are, nevertheless, certain
systems and constructions which are only possible with those which
possess certain properties.
To give but a single example, neither the h}-po-style halls of
Egypt and Persepolis, nor the Greek temples, with their archi
traves resting upon widely spaced columns, with the coffered roofs
of their porticos, and their decorative and expressive sculpture, could
have been carried out in brick. In stone, or rather in marble,
alone, could the typical temple, such as the Parthenon, have been
realised ; without such a material the Greeks could never have
created that incomparable ensemble whose different parts are so



I04 A History of Art ix Ancient Euytt.
intimately allied one with another, in which the richest decoration
is in complete unity with the constructive forms which it accen
tuates and embellishes. Brick could never have led to the
invention or employment of these forms. Those who try to
imitate them in any such material have to make up for its
deficiencies by various ingenious devices. The joints between the
bricks have' to be hidden under stucco, the mouldings and carved

ornaments of stone have to be replaced, as in the temple of the
Deus Rediculus, by moulded terra cotta (Pig. 68). The result
is sometimes pleasing enough, especially by the surprise which it
causes. Santa Maria delle Grazie, at Milan, is a masterpiece of

its kind, thanks to the skill and tact displayed by Bramante in the
management of the burnt clay which was the only material
afforded him by the plains of Lombardy ; Ijut where Bramante
succeeded, less skilful artists have failed. They have demanded
effects from brick which it was unable to give, with a profound
discord between form and matter as a result.
Of all the causes which modiiy the forms of architecture and
determine its character, the most important is the nature, the
genius, if we may say so, of the materials used. So, before we
can arrive at a correct judgment of the rules and principles of any
style, we must begin by appreciating and describing the materials
of which it disposes. We never forget this in the case of
sculpture, still less should we do so in the case of architecture,
where the material is still more despotic.
The materials made use of by the Egyptians were granite,^
sandstone,- and limestone.'" A softer stone, namely alabaster, was
often employed for lining.''
Sandstone and limestone, especially the latter, are used nearly
everywhere ; granite is of less frequent occurrence and suggests an
important observation.
Granite is not a sedimentary, stratified rock hke limestone ; it
is a material compacted in great masses, to a depth or, to speak
more accurately, in a volume which is practically unlimited ; the
dimensions of the stones which may be cut from these masses are
therefore infinite to all intents and purposes.-''
The Egyptians also made use of both burnt and unburnt brick.
' The only granite quarries that were worked in antiquity were those of Syene now Assouan, in Upper Egypt, upon the right bank of the Nile. - Sandstone was chiefly obtained from two localities, Djebel-Alimar, near Cairo, and Djebel-Silsili in Upper Egypt. 3 The Arab Chain is almost entirely calcareous. Near the sites of all the ancient cities it shows numerous excavations bearing witness to the activity of tlie ancient builders. The most celebrated of these quarries is that at Mokattani, near Cairo. The stone of which the body of the pyramids is composed was drawn from it. * The alabaster quarries of to-day are all in the Arab Chain, between thesoutlieni slopes of the mountain Mahsarali, near Cairo, and the sjirings of the Wadv Siout, opposite the town of that name. ^ The obelisk of Queen Hatasu, at Karnak, is 105 ft. 8 in. higli ; the statue of Rameses II. at Thebes, on the left bank of the river, is a monolith 55 ft. 5 in. liigh, and weighing about 1,200 tons. [The obelisk which still remains at Syenc, never having been completely detached from the rock in which it was quarried, is nearly g6 ft. high and 11 ft. 1} in. diameter at its base.

The employment of these different materials gave birth to
what we may call '' dressed construction," that is, construction
ihe elements of which are squared upon each face and put into
close juxtaposition one with another.
Concrete or pise, compressed, as in the pylons, between moulds
or caissons of woodwork, was also made use of by the Egyptians.
This material gave rise to what we may call compact construction.
Again, although trees, except the palm, were rare enough in the
valley of the Nile, the Egyptians built also in wood, by which a
third kind of construction, called construction by assemblage, in which the elementary units were held together by being introduced
one into another, was obtained.
In a few buildings of the latter class metal seems to have been employed, sometimes in the construction, sometimes for lining, and sometimes for outward decoration.
^ 4.

Dressed Constrticiion.
The constructive elements which enter into the composition of
this first class of buildings are stone and brick.
In the first place, these elements are horizontal or vertical.
The horizontal elements constitute the planes, as they cover the
voids by horizontal superposition.
They consist of courses and architraves.
The courses form the walls. They are arranged in horizontal
bands, with vertical and sometimes sloping joints. The separate
stones are often bound together upon their horizontal surfaces by
dovetails or tenons of wood. The blocks made use of in this form
of construction are usually of large dimensions, but the Egyptians
also made use of small stones or rubble, lined on the exterior by
laree flat ones which concealed the meanness of the material
behind them.^ (Fig. 70.) Various peculiarities of construction which are comparatively
seldom met with will be noticed when we come to describe the monuments in which they are to be found. Architraves were stone beams used to bridge over the voids and

to support the covering of the building, which latter was composed
of long and heavy slabs. The vertical elements support the architraves and combine them
one with another. These vertical supports vary greatly in size.
Those of small or medium dimensions are monoliths ; others are

composed of many courses of stone one upon another, courses
which in this case take the name of di-nnis.
Upon exterior surfaces, supports take various forms of develop
ment which may all be referred to the type which we have defined,
namely, the portico. In the interiors the form of support is a
logical consequence of the material employed. Whenever the



io8 A History of Art in An'cient Egypt.
stones which form the roof are too 'small to bridge over the whole
of the space comprised within two walls, they must be made to rest
upon intermediate supports ; and this necessity springs up in every building of any importance. This very elementary com
bination fulfils all the re
quirements of circulation.
The number of supports
depends upon the number of rows of the flat stones which
form the roof. They are sometimes multiplied to such
an extent that they remind
us of that planting arrangement in our gardens which
we call a quincunx.
We cannot, however, affirm that the number of supports is
invariably decided by the length of the architraves, or of the roof
ing stones. -Some very long monoliths are supported at regular

intervals, lest they should break with their own weight or with that
put upon them. The walls, architraves, and vertical supports are
always far stronger than the mere weight of the roof would require.



Dressed Constructiox. 109
The following woodcut shows the arrangement of supports,
architraves and roof. These simple arrangements constitute a
complete system of construction which, belonging exclusively to
Egypt, has had results upon which we cannot too strongly insist.
Both roof and architraves being horizontal, all the pressure upon

the walls is vertical. There is no force tending to thrust the walls
outwards nor to affect the immobility of the supports.
Consequently, if the proportions of the vertical and horizontal
elements of a building, that is to say, its sections, have been skil
fully determined, there is in the building itself no latent cause of
disruption ; its equilibrium is perfect, and can only be destroyed



no A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
by external physical causes, by long exposure to the weather, by
earthquakes, or by the hand of man.'^ We see then that the first impression caused by the external
lines of the architectural monuments of Eg^'pt is confirmed and
explained by further study. They are built, as said the Pharaohs
themselves, " for eternity." Stability, in a word, in its highest
and most simple form is the distinguishing characteristic, the true
originality', of Egyptian architecture.
This character is most stronMv marked in stone buildings, but
it is by no means absent from those built of materials created by
human industry. Works in brick form the transition between the
construction that we have described and that which we call
compact. A stone roof is not often found, and the termination is
generally a terrace in which wood is the chief element. In some
cases the secondary parts of such edifices, and sometimes the
whole of them, are covered in by brick vaults, and maintained
bv walls of a suflicient thickness.
Although the use of monoliths for roofing purposes was general
in Egypt, it must not be thought that the architects of that country
were ignorant of the art of covering voids with materials of small
size, that is to say, of building vaults. There are numerous
examples of Egj-ptian vaults, some of them of great antiquity,
and, moreover, the Eg}-ptian builders constructed their vaults after
a method of their own. In spite of the facilities which they
afforded, they played, however, but a secondary role in the development of art. They were never used in the buildings to
which greater importance was attached ; they are introduced chiefly
in out-of-the-way corners of the building, and in the substructures of ereat monumental combinations. This method of construction, being confined within such narrow limits, never resulted in Egyp:
in an architectural system ; - neither did it give birth to any ot
those accessory forms which spring from its use.
- The vertical support and the architrave form the two vital elements of an Egyptian building, which is therefore enabled to dispense with those buttresses and other lateral supports which are necessary to give stability to the edifices of many
other nations. 2 We may here remark that the modest dwellings of the Egj-ptian fellah are often covered by vaults of pise, that is to say, of compressed and kneaded clay. None of the ancient monuments of Egypt possess such vaults, which are of much less durabihtj- than those of stone or brick. We are, however, disposed to believe that they were used in antique times.

Egyptian vaults may be divided into two great categories,
according to the method of their construction.
I. Off-set vaults. These vaults are
composed of courses off-set one from
another, and with their faces hollowed
to the segment of a circle. (Fig- 74-)
If the face of those stones which, in
the form of inverted steps, are turned to
the void which has to be
covered, be cut into the line
of a continuous curve, the
superficial appearance of a
sesrniental arch or barrel
vault will be obtained ; but
this appearance will be no
more than superficial, the
vault will be in fact a false
one, because, in such a con
struction, all the stones
which enframe the void and
offer to the eve the form

their lateral joints are vertical. (Fig. 76.) When the units
of such vaults are properly proportioned they are stable in themselves, and they have
no lateral thrust.

composed of voussoirs, whose
lateral joints are oblique, and
radiate towards one centre or
more. (Figs. "]], 78, and 79.)
This method of construction is very convenient because it
enables the builder to utilize constructive units of very small

dimensions, such as bricks. But this advantage has a corre
sponding drawback. These voussoirs thrust one against another

and tend towards disintegration. They are not stable in them
selves, and in order to give them stability they must be kept in place by surrounding them with opposing forces which will
effectually prevent their setting up any movement in the structure
of which they form a part. This function is fulfilled by the wall
in Egyptian architecture, which is consequently very thick, but the
radiating arch never arrived at such a development in Eg)pt as to
lead to the adoption of any contrivance specially charged with the
maintenance of vaults in a state of proper rigidity. The Egyptians
not only employed the semicircular arch ; they made use, in a few
instances, of the pointed form, and many of their underground
buildings have roots cut out of the rock in the form of a segmental
vault. The fact that these sepulchral chambers affected the aspect
of vaulted halls, can only be explained by the supposition that a
similar construction was common in the dwellings of the living.'
§ 5.

Compact CoiistnictioH.
The methods employed in what we may call compact constrnction
permit the use, in considerable quantities, of moulded clay mixed
with chopped straw. This material was used in buildings which were homogeneous ; it was poured into a mould formed by planks,
which was raised as the work progressed
and the mixture dried. But the material
had little strength, and was far inferior to
those modern concretes which have the
density and durability of the hardest stone. The Egyptians do not seem to have been
acquainted w'ith concrete proper, and un
burnt bricks did not differ essentially from
pise. Such bricks, when placed one upon
another after being imperfectly dried, combined, under the
influence of the weather and their own weight, into one homo
geneous mass so that the separate courses became undistinguish
able. This latter fact has been frequently noticed in Assyria, by
' Another explanation has been given of the employment of the vault in subterranean work. Marietta believed the arch to be symbolic, to signify the canopy of heaven, the heaven of Amen. One objection to this is the fact that the vault was not universal in tombs ; some of those at Beni Hassan have flat ceilings, others have coves.

those who had to cut through the thickness of walls in the process of excavation.
If voids have to be covered in pise, one of those self-supporting
curves which we have described under the name of vaults, must
be made use of, and the vault must be constructed over a centring of wood. But we have no
~\, evidence that the Egyptians
could carry the art of con
struction to this point in pise.
On the contrary, we have
good reason to believe that
they generally made use of
this material for the quiescent
body of the edifice alone,
and that voids were mostly covered with stone or wood. In a word, the Egyptians did
not carry the use of artificial
material far enough to form
a complete system based
upon it. They made great use of it, but only in a strictly limited
fashion. It is only found in certain well-defined parts of buildings,
which were never of any very great interest from an artistic point
of view (Fig. 80). It deserved to be mentioned, if only for the
frequency of its use in Egypt, in the private architecture of both
ancient and modern times (Fig. 81), but it need not detain us longer.

§ 6.

Coiistriution by Assemblage.
Carpentry, or construction by assemblage, played a considerable
part in ancient Egypt, but, as may easily be understood, few traces
of it are to be found in our day. Those edifices which were con
structed of wood have, of course, all perished ; but, in spite of their
disappearance, we can form a very good idea of their aspect and ot
the principles of their construction. In the most ancient epoch of
Egyptian art, the people took pleasure in copying, in their stone
buildings, the arrangements which had characterised their work in
wood ; besides which, their paintings and reliefs often represent



Construction by Assemblage. i i
building-s of the less durable material. The constructive principles
which we have next to notice, have thus left traces behind them
which will enable us to describe them with almost as much
accuracy as if the carpenters of Cheops and Rameses were working
before our eyes.
We need not insist upon the characteristics which distinguish
assembled construction from masonry or brickwork. The different
parts of the former are, of course, much more intimately allied
than in buildings constructed of large stones. Supports of dressed
stone truly fixed with the plumb line are perfectly stable of
themselves. In both Egypt and Greece we often come upon a few columns
still standing upright amid their desolate surroundings, and
announcing to the traveller the site of some city or famous temple
which has been long destroyed. But wooden supports ha\'e little
thickness in comparison with their height, and the material of
which they are formed, being far less dense than stone, cannot
maintain itself in place by its own weight. It is the same with
wooden architraves. The heaviest beams of wood will not keep
their places when simply laid one upon another, and are in that
matter far inferior to those well dressed stones which, in so
many ancient walls, have resisted change with neither tenons nor
cement to help them.
As a general principle, when wood has to be employed to the
best advantage, and endowed with all the solidity and resisting
power of which it is capable, the separate pieces must be introduced one into another (Fig. 82). But even when thus combined
and held in place by mt^chanic'al contrivances, such as bolts and
nails, they will never form a homogeneous and impenetrable mass
like brick or stone. By such methods an open structure is
obtained, the voids of which have afterwards to be filled up by
successive additions, and these additions often take the form of
what we call panels.
We may look upon the different faces of a wooden building as
separate pieces of construction which should be put together upon
the ground before being combined with each other. This pro
cess, though not always made use of in practice, is at least the
most logical method for those who wish to make the best use of
their materials. But even when thus put together, one of these
single faces has not much more stability than each of its constituent



ii6 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
elements. In order to form a rigid and stable whole, the several
faces must be allied by reciprocal interpenetration at the angles.
It was necessary to call attention once for all to these general
characteristics of wooden construction, because we shall hereafter
have occasion to examine the forms and motives which stone
architecture borrowed from wood in the case of other people
besides the Egyptians. We must now determine the particular
characteristics offered by the material in Egypt, as they may be
learnt in the representations to which we have already referred.
When a wall has to be built of wood so as neither to warp nor
give way, it is necessary to make use of a certain number of oblique

members. This is one of the elementary rules of the carpenter's
art, and to form an idea how it was applied in our own country it
is enough to cast an eye over any of the wooden buildings of the
middle ages or of the renaissance. The Egyptians were not ignorant
of the advantages conferred by the use of these oblique members
because they employed them frequently in their furniture ; but
they seem never to have introduced them into the construction of
their building.s. All joints are there made at a right angle. They
were probably led to reject oblique lines by their unwillingness to
break in upon the simple harmony of vertical and horizontal lines



Construction by Assemblage. 117
which is the distinguishing principle of all their architecture.
Thus self-deprived of a valuable resource, they were driven to the
discovery of some other means of giving the required cohesion and
stability to their walls. This requirement they thought they had
fulfilled in exaggerating the jaoints of connection between the vertical and horizontal members, which were thus brought into
more intimate relation than would in these days be thought
necessary.^ The consequence of this was that their wooden buildings presented much the same closed appearance (Fig. 83) as
Fig. 83. —Wooden building (first system\ composed by Charles Chipiez.
we have already noticed in their stone constructions ; and, more
over, as every joint was made at right angles, the pyramidal form
was entirely absent.
But the Egyptians also made use of wood for buildings very
1 In this respect there is a striking resemblance between Egyptian carpentry (see Fig. 83), and much of the joinery of the modern Japanese.

Ed. 2 In this figure we have attempted to give some notion of what a wooden building must have been like in ancient Egypt, judging from the imitations of assembled construction which have been found in the tombs and»sarcophagi of the ancient empire.

which, by contrast, might be called an open system of construction. The edifices upon which it was employed were generally of small

size, and in this respect resembled those which we have described,
but they were distinguished by a different system of carpentering.
We know them only by the figured representations which have
come down to us, for they were httle calculated to outlast the
centuries (Fig. 84). This second system lends itself as little as
the first to pyramidal and kindred forms ; horizontal lines, also,
were in it of but secondary importance. Composed of a few vertical members bound together at the top, such a building was
allied to the portico type which has already been described. This method of carpentry seems to have been used only for sub
ordinate buildings ; but yet it should not be passed by in silence.
It was frequently used for the construction of light decorative
pavilions, and it had a set of principles which are as susceptible
of definition as those of the most ambitious architecture.
Metal must have entered into the construction of these pavilions.
It may have furnished either the horizontal or the vertical
members, and it is certain that it was partly used for the roofs.
In all wooden structures the roof must also be of wood, because
the light walls which are proper to the material could not support
the great weight of a flat stone covering, still less could they stand
up against the combined weight and thrust of a stone or brick
vault, which would destroy them in very summary fashion.
§ 7.

Decoration.
We have hitherto described Egyptian architecture according to
the general character of its forms and principles of construction ;
we must now attempt to give a true idea of its method of
decoration. This may be described in a very few words. For the
decoration of the vast surfaces, either plain or curved, which their
style of architecture placed at their disposal, the Egyptians made
use of paint. They overlaid with a rich system of colour the
whole inside and outside of their buildings, and that with no desire
to accentuate, by a carefully balanced set of tones, the great
constructive lines, contours and mouldings, nor with any wish to produce merely a complicated, polychromatic ornamentation.
Groups of figures borrowed from the animal and vegetable
kingdoms form its chief constituents. In these picture decora
tions, man is seen in every attitude or vocation, side by side with



I20 A History- of Art in Ancient Egypt.
birds, fishes and quadrupeds, and with those composite forms
which have been created by himself to represent his gods.
Intaglio and bas-relief often lend their help to the ornament.
Images and explanatory inscriptions are sometimes cut in the
stone, sometimes modelled in slight relief; but in either case all
figures are distinguished by their proper colour as well as by the
carved or modelled outlines. It will thus be seen that Egyptian decoration is distinguished
by the intimate and constant alliance of two elements which are
often separated in that of other races. The first is the employ
ment of colour to give variety to surfaces and to distinguish
different members of the architecture by the opposition of tones.
The second is the employment of colour for the representation of
life, for which purpose every surface is seized upon, whether the
face of a wall, or the round shaft of a column. The decorator is
not satisfied to use colour to give force to the lines of a building
and to increase its general effect ; he also makes use of it to
interpret, to multiply, and to immortalize the ideas which float
through his own brain. A building thus ornamented presents us
with a series of pictures embodied in its own constitution. From
cornice to foundation, upon wall and column, it is covered with an
unending series of wall paintings, which, like a gorgeous tapestry,
envelop and embellish it without hiding any of the details of its
construction.
The polychromatic decoration of the Egyptians is to be
e.xplained, like that of the Assyrians, of the Greeks, of the Italians,
and of all other southern nations, by the quality and quantity of
their daylight and the way in which it affected their visual organs.
The more intense the light, the more pleasure does the eye receive
from strength and variety of colour. The science of optics gives
us an explanation of this fact, but at present we are concerned only
with the fact itself, which is a matter of daily experience. It is
notorious that the colours of birds and butterflies, and of the petals
of flowers, become brighter and gaver in exact proportion as we
near the equator and leave the pole ; ^ the same rule holds good
' We here speak of the fauna as a whole, disregarding particular genera and
species. It may be said that some particular plant which is to be found both in France and Norway, is much brighter in colour when it grows in the neighbourhood of the pole than in our temperate climate, but this apparent exception only confirms the rule which we have laid down. The plant whose whole season of bloom is

which become more brilliant in colour, and more audaciousl)
abrupt in their transitions from one hue to another. Delicate
shades of difference are imperceptible by an eye blinded with the
southern sun ; it sees nothing but the simplest, strongest, and
frankest colour notes to the exclusion of all half-tint.^
Under a burning and never clouded sun, objects of a neutral
colour do not stand out against their background, and their
shadows lose a part of their value, " conime ddvordes par la
diffusion et la rdverbdratioii dune incoinpai'able liuiiic're." - In
Egypt, a column, a minaret, a dome, hardly seem to be
modelled as they stand against the depths of the sky. All three
seem almost flat. The warm and varied hues with which
polychromatic decoration endows buildings help us to distinguish
them in such situations from the ground upon which they stand,
and to accentuate their different planes. They also compensate,
in some desrree, for the absence of those strong shadows which
elsewhere help to make contours visible. Attention is drawn to the dominant and bounding lines of an architectural composition
by contrasts of tint which also serve to give force to wall paintings
and bas-reliefs.
comprised between a late spring and an early autumn develops itself much more rapidly than with us, and, granting that it has become so hardened that it is able to resist the long and hard frosts of winter, it receives, during the short summer, much more light and sun than its French or German sister. During those fleeting summers of the north, whose strange charm has been so often described, the sun hardly descends below the horizon ; the nights are an hour long, and not six or seven. The colour of flowers is therefore in exact proportion to the amount of light which they receive. ^ This was perceived by Goethe. In art, as in natural science, he divined beforehand some of the discoveries of our century by the innate force of his genius. He was not surprised by the discovery that the temples of classic Sicily were painted in brilliant tones, which concealed the surface of their stone and accentuated the leading lines of their architecture. He was one of the first to accept the views of Hittorf and to proclaim that the architects who had found traces of colours upon the mouldings of Greek buildings were not deceiving themselves and others. ^ We borrow these expressions from M. Ch. Blanx, who, when in Egypt, was very much struck with this phenomenon. "'Those villages which approach in colour to that Nile mud of which they are composed, hardly stand out at all against the background, unless that be the sky itself or those sunny rocks which reflect the light in such a fashion that they fatigue the most accustomed eyes. I notice here, as I did in Greece, at Cape Sunium, that cupolas and round towers have their modelling almost destroyed by the strong reflections." {Voyage de la Haute Egyph; 1876. p. 114). VOL. I. R



122 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Polychromy is thus a help to our eyes in those countries where
a blinding light would otherwise prevent us from appreciating the
structural beauties of their architecture. It is by no means
peculiar to Egypt, but that country was the first to employ it upon
rich and vast undertakings, she employed it more constantly and
more universally than any other people, and she carried it to its
logical conclusion with a boldness which was quite unique.
The Egyptian habit of sprinkling figures over every surface
without regard to its shape, its functions, or those of the mass to
which it belonged, was also peculiar to themselves. Upon the
round shaft of the column, upon the bare expanse of the wall, these
figures were multiplied and developed to an extent which was
limited only by the length of the wall or the height of the column.
They were generally painted in bands of equal height, separated
one from another by a narrow fillet which indicated the plane upon
which the groups of figures had a footing. There is no visible
connection between the bands of figures and the structures which they ornament ; right and left, above and below, they spread over
every surface and pay no attention to the joints and other struc
tural accidents by which they are seamed (Fig. 85 and PL III.)
It may be said that these joints were invisible until the passage
of centuries had laid them bare by destroying the stucco which,
especially w'here sandstone or limestone was used, once veiled the
surface of the bare walls. ^ Doubtless this is true ; but even in a
climate such as that of Egypt, the architect could not believe that a
' Wilkinson thought there was always a layer of stucco, even upon the beautiful granite of the obelisks {Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, 2nd ed., 1878, vol. ii. p. 286.) His statement must be treated with great respect. During his long sojourn in Egypt he examined the remains of the ancient civilisation with great care and patience, but yet we think his opinion upon this point must be accepted with some reserve. There are in the Louvre certain sarcophagi and other objects in hard stone, upon which traces of colour are clearly visible on the sunk beds of the figures and hieroglyphics, while not the slightest vestige of anything of the kind is to be found upon the smooth surface around those carvings. But it is certain that granite was often stuccoed over. Mariette has verified that it was so on the obelisk of Hatasu at Thebes ; both from the inscription and the appearance of the monument itself he came to the conclusion that it had been gilded from top to bottom, and that the gold had been laid upon a coat of white stucco. "The plain surface." he says, '' alone received this costly decoration. It had been left slightly rough, but the hieroglyphs, which had their beds most carefully polished, preserved the colour and surface of the granite." {Itineraire, p. 178.) As for buildings of limestone or sandstone, like the temples of Thebes, they are always coated



Decoration.
thin coat of plaster would endure as long as the massive walls upon
which he laid it. We have here a great contrast in principle
between the decoration and the architecture of Egypt. In the
latter the chief, if not the only aim, seems to have been to make
sure of absolute stability, of indefinite duration ; and yet these
eternal walls are lined with a rich decoration which is spoiled by
the fall of a piece of plaster, which is injured by the unavoidable
settlings of the masonry and destroyed by the slightest earthquake !
Of this we need give but one conclusive instance. Our third plate
reproduces that admirable portrait of Seti 1., which is the wonder
of the temple at Abydos. This beautiful work in relief is
sculptured upon the internal faces of four unequal stones in the
wall of one of the rooms. The joints may be distinguished, but as
yet they have not opened sufficiently to do much damage to the
artistic beauty of the work ; but It cannot be denied that the pre
servation of the ro3'al effigy would have been rnuch more certainly
assured if the sculptor had chosen a single stone to work upon,
instead of a built-up wall which so many causes would help to
destroy.
When Egyptian buildings were new and their colour fresh, this method of decoration must have given them a most fascinating
brilliancy. Whether the pencil alone were employed to trace the designs upon the smooth walls, or whether its powers were supplemented by the work of the chisel, these figures, which succeeded
each other in thousands upon every wall and pillar, mingled with
inscriptions which were in themselves pictures, and dressed in the
most vivid colours, must have at once amused the eye and stirred
the brain by the variety of their tints and of the scenes which they
represented. But in spite of its breadth and vivacity the system had two grave defects.
The first was the fragility of the plaster surface upon which It
was displayed. This surface may be compared to a tapestry
stretched over the whole Interior of the building, and, to continue
the comparison, when once any portion of the plaster coat became
detached from the wall, there was nothing left but the crround or
reverse of the stuffs The design and colour may still be distin

guished or divined, but there is a great difference between painted
ornament which is subject to such damage and a woven hanging
at any time before the threads of the woof have been discoloured
and entirely worn out. The other defect in the system, is its
uniformity. It is monotonous and confused in spite of all its

richness. It suffers from the absence of that learned balance
between plain and decorated surface which the Greeks understood
so thoroughly. In the Greek temples, sculptured figures had the
more importance in that the eye of the spectator was drawn
forcibly to them by the very limitation of the space reserved for

them. They were cut from separate blocks of marble, which,
though carefully and skilfully allied with the architecture which
they were meant to adorn, did not form an integral part of it.
Such figures ran no risk of being cut in two by the opening of the
joints between the stones. Although marvellously well adapted to
the places for which they were intended, and closely allied to the
architecture by their subject as well as their material shape, they
yet preserved a life and individuality of their own. To take
decorative art as a whole, the Greeks did not make use of so many
figures as the Egyptians, but they knew better how to economize
the sources of effect, and to preserve their works against the
destructive action of time.
To Egypt, then, belongs the credit of having been the first to
discover the obligation imposed upon the architect by the sunlight
of the south — to accentuate the main lines of his edifice by means
of colour. She thoroughly understood how to make difterent
tones distinguish between the various parts of a structure and de
fend its contours against the effect of a dazzlino- \io-ht. On the
other hand, she went too far when she covered every surface,
without choice or stint, with her endless figure processions. Such
a decoration was only rendered possible by the use of a material
which compromised its durability ; and that is not her only short
coming. She failed to understand the value of repose and the
absolute necessity of contrast ; she failed to perceive that by
multiplying figures to infinity, she lessened their effect and made
them a fatigue to the eye and the intellect.



CHAPTER III.
Sepulchral Architecture.
§ I.

-The Egyptian Belief as to a Future Life and its Influence
upon their Sepulchral Architecture.
The most ancient monuments which have yet been discovered
in Egypt are the tombs ; they have therefore a right to the first
place in our sketch of Egyptian architecture.
In every country the forms and characteristics of the sepulchre
are determined by the ideas of the natives as to the fate of their
bodies and souls after life is over. In order to understand the
Egyptian arrangements, we must begin then by inquiring into their
notions upon death and its consequences ; we must ask whether
they believed in another life, and in what kind of life. We shall
find a complete answer to our question in the collation of written
texts with figured monuments.
In the first period of his intellectual development, man is unable
to comprehend any life but that which he experiences in his own
person. He is as yet unable to observe, to analyse or to generalize.
He does not perceive the characteristics which distinguish him
from thinofs about him, and he sees nothinor in nature but a
repetition of himself. He is therefore incapable of distinguishing
between life such as he leads it and mere existence. He dreams of no other way of being than his own. As such is the tendency
of his intellect, nothing: could be more natural or more logical than
the conception to which it leads him in presence of the problem
offered to him every time that a corpse descends into the grave.
M. Maspero has so thoroughly understood the originality of the
solution adopted by the Egj'ptians that we cannot do better, in
attempting to explain the hypothesis, at once gross and subtle, to
which thev had recourse for consolation, than borrow his rendering



?W|r It!
"jT

of the texts which throw Hght upon this subject, together with some
of the reflections which those texts suggested to him.^ Were we to affirm that during thousands of years no change
took place in the ideas of the Egyptians upon a future life, we
should not be believed, and, as a fact, those ideas underwent a
continual process of refinement. Under the eighteenth and
nineteenth dynasties, during those centuries when the limits of
Egyptian empire and Egyptian thought were carried farthest afield,
we find traces of doctrines which offer notable variations, and even,
when closely examined, actual contradictions. These are successive
answers made during a long course of time to the eternal and
never-changing enigma. As they became more capable of philo
sophic speculation the Egyptians modified their definition of the
soul, and, by a necessary consequence, of the manner in which its persistence after death must be understood, and as always happens
in such a case, these successive conceptions are super-imposed one
upon another ; the last comer did not dethrone its predecessor but
became inextricably blended with it in the popular imagination.
We refer all those who wish to follow minutely this curious
development of the Egyptian intellect to the subtle analysis of
M. Maspero. That historian has applied himself to the apprehension of every delicate shade of meaning in a system of thought
which has to be grasped through the veil thrown around it by
extreme difficulties of language and written character, but at the
same time he has never attempted to endow it with a precision or
logical completeness to which it had no claim. By well chosen
comparisons and illustrations he enables us to understand how the
Egyptian contented himself with vague notions, and how he manaeed to harmonize ideas which seem to us inconsistent.

We shall not enter into those details. We shall not seek to
determine the sense which the Egyptians attached, after a certain
period, to the word bdi^- which has been translated soul, nor the

distinction between it and khou, luminousness, which the soul
seems to have enveloped like a garment. We shall not follow the
soul and its internal light in its subterranean journey across Anient,
the Egyptian Hades, to which it entered by a cleft, Pcga, to the westof Abydos, which was the only portal to the kingdom of the
shades ; nor shall we accompany them in the successive transfor
mations which made them acquainted with every corner of the
earth and sky in the infinite series of their becomes (to use the
Egyptian expression) ; what we have to do is to trace out the
most ancient of their religious conceptions, the conception which,
like the first teachings of infancy, was so deeply engraved upon the
soul and intellect of the race as to exercise a much stronger
influence than the later more abstract and more philosophical
theories, which were superimposed upon it. In this primitive conception we ought to find the determining cause of the Egyptian
form of tomb. Its constitution was already settled in the time of
the ancient Empire, and, from the Memphite dynasties until the
end, it remained unchanged in principle. In this constitution we
shall find embodied the essential idea adopted by the Egyptians
when they first attempted to find some eternal element in man, or,
at least, some element which should resist the annihilation of death
for a period much longer than the few days which make up our
mortal life.
The Egyptians called that which does not perish as the dying man draws his last sigh, the ka, a term which M. Maspero has
rendered as the double. " This doiible was a duplicate of the body
in a matter less dense than that of the body, a projection, coloured
but aerial, of the individual, reproducing him feature for feature, a child if coming from a child, a woman if from a woman, and a man if from a man." ^
1 Cotifirencc, p. 381. Mr. Herbert Spencer, in the first chapters of his Principles of Sociology, has given a curious and plausible explanation of how this conception of a double was formed. He finds its origin chiefly in the phenomena of sleep, of dreams, and of the faintness caused by wounds or illness. He shows how these more or less transitory suspensions of animation led men to suppose that death was nothing but a prolonged interruption of life. He also thinks that the actual shadow cast by a man's body contributed to the formation of that belief. But had it no other elements which belonged to the general disposition of humanity in those early periods of intellectual life ? Into that question we cannot enter here further than to say that Mr. Spencer's pages make us acquainted with numerous f.icts which prove that the beliefs in question were not confined to a single race, but were common to all humanity.



Sepulchral Architecture. 129
This double had to be installed in a lodging suitable to its
existence, had to be surrounded by objects which it had used in its
former state, had to be supplied with the food which was- necessary
for the sustenance of its life. And all these things it obtained from
the piety of its relations, who, on fixed days, brought them to the
threshold of the good diuelling or the eternal divclling, which were
the phrases used by the Egyptians.^ By these offerings alone
could the hungry and thirsty phantom which had replaced the
living man be kept alive. The first duty of the survivors was
to take care that this dependent existence should not be extin
guished by their neglect, to provide food and drink for the support,
if we may use such a phrase, of the precarious life of the dead, who
would otherwise be irritated against them and use the almost god
like power attributed to his mysterious condition for the punishment
of his ungrateful posterity.^
This conception is not peculiar to Egypt. The double of the
Egyptian sepulchral records corresponds exactly to the ilhinXov^
of the Greeks and the -umbra of the Latins. Both Greeks and
Latins believed that when the funeral rites had been duly accom
plished, this image or shadow entered upon the possession of
a subterranean dwellino- and beran a life which was no more
oo than the continuation of that in the light. ^ The dead thus
remained in close relation with the living, on the one hand by
the nourishment which they received, on the other by the pro
tection which they afforded ; even in the funeral repast they
took their parts, in the strictest sense of the word, in the eating
and drinking.^ They looked impatiently forward to these supplies
1 This expression, which is very common in the Egyptian texts, seems to have made a great impression upon the Greek travellers. The following passage of DiODORUS is well known : " This refers to the beliefs of the natives, who look upon the life upon earth as a thing of minor importance, but set a high value upon those virtues of which the memory is perpetuated after death. They call their houses hotels, in view of the short time they have to spend in them, while they call their tombs their eternal divellings " (i. 51). 2 The dead were put under the protection of, and, as it were, combined with, Osiris ; they talked of the Osiris so and so in naming one who was dead.
^ EiSuAa Ka/xdi'T<D)/ (//. xxiii. 72 ; Od. xi. 476 ; xxiv. 14). • This belief is clearly stated in a passage from Cicero quoted by Fustel : " Sub terra censebant reliquam vitam agi mortuorum " {Tiisc. i. 16). This belief was so strong that it subsisted even after the universal establishment of the custom of burning the bodies of the dead. ' Texts to this effect abound. Fustel brought the more remarkable of them

because, for a moment, they awoke their dormant thoughts and
fecHngs and gave them ghmpses of the true hfe, the life above
ground and in the sunshine.^ If they were kept waiting too long they became angry and revenged themselves upon those who
had caused their sufferings. Woe to the family or city which
was not careful to interest the dead in its stability and thus to
associate them with its prosperity! ^
These beliefs seem to have been common to all ancient peoples
during that period of their existence which is lost in the shadow
of prehistoric times. From India to Italy all the primitive forms
of public and private rights betray their presence. For this
fact and its consequences we may refer our readers to the fine
work of M. Fustel de Coulange, La Cite antique.'^
together in his Cite antique (p. 14). We shall be content with quoting three : " Son of Peleus," said Neoptolemus, "take this drink which is grateful to the dead ; come and drink this blood" (Hecuba, 536). Electra says when she pours a libation: " This drink has penetrated the earth ; 'my father has received it " (Choephoroe, 162). And listen to the prayer of Orestes to his dead father : " Oh my father, if I live thou shalt have rich banquets ; if I die thou wilt have no portion of those smoking feasts which nourish the dead" (Choephorce, 4S2-484). Upon the strange persistence of this belief, traces of which are still found in Eastern Europe, in Albania, in Thessaly, and Epirus, the works of Heuzey {Mission arMologigue de Maca/oine, p. 156), and Albert Dumont {k Balkan et PAdriatigue, pp. 354-356), maybe consulted. Some curious details relating to the funeral feasts of the Chinese are to be found in the Comptes rendiis de V Academic des Inscriptions, 1877, p. 325. There are some striking points of resemblance between the religion of China and that of ancient Eg}-pt
;
in both one and the other the same want of power to develop may be found. Taking them as a whole, both the Chinese and the Egyptians failed to emerge from the condition of fetichism. ^ In the eleventh book of the Odyssey it is only after " they have drunk deep draughts of black blood " that the shades are capable of recognising Ulysses, of understanding what he says and answering. The blood they swallowed restored their intelligence and powers of thought. - The speeches of the Greek orators are full of proofs that these beliefs had a great hold upon the popular mind, even as late as the time of Demosthenes. In contested cases of adoption they always laid great stress upon the dangers which would menace the city if a family was allowed to become extinct for want of precautions against the failure of the hereditary line; there would then be some neglected tomb where the dead never received the visits of gift-bringing friends, a neglect which would be visited upon the city as a whole as the accomplice in such abandonment. Such an argument and others like it may not seem to us to be of great judicial value, but the talent of an Isseus understood how to make it tell with an audience, or we should not find it so often repeated in his pleadings (see
G. Perrot, L Eloque/ice politique et judiciare a Athcnes. Les Fricurseurs de JDemost/iine,

scientific spirit tended to make the notion of a being suspended
between life and death ever more strange and inadmissible.



132 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Experience accumulated its results and it became daily more
evident that death not only put an end to the activity of the
organs, but that, immediately upon its occurrence, it began to
dissolve and decompose their tissues. As time rolled on men
must have found it very difficult to believe in a shadow thus placed
outside the normal conditions of life, in a something which was
not a spirit and yet survived the destruction of its organs.
It would seem then that observation and logical reflection
should soon have led to the abandonment of a theory which
now appears so puerile ; but, even in these scientific times,
those whose intellects demand well defined ideas are few indeed.^
At a period when the diffusion of intellectual culture and the
perfection of scientific methods add daily to our accumulations
of positive knowledge, most men allow their souls to be stirred and their actions to be prompted by the vaguest words and notions ;
how much greater then must the influence of those confused
beliefs and baseless images have been in antiquity when but a
few rare minds, and those ill provided with means of research and
analysis, attempted to think with originality, clearness and freedom.
The prestige of this illusion was increased and perpetuated
by its intimate connection with several of those sentiments which
are most honourable to human nature. Such a worship of the
dead surprises and even scandalizes us by its frank materialism,
but if we seek for the source of its inspiration and its primitive
meaning, we find them in the remembrance of lost objects of
affection, in feelings broken by the supreme separation, in the
gratitude of children to the parents who gave them birth and
nourished their infancy, in the recognition by the living of the
blessings which they enjoy through the long and laborious efforts
of their ancestors. There was no doubt a perishable element
in the funerary ideas of Egypt, an element which the progress of
reason was sure to destroy, and we may be tempted to smile
when we think of the Greek or Egyptian giving himself the
' Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his ingenious and subtle analysis q{ primitive ideas draws our attention to their frequent inconsistencias and even positive contradictions ; but he shows us at the same time that the most highly civilised races in these modern days admit and combine ideas which are logically quite as irreconcilable as those which
seem to us so absurdly inconsistent when we think of the beliefs of the ancients or of savage races. Custom renders us insensible to contradictions which we should perceive at once were we removed to a distance from them. {The Principles of
Sociology, vol. i. pp. 119, 1S5).

trouble to feed his departed ancestors with blood, milk, or honey,
but with all their simplicity, both one and the other were alive to a
truth which the revolutionary spirit of our days, with its childish
and brutal contempt for the past, is often unable to grasp. They
realized the complete solidarity of one human generation with
another. Guided by their hearts alone they anticipated the results
at which modern thought has arrived by close and attentive study
of history. From a reasoned out conviction of this truth and
its consequences, philosophy now draws the principles of a high
morality ! but long before our days this idea and the tender,
grateful, sentiments which it provoked had been a powerful instru
ment in the moral improvement of the first-born of civilization and
a bond of union for their civil and domestic life.
We have thought it right to dwell upon this worship of the
dead and to describe its character at some length, because the
beliefs upon which it was based are not to be found so clearly set
forth in the art of any other people, Their most complete, clear,
and eloquent expression, in a plastic form, is to be seen in the
tombs which border the Nile. And why is this so ? It is because
the Egyptian industries were already in full possession of their
resources at the period when those beliefs had their strongest
hold over the minds and feelings of the people. In the case
of Greece, art did not arrive at its full development until the
worship of the dead had lost its high place in the national
conscience. When the Greek cjenius had arrived, after much
striving, at its complete power of plastic expression, the gods
of Olympus had been created for several centuries, and art was
called upon to interpret the brilliant polytheism of Homer and
Hesiod, to give outward image to those gods, and to construct
worthy dwellings for their habitation. Sculptors, painters, and
architects still worked indeed, at the decoration of the tomb.
They strove to give it beauty of shape and arrangement, and to
adorn its walls with bas-reliefs and pictures ; they designed for
it those vases and terra cottas which, in our own day, have been
found in thousands in the cemeteries of Greece and Italy, but all
this was only a subordinate use of their talent. Their ambition
was to build temples, to model statues of Zeus, Pallas, and
Apollo. On the other hand, those distant ages in which primi
tive and childish ideas of religion prevailed, had no art in which
to manifest their beliefs with clearness and precision.



134 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
It was otherwise in the valley of the Nile. A well provided
industry and an experienced art laid themselves out to inter
pret the popular beliefs and to defend the dead against final
dissolution, or the agonies of hunger and thirst. Egypt did not
differ from other nations in its opinions upon the mystery of
death. In the infancy of every race the same notions on this
matter are to be found, and in this respect the only difference
between the Egj-ptians and the rest of the world is very much to
the credit of the former ; they rapidly attained to a degree of
civilization which was only reached by other races after their
religious development was comparatively mature. Thanks to
this advantage, they Vv-ere enabled to push their ideas to con
sequences which were not to be attained by tribes which were
little less than barbarous, and they had no difficulty in e.xpressing
them with sufficient force and precision.
It remains for us to show the use which the Egyptians made of
their superiority in doing more honour to their dead, in guarding
them more safely against the chances which might shorten the
duration or destroy the happiness of their life in the tomb. The
fulfilment of this duty was, as the Greek travellers rightly affirmed,
their chief pre-occupation. Their sepulchral architecture was, of
all their creations, the most original and the most characteristic
of their genius, especially in the forms which we find in the
cemeteries of the Ancient Empire. In the time of the New Empire, at Thebes, it is less complete and homogeneous. In the
latter the arrangement and decoration do not spring, as a whole,
from a unique conception ; we find traces in it of new hypotheses
and novel forms of belief. These do not supersede the primitive
ideas ; they are added to them, and they bear witness to the
restless efforts made by human thought to solve the problem of
human destiny. These apparent contradictions and hesitations
are of great interest to the student of the Egyptian religion, but
from the art point of view the Memphite tombs are more curious
and important than those of later date. They have the great
merit of being complete in their unity both of artistic form and of
intellectual conception. They are the offspring of a single growth,
and are perfect in their clear logical expression. And again, they
are the type of all the later tombs, of those at Abydos, at Beni
Hassan, and at Thebes. Certain details, indeed, are modified,
but the general disposition remains the same to the end. We



Sepulchral Architecture. 135
shall, therefore, find the ruling principle of Egyptian sepulchral
architecture most clearly laid down in the cemeteries of Gizeh
and Sakkarah.
The first and most obvious necessity for the oljscure form of life which was supposed to commence as soon as the tomb
had received its inmate, was the body. No pains, therefore,
were spared which could retard its dissolution and preserve the
organs to which the double and the soul might one day return.^
Embalming, practised as it was by the Egyptians, rendered a
mummy almost indestructible, so long, at least, as it remained in the dry soil of Egypt. On the warm sands of Sakkarah and close
to the excavations from which the fellahs of the corvde were
returning at the enci of their day's labour, we—my travelling
companions and myself—stripped a great lady of the time of
Ramses of the linen cloths and bandages in which she was closely enveloped, and found her body much in the same condition as it must have been when it left the workshop of the Memphite
embalmer ! Her black hair was plaited into fine tresses; all her
teeth were in place between the slightly contracted lips ; the almond-shaped nails of her feet and hands were stained with
^ The texts also bear witness to the ideas with which the complicated processes of embahning were undertaken. See P. Pierret, Le Dogme de /a Rhurrection, &c., p. 10. "It was necessary tliat no member, no substance, should be wanting at the final summons ; resurrection depended on that." " Thou countest thy meiiihcrs ivhich are complete and intact." (Egyptian funerary text.) " Arise in To-deser (the sacred region in which the renewal of life is prepared), thou august and coffined mummy. Thy bones and thy substance are re-united with thy flesh, and thy flesh is again in its place; thy head is replaced upon thy neck, thy heart is ready for thee." (Osirian statue in the Louvre.) The dead took care to demand of the gods " that the earth should not bite him, that tlie soil should not consume him." (Mariette, Feuilles d'Abydos.) The preservation of the body must therefore have been an object of solicitude at the earliest times, but the art of embalming did not attain perfection until the Theban period. Under the ancient empire men were content with comparatively simple methods. Mariette says that " more examples would have to be brought together than he had been able to discover before the question of mummification under the ancient empire could be decided. It is certain, first, that no authentic piece of mummy cloth fronr that period is now extant ; secondly, that the bones found in the sarcophagi have the brownish colour and the bituminous smell of mummies. " Not more than five or six inviolate sarcophagi have been found. On each of these occasions the corpse has been discovered in the skeleton state. And as for linen, nothing beyond a little dust upon the bottom of the sarcophagus, which might be the debris of many other things than of a linen shroud." {Les Tombes de I'Ancien Empire, p. 16.)



136 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
henna. The Hmbs were flexible and the graceful shapes but little
altered under the still firm and smooth skin, which, moreover,
seemed to be still supported by flesh in some parts. Had it not
been for its colour of tarred linen or scorched paper, and the smell of naphtha which arose from the body and from the numberless bandages which were strewn about, we might have shared the
sentiment attributed to Lord Evandale in Theophile Gautier's
brilliant Roman de la Moviie ; with an effort of good-will we could
almost sympathise with those emotions of tenderness and admi
ration which were excited in the breast of the young Englishman
at the sight of the unveiled charms of that daughter of Egypt
whose perfect beauty had once troubled the heart of the proudest
of the Pharaohs.^ In order that all the expense of embalming should not be
thrown away, the mummy had to be so placed that it could not be
reached by the highest inundations of the river. The cemeteries
were therefore established either upon a plateau surrounded by the
desert, as in the case of Memphis and Abydos, or in the sides of
the mountain ranges and in the ravines by which they were
pierced, as at Thebes and Beni Hassan. In the whole valley of
the Nile, no ancient tomb has been discovered which was within
reach of the inundation at its highest.
The corpse was thus preserved from destruction, first by careful
and scientific embalming, secondly by placing its dwelling above
the highest " Nile." Besides this we shall see that the Egyptian
architects made use of many curious- artifices of construction in
order to conceal the entrance to the tomb, and to prevent the
^ Passalacqua gives the following description of the mummy of a young woman which he discovered at Thebes : " Her hair and the rotundity and surprising regularity of her form showed me that she had been a beauty in her time, and that she had died in the flower of her youth." He then gives a minute description of her condition and ornaments, and concludes by saying that "the peculiar beauty of the proportions of this mummy, and its perfect preservation, had so greatly impressed the Arabs themselves that they had exhumed it more than once to show to their wives and neighbours." {Catalogue raisonne et historique des Antiquitcs decouvertes en Egypte, 8vo. 1826.) ^ Rhind describes several mummy-pits in the necropolis of Thebes which receive the water of the Nile by infiltration ; but, as he himself remarks, this is because those who dug them did not foresee the gradual raising of the valley, and, consequently, of the level attained in recent ages by the waters of the Nile. It is doubtless only within the last few centuries that the water has penetrated into these
tombs. {T/iebes, its Tombs and their Tet!a?i/s. [>. 153.)



Sepulchral Architecture. 137
intrusion of any one coming with evil intentions. All kinds of
obstacles and pitfalls are accumulated in the path of the unbidden
visitor, with a fertility and patient ingenuity of invention which
has often carried despair Into the minds of modern explorers,
especially in the case of the pyramids. Mariette was fond of
saying- that there are mummies in Egypt which will never, in the
strictest sense of the word, be brought
to light.
But in spite of all this pious and subtle foresight, it sometimes happened that
private hate or, more often, the greed of
gain, upset every calculation. Enemies
might succeed in penetrating to the sepul
chres of the dead, in destroying their
bodies, and thus inflicting a second death
worse than the first ; or a thief might drag
the corpse from its resting place, and
leave it naked and dishonoured upon the
sands, that he might, with the greater ease,
possess himself of the gold and jewels with which it had been adorned.
The liability of the mummy to accident
had to be provided against. The idea of
the unhappy condition in which the double would find itself when its mummy had
been destroyed, led to the provision of
an artificial support for it in the shape of
a statue. Art was sufficiently advanced
not only to reproduce the costume and
ordinary attitude of the defunct and to
mark his age and sex, but even to render
the individual characteristics of his physi
ognomy. It aspired to portraiture ; and
the development of writing allowed the
name and qualities of the deceased to be inscribed upon his statue.
Thus identified by its resemblance and its inscriptions it served to
perpetuate the life of the double, which was in continual danger of
dissolution or evaporation in the absence of a material support.
The statues were more solid than the mummy, and nothing
stood in the way of their multiplication. The body gave but one

chance of duration to the double ; twenty statues represented
twenty chances more. Hence the astonishing number of statues which are sometimes found in a single tomb. The images of the dead were multipHed by the piety of surviving relations, and con
sequently the double was assured a duration which practically
amounted to immortality.^
We shall see that a special recess was prepared in the thickness
of the built up portion of the tomb for the reception of wooden or
stone statues, so that they might be kept out of sight and safe

from all indiscreet curiosity. Other effigies were placed in the
chambers of the tomb or the courts in front of it. Finally, we
know that persons of consideration obtained from the king per
mission to erect statues in the temples, where they were protected
by the sanctity of the place and the vigilance of the priests.

From the point of view of the ancient Egyptians such precau
tions were by no means futile. Many of these effigies have come
down to us safely through fifty or si.xty centuries and have found
an asylum in our museums where they have nothing to fear but
the slow effects of climate and time. Those which remain intact

may therefore count upon immortality. If the double required
nothing to preserve it from annihilation but the continued e.xistence

pyramid, would be still alive, preserved by the magnificent statue of

the world itself. But, unhappily for the shade of Pharaoh, this
posthumous existence which is so difficult of comprehension to us,
was only to be prolonged by attention to conditions most of which
could not long continue to be observed.

It was entirely a material life. The dead-alive had need of food
and drink, which he obtained from supplies placed beside him in

repasts which took place periodically in the tomb, of which he
had his share. The first of these feasts was given upon the con
clusion of the funeral ceremonies,^ and they were repeated from
year to year on days fixed by tradition and sometimes by the
expressed wish of the deceased.- An open and public chamber
was contrived in the tomb for the celebration of these anni
versaries. It was a kind of chapel, or, perhaps, to speak more
accurately, a saloon in which all the relations and friends of
the deceased could find room. At the foot of the stele upon which
the dead man was represented sacrificing to Osiris, the god of the
dead, was placed a table for offerings, upon which the share
intended for the double was deposited and the libations poured.
A conduit was reserved in the thickness of the wall by which the
odour of the roast meats and perfumed fruits and the smoke of
the incense might reach the concealed statues.'
The Egyptians did not trust only to the piety of their descend
ants to preserve them from a final death by inanition in their
neglected tombs. At the end of a few generations that piety
might grow cold and relax its care ; besides, a family might become
the sycamore, corn, cakes, &:c. See the Catalogue oi Passalacqua, pp. 123, 151, and elsewhere. Quarters of meat have also been found in them, which are easily recognised by dieir well-preserved bones. 1 Maspero, Etudes si/r quelques Peintures fuiierains, in the Journal Asiatiquc,
May-June, 1880, p. 387, et seq. ^ In one of the great inscriptions at Beni Hassan, recently translated anew both by Isl. Maspero and Professor Birch, Chnoumhotep speaks thus : " 1 caused to prosper the name of my father. I completed the existing temples of the Ka. I served my statues at the great temples. I sacrificed to them their food, bread, beer, water, vegetables, pure herbs. My priest has verified (I chose a priest for the
Ka,— Maspero). I procured them from the irrigation of my work-people (I made him
master of fields and slaves, — Maspero). I ordered the sepulchral offerings of bread, beer, catde, fowl, in all the festivals of Karneter, at the festivals of the beginning of the year, the opening of the year, increase of the year, diminution of the
year (little year, — Brugsch and Maspero), close of the year, at the great festival, at the festival of the great burning, at the festival of the lesser burning, the five
intercalary days, at the festival of bread making (of the entry of grain, — Maspero) at the twelve monthly and half monthly festivals, all the festivals on the earth (plain), terminating on the hill (of Anubis). But should my sepulchral priest or men conduct them wrongly may he not exist, nor his son in his place."

perpetual foundation. They devoted to the purpose the revenues
of some part of their property, which was also charged with the
maintenance of the priest or priests who had to perform the
ceremonial rites which we have
described.^ We find that, even
under the Ptolemies, special
ministers were attached to the
sepulchral chapel of Cheops, the
builder of the great pyramid.
It may seem difficult to believe
that a " foundation " of the
ancient empire should have sur
vived so many changes of rdgmie,
but the honours paid to the early kings had become one of the
national institutions of Egypt.
Each restoring sovereign made it
a point of duty to give renewed life to the worship of those remote
princes who represented the first glories of the national history.
1 See the paper by M. Maspero upon the great inscription at Siout, which has
preserved for us a contract between Prince Hapi-Toufi and the priests of ApMotennou, by which offerings should be regularly made to the prince's statue, which was deposited in a temple at Siout. {Transactions of 'he Society of Biblical
Archaology, vol. vii. pp. 1-32.) ^ It was the same in the case of a still older king, Seneferu, the founder of the fourth dynasty. (De Rouge, Recherches siir les Monuments que I'on pent atlribuer

Besides which there were priests attached to each necropoHs, who,
for certain fees, officiated at each tomb in turn. They were
identified by Mariette upon some of the bas-rehefs at Sakkarah.
Their services were retained much in the same way as masses are
bought in our days.^
The same sentiment led to the burial with the dead of all
arms, clothes, jewels, and other objects of which they might have
need in the next lite. We know what treasures of this kind have
been obtained from the Egyptian tombs and how they fill the cases
of our museums. But neither was this habit peculiar to Egypt.
It was common to all ancient people whether civilized or
barbarous. Traces are to be found even in the early traditions of
the Hellenic race of a time when, like those Scythians described by
Herodotus,'-^ the Greeks sacrificed, at the death of a chief, his
wives and servants that they might accompany him to the next
world. When she began to reveal herself in the arts Egypt
was already too far civilized for such practices as these ; thanks to
the simultaneous development of science, art and religion, she
found means to give the same advantages to her dead without
permitting Scythian cruelties. Those personal attendants and
domestic officers whose services would be so necessary in another
life, were secured to them at a small expense ; instead of slaying
them at the door of the tomb, they were represented upon its walls
in all the variety of their occupations and in the actual moment of
labour. So too with all objects of luxury or necessity which the
double would wish to have at hand, as for instance his food and
drink.3
A custom which would seem to have established itself a little

dynasty, and the sixth chapter of the Book of the Dead, which is engraved upon them, seems to be one of the most ancient. Egypt
tologists are now inclined to beHeve tliat the essential parts of this
ritual date back as far as the Memphite period.
These statuettes are of different sizes and materials. As a rule
they do not exceed from eight to twelve inches, but there are a
few which are three feet or more in height. Some are in
wood, some in limestone, and some in granite, but as a rule
they are made of that kind of terra cotta which, when covered
with green or blue enamel, has been called Egyptian porcelain.
They are like a mummy in appearance ; their hands are crossed

upon the breast and hold instruments of agriculture such as hoes
and picks, and a sack meant for grain hangs from their shoulders.
The meaning of all this is to be sought in the Egyptian notions
of a future life ; it is also explained by the picture in chapter XC. of the Ritual, which shows us the dead tilling, sowing and
harvesting in the fields of the other world. The texts of the Ritual
and of certain inscriptions call these little figures ouskcbti or
answerers from the verb ousheb, to answer. It is therefore easy
the most brilliant fashion, which served to hold these statues when they were placed in the tomb. The siije and the richness of their ornament depended upon the wealth of the deceased for whom they were made.

every precaution against the misery and final annihilation which
would result from abandonment, the Egyptian thought he could
never go too far in furnishing, provisioning and peopling his tomb.
The ingenuity of their contrivances is extraordinary. Food in
its natural state would not keep, and various accidents, might, as
we have shown, lead to the death of the do7ible by inanition. It
was the same with furniture and clothes ; the narrow dimensions
of the tomb, moreover, would forbid the accumulation there of
everything which its sombre tenant might desire. .On the other
hand the funerary statuettes were made of the most indestructible
materials and the bas-reliefs and paintings were one with the
thick walls of stone or living rock. These have survived practi
cally unaltered until our day. We visited the tomb of Ti a short time after its chambers had been opened and cleared. It was marvellous to see how form and colour had been preserved intact
and fresh under the sand, and this work which was four or five
thousand years old seemed to be but lately finished. By the bright
ness of their colours and the sharp precision of their contours
these charming reliefs had the effect of a newly struck medal.
Such scenes from the daily life of the people continued to be figured upon Egyptian tombs from the old empire to the new. When their study and comparison were first begun different
explanations were put forward. Some believed that they were an
illustrated biography of the deceased, a representation of his
achievements or of those over which he had presided during the
course of his mortal life ; others saw in them an illustration of his
future life, a setting forth of the joys and pleasures of the Egyptian
Elysium.
Both these interpretations have had to give way before the
critical examination of the pictures themselves and the decipher
ment of their accompanying inscriptions. It was soon perceived,
through comparisons easily made, that these scenes were not
anecdotic. On a few very rare occasions they seem to be
connected with circumstances peculiar to the inhabitant of the tomb. There are a few steles and tombs upon which the dead man
seems to have caused his services to be described, with the object,
no doubt, of continuing in the next world his career of honour
and success in this. Such an inscription is so far biographical,
and a similar spirit may extend to the decorations of the stele
and walls of the tomb. As an example of such narrative

epigraphs we may cite the long inscription of Ouna, which
eives us the h'fe of a sort of o^rand-vizier to the two first King-s
oo o of the sixth dynasty ;
^ also the inscriptions upon the tombs of those
feudal princes who were buried at Beni-Hassan. In the latter
there are historical representations as commentaries upon the text.
Among these is the often reproduced painting of a band of Asiatic
emigrants bringing presents to the prince and demanding, perhaps,
a supply of wheat in return, like the Hebrews in the time of
Jacob.
But all this is exceptional. As a rule the same subjects occur
upon the tombs again and again, in the persistent fashion which
characterizes traditional themes. The figures by which the flocks
and herds and other possessions of the deceased were numbered
are too great for literal truth.- On the other hand the pictured
tradesmen and artificers, from the labourer, the baker, and the
butcher up to the sculptor, seem to apply themselves to their work
with an energy which excludes the notion of ideal felicity. They,
one and all, labour conscientiously, and we feel that they are
carrying out a task which has been imposed upon them as a dut}'.
For whose benefit do they take all this trouble } If we attempt
to enter into the minds of the people who traced these images and
compare the pictured representations with the texts which accom
pany them, we shall be enabled to answer that question. Let us
take by chance any one of the inscriptions which accompany the
scenes figured upon the famous tomb of Ti, and here is what we
find. " To see the picking and pressing of the grape and all the
labours of the country." Again, " To see the picking of the flax,
the reaping ot the corn, the transport upon donkeys, the stacking
of the crops of the tomb." Again, " Ti sees the stalls of the
oxen and of the small animals, the gutters and water-channels
of the tomb."
It is for the dead that the vintage takes place, that the flax
is picked, that the wheat is threshed, that o.xen are driven into
the fields, that the soil is ploughed and irrigated. It is for the
supply of his wants that all these sturdy arms are employed.
We shall leave M. Maspero to sum up the ideas which presided
at the construction of the Egyptian tomb, but first we must draw

our readers' notice to the fact that he, more than once, alludes to a
conception of the future life which differs somewhat troni the early
Egyptian notions, and belongs rather to the Second Theban
Empire and its successors.
" The scenes chosen for the decoration of tomb walls had a magic
intention ; whether drawn from civil life in the world or from that
of Hades, they were meant to preserve the dead from danger
and to insure him a happy e.xistence beyond the tomb Their reproduction upon the walls of the sepulchre guaranteed
the performance of the acts represented. The double shut up in

and he ate and drank with her ; crossing in safety the terrible
gulfs of the lower world in the barque of the gods, and he crossed
them in safety. The tilling, reaping, and housing on his
walls were for him real tilling, reaping, and housing. So, too,

For the reason which led the Greeks to adopt a term which now seems rather fantastic, see Pierret, Didionnaire d'ArcMologie egyptienne. The chief passages in ancient aufliors in which the term is applied either to the subterranean excavations of Egypt or to other galleries of the same kind, are brought together by Jomard in the third volume of the Description (Antiquites, vol. iii. pp. 12-14).

influence all the work of the fields, and, like the sorcerer's pestle
in Goethe's ballad, drew water for him and carried grain. The
workmen painted in his papyri made shoes for him and cooked
his food ; they carried him to hunt in the deserts or to fish in the
marshes. And, after all, the world of vassals upon the sides
of the sepulchre was as real as t\\e.dotcb/c for which they laboured ;
the picture of a slave might well satisfy the shadow of a master;
The Egyptian thought that by filling his tomb with pictures he
insured the reality of all the objects, people, and scenes represented
in another world, and he was thus encouraged to construct his
tomb while he was yet alive. Relations, too, thought that they
were doine a service to the deceased when thev carried out all

the mysterious ceremonies which accompanied his burial. The
certainty that they had been the cause of some benefit to him
consoled and supported them on their return from the cemetery
where they had left their regretted dead in possession of his imaginary domain." ^
Such a belief is astonishing to us ; it demands an effort of the
imagination to which we moderns are in no way equal. We. have
great difficulty in realising a state of mind so different from what
ours has become after centuries of progress and thought. Those
early races had neither a long enough experience of things, nor a

sufficiently capable power of reflection to enable them to distinguish
the possible from the impossible. They did not appreciate the
difference between living things and those which we call inanimate.
They endowed all things about them with souls like their own.
They found no more difficulty in giving life to their carved and
painted domestics, than to the mummy or statue of the deceased, or
to the phantom which they called the double. Is it not natural to
the child to take revenge upon the table against which he hurts
himself, or to speak tenderly to the doll which he holds in his
arms .''

This power to endow all things with life and personality is now
reserved for the poet and the infant, but in the primitive days of
civilization it belonged to all people alike. Imagination had
then a power over a whole race which in our days is the gift of
great poets alone. In the efforts which they made to forestall the
wants of the helpless dead, they were not content with providing
the food and furniture which we find upon the walls. They had a
secret impression that these might be insufficient for wants renewed
through eternity, and they made another step upon the way upon
which they had embarked. By a still more curious and still bolder
fiction than those which had gone before, they attributed to prayer

the power of multiplying, by the use of a few magic sentences, all
objects of the first necessity to the inhabitants of the tomb.
Every sepulchre has a stele, that is to say, an upright stone
tablet which varied in form and place in different epochs, but always
served the same purpose and had the same general character.
Most of these steles were adorned with painting and sculpture ; all
of them had more or less complicated inscriptions.^ In the semi
circle which forms the upper part of most of these inscribed slabs,
the dead person, accompanied by his family, presents offerings to a
god, who is usually Osiris. Under this an inscription is carved
after an unchanging formula : " Offering to Osiris (or to some other
deity, as the case may be) in order that he may give provision of
bread, liquid, beef, geese, milk, wine, beer, clothes, perfumes, and
all good and pure things upon which the god subsists, to the ka
of N . . ., son of M . . . ." Below this the defunct is often
shown in the act of himself receiving the offerings of his family.
In both divisions the objects figured are looked upon as real, as
in the wall decorations. In the lower division they are offered
directly to him who is to profit by them ; in the upper, the god is
charg-ed to see that thev are delivered to the ritrht address. The
provisions which the god is asked to pass on to the defunct are
first presented to him ; by the intervention of Osiris the doubles of
bread, meat and drink pass into the other world to nourish the
double of man. But it was not essential for the gift to be effective
that it should be real, or even q2iasi-x&2i\. ; that its image should
even be given in paint or stone. The first-comer could procure
all things necessary for the deceased by their enumeration in the
proper form. We find therefore that many Egyptians caused the
following invocation to jjassing strangers, to be engraved upon
their tombs :
" Oh you who still exist upon the earth, whether you be private
individuals, priests, scribes, or ministers entering into this tomb, if
you love life and do not know death, if you wish to be in favour
with the gods of your cities and to avoid the terrors of the other
world, if you w'ish to be entombed in your own sepulchres and to transmit your dignities to your children, you must if you be
scribes, recite the words inscribed upon this stone, or, if not, you
must listen to their recital : say, offering to Amen, master of
Karnak, that he mav give thousands of loaves of bread, thousands

156 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
of jars of drink, thousands of oxen, thousands of geese, thousands
of garments, thousands of all good and pure things to the ka, or
double, of the prince Entef " ^
Thanks to all these subtle precautions, and to the goodwill with
which the Egyptian intellect lent itself to their bold fictions, the
tomb deserved the name it received, the house of the double. The
double, when thus installed in a dwelling furnished for his use,
received the visits and offerings of his friends and relations ; " he
had priests retained and paid to offer sacrifices to him ; he had
slaves, beasts of burden, and estates charged with his support. He
was like a great lord sojourning in a strange country and having
his wants attended to by intermediary officials assigned to his
service." '^ This analogy between the house and the tomb is so complete
that it embraces details which do not seem very congruous. Like
the house of the living, the tomb was strictly oriented, but after a
mystic principle of its own.
As soon as the Egyptian began to think he perceived the most
obvious of the similarities between the sun's career and that of
man. Man has his dawn and his settinsj. Man grows from the early glimmerings of infancy to the apogee of his wisdom and
strength ; he then begins to decline and, like the magnified evening
sun, ends by disappearing after his death into the depths of the soil.
In Egypt the sun sets every evening behind the Libyan chain ;
thence he penetrates into those subterranean regions of Anient
across which he has to make his way before the dawn of the next
day. The Egyptian cemeteries were therefore placed on the left
bank of the Nile, that is, in the west of the country. All the
known pyramids were built in the west, and there we find all the
more important "cities of the dead," the necropolis of Memphis and those of Abydos and Thebes. A few unimportant groups of
tombs have indeed been found upon the eastern bank ; but these
exceptions to a general rule are doubtless to be explained by a
question of distance. For any city placed near the eastern border
1 \Ve borrow the translation of this inscription, as well as the reflections which precede it, from M. jNIaspero {Conference, p. 382). According to M. de Roug^, it dates from about the twelfth d3nasty. An invocation of the same kind is to be found in another epigraph of the same period, the inscription of Amoni-Amenemhait, hereditary prince of the nome of Meh, at Beni-Hassan.

of the wider parts of the Nile valley, a burying-place in the Libyan
chain would be very inconvenient both for the transport of the
dead, and for the sepulchral duties of the survivors.^
Each morning sees the sun rise as youthful and ardent as the
morning before. Why then should not man, after completing his
subterranean journey and triumphing over the terrors of Anient,
cast off the darkness of the tomb and again see the light of day ? This undying hope was revivified at each dawn as by a new
promise, and the Egyptians followed out the analogy by the way in
which they disposed their sepulchres. They were placed in the
west of their country, towards the setting sun, but their doors, the
openings through which their inmates would one day regain the
light, were turned to the east. In the necropolis of Memphis, the
door of nearly every tomb is turned to the east,- and there is not
a single stele which does not face in that direction.''' In the ne
cropolis of Abydos, both door and stele are more often turned
towards the south, that is towards the sun at its zenith.^ But neither at Memphis, at Abydos, nor at Thebes is there a tomb
which is lighted from the west or presents its inscription to the
setting sun." Thus, from the shadowy depths where they dwell,
the dead have their eyes turned to that quarter of the heavens
where the life-giving flame is each day rekindled, and seem to be
waiting for the ray which is to destroy their night and to rouse
them from their long repose.'^
' Among the cemeteries of the right bank we may mention that of TelhelAmarna ; where the tombs would have been too far from the city had they been dug in the Libyan Chain. The cemeteries of Beni-Hassan and of Eilithyia {El-Kab) are also in the Arab Chain. In spite of these exceptions, however, the west was the real quarter of the dead, their natural hal.iitation, as is proved by the tearful funeral songs translated by M. Maspero : " The mourners before the ever-to-be praised Hor-Khom say, 'O chief, as thou goest toward the West, the gods lament thee.' The friends who close the procession repeat, ' To the West, to the West, oh praisewortliy one, to the excellent AVest !

The ideas and beliefs which we have described were common
to all Egyptians, irrespective of class. When he felt his last hour
approaching, the humble peasant or boatman on the Nile was as
an.xious as Pharaoh himself to insure the survival of" his double

Those who, when alive, had to be content with a hut of earth or
of reeds, could not, when dead, expect to have a tomb of stone or
brick, a habitation for eternity ; thev could not look for jovs in the
other world which they had been unable to procure in this. So

we ha^e described must always have remained the exclusive pri

of the king, the princes and nobles, the priests, the military chiefs,
and functionaries of every kind down to the humblest of the
scribes attached to the administration. As for those Egyptians
who did not belong to this aristocracy, they had to be content with
less expensive arrangements. The less poor among them at least
took measures to be embalmed and to be placed in a coffin of
wood or papicr-niackc', accompanied by scarabs and other charms
to protect them against malignant spirits. The painted figures
upon the coffin also helped to keep off evil influences. If they
could afford it they purchased places in a common tomb, where the mummies were heaped one upon the other and confided to the
care of priests who performed the funerary rites for a whole
and his own life was well understood by Champollion, who used it to explain the paintings in the royal tombs at Thebes. (See his remarks on the tomb of Ranieses V. on the iS5th and following pages of his Letlres d' Egypte, Sec.)

But those who could procure even these sHght advantages u-ere
still among the favourites of fortune. Many were unable to obtain
even this minimum of funeral honours. On the confines of all the
great cemeteries, at Thebes as well as at Memphis, corpses are
found deposited in the loose sand two or three feet from the surface. Some of these are packed in the leaves of the palm, others are roughly enveloped in a few morsels of linen. They
have been hastily dipped in a bath of natron, which has dirtied rather than embalmed them.^ Sometimes even these slender precautions have been omitted. Bodies have been found in the
earth without vestige of either coffin or linen swathes. The sand
seems to have been intrusted with the work of drying them,
and they have been found in our days in the condition of
skeletons.

On the other hand, the fortunate ones of the world, those who
were so easy in their circumstances in this life that they could
place themselves in the same happy condition in the ne.xt, spared
no expense in anything connected with their burial. They never
allowed themselves to be surprised by death, as we so often do.
Whether kings or private individuals, they made their preparations
while they were still alive, and caused their tombs to be constructed

piety of relations spared nothinc^ that could add to the beauty and
convenience of dwellings which were to be the eternal resting
places of their inmates. The palaces of the princes and rich men
of Egypt were so lightly built that they have left no traces upon the
soil ; but many of their tombs have subsisted uninjured to our day, and it is from them that we have obtained our treasures of Egyptian
art. All the other nations of the ancient world followed the
good example thus set, or rather, to speak more accurately,
being all penetrated with similar ideas, they took similar courses without borrowing one from the other. Whenever we moderns have opened any of those ancient tombs which have happily remained intact, we have been met by the same dis
coveries. Whether it be in Egypt or Phcenicia, in Asia Minor,
Cyprus or Greece, in Etruria or Campania, the same astonishing
sight meets our eyes. The tombs are filled with precious objects
and chefs doeuvres of art which their depositors had intended never
again to see the light of day.
In modern times, when piety or pride stimulates to the
decoration of a tomb, all the care of the architect, the sculptor and
the painter is given to the outside, to the edifice which surmounts
the actual grave. The grave or other receptacle for the coffin is as plain and simple in the most sumptuous monuments of our
cemeteries as in the most humble. Our funerary architecture is
based ujaon our belief that the tomb is empty ; that the vital part
of the deposit confided to it has escaped to rejoin the current of
eternal life. Under such conditions the tomb becomes above all
things a commemorative structure, a more or less sincere
manifestation of the grief of a family or of society at large for the
loss of one of its members. As for the narrow |)it into which the
"mortal coil " is lowered, all that we demand of it is that it should

" To be laid to rest in the tomb which he had made for himself and furnished with every necessary was the greatest good which the gods could insure to an Egyptian.

be deep enough and properly closed. Art makes no attempt to
illumine its darkness. She leaves to workmen the task of
e.xcavation and of building its walls and confines herself to the
visible parts of the tomb. The dead within furnishes the pretext
for her activity, but it is the admiration of the living that is her
real incentive. The ideas of the ancients on this matter were, as we have seen,
very different. They looked upon the tomb as an inhabited
house ; as a house in which the dead was to lead some kind of
existence. Rich men wished their tombs to look well outside,
even to the distant spectator, but it was to the inside that their
chief attention was turned. They wished to find there all the
necessaries, the comforts, the luxuries, to which they had been
accustomed during life. So we find that the Egyptians, the
Greeks or the Etruscans, were willing enough, when they built
their own tombs or those of their relations, to throw a iuimdus of
earth above it, or, later, a constructed building which was con
spicuous at a distance. In those sepulchres which were cut out of
the side of a mountain, the fronts were carved with frieze,
pediment and columns into the shape of a regularly constructed
portico ; but the chief object of solicitude to the proud possessor
of such a tomb, was its internal furnishing and disposition. For
him there was no removal should he be discontented with his lodging. When a man is condemned by illness or accident to keep his room, he takes care to surround himself with everything that he may want. He gathers immediately about him all the
comforts and luxuries which he can afford ; and death is an illness
from which there is no recovery.
Impelled by such ideas as these, the ancients filled their tombs
with precious objects and decorated them with sumptuous art, all
the more that they seemed well guarded against intrusion for the sake of gain. Thus the Achseans of Mycenre (if that be the
proper name of those mysterious people) buried, in the sepulchres
discovered by Dr. Schliemann, the innumerable objects of gold and silver which now fill the museum of Athens ; thus the tombs of
Bceotia were filled with those marvels of grace and delicate
workmanship, the terra cottas of Tanagra ; and those of Etruria and Campania with the most beautiful painted vases ever
produced by Greek taste. Identity of religious conception thus led, from end to end of

the antique world, to funerary arrangements which bore a curious
resemblance one to another, so that sepulchral architecture among
the ancients had, as a whole, a very different character from that
of the moderns. This character is more strongly marked in
Egypt than anywhere else, and therefore we have studied it in
detail. The general observations to which it has given rise have
been made once for all, and we shall not have to repeat them
when we describe the funeral customs of other ancient peoples.
We shall then confine ourselves to pointing out the slight
differences which naturally spring up in the several interpretations
of a common belief
We have still to show how the varying circumstances of time
and place caused the Egyptian tomb to pass through certain
modifications of form and decoration, which, however, were never
of so radical a nature as to affect its general appearance and
arrangement. Until Egypt became a mere geographical expression
and her venerable civilization lost its independence and originality,
these latter remained practically unchanged.
^2. The Tomb under tJic Ancient E??ipirc.
Among the tombs which date from the time of the ancient
empire, the most interesting to the traveller are, of course, the
Pyramids. Long before his arrival at Cairo he sees the summits
of those artificial mountains rising into the air above the vapours
raised by the sun, and above the dust thrown up by the teeming
population of the city. At that distance their peaks seem light
and slender from their height above the horizon (Plate I. 2).
The tourist's first visit is paid to the Pyramids, and many an
European leaves Egypt without seeing any other ancient building.
He thinks that he has qualified himself to discourse upon
Egyptian architecture because a few shouting Arabs have landed
him, exhausted, upon the topmost stone of the pyramid of Cheops,
and have painfully dragged and thrust him along those passages of
the interior which will ever be among his most disagreeable recol
lections. During all this his eyes and thoughts are entirely given
to the preservation of his own equilibrium, and he sees nothing of
the real constitution of the structure he has come to visit.
In spite of the wonderful panorama which repays the fatigues

of the ascent, and of the overpowering- impression made upon the
mind by their colossal mass, the Pyramids, as we see them to-day
are far from being the most complete and interesting of the
sepulchral monuments left to us by the early dynasties. The
largest and best preserved are not so old as some of the tombs in
the necropolis of Memphis, and, royal burying-places as they are, their arrangement and ornamentation are less rich and expressive
than those of many sepulchres built by private individuals. Many
of the latter, in their comparatively restricted dimensions, answer
better to the definition of a tomb suggested to us by our study
of the national beliefs.
We shall, therefore, reserve the Pyramids for future treatment,
and in our review of the successive forms taken by sepulchral
architecture, we shall assign the first place to those private tombs, dating from the Ancient Empire, which are to be found in the
necropolis of Memphis. Notwithstanding a few differences, to
which we shall refer hereafter, these tombs, as a whole, can be
traced to a single type, of which Lepsius was the first to perceive
the interest.^ This type, which was first clearly brought to light
by the many and deep excavations carried out by Mariette, has
been known for some years past by the Arab term masiabaj^ which
means literally a bench, a bench of stone or wood. This name
was given by the labourers employed upon the excavations, and
seemed well adapted to their long and low shapes, which bear
some resemblance to those divans, or ottomans, which are found
in every room of an oriental dwelling. Mariette was struck by
the fitness of the expression, and used it ever after to designate
that particular kind of tomb.
Mariette will be our constant guide in this part of our study. After having opened many hundreds of these monuments,
he published in the Rcvtic archcologique, what we may call a
theory of the mastaba.^ In all essential matters we shall allow
his words to speak for themselves ; when he enters into more
detail than is necessary for our purpose, we shall content ourselves
with epitomizing his descriptions.

The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. i6t
THE MASTABAS OF THE NECROPOLIS OF MEMPHIS.
The space over which the monuments which we propose to
describe are spread, is on the lett bank ot the Nile, and extends
from AboH-Roasli to Dashour ; it is thus, in all probability, the
largest cemetery in the world, being more than fifteen miles in length, and of an average width ot from two to two and
a half miles.^ It was, in a word, the burial-place for Memphis
and its suburbs, and Memphis seems to have been the largest
city of Egypt, and to have boasted an antiquity which only Thinis
could rival. Excavations have failed, apparently, to confirm the
assertion of Strabo, who describes the early capital of Egypt as
reaching to the foot of the Libyan chain. On the contrary, it
seems to have been confined between the canal which is called the
Bahr Yitsscf and the Nile. It would thus have formed a very
long and rather narrow city, close upon the river, of which the
site may still be traced by the more or less barren hillocks strewn
with blocks of granite and fragments of walls, which crop up from the plain between Gizeh and Chinbab. For forty centuries
there was a continual procession of corpses from Memphis itself,
and probably from towns on the other side of the Nile, such as
Heliopolis, to the plateau which lies along the foot of the Libyan
chain. The formation of this plateau makes it peculiarly well
adapted for the purpose to which it was put. It consists of a thick
bed of soft limestone, covered by a layer of sand which varies in
depth from many yards to a few feet according to the inequalities of the ground beneath it.
It was easy, therefore, either to lay bare the rock and to
construct the tomb upon it, or to dig the mummy pits in its
substance, and the winds might be trusted to quickly cover the grave with sand which would protect it when made. The same
sand covered the coffinless corpse of the pauper with its kindly
particles. Age after age the dead were interred by millions in this
great haven of rest. At first there was plenty of room, and the
corpses were strewn somewhat thinl\- in the sand,- but with time

In walking

economy of space had to be practised, until at last bodies were
squeezed into the narrowest spaces between older inhabitants. Sometimes these new comers even intruded into the tombs of those who had gone before them, and that without always
troubling themselves to conceal their usurpation by effacing the
name of the rightful owner.^
The number of tombs was increased to a prodigious e.xtent
by the non-employment of those family tombs which, as we shall
see, were made use of by the Phcenicians, the Greeks, and the
Etruscans. The Egyptian sepulchre was a personal appanage.
The husband and father of a family admitted into it only his wife
and such of their children as died young. The son, when he in
turn became the head of a family, built a tomb for himself. Each
generation, each human couple marked their passage through the world by the erection of a new tomb.
All the niaslabas belong to the period of the Memphite empire.
Those who built them were able to give free play to their fancies,
and to develop the structure, both above and below ground, both
in arrangement and in decoration, to any extent they pleased. We
may therefore look upon them as the freest, the most spontaneous,
and the most complete expression of the ideas formed by the
men of that remote age concerning death and the life beyond
the grave.
The mastabas of Sakkarah will receive most of our attention,
and in describing them we shall often have occasion to quote the
words of Mariette.^ Those which are to be found in the more
northern part of the necropolis, in the neighbourhood of the
Great Pyramid, differ only in unimportant details from those at
Sakkarah. The general appearance now presented by these monuments may be guessed from the sketch which JVI. Bourgoin
eastwards, that is, from the pyramid towards the cultivated land, we pass a first zone of tombs which date from the Ancient Empire, a second which possesses sculptures of the twenty-sixth dynasty, and a third which dates from the Greek period. We may quote as an interesting example of such usurpation the Theban tomb first opened by a Scottish traveller, Henry Rhind, to whose interesting work {Thebes, i/s Tombs and their Tenants, Ancient and Present, ivith a Record of Excavations in t/ie Neeropoiis, Longman, 1862, 8vo.) we shall often have to refer. This tomb seems to have been made in the reign of Amenophis III. by a brother and sister whose statues were found in it, but it also contained Sebau, son of Menkara, a high official of the time of the Ptolemies, with his wife and all his family (c. iv.). 2 Mariette {Voyage dans la haute Egypte, p. 32) thought that the word Sakkarah was an ancient name derived from Socharis, a Memphite form of Osiris.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 167
has sent us of the tomb of Sabou (Fig. 106). The other
mastabas figured by us have all been more or less restored.
" The mastaba is a massive structure, rectangular on plan, with
four faces of plain walling, each being inclined at a stated angle
towards their common centre. This inclination has led some
people to assert that it is nothing more than an unfinished pyramid.
Such an idea is refuted, however, by the fact that the divergence
from the perpendicular is in some cases so slight that, were the
walls prolonged upwards, their ridges, or aretes, would not meet lor some eight or nine hundred yards. The mastaba might be

more justly compared to the space comprised between two hori
zontal sections of an obelisk, supposing the obelisk to have an oblong base.
" The major axis of the rectangle upon which these structures are
planned, always runs due north and south, and at the pyramids of
Gizeh, the necropolis of the west, they are arranged upon a sym
metrical plan so as to resemble a chess board on which all the
squares are strictly oriented.^ The more carefully built mastabas
are oriented according to the true astronomical north. All the
others show the same intention, and, in those instances where an
error of a few degrees is to be discovered, it is to be clearly
- The way in which the mastabas were arranged with respect to each other is well shown in plates xiv. and xviii. of Lepsius's first volume (map of the pyramids of Gizeh and panorama taken from the simimit of the second pyramid).



i68 A History of Art in Ancient EovrT.
attributed to carelessness on the part of the builder, a common
fault in these tombs, and not to a difference of intention. We
often find that the northern face is not strictly parallel to the
southern, nor that on the west to that on the east.
" Although not varying much from true orientation, the mastabas of Sakkarah are not arranged with the symmetry which distin
guishes those on the south and west of the Great Pyramid.^ They
are sprinkled about in a rather haphazard fashion. Here we find
them well interspaced and there actually placed one upon another.
Fig. 107. —Three mastabas at Gireh. Perspective view, after the pLin of Lepsius. {Denkmnler, vol. i. pi. 24.)
It follows that the chess-board arrangement which is so conspicuous at Gizeh is not here to be noticed. Even at Sakkarah
there were streets between the rows of tombs, but they are so
' The general aspect of this city of the dead, and the regularity of its monuments, made a great impression upon the members of the " Institut d'Egypte." The following are the words of Jomard {Description, vol. v. p. 619): "From the top of the building one sees an infinite quantity of the long rectangular structures extending almost to the Pyramids. They are carefully oriented, and exactly aligned one with another. I counted fourteen rows of them, in each direction, on the west of the Great Pyramid, and as many on the east, making nearly four hundred in all. The sand under which many of them are buried leaves their forms easily distinguishable." Since the time of Jomard many of the mastabas have been changed by the excavations into mere formless heaps of dihris, and yet the general arrangement can still be clearly followed.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 169
irregularly placed, and they are often so narrow, many of them
being nothing more than blind alleys, that the inexperienced visitor
may well fancy himself in a maze. " The Sakkarah mastabas are built either of stone or brick.
" The mastabas of stone are of two kinds : those of a very hard
blue siliceous limestone and those of a softer chalky limestone which is found upon the spot. This latter stone was used for the Stepped Pyramid. The tombs upon which it was used seem to
be much the oldest in the necropolis ; they are also the least rich
and important.
Fig. ioS. — Restoration of part of the Necropolis of Gizeh.
" Our general notion of Egyptian architecture would lead us to
look for the use of huge stones in these mastabas, and, in fact,
certain important monuments, such as the Mastabat-el-Faraoun,
and parts of important monuments, such as the Temple of the
Sphinx and the passages and chambers of the greater pyramids,
were constructed of very large blocks. But the Sakkarah architects
were more modest. Apart from the ceilings, architraves and other
places where big stones were necessary, the blocks are of an
average height of about half a yard, with a proportionate length
and thickness.
" The brick-built sepulchres are of two kinds also. The more

elaborate are of black brick, while a yellowish brick is used for the
others. The yellow bricks are a mixture of sand and pebbles with
a little clay ; the black bricks are of earth and straw. The former
are always small (8"8 in. x 4-4 in. x 2'S in.) ; the latter are
comparatively large (i5'2 in. x 7'2 in. x 56 in.). Both kinds
are dried simply in the sun. The yellow bricks seem to be the more ancient. Their employment begins and ends with the
Ancient Empire. The black bricks, on the other hand, appear for
the first time about midway through the fourth dynasty. At first
they were rarely employed, but under the eighteenth dynasty and
those which followed it, they came to be exclusively used."
All these mastabas, whether of brick or stone, betray an amount
of neelieence in their construction which is astonishino^. Con
sidering the ideas which the Egyptians had formed of a future life,

the chief preoccupation of their architects should have been to
give a stability to their sepulchres which would have insured their
perpetuity, and, with it, that of the deposit committed to their
charge. The whole of our description will be pervaded by
accounts of the minute precautions devised to that end. " Now
these mastabas are constructed with care on their outsides alone.
The core of their walls is composed of sand, of rubbish, of blocks
of stone mingled with the flakes struck off by the masons, and all
this in most cases without any cement to give it coherence. The mastabas of Sakkarah are not homogeneous constructions of masonry and cement, like the pyramids and most of the mastabas
of Gizeh. They are confused heaps of ill assorted materials, which
would collapse but for the retaining strength of their covering of
solid stone.



The Tomb under the Ancient Emitrk. i/i
" At Sakkarah the outward faces of the mastaba are not smooth.
Each successive course is slightly set back from the one below it.
At Gizeh the walls form a smooth plane gently inclined from the
perpendicular.
" There are mastabas of all sizes. That of Sabou measures 172
feet by 84 ; that of Ha-ar, 149 by 74; that of Ra-en-ma 169 by
81, and that of Hapi no more than 25 ft. 6 in. by 19 ft. 6 in. In
height they vary less. The highest are not more than from 26
to 30 ft. high, the smallest about 12."
The roof of the mastaba is a plain surface without irregularity
of any kind ; but the soil above it is sprinkled with vases buried
at a slight depth. These vases are pretty evenly distributed, but
Fig. no. —Entrance to a M.i?;t.iba at Sakkarah. Marictte.
they are rather more numerous in that part of the soil which
covers the ceilings of the chambers, a circumstance of which
Mariette often made use to guide him in his excavations. Like
all the vases of this epoch, those which are found upon the roof of
the mastabas are roughly made, pointed at the bottom and without
handles. They each contain a thin film of yellow clay deposited
by the water with which they were filled. They were placed in
their curious position under the notion that the water which they
contained would quench the thirst of the dead man below. The
mouths of the jars were covered with flat stones, and the water
would last long enough to satisfy at least the immediate necessities
of the inhabitant of the tomb.



i;: A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
" The principal face of the mastaba is turned to the east. In
four cases out of five the entrance to its chambers, when there is
one, is found upon this face. The general arrangement is, almost
always, as follows : i. At a few metres distance from the iiorth
easteni angle we come upon a quadrangular niche or recess, very
high and very narrow, in the depths of which those long vertical
grooves which distinguish the steles of this epoch are carved upon
the actual masonry of the tomb. For this recess an unimportant
stele, with or without inscription, is occasionally substituted, or (2)
we find, at a few metres distance from the south-eastern angle,
either a deeper, larger, and more carefully built recess, in the
depths of which a monolithic stele of white limestone covered
with hieroglyphs is placed ; or a regular architectural fagade in
miniature with a door in the centre. When the recess is found
near the southern angle of the eastern face, the tomb begins and

ends there. It has no internal chamber, or rather, the recess acts
as substitute for one. But when, instead of the niche or recess, we meet with a door, we then know that we have come upon a
regularly completed tomb. The name of its proprietor is often
carved upon the lintel. Several of these lintels, of a peculiar
shape, are to be seen in the Louvre.
" Next after the eastern face, in relative importance, comes
that which is turned to the north When the entrance is in the
northern wall the door is invariably at the back of a kind of
vestibule, in front of which are two monolithic columns, without
base or capital, supporting the architrave which, in turn, supports
the roof.
" Still more seldom than in the northern face, the entrance is
occasionally found upon that which is turned to the south. This
exceptional arrangement is, in most instances, caused by some
local circumstance which may readily be perceived. When the



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 173
entrance is on the south its arrangement is sometimes the one,
sometimes the other, of the two which we have described.
" As for the western face, we have no evidence that it ever played any more ambitious role than that of completing
the inclosure. It is always destitute of both openings and ornaments."
We have thus explored, with Mariette, the outside of the
mastaba. We have described its form and general aspect, we
have noticed the materials of which it was constructed, the
principles upon which it was oriented, and its average size.
We have explained, too, how this single type of sepulchre was
repeated many thousands of times with but slight variations, until,
upon the plateau between Memphis and the desert there gradually
arose a metropolis of the dead more populous than that of the
living. It remains to describe the contents of those hu^e blocks
of masonry. We shall begin by visiting the chambers planned by
the architect in the building itself; we shall afterwards penetrate,
by the paths which modern curiosity has established through the
debris of ages and the depths of the soil, to those recesses of the
tomb which were meant to be for ever inaccessible.
The interior of a mastaba is composed of three parts —the
chamber, the serdab, and the well. The last-named of the three
is the only part which is never wanting. Many of the mastabas
are, in fact, solid. In them the chamber is in a very rudimentary
condition, being represented merely by one of those external
niches which Mariette has described. This arrangement was
the earliest, and, as long as the mastaba continued to be built,
the less ambitious tenants of the necropolis were contented to
reproduce it. But in these pages, as in a natural history, it is
important to study the species when fully developed and provided
with all its organs. When we have clearly established a general
type nothing is more easy than to recognise and point out its
variations. It suffices to say here that some ombs are wanting in
one, some in another of those constituent parts whose meaning
and uses we shall attempt to determine, and that, in a few, they
are of an unaccustomed importance.
It is natural that we should first turn our attention to the
chamber. This was a kind of neutral ground upon which the
quick and the dead could meet, the former to present, the latter to
receive the funeral offerings.



1/4 A HibTORY OF Art in Ancient Egvft.
" The interior of a mastaba may be divided into several
' chambers ' (there are three in the tomb of Ti), but generally
there is only one. It is entered by the door in the middle of
the facade. " These chambers have, as a rule, to depend upon the door for
light, but there are a few instances in which they are lighted from
openings in the roof. A remarkable example of the latter arrange
ment is to be seen in the tomb of Ti, where the innermost chamber, which otherwise would be in complete darkness, is
lighted from the roof.
" The chamber is sometimes quite bare, sometimes covered with sculptures and paintings such as those whose character
and meaning we have already pointed out. At its further end,
and always facing eastwards, stands the inscribed tablet or stele.

There are some chambers in which the walls are bare and the
stele engraved, but there are none where the walls are carved and
the stele plain." In the tomb of Ptah-Hotep, of which we reproduce the
principal side, the stele proper is on the left, but the figures
and the funerary inscriptions cover all the central part of the
richly decorated wall (Fig. 115). We see, then, that the stele is the one indispensable part of
this complicated whole. It was, in fact, upon the formula with
which it was inscribed, that the Egyptians depended for those
magical agencies by which Osiris became the active medium of
transmission between the living and the dead. " At the foot of the stele there was often a table for offerings.



nt MM n i\ I I M H II n I I II ly f M I JJJJJI i

in granite, alabaster, or limestone. This was laid flat upon the
ground (Fig. 92).
" As a rule this was the only piece of furniture in the chamber ;
but occasionally we find, on each side of the stele and always
placed upon the ground, either two small limestone obelisks, or
two objects in that material resembling table legs hollowed out
at the top for the reception of offerings."
This chamber was left open to every comer. The entrance
was in fact left without a door. To this rule Mariette found
but two exceptions in the many hundreds of tombs which he
examined.^
" Not far from the chamber, oftener on the south than the
north, and oftener on the north than the west, a passage in the
masonry, high, narrow, and built of very large stones, is found.
The workmen employed upon the excavations christened it the
serdab, or corridor, and their name has been generally adopted." ^
In Figs. 1 16-1 19 we give the plan and three sections of a mastaba
at Gizeh which has i'our serdabs.
"Sometimes the serdab has no communication with the other
parts of the mastaba, it is entirely walled in, but in other instances
there is a narrow quadrangular opening, a sort of pipe or conduit,
which unites the serdab with the chamber. It is so small that the
hand can only be introduced into it with difficulty.^
" The use of the serdab is revealed by the objects which have
been found in it ; it was to hold one or more statues of the
deceased. The Egyptians believed these statues to be the most
certain guarantees, always with the exception of the mummy itself,
of a future life for the dead. Hidden from sight in their dark
prison, they were protected from all violence, while they were
separated only by a few stones from the chamber where the
1 One of these exceptions is furnished by the tomb of Ti, of which we shall often have to speak (Fig. 114). The large public hall near the entrance to the tomb was separated from the two chambers farther in by a corridor closed at two points by doors, some remains of which were found in place when the tomb was opened. - This is a word of Persian origin adopted by the Arabs. Its strict meaning is a dark subterranean opening, cave, or passage. ' The tomb of Ti had two serdabs as well as three chambers ; one of these was close to the door, the other in the innermost part of the mastaba. In the latter several statues of Ti were found, the best preserved being now in the museum at Boulak. VOL. I. A A

friends and relations met together, and the conduit by which the
intervening wall was often pierced, allowed the smell of fruit and
incense and the smoke of burnt fat to come to their nostrils.^ " No inscriptions have been found in a
serdab except those upon the statues. And
no objects other than statues have ever
been found in a serdab." So that the
function of the serdab was to afford a safe
and final asylum to the statues. These
were, no doubt, to be found in other
situations also, because, not to mention the

chamber, was open to every chance passer by, and the statues
' In a Theban tomb described by M. Maspero {Etude siir quelques Peintures funeraires) the tenant, Harmhabi, is made to speak thus : " I have come, I have received my bread ; joining the embahiied offerings to my members, I have breathed the scent of the perfumes and incense." It is also possible that this conduit may have been intended to permit of the free circulation of the dutib/e, to allow it to pass from its supporting statues to the chapel in which it is honoured. This curious idea, that the spirit of the dead can pass through a very small hole, but that it cannot dispense with an opening altogether, is found among many nations. The Iroquois contrived an opening of very small diameter in their tombs, through which the soul of the dead could pass and repass. See Herbert Spencer, Principles of
Sociology, vol. i. p. 192. 2 There is an example of this in a mastaba at Gizeh (Fig. 120). See No. 95 of
Lepsius {Denkiiiccler, vol. i. p. 29 ; vol. iii. pi. 44).



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 179
which they both contained were in continual danger from care
less or malicious hands. It was to guard against such chances
as these that the inventive architects of Egypt contrived a safe
retreat in the heart of the massive structure which should provide
a reserve of statues against every contingency. When all those
which were exposed to accident should have perished, these would
still survive and would furnish to the double the material support,

the tangible body, to which that phantom was obliged to attach
himself unless he wished to perish entirely.
These precautions were not ill conceived. The serdab kept
efficient guard over its deposit ; the museum of Boulak con
tains at least a hundred statues from the ancient empire which were found at Sakkarah, and nine-tenths of them were found in
the serdabs.
We have now described all
those parts of the tomb which were above ground. We have not been content with visiting the chamber only, which was
freely left open, we have pene
trated into the farthest recesses,
and have discovered those
secrets of the massive walls
which their constructor thought to hide for ever from the eye
of man. But even -yet we have not arrived at the actual place
of burial ; we shall reach it, however, through our third internal
division, the well or pit.
" The well is an artificial excavation, square or rectangular in
plan, never round, at the bottom of which is the chamber in which
the mummy is deposited. " To arrive at the opening of the well, we must mount to the

platform, or roof, of the mastaba (Fig. 122). As there was never
any staircase to a mastaba either within or without, it will be seen
that the well must have been a very inaccessible part of the tomb."
In one single instance, namely, in the tomb of Ti, the well is sunk
from the tloor of the largest of the internal chambers, but whether
it opened upon the roof or upon the floor of the chamber, it was
always closed with the utmost care by means of a large flat stone.

" The well is generally situated upon the major axis of the
mastaba, and, as a rule, nearer to the north than to the south. Its
depth varies, but, on an average, it is about forty feet. Now
and then, however, it has a depth of si.xty-five or even eighty
feet. As the well begins at the platform and ends in the rock
carved mummy chamber, it follows that it passes vertically first
through the mastaba, secondly through the rock upon which the
mastaba is founded. The built part of the well is carefully

constructed of large and perfect stones, and in this we find one of
the distinguishing characteristics of the tombs of the ancient
empire." In the tomb ot Ti the well takes the form of an
inclined plain like a passage in the pyramids. In the common
form of well the mummy pit could only be reached by means of
ropes. *
"When the bottom of the well is reached a gaping passage
is seen in the rock which forms its southern wall. This passage,
which is not high enough to allow one to walk upright, does not
run quite parallel to the axis of the
mastaba. It is directed obliquely to
wards the south-east, like the chamber
above. Suddenly it becomes enlarged
into a small cavern, which is the mortuary
chamber properly speaking, that is to
say, the room with a view to which the whole structure has been planned and
to which all its other parts are but
accessories.
" This mortuary chamber is vertically
under the public hall above, so that the
survivors who came togrether in the
latter for the funeral ceremonies had the
corpse of the deceased under their feet,
at a distance which varied according to
the depth of the well."
The mortuary chambers are large and
carefully built, but generally without ornament or inscription. Of
all those explored by him Mariette found but one which had its
walls ornamented ; in the middle of its decorations, which he
does not describe, he contrived to make out a few phrases which
seemed to belong 'to the Ritual of the Dead. The sarcophagus was placed in one corner of the chamber.
It was generally of fine limestone, sometimes of red granite,
and on a few occasions of opaque black basalt. It was rect
angular on plan with a round-topped lid squared at the angles.

Mariette found none at Sakkarah with inscriptions. On the other hand we find them upon the sarcophagus at Khoo-foo-Ankh,
which was discovered at Gizeh and belongs to the fourth dynasty
(Figs. 123, 124). " The Egyptians did not always trust to the mere size and
weight of thg lid for the secure closing of the sarcophagus. The
under-side of the cover is made with a rebate at its edw which fits
into a corresponding groove on the upper edge of the sarcophagus, and the two edges were bound still more tightly together by a

very hard cement. Finally, as if all these precautions were not
enough, wooden bolts were affixed to the under-side of the lid
which fitted into slots in the sarcophagus and helped to render the
two inseparable." So far as we can judge from the few human remains which have
been gathered from these ancient tombs, the process of embalm
ment was then carried on in simple and elementary fashion, and it
was this imperfection that the Egyptians attempted to neutralize,

by the innumerable and complicated precautions which they took
to insure that the corpse should not be disturbed in its envelope of
stone. In later times, when the preparation of the mummy was
better understood, they were not so careful to seal up the
sarcophagus from the outer air. " The furniture of the mummy chamber comprised neither
statues, nor funerary statuettes, nor amulets of any kind. Some
times a few ox bones bestrew the ground. Two or three large and
pointed red vases, containing nothing but a thin deposit of clay,
rest against the walls. Within the sarcophagus we find the same
sobriety of sepulchral furniture. Beyond a wooden or alabaster
pillow (Fig. 105) and half a dozen little drinking cups of alabaster,
nothing has been found there but the mummy itself."

These beef bones must be the remains of the quarters of
meat which were placed in the tomb for the nourishment of the
dead. No scene is more frequently represented upon the walls
of the public chamber of the mastaba than the killing and flaying
of victims for the funeral ceremonies (Fig. 125). Like those which
are found upon the roof, the vases must have held water for the
double. The pillow was placed under the head of the mummy,
it was the one he had used during his life. As for the drinkine
cups, their use has not yet been determined, so far as we know.

well is the first difificulty, and when it is found, many hands and no
little time are required to remove the rubbish with which it is
filled. The only mechanical helps which the Egyptians have ever
used in such work are those which we ourselves have seen in
the hands of Mariette's labourers, namely, the wooden shovel
and the little rush basket which is filled with a few handfuls of
sand and pebbles, and then carried on the head to be emptied at a
convenient distance. It may be guessed how many journeys
to and fro have to be made before a few cubic )-ards of dt'bris are
cleared by such means as this !

to the first six dynasties. It is certain that those monuments
form a chronological series extending over a space of from
twelve to fifteen centuries, and that during the whole of that long
period, the general character of Egyptian sepulchral architecture remained unchanged.
We should here, perhaps, in order to make our description
complete, attempt to convey a true idea of the reliefs which cover
the sides of the chamber, and of the statues which fill the serdab.
We should, perhaps, by a judicious choice of examples, endeavour
to estimate their style and composition ; but we shall postpone
all such examination until we come to treat of sculpture, and of the
way in which the earliest Egyptian artists treated the human form.
A didactic and analytic method is so far despotic that it
compels us, in order to marshal our facts and to make them
easily understood, to separate phenomena which are intimately
connected, and to destroy the unity of natural groups. We have
thus been driven to separate the figured decorations of the tomb from the architectural arrangements which enframe and
support them ; with the latter, alone, are we now concerned.
We may sum up the foregoing details by the following general
description of the Egyptian tomb as it was established in the early
ages of the national life, in those years when the national
civilization put on the form and colour which it retained until
the last days of antiquity.
This tomb, when complete, included (i) a built up part which,
being raised well above the surface of the soil, was a conspicuous
object in the landscape ; and (2) a subterranean part cut in the
living rock which was never more than a few feet below the
surface of the sand. The constructed part inclosed a chamber which was sometimes internal and sometimes external, a chamber
in which the relations of the deceased deposited the funeral
offerings, and in which the priests officiated before the stele, to
which the most conspicuous place was always given. Sometimes
this chamber is nothing more than a recess in the facade, a mere
frame for the stele. The structure also contains a retreat in its
thickness where the statues of the deceased were walled up. The subterranean part is composed of the well and the mummy
chamber. The well is sunk from different parts of the building
;
usually traversing its whole depth ; it leads to the mummy
chamber which is found at varying depths in the bowels of
the earth.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 187
Such are the constituent elements ot the »iasfaba, that is to say, of those private tombs which were contemporary with the
Pyramids. All over Egypt, in every one of the cemeteries, no
matter where they are situated or what their date, the same
elements are to be found, modified in certain particulars by the rank
of the deceased, by the nature of the soil, by the size of the tomb,
and by the changes ot fashion, but always to be easily recognized.
Of all these elements there is but one which does not persistently
reappear in monuments other than the mastaba, and that is the
serdab. This retreat for statues has not, as yet, been found in any
of the royal tombs of the first six dynasties, neither has it been met
with in the tombs of the two Theban empires, or of later epochs.
And yet it was connected with one of the most vital hopes of
the Egyptian religion. It fulfilled in the happiest manner, one of
the conditions imposed upon the Egyptian architect by the strange
conceptions of a future life which we have described. Why then
do we, as a rule, find the serdab only in the mastabas of the
Memphite necropolis.'' Its absence under the Theban princes
is, perhaps to be explained by the progress made in the science of embalming. The heads of more than one mummy have now been exhibited in the cases of European museums for many
years, and, in spite of the dampness of our climates, they still
preserve their skin, their teeth and their hair (Fig. 126). When
they had learnt the secret of preserving the body from corruption,
so that after a long series of centuries it should be pretty much
in the same condition as on the day after death, they did not
indeed, cease to make those images which were supposed to
o;uard the dotible from annihilation, but thev attached less
importance to their safety, and took less trouble to hide them.
They considered that they had done enough for their preservation
by putting them in the precincts of their tombs and temples, and
so under the guardianship of their venerated religion.
As for the other parts of the tomb, a little attention will
always suffice for their identification even in those sepulchres
which differ most from the mastaba. In some instances we shall
find the mummy chamber contrived in the upper structure, in
others the whole tomb is cut in the living rock. Sometimes we
find the chapel, as we may call the public chamber in which the
miraculous nourishment of the double took place, more or less
distantly separated from the mummy chamber ; sometimes the

well almost disappears, sometimes it ceases to be vertical and
becomes a long corridor with but a gentle slope. As a rule all
these variations are easily explained, and may be connected
without difficulty with that primitive type which we have
attempted to define by its most wide-spread and constant features. Another method of sepulture was made use of in the Ancient
Empire, a method which afterwards came into general use in
Egypt, we mean the /lypogeum, or subterranean tomb. The

Egyptian Commission has described several rock-cut, tombs in the
neighbourhood of the Pyramids, especially some which face the
western slope of the Second Pyramid. Similar tombs are to be found near the pyramid of Mycerinus. Some of these sepulchral
grottos declare their extreme antiquity by their imitations of
wooden architecture ; ^ others by their inscriptions dating from
' Description tie TEgypte, vol. v. p. 647, and Atlas, Aiit. vol. \. pi. 16,
Figs. 3, 4, and 5.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 189
the fourth and fifth dynasties. We shall not dwell long upon
these rock-cut tombs. They are generally composed of one or two
small sculptured chambers, upon one of which the well opens which
leads to the mummy chamber. We shall postpone their study
to a later chapter, as the time of the Middle Empire affords
us richer and more complete e.xamples of them than the earlier
period; but, indeed, the New Empire has left us the most
important examples of this kind of sepulchre. We shall here
content ourselves with pointing out that the architects of Mem
phis did not ignore the facilities offered by the easily cut limestone
rocks, not only for construction of well and mummy chamber, but
also for those open parts of the tomb where the funeral rites
and the ceremonies of the Ritual of the Dead were performed. In
the whole course of her long vitality Egypt did little more, either
in art or religion, than develop, with variations, the themes
presented to her by the generations which were ruled by her
first six dvnasties.
. THE PYRAMIDS.
The Diasiaba was the private tomb of the great lord or rich
citizen of primitive Egypt ; the pyrmnid was the royal tomb
for the same epoch, the tomb of that son of the gods, almost
a god himself, before whom all foreheads were bowed into
the dust. As his head towered over those of his prostrate
subjects during life, so, after death, should his sepulchre
rise high above the comparatively humble tombs of his proudest
servants. The most imposing mastabas, before the sand had buried them to the summit, must have looked small enough beside
those prodigious masses. They were ant-hills at the foot of a
palace.
It may seem that in considering the mastaba before the
pyramid we have reversed the natural order. We were led to
do so by the fact that the enormous <nass of the pyramids and
their peculiarities of construction compelled their architects to
separate elements which are found closely allied in the mastaba.
In consequence of this separation the elements in question have
not all had the same fate. In the case of the mastaba all
survived or perished together, but, in the pyramids, some are in
a marvellous state of preservation, while others have disappeared



I go A History ok Art in Ancient Egypt.
and left hardly a trace behind. We are therefore obliged to
make use of the private tomb in our restoration of that which
was peculiar to the king. Philologists have attempted to trace back the etymology of
the word irvpafiU to the ancient language of Egypt. The term was first employed by the Greeks, and from their language it
has been adopted into that of every civilized nation, with a meaning
which is scientifically exact. Its origin has been sought for in
the Coptic term pi-raina, height, and in the term pii'-aa, which
occurs continually in Exodus, and was used by Moses to signify the
reigning Pharaoh. But egyptologists now seem to be unanimous
in rejecting both these derivations. They are, we are told, refuted
by the fact that the terms which are supposed to have meant a
pyramid are never used in that sense in any of the texts. ' The words which mean a royal tomb or a tomb of any kind, have
not the remotest likeness,' says Herr Brugsch,^ ' to the term
rrvpafils. Each royal pyramid had its own name, a composite
epithet which was peculiar to itself Thus the largest of them all
was called " the brilliant dwelling of Choufou ;
" the second, " the
great ;
'' the third, " that which is on high." The word pyramid
appears therefore to be a purely Greek term, derived from Trip,
fire, and suggested by the similarity between its shape and that of
a tongue of flame.
We shall not waste our time in noticing: and refuting those
fantastic explanations of the pyramids which have been given in
modern times. We shall not trouble ourselves to prove that
they were not observatories. Those sloping tunnels, at the bottom
ot which some modern writers would set unlucky astronomers
to watch the passage of stars across the meridian, were her
metically sealed, and minute precautions were taken with the sole
object of obstructing and concealing their entrance. The four
slopes of the pyramid faced to the cardinal points, simply
because the orientation of the tomb was habitual with the
Egyptians ; we have already explained Its meaning. Still less
need we occupy ourselves with the theory, which made, however, some stir in its time, that the pyramids were bulwarks by which the ancient Egyptians attempted to keep back the sand from the
fertile valley of the Nile. The science of M. de Persigny was
well worthy of his policy. There was in both, the same turn for
1 History of Egypt (¥Mg\\s\\ version, Murray, 1879), '^ol- i- PP- 72, 73.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 191
fantastic invention, the same want of reflection and common sense.
If such a costly barrier had been either useful or necessary it
should at least have been prolorrged from one end of Egypt to the other, and all the pyramids would not have been found assembled,
with but few exceptions, in the neighbourhood of Memphis.^
No one in our day thinks of either starting or discussing such
theories as these. There are, of course, several obscure points in
the history of the pyramids, several details of their construction,
which stimulate to fresh research and lend themselves to many
different explanations ; but there can be no doubt as to their
general character. Their e.xploration and the interpretations of
the Egyptian texts have confirmed the assertions of those Greek
writers who were most familiar with Egypt, such as Herodotus,^
Diodorus Siculus,-'^ and Strabo.^ The Pyramids are sepulchres.
" They are massive, simply conceived, carefully sealed up tombs.
All entrance is forbidden even to their most carefully built corridors.
They are tombs without windows, without doors, without exterior
openings of any kind. They are the gigantic and impregnable
dwellings of the mummy ; . . . their colossal dimensions have
been invoked to bear out the arguments of those who would
attribute to them some other destination, but they are in fact to be
found of all sizes, some being no more than twenty feet high. Besides this, it must be remembered that in all Egypt no pyramid,
or rather group of pyramids, is to be found, which is not the centre
of a necropolis, a fact which is enough by itself to indicate their
iunerary character." -' It is proved still more definitely, if that be
possible, by the sarcophagi which have been found in the interna!
chambers, empty in most cases, because those chambers had been
entered and despoiled, either in the days of antiquity or in those
of the middle ages, but sometimes intact, as in the pyramid of
]\Iycerinus. The pyramids were hermetically sealed. Even with
out direct evidence we might assert that it was so, knowing as we

do the precautions which the Egyptians took elsewhere to guard
their tombs against intrusion ; but direct proof of the fact is not
wanting. When in the ninth century the KaHph Al-Mamoun
wished to penetrate into the Great Pyramid he was only enabled to
do so by breaking into it violently, near the centre of its northern
face, and thus stumbling accidentally upon the descending passage at some distance from its mouth. That he was reduced to employ
this method at the risk of meeting with nothing but the solid
masonry shows that no external indication had been left of the
opening through which the mummy had been carried in. The casing seems to have been then complete and consequently the four sides of the Pyramid must have been free from ddbris and
generally uniform. That the Arabs should have chosen the
right side for their attack was perhaps owing to the survival of
some ancient tradition indicating the northern side to be that of the
entrance, which, as a fact, it has been found to be in all the
pyramids as yet explored. Perhaps too the Arabs may have been
guided by the traces of previous attempts made either in the time
of the Persians or in that of the Romans.^ However this may be
it is very certain that had they perceived any signs of an original
doorway, they would have directed their attentions to it. Those
who seek for treasure do not, like archaeologists, strike out lines of
exploration in all directions for the satisfaction of their curiosity,
they go straight to their point.
The pyramid includes two of those four parts into which we have
divided the typical Egyptian tomb ; it contains the well and the
mummy chamber. As for the funerary chapel, there were obvious
difficulties in the way of including it in the thickness of the monu
ment itself. It would have been difficult to preserve it from being crushed by the immense weight above it, and as it would have had to be lighted from the door alone, it must always have been of the
most restricted dimensions. A different arrangement had therefore
to be devised from that adopted in the case of the mastaba. The open part of the monument was separated from that which was
destined to be sealed up from the outer world. The chapel or
temple, in which the successors of the prince buried in the pyramid
^ The existence of the passage leading to the mummy chamber was not unknown to Strabo. He says : " Very nearly at the middle of their sides, as to height, the pyramids had a stone which could be moved away ; when this is done, a winding passage appears, which leads to the coffin" (xvii. p. 1161, c).



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 193
and the priests told off for its service performed the prescribed
rites, was erected at some distance from the eastern face. The
remains of such buildinos have been found to the east of both
the second and third pyramids. That of Cheops has not
been discovered, but we may assert with confidence that it has
either been destroyed by the hand of man, or that it still lies under
the veil of sand. Were there any scrdabs concealed in the thick
ness of the temple walls ? That question cannot be answered.
The remains of those buildings are in such a condition that all
traces of such an arrangement would have vanished had there been
any. The walls have disappeared. The lower courses of
masonry are still in place, and allow us to follow the very simple
plan upon which these chapels were erected ; and that is all. It is
possible, however, that the Egyptians depended solely upon the
profound respect which was felt for the royal person, combined with
the sacredness of the spot and the vigilance of the established

priesthood of the necropolis, to preserve the august images of the
sovereign from insult or destruction. The seven or eight statues of Chephren which were found at the bottom of a pit in what is
called the Temple of the Sphinx, were all more or less mutilated,
proving that this want of precaution was sometimes disastrous.
In the course of so many centuries, during which the Hyksos, the
Ethiopians, the Assyrians, and the Persians overran the country by
turns, such statues as were not sheltered in some well dissembled
retreat must more than once have been struck off their pedestals
and broken, or, like those of the unlucky Chephren, thrown head
foremost into the depths of the earth.
As such vast importance was attached to the preservation of
the portrait statues upon which the prolongation of life after
death was made so largely to depend, is it not probable that the
idea of hiding some of them in the innermost recesses of the
VOL. I. c c



194 ^ History of Art in An'Cient Egypt.
pyramids themselves may have occurred to those who caused
those monuments to be built ? It is obvious that no hiding-place
could be more secure. No such retreats have yet been discovered
in any of the galleries which have been explored by modern
curiosity, but it does not follow that they do not exist in some
corner which has not yet been reached, which will perhaps never
be reached by the most persevering explorer. Quite lately M.
Maspero believed that he recognized a serdab in a subterranean chamber with three niches which he found near the mummy
chamber in the Pyramid of Ounas, the last king of the fifth
dynasty.^ Before w^e could say that such an arrangement does not
exist elsewhere, we should have to take some pyramid to pieces
from the first stone to the last. It might, however, be asserted
that the images of the deceased would, if hidden in the pyramid,
be too far removed from that public hall to which his relations
brought their offerings and their pious homage. At such a distance
they would not have heard the friendly voices or the magic chants ;
nor would the scent of the incense have reached their nostrils. In
a word, they would have been ill placed for the fulfilment of the
office assigned to them by the Egyptian faith.
We have hitherto spoken only of the social purposes of the
pyramid, of its office as the sepulchre of the ancient kings of
Egypt, or rather as the part of that sepulchre that corresponded
to the least interesting parts of private tombs. In the plants of
our gardens and orchards, we see cultivation develop certain organs at the expense of others. We find stamens changed into
petals, giving us double flowers, and the envelope of the seeds
thickened and made to shed perfume. We see the same process of development in the tombs of the early Egyptian monarchs. Under
the influence of their pride of station, and as a consequence of the
effort which they made to perpetuate their rank even after death,
the stone hiding-place which protected tlie mummy took a size
which is oppressive to the imagination, while the funerary chapel
remained of modest dimensions. This disproportion is to be easily
explained. The simple method of construction which distinguishes

the pyramid permitted almost indefinite extension, while archi
tecture, properly speaking, was not yet sufficiently advanced to
make use of those grandiose orders which distinguish the porticos
and hypostyle temples of the Theban period.
We have now to consider the pyramids from another point of
view, from that of their probable origin, of their variet}' of form,
and of the materials of which they are composed. Descriptions of
these monuments, such as those contained in the great works of
Vyse^ and Perring, works which gave to the world the accumulated
results of long and costly explorations, must not be looked for in
these volumes. We do not think it necessary that we should eive
even a succinct account of the more important pyramids, such as
that given by Baedeker or Isambert. Such a proceeding would be
a mere duplication of those excellent manuals, and would moreover,
be foreign to the purpose which we have before us. We take the pyramids as known. The two books just mentioned are within
the reach of all. Thanks to the precise information and the
numerous figures which they contain, we may content ourselves
with makinof a few general observations. Some of these observa
tions will refer to the pyramids as a whole, some to the peculiarities
of construction which distinguish a few, peculiarities which do not
affect that general type which seems to be as old as the Egyptian monarchy itself. As soon as a society had sprung up on the banks of the Nile
which attempted to organize itself under the directing lead of chiefs
or headmen, the latter seem to have been stuncf bv the desire to
make known their final resting-place by some conspicuous sign.
The most simple way of arriving at the desired result was to heap
up the earth over the corpse, so as to form an artificial hillock
which should be visible from a distance over the level plain. This
was the origin of that funerary mound which modern archaeologists
call a tiumiliis. The tumulus is to be found in most districts of
the ancient as well as of the modern world. But to confine our
selves to our own province, it is to be found in pre-Christian times

among the Scythians of Herodotus and our ancestors the Gauls, as
well as among the Greeks of the heroic age. We all know the
frequent expression of Homer, Gijixa xeJety, which is literally lo
display a signal, that is to say, to accumulate over the corpse of a
warrior a sufficient number of spadefuls of earth to signalize it, for
the worship and admiration of posterity. Tradition ascribes those
tumuli which are yet to be seen on the plain of Troy to the
observance of this custom. The funerary architecture of Egypt commenced in the same
fashion, in those distant ages which were called by the Egyptians
themselves the times of Hor-schcsoti or slaves of Horus. We cannot doubt that the pyramid sprang from the mound. Its birth
must have taken place after Menes had, by uniting the various
tribes under his own sceptre, caused the whole race to take a distinct
step onwards in civilization. The pyramid is but a built mound.
It is a tumulus in which brick and stone take the place of earth.
This substitution adds very greatly to its chances of duration, and
makes it a much safer place of deposit and a much more lasting monument for the body committed to its charge. The Nile mud, when moulded and dried in the sun, gave bricks which still remain
good ; their manufacture and their constructive use seem to have been understood by the Egyptians as soon as they emerged from
primitive barbarism. Thanks to the facilities thus afforded, thev
were enabled to build monuments upon the graves of their rulers
which could offer a better resistance to injuries of time and human
enemies than a few handfuls of earth and grass. They began,
perhaps, by placing a few blocks of stone upon their mounds, so as
to fix them more securely, or by covering them with a thin coat of
brickwork. But, after a few experiments in that direction, they
found it better to construct the whole body of the tumulus in the
harder material. Its size increased with the constructive skill and
material appliances of its builders, until it became first a hillock and
finally a mountain of stone, with the impenetrable rock for its base
and flanks of solid masonry.
The built-up tumulus of masonry took a form very different, in
its definite lines, from the rounded slopes of the mound. The
squared forms of brick or cut stone infallibly give to the edifice
upon which they are employed one of those more or less rigid forms which are defined by geometry. When they leave the hands
of the builder they are either cubes or parallelopipeds, pyramids

or prisms, cylinders or cones. They present the general appear
ance, they possess the essential properties, of one of those forms.
\\"e may say that architecture was born on the day when man
began to use the unyielding materials by which definite geome
trical forms can alone be given. As soon as this early development
was reached he set to work to combine those elementary forms in
different proportions and to add to their effect by elegance and
richness of decoration, and so in the end to form national
architectures.
When the first pyramid was buiit upon the borders of the desert
man was on the threshold of the movement to which we have
referred. The form adopted for the royal tomb was one of the most simple which could be chosen for a building. The most
simple of all would have been the tcfralicdron, or pyramid built
upon a triangular base. But not a single pyramid of that kind has
been discovered in Egypt. The whole of the pyramids, large or
small, are built upon a right-angled base, and in most instances
upon one with sides practically equal. ^ Mystic reasons for this
shape have been given. It has been said that each face was dedicated to one of the four powers of Amen, which corresponded
to the cardinal points of heaven." We are not yet sufficiently well
acquainted with the genesis of the Egyptian religion to be able to
decide how far into the past the four powers of Amen may be
traced : but it is quite possible that they were derived from the
four faces of the strictly oriented pyramids. Were we inclined to
enter into this discussion we should rather, perhaps, attribute the
shape of the pyramid to the prevailing Egyptian desire to turn one
face of their tombs towards the west, the abode of the dead, and
another to the east, whence the hoped-for resurrection was to
come. The three-sided pyramid would not have lent itself to such an arrangement.
There is also something unpleasant to the eye in the sharp
angles which form the three arttcs of the tetrahedron ; it looks as if
there had been a lack of material, and as if the structure would
suffer in consequence. The four-sided pyramid has more dignity
and more amplitude ; its four faces, placed back to back in pairs,

seem to counterpoise and sustain each other in a fashion which is
impossible in the case of the tetrahedron.
The one characteristic possessed in common by those rehcs of
the Ancient Empire which we call pyramids, is their four-sided
ness. To an attentive observer these buildings offer more
diversities than would at first sight be believed. From Meidoum
in the south to Abou-Roash in the north is a distance of 43^
miles as the crow flies. Between these two points, which may

which have been e.xamined by Lepsius. Now, in this whole number there are not two which resemble each other in all
particulars, or which seem to be copies of one model. We do not

hiq^h respectively, while at their feet are several little pyramids
which hardly exceed from 50 to 70 feet of vertical height.
Between these two extremes many of intermediate sizes may be inserted. The Stepped Pyramid, near Sakkarah, is about 190
feet hieh ; the largest of those at Abousir is about 165 ; one of
those at Dashour is not quite 100 feet. These differences in
height are easily explained by one of those national habits to which we have already alluded. Every Egyptian, as soon as he arrived
at years of discretion, set about building his own tomb. He dug the well and the mummy chamber, he caused the sarcophagus to
be carved and the funerary chapel to be built. It often happened

that those who had ordered such works died long before they were
finished, and it would seem that their heirs were content with
doing no more than was strictly necessary. They placed the
mummy in its grave with the prescribed ceremonies, they filled up
the well and sealed the private parts of the tomb ; but being
occupied with the preparations for their own funeral, they did not
continue the decoration of the chapel, which thenceforward
remained //i statu quo. Thus only can we explain the state in
which several important tombs have been discovered both at
Memphis and at Thebes. On one wall we find paintings and
sculptures carried out with the greatest care and finish, while on

another nothing is to be seen but the first rough outhne, in red
paint, by the artist charged with the undertaking. The comple
tion of the work must have been suddenly arrested by the death
of the destined inhabitant of the tomb.
It was the same with the sepulchres of the kings. Each sovereign
began the construction of his pyramid as soon as he found himself
upon the throne. But, in case his life and his reign should be cut
short, he began with those constituents of the tomb which were
absolutely necessary. He pressed on the work until he had raised
a pyramid of moderate size with its mummy chamber. When this
point had been reached, his immediate anxiety came to an end ;
but that was no reason for interrupting the course of the work.
The higher and wider his pyramid, the more efficient a guardian
of his body would it be, and the more impressive would be the
message carried down by it to posterity as to the power of its
builder. Year after year, therefore, he emplo)'ed crowds of im
pressed workmen to clothe it in layer after layer of dressed stone
or brick, so that the edifice raised in comparative haste at the
beeinnine of his reisfn, became in time nothing but the nucleus or
kernel of one many times its size.^ The construction was thus
begun in the centre and was developed outwards, like the timber
of a tree in successive years. As the pyramid grew in extent and
height, each successive coat, so to speak, required more hands and
more time. We have no reason to believe that each coat had to
be finished within a certain period, and so it would be futile to
attempt to found any calculation as to the duration of the different
reigns upon the number of these concentric layers ; but we may
assert in a general way that the highest pyramids correspond to
the longest reigns. We know, by the witness of ancient authors,
that the kings who built the three great pyramids at Gizeh, namely,
Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus, each reigned about sixty years.
History thus confirms the truth of the induction which arises from
' This method of construction may be easily recognised in the Pyramid of Meidouni. That curious structure was built in concentric layers round a nucleus. These layers are by no means equal in the excellence either of the workmanship or of the materials employed. Some show supreme negligence ; in others we find the builders of the Ancient Empire and their materials both at their best. The same fact has been observed in regard to the Stepped Pyramid and the pyramids at Abousir. It would seem that the work was assigned in sections to different corvees, whose consciences varied greatly in elasticity. (Mariette, Voyag;e de la HauteEgypte, p. 45-)

structive processes made use of by the architects of the pyramids.^
The author of Baedeker's Guide has not been content with
believing, Hke Perring, Lepsius, and Mariette, that the pyramid
grew by the appHcation of successive envelopes of stone round the
central mass, either in horizontal courses or in courses sloping
towards the axis of the building. He has brought forward an
elaborate theory of construction, which, though very ingenious,
encounters several grave objections. We shall point out those
objections while we endeavour to explain the system itself by the
help of special illustrations drawn for us by the author of the
Guide in question. '-'

in its primitive integrity must have amounted to a total of
3,479,600 cubic yards. Even now, when so much of its substances has been detached and carried away, there still remains the
enormous mass of 3,246,600 cubic yards. Supposing that, two
or three years after the commencement of a work upon this colossal
scale, death had carried off its projector, can we believe that any
successor, even a son who was sincerely devoted to the memory of
his father, would have burthened himself with the continuation and
completion of such an enterprise ? The new sovereign would have
enough to do in commencing and carrying on the erection of his
own tomb, and, moreover, would be irresistibly tempted to make use, for its construction, of the accumulated material and collected
labour of his predecessor. Even four or five thousand years before our era, men were too
sagacious to reckon upon the piety or gratitude of an heir. For
the closing and final sealing up of the pyramid, its builder and
destined inhabitant was obliged to depend upon his survivors, he
could not do it himself. Moreover, the external completion,
which, in the case of the greater monuments, must have been a
long and costly matter, had to be entrusted to the same hands.
The reigning king, so long as he was not too sternly reminded of
the end by disease or the infirmities of age, must have felt great
reluctance to order the cessation of the work which had gone on
under his own eye for so many years, or to arrest that course of
sliown in the annexed woodcut. He concludes that a large part of the material of those pyrainids \va^ obtained upon their sites, and quarried above the level at which

the Stones were finally placed. He cites Herodotus (ii. 125)33 conveying in an imperfect form the tradition that the pyramids were "constructed from above."



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 203
development Avhich, after being a continual source of pride and
pleasure to himself, might end in giving him a monument surpass
ing those of his famous predecessors. He was, therefore, very
likely to be surprised by death with his tomb still unfinished, with
the final cope-stone still upon the ground, or, even when that had
been put in place so as to show the total height, with the casing of
polished stone which was destined to hide the inner courses of the
masonry and the entrances, still incomplete. Upon two-thirds or
three-quarters of each face, his pyramid would still present the
aspect which necessarily belonged to it during the period of its
construction ; an aspect which has again distinguished the great
pyramid since it was despoiled of its casing. As each course was
set back from that upon which it was placed, the final ensemble
looked like an enormous staircase with steps gradually diminishing
in leno-th as thev neared the summit. There were many of the Egyptian princes who from want of
patience or zeal, or from some other motive, failed to carry on the
enterprise of their predecessors to its destined conclusion. We
are ignorant as to the condition of the three great pyramids of
Gizeh at the death of their projectors. But they appear to
have been finished in most of their details with a care which would
seem to indicate that Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus, must have
been there to overlook the smallest details of their execution.
Other pyramids, on the other hand, seem to have been left in a
comparatively imperfect state.
These observations furnish us with an initial objection to the
theory to which we have referred. Some may refuse to believe that Cheops intended from the beginning that his pyramid should have the dimensions and the internal arrangements which we now
see. But why should he not have done so ? If he had died at
the end of a few years, his pyramid would, perhaps, have presented
to us a shape like that of some other edifices of the same kind, a
large base which had never received either its cope-stone or its
casing. So too with those of Mj-cerinus and Chephren. Have
not absolute monarchs existed at all times, whose infinite power
seems to have made them forget the eternal limits of time
and space ? Sometimes Fortune has been cruel to them ;
but often she seems to have placed herself entirely at their
disposal.
Among the causes which combine to make the roj-al tombs of



204 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
the first six dynasties so unequal in height and appearance, the
very unequal length of the reigns is the most important. If we
were better acquainted with the condition of Egypt in those
remote epochs, we should, no doubt, be enabled to give other
reasons for their want of uniformity. The chances of completion
and even of preservation in its complete state enjoyed by a pyramid must have greatly depended upon the descent of the crown. When king succeeded king in one family those chances
were much better than when dynasty succeeded dynasty, whether
the break were due to internal revolution or to the failure of the
legitimate line. It is even possible that some of those pyramids
which are now to outward appearance mere heaps of ddbris
never received the mummy for whose reception they were
designed and built.
The pyramids differ also in the materials employed. The
great pyramids at Gizeh are built of fine limestone from Mokattam
and Toura ; the chief one at Sakkarah of a bad clayish limestone from the neighbouring rocks ; at Dashour and Abou-Roash there
are pyramids of unburnt brick. Finally there are pyramids built
chiefly of stone which is kept in place by a carefully constructed
skeleton, so to speak, of brick. This construction is to be found
in the pyramid of lllahoun, at the entrance to the Fayoum
(Fig. 131);
There is the same variety in the position of the mummy
chamber. Sometimes this is within the sides of the pyramid itself,
as in that of Cheops; sometimes, after the example of the mastaba,
it is cut out of the living rock upon which the pyramid stands.
This arrangement is to be found, for instance, in the pyramid of
Mycerinus, where the roof of the mummy chamber is about 33
feet below the lowest course of the pyramid itself So too in the Stepped Pyramid, where the whole complicated system of
corridors and cells, which distinguishes that edifice, is cut in the
rock, so that the building itself is absolutely solid. Most of the
pyramids have no more than one or two entrances, giving access
to narrow galleries, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending,
which lead to one or two chambers of very small dimensions when compared to the enormous mass which rises above and around them (Fig. 132). In the subterranean part of the Stepped Pyramid
the proportion of voids to solids is far less insignificant. This
pyramid, which is not nearly so carefully oriented as the others.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empikk. 20:
has four entrances and a series of internal passages, horizontal
galleries, staircases and cells, which make it little else than a
subterranean labyrinth. It is singular also in having, upon its
central axis and at the point upon which, at various heights, all its
galleries converge, a sort of large well, a chamber about twenty
feet square and eighty feet high, in the pavement of which a huge
block of granite cut into the shape of a cork or plug was so placed
as to open at wilj ^ and leave a free passage for the descent into a second chamber, the purpose of which is more than obscure, as it
is too small even to have contained a sarcophagus.- The end of

the long passage which leads to the thirty chambers which have
been counted beneath this pyramid has been found in the
neighbouring sands (Fig. 134).
Another point of difference : most of the pyramids are built
round a core of living rock, which is embraced by the lower
courses of their masonry. But the pyramid of Mycerinus is just
the reverse of this. It is built over a hollow in the rock which is
filled up with masonry. The inequalities of the surface were
usually taken advantage of so as to economize material, and make

a greater show with less labour. Mycerinus, however, did not
fear to increase his task by rearing his pyramid over a depression
in the plateau.
There is no less diversity in the external aspects of the
pyramids. We are most familiar with the shapes of the great pyramids at Gizeh (Fig. 130 and PI. I, 2); their images have been multiplied to infinity by engraving and photography, but we make a great mistake when we imagine all the royal tombs at
Memphis to be built upon this one model. They do not all
present the same simplicity of form, the same regular slope from
summit to base, or the smooth and polished casing which distin
g;uished those great monuments when they were in complete

preservation. The southern pyramid of Dashour otters us one
of the most curious variations upon the original theme (Fig. 133).
Its angle-ridges are not unbroken straight lines from base to
summit. The slope of its faces becomes less steep at about
half their height. The lower part of its sides make angles of
54° 41' with the horizon, while above they suddenly fall back to
an angle of 42° 59'. This latter slope does not greatly differ from
the 43" 36' of the other pyramid in the same neighbourhood. No
indication has yet been discovered as to the builder of this pyramid.
A second variation, still more unlike the Gizeh type, is to be

found in the great pyramid of Sakkarah, the Stepped Pyramid,
which was considered by Mariette as the oldest of them all.
Taking a passage from Manetho as his authority, he thought
himself justified in attributing it to the fourth king of the first
dynasty, Ouenephes or Ata, and he was inclined to see in it the

from 38 feet 2 inches to 29 feet 6 inches. The width of each step
is nearly 7 feet. It will be seen, therefore, that this building
rather tends to the pyramidal form than achieves it ; it is a rough
sketch for a pyramid.
Does this want of completion result from accidental causes,



2oS A History of Art i\ Ancient Egypt.
or must it be referred to ignorance of the full beauties of the
pyramidal form on the part of its builders ? If the conjecture
of Mariette is well founded, the Stepped Pyramid is not only the
most ancient building in Egypt but in the whole world ; and
in the remote century which witnessed its construction men may
not yet have learnt to fill up the angles left in their masonry, they
may have been quite satisfied to leave their work in a condition
which to us seems imperfect.
The Germans have evolved a complicated system of con
struction from notes made by Lepsius upon the details of the
masonry in different pyramids. In order that this system may
be more easily understood, we give, on the opposite page, a series
Fig. 135. — The Stepped Pyramid ; restored from the measurements of Perring.
of representations of such a pyramid in different stages of com
pletion (Figs. 136 to 142). A commencement was made by erecting a very narrow and perpendicular pyramid crowned by a pyramidion, like a stumpy obelisk (Fig. 136). This finished,
sloping masses were erected against it so as to form, with the
pyramidion of the first mass, a second pyramid. The apex of this
pyramid, a pyramidion of a single stone, might be put in place and
the work considered finished (Fig. 137) ; or, if the builder were
sanguine as to time, he might seek to push on still farther.
Then, at the line where the slopes of the pyramid left the earth, four
perpendicular walls were erected to the height of the pyramidion.
The space between the sides of the pyramid and the inner faces



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 209
of these walls was filled in, and thus a kind of terrace, or huge
rectangular block, was obtained (Fig. 138), which served as the core for a new pyramid (Fig. 139). This again disappeared under
a pyramid of larger section and gentler slope (Fig. 140), whose
sides reached the ground far beyond the foundations of the terrace.
In the case of a long reign this operation might be repeated over

and over again (Figs. 140 and 142). A large pyramid would
thus be composed of a series of pyramidal envelopes placed one
upon another. The mummy-chamber was either cut in the rock
before the laying of the first course of stone, or it was contrived
in the thickness of the masonry itself; as the casing of stone went
on increasing in thickness, galleries were left for ventilation and

for the introduction of the sarcophagus and the mummy. The mummy-chamber is always found either upon the axis of the pyramid, or in its immediate neighbourhood, and always nearer
the base than the summit. We are told that the system of construction here set forth is
rendered almost certain by the fact that " the deeper we penetrate
into the pyramid the more careful do we find the construction,
which becomes more and more careless as the exterior is approached. In fact, as each new envelope was commenced,
the chances of its being completed became less." The mass of
stone to be worked and placed was greater, while the king, upon
whose life the whole operation depended, was older and nearer
his death. The builders became less sure of the morrow ; they
pressed on so as to increase, at all hazards, the size of the monu
ment, and trusted to the final casingr to conceal all defects of
workmanship. This system of pyramid building would explain the curious shapes which we have noticed in the Stepped Pyramid and the
southern pyramid of Dashour.^ Both of those erections would
thus be unfinished pyramids. At Sakkarah, the angles left by the
successive stages would be waiting for their filling in ; at Dashour, the upper part of a pyramid of gentle slope would have been
constructed upon the nucleus which was first erected, but the
continuation of the slope to the ground would have been pre
vented by the stoppage of the works at the point of intersection of
the upper pyramid and its provisional substructure. Hence the
broken slope which has such a strange effect, an effect which could
not have entered into the original calculations of the architect.
But although this theory seems satisfactorily to explain some
puzzling appearances, it also, when tested by facts, encounters
some very grave objections. The explorers of the pyramids have
more than once, in their search for lost galleries and hidden
chambers, cut for themselves a passage through the masonry, but
neither in these breaches made by violence, nor in the ancient and
1 There are other stepped pyramids besides that at Sakkarah. Jomard describes one of crude and much crumbled brick at Dashour. It is, he says, about 140 feet high. Its height is divided into five stages, each being set back about 1 1 feet behind the one below. These steps are often found, he adds, among the southern pyramids, and there is one example of such construction at Gizeh. {Description de VEgypte, vol. x., p. 5.) At Matarieh, between Sakkarah and Meidoum, there is a pvTamid with a double slope like that at Dashour.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 2 1

carefully constructed passages to which they were the means of
giving access, have any signs been, discovered, or at least,
reported, of the junctions of different surfaces and slopes which
must have existed according to the theory which we are noticing.
We should expect, at least, to find the nearly upright sides of
the cubic mass with which the pyraniid began, contrasting with the
comparatively gentle slopes which were built against it. These
different parts of the pyramid, we are told, were built and fin
ished separately, a proceeding which, if the later parts were to be
properly fitted to the earlier and the final stability of the monument assured, would have demanded a minute and scrupulous care which was not common with Egyptian workmen. How, without
numerous through bonding-stones, could those slides and settlements be prevented to which the want of homogeneity in the
structure would otherwise be sure to lead ? But we are not told
that any such junctions of old and new work are to be found even
in those points where they would be most conspicuous, namely, in
the galleries leading to the internal chambers, where a practised
eye could hardly fail to note the transition. We do not say that
there are no such transitions, but we think the advocates of the
new theory should have begun by pointing them out ii they exist.
There is another difficulty in their way. How is their system
to explain the position of the mummy-chamber in certain pyra
mids ? Let us take that of Cheops as an example. If its internal
arrangements had been fixed irom the beginning, if the intention
had been from the first to place the mummy-chamber where we
now find it, at about one-third of the whole height, why should the
builders have complicated their task by imposing upon themselves
these ever difficult junctions ? Wouki it not have been far better
to build the pyramid at once to the required height, leaving in its
thickness the necessary galleries ? The same observation applies to the discharging chambers above the mummy-chamber. The
whole of these arran<jements, the his:h vestibule with its wonderful
jiiasonry, the chambers and the structural voids above them,
appear to have been conceived and carried out at one time, and
by the same brains and hands. Not a sign is to be found of those
more or less well-veiled transitions which are never absent when
the work of one time and one set of hands has to be united with
that of another. Or are we to believe that they commenced by
building a hill of stone composed of those different jjyramids one



2 12 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
within anotlier, and that they afterwards carved the necessary
chambers and corridors out of its mass ? One of the heroes of
Hoffmann, the fantastic Crespel, made use indeed of some such
method in giving doors and windows to his newly-built house, but
we may be sure that no architect, either in Egypt or elsewhere,
ever thought of employing it. The disintegration to which it
would lead may easily be imagined.
We may here call attention to a circumstance which justifies all our reserves. There is but one pyramid which seems to have
been built upon a system which, though much less complicated,
resembled that which we are noticing in some degree, we mean
the .Stepped Pyramid of Sakkarah. Now we find that the whole of the complicated net-work of chambers and passages in that
pyramid is cut out of the living rock beneath its base, and that
they are approached from without by subterranean passages.
The difficulty of deciding upon the position of the chambers in
advance, and of constructing the galleries through the various
slopes of the concentric masses which were to form the pyramid,
was thus avoided, and the builder was able to devote all his
attention to increasing the size of the monument, by multiplying
those parallel wedges disposed around a central core of which it is composed. The observations made by Lepsius in the Stepped Pyramid and in one at Abousir seem to prove that some pyramids were con
structed in this manner. In both of those buildings all necessary
precautions were taken to guard against the weaknesses of such
a system. It is difficult to understand how separate slices of
masonry, placed one upon the other in the fashion shown by the section which we have borrowed from Perring's work (Fig. 134), could have had sufficient adherence one to another. Lepsius
made a breach in the southern face of this pyramid, and the
examination which he was thus enabled to institute led him to
suggest a rather more probable system of construction. Upon
the external sloping face of each step he found two casing-walls,
but these did not extend from the ground to the apex of the
monument, they reached no higher than the single step, so that
they found a true resisting base in the flat mass (see Fig. 143)
upon which they rested. Moreover, the architect provided for
the lateral tying of the different sections of his work, as Lepsius
proves to us by a partial section of the pyramid of Abousir.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 213
Two walls of fine limestone blocks inclose a fillinj^ in of rubble,
to which they are bound by perpend stones which penetrate its
substance. This method of construction has its faults, but it is
so rapid that its employment is not to be wondered at.

the rock. This curious arrangement should be studied upon the spot by some competent observer. As we do not know whether these curves exist upon each face or not, or whether they meet
each other and penetrate deeply into the structure or not, we cannot say what their purpose may have been. But however this may
be, they afford another argument against the notion that all the great pyramids were built round such a pyramidoid core as that
represented by our Fig. 136. We fear that this system must be
regarded merely as an intellectual plaything. The views of
Lepsius as to the enlargement of the pyramid by the addition of
parallel slices are worthy of more respect, and their truth seems to
be demonstrated in the case of some pyramids. But these all
belong to that category of monuments which have subterranean

chambers only. We have yet to learn that they were ever made use of in those pyramids which inclose the mummy-chamber and
its avenues in their own substance. Variety is universal in
that Egypt which has so often been described as the land of
uniformity and immobility— no two of the pyramids resemble each other exactly.
We have yet to speak of two ancient monuments in which some
would recognize unfinished pyramids, namely, the Pyramid of Meidoum and the Mastabat-el-Faraoun. We do not aeree with
this opinion, which has, however, been lately put forward, so
far, at least, as the former monument is concerned. ^ These two

sepulchres seem to us to represent a different type of funerary
architecture, a type created by the ancient empire, and meriting
special notice at our hands. The monument which rises so conspicuously from the jalain near
the village of iMeidoum on the road to the Fayoum, is called by
Arabs the Haram-el-Kabbab, or "the false pyramid.'' It is, in
fact, not so much a pyramid, strictly speaking, as a mass formed
of three square towers with slightly inclined sides superimposed
one upon the other, the second being less in area than the first,
and the third than the second. The remains of a fourth story
may be distinguished on the summit of the third ; some see in
them the remains of a small j^yramid, others those of a cone.
Judging from the names found in the neighbouring mastabas,

which were opened and examined by ]\Iariette, this is the tomb
of Snefrou I., one of the greatest kings of the third dynasty.^ The Mastabat-el-Faraoun or " Seat of Pharaoh," as the Arabs
call it, is a huge rectangular mass with sloping sides ; it is about
66 feet high, 340 long, and 240 deep. It is oriented like the pyramids. It is a royal tomb with internal arrangements which
resemble those in the pyramid of Mycerinus ; the same sloping
galleries, the same chambers, the same great lateral niches.
Upon a block lying at the foot of the structure of which it had once formed a part, Mariette found a quarry-mark traced in red ochre which seemed to him to form part of the name of
Ounas, one of the last kings of the fifth dynasty (Figs. 109
and 147).

Upon the platform of the Mastabat-el-Faraoun certain blocks
are to be found which, from their position, must have been
bonding-stones. They seem to hint, therefore, either that the
structure was never finished, or that it has lost its former crown.
The latter hypothesis is the more probable. Among the titles of

people buried in the necropolis at Sakkarah, we often come upon
those of priests attached to the service of some monument with a
form similar to that represented by our Fig. 148. Who can say
asks Mariette, that it is not the Mastabat-el-Faraoun itself?^
M. Mariette cites, in support of this
conjecture, certain other structures of a
similar character, such as the large tomb
situated near the south-eastern angle of
the second pyramid at Gizeh, and the
little monument which is called the
Pyramid of Righa. From these he
concludes that the principles of the mastaba and the pyramid were sometimes
combined under the ancient empire.
The royal tombs in the Memphite region were not always pyramids, they were sometimes composed of a mastaba and of one
or more high square tower-like erections upon it, the whole ending
in one of those small pyramids which we call pyramidions. This

The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 217
type allowed of numerous combinations, many of which are to be
discovered in the monuments of a later period. The pyramid was employed as a terminal form throughout the whole of Egyptian history. Both Thebes and Abydos offer us
many examples of its use, either in those sepulchral edifices which
are still extant, or in the representations of them upon bas-reliefs.
But the pyramid properly speaking was confined to the Wemphite
period. The princes of the twelfth dynasty seem to have constructed some in the Fayoum. The pyramids of Hawara and
lUahoon correspond to those which, we are told, were built in
connection with the labyrinth and upon the islands of Lake Mceris
respectively. These, so far as we can judge, were the last of the
pyramids. There are, indeed, in the necropolis of Thebes, upon
the rocks of Drah-abou'1-neggah, a few pyramids of crude brick,
some of which seem to belong to Entefs of the eleventh dynasty ;
but they are small and carelessly constructed.^ When the art of
Egypt had arrived at its full development, such purely geometrical
forms would seem unworthy of its powers, as they did not allow
of those varied beauties of construction and decoration which its
architects had gradually mastered.
The pyramids have never failed to impress the imaginations of
those foreign travellers who have visited Egypt. Their venerable
antiquity ; the memories, partly fable, partly history, which were
attached to them by popular tradition ; their colossal mass and the
vast space of ground which they covered, at the very gates of the capital and upon the boundary between the desert and the
cultivated land, all combined to heighten their effect. Those
nations who came under the living influence of Egypt could
hardl)^ then, escape from the desire to imitate her pyramids in
their own manner. We shall find the pyramidal form employed
to crown buildings in Phoenicia, Judaea, and elsewhere. But the
kingdom of Ethiopia, the southern annexe of Egypt and the
copyist of her civilization, was the chief reproducer of the
Egyptian pyramid as it was created by the kings of the ancient empire. Napata, Meroe, and other jalaces have pyramids which
may be counted by dozens. Like those in Egypt, they are
the tombs of the native monarchs.
We shall not attempt any study of these remains. Like all the

other products of Ethiopian art, they are neither original nor
interesting. The people who inhabited the region which we now
call by the names of Nubia and the Soudan, had, indeed,
reconquered their political independence a thousand years before
our era, but they were not gifted by nature with power to
assimilate the lessons of their former masters. Even during the short period when the Ethiopian monarchs reigned over a divided and weakened Egypt, Ethiopia remained the clumsy
pupil and imitator of the northern people. She never learnt to
give to her royal pyramids the air of grandeur which distin
guishes the great structures of Memphis. The Ethiopian
pyramids were generally so narrow and steep in slope that
their whole character was different from those of Egypt. In
Egypt the base line was always greater than the vertical height,
upon the Upper Nile the proportions were reversed.^ The
latter edifices thus lost some of that appearance of indestructible
solidity which is their natural expression. They remind one
at once of the obelisk and the pyramid. Add to this that an
unintelligent taste overspread them with ill-devised decoration.
Thus the upper part of their eastern faces, for they are
oriented, generally bears a false window surmounted by a cornice, about as incongruous an ornament as could well be
conceived, and one which expresses nothing either to the eye
or the mind.
We shall, therefore, take no further notice of these more or
less ill-designed variations upon the type which was created
by the Egyptians in the early days of their civilization and fully
understood by themselves alone. We must return, however, to that type for a moment, in
order to show, in as few words as possible, how far the art of
workinsf and fixine stone had advanced even at the time of
the first dynasties. The Great Pyramid affords us a curious example of the
elaborate precautions taken against the violation of the royal tomb (Fig. 132). At the point where the ascending gallery
' Thus the Great Pyramid was 4S2 feet high, while the length of one side at the base is 764 feet. On the other hand, the " third pyramid " at Gebel-Barkal (Napata) is 35 feet square at the base and 60 feet high ; the " fifth" is 39 feet square at the base and nearly 50 feet high. Their proportions are not constant, but the height of the Nubian pyramids is always far greater than the length of one side at its base.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 219
branched off from that descending' corridor which was the only
entrance to the pyramid, the mouth of the former was closed
by a block of granite which exactly fitted it. This block was so
heavy and so well adjusted, that entrance could only be obtained
by cutting a passage through the surrounding masonry, which,
being of limestone, did not offer such an unyielding resistance to the
tools brought against it. Formerly the mouth of a gallery, which
seemed to be the continuation of the entrance corridor, remained
open, and, when followed to the end, led to an unfinished
chamber cut in the rock at about the level of the Nile. If
this had been finished the waters would perhaps have invaded it by infiltration. This seems to have been intended by the
constructor, because Herodotus, who no doubt thought the work
had been completed, tells us of a subterranean conduit which
Fic 149. —Plan and eIe\ation of a iiyramicl at Meroe ; from Prisse.
admitted the waters of the Nile.^ The violaters of the tomb
would believe the corpse to be in this unsuspected reservoir, and
would search no farther, or if they guessed the deception and
persevered till they found the entrance to the ascending gallery,
they would find another obstacle to their success which would
be likely to arrest them longer than the first. The upper
extremity of the great gallery, at which we suppose them arrived,
opens upon a small vestibule which would still separate them
from the sarcophagus-chamber itself Four flat blocks ol
granite, sliding in grooves, masked the entrance to the latter

of nino slabs of fine red granite, like those which form the walls
of the same chamber. They are i8 feet 9 inches long and their

(see Fig. 152). Thanks to this succession of voids immediately over the main chamber, and to the pointed arch which surmounts
them, the vertical pressure of the superstructure is discharged
from the chamber itself and distributed over the lateral parts
of the pyramid. These precautions have been quite effectual.
Not a stone has been stirred either by the inward thrust or by
the crushing of their substance ; not a block is out of place but
those which have been disturbed by the violence of man ; and,
moreover, the whole structure is so well bonded and so well
balanced that even his violent attacks have led neither to dis
ruption nor settlement in the apartment of Cheops or in the
galleries which lead to it.^

The glory of the workmen who built the Great Pyramid is
the masonry of the Grand Gallery, the gallery which opens
immediately into the vestibule of the King's Chamber. As this
corridor is 28 feet high and 7 feet wide, the visitor can breathe
more freely than in the low and narrow passages which lead to
^ The discovery of these chambers was interesting from another point of view. The name of Choufou was found continually repeated upon the blocks of which they are formed. It was written in red ochre, and, in places, it was upside down, thus proving that it must have been written before the stones were put in place. It cannot therefore have been traced after the tradition which assigned the pyramid to Cheops, that is, to Khoufou, arose ; and so it affords conclusive corroboration of the statements of Herodotus.

it, and can examine at his ease the beautitul blocks of Hmestone from Mokattam of which its poHshed walls are composed. The
faces of these blocks have been dressed with a care which is not
to be surpassed even by the most perfect examples of Hellenic
architecture on the Acropolis at Athens. The internal faces must have been worked with equal care. No cement has been
employed in the fixing, and the adherence is so perfect that,
in the words of Abd-ul-Latif " not a needle, not even a hair,
can be introduced into the joints." ^ These joints arc not even
to be distinguished without careful examination. The roof
of this gallery is built with no less care.- Each of the upper
courses is slightly set off from the one below it, so that in time
they come so near together that the opening may be closed by
a sinsfle stone, or rather, row of stones. These, beinof held
between the two upper courses of a quasi vault, play the part of key stones. This method of vaulting has been employed in
other parts of the pyramid, especially in what is called the Queens
Chamber, which is almost directly beneath the king's, or sarcophagus
chamber. The same care is conspicuous in those linings of red granite which form the walls of the two chambers. Even the
fine limestone used for the walls of the Grand Gallery was not
considered rich and solid enough for the walls of the apartment
in which the prince in whose honour the whole of the colossal
edifice w'as reared would repose ; and it was determined to use
the richest and most costly material of which the Egyptian
architect could dispose.^ The plain sarcophagus, without either
inscription or ornament, which is still in the King's Chamber, is
also of red granite.
The external casing of the pyramid has entirely disappeared, as
we have already said. On account of their moderate size the

Jomard expresses himself to the same effect ahiiost in the same terms. {Description de l' Egypfe, vol. v. p. 628.) ^ The extremity of this gallery appears on the right of Fig. 152. ^ The presence of this lining in the " Queen's Chamber " also led to its being dubbed a funerary chamber, for no trace of a sarcophagus was found in it. If we had any reason to believe that the pyramid was built in successive wedges, we should look upon this as a provisional chamber, made before it was certain that the pyramid would attain its present dimensions. As the work went on, it would be decided that another, larger, and better defended chamber should be built. In this case the first may never have been used, and may always have been as empty as it is now.

stones of which it was composed would seem to be especially well
fitted for use in building those great cities which, after the collapse
of the ancient civilization, succeeded each other, under different
names, in the neighbourhood of the Memphite necropolis. This
casing seems to have been made of more than one kind of stone, if
we may believe an ancient text which has been interpreted by
Letronne with the skill and sagacity of which he has given so
many proofs.^
The author, named Philo, of a treatise upon the Seven Wonders of the World, tells us that the Egyptians employed upon
this work " the most brilliant and varied stones, which were
carefully fixed." He mentions as contributing to the splendid
result white marble, basalt, porphyry, and a green breccia from
Arabia, which must have been what is called verde antique. And
as for his white marble, it must have been the white limestone
from Mokattam, which, in its best strata, is almost as white and
fine in grain as marble. Marble, properly speaking, was only
introduced into Egypt by the Greeks, and that in very small
quantities, for the use of sculptors. Philo says nothing of granite,
but its use was so general that it must have found a place in the
scheme of decoration."
The various kinds of stone must have been so placed as to form
zones, and perhaps patterns, of different colours, white, red, black,
rose, green, and so on. To form an idea of the effect we must
think of Giotto's campanile at Florence and various other Italian
buildings of the same kind.
It has been questioned whether the testimony of this Philo is to be depended upon, as few of those who have busied themselves with the pyramids seem to have laid much stress upon it. It
seems to us to be worthy of great respect. We do not know
' These observations are to be found in one of the early works of Letronne. Their presence is in no way hinted at by the title, which is : Rechenhes Geographiqiies I'f Critiijues sur le Livre ' De mcnstcra orhis term'' (8vo. 1844). The treatise, IlEpt rmi kiTTa. 6ea/xaTojr, may have been written either by Philo of Heraclea or Philo of Byzantium. They both belonged to the third century before our era, but the bombastic style and numerous errors incline us to believe that the little work must have been from the pen of some unknown rhetorician of a later date.
- These are the words of Philo, which we have translated rather freely : —HoiKiAai

when Philo lived, but we know that the casinq- of the pyramid was
still in place, at least in part, durino- the Middle Ages, because in
the time of Abd-ul-Latif it had almost its original height, and its
ascent was still very difficult.^ On the other hand we have proofs that, although the author of the Seven Wonders of the World may
have written more in the tone of a rhetorician than of an eye
witness of the wonders which he describes, he took some of his
information from excellent sources. In fact with the exception of
Pliny, he is the only ancient writer who gives us an approxi
mately true statement of the length of the base line of Cheops'
Pyramid. While the measurements of other writers are very far
from accurate, the figure given by Philo is only 16 feet 6 inches in
excess of the truth. The idea of decorating such an expanse of
' According to the calculations of Letronne, the Great Pyramid must have been 482 feet high when it was complete. In the time of Diodorus it was slightly over 480 feet ; in that of Abd-ul-Latif it measured 477 feet 3 inches. In 1795 it was only 456 feet and a few inches, so that it lost about 24 feet in the course of eighteen centuries. This lowering of the summit was mainly caused by the destruction and removal of the outer casing. Since it disappeared the Arabs have been in the habit of loosening the stones on the top and launching them down the sides for the amusement of travellers ; the smooth casing alone could prevent such outrage as this. The common idea that the Pyramid of Cheops is the highest building in the world is erroneous. Even if we take its height when complete, it is surpassed by at least two modern buildings, as may be seen by the following table of the most lofty buildings now existing :

surface with varied colour was quite in accordance with Egyptian
taste. They loved polychromatic ornaments ; they covered every
available surface with the gayest hues ; they delighted in the
juxtaposition of the most brilliant tones. They could hardly
think of covering such an immense surface with paint, and as it
was necessary, in any case, to cover it with a smooth casing, it
would be no more difficult to employ many kinds of stone than
one. They would thus obtain a kind of gigantic mosaic which
may perhaps have been heightened in effect by the use of gold.
We know that the pyramidion of an obelisk was frequently gilded, and it is probable enough that similar means were sometimes
taken, in the case of the more magnificent and carefully finished
pyramids, to draw the eye to their topmost stone and thus to add
to the impression made by their height. No more fitting adorn
ment could be imagined for the sharp peak of a pyramid rising
nearly five hundred feet into the pure blue of an Egyptian sky.
But this is a conjecture which can never be verified. Even if
the topmost stone were still in place upon any of the pyramids it
would, after all these ages, have lost all traces of gilding ; but the
whole of those edifices have their apex more or less truncated. Even before our era, Diodorus found the Great Pyramid crowned
by a plateau six cubits square. It has sometimes been supposed that the pyramids, when complete, were terminated by such a plateau as that described by
Diodorus, and that it bore a statue of the king whose mummy
rested below. This hypothesis is founded upon the passage of
Herodotus which treats of the Lake Mceris. " There are," he
says, "in the middle of the lake, two pyramids, each fifty fathoms
high (309 feet) each of them is .surmounted by a
colossal stone statue seated upon a throne." ^ Herodotus insists
so often upon having seen the Labyrinth and Lake Moeris with
his own eyes, that we cannot affect to doubt his assertions ; we
shall therefore confine ourselves to a few observations upon
them.
In the descriptions which he gives of the three great pyramids, and among his comments upon the methods employed in their construction, Herodotus does not say a word which can be
construed into the most distant allusion to statues upon their
summits. If he had seen colossi perched upon those lofty
I Diodorus, i. 63. 64. - Herodotus, ii. 49.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 227
pedestals, or if he had heard trom his dragomans — whose
exaggerations he has elsewhere so naively reproduced—that they
had formerly existed, would he not have made some allusion to
them in that passage, at least, where he explains how they raised
such huge stones to so great a height, and describes the successive
stages in the construction of a pyramid ? ^ Would he not have
found room, in the elaborate antithetical passage in which he
contrasts the virtues of IMycerinus with the imaginary wickedness
of Cheops and Chephren, for moral and critical reflections called
up by the sight of their statues upon their respective pyramids ; still more if one of them had happened to be missing ? Would
he not have attempted, through some popular tradition, to have ac
counted for the presence of one statue and the absence of another ?
It is evident, therefore, that Herodotus neither saw any statues upon the Pyramids of Memphis nor had he any reason to suppose those
structures had ever been crowned in such a fashion. He lays
stress upon the seated statues of the pyramids in Lake Moeris
because they were new to him, because he had seen nothing of the
same kind in the neighbourhood of the ancient capital.
Unless we are very much mistaken, this superposition of a
colossus upon a pyramid was a novelty devised by the architects of the middle empire, when, under the Ousourtesens and Amenemhats, it was proposed to revive the pyramidal form of tomb with which the early Pharaohs had obtained such imposing
results. Although most conservative on the whole, the art of
Egypt attempted, at each period of renascence, to introduce new
combinations into the details, at least, of the ancient forms, and
this was one of the number.
Another innovation of the same kind is to be found in the
decoration which covered, ag-ain according to Herodotus,- another
I M. Maspero has given in the Aiinuaire de F Association pour FEnanu-agement des Etudes Grecques and elsewhere, several extracts from a commentary upon the second book of Herodotus, which we should like to see published in its entirety. We may point out more particularly his remarks upon the te.xt of the Greek historian in the matter of the 1,600 talents of silver which, he says, was the value of the onions, radishes, and garlic consumed by the workmen emi)loyed upon the Great Pyramid (ii. 125). He has no difficulty in showing that Herodotus made a mistake, for which he gives an ingenious and probable explanation. {Annuaire de 1875, p. 16.) ^ Herodotus, ii. 148. Diodorus (1. 89) speaks of the same pjTamid, and Strabo, who also appears to have seen it, asserts its funerary character (p. 1165, c). He says it was four plethra (393 feet) both in width and height. This last dimension



228 A History of Art i\ Ancient Egypt.
pyramid constructed at about the same time, namely, that which
formed one side of the Labyrinth. " It had," says the historian,
" forty fathoms, and it was sculptured with animals of large size.
The entrance was by a subterranean passage." From the Greek
word used {eyytyXv-n-rai) we see that Herodotus means that the
faces, or perhaps only the principal face, of this pyramid about
two hundred and fifty feet high, were covered with bas-reliefs. There is in Egypt no other example of a pyramid so decorated.
The architectural works of this period have almost entirely
vanished, but we may, perhaps, look upon it as one of their
characteristics that the bareness which they had inherited from
the early creators of Egyptian art, was relieved and adorned by
the intervention of the sculptor.
It was the desire for such ornament that made them convert
their pyramids into gigantic pedestals for statues. According
to all the analogies afforded by later ages, these statues must
have been those of the princes who built the pyramids in question.
We have no reason to suppose that any of the kings of the first
six dynasties erected any colossal figures like those which were
set up in such numbers by the Theban dynasties ; with the
single exception of the Sphinx, none of the statues left to us by
the ancient empire greatly exceed the natural size. But it is
evident that such figures as would be fit to crown the pyramids of Cheops and Chephren would have to be of extravagant size
even if no more than their general outlines were to be visible
from below. Seen from a point nearly 500 feet below, and in
consequence of the inclination of the pyramid faces, at some
considerable distance laterally, even a statue fifty feet high,
like the two colossi of Amenophis III. on the plain of Thebes,
would appear small enough to a spectator. Its artistic results
would be very slender, and yet its erection would require
prodigious mechanical efforts. It would have required all the
multitudes of labourers, the patience, and the time, which the Egyptians alone dared to expend upon their monuments. But
perhaps it may be said that these colossi were statues built-up
of comparatively small stones. To this we must answer that
every colossus as yet discovered in Egypt is a monolith. A
statue, of whatever size, made in different pieces would form
is obviously exaggerated, because in all the Egyptian pyramids that are known to us the shortest diameter of the base is far in excess of the height.



The Tomb under the Ancient Emph^e.
an exception to the whole practice of Egyptian sculpture as
we know it. Until such works are proved to exist we decline
to believe in them.
The problem was a much simpler one in the cases of the pyra
mids in Lake Moeris. They were not nearly so lofty. Accord
ing to Herodotus they were about 309 feet high, doubtless
including their statues. Situated as they were in the middle of the lake, Herodotus could not himself have measured them,
and his statement that they sank as far below the level of the
water as they rose above it is an obvious exaggeration. When
the bed of the lake was formed, two masses of rock were no doubt
reserved, as in the cases of the other pyramids, to form the
core of the projected edifices, and therefore it is likely enough
that the lowest courses of the constructions themselves dipped
but little below the surface of the lake.^ In his amazement at the scale upon which the Egyptian Ijuildings were conceived,
Herodotus has too often attributed excessive dimensions to
them ; thus he says that the height of the Great Pyramid was
eight plethra, or about 820 feet, nearly 340 feet in excess of
the truth. It is therefore probable that the figures which he
gives for the lake pyramids are also exaggerated. These
pyramids were, on account of their comparatively modest dimen
sions, much better adapted to the ideas of the Ousourtesens
and Amenemhats than the gigantic piles of Cheops, Chephren,
and Mycerinus.
Finally there is not a te.xt to be found, outside the pages of
Herodotus, which mentions pyramids surmounted by statues, and upon none of those monuments which in one way or another
bear representations of the pyramids are they shown in any other
way than with pointed summits. Thus do we find them in the
papyri, upon those steles of the Memphite necropolis which

By this it would ajjpear that, in excavatmg the bed, or a part of the bed, of the famous lake, a mass of earth was left in order to bear future witness to the depth of the excavation and tlie general magnitude of the work. This mass would probably be reveted with stone, and, in order that even when surrounded and almost hidden by water, its significance should
not be lost, the pyramids raised upon it were made exactly equal to it in height.

placed upon rectangular figures of various heiglits, is used as a

which are represented in reliefs, is there the smallest sign of a trun

have borne a statue.

connection with the worship of the sun. " The principal figure,"
says M. de Rouge, " is generally shown in a posture of adoration,
with his face turned to the sun. On his left hand is the invocation
to the rising, and on his rio-ht that to the settinsf sun. These
arrangements are modified in various ways, but they are always
upon the same genera lines as the orientation of the tombs
themselves." ^ These minute pyramids also end in a point
whether they be of basalt, granite, or calcareous stone, and it is
natural that we should look upon them as the faithful reproductions

upon a small scale of those great funerary monuments which
furnished a type, consecrated by the most venerable of the national
traditions, of that structure facing the four cardinal points which we may call the normal Egyptian tomb.
We may believe, then, that the pyramid of the ancient empire
terminated in a pyramidion. This apex once fixed in place, the
workmen charged with the final completion of the edifice worked
downwards from one course to another, covering the immense
steps which each face displayed five or six thousand years ago
and now displays again, with the final casing which protected ihem for so many centuries. Even Herodotus saw that this must
have been the method of completion.^ Any other way of
proceeding would have been too dangerous after the slope of the
sides had been made smooth and continuous by the completion of
the casing of polished granite. Workmen could only have kept
their footing upon such a surface, with its 51 or 52 degrees of
elevation, by means of a complicated arrangement of ropes and
ladders. And again, points of resistance could not have been
obtained for the elevation of the materials to ever increasing
heights without cutting or leaving holes in the casing, which
would afterwards have to be filled up. These difficulties would
have unnecessarily complicated an operation which was a simple
matter when begun from the top. The masons could then make
use of the steps for their own locomotion, and when the stones
were too large to be lifted from hand to hand, nothing could
be easier than to fi.K windlasses by which the largest blocks
could be raised with facility.
As the workmen approached the base they left above them an
ever increasing extent of polished surface, sloping at such an angle
that no foot could rest upon it, and forming the only safeguard
against the degradation of the pyramid by removing its copestone
or its violation by breaking into the passages Avhich led to the mummy-chamber. The casing gave to the pyramid those continuous lines which were necessary to make its beauty complete,
and, if the materials employed were varied in the way suggested,
it furnished colour effects which had their beauty also. But,
above all, it was a protection, a defensive armour. So long as
the pyramid preserved its cuirass intact, it was difficult tor those

who meditated violence to know where to begin their attack.
But this obstacle once pierced it was comparatively easy to learn
all the secrets of the building. The inner mass was much less
carefully built than the casing ; the joints were comparatively open,
and the stones were soft and easily cut. Hence we see that some
pyramids, especially those which were built of bricks, have been
reduced by the action of time into heaps of debris, in which the
pyramidal form is hardly to be recognised.
Philo, who seems to be so well informed, tells us with what
extreme care the casing was put in place. " The whole work,"
he says, " is so well adjusted, and so thoroughly polished, that the
v/hole envelope seems but one block of stone." ^ The pyramid of
Cheops has been entirely despoiled of its outer covering, and it is
to that of Mycerinus that we must now turn if we wish to have
some idea of the care with which the work was done. The lower
part of this pyramid is still covered with long blocks of the finest
granite, fixed and polished in the most perfect manner. At the
foot of the Great Pyramid several blocks have been found which
seem to have formed part of the casing of that edifice.- They
are trapezoidal in form, and they show, as Letronne " long ago
remarked, that the casing stones were placed one upon another,
and adjusted by their external faces. They were not, as was at
first supposed, sunk into the upper face of the course below by
mortices which would correspond to the trench in the living rock
in which the first course was fixed. As to whether the external
faces of these blocks were dressed to the required angle before
they left the quarry, or whether the work were done after they
were in place we cannot say with any certainty, but it is most
likely that the methods of proceeding changed with the progress
of time and the succession of architects. In such a matter we
should find, if we entered into details, diversity similar to that

" According to Jomard, the casing stones of the Great Pyramid were "a compact grey limestone, harder and more homogeneous than those of the body of the building " {Description tie F Egypte, t. v. p. 640) ; but according to Philo, this casing was formed, as we have already said, of various materials, so we need feel no surprise if blocks of granite or other rock are shown to have formed jart of it.

which we have already shown to have characterized the forms of
the pyramids, their internal arrangements, and the materials of
which they were composed. Thus some triangular prisms ot granite have been found at the foot of the pyramid of Chephren, which seem to have formed part
of its lower casing.^ Such a section seems, upon paper, the
simplest that could be adopted for the filling in of the angle
between two of the steps, but it is far inferior in solidity to the
trapezoidal section. The prisms had no alliance one with another ;
they had to depend for their security entirely upon their adherence
to the faces of the graded core, so that they could easily be carried
off, or become dislocated from natural causes. This system, unlike
the first described, did not give a homogeneous envelope with a
thickness of its own, and partly independent of the monument
which it protected.

The casing of the Second Pyramid, moreover, does not seem to
have been carried out on the same principle from top to bottom.
' B.EDEKF.R, Egyft, parti, p. 338 (ed. of 187S). Herodotus (ii. 127) says that the first course of the Great Pyramid was built of a parti-coloured Ethiopian stone
(iiTToStt'/ias Toi' TrpwTov So/xoi' \iOov AWtoTTLKov TToiKiXov), By Ethiopian stone we must understand, as several illustrations prove, the granite of Syene. The Greek historian seems to have thought that the whole of the first course, throughout the thickness of the pyramid, was of this stone. His mistake was a natural one. In his time the pyramid was in a good state of preservation, and he never thought of asking whether or no the core was of the same material as the outer case. 2 On the other hand, these awkwardly shaped prisms offered less inducement to those who looked upon the pyramids as open quarries than the easily squared blocks of Cheops, while their position in the angles of the internal masonry enabled them
to keep their places independently of the lower courses of the casing. — En.

The upper part, which still remains in place, is composed of a
hard cement formed of chalk, gypsum, and pieces of burnt brick.
They may have wished to obtain the parti-coloured effect of which
Philo speaks, by making simultaneous use of granite and concrete,
and it is quite possible that yet other materials entered into the
composition of the casing.^
In other pyramids we find different combinations again. In
the double-sloped erection at Dashour, the courses of casing
stones are vertical instead of horizontal,^ while a brick pyramid

the most northern — in the same locality, was covered with
slabs of limestone, fixed, no doubt, with mortar. Sometimes we find the revetment in a state of semi-completion ;
the blocks in place, and cut to the proper angle, but without their
final polish. Such is the case with the Second Pyramid, upon
which blocks of granite are to be found which are still rough in
face. It would seem that the patience required for the minute
completion of such a terribly long and tedious piece of work was
not forthcoming. But we ought in fact to be surprised, not so much
at the unfinished state of a pyramid here and there, but rather that
they should ever have been completed.
The variety which is so conspicuous in the architectural con
struction of the pyramids is also to be found in their epigraphy.
The first explorers of the Pyramids of Gizeh were surprised at the
absence of all inscriptions beyond the masons' marks ; the silence
of those enormous structures seemed amazing ; but soon Colonel Vyse discovered in the pyramid of Mycerinus the sarcophagus of
that king, and the mummy case, now in the British Museum,
which bears an inscription of some length. Recent discoveries,
too, of which full details are yet wanting, prove that some of the
pyramids contained long texts, which contain the names of kings
and other information which is of great importance to the historian
of the Egyptian religion. In 1879 and 1880, Mariette caused three pyramids at Sakkarah to be opened, which until then had
' The determination to use a concrete such as that described affords a good reason for the prismatic shape of the granite blocks used in the lower courses. It would evidently be easy enough to cover the pyramid with a coat of cement

working downwards —if its surface did not greatly overpass the salient angles of the steps, while the difficulty would be enormously increased if the coat were to have a considerable thickness of its own independently of the pyramid, like the casing
shown in Fig. 155.

The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 235
remained unexplored. One of them was silent and empty, but in
the others the inscriptions and sarcophagi of two kings of the
sixth dynasty, Papi and his son Merenzi, were found. Fragments of a Ritual of the Dead were recognized among them.
Pleasure at this discovery, the last which he was destined to
make in the soil of Egypt, brightened the last days of Mariette.^
In March 1881, M. IMaspero, the successor of M. Mariette
as director of the excavations, opened a pyramid belonging to
a difterent group, which turned out to be the tomb of Ounas,
the last Pharaoh of the fifth dynasty. In this pyramid, portcullis
stones similar to those which have already been figured were
found. When these obstacles were passed " the continuation
of the passage was found, the first part of polished granite,
the second of the close-grained limestone of Tourah. The side
walls are covered with fine hieroglyphs painted green, the roof
sprinkled with stars of the same hue. The passage finally opens
into a chamber half filled with debris, upon the walls of which the
inscription is continued. . . . The mummy-chamber, like that
which precedes it, is covered with hieroglyphs, with the exception
of the wall opposite to the entrance. This wall is of the finest
alabaster, and is effectively decorated with painted ornaments.
The sarcophagus is of black basalt, without inscription. . . . The
text of the inscription which covers the walls is almost identical
with that in the tomb of Papi, but it has the advantage of being complete. M. IMaspero, whom Mariette had previously entrusted
with taking squeezes from the inscription in the tomb of Papi,
recognised certain formulae and phrases which had already struck him in another place. . . . These texts make up a composition
analogous to one which covers the walls of certain little known Theban tombs. Without presenting any very considerable
difficulties, they demand careful examination from those who would
comprehend their meaning.
" M. Maspero, encouraged by this first success, ordered a second
pyramid to be opened. He w-ished to verify, upon the spot, a theory which he had long upheld in spite of the adverse opinions
of the majority of egyptologists. It is well known that between
the sixth and the tenth dynasties a great gap exists, so far as monumental remains are concerned. M. Maspero has always
believed that there is no such gap. He has observed that the
' G. Charmes. in ^he Journal des Dehats, Februan- S, 1881.



236 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
pyramids are, so to speak, grouped chronologically from north to
south ; those of the fourth dynasty at Gizeh, those of the fifth at
Abooseer, those of the twelfth in the Fayoum. The excavations
of Marietta as well as his own showed the tombs of the fifth and
sixth dynasties to have been at Sakkarah. Hence M. Maspero
thinks that the pyramids erected by the sovereigns of the
seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth dynasties are those between Sakkarah and the Fayoum. The future will show whether he
is right or wrong. In any case science will profit by the new
excavations which he is about to undertake." ^ When cross-examined by such questioners as M. Maspero the
pyramids will tell us much. Hitherto they have attracted but little
of that examination which discovers the most curious secrets, but
their size and the beauty of their masonry will ever make the
three great pyramids of Gizeh the most striking objects to the
traveller and to the historian of art. ,
Considering their age, these three pyramids are wonderfully well
preserved. In their presence, even in their actual state of partial
ruin, the oriental hyperbolism of Abd-ul-Latif, an Arab writer of
the thirteenth century, seems no more than natural. " All things fear Time," he cries, " but Time fears the Pyramids! " And yet time has done its work during the last few hundreds of years.
The summits of the great structures have been slightly lowered ;
the gaping breaches in their flanks have been gradually widened ;
and although In spite of their stripped flanks and open wounds
they still rear their heads proudly into the Egyptian sky, all those
accessory structures which surrounded them, and fulfilled their own
well-defined offices in the general monumental ensemble, have
either been destroyed by the violence of man or engulfed by the
encroaching sand. Where, for example, are those wide and
substantial causeways, whose large and carefully adjusted blocks
excited the wonder of Herodotus.^ After having afforded an
unyielding roadway for the transport of so many heavy materials,
they formed truly regal avenues by which the funeral processions
of the Egyptians reached the centre of the necropolis as long as
' Moniteur Egyptien, March 15, 1881. * The causeway which led to the Pyramid of Cheops still exists for some 400 yards of its length ; here and there it rises as much as eighty-six feet above the surface of the plateau. A similar causeway is to be distinguished on the eastern side of the Third Pyramid. At Abou-Roash, at Abousir, and elsewhere, similar remains are to be found.

their civilization lasted. In the plain they were above the level of
the highest inundations, and their gentle slope gave easy access to
the western plateau. The great Sphinx, the image of Harmachis,
or the Rising Sun, was placed at the threshold of the plateau.
Immovable among the dead of the vast cemetery, he personified
the idea of the resurrection, of that eternal life which, like the
morning sun, is ever destined to triumph over darkness and death.

was able to admire his serene smile, his head enframed in a richly carved wig which added to its size and dignity. His body was
never more than roughly blocked out, but a painted decoration, of which traces may still be found, compensated in some degree for
the deficiencies in the modelling.
The soil around each pyramid was carefully levelled and paved
with dressed limestone slabs. Upon this pavement rested the
foundations of the stylobate surrounding the pyramid. Both

banked up than the others, traces of them have been proved to exist. They added somewhat to the imposing effect of those
monuments upon the eye, and gave additional definition to their
bases.^ The area thus paved was inclosed with a wall, which had
an opening towards the east, in front of which the temple, or
funerary chapel of the pyramid, was raised. The latter, no doubt,

3 feet high.



The Tomb under the Ancient Empire. 239
was magnificently decorated. At the foot of the mountains of
stone under which reposed the ashes of the Pharaohs themselves,
smaller pyramids were raised for their wives and children. Of
these some haU' dozen still exist upon the plateau of Gizeh. One
of them has been recognized as the tomb of that daughter of Cheops, about whom Herodotus tells one of those absurd stories
invented by the Egyptians of the decadence, with which his
dragomans took such delight in imposing upon his simple faith.''
Around the space which was thus consecrated to the adoration of
the dead monarch, the long rows of mastabas stretched away for
miles through the vast necropolis. The great ones of Egypt, all those who had been near the
Pharaoh and had received some of his reflected glory, grouped
their tombs as closely as possible about his. Distributed thus by
reigns, the private tombs were erected in close ju.xtaposition one
with another, each being provided with a stele, or sepulchral tablet

upon which the name of the deceased was inscribed, most of them
being adorned with painted bas-reliefs, and a few with statues placed upon their facades. Upon the causeways which connected
Memphis with the necropolis, upon the esplanades erected by the
Pharaohs to the memory and for the adoration of their ancestors,
in the countless streets, lanes, and blind alleys which gave access
to the private tombs, advanced endless processions of mourners,
driving before them the bleating and lowing victims for the funeral
rites. Priests in white linen, friends and relations of the dead
with their hands full of fruit and flowers, flitted hither and thither.
On the days appointed for the commemoration of the dead, all this
must have afforded a curiously animated scene. The city of the
dead had its peculiar life, we might almost say its festivals, like
that of the living. But amid the coming and going, amid all the
bustle of the Egyptian jour des marts, it was the giant forms of
' Herodotus, ii. 126.



240 A History of Art in Anxient Egypt.
the pyramids, with their poUshed slopes ^ and their long shadows
turning with the sun, that gave the scene a peculiar solemnity and a character of its own. Morning and evening this shadow passed
over hundreds of tombs, and thus, in a fashion, symbolized the
royal dignity and the almost superhuman majesty of the kingly
office.
Of all this harmonious conception but a few fragments remain.
The necropolis is almost as empty and deserted as the desert
which it adjoins. The silence is only broken by the cry of the
jackal, by the footsteps of a few casual visitors hurrying along
its deserted avenues, and by the harsh voices of the Bedouins
who have taken possession of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, in their
own fashion, do its honours to the curious visitor. But despoiled
though they be of their ornaments and of their proper surroun
dings, the pyramids are yet among those monuments of the world
which are sure to impress all who possess sensibility or powers
of reflection. In a remarkable passage in the Description gdnerale
de Memphis et dcs Pyramidcs, Jomard has well defined the effect
which they produce upon the traveller and the impressions which
they leave behind : " The general effect produced by the pyramids is very curious. Their summits, when seen from a
distance, look like those of high mountains standing out against
the sky. As we approach them this effect diminishes ; but when
we arrive within a very short distance of their sides a totally
different impression succeeds ; we begin to be amazed, to be
oppressed, almost to be stupefied by their size. When quite
close to them their summits and anHes can no longer be seen.
The wonder which they cause is not like that caused by a great
work of art. It is the sense of their simple grandeur of form
and of the disproportion between the individual power and stature
of man and these colossal creations of his hands. The eye can
hardly embrace them, nor the imagination grasp their mass.
We then begin to form some idea of the prodigious quantity
of dressed stone which goes to make up their height. We see
hundreds of stones each containing two hundred cubic feet and weighing some thirty tons, and thousands of others which
are but little less. We touch them with our hands and endeavour
' Jomard remarks that the upper part of the second pyramid still reflects the rays of the sun. " It still possesses," he says, " a portion of its polished casing, which relects the rays of the sun and declares its identity to people at a vast distance."



The Tomb under the Middle Empire. 241
to realize the power which must have been required to quarry
dress, carry, and fix such a number of colossal blocks, how many men must have been employed on the work, what machines they
used, and how many years it must have taken ; and the less
we are able to understand all these thing-s, the greater is our
admiration for the patience and power which overcame such
obstacles." ^
§ 3. The ToDid under the Mieidle Empire.
We have shown how the mastaba, that is to say, the most
ancient form of tomb in the necropolis of Memphis, was an
expression, both in arrangement and in decoration, of the ideas
of the Egyptians as to a future life. In literature and in art the
works created by a people in its infancy, or at least in its youth,
are the most interesting to the historian, because they are the
results of the sincere and unfettered expansion of vital forces ; this
is especially the case when there is no possibility of a desire
to imitate foreien models. The mastaba deserved therefore to be
very carefully studied. No other race has given birth in its
funerary architecture, to a type so pure, a type which may be
explained in every detail by a master-idea at once original and
well defined. We therefore dwelt upon it at some length and
described it with the care which it demanded. We found it
again in the pyramids, the royal tombs of the Ancient Empire,
which though sensibly modified by the great change in proportion, by the colossal dimensions which the pride of the Pharaohs gave
to one part of their tomb, are yet penetrated by the same spirit.
We have yet to follow the development of the same idea through
the later years of Egyptian civilization, and in localities more or
less removed from that in which she gave her first tokens of power.
In one place we shall find it modified by the nature of the soil to
which the corpse had to be committed, in another by the inevitable
progress of ideas, by the development of art, and by the caprices
of fashion, which was no more stationary in Egypt than elsewhere.
The most important necropolis of the First Theban Empire was that of Abydos in Upper Egypt, upon the left bank of the
' Description de V Egypie, A?iti'juili-s. vol. v. p. 597.
VOL. 1. [ i



242 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
river. The great number of sepultures which took place in
it, from the first years of the monarchy until the end of the
ancient civilization, is to be explained by the peculiarly sacred
character of the city of Abydos, and by the great popularity,
from one end of the Nile valley to the other, of the myths which
centred in it. According to the Egyptian belief, the opening
through which the setting sun sank into the bowels of the earth
for its nightly transit, was situated to the west of Abydos. We
know how the Egyptian intellect had established an analogy
between the career of the sun and that of man ; we may therefore
conclude that in choosing a final resting-place as near as possible
to the spot where the great luminary seemed to make its nightly
plunge, they believed they were making more completely sure of triumphing, like him, over darkness and death.
The sun is not extinguished, he is but hidden for a moment
from the eyes of man. This sun of the infernal regions is Osiris,
who, of all the Egyptian gods, was most universally adored. Although many Egyptian towns could show tombs in which the members of Osiris, which had been dispersed by Set, were re-united by Isis and Nephthys, none of them were so famous, or the object of such deep devotion, as that at Abydos. It was,
if we may be permitted to use such a phrase, the Holy Sepulchre
of Egypt. As, in the early centuries of Christianity, the faithful
laid great stress upon burial in the neighbourhood of some
holy martyr, " The richest and most influential Egyptians," says a well informed Greek writer, " were ambitious of a common
tomb with Osiris." ^
Under such conditions it may readily be understood why
Mariette should have concentrated so much of his attention upon
1 Pseudo-Plutarch, On Isis and Osiris, c. xx. M. Maspero finds, however, no confirmation of this statement in the monuments themselves. " All the tombs which have yet been discovered at Abydos," he says {Revue Critique, January 31, 1881), "are those of Egyptians domiciled at Abydos. But the author from whom this Plutarch derived his inspiration must have known the ancient fiction according to which the soul could only pass into the next world by betaking itself to Abydos, and thence through the opening to the west of that town which gave access to the regions of Ament. Hence the voyage of the dead to Abydos which we find so often represented on tombs ; an imaginary voyage, as the mummy would be reposing safely at Thebes or Memphis (Fig. 159). At all events, the family, after the death of its head, or any Egyptian during his own life, could deposit upon the ladder of Osiris a stele, upon which the tomb actually containing his body could be represented and unmistakably identified with its original by the formula inscribed upon it."

Abydos. In spite of" all his researches he did not succeed in
discoverine;; the tomb of Osiris itself, but vet his dieeino
campaigns afforded results which are most interesting and important from every point of view.^
One district of this necropolis is made up by a vast number of
tombs dating from the time of the ancient empire, and particularly
from the sixth dynasty. Arrangements similar to those of the
mastabas at Sakkarah are found, but on a smaller scale—the
same funerary chambers, the same wells, sometimes vertical,
sometimes horizontal as in the tomb of Ti and the pyramids,
the same materials. The situation of this tomb-district, which
Fig. 159. — The river transport of the Mummy. (ChampolHon, pi.
Mariette calls the central cemetery, has allowed arrangements
to be adopted similar to those on the plateau of Memphis, where
the sand is the only covering to a stratum of living rock in which
it was easy to cut the well and the mummy-chamber.
In the remainder of the space occupied by the tombs the
subsoil is of a very different nature. " The hard and impenetrable

Mariette thought that the sacred tomb was probably in the immediate neighbourhood of the artificial mound called Koum-esSoulian, which may cover its very site. In the article which we quote above, M. Maspero has set forth the considerations which lead him to think that the staircase of Osiris, upon which the consecrated steles were placed, was the flight of steps which led up to the temple of that god. Consequently the tomb of Osiris, at Abydos as at Denderah, would be upon the roof of his temple.

rock is there covered with a sandstone in course of formation ;
this is friable at some points, at others so soft that but few
mummies have been entrusted to it." ^ This formation extends

packed closely together. This Mariette calls the northern
cemetery. " The tombs of Abydos have no subterranean story,
properly speaking. Well, mummy-chamber, and funerary chapel
are all constructed, not dug. In the few instances in which the
eround has been excavated down to the friable sandstone which
over-lies the hard rock, the opening has
been lined with rujjble.
" Hence the peculiar aspect which the
necropolis of Abydos must have pre
sented when intact. Imagine a inulti
tude of small pyramids five or six metres
high, carelessly oriented or not at all, and
uniformly built of crude brick. These pyramids always stand upon a plinth,
they are hollow, and within they are formed into a clumsy cupola by means
of roughly built oft'-sets. The pyramid
stands directly over a chamber in its foundations which shelters
the mumm)\ As soon as the latter was in place, the door of its chamber was closed by masonry."^ An exterior chamber
was often built in front of the pyramid, and being always left

open, served for the performance of the sepulchral rites ; but sometimes this chamber was absent and then those rites were
carried through in the open air, before the stele of the deceased. This latter was sometimes erected upon the plinth, sometimes let
into its face. A little cube of masonry is sometimes found at the

foot of the stele, destined, no doubt, for funeral offerings. Sometimes
the tomb had a surrounding wall of the same height as its plinth ;
this served to mark out the ground which belonged to it, and when
the friends of the deceased met to do him honour, the entrance could be closed, and compara
tive privacy assured even in the
absence of a funerary chapel.
These tombs, which were
generally constructed with no
great care, were for the most
part without casing. The pyra
midal form was given by setting
each course of bricks slightly back from the one below it.
When this part of the work was
finished, each face was covered,
as a rule, with a coat of rough concrete, which, in its turn, was
hidden under a layer of white stucco. This multitude of little monuments, all of the same shape and of much the same size,
must, when complete, have looked like the tents of an encamped army.

As these tombs were all upon the surface of the ground they
have suffered more than any others from the attacks of man. Those which are reproduced among these lines of text were only recovered by Marietta by dint of patient excavation. And

although these ill constructed edifices, so far as their materials
are concerned, are still standing, they will soon follow the many
thousands which once stood in serried ranks round the sepulchre
of Osiris. The only remains of this necropolis which are likely to

be preserved are the numberless steles which Mariette rescued
from its debris. They form about four-hfths of the total number
of those monuments now preserved in the museum at Boulak.^
We figure two of them, one belonging to the Middle, the other
to the New Empire (Figs. 164 and 165).
Whenever religious motives did not affect their choice, the
Egyptians preferred, during the period we are now considering,
to cut their tombs horizontally out of some rocky eminence.
Such a tomb was called a a-Trtoy by the Greeks. The most
interesting examples of these constructions are offered by the
tombs of the twelfth dynasty at Beni- Hassan antl at Siout, both situated between Memphis and Abydos.
Champollion was the first to appreciate the importance of the
grottos of Beni- Hassan. Ever since his time they have received,
for various reasons, much of the attention of egyptologists. We
have already referred to their inscriptions, which are as interesting
to the historian of ideas as to the student of political and social
organizations. We have alluded above to the varied scenes which cover the walls of their chambers, the most important of which have
been reproduced by Champollion, Lepsius, and Prisse d'Avennes ;
we have finally to speak of those famous protodoric columns, as
they are called, in which some have thought they saw the original
model of the oldest and most beautiful of the Grecian orders.
We are at present concerned, however, with the arrangement of
the tombs themselves. These are the same, with but slight
variations, for the smallest and most simple tombs as for those
which are largest anci most elaborately decorated.
These facades are cut into the cliff-like sides of the hills of the
Arab Chain, about half-way up their total height. They are,
therefore, high above the surface of the river. When the cutting
was made, two or three columns were left to form a portico,
the deep shadows of which stand out strongly against the white
ness of the rock. This portico leads to a chamber which is
lighted only from the door. Its ceiling is often cut into the form
of a vault. A deep square niche is cut, sometimes opposite to
the door, sometimes in one of the angles. It once contained
the statue of the deceased. Most of the tombs have but one

only chamber or of that which is farthest from the door, the
opening of a square well is found ; this leads to the mummy
chamber, which is excavated at a lower level.

The chamber upon which the portico opens is the funerary
chapel, the place of reunion for the friends and relations of the
dead. As INIariette very truly remarks, from the first step which
the traveller makes in the tomb of Numhotep at Beni-Hassan,
he perceives that, in spite of all differences of situation, the

up to gymnastics or to games of skill and chance, and among
them the figure of the dead is carried hither and thither in a

mastabas of the Ancient Empire, and here we find them again.

The necropolis of Siout, in the Libyan chain, otters the same
general characteristics. The tomb of Hapi-Tefa, a feudal prince ot the twelfth dynasty, and consequently a contemporary of those
princes of the nome of Meh who are buried at Beni-Hassan, is the most remarkable. It is composed of three large chambers communicating
one with another, and with the e.xternal air by a wide portico. The mummy-pit
is reached from the innermost of these
chambers.
Neither statues, mummies, nor any other movable objects have been found
in these grottos. When their accessible
situation and their conspicuous appear
ance is remembered, this should not cause
surprise. Many centuries ago the acacia doors, which are mentioned in one of the
texts at Beni- Hassan, disappeared, and,
in spite of the accumulation of sand, the mouths of the wells could
be found so easily, and could so readily be cleared, that all objects
of value and interest must have been abstracted from the mummy

chambers in very remote times, perhaps before the fall of the antique
civilization. The inscriptions and the painted walls alone remained
practically intact down to the commencement of the present century. The dryness of the climate, and the difficulty of
detaching them from the wall contributed to their preservation,
which was nowhere more complete than at Beni- Hassan. But
since travelling in Egypt became the fashion their sufferings have
begun. The mania for carving names upon every surface, and for
preserving souvenirs of all places of interest, has destroyed the
whole of one wall. The smoke of torches has also done its work
in reducing the brilliant tones and blunting the delicate contours.
Happily, the more interesting examples are all reproduced in those
great works to which we have already had such frequent occasion
to refer.

The rich necropolis ot Thebes has not preserved any nionu
ments from this period in such good condition as those of Abydos,
Beni- Hassan, or Siout. M. Maspero has discovered, however, in
the district knowni as the Drah-Abonl-Ncgs^ah, some remains of
the royal tombs of the eleventh dynasty. Several of these tombs
resemble in their general arrangements those of the feudal princes
of Meh and .Siout. Thus the sepulchre of the King Ra-Aiioiib
Khopcr-EiiteJ is what the Greeks called a hcmi-spcos, that is, it was
partly built and partly hollowed out of the living rock. Before
the facade thus built against the mountain, two obelisks were
reared. The tombs of the other i)rinces belonging to the family
of Entef were built upon the open plain. They were structures

in masonry, and seem at one time to have been crowned by pyramids. Some idea of their shape may be obtained from our
illustrations of the tombs at Abydos.^
To complete our observations upon the tombs of the first
Theban Empire, it will be sufficient to recall what we have
already said about the pyramids in the Fayoum, which were the
work of the thirteenth dynasty. It is difficult to form an accurate
idea of the appearance of those monuments when complete.
Time has treated them with great severity, and in their present
state it is impossible to verify the assertions of Herodotus as to
the peculiarities of their casing and crowning ornaments. But it
is quite certain that the Middle Empire made no original inventions
in the matter of sepulchral architecture. It appears to have
discontinued some of the ancient arrangements, but in those which
it preserved its efforts were confined to putting old elements
together in a new fashion and with new proportions. It made
frequent use of one mode of sepulture which had previously been
quite exceptional. No mastaba is known which dates from this
epoch, but the kings had not ceased to confide their mummies and
the perpetuation of their glory to pyramids, but these were no longer of such colossal dimensions as under the Ancient Empire,
while their character was complicated, to some extent, by the colossi
with which they are said to have been surmounted, and the figured
decoration of their walls. Finally, they were often employed, not
as self-contained monuments in themselves, but merely as the
culminating points in a more complex ensemble. They were built
upon a rectangular platform or tower with walls slightly inclined from
the perpendicular.
It would seem that the idea of this arrangement had occurred
to the primitive Egyptians. So, too, had that of the speos or rock
cut tomb ; but the Memphite architects have left nothing which
at all resembles the grottos in the mountain sides of Beni-Hassan
and Siout. Neither in the neighbourhood of the pyramids nor in any other district where the tombs of the early epoch are
found, has any sepulchre been discovered which shows the
monumental facades, the large internal development, and the
simple and dignified lines of the artificial chambers in the Arab and Libyan chains.
^ Maspero, Rapport sur tine Mission en Italie (in the Recueii dc Travaiix, \o\. ii. p. 1 66). The Abbott Papyrus gives a list of these little pyramids.



The Tomb under the New Empire. 255
§ 4. The Tomb under the Neic Empire.
The subterranean tombs for which the first Theban Empire
had shown so marlced a preference, became firmly seated in pubhc
favour during the succeeding centuries. We do not know what the funeral customs may have been during those centuries when the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, were masters of Egypt ; but, after
their expulsion, the great Theban dynasties, the eighteenth, the
nineteenth, and the twentieth, by whom the glory of Egyptian
arms and culture was spread so widely, hardly made use of any
sepulchre but the chamber hollowed laboriously in the rocky sides
of that part of the Libyan chain which lies to the west of Thebes.
Every traveller visits the royal tombs which lie in the gloomy
ravine called the Babel-Molouk, or the Gate of the Kings. The
valley is about three miles in length and has a mean width of
about eleven hundred yards ; its sides are riddled with galleries
penetrating more or less deeply into the mountains, and starting
sometimes from the slopes, sometimes from the base of the clifts,
which here and there attain a height of 400 feet. The word
speos seeming to the Greeks to give an inadequate idea of the
depth of these excavations and of their narrow proportions, they
called them avpl'^^es, or pipes ; and modern archDeologists have
often employed the same picturesque term in speaking of the Theban tombs. Five-and-twenty of these tombs are royal ; the
rest belong to wealthy subjects, priests, warriors, and high officers
of state. In extent and richness of ornament some of the latter
are in no way inferior to the tombs of the sovereigns.
Our studies must firs't, however, be directed to the royal
tombs, because in them we find the most original types, the
most important variations upon those which have gone before.
In them the art of the New Empire gives a clearer indication of
all the changes which the progress of ideas had brought about in the
Egyptian conception of a future life. In them, too, the Egyptian
taste for ample dimensions and luxuriant decoration is more
freely indulged. The architects of Seti and Rameses had resources at command far beyond those of which their early
rivals could dispose. They were, therefore, enabled to indulge
their employers' tastes for magnificence, and to give to certain



>56 A History of Art in Ancient Egyi'T.
parts of the tomb a splendour which had been previously
unknown. And such parts were never those upon which the
pyramid builders had lavished most of their attention.
Nothinc^ could be more simple than the course of proceeding
of the earlier architects, whose services and high social position
are indicated for us by more than one stele from the Ancient
Empire. They had to distinguish the royal from the private tomb,
and no means to such an end could be more obvious than to
make use of a form of construction which allowed the height and extent to be added to ad infinitum without compromising
the stability of the monument. Their one idea, therefore, was
to push the apex of the pyramid as far up into the sky as they
could. The height erew as the flanks swelled, so that it became,
by one process of accretion, ever more imposing and better fitted
to safeguard the precious deposit hidden within it. In such
a system the important point was this envelope of the mummychamber, an envelope composed of thousands of the most care
fully dressed and fixed blocks of stone, which, in their turn, were
covered with a cuirass of still harder and more durable materials.
In order that all access to the sarcophagus might be more safely
guarded against, the funerary chapel was separated from the
mountain of hewn stone which inclosed the mummy-chamber.
Supposing the latter to be decorated with all the taste and
richness which we find in the tomb of Ti, it would still be
comparatively small and unimportant beside the colossal mass which overshadowed it, and to which it belonged. The dis
proportion is easily explained. When the pyramids were built,
the workman, the actual mason, had little more to learn. He
was a thorough master of the dressing and fixing of stone and
other materials ; but, on the other hand, the art of architecture
was yet in its infancy. It had no suspicion of those rich and
varied effects which the later Egyptians were to obtain by the
majesty of their orders and the variety of their capitals. It was
not till much later that it learnt to raise the pylon before the
sacred inclosures, to throw solemn colonnades about their courts,
and to greet the visitor to the temples with long naves clothed
in all the o-lorv of colour.
Two periods of national renascence, in the thirteenth and
eighteenth dynasties, had to intervene before these marvels could
be realized. The earlier of these two periods is only known

to us by a few works of sculpture in our museums. We are
forced to Quess at its architecture, as we have nothing but
descriptions, which are at once incomplete and exaggerated, to
guide our imaginations.
The second Theban Empire may be studied under very different
conditions. The architects of that epoch excelled all their
predecessors in the skill with which they used their materials,
and the artistic ability with which they laid their plans. In a
word, they realized the ideal towards which Egyptian builders
had been tending for many centuries, and their genius is still
to be seen in Iniildings which, even in their ruin, charm by the
grandeur of their conception and the finish of their execution.
In the century which saw the construction of the great temples
of Abydos, of Karnak, and of Luxor, the architect who was
charged with the building of the royal tombs could dispose of
all the resources of an empire which stretched from the southern
boundaries of Ethiopia to Damascus and Nineveh. He would
have fulfilled the wishes of neither prince nor people had he not
found means to give an amplitude and a beauty to those tombs
which should stand a comparison with the sumptuous edifices
which the same kings liad erected, in another part of the city,
in honour of the great deities of the country.
The simple and massive forms of the pyramid did not lend
themselves to success in such an enterprise. They afforded no
opportunity for the happy combinations of horizontal and vertical
lines, for the contrasts of light and shadow and splendour of
decoration which distinguished the epoch. The experience of the
Middle Empire proved that it was better to make a fresh departure
than to attempt to foist upon the pyramid a class of ornament
which was destructive to the simplicity in which so much of its
grandeur consisted. The highest expression of the new form of
art was in the temple, the development of which was rather in a
horizontal than in a vertical direction ; in the long avenues of
sphinxes, in the pylons and colossal statues of the kings, in
porticoes and forests of columns. The problem, therefore, was to
embodv some of these elements in the design of the tomb. For
this purpose it was necessary to give increased dimensions and
greater importance to a part of the royal sepulchre which had been
hitherto comparatively neglected. The funerary chapel had to be
expanded into a temple in miniature, into a temple where the



26o A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
king, who had rejoined the deities from whom he was descended,
could receive tlie homage and worship of his people.
The exploits of these princes, which were greater than anything
of which Egypt had to boast in the whole of its glorious past, must have helped to suggest the temple form of their tombs. To
this form the general movement of the national art also pointed,
and to give it effect nothing more was required than the separa
tion of the chapel from the tom.b proper, to which previous
tradition had so closely allied it. The situation of the sepulchre,
after Thebes had become a populous city and the real capital of Egypt, was no longer a matter of question. It was in the rocky
flanks of the Libyan chain that all its inhabitants sought that
asylum for their dead which the inhabitants of Memphis found
upon the eastern edge of the desert. The Libyan chain to the
west of Thebes offers no platform like that of the necropolis of
Memphis. Its cliffs and intersecting ravines offer no sites for
constructed works ; hence the ordinary form of Theban tomb is
the spcos, or the pipe, which is but an exaggerated form of the
speos.
Like the chief men among his subjects, the sovereign loved to
take his last repose in the immediate neighbourhood of the city in
which he had dwelt during his life, in which the streets had so
often resounded to the cries of triumph which greeted his return from some successful campaign, or had seen him pass in some of
those long processions which are figured upon the walls of
Medinet-Abou (Fig. 172).^ His tomb was a cavern like that of
his subjects. Fashion and the physical conditions of the country
governed him as well as his inferiors in rank. From the reign of
Seti I. onwards, the kings chose for their place of sepulture the
wild and deserted valley in which Belzoni found the tomb of that
conqueror. In the time of the Ptolemies it contained the bones
of no less than forty Egyptian monarchs. It would be difficult to
imagine any site better calculated for the isolation and conceal
ment of the mummy than this valley, where the rocks split and
crumble under the sun, and the sand blown hither and thither by
the winds from the desert fills up every crevice in the cliffs.

The Tomb under the New Empire. 26 J
Nothing could be easier than to mask the entrance in such a place,
but, on the other hand, no constructed building of any importance
was possible except at a great expenditure of time and labour.^
But the plain at the foot of the range offered all that the
architect could wish. It was still within the district consecrated
to the dead, and yet its level surface presented no obstacles to an
unlimited extension of any buildings which might be placed upon it. We have here then the facts which determined the course ot the
Egyptian architects.
In the space inclosed between the left bank of the river and the
first slopes of the Lib)an chain, certain edifices were raised which
are still, in great part, extant. Their funerary signification was
never completely understood, in spite of the confused hints to that
effect given by the Greek writers, until within the last few years.
To Mariette belongs the credit of having at last removed all doubt
on the subject. It is probable enough that the number of these
buildings was formerly much greater than it is at present, but
those which have come down to us are still in sufficiently good
preservation to enable us to discern and define their true character,
a character which was doubtless common to all the temples on the
left bank of the Nile.
They were certainly temples. Their general arrangements do
not differ from those of other religious edifices, both in Thebes
itself, and elsewhere in Egypt. There is, however, a difference
which was not perceived until the texts which contained the
history of each temple and of the prince who claimed the credit of
its erection were deciphered. The famous buildings at Lu.xor and
Karnak may be taken as typical examples of the temple, properly speaking, in its richest and most complete development. The
translation of the inscriptions and royal ovals which cover their
walls has sufficed to show that they were national monuments,
public sanctuaries consecrated by the king, as the representative of
the people, to the worship of those great deities who were at once
the principles of life and the faithful protectors of the Egyptian
race. Century after century they never ceased to found such
temples, to increase and to embellish them. From the princes of
the twelfth dynasty down to the Ptolemies, and even to the

264 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Roman emperors, every successive family which occupied the
throne held it a point of honour to add to the creations of its
predecessors. One prince built a hypostyle hall, or a court
surrounded by a colonnade ; another added to the long rows of human or ram-headed sphinxes which lined the approaches ; a
third added a pylon, and a fourth a laboriously chiselled obelisk.
Some kings, who reigned in periods of recuperation after civil Avar
or barbaric invasion, set themselves to repair the damage caused
by time and the violence of man. They strengthened foundations,
they lifted fallen columns, they restored the faded colours of the
painted decorations. The foreign conquerors themselves, whether
Ethiopians, Persians, or Greeks, as soon as they believed them
selves to have a firm hold upon the country, set themselves with
zeal to obliterate the traces of their own violence. Each of these
sovereigns, whether his contribution to any work had been great
or small, took care to inscribe his own name upon it, and thus
to call upon both posterity and his own contemporaries to bear
witness to his piety.
The temple as we see it at Karnak and Lu.xor is the collective
and successive work of many generations. Such, too, was the
character of the great buildings at Memphis which were con
secrated to Ptah and Neith.
But on the left bank of the Nile, and in the neighbourhood of
the Theban necropolis, we find a group of temples whose
physiognomy is peculiar to themselves. Nothing exactly like
them is to be found elsewhere ; ^ and they all belong to one
period, that of the three great Theban dynasties, the eighteenth,
nineteenth, and twentieth.^ " These temples are monuments
raised by the kings themselves to their own glory. They are not,
like the temples at Karnak and Luxor, the accumulated results of
1 Ebebs, indeed, found something of the same kind in the temple of Abydos. He found there a cenotaph consecrated to his own memory by Seti I. This cenotaph was near the tomb of Osiris, while the king himself was buried in the Theban necropolis. {.-Egypferi, pp. 234, 235.) 2 The beautiful little temple of Dayr-el-Medinet, begun by Ptolemy Philopator and finished by his successors, especially by Physco, has often been considered a funerary monument. It is alleged that the situation of the temple in the necropolis, and the nature of the subjects represented in the interior, particularly in the Western Chamber, prove that it was so. If we accept this opinion, we must look upon the temple as a mere freak of fancy, suggested to Ptolemy Philopator by a journey to Thebes. The Greek prince was interred far from it, and it could have formed no part of his tomb.



The Tomu under the New Empire. 265
several generations. Each temple was begun and finished by the
king who planned it, so far at least as construction was concerned.
In those cases where the decoration was left incomplete at the
death of the royal builder, his successor finished it in his name.
In these decorations the founder of the temple was represented
either worshipping the gods, or in the eventful moments of his
military career, or in his great hunts ; and thus, while yet alive, he
laid the foundations of an edifice destined to carry the memory of
his glory and piety down to the latest posterity." ^

Hatasu, the wife and sister of Thothmes II., governed Egypt with
skill and energy for seventeen years, in trust for her brother,
Thothmes III. Where does her mummy repose ? Is it in that
ravine on the south-west of the Bab-el-Molouk which is called
the Valley of the Queens, because the tombs of many Theban
princesses have been found in if ? Or is it in the slopes of the
mountain behind the temple itself? Numerous sepulchral
excavations have been found there, and many mummies have been
drawn from their recesses. The artists to whom the decoration of
the temple was committed, were charged to represent the chief
actions of Hatasu as regent, and, although their works do not give
us a detailed history of her eminently successful administration,
they deal at length with the enterprise of which the regent herself
seems to have been most proud, namely, the maritime expedition
aeainst Ptint, a distant region which must have been either
southern Arabia, the country of the Somalis, or the eastern coast
of Africa. Next in point of age to the building of Queen Hatasu is that
which is called the Ranicsseiim ; this is no other, as the members of
the Institut d'Egypte have clearly proved, than the so-called Tomb
of Osymandicis which is described at such length by Diodorus.^
Erroneous though it be, this latter designation is by no means
without interest, as it proves that, at the time of Diodorus, per
sistent tradition ascribed a funerary origin to the edifice. The
whole temple, inside and out, recalled Rameses II.; the great
conqueror seemed to live and breathe on every stone ; here
majestic and calm, like force in repose, there menacing and
terrible, with his threatening hand raised over the heads of his
conquered enemies. His seated statue, fifty-six feet in height,
was raised in the courtyard ; to-day it lies broken upon the
ground. Battle scenes are to be distinguished upon the remains
of the walls. An episode of the war against the Khetas may be recognized, which seems to have made a great impression upon
the king and his comrades in arms. It deals with that battle
fought upon the bank of the Orontes, in which Rameses, when
surrounded by the enemy, won safety for himself by his own
personal valour and presence of mind. His prowess was cele
brated by Pentaour, a contemporary poet, in an epic canto which
has survived to our day. Rameses is there made to ascribe his
Diodorus, i. §§ 47-49



Tiir: Tomb under the New Empire. 267
safety and all the honour of his victory to his father Amen, who
heard his appeal for help and, precipitating himself into the milc'e,
snatched him from the very hands of his enemies.
Medinet-Abou, which might be called 77ie Second Ramesseum, is
to Rameses III. what the pretended tomb of Osymandias is to
Rameses II. His presence pervades both the temple itself and
its adjoining pavilion. Its bas-reliefs represent one of the greatest
events in Egyptian, we might almost say, in ancient, history
,
namely, the victory won by Rameses over a confederation of the
nations of the north and west, of those who were called the
maritime races. This victory was mainly instrumental in driving
westwards certain peoples who were destined, in more recent
times, to play a great part in the politics of the Mediterranean.
Each of the buildings which we have just noticed had but a
single proprietor. They were each dedicated to the memory of some one individual ; but there was nothing to prevent the
association in a single temple of two sovereigns who might happen
to be united by strong ties of blood, and this course was taken in
the temple of Gournah, situated in the same district of Thebes. It was commenced by Rameses I., the founder of the nineteenth
dynasty, continued by his son, Seti I., and finished by his grand
son, Rameses II. The first Rameses and Seti figure in it with
the attributes of Osiris. The inscriptions enumerate the sources
of revenue set aside by the king, in each nome, for the service of
the annual sacrificial celebrations ; and thus the building reveals
itself as a temple to the perpetual honour of the two first princes
of a race which did so much to add to the greatness and prosperity
of Egypt. The famous colossi of Amenophis III., known to the ancients
as the Statues of RIemnon, no doubt formed part of a similar
building (fig. 18 and pi. vi). The temple built by this prince
near the site of the Ramesseum has almost entirely disappeared,
but the slight traces which still exist cover a vast space, and
suesrest that the buildino- must have been one of rare magni
ficence.^
1 This must h.ive been the structure which Strabo calls the Memnonium. and near to which he seems to place the two colossi (xvii. p. 816). The true name of the author of both temple and colossi might easily be confused with that of the mythical Greek person.ige which the Hellenic imagination persisted in discovering everywhere in Egypt, and the similarity of sound must have helped to perpetuate the mistake among all the foreign travellers who visited the country. A curious passage in



268 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Only one of those Theban temples which rise upon the left
bank of the river is free from all trace of a funerary or commemorative purpose, namely, the temple at Medinet-Abou which bears the ovals of Thothmes II. and Thothmes III. It
shows signs, moreover, of having been frequently enlarged and
added to, some of the additions having been made as recently
as in the time of the Roman Emperors. In this respect it
resembles, in spite ot its comparatively small size, the great
temples upon the right bank of the river. Like them, its creation
was a gradual and impersonal matter. Every century added
its stone, and each successive king engraved his name upon its
walls. How to account for its exceptional situation we do not
know. It is possible that those funerary temples of which we
have spoken were an original invention of the successors of
Thothmes ; perhaps that constructed by Hatasu at Dayr-el
Bahari was the first of the series.
However this may have been, the new t)pe became a success
as soon as it was invented ; all the other temples in the district
may be more or less immediately referred to it. The great
deities of Egypt, and more particularly those of Thebes, are
never forgotten in them. They contain numerous representations
of the princes in whose honour they were erected performing acts of worship before Amen-Ra, the Theban god par exellence, who is often accompanied by Mout and Khons, the other two members of the Theban triad. These temples were therefore
consecrated, like almost all the other sacred buildings of Thebes,
to those local deities which, after the establishment of that city
as the capital of the A\hole country, became the supreme national
gods. Those gods were as much at home in the temples of
Pausanias {Attica, \2) shows us, however, that the Eg)-ptian scholars of his time knew how properly to convey the name of the prince represented in the colossi to foreigners : " I was less struck by that marvel," he says, in speaking of some sonorous stone which was shown to him at !Megara, ' than by a colossal statue which I saw beyond the Nile in Egypt, not far from the pipes. This colossus is a statue of the sun, or of Memnon, according to the common tradition. It is said that Memnon came from Ethiopia into Egypt, and that he penetrated as far as Susa. But the Thebans themselves deny that it is Memnon. They declare that it represents Phamenoph (l>a/Aao<^), who was born in their own country " The story told by Ph£Lostrati'S [Life of Apollonius, 1. vi. p. 232) of the visit of the sorcerer to Memnon, shows that in his time the colossus was surrounded by nothing but ruins, such as broken columns and architraves, fragmentary walls and shattered statues. , Even then the monumental completeness of the " .-Xmenophium '' had vanished.

which we are speaking as in their own pecuHar sanctuaries on
the right bank of the river. In both places they received the
same homage and sacrifices, but in the funerary temples ot the
left bank they found themselves associated, paredral as the
Greeks would say, with the princes to whose memory the temples
were raised. These princes were represented with the attributes
of Osiris, both in the statues which were placed against the piers
in the courtyard and in the bas-reliefs upon the long flat
surfaces of the walls. By these attributes they became more
closely alHed with the great deity who was the common
protector of the dead and the guarantor of their future
resurrection. In this capacity the deceased prince was wor
shipped as a god by his own family. Thus, in the temple
of Gournah, we find Rameses I. seated in a naos and receiving
the homage of his grandson, Rameses II. ; and, again, the latter worshipping Amen-Ra, Khons, and Rameses I. at one and
the same time. This presentation of ofterings to the deified
king, as represented in the chambers of these temples, recalls
the scene which is carved upon almost all the steles, and with
greater variety and more detail, in the bas-reliefs on the internal
walls of the mastabas.
The analogy which we are endeavouring to establish between
the western temples at Thebes and the funerary chambers of
the private tombs, is completed by the biographical nature ot
the pictures which form almost the sole decoration of those
temples. The images presented to our gaze by the chamber walls
of the mastaba are not, indeed, so personal and anecdotical as
those of the temples, but they contain an epitomized representa
tion of the every-day life, of the pleasures and the more serious
occupations of a rich Egyptian. It is easy to understand how,
with the progress of civilization, the more historic incidents in
the life of an individual, and especially when that individual
was a king, came to be figured in preference to those which were
more general in their application. To embellish the tomb of a
conqueror with pictures of his battles and victories was to
surround him after death with the images, at least, of those things
which made his happiness or his honour while alive. Pictures
of some famous feat of arms would give joy to the double ot him
who had performed them, and would help to relieve the ennui of the monotonous life after death. Hence the tendency which

is so marked in the bas-reliefs of the first Theban Empire,
especially in those at Beni-Hassan. The constant and universal
themes which sufficed for the early centuries of the Egyptian
monarchy were not abandoned ; scenes similar to those of the
mastabas, are, indeed, frequently met with in the Theban tombs ;
but it is evident that in many cases scenes were sought out
for reproduction which would have a more particular application ;
there is an evident desire to hand down to future generations
concrete presentments of any political or other events which might appear worthy of remembrance. History and biography
thus came in time to play an important part in sepulchral decora
tion, especially when kings or other royal personages were
concerned. Similar pictures are to be met with here and there in temples
proper, as may be seen by a glance at the bas-relief figured
upon the opposite page (Fig. 174), but in such cases they are
invariably on the outer walls. At Luxor, for instance, the
campaigns of Rameses H. against the peoples of Syria are
thus displayed ; and at Karnak it is upon the external walls of
the hypostyle hall that the victories of Seti I. and Rameses II.
are sculptured. In the interiors of all these courts and halls we
hardly find any subjects treated but those which are purely
religious ; such as female deities assisting at the birth of a
king, or taking him upon their knees and nourishing him from
their breasts, a theme which is also found in royal tombs (Fig. i y^) ;
or one god presenting the king to another (Fig. 33) ; or the king
paying homage to sometimes one, sometimes another, of his
divine protectors (Figs. 14 and 176). We find such religious
motives as these continually repeated, upon wall and column
alike, from the first Theban kings to the epoch of the Ptolemies.
On the right bank of the river pictures of a mystically religious
character are universal ; on the left bank those with an histori
cal aim are more frequent.
It will be seen that the difference between the two kinds of
temple, between that of the necropolis and that of the city, is
not so striking and conspicuous as to be readily perceived by the
first comer who crosses from the one bank of the river to the
odier ; but the variations are quite sufficiently marked to justify
the distinction propounded by Mariette. According to him the
temples in the necropolis are funerary chapels which owe their

increased size and the richness of their decoration to the general magnificence and highly developed taste of the century In which
they were built. But it is enough for our present purpose to have
indicated the places which they occupied in the vast architectural compositions which formed the tombs of a Set! or a Rameses.

They had each a double function to fulfil. They were foundations
made to the perpetual honour of a deceased king, chapels In which his fete-day could be kept and the memory of his achievements
renewed ; but they were at the same time temples in which the national gods were worshipped by himself and his descendants. In
which those gods were perpetually adored for the services which

they had done him while aHve and for those which they might
still do him when dead. In their latter capacity these buildings
have a right to be considered temples, and we shall defer the
consideration of their architectural arrangements, which differ
only in details from those of
the purely religious buildings,
until we come to speak of the
religious architecture of Egypt.
We shall here content our
selves with remarking that the
separation of the tomb and the
funerary chapel by some mile or mile and a half was a novelty
in Egvpt. The different parts
of the royal tomb were closely connected under the Memphite
Empire, and the change in arrangement must have been a
consequence of some modifica
tion in the Egyptian notions as
to a second life. In the mastaba the double had everything within reach of
his hand. Without trouble to
himself he could make use of
all of the matters which had
been provided for the support
of his precarious existence : the
corpse in the mummy pit, the
statues in the serdab, the por
traits in bas-relief upon the
walls of the public chamber. Through the chinks between

of the tomb were mutually helpful. They lent themselves to
that intermittent act of condensation, so to speak, which from
time to time gave renewed substance and consistency to the
phantom upon which the future life of the deceased depended.
This concentration of all the acts and objects, which had for
their aim the preservation of the deceased for a second term
of life, was obviously destroyed as soon as the division of the
tomb into two parts took place. The mummy, hidden away

upon the Theban plain. At such a distance it would neither hear
the prayers nor catch the scent of the ofterings. And the double ?
Is it to be supposed that he oscillated between the colossi in the
temple where the funerary sites were celebrated, and the chamber
in which the corpse reposed ?
Before they could have accepted this divisii^n of the tomb into

;76 A History of Art i\ Ancient Egypt.
That primitive conception was not entirely banished from their
minds ; evidence of its persistency is, indeed, plentiful, but a more
intelligent and less material notion gradually superimposed itself
upon the ancient belief. The indescribable being which was
the representative of the deceased after death became gradually
less material and more spiritual ; in time it escaped from its
enforced sojourn in the tomb and approached more nearly to
that which we call the soul. This soul, like the nocturnal sun,
passed a period of probation and purgation in the under world,
and, thanks to the protection of Osiris and the other deities of the
shades, was at last enabled to return to earth and rejoin the body
which it had formerly inhabited. The problem of death and
a future life was resolved in much the same way by the Greeks
and by all other races who drew much of their inspiration from the
Egyptians. They all looked upon the corpse as still alive when
they expressed their hopes that the earth upon which they poured
out wine and milk would like lie lightly upon it. After a time
they added Tartarus and the Elysian Fields to their beliefs, they
introduced the heroic fathers of their race into the councils of
the gods, and they described and figured the joys which awaited
the just upon the Happy Islands. These various hypotheses are contradictory enough from a
logical point of view ; they exclude and destroy one another.
But when it is a question of notions which are essentially incapable
of being strictly defined, the human intelligence is singularly
content to rest in vague generalities. Contradictions do not
embarrass it ; its adaptability is practically infinite.
The beliefs which we have just described tended for many centuries to become more and more general. They were taught in that Ritual of the Dead which, although certain of its parts date
from the most ancient times, did not take its complete and definite
form until the Theban epoch. Being more spiritual and less
material, they were less opposed to the subdivision of the sepulchre
than the more primitive idea ; and this subdivision was necessary if the public and commemorative part of the tomb were to receive
a splendour and amplitude befitting the exploits of a Thothmes,
a Seti, or a Rameses. Dayr-el-Bahari proves that the change had
already been made under the eighteenth dynasty, but it was not
until the nineteenth that it became definitely adopted. The
progress of ideas and of art had then advanced so far, that more

ambitious desires could be satislied, and the country filled with
magnificent edifices, ^vhich, like the temples of the two Rameses,
were original in so far as they belonged at one and the same time
to religious and funerary architecture. We should call them
cenotaphs, were it not that the Egyptians, like all the other races
of antiquity, believed in the real presence of their dead in the
buildings erected in their honour.

The other division of the tomb is that which contains the well
and the mummy-chamber, the eternal dwelling-place of the
illustrious dead. The second half of tlie royal sepulchre had
to be as sumptuous and lu.xurious in its way as the first, but
the problem placed before the architect was diametrically op|)Osed
to that which he had to solve in the other part of his task. In con
structing and decorating the iunerary temple upon the plain, he
was working before the ejes of the public, for their benefit and
lor that of the remotest posterit)'.



278 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
But the task of hewing out the tomb was a very different one. For long years together he pursued his enterprise in the mystery and shadow of a subterranean workshop, to which all access was no
doubt forbidden to the curious. He and his assistants cut and
carved the living rock by the light of torches, and his best ingenuity
was taxed to devise means for preserving from the sight of all future generations those works of the best artists of Egypt
with which the walls were to be covered. Those prodigies of
patience and skill were executed for the benefit of the deceased
alone. Important though it was that the sepulchre of a great man
should be ornamented to the greatest extent possible, it was of still
greater moment that his last resting-place should not be troubled
by the visits of the living ; and the more completely the mummy
was concealed, the greater were the deserts of the faithful servant upon whom the task had been placed.
In order that this blessing of undisturbed peace in his eternal
dwelling should be secured, the royal tomb seems to have been con
structed without any such external show as would call attention to
its situation. The tombs of private individuals usually had a
walled courtyard in front of them to which access was obtained by
a kind of porch, or tower, with inclined sides and crowned by
a small pyramid. But the explorers, Belzoni, Bruce and others,
who disengaged the entrances to the royal tombs, found them
without propylEea of any kind.^ The doorway, cut vertically in
the rock, is of the utmost simplicity, and we have every reason to
suppose that, after the introduction of the mummy, it was carefully
masked with sand and rocky deh'isr
The existence of the temples in the plain made it unnecessary
that the tombs themselves should be entered after that final
1 111 many cases the sites are wanting for such external constructions. The fine tomb of Seti I., for instance, opens upon a ravine which is filled with the waters of a mountain torrent at certain seasons. 2 When Belzoni's workmen found the entrance to the tomb of Seti, they declared that they could not advance any farther, because the passage was blocked with big stones to such an extent as to be impracticable {Narrative of the Operations and Recent Discoveries within the Pyramids, c^c, in Egypt and Nubia, 1820, 4to). Mariette also believed that as soon as the mummy was in place, the external door was closed and earth heaped against it in such a way as effectually to conceal it. It is thus that the clashing between the tomb of Rameses III. and another is accounted for. The workmen did not see the entrance of the latter, and were, in fact, unaware of its existence until they encountered it in the bowels of the rock. (^Voyage dans la Haiite-Egypte, t. ii. p. 81.)



The Tomb under the New Empire. 279
operation had been performed. Some words of Diodorus are
significant in this direction. "The priests say that their registers
attest the existence of forty-seven royal tombs, but that at the
time of Ptolemy the son of Lagus, only seventeen remained."
This assertion cannot be accepted literally, because twenty-one
tombs have already been discovered in the Bab-el-Molouk, some of
them in a state of semi-completion, besides four in the ravine
which is called the Valley of the JFes/, which makes twenty-five in all. What the priests meant when they spoke to Diodorus was
no doubt, that at the time of the Ptolemies, no more than seventeen
of their entrances had been discovered. If through the plans made
for their construction and preserved in the national archives there
were some who knew their situation, they preserved the secret.
We know, by the inscriptions upon their walls, that fitteen of the
tombs which are now accessible, were open in the time of the
Ptolemies ; several of them seem to have been shown, to the
Roman and other travellers who visited Egypt, as national objects
of interest.

The precautions taken to hide and obstruct the openings of the
royal tombs were thus successful in many cases. Some of these
have only been discovered in our own times, through the ardour
and patience which characterize modern research, and we have
still good reason to suppose that there are others which yet
remain to be found. In 1S72 Professor Ebers discovered a
beautiful private tomb, that of Anemenheb, which, although
situated close to one of the most frequented paths in the
necropolis, had been previously unknown. It was open, but the
opening had been carefully concealed with rough pieces of rock and general rubbish by the fellahs, who used the tomb as a hiding
place from the recruiting officers of the viceroy. They would
remain concealed in it for weeks at a time until the officers had
left their village. The royal cemetery of the Ramessides has
possibly much more to tell us before its secrets are exhausted.
The entrance to the tomb always ran a certain chance of being
discovered and freed from its obstacles. It was difficult, of
course, to prevent the survival of some tradition as to the
' Diodorus, i. 46. - "Above the Memnonium," says Straeo (xvii. 46), "there are royal tombs cut in the living rock to the number of forty ; their workmanship is excellent and well •s'orthy of attention."



28o A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
whereabouts of the burial-places of those great sovereigns whose
memory was a consolation to Egyptian pride in the clays of
national abasement and decay. Provision had to be made, as in
the case of the pyramids, against a forced entry into the gallery
either by an enemy or by some robber in search of treasure, and
we find that the precautions adopted were similar to those which
we have described in noticing the royal tombs at Memphis. Let
us take as an example the finest and most complete of all the tombs of the Ramessides, that of Set! I. After descending two
llights of steps, and traversing two long and richly decorated
corridors, Belzoni arrived, without discovering either sarcophagus
or anything that looked like the site of a sarcophagus, at an
oblong chamber 13 feet 6 inches by 12 feet. A wide and deep
well, which here barred the passage, seemed to indicate that the
extremity of the excavation had been reached. Belzoni caused
himself to be lowered into the well. The walls were everywhere
hard and firm, and without resonance, and there was no sign of a
passage, either open or concealed, by which access to a lateral
chamber, or to a second series of galleries might be obtained.
But Belzoni was too old an explorer to be deceived by such
appearances. On his first arrival at the edge of the well he had
perceived in the wall on the farther side of it a small opening,
about two feet wide, and two feet and a half high. This had been
made, at some unknown period, in a wall covered with stucco and
painted decorations. .Across the well a beam was still lying, which
had served the purpose of some previous visitor to the tomb. A
cord hune from this beam, and it was after discovering that the
well ended in nothing that the screen of masonry on the other
side had been pierced. Belzoni had therefore only to follow the road opened for him by earlier explorers. A plank bridge was
thrown across the well, the opening was enlarged, and a new
series of galleries and chambers was reached, which led at last to
the sarcophagus-chamber itself.^ Belzoni remarked that throughout the whole course of the excavation the doors of the chambers showed evidence of having
been walled up, and that upon the first steps of one of the stair
cases a heap of stone rubbish had been collected, as if to discourage any one who might penetrate beyond the well and pierce the barrier beyond its gaping mouth. It seems likely that the

The Tomb under the New Empire. 281
first violator of the tomb knew the secret of all these arrange
ments, and consequently that its first opening took place in
very ancient times, and was the work of some native Egyptian
robber.
In the sarcophagus-chamber Belzoni discovered a contrivance
of the same kind as that which had failed to stop him almost upon
the threshold of the tomb. The sarcophagus of oriental alabaster
was in place, but empty; the lid had been raised and broken.
^
From the sound given out by the floor when struck the explorer
perceived that there must be a hollow space under the base of the
sarcophagus. He cut a hole and brought to light the first steps of
a staircase, which led to an inclined plane by which the interior of
the mountain was deeply penetrated. A wall had been raised at
the foot of these steps, beyond which a settlement of the super
incumbent rock put an end to all advance after a distance of fifty
one yards had been traversed. Is it not possible that Belzoni
only discovered a false sarcophagus, placed to deceiv^e unbidden
visitors like himself, and that the mummy was deposited, and still
lies, in a chamber at the end of this corridor ? The point at which
the fallen rock arrested his progress is tour hundred and eighty-three
feet from the external opening, and about one hundred and eighty
below the level of the valley. At such a depth, in these narrow
and heated galleries, where there is no ventilation and where the
smoke of the torches rapidly becomes stifling, it is not astonishing
that, in spite of his admirable perseverance, Belzoni held his hand
before completing the e.xploration.
These subterranean tombs are hardly less astonishing than the
colossal masses of the pyramids for the sustained effort which they
imply ; if we take the trouble to reflect upon the peculiarly difficult
conditions under which they were constructed, they may even
impress our imaginations more profoundly than the artificial mountains of Cheops and Chephren. We have already men
tioned a figure which gives some idea of the surprising length of
their passages ; and although no one of the other tombs quite
equals that of Seti, many approach it in dimensions. The tomb
of Rameses III. is 416 feet long, that of Siptah 370 feet, and
' This beautiful sarcophagus is now in the Soane Museum.

Ed. ^ Behoni beheved that this passage led again into the open air ; that it was, in fact, another entrance to the tomb. " I have," he says, "reasons to think so ; " but he does not give his reasons. \OL. r. O

others varied between 200 and 270 feet. For the construction of such places an enormous number of cubic yards of rocky debris
had to be cut from the interior of the mountain, and carried up by
narrow and steep corridors to be " shot " in the open air. Still
more surprising is the elegance and completeness of the decora
tion. In the tombs of Seti and of Rameses III. there is not a
single surface, whether of walls, piers, or ceilings, which is not
covered with the work of the chisel and the brush, with orna
mental designs, with the figures of gods and genii, of men and

laid flat upon the carefully-prepared surfaces of white stucco. In
these sealed-up caverns, in which the air is constantly warm and
dry, the pictures have preserved their freshness of tint in the most
startling fashion. And to obtain all this harmonious effect no
light but an artificial one was available. It was by the smoky
glare of torches, or by the flickering flame of little tarra-cotta
lamps, suspended from the roof by metal threads, that the patient
artists of Egypt drew these masterly contours, and elaborated the
exquisite harmony of their colour compositions. Egyptian art

never reached greater perfection than in these characteristic
productions of its genius, and yet no human eye was to enjoy
them after that day upon which the final touch was to be given to

end. Like those which we have found in the tombs of the
Ancient Empire, they had a sort of magic virtue, a sovereign power to save and redeem. The personages and articles of food represented on the mastabas were shadows of people and shadows
of material sustenance, destined for the service and the food of
a shadow, the double of the defunct proprietor of the tomb.
The all-powerful influence of prayer and faith, working through
Osiris, turned these shadows into realities.
Fig. 182. —Entrance to the tomb of Rameses III. (From Horeau, pi. 21.)
Representations of this kind are common enough in the royal
tombs of Thebes. It will suffice if we notice those which are
still to be seen in the sepulchre of Rameses III., in the series
of small chambers in the first two passages. Like the hunting
scene which we take from the walls of a private tomb (Fig. 183),
these pictures have, beyond a doubt, the same meaning and
value as those in the mastaba. But in the Theban tombs their
significance is only secondary. Ideas had progressed to some
purpose since the days of the Memphite kings. Both in its
general arrangement and in the details of its ornamentation,



Tllli ToMli UNDER Till'; N K\V E.Ml'IRE. 285
the sepulchres in the Bab-el-Molouk gave expression to the new, more philosophical, and more moral conception which had come
to overlie the primitive beliefs.
The first conception was that of the double, inhabiting the
tomb, and kept alive in it by sacrifice and prayer. But in time
the Egyptians would appear to have realized that the double
was not the only thing that remained after the death of a human
unit. Their powers of apprehension were quickened, in all
probability, by that high moral instinct of which the oldest
pages of their literature give evidence. Good or bad, every
man had a double, the continuance and prosperity of which
depended in no way upon his merits or demerits. Unless the
just and the unjust were to come to one and the same end,
somethino- more was wantino-. This something was the soul
[ba). Instead of vegetating in the interior of the tomb, this
soul had to perform a long and difilcult subterranean journey

in imitation of the sun and almost upon his footsteps — during
which it had to undergo certain tests and penances. From this
jjeriod of trial it would emerge with more or less honour,
according to its conduct during the (ew short years passed by it on earth and in company with the body to which it had
belonged. It had to appear before the tribunal of Osiris-Khent
Ament, the Sun of Night, around whose seat the forty-two
members of the infernal jury were assembled.^
1 This belief in the appearance of the dead before Osiris and his assessors gave rise to one of the most curious errors made by tlie Greeks in speaking of Egypt. The scene in cpiestion is figured upon many of the tombs visited by the Greek travellers, and in many of the illustrated papyri which were unrolled for their gratification. In the fragments of some funerary inscription or of some of these manuscripts, hastily translated for them by the accompanying priests, they found frequent allusions to this act of trial and judgment. They were greatly struck by the importance attached by the Egyptians to the sentence of this tribunal, but, always in a hurry, and sometimes not esjjecially intelligent, they do not seem to have always understood what the dragoman, without whom they could not stir from the frontier, told them as to this matter. They believed that the judges in question were living men, and their tribunal an earthly one, and that they were charged to decide whether sepulture should be granted to the dead or not. One of the early tra\'ellers, we do not know which, gave currency to this belief, and we know how it has served as the foundation for much fine writing, from the time of Diodorus to that of Bossuet. A\'e can find nothing either in the figured monuments or in the written texts which hints at the existence of such a custom. Ever since the key to the hieroglyphics was found, egyptologists have been agreed upon this point. Every Egyptian was placed in a sepulchre befitting his station anil fortune; his



}86 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
There, before the " Lords of truth and justice," the soul had
to plead its cause, and there it had to repeat, with an amount of assurance and success which would depend upon its conduct in
the light, that negative confession which we read in chapter
cxxv. of the " Book of the Dead" which contains an epitome
of Egyptian morality.^ But those incorruptible judges were not
guided solely by the testimony of the ba in its own favour.
They weighed its actions in a pair of scales and gave judgment
according to their weight.- The impious soul was flogged, was
delivered to storm and tempest, and, after centuries of suffering,
underwent a second death, the death of annihilation. The just
soul, on the other hand, had to conquer in many a combat before

it was admitted to contemplate the supreme verities. During

obstacles, and, as the sun reappears each morning upon the
eastern horizon, it arrived surely at last at those celestial dwellings

the greatest possible precision those mysterious regions where the
soul had to undergo its appointed tests. Such beliefs afforded a
wide scope for the individual influence of the artist and the poet,

which is unique in Egyptian art. But the Egyptians were
accustomed, from such early times, to give a concrete form to all
their ideas, that they were sure to clothe the plastic expression
of this theme in a richness and brilliancy of colour which we do
not find to the same degree in any other people of antiquity. On
the other hand, although they did not escape the operation of the
eternal law of change, their temperament was sufficiently con
servative to give to each of their creations a peculiar fi.xity and
consistency. Their Hades, if we may call it so, took on a very
definite form, and features which varied but little throutrh a

long course of centuries ; and this form is practically that which
we find in the sepulchres of the great Theban kings and in
some belonging to private individuals.
It was through long and gloomy galleries, like those of the
aipiy^, that the perilous voyage of the soul had to be undertaken.
A boat carried it over the subterranean river, for in a country
which had the Nile for its principal highway, every journey,
even that of the sun through space, was looked upon as a
navigation. Spacious saloons were imagined to exist among
those galleries, chambers where the infernal gods and their
acolytes sat enthroned in all the majesty of their office ; and so the passages of the tomb were expanded
here and there into oblong or square chambers, their roofs supported by pillars
left in the living rock. On either side
of the audience chambers the imagina
tion placed narrow passes and defiles,
in which the walls seemed to close in
upon the soul and bar its progress ;
tortuous corridors and gloomy gulfs
were fixed in these defiles, in which
the terrible ministers of divine ven
geance held themselves in ambush,
prepared to harass the march of souls
not yet absolved, and to overwhelm
with frightful tortures those against
whom sentence had already been pro
nounced. The tomb, therefore, had its
snares and narrow passages, its gaping depths and the mazes
of its intersecting and twisting corridors. To complete the
resemblance nothing more was required than to paint and chisel
upon the walls the figures of those gods, genii, and monsters who
peopled the regions below. On one side the pious king may be
seen, escorted by Amen-Ra and the other divinities whom he had
worshipped during life, advancing to plead his cause before Osiris ;
on the other, the punishment of the wicked helps to give (fc/a/ to
the royal apotheosis by the contrasts which it affords. Thus the tombs of the Theban period embody the Egyptian
solution of the problem which has always exercised mankind.
Their subterranean corridors were a reproduction upon a small

pavilion ; from a bas-relief. {Description de V Hgvpte, i., pi. 74-)



The Tomb under the New Empire. 289
scale of the leading characteristics of the under world, and
we should commit a great mistake were we to look upon the
series of jsictures which decorate its walls as mere ornament
resulting from a desire for luxury and display. Between the ideal
models of these pictures and the pictures themselves the
Egyptians established one of those mutual confusions which have
always been readily accepted by the faithful. Nothing seemed
more natural to the Egyptian, or to the Ethiopian who was his
pupil, than to ascribe the power of speech and movement to the
images of the gods, even when they had painted or carved them with their own hands. This M. Maspero has shown by an
ingenious collation of various texts.^ The chisel which created such tangible deities gave them something more than the
appearance of life. Each god exercised his own proper function
in that tomb which was a reproduction in small of the regions of
the other world. His gestures and the written formulse which
appeared beside him on the walls, each had their protective or
liberating power. To represent the king in his act of self
justification before Osiris was in some measure to anticipate
that justification. The reality and the image were so intimately
commingled in the mind of the believer that he was unable
to separate one from the other.
Did the royal tombs contain statues of the defunct ? None
have been found in any of those already opened, and yet there is
a chamber in the tomb of Rameses IV. which appears from its
inscriptions to have been called the Statue c/iamber, while another
apartment in its neighbourhood is reserved for the funerary
statuettes. The tombs of private individuals contained statues ;
why then should none have been put in those of the sovereigns ?
The commemorative sanctuary, the external funerary temple, was
adorned with his image often repeated, which in order that it
might be in better keeping with the magnificence of its
surroundings, and should have a better chance of duration, was
colossal in its proportions. In the inclosures of the temples of the two Rameses and upon the site of the Amenophium, the remains of these huge figures are to be counted by dozens, most
of them are of rose granite Irom Svene ; the smallest are from
24 to 28 feet high, and some, with their pedestals, are as much as
from 55 to more than 60 feet. The two colossi of Amenophis III.,

the Pharaoh whom the Greeks called Memnon, reached the
latter height. Flayed, mutilated, dishonoured as they have
been, these gigantic statues are still in place. They should
be seen in autumn and from a little distance as they raise
their solitary and imposing masses above the inundated plain,
when their size and the simplicity of their lines will have an
effect upon the traveller which he will never forget (Fig. 20,
and Plate vi.). In the royal tombs at Thebes, as in those at Memphis, the
approach to the mummy-chamber is not by a well, but by an inclined plane. The only wells which have been discovered in the tombs of the Bab-el-Molouk are, if we may use the term,
false wells, ingeniously contrived to throw any would-be violator off the right scent. We have already mentioned one of these
false wells as existing in the tomb of Seti. In the pyramids
the corridor which leads to the mummy-chamber is sometimes an ascending plane, but in the Theban tomb it is always descending.
At the end of the long descent the mummy- chamber is reached
with its sarcophagus, generally a very simple one of red granite,
which has hitherto, in every instance, been found empty. It is doubtful whether the sarcophagus-chamber was closed by a door or not. It is known that tombs were sometimes thus
closed ; some of the doors have been found in place,' and in a
few of the texts mention is made of doors,"^ but not the slightest
vestige of one has yet been discovered in the royal sepulchres at Thebes. " All the doorways have sills and grooved jambs, as
if they had been closed, but no trace of hinges or of the leaves
of a door itself have been found." ^ It is possible that they
were never, put in place. The exact and accurate spirit which
marks all the work of Egyptian artists would lead them to
prepare for the placing of a door at the entrance to each chamber ;
but at the same time it is obvious that a iew panels of sycamore
would do little to stop the progress of any one who should attempt
to violate the royal sepulchre. This latter consideration may

ancient state. 2 See one of the great inscriptions at Beni- Hassan, interpreted by M. Maspero

have caused them to abstain from expending time and trouble
upon a futile precaution.
These tombs seem to have varied greatly in size from
reasons similar to those which determined the dimensions of the
pyramids, namely, the length of reign enjoyed by their respective makers. Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus continually added
to the height and mass of their tombs until death put an end to
the work. In the same way, Seti and Rameses never ceased
while they lived to prolong the quarried galleries in the Bab
el- Molouk. As these galleries were meant to be sealed from the
sight of man, this prolongation was caused, no doubt, by the desire
to develop to the utmost possible extent those pictures which
were to be so powerful for good over the fortunes of the defunct
in the under world.
Apart trom the question of duration, reigns which were glorious
would give us larger and more beautiful tombs than those which were obscure and marked by weakness in the sovereign. The
three great Theban dynasties included several of those monarchs who have been called the Louis the Fourteenths and the
Napoleons of Egypt, ^ and it was but natural that they should
employ the crowd of artificers and artists which their enterprises
gathered about them, for the excavation and decoration of their
own tombs. Either for this reason or for some other, there
is an extraordlnarv difterence between king and king in the
matter of their tombs. Even when we admit that a certain
number of royal sepulchres have so far escaped discovery, it is
difficult to find place for all the sovereigns of the nineteenth and
twentieth dynasties in the two Valleys of the Kings. Many
things lead us to believe that several of those princes were
content with very simple tombs ; some of them may have been
merely buried in the sand. Thus Mariette discovered, at
Drah-Aboit l-A"eggah, the mummy of Queen Aah-hotep, of the
nineteenth dynasty, some few feet beneath the surf^ice. The
mummy chamber consisted of a few ill-adjusted stone slabs. Like
other mummies found on the same place, it seemed never to have
been disturbed since it had been placed beneath the soil. It was
gilt all over, and was decorated with jewels which now form some
of the most priceless treasures of the Boulak Museum.
The private tombs in the Theban necropolis, which are much

more numerous than those of kings, do not, like the latter, belong
to a single period in the national history. The most ancient
among them date back to the eleventh dynasty. There are
some also of the Sait period, and a few contemporary with the
Ptolemies and the Roman emperors. But by far the greater number belong to that epoch which saw Thebes promoted to be
the capital of the whole country, to the centuries, namely, between Amosis, the conqueror of the Hyksos, and the last of the Ramessides.
These tombs are distinguised by great variety, but, before
noticing the jDrincipal types to which they may be referred, the
points which distinguish them from the royal burying-places
should be indicated. The private sepulchre is never subdivided
hmmimmm^i . ^ /W "^ ^ // ^
Fig. 1S6. —Plan and section of a royal tomb. (Dcscriplion de V Egypte, vol. ii., pi. 79.)
like those of the kings. This subdivision is to be explained by
the exceptional position of the sovereign mid-way between his
subjects and the national deities. A funerary chapel cut in the
sides of the mountain would obviously be too small for the
purposes to which the commemorative part of the tomb of a
Rameses or a Seti would be put. On the other hand, no private
individual could hope to receive royal honours nor to associate
his memory with the worship of the great Egyptian gods. We
find that for him the chapel always remains closely connected
with the mummy chamber. Sometimes it is in front of it,
sometimes above it, but in neither case does it ever fail to form
an integral part of the tomb, so that the latter preserves at once
its traditional divisions and its indissoluble unitv.



The Tomb under the New Empire. 293
We. may say the same of the well, which plays the same part in the private tombs of the New Empire as in the ]Mastaba and the S/>cos of the Ancient and Middle Empires. In almost
every instance the mummy chamber is reached by a well,
whether the tomb be constructed in the plain or in the side
of the mountains. It is seldom so deep as those of Gizeh
or .Sakkarah ; its depth hardly e.xceeds from 20 to 30 feet ;
but its arrangement is similar to those in the early necropolis. The mummy chamber opens directly upon it. Sometimes
there are two chambers facing each other at the foot of the well,
and of unequal heights.^ After the introduction of the corpse,
which was facilitated by notches cut in two faces of the well,
the door of the mummy chamber was built up — the well filled
in. In a few exceptional instances, the tombs of private individuals seem to have had no well, and the innermost
chamber, as in the case of roj-al tombs, received the mummy.In such cases it is very necessary to make sure that explorers
have not been deceived by appearances. In these dusty interiors
the carefully sealed opening might easily escape any but the
most careful research ; and as for a sarcophagus, when one is
found in such a chamber, it may have been placed there long
after the making of the tomb. Such usurpations are by no means
unknown.^ In the time of the Ptolemies, influential people, such
as priests and military functionaries, made them without scruple. The venerable mummies, dating from the time of Rameses, were thrown into a corner ; their cases were made use of, sometimes
for the mummy of the usurper, sometimes for more ignoble
purposes. In more than one of these usurpations the new
comer has been placed in a chamber constructed for some
other object.
' Passalacqu.v describes a tomb of this kind in detail in his Cafa/c's^/te raisonnict historique des Antiquith dccoicvcrtcs en Egypte (8vo. 1826). Tliis tomb had been visited and pillaged at some unknown epoch. One of the two chambers had been opened and stripped, but the second, which opened lower down the well, and on the other side, escaped the notice of the violators (pp. 1 18-120). In the tomb opened by Rhind {Thebes, its Tombs, etc. pi. 5, v.), the well gave access to four chambers of different sizes arranged round it like the arms of a cross.
" Desci-iption de VEgypfe, {Antiquith^ plates, vol. ii. p. 78. ^ Rhind describes one of the most curious of these substitutions in his chapter IV. In that case an usurper of the time of Ptolemy established himself and all his family in the mummy chambers at the foot of the well, after relegating the statues and mummies of the rightful owner and his people to the room above.

The well and mummy chamber in the rock are, then,
found almost universally, but the form of the rest of the tomb
varies according to its date and site. Those in the plain are
arranged differently to those in the hill sides. But it must be
understood that when we speak of the plain in connection with
the Theban tombs, we do not mean the space over which spread
the waters of the TJile. We mean the gentle sandy slopes
which lie between the foot of the cliffs and the cultivated fields,
a narrow band which widens a little between the long spurs which
the mountains throw out towards the river. In these land-gulfs
the rock crops up here and there, and nowhere is it covered by
more than a thin layer of sand. .Such a soil, being above the
reach of the annual inundation, was marvellously well-fitted both
-TrrmwrmnnTrr

for the construction of the tomb and for the preservation of
the mummy.
In this, which may be called the level part of the necropolis,
the tombs have left but slight and ill-defined traces. Their
superstructures have almost entirely disappeared, and yet some
which have now completely vanished were seen by travellers
to Thebes in the first half of the present century. By comparing
what they tell us with the figured representations in bas-relief
and manuscript, we may form some idea of the aspect which this part of the cemetery must formerly have presented. The
tombs which it contained were built upon the same principles as those of Abydos ; a square or rectangular structure with
slightly sloping walls was surmounted by a small pyramid. There

was, however, an essential difference between the two. At
Abydos the nature of the subsoil compelled the architect to
contrive the mummy chamber in the interior of his own structure ;
at Thebes, on the other hand, there was nothing to prevent him
from being faithful to a tradition which had manifest advantages,
and to intrust the corpse to the keeping of the earth, at a depth
below the surface which would ensure it greater safety both
from violence and from natural causes of decay. At Thebes the
rock was soft enough to be cut with sufficient ease, and yet firm
enough to be free from all danger of settlement or disintegra
tion. The soil of all this region is
honeycombed with mummy pits, which have long ago been pillaged and are
now filled up with sand. The super
structure was built above the well and
inclosed the funerary chapel. Sometimes it was surmounted by a small pyramid ; sometimes it was a quad
rangular mass standing upon a surbase,
with a pilaster at each angle and a
boldly projecting cornice at the top. The oldest of the known tombs of Apis may
be taken as specimens of this latter class,
which must also have been represented at Thebes. These are contemporary
with the eighteenth dynasty, and were discovered by M. Mariette at Sakkarah.^ These little monuments have either
been destroyed since 185 1 or covered
by the sand (see Fig. 190).
The other type is that of the Spcos. We have here seen that
it dates from the Ancient Empire, but came into general employment and obtained its full development under the First and Second Theban Empires. We have already given some idea of the
architectural character and of the decoration of the royal sepulchres,
we must now indicate the peculiarities which in these respects
distinguish the tombs of the kings from those of their subjects.
One of the points of difference has already been noticed ; the

employment of vertical wells instead of inclined planes as approaches to the mummy chamber. The most extensive of
all the Theban catacombs is that of a private individual, the priest
Petamounoph (Fig. 191).^ In this the galleries have not less than
895 feet of total length, besides which there are a large number of
chambers, the whole being covered with painted reliefs. But this
tomb is quite exceptional. The great majority, those of Rekhmara,
for instance, and others excavated in the hill of Sheikh-Abd-elGournah, are composed of two or three chambers at most, united by corridors. The mummy pit opens sometimes upon the corridor between two of the chambers, sometimes upon the innermost
chamber, sometimes upon a corrider opening out of the latter.
Rhind tells us that he followed one of these corridors for about

300 feet beyond the chamber without arriving at the mummy
pit, the air then became too bad for further progress.^
The chamber for the funerary celebration is easily recognized
by its decorations. It is sometimes the first, but more often the
second in order, in which case the first acts as a sort of vestibule. A considerable number of tombs are very simple in arrangement.
The door o-ives access to a rectangular chamber, from 6 to 10 feet
hio-h and 10 to 12 wide, which extends, in a direction parallel to
the wall, for from 12 to 24 feet. This chamber is the funerary
chapel. From its posterior wall a passage opens which is nearly
' This view is obtained by a series of horizontal and vertical sections in the
rock to the right of the galleries. By this operation we are enabled to show the
subterranean parts of the tomb.

equal in height and width to the chamber. It has a gentle slope
and penetrates into the rock to a distance of some 25 to 35 feet,
terminating, in some cases, in the mummy chamber itself but
more frequently in a small apartment containing the opening of
a mummy pit.^
It must not be imagined that all the tombs were decorated ;
there are many which have received neither painted nor carved
ornament, and in others the ornament has never been carried
beyond the first sketch. But even in those which are quite bare,
the Vv'alls are, in nearly every instance, covered with a coat of
white stucco.
As the funerary chapel was contained in the tomb itself, no
effort could be made to mask or conceal the entrance, which
accordingly was taken advantage of for the display of ornament.

But no attempt was made to cut architectural facades in the cliffs
like tho.se at Beni-Hassan ; not more than one or two sepulchres
have yet been discovered which have facades made up of those
columns which have been called protodoric. The makers of
these tombs were usually content with dressing the surface of
the rock above and around the entrance. The latter, with its
sloping lintel above a cornice, stands in the centre oi an almost
perpendicular wall which acts as its frame or background. In
the uninjured state of the sepulchre this wall was more or less
concealed bv a construction similar to those which we have
described in speaking of the tombs in the plain. According to
all appearances, one of these little buildings, a cube of masonry
crowned by a pyramidion, was placed before the doorway of

every tomb. It is difficult to say whether it was of sufficient size
to contain a funerary chamber or not. It may have been no more
than a solid erection of small size, meant only to mask the
entrance and to indicate its situation to those concerned. The
wealthy, indeed, may have been only too pleased to thus call
public attention to the position- of their gorgeously decorated
selpulchres. The little pyramids of crude brick which we find upon the
irregular rocky slopes of the Koiwuet-el-Moiirrayi, above the little window-shaped openings with which the rock is honeycombed,
probably answered a similar purpose. Of these some are still
standing, and others have left unmistakable traces upon the
slope. They seem to have existed in great numbers in this part
of the necropolis, which seems to have been set apart, about the
time of the eighteenth dynasty, for the priests.
Although they hardly varied from the two or three types
consecrated by custom, these little buildings could easily have
been made to present slight differences one from another. When
they existed in their entirety, they must have given a very
different aspect to the cemetery from that which it presents with
its rocky slopes burnt by the sun into one harsh and monotonous
tint, varied only by the black and gaping mouths of the countless
tombs. The sides which they turned to the city and the river
were adorned with those brilliant colours of which the Egyptian
architects were so fond, and, spaced irregularly but never very
far apart, they were sprinkled over the ground from the edge
of the plain to the topmost ridges of the hills. Nearly all of
them ended in a pyramid, but the varying dimensions of their
bases and their different levels above the plain, gave diversity to
the prospect, while here and there the slender apex of an obelisk
rose above the private tombs and signalized the sleeping-place
of a king. It has been very justly remarked, that the best idea
of an Egyptian cemetery in its best time is to be gained by a
visit to one of those Italian Campo-Santos, that of Naples, for
example, where the tombs of many generations lie closely
together under a blazing sun.^ There, too, many sepulchral
facades rise one above another upon the abrupt slope of a hill
into which the graves are sunk. A comparison with the cemetery
of Pere-Lachaise, or with that at Constantinople, would not be

The Tomb under the New E>hure.
just because no trees could flourish in the Theban rocks, at
least in the higher part of the necropolis. In those districts which
border closely upon the irrigation channels, the tombs seem to
have had their gardens and fountains. Palms and sycamores appear to have been planted about them, and here and there,
perhaps, the care of survivors succeeded in rearing flowers
which would shed their perfumes for the consolation of the dead.^
Were there statues in the courtyards by which many of these tombs were surrounded ? There is no doubt that such statues
were placed in the rock-cut sepulchres ; all the museums of
Europe have specimens which come from the Theban tombs. The latter were opened and despoiled, however, at such an
early period that very few of these figures have been found in
place by those who have visited the ruins of Egypt for legitimate
motives. We have, however, the evidence of e.xplorers who
have penetrated into tombs which were practically intact. They
tell us that the statue of the deceased, accompanied often by that
of his wife and children, was placed against the further wall of
the innermost chamber.- In some tombs, a niche is cut in the
wall for this purpose,^ in others a dais is raised three or four
steps above the floor of the chamber.^ Here, too, is found the sarcophagus, in basalt when the defunct was able to afford such a
luxury, and the canopic vases, which were sometimes of stone,
especially alabaster, sometimes of terra cotta, and now and then
of wood, and were used to hold the viscera of the deceased.
These vases were four in number, protected respectively by the
goddesses Isis, Nephtys, Neith, and Selk (Fig. 196).
During the period of which we have just been treating, the taste
for these huge rock-cut tombs was not confined to Thebes and
' Maspero, Recueil de Travaiix, vol. ii. p. 105. The formula which is generally found upon the funerary steles of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties hints at this : "That I may walk daily upon the border of my fountain; that my soul may rest upon the branches of the funerary garden which has been made for me, that each day I may be out under my sycamore ! " These desires may be taken literally, as is proved by two steles in the museums of Turin and Boulak, which bear representations of tombs upon their lower portions. The latter, which we reproduce, comes from the Theban necropolis. ^ Most of these statues were of calcareous stone, but in the Description de r Egypte {Antiguites, vol. iii. p. 34) two granite ones are mentioned. ^ In the tomb of .Amenemheb, for instance, discovered by Professor Ebers.

successive Apis died and required a sepulchre. This gallery and
its chambers served for 700 years (see Figs. 197 and 198).
The funerary architecture of the Sait epoch seems to have had

campaign which, begun in the month of October, 1850, brought fame to a young man who had, until then, both open enmity and secret intrigue to contend against. ' Herodotus, ii. 169. "The Egyptians strangled Apries, but, having done so, they buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers. This tomb is in the temple of Athene {Ncifh). very near the sanctuary, on the left hand as one enters. The natives of .Sais buried all the kings which belonged to their nome within this temple, and, in fact, it also contains the tomb of Amasis, as well as that of Apries and his family, but the former is not so close to the sanctuary as the former, but still it is within the buildings of the temple, in a large chamber constructed of stone, with columns in the shape of the trunks of palm trees, and richly decorated besides, which incloses



The Tomb under the New Empire. 307
Preceding centuries afford no example of a tomb placed within
a temple like this.^
First of all the royal mummy was entombed in the bowels of an
artificial mountain, secondly, under the Theban dynasties, in those
of a real one ; but at Sais, it rests above the soil, in the precincts
of a temple, where curious visitors come and go at their will, and
nothing but a pair of wooden doors protects it from disturbance. Such an arrangement seems inconsistent with all that we know of
the passionate desire of the Egyptians to give an eternal duration
to their mummies. We have every reason to believe that this
desire had shown no diminution at the time of the twenty-sixth
dynasty, and we can hardly admit that Psemethek and his
successors were less impelled by it than the meanest of their
subjects.
The e.xplanation of the apparent anomaly is to be found, we
believe, in the peculiar nature of the soil of Lower Egypt. The
Sait princes were determined to leave their mummies in the city
which they had filled with magnificent buildings and had turned
into the capital of all Egypt. Both s/>i'os and mummy pit, how
ever, were out of the question. Sais was built in the Delta ; upon
an alluvial soil which was wetted through and through, as each
autumn came round, by the water of the Nile. Neither hill nor
rock existed for many miles in every direction. It was, therefore,
a kind of niche or shrine with folding doors, in which the mummy is placed." This is one of the most dififttult passages in Herodotus, and has given much trouble to translators and commentators. See Larcher's note (ii. 565), and the passage in Stobseus (serm. .xli. p. 251), which he cites in justification for the sense which is here given to the word dvptlifiara. Strabo is content with but a line on this subject :
'' Sais," he says, " especially worships Athene (Neith). The tomb of Psammitichos is in the very temple of that goddess" (xvii. 18). ' Herodotl's affirms (ii. 129-132) that Mycerinus caused the body of his daughter to be inclosed in the flank of a wooden cow, richly gilt, and he says that " the cow in question was never placed in the earth." In his time it was exposed to the view of all comers in a magnificently decorated saloon of the royal p.alace of Sais. We may be allowed to suggest that Herodotus was mistaken in the name of the prince ; Mycerinus is not likely to have so far abandoned all the funerary traditions of his time, or to have entombed the body of his daughter in a spot so distant from his own pyramid at Gizeh. There is one hypothesis, however, which may save us from the necessity of once again accusing the Greek historian of misunderstanding what was said to him ; in their desire to weld together the present with the past, and to collect into their capital such national monuments as might appeal to the imaginations of their subjects, the Sait princes may have transported such a curiously shaped sarcophagus either from the pyramid of Mycerinus or from some small pyramid in its neighbourhood.



3o8 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
absolutely necessary that the tomb should be a constructed one
upon the surface of this soil. It would seem that the pyramid
would have been the best form of tomb to ensure the continued
existence of the mummy, but, to say nothing of the difficulty of
finding a satisfactory foundation for such a structure upon a soft
and yielding soil, the pyramid had, for many ages, been completely
out of fashion. Egyptian art was entirely occupied with richer
and more varied forms, forms which admitted of the play of light
and shade, and of all the splendour of carved and painted decora
tion. The pyramid being rejected, no type remained but that of
Fig. 198. — Sepulchral chamber of an Apis bull ; from Mariette.
a building which should inclose both mummy chamber and
funerary chapel under one roof, or, at least, within one bounding
wall. There was also, it is true, the Abydos type of sepulchre,
with its mummy chamber hidden in the thickness of its base
;
but it was too heavy and too plain, it was too nearly related to the
pyramid, and it did not lend itself readily to those brilliant
compositions which distinguish the last renascence of Egyptian
art. But the hypostyle hall, the fairest creation of the national
genius, was thoroughly fitted to be the medium of such picturesque
conceptions as were then required, and it was adopted as the



The Tomb under the New Empire. 309
nucleus of the tombs at Sais. A hall divided, perhaps, into three
aisles by tall shafts covered with figures and inscriptions, afforded
a meeting-place and a place of worship for the living. The
mummy chamber was replaced by a niche, placed, doubtless,
in the wall which faced the entrance, and the well, the one
essential constituent of an early Egyptian tomb, was suppressed.
Such arrangements as these afforded much less security to the mummy than those of Memphis or Thebes, and to compensate
in some measure for their manifest disadvantages, the tomb was
placed within the precincts of the most venerable temple in the
city, and the security of the corpse was made to depend upon the
awe inspired by the sanctuary of Neith. As the event proved,
this was but a slight protection against the fury of a victorious
enemy. Less than a year after the death of Amasis, Cambyses
tore his body from its resting-place, and burnt it to ashes after
outraging it in a childish fashion.^
The tombs of these Salt kings, consisting of so many com
paratively small buildings in one sacred inclosure, remind us
of what are called, in the modern East, furbchs, those sepulchres of Mohammedan saints or priests which are found in the immediate
neighbourhood of the mosques. Vast differences exist, of course, between the Saracenic and Byzantine styles and that of Ancient
Egypt, but yet the principle is the same. At Sais, as in modern
Cairo or Constantinople, iron or wooden gratings must have
barred the entrance to the persons while they admitted the glances
of visitors ; rich stuffs were hung before the niche, as the finest
shawls from India and Persia veil the coffins which lie beneath the
domes of the modern burial-places. Perhaps, too, sycamores and
palm-trees cast their shadows over the external walls.- The most
hasty visitor to the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn can hardly
fail to remember the suburb of Eyoub, where the /itrbe/is of the
Ottoman princes stand half hidden among the cypresses and
plane trees.
The material condition which compelled the Salt princes to
break with the customs of their ancestors, affected the tombs of
' Herodotus, iii. 16. Upon this subject see an interesting article by M. Eugene Revh.lout, entitled : Le Hoi Amasis et la merceiiaires Gtecs, selon les Donnes d' Heiodote et les Renseigiiements de la Chronique Dbiiotique de Faiis. {Rei'ue Egyptologique, first year; p- 50 et seq.) ^ There are two passages in Herodotus (ii. 91, and 138) from which we may infer that the Egyptians were fond of planting trees about their temples.

private individuals also. Throughout the existence of the
Egyptian monarchy the inhabitants of the Delta were obliged
to set about the preservation of their dead in a different fashion
to that followed by their neighbours in Upper Egypt ; their
mummies had to be kept out of reach of the inundation. Isolated
monuments, like those of Abydos, would soon have filled all the
available space upon artificial mounds, such as those upon which
the cities of the Delta were built. The problem to be solved
was, however, a simple one. Since there could be no question of
a lateral development, like that ot the Theban tombs, or of a down
ward one, like that of the Memphite mummy pits, it was obvious
that the development must be upwards. A beginning was made
by constructing, at some distance from a town, a platform of crude
brick, upon which, after its surface had been raised above the
level of the highest floods, the mummies were placed in small
chambers closely packed one against another. As soon as the
whole platform was occupied, another layer of chambers was commenced above it. Champollion discovered the remains of
tvvo such cemeteries in the immediate neighbourhood of Sais.
The larger of the two v/as not less than 1,400 feet long, 500 feet
wide, and So feet high ; an enormous mass " which resembled," he
said, " a huge rock torn by lightning or earthquake." ^ No doubt
was possible as to the character of the mass ; Champollion found
among the debris both canopic vases and funerary statuettes.
Within a few years of his death Mariette undertook some fresh
excavations in the same neighbourhood ; they led to no very
important results, but they confirmed the justice of the views
enunciated by Champollion. Most of the objects recovered were
in a very bad state of preservation ; the materials had been too soft, and in time the dampness, which had impregnated the base of the whole structure, had crept upwards through the porous
brick, and turned the whole mass into a gigantic sponge.
These tombs resemble those of the kings in having no well
;
and as for the funerary chapel we do not as yet know whether it
existed at all, how it was arranged, or what took its place. Perhaps each of the more carefully constructed tombs was
divided into two parts, a chamber more or less decorated and a
niche contrived in the masonry, like the rock-cut ovens of the
Phoenician catacombs. As soon as the munmiy was introduced,
' Lettres Eciites d' Ei^xpte et de Ntd>ic, 2nd edition, 1868, p. 41.



The Tomb under the New Empire. 311
the niche was walled up, while the chamber would remain open
for the funerary celebrations. In order that the tombs situated
at some height above the level of the soil, and in the middle of
the block of buildings, should be reached, a complicated system
of staircases and inclined planes was necessary. In the course
of centuries the tombs of the first layer and especially those in the
centre of the mass, were overwhelmed and buried from sight and access by the continual aggregation above and around them.
The families to which they belonged, perhaps, became e.xtinct,
and no one was left to watch over their preservation. Had it
not been for the infiltration of the Nile water, these lower strata
of tombs would no doubt have furnished many interesting objects
to explorers. In any case it would seem likely that, if deep
trenches were driven through the heart of these vast agglomera
tions of unbaked brick, many valuable discoveries would be made.^
Such a system left slight scope to individual caprice ; space must
have been carefully parcelled out to each claimant, and the
architect had much less elbow room than when he was cutting
into the sides of a mountain or building upon the dry soil
of the desert. In the royal tombs alone, if time had left any
for our inspection, could we have found materials for judging
of the funerary architecture of Sais, but, as the matter stands,
we are obliged to be content with what we can gather from
Theban and Memphite remains as to the prevailing taste of
the epoch.
Upon the plateau of Gizeh, to the south of the Great Pyramid,
Colonel Vyse discovered and cleared, in 1837, an important tomb to which he gave the name of Colonel Campbell, then
British Consul-General in Egypt. The external part of the
tomb had entirely disappeared, but we may conclude that it was
in keeping with the subterranean portion. The maker of the
tomb had taken the trouble to define its extent by a trench cut
around it in the rock. The external measurements of this trench
are 89 feet by 74. A passage had been contrived from one of its
faces to the well, which had been covered in all probability by an
external structure. The well opens upon a point nearer to the north
than the south, and its dimensions are quite exceptional. It is 54
feet 4 inclies deep, and 31 feet by 26 feet 8 inches in horizontal

of great interest and value to assyriologists.

section ; it terminates in a chamber which is covered by a vault
II feet 2 inches thick. It was not however in this chamber, but
in small lateral grottos that
several sarcophagi in granite,
basalt, white quartz, &c., were
found. The remains of two
other wells were traced. This tomb dates from the time of Psemethek I.
In the necropolis of Thebes
there is a whole district, that of
the hill El Assassif, where most of the tombs belong to the
twenty-sixth dynasty. Their
external aspect is very different
from that of the Theban sepulchres. The entrance to the
subterranean galleries is preceded by a spacious rectangular

wide ; it was surrounded by a stone or brick wall, and reached by a flight of steps. A pylon-shaped doorway gave access to the
courtyard from the side next the rock, another door of similar
shape opened upon the plain ; but some tombs are entirely closed
(see Fig. 201) except towards the mountain, from which side they
may be entered by one or two openings.
The subterranean part of these tombs varies in size. In some
of them a gallery of medium length leads to a single chamber.
In others, and these form the majority, there is a suite of rooms
connected by a continuous gallery. To this latter group belongs

the largest of all the subterranean Theban tombs, that of Peta
mounoph (Fig. 191). We have already noticed the extraordinary
dimensions of its galleries ; there are also two wells which lead to
lower sets of chambers. All the walls of this tomb are covered
with sculptured reliefs. In the first chambers these are in very
bad condition, but they improve as we advance, and in the
farthest rooms are remarkable for their finish and good preserva
tion. The exterior of tliis sepulchre is worthy of the interior.
The open court, which acts as vestibule, is 100 feet long by
80 wide. An entrance, looking towards the plain, rises between
two massive walls of crude Ijrick, and, to all appearance, was
once crowned by an arcade ; within it a flight of steps leads

down into the court. Another door, pierced through the lime
stone rock, leads to a second and smaller court which is surrounded
by a portico. From this peristyle a sculptured portal leads to
the first subterranean chamber, which is 53 feet by 23, and
once had its roof supported by a double range of columns. The
next chamber is 7,7, feet square. With a double vestibule
and these two great saloons there was no lack of space for
Catherines of the friends and relations of the deceased.
Neither at Memphis nor at Thebes do the tombs of this late
period contain any novel elements, but they are distinguished
by their size and the luxury of their decoration. In some, the
wells are much wider than usual ; in others It is upon the external
courts and upon those double gateways which play a part similar
to that of the successive pylons before a Theban temple, that
extra care is bestowed. Vaults are frequently employed and
help to give variety of effect. Private tombs become as large
as those of sovereigns, and similar tendencies are to be found
in the sculpture. The Egyptian genius was becoming exhausted, and it endeavoured to compensate for its want of invention and
creative imagination by an increase in richness and elegance.
A chronological classification is only possible in the cases of
those tombs which bear inscriptions and figures upon their walls. At Memphis, as at Thebes, the remains of thousands of tombs
are to be found which give no indication of their date. Some
times they are deep mummy pits, slightly expanding at the
bottom ; sometimes, as at Thebes, the rock is honeycombed with graves between the border of the cultivated land and the foot of the Libyan chain. In the mountains themselves there are
hundreds of small chambers, with bare walls and often extremely
minute in size, cut in the sides of the cliffs. Finally, there are
the vast catacombs, in each chamiber of which the mummies of
labourers and artisans were crowded, often with the instruments
of their trade by their sides. ^ Pits full of mummified animals are also found among the human graves. Rhind saw some hundreds of the mummies of hawks and ibises taken from a tomb at the foot of the Drah-Abou'1-Neggah. They were each enveloped in bandages of mummy cloth, and beside theni
numerous small boxes, each with a carefully embalmed mouse

The Tomb under the New Empire. 315
inside it, were found. The lids of these boxes had each a wooden
mouse upon it, sometimes gilt.^
We have endeavoured to notice all that is of importance in the
funerary architecture of Egypt, because the Egyptian civilization,
as we know it through the still existing monuments, carries us much farther back than any other towards the first awakening
of individual thought and consciousness in mankind. The
primitive conceptions, of those early periods were, of course,
different enough from those to which mankind was l^rought by
later reflection, but nevertheless they were the premises, they
contained the germ of all the development that has followed ; and
to thoroughly understand the origin and constitution of this
development it was necessary to follow it up to its source, to the
clearness and transparency of its springs.
The art of Egypt is the oldest of all the national arts, and the
oldest monuments of Egypt are its tombs. By these alone is
that earliest epoch in its history which we call the Ancient Empire known to us.
In later ages the country was covered with magnificent temples
and sumptuous palaces, but, even then, the tomb did not lose its
pre-eminent importance. The chief care of the Egyptian in all
ages was his place of rest after death. Rich or poor, as soon as
he arrived at full age he directed all his spare resources towards
the construction and decoration of his tomb, his happy, his
eternal " dwelling," with which his thoughts were far more pre
occupied than Avith that home in the light, upon which, whether
it were a miserable mud hut or a vast edifice of brick or wood,
he looked with comparative indifference, regarding it as an encamp
ment for a day or a mere hotel for a passing traveller. The tombs,
when not hollowed from the living rock, were built with such
solidity and care that they have survived in thousands, while the
palaces of great sovereigns have perished and left no trace, and
the temples which have been preserved are very few in number.
Being mostly subterranean and hidden from the eye of man,
sepulchres preserved the deposits entrusted to them much better
than buildings upon the surface. Those among the latter which

were not completely destroyed, were, in very remote times,
damaged, pillaged, stripped, and mutilated in a thousand ways.
All that subsists of their decoration —shattered colossi and bas
reliefs often broken and disfigured — tells us nothing beyond the pomps and triumphs of official history. The tombs have suffered
much less severely. The statues, bas-reliefs, and paintings which have been found in them, seem, in many instances, to have been the work of the very men whose footprints were found in the
sand which covered their floors when they were opened.^ The
pictures offered to our eyes by the walls of the private tombs are
very different from those which we find in the temples. All
classes of the people appear in them in their every-day occupa
tions and customary attitudes. The whole national life is
displayed before us in a long series of scenes which comment
upon and explain each other. Almost all that we know concerning
the industrial arts of Egypt has been derived from a study of
her tomb-houses. In every hundred of such objects which our
museums contain at least ninety-nine come from those safe
depositories.
In order to give a true idea of the national character of the
Egyptians and to enable the originality of their civilization to
be thoroughly understood, it was necessary to show the place
occupied in their thoughts by the anticipation of death ; it was
necessary to explain what the tomb meant to them, to what
sentiments and beliefs its general arrangements and its principal
details responded ; it was necessary to follow out the various
modifications which were brought about by the development of
religious conceptions, from the time of the first six dynasties to that of the Theban Empire.
The brilliant architectural revival which distinsfuished the first
and second Theban Empires was mainly due to this develop
ment of religious thought. Almost all the peculiarities of the
Memphite tomb are to be explained by the hypotheses with which
primitive man is content. But when mature reflection evolved
1 When Marietta discovered the tomb of the Apis which had died in the twentysixth year of the reign of Rameses II., the fingers of the Egyptian mason who laid the last stone of the wall built across the entrance to the tomb were found marked upon the cement, and " when I entered the sarcophagus-chamber I found upon the thin layer of dust which covered the floor the marks made by the naked feet of the workmen who had placed the god in his last resting place 3,200 years before." (Quoted by Rhonk in L' Egypte a F<:tiks /ouriias, p. 239.)

higher types for the national gods, when polytheism came to be
superimposed upon fetishism, the hour arrived for the temple
to take its proper place in the national life, for majestic colonnades
and massive pylons to be erected on the banks of the life-giving
river. The temple was later than the tomb, but it followed
closely upon its footsteps, and the two were, in a fashion, united
by those erections on the left bank of the Nile, under the Theban
necropolis, which partook of the character of both. The temple
is the highest outcome of the native genius during those centuries
which saw Egypt supreme over all the races of the East, supreme
partly by force of arms, but mainly by the superiority of her
civilization.



CHAPTER IV.
THE SACRED ARCHITECTURE OF EGYPT.
^ I. — The Temple under the Aiicicnt Eii2pire.
No statue of a god is known which can be confidently referred
to the first six dynasties. Hence it has sometimes been asserted
that at that early period the Egyptian gods were not born, if we
may use the expression, that the notions of the people had not
yet been condensed into any definite conception upon the point.
Some writers incline to believe that Egyptian thought had not
yet reached the point where the polytheistic idea springs up, that
they were still content with those fetishes which retained no
slight hold upon their imaginations until a much later period.
Others affirm that the absence of gods is due to the fact that
the Egyptian people were so near to the first creation of mankind
that they had not yet forgotten those religious truths which were
revealed to the fathers of our race. They believe that Egypt
began with monotheism, and that its polytheistic system was
due to the gradual degradation of pure doctrine which took place
among all but the chosen people.
We shall not attempt to discuss the latter hypothesis in these
pages. It is a matter of faith and not of scientific demonstration.
But to the first hypothesis we shall oppose certain undoubted
facts which prove it to be, at least, an exaggeration, and that
Egypt was even in those early days much farther advanced,
more capable of analysis and reflection, than is generally imagined. M. Maspero, in his desire for enlightenment upon this point,
searched the epitaphs of the ancient empire, and found in their
nomenclature most of the sacred names which, in later phases
of the national civilization, designate the principal deities of the



The Temple under the Ancient Empire. 319
Ei^ryptian pantheon.^ The composite proper names often seem
to express individual devotion to some particular deity, and
to indicate some connection between the latter and the mortal
who bore his name and lived under his protection. These divinities must, then, have already been in existence in the
minds of the Egyptians. The most that can be said is that
they had not yet arrived at complete definition ; art, perhaps,
had not yet given them those unchanging external features and
characteristics which they retained to the last days of paganism.
It is quite possible that they were, more often than not, represented by those animals which, in more enlightened times, served them
for symbols.
li. the inscription and the figured representations still existing
upon a certain stele which was found a short distance eastward
of the pyramid of Cheops^ are to be taken literally, we must
believe that that monarch restored the principal statues of the Egyptian gods and made them pretty much what we see them in monuments belonging to times much more recent than his.
The upper part ot the stele in question shows the god of
generation, Horus, Thoth, Isis in several different forms, Nephthys,
Selk, Horus as the avenger of his father, Harpocrates, Ptah,
Setekh, Osiris, and Apis. These statues would seem to have
been in gold, silver, bronze and wood. Mariette, however, is
inclined to think that this stele does not date from the time
of Cheops, that it is a restoration made during the middle, or,
perhaps, even during the New Empire. On attempting to
restore so venerable a lelic of the author of the greatest

architectural work in their country, the scribes may have allowed
themselves to add figures treated in the style of their own day
to the ancient text. It is equally doubtful, moreover, whether
the text itself dates back to the earlier period, and we need,
perhaps, accept as fact only this : that Cheops restored an already
existing temple, assigned to it certain sacred offerings as
revenues, and restored the statues of gold, silver, bronze, and
wood, which adorned the sanctuary.
It may be that the divine effigies were abundant even in those
early days, but that they have failed to survive to our day. The
portraits of so many private individuals have been preserved
because, in their desire to aftbrd a proper support to their double,
they multiplied their own images to as great an extent as their
means would allow. Between the third and the sixth dynasties
the multiplication of these portrait statues went on at a prodigious
rate, and their number may be judged from the fact that twenty were taken from the scrdab alone of the tomb of Ti. The greater their number, the greater was the chance that one of them would
escape destruction.
The ingenuity of man combined with the process of nature
to preserve these figures to generations in the remote future,
to a time when they could excite interest enough to save them
from, destruction and to ensure them a chance of eternal existence.
To the thick walls of the mastabas, to the well-concealed serdabs,
and, more than all, to the constantly increasing mask of sand laid upon the cemeteries of Gizeh and Sakkarah by the winds
from the desert, did they owe their preservation through the
troublous times which were in store for Egypt.
In their more exposed situations in the temples and private
houses, the images of the gods ran far greater risks than the
private statues. The material of those which were of gold, silver,
or bronze, would excite dangerous cupidity, while the wooden ones
were pretty sure, sooner or later, to be destroyed or damaged by fire. The stone statues might be overthrown and broken and
replaced by others of a later fashion, besides which a vast number
of them have perished in the lime-kilns. We see, then, that supposing Cheops and Chephren to have
paid their devotions before statues of Isis and Osiris, Ptah
and Hathor, there is nothing very astonishing in the total
disappearance of those figures. To argue frorii their absence

that in those early days the gods of the Egyptians were not yet
created, and consequently that there were no temples erected in
their honour, is to hazard a gratuitous assertion which may at any
time be disproved by some happy discovery, such as that which
gave us, twenty years ago, the statue of Chephren now in the
Boulak Museum. Before that statue was found it might similarly
have been contended that the series of royal effigies only commenced with the first Theban Empire.

opinion of all contemporary archaeologists, dates from the time of

combining the body of a crouching lion with the head of a man,

corresponding to the Harmachis, or rising sun, of the Greeks.
According to the stele above quoted, it was carved, long before
the time of Cheops, out ot a natural rock which reared its head
above the sand in this part of the necropolis ; here and there the
desired form was made out bj' additions in masonry.^ As primitive Egypt had gods she must have had temples.
Few traces of them are to be found, however, and their almost
total disappearance is mainly owing to causes which merit
careful notice.
Before they began to erect stone buildings, the early Egyptians
1 The total height of the Sphinx is 66 feet; the ear is 6 feet 4 inches high; the nose is 6 feet, the mouth 7 feet 9 inches, wide. The greatest width of the face across the cheeks is 14 feet 2 inches. If cleared entirely of sand the Sphinx would thus be higher than a five-storied house. For the history of the Sphinx, the difterent restorations which it has undergone, and the aspect which it has presented at difterent epochs, see Mariette, Ques/toiis relatives aiix noircelks Fouilles. Our plan (Fig. 204) shows the wide flight of steps which was constructed in the time of Trajan to give access to a landing constructed immediately in front of the fore-paws. Between these j)aws a little temple was contrived, where the steles consecrated by several of the Theban kings in honour of the Sphinx were arranged. Caviglia was the first to bring all these matters to light, in 1S17, but the ensemble, as it now exists, only dates back to the Roman epoch. It is curious that neither Herodotus, nor Diodorus, nor Strabo, mention the Sphinx. Pliny speaks of it (N. H. xxxvi. 1 7) ; some of the information ^^hich he obtained was valuable and authentic, but it was mixed with errors ; it was said to be, he tells us, the tomb of the king Armais, but he knows that the whole figure was painted red. The Denkmaler of Lepsius (vol. i. pi. 30) gives three sections and a plan of the little temple between the paws. The same work (vol. V. pi. 68) contains a reproduction of the great stele of Thothmes relative to the restoration of the Sphinx.

made constant use of wood for many ages. Various bas-reliefs
and paintings prov^e that this latter material was never entirely
abandoned, but after stone and brick came into general use it
was reserved for special purposes; it was usually employed in
those lighter and more ephemeral edifices in which rapidity of
construction was the chief point required. When, in the remains
of the early dynasties, we see the characteristics of wooden
constructions so closely imitated in stone, we are constrained to
believe that wood then played a much more important part than
under the Theban princes. Either brick or stone was absolutely
necessary for a tomb, because they alone had sufficient durability,
but it is quite possible that most of the temples were of wood.
With the help of colour and metal, wood could be easily made
to fulfil all the conditions of a temple. The shrine which enclosed
either a statue or some symbolic object, the portico which
surrounded the inner court, the furniture, the doors, the high
palisade which enclosed the sacred precinct, might all have been
of wood. When destroyed by accident or damaged by time, such
a structure could be quickly and easily restored.
We may admit, however, that from the epoch of the Pyramids onwards, such cities as Thinis, Abydos, Memphis, and others,
constructed their temples of stone, which, in the then state of
architectural skill, they could have done without any serious
difficulty. The chief cause of the disappearance of the early temples
was the construction of those that came after them. The national
taste changed with the centuries, and the time came when the
comparative simplicity of the primitive erections was unable to
satisfy the longing of the people for magnificence and splendour.
New temples, more vaSt and sumptuous than the old, were
constructed, and the substance of their predecessors was, as a
matter of course, employed in their construction. Sometimes a
fragmentary inscription or a piece of sculpture betrays the
restoration ; and, here and there, inscriptions on the later building
go so far as to preserve the name of the architect of the first. An
instance of this occurs at Denderah. Champollion discovered that the Ptolemaic temples almost always replaced structures
dating from the great Theban or Sait dynasties. The island of
Phite, however, affords an exception to this rule.^ These temples

he calls " second editions." But in some cases they were third
or even fourth editions.
But in spite of all these rearrangements and restorations, a few
sacred buildings of the early period were still in existence during
the Roman occupation of the countr)-, and were then shown as
curiosities. This we may gather from a passage in Strabo.
After having described, \\ith much precision, the disposition of
certain buildings which are easily recognized as temples built
under the princes of the New Empire, he adds : " At Heliopolis,
however, there is a certain buildinof with several ranees of
columns, which recalls, by its arrangement, the barbarous style ;
because, apart from the great size of the columns, their number
and their position in several long rows, there is nothing graceful
in the building, nothing that shows any power of artistic design ;
eftort, and impotent eftort, is its most striking characteristic." ^
Lucian, too, was thinking of the same building in his treatise upon
the Syrian goddess, when he said that the Egyptians had, in
ancient times, temples without sculptured decorations.
One of these ' barbarous ' temples, as Strabo calls them, is
supposed to have been discovered in the small building disinterred
by Mariette in 1S53, at about 50 yards distance from the right
foot ot the Sphinx in a south-easterly direction. Mariette cleared
the whole of the interior, and by means of a flight of steps well
protected from the sand, he provided easy access to it. But he left
the external walls buried as he found them, and so they still
remain.
The entrance is by a passage about 66 feet long and 7 wide, which runs almost in an easterly direction through the massive
masonry which constitutes the external wall. About midway
along this passage two small galleries branch off; that on the
right leads to a small chamber, that on the left to a staircase
giving access to the terrace above. At the end of the passage we
find ourselves at one of the angles of a hall, running north and
south, and about 83 feet long by 23 wide. The roof is sup
ported by six quadrangular piers. These are monoliths 16
time of Thotnmes III. The same thing occurred at Edl'ou and at Esneh. We except Philse, because there is good reason to beUeve that in the time of the Ancient Empire that island did not exist, and that the cataract was then at SilsiUs.

Several of their architraves are still in place. These are stones
about 10 feet in length.^ From the eastern side of this hall
another opens at right angles. This second hall is about 57 feet
long and 30 wide, and its roof was supported by ten columns
similar to those we have already mentioned.
From the south-west angle of the first hall there is a short
corridor which leads to six deep niches in the masonry, arranged
in pairs one above the other, and apparently intended for the
reception of mummies.

In the middle of the eastern wall of this same large chamber
there is a short and wide passage which leads to a third and last
hall, parallel to the one with six columns ; it has no supporting
pillars, but there is, in the centre of the floor, a deep well which
Mariette cleared from the sand with which it was filled. There

had been water in it, because it was sunl-: below the level of the Nile. At the bottom nine broken statues of Chcphren were
found ; they were not copies, one from the other, but represented
the king at different periods of his life. Several stone
cynocephali were also found. At each end of this hall there is a small chamber communicating
with it by short corridors. One of these, that in the northern
angle of the temple, seems to have communicated with the
outward air by an irregular opening in the masonry.
Fig. 203. — Interior of the Temple of the Sphinx (from a sl<ctch by M. Ernest DesjardinsK'
The materials employed in the interior of this building are
rose granite and alabaster. The supporting piers are of granite,
the lining slabs of the walls and the ceiling, alabaster. Both
these materials are dressed and fixed with care and knowledge,
but in no part of the temple is the slightest hint at a moulding
or at any other sort of ornament to be found. The pillars are
plain rectangular monoliths ; the walls are without either bas
reliefs or paintings, and there is not a trace of any inscription on
any part of the building. The external walls are constructed
of the largest limestone blocks which are to be found in Egypt.



326 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
In these days none of their outward faces are visible, but
according to Mariette, who, doubtless, had inspected them by means of temporary excavation, nothing is to be seen but
" smoothlv polished surfaces, decorated w-ith long vertical and
horizontal grooves skilfully interlaced ; in one corner there is a
door, the only one, and that very small." ^
For the last thirty years there has been much controversy as
to the true character of this curious monument. Mariette himself
allows us to see that he could not convince himself of its real
meaning: "It cannot be doubted that this building- dates from the time of the pyramids ; but is it a temple or a tomb ? Its ex
ternal appearance is, it must be confessed, more that of a tomb than
of a temple. From a distance it must have looked not unlike a mastaba from Sakkarah or Abousir, which it but slightly excelled
in size. The six deep niches which exist in the interior recall the internal arrangements of the pyramid of Mycerinus and the
Mastabat-el-Faraoun, and the general plan resembles that of
several other tombs in the neighbourhood. It appears, therefore,
that the hypothesis which would make it a sepulchre might be
upheld without violating the rules which should guide the
archaeologist. . . .On the other hand it ma)', very naturally,
be asserted that, as the Sphinx is a god, it must be the Temple
of the Sphinx."
This latter hypothesis seems to have found most favour with
Mariette. The rectangular niches, which at first seemed to him
to be intended for funerary purposes, were accounted for in
another way. " May they not be here," he asks, " what the
crypt is at the temple of Denderah ? " And he does not hesitate
to emplo)' the terms Temple of the Sphinx, and Teniplc of
Harniacliis. He does not give his reasons, but to some extent
we can supply them. Every mastaba of any importance has
funerarv representations upon it, and inscriptions containing both
the name of the deceased and those magical formulae which we have
already e.xplained ; the walls display his portrait and the whole course of his posthumous life. The humblest of these tombs
shows at least a stele upon which the name of the defunct is inscrib
ed together with the prayer which is to insure him the benefit of

The Temple under the Ancient Empire.
the funerary offerings mentioned upon it. The tomb is thus
consecrated to the use of some particular person, of an individual
whose name is placed upon it, and who is exclusive owner ot it
and its contents to all eternity. In this temple there is no sign
of such individual appropriation. Its total size is rather in
excess of that of the largest mastaba yet discovered ; its materials
are finer and its construction more careful. The bareness
of the walls, therefore, can hardly be attributed to want ot
means on the part of the proprietor.
It is true that in many tombs the decorative works have never
advanced beyond the sketch stage ; but here, although the
building is in a good state of preservation, not the slightest
sign is to be discovered that any funerary ornamentation had
ever been attempted. It is difficult to see how such an anomaly
is to be accounted for e.xcept by the supposition that this is not
a tomb, and was never intended to be one. •
An examination of the well leads to the same conclusion. In
the mastaba the well is simply a vertical corridor of approach to
the mummy chamber. Here there is neither sarcophagus nor
any place to put one ; no enlargement of the well of any kind.
But of the three parts into which the t\'pical Egyptian tomb
may be divided, the most important is the mummy chamber. It
is the only one of three which is absolutely indispensable. It
could, in itself furnish all the necessary elements of a place oj
sepulture, because it could ensure the safety and repose of the
corpse entrusted to it. Where there is no mummy chamber there
can hardly be a tomb, strictly speaking.
The anomalous character of these arrangements, supposing the
building to be a tomb, disappears when it is looked upon as a
temple. Its bareness and simplicity agree entirely with the
descriptions given by Plutarch and the pseudo-Lucian of those
early Egyptian temples which the one saw with his own eyes and
the other knew by tradition. A well for providing the water
required by the Egyptian ritual and by the ablutions of the priests
would be in its proper place in such an edifice, while the similarity
between its general arrangements and those of the mastabas may
easily be accounted for by the inexperience of the early architect.
The forms at his command were too few and too rigid to enable
him to mark, with any certainty, tlie different purposes of the
buildings which he erected. The architect of this temple seems,



o 28 A HisTuRV OF Art in Ancient E(;vpt.
however, to have done his best to express the distinction. In
none of the Memphite mastabas do we find such spacious chambers or so many large and well-wrought monolithic columns.
Many hypotheses have been put forward in the attempt to
reconcile these two explanations of the " Temple of the Sphinx, "
but we cannot discuss them here. " Why," asks Mariette, in his
recently published memoir, " should not the temple of the Sphinx
be the tomb of the king who made the Sphinx itself.''" This question we may answer by two more : Why did not that king
decorate the walls of his tomb ? and why did he have neither sarcophagus nor sarcophagus chamber ? Others have seen in it
the chapel in which the funerary rites of Chei^hren were
performed ; ^ a theory which was of course suggested by the
discovery of that king's statu.es in the well. These statues,
we are told, must formerly have been arranged in one of the
chambers, and, in some moment of political tumult, they must
have been cast into the well either by foreign enemies or by the
irritated populace.
In all probability we shall never learn the true cause of this
insult to the memory of Chephren, and it seems to us to be
hazarding too much to affirm that, because the statues of that kine
were found in it, the building we are discussing must have been
his funerary chapel. It is very near the Sphinx, and it is a
considerable distance from the second pyramid," which, moreover,
had a temple of its own. According to all analogy, the funerary chapel would be in the immediate neighbourhood of the mummy
for whose benefit it was erected.
In the absence of any decisive evidence either one way or the
other, the most reasonable course is to look upon this building as
the temple in which the worship of the neighbouring Colossus was
carried on : as the temple of Harmachis, in a word. This solution
derives confirmation from the following facts mentioned by
Mariette: "The granite stele, erected by Thothmes IV. to
commemorate the works of restoration undertaken by him, was
placed against the right shoulder of the Sphinx, that is to say, at
the point nearest to the building which we are discussing. In
later years this stele and some others representing scenes of adoration which were added by Rameses II., were combined into
' B.tDEKB'.R, Guide to Lower Egypt, p. 350. - The actual ilistancc is about 670 yards.



The Temple under the Ancient Empire. 329
a sort of small building, which almost directly faced any one comino
out of the temple." ^ One of Mariette's favourite projects was to
clear the sphinx down to its base, to clear all the space between it
and the temple (see Fig. 204), and finally to build a wall round
the whole group of sufficient height to keep it free from sand in
the future. In Mariette's opinion such an operation could hardly
fail to bring to light more than one monument of great antiquity,
of an antiquity greater, perhaps, than that of the pyramids. In
any case it would lay open the material connection between
the great idol and its temple, and would help us to reconstitute
the most ancient group of religious buildings in existence.
Those structures which are generally called the temples of the
pyn-amids belong to the same class of architecture (Fig. 127). We
have already mentioned them, and explained how they are to the
pyramids what the funerary chamber is to the mastaba. We must
return to them for a moment in their capacity as temples. The
deceased kings in whose honour they were erected were
worshipped within their walls even down to the time of the
Ptolemies. They are in a much worse state of preservation than
the Temple of the Sphinx. Unlike the latter they were not
protected by the sand, and their materials could readily be carried
away for the construction of other buildings. Nothing remains
but the lower courses of the walls and their footings, so that no
exact agreement has yet been come to even as to their ground
plan. We shall quote, however, the description given by Jomard
of the temple belonging to the third pyramid. The French
savants, w-hose visit to Egypt took place nearly a century ago, saw many things which have disappeared since their time.
" The building situated to the east of the third pyramid is
remarkable for its arrangement, its extent, and the enormous size
of the blocks of which it is composed. In plan it is almost
square, being 177 feet by 186. On its eastern side there
is, however, a vestibule or annexe 103 feet long and 46
wide. . . . Outside the vestibule there is a vast courtyard with
two lateral openings or posterns ; beyond this there are several
spacious saloons, five of which are still in existence ; the farthest of
these is the same size as the vestibule, and is exactly opposite to
the centre of the pyramid, from which it is but 43 feet distant.

330 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
But I could see no opening in that part of the wall which faced
the pyramid. " The general symmetry of the arrangement, however, suffices
to prove the connection between the two buildings.
" After havine studied the construction and the materials of the
Theban edifices, I was astonished by the size of the stones here
made use of, and the care with which they were fixed. The walls
are 6 feet 9 inches thick ; a thickness which is determined by that
of the stones employed. Their length varies from 12 to 23 feet.
At first I took these blocks for the face of the rock itself,
elaborately worked and dressed, and I might not have discovered
my mistake but for the cemented joints betvt'een the courses.
" The eastward prolongation or annexe is formed of two huge
walls, which are not less than 13 feet 4 inches thick. It
may well be asked why such walls should have been constructed,
seeing that had they been of only half the thickness they would
have been quite as durable and solid.
" This building- forms, as it were, the continuation of an enclined
plane or causeway laid out at right angles to the base line of
the third pyramid, and leading up to it." ^
Jomard appears to have found no traces of pillars in any part
of the edifice ; but Belzoni, whose description is, however, both
short and confused, seems to have found them in the temple of the
second pyramid. He speaks oi -Sl portico, and he adds that some
of its blocks were 24 feet high,- or about the same height as the
monoliths in the Temple of the Sphinx. Such blocks would,
of course, be the first to be carried off and used elsewhere.
In spite of this difference many of the peculiar arrangements of
the sphinx temple are repeated in these buildings. There is the
same squareness of plan, the same multiplicity of internal
chambers, the same employment of huge masses of stone and the same care and skill in dressing and fixing them. It is now
impossible to say whether these buildings, when complete, were
decorated or not ; it is certain that at the present day no sign of
any ornamentation, either carved or painted, is to be found upon
them. We see, then, that the religious architecture of the early empire
is represented by a very small number of monuments, ot which

only one is in a good state of preservation. Wiien we recall the texts which we have quoted, when we compare the temple of the
Sphinx with tombs like the pyramids or the sepulchre of Ti, we must acknowledge that the energies of the Egyptians during the
early dynasties were mainly directed to their resting-places after
death, that the worship of the dead held the largest place in their
religious life. Their temples were small in size, insignificant in
height, and severe in their absence of ornament. They give
slight earnest of the magnificent edifices which the country was to
rear some ten or fifteen centuries afterwards at the command of
the great Theban pharaohs. The monolithic pillars, however, of
which we have spoken, give some slight foretaste of a feature
which was to reach unrivalled majesty in the hypostyle halls of Karnak and Luxor.
T/ie Temple under the Mieietle Empire.
No temples constructed under the first Theban empire are now
in existence ; and yet the Egyptians had then generally adopted
the worship of all those deities whose characters and attributes have been made known to us through the monuments of the NewEmpire. The Theban triad received the homage of the Ousourtesens and Amenemhats ; its principal personage, Amen,
or Amnion, identified with Ra, already showed a tendency to
become a supreme deity for the nation as a whole. To him
successful sovereigns attributed their successes both of peace and
war. As the god of the king and of the capital, Amen acquired
an uncontested superiority throughout the whole valley of the
Nile, which affected, however, neither the worship of the local deities, nor the homage paid by every man and woman in Egypt
to Osiris, the god to whom they looked for happiness beyond the grave.
Art, at this period, had advanced so far that there was no longer
any difficulty in marking the distinction between the temple and
the tomb. In the sepulchres at Beni- Hassan which date from the
twelfth dynasty, we find two very different kinds of support, and
there was nothing to prevent the forms employed in these rock-cut
chambers from beincr made use of in constructed buildines, seeing
especially how skilful the PZgyptians had shown themselves to be



334 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
in working the excellent materials provided for them by nature.
The architect could, if he had chosen, have multiplied to infinity
those stone supports which his distant predecessors had employed,
apparently with some inkling of their future possibilities. The
obelisk set up by Ousourtesen at Heliopolis, proves that the cutting and polishing of those monoliths was understood in his time, and as the obelisk seems always to have been closely combined with
the pylon, it is not improbable that the religious edifices of the
time of Ousourtesen were prefaced by those huge pyramidoid
masses. The hypostyle halls, the pylons, and the obelisks of
the New Empire differed from those of the Middle Empire rather
in their extent and in the magnificence of their decoration, than
in their orener^l arranrrement.
Of all the temples then constructed, the only one which has left
any apparent traces is that which was erected at Thebes by the
princes of the twelfth dynasty to the honour of Amen. It forms
the central nucleus around which the later buildings of Karnak
have been erected. The name of Ousourtesen is to be read upon the remains of the polygonal columns which mark, it is believed,
the site of the sanctuary properly speaking, between the granite
chambers and the buildings of Thothmes III. ; these columns, like
those at BeniTIassan, are hexagonal in section.^
Of many other buildings erected at this period, nothing is left to
us beyond tradition and the mere mention of them in various texts.
This, however, is sufficient to prove their existence. We shall
choose examples of them from the two extremities of Egypt.
Nothing has been found of that great tem[)le at Heliopolis which
all the Greek travellers visited and described, but we know that a
part, at least, of its buildings dated from the time of the first
Theban empire, because a MS. at Berlin, published by Herr
Ludwig Stern in 1873, narrates the dedication of a chapel by
Ousourtesen. It is probable that the obelisk was in the portion
then built and consecrated to the god Ra.
At Semneh, in Nubia, the fortress on the left bank of the river
contains a temple of Thothmes HI., which, according to the
pictures and inscriptions which cover its walls, is no more than a
1 The little that now remains of the columns and foundations of the ancient temple is marked in the plan which forms plate 6 of Mariette's A'lm/ak, Fig. a. In plate 8 the remains of all statues and inscriptions which date from the same
period are figured. See also pages 36, 37, and 41-45 of the text.



The Temple under the New Empire. 335
restoration of one built, in tlie first instance, in honour of
Ousourtesen III. This latter prince was deified at Semneh after
his death, and his worship continued for more than ten centuries.
His temple, which had fallen into ruin during the first reigns of the
eighteenth dynasty, was reconstructed by Thothmes, and that
prince is represented doing homage to the local deities, among
whom Ousourtesen may be discovered presenting his pious
successor to the other gods.
Many more instances might be given, but the monuments of the second Theban empire demand our attention. A Thothmes
or an Amenophis, a Seti or a Rameses, could dispose of all the
resources of a rich country and of an aged civilization for the
construction of their edifices, edifices so great and splendid that
they ran no risk of being destroyed in later times for the sake of
constructing others still more sumptuous ; besides which they were
built at the zenith of the national greatness, at the moment when,
in the Egyptian character, all the energy of an unconquered people was combined with the knowledge and experience
resulting from an old and complex social system. In the later
ages of the monarchy a few unimportant additions were made, an
obelisk or a pylon here, there a courts a colonnade, or a few chambers ; but the great temples of the New Empire have come
down to us with few modifications beyond those caused by the three thousand years through which they have existed, and we
have little difficulty in restoring them, on paper, to the condition in
which they were left by the great monarchs of the eighteenth,
nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties. The later additions, although
they render the ground-plans more complicated, fail to hide or
materially affect the general characteristics of the buildings, and in
no way prevent us from recognizing and defining the spirit and
originality of their conception.
§ 3. The Temple under tlie Nezo Empire.
Before we cross the threshold of the great Theban temples and
attempt to evolve order out of their complexity of courts, halls,
porticos and colonnades, it may be convenient to describe their
approaches. Each temple had its external and accessory parts
which had their share in the relieious ceremonies of which it was

the theatre, and it would be diiticult to make its economy under
stood unless we began by noticing them in detail.
One of the first signs which denoted to visitors the proximity of
an Egyptian temple was what the Greek travellers called a Bpofj.of,
that is to say a paved causeway bordered on each side with rams
or sphinxes, their heads being turned inwards to the road. These
avenues vary in width, that at Karnak is 76 feet between the
inner faces of the pedestals ; ^ within the precincts of the sacred
Fig. 205. — Ram, or A'riosphinx, from Karnak.
edifice, between the first and second pylon, this width underwent a
considerable increase. The space between one sphinx and another on the same side of the causeway was about 1 3 feet. The dronws which led from Luxor to Karnak was about 2,200 yards long; there must, therefore, have been five hundred sphinxes on each side of it. At the Serapeum of Memphis the sphinxes which
Mariette found by digging 70 feet downwards into the sand
' Mariette, Karnak, ]>. 4.



TiiK Temple under the New Empire.
were still nearer to one another ; ^ the dromos which they lined
was found to be 50 feet wide and about 1,650 yards long.
Following our modern notions we should, perhaps, expect to find
these causeways laid out upon an exactly rectilinear plan. They
are not so, however. It has sometimes been said that one of the
characteristic features of Egyptian architecture is its dislike, or
rather hatred, of a rigorous symmetry. Traces of this hatred are
to be found in these avenues. The very short ones, such as those which extend between one pylon and another, are straight,
but those which are prolonged for some distance outside the build
ings of the temple almost always make some abrupt turns. The Serapeum dronws undergoes several slight changes of direction,
in order, no doubt, to avoid the tombs between which its course lay.
We find the same thing at Karnak, where the architect must have
had different motives for his abandonment of a straight line. At
the point where the man-headed sphin.xes of Horus succeed to those
sphinxes without inscriptions the date of which Mariette found it
impossible to determine, the axis of the avenue inclines gently to
the left.
These avenues of sphinxes are always outside the actual walls
of the temple, from which it has been inferred that they were
merely ornamental, and without religious signification.

Some of the great temples have several of these avenues leading
up to their different gates. It is within these gates only that the
sacred inclosure called by the Greeks the Tefi€vo9 commences.
The religious ceremonies were all performed within this space,
which was inclosed by an encircling wall built at sufficient distance
from the actual temple to allow of the marshalling of processions
and other acts of ritual.
These outer walls are of crude brick. At Karnak they are
about 33 feet thick, but as their upper parts have disappeared
through the perishable nature of the material, it is impossible to
say with certainty what their original height may have been.^
' We may infer from what Mariette says that they were separated from one another by a distance of 1 2 feet 4 inches. ^ Mariette, Karnak, p. 5. We find, however, that sphinxes were sometimes placed in the interior of a temple. The two fine sphinxes in rose granite which form the chief ornaments of the principal court of the Boulak museum, were found in one of the inner halls of the temple at Karnak. They date, probably, from the time of Thothmes III., to whom this part of the building owes its existence.

Their summits, with their crenellated parapets, must have afforded
a continuous platform connected with the flat tops of the pylons
by flights of steps.
" These inclosing walls served more than one purpose. They
marked the external limits of the temple. They protected it
against injury from without. When their height was considerable,
as at Denderah, Sais, and other places, they acted as an impenetrable
curtain between the profane curiosity of the external crowd and the
mysteries performed Avithin ; and when they had to serve their last
named purpose they were constructed in such a fashion that those
without could neither hear nor see anything that passed.
"It is probable that the walls of Karnak served all three
purposes. There are four of them, connected one with another by
avenues of sphinxes, and all the sacred parts of the building,
except a few chapels, are in one of the four inclosures. . . . Their
height was at least sufficient to prevent any part of the inside from
being overlooked from any (quarter of the city, so that the cere
monies in the halls, under the colonnades, or upon the lakes could
be proceeded with in strict isolation from the outer world. ^ We
may therefore perceive that, on certain occasions, these inclosures
would afiord a sanctuary which could not easily be violated, while
they would keep all those who had not been completely initiated
at a respectful distance from the holy places within."
These walls were pierced in places by stone doorways, embedded
in the masses of crude brick, whose highest parts always rose
more or less above the battlements of the wall (Fig. 206). At
those points where the sphinx avenues terminated, generally at the
principal entrance of the temple but sometimes at secondary gateways, these portals expanded into those towering masses which
by their form as well as their size, so greatly impress the traveller
who visits the ruins of ancient Egypt. These masses have by

Its surface is perfectly smooth and naked, without ornament of any kind, or even rough-cast (Mariette, Denderah, p. 27.) At Karnak the bounding walls are in a much worse state of preservation ; they are ten or twelve centuries older than those of Denderah, and those centuries have had their effect upon the masses of crude brick. Our only means of estimating their original height is by comparing, in the representations furnished to us by certain bas-reliefs, the height of walls with that of the pylons on which they abut. - Mariette, Karnak, pp. 5, 6.

common consent been named />j/o//s. They seem to have been in
great favour with the architects of Egypt, who succeeded by their
means in rendering their buildings still more original than they
would have been without them.^ The pylon is composed of three parts intimately allied one with
another ; a tall rectangular doorway is flanked on either hand by a
pyramidal mass rising high above its crown. Both portal and
towers terminate above in that hollow gorge which forms the
cornice of nearly all Egyptian buildings. Each angle of the
towers is accentuated by a cylindrical moulding, which adds to the
firmness of its outlines. This moulding bounds all the flat
surfaces of the pylon, which are, moreover, covered with bas-reliefs
and paintings. It serves as a frame for all this decoration, which it
cuts oft' from the cornice and from the uneven line which marks the
junction of the sloping walls with the sandy soil. From the base
of the pylon spring those vertical masts from whose summits many
coloured streamers flutter in the sun.- In consequence of the inclina
tion of the walls, these masts, being themselves perpendicular, were
some distance from the face of the pylon at its upper part. Brackets
of wood were therefore contrived, through which the masts passed
and by which their upright position was preserved ; without some
such support they would either have been liable to be blown down
in a high wind, or would have had to follow the inclination of the wall to which they were attached, which would have been an
' The word tt-dAiui' strictly means the pl.ice before the door (hke dvpwv), or rather great door (upon the augmentative force of the suffix wr, uivo%, see Ad. Regnier, Traitc de la Formation des Mots dans /a Langue Grecque, § 1 84). Several passages in PoLVBius {Thesaurus., s. v.) show that in the military language of his time the term was employed to signify a fortified doorway with its flanking towers and other defences. We may therefore understand why Diodorus (i. 47) made use of it in his description of the so-called tomb of Osymandias. .Strabo (xvii. i, 28) preferred to use the word irp6TTv\iav. Modern usage has restricted the word propylaum to Greek buildings, and pylon to the great doorways which form one of the most striking features of Egyptian architecture. ''' We learn the part played by these masts and banners in Egyptian decoration entirely from the representations in the bas-reliefs. The fai^ade of the temple of
Khons is illustrated in one of the bas-reliefs upon the same building. That relief was reproduced in the Description dc I'Egypte (vol. iii. pi. 57, Fig. 9), and is so well known that we refrained from giving it in these pages. It shows the masts and banners in all their details. Another representation of the same kind will be found
in Cailli.aud,; Voyage a Mi-roe, plates, vol. ii. pi. 64, Fig. i. See in the text, vol. iii. p. 29S. It is taken from a rock-cut tomb between Dayr-el-Medinet and Medinet-.\bou.

unsightly arrangement. " The interiors of the pylons were partly hollow ; they inclosed small chambers to which access was obtained by narrow staircases winding round a central square newel. The object of these chambers seems to have been merely
to facilitate the manoeuvring of the masts and their floating banners,
because when the latter were in place, the small openings which
gave light to the chambers were entirely obscured.
If the pylons had been intended for defensive purposes, the
doors in their centres would have been kept in rear of the flanking
towers, as in more modern fortifications. But instead of that
being the case they are slightly salient, which proves conclusively
that their object was purely decorative.
The pylon which we have taken as a type of such erections,
is one of those which inclose a doorway opening in the centre of
one of the sides of the brick inclosure, it may be called an external
pylon, or a pro-pylon, to make use of the word proposed by M. Ampere, but in all temples of any importance several pylons
have to be passed before the sanctuary is reached. At Karnak,
for instance, in approaching the great temple from the temple
of Mouth, the visitor passes under four pylons, only one of which,
the most southern, is connected with the inclosing wall. So,
too, on the west. After passing the pylon in the outer wall,
another has to be passed before the hypostyle hall is reached, and
a third immediately afterwards. Then, behind the narrow court
which seems to cut the great mass of buildings into two almost
equal parts, there are three more at very slight intervals. Thus
M. Mariette counts six pylons, progressively diminishing in size,
which lie in the way of the visitor entering Karnak by the west
and passing to the east. At Lu.Kor there are three.
A glance at our "general view of the buildings of Karnak will
give a good idea of the various uses to which the Egyptian archi
tect put the pylon. 1 There is the pro-pylon ; there are those
pylons which, when connected with curtain walls, separate one
courtyard from another ; there are those again, which, placed
immediately in front of the hypostyle halls, form the fa9ades
of the temples properly speaking. The temple is always con

cealed behind a pylon, whose summit rises above it while its
two wings stretch beyond it laterally until they meet the rect
angular wall which incloses the sanctuary.
The dimensions of pylons vary with those of the temples to
which they belong. The largest still existing is the outer pylon
of the great temple of Karnak. It was constructed in Ptolemaic
times. Its two chief masses are 146 feet high, or about equal
to the \'endome column in Paris. This pylon is 376 feet
wide at the widest part and 50 feet thick. The first pylon
at Luxor, which was built by Rameses II., is less gigantic in its
proportions than this ; it is, however, 76 feet high, each of
its two great masses is 100 feet wide, and the portal in the
middle is 56 feet high (see Fig. 207).
In those temples which were really complete, obelisks were
erected a few feet in front of the pylons, and immediately behind
the obelisks, in contact with the pylons themselves, were jDlaced those colossal statues by which every Egyptian monarch commemo
rated his connection with the structures which were reared in
his time. The obelisks are generallv two in number, the colossi
vary from four to six for each pylon, according to the magnificence
of the temple. The obelisks range in height from about 60 to
100 feet, and the statues from 20 to 45 feet.^ Obelisks and
colossal statues seem to have been peculiarly necessary outside
the first, or outer, pylon of a temple. This produced an
effect upon the visitor at the earliest moment, before he had
entered the sacred inclosure itself But they are also to be
found before the inner pylons, a repetition which is explained
by the fact that such temples as those of Karnak and Luxor
were not the result of a single effort of construction. Each
of the successive pylons which met the visitor during the last
centuries of Egyptian civilization had been at one time the front
of the whole edifice.
To complete our description of the external i:)arts of the temple
' The obelisk of Ousourtesen at Heliopolis is 20"2 7 metres, or 67 feet 6 inches, high; the Luxor obeHsk at Paris, 22-80 metres, or 76 feet; that in the piazza before St. Peter's in Rome, 83 feet 9 inches ; that of San Giovanni I.aterano, the tallest in Europe, is 107 feet 2 inches ; and that of Queen Hatasu, still standing amid the ruins at Karnak, 32-20 metres, or 107 feet 4 inches. This is the highest obelisk known. [The Cleopatra's Needle on the Victoria Embankment is only 68 feet 2 inches high.

344 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
we have yet to mention tliose small lakes or basins which have
been found within the precincts of all the g-reater temples. Their
position wuthin the inclosing walls suggests that they were used
for other purposes beyond such ablutions as those which are
prescribed for all good Mohammedans. If nothing but washing
was in view they might have been outside the inclosure, so that
intending worshippers could discharge that part of their duty
before crossing the sacred threshold ; but their situation behind
the impenetrable veil of such walls as those we have described,
suggests that they had to play a part in those religious mysteries
which could not be performed within sight of the profane. Upon
certain festivals richly decorated boats, bearing the images or
emblems of the gods, were set afloat upon these lakes. As
the diurnal and nocturnal journeys of the sun were looked upon
as voyages by navigation across the spaces of heaven and
through the shadows of the regions below, it may easily be
understood how a miniature voyage by water came to have a
place in the worship of deities who were more or less solar in
their character.
We have now arrived upon the threshold of the temple itself,
and we must attempt to describe and define that edifice, distin
guishing from each other its essential and accessory parts.
When we cast our eyes for the first time either upon the con
fused but imposing ruins of Karnak themselves, or upon one of
the plans which represent them, it seems a hopeless task to evolve
order from such a chaos of pylons, columns, colossal statues and
obelisks, from such a tangled mass of halls and porticos, corridors
and narrow chambers. If we begin, however, by studying some of
the less complex structures we soon find that many of these
numerous chambers, in spite of their curious differences, were
repetitions of one another so far as their significance in the
general plan is concerned. Wlien a temple was complete in
all its parts any monarch who desired that his name too should be
connected with it in the eyes of posterity, had no resource but to
add some new building to it, which, under the circumstances
supposed, could be nothing but a mere replica of some part already
in existence.^ They took some element of the general plan, such
' At Thebes, still existing inscriptions prove this to be the case, and at Memphis the same custom obtained, as we know from the statements of the Greek travellers.

as the hypostyle hall at Karnak, and added to it over and over
again, giving rise to interesting changes in the proportion, arrangement and decoration.
One of the most intelligent of the ancient travellers, namely,
Strabo, attempted the work of discrimination which it is now
our duty to undertake. He wrote for people accustomed to
the clear and simple arrangements of the Greek temple, and
he attempted to give them some idea of the Egyptian temple,
such as he found it in that Heliopolis whose buildings made such
an impression upon all the Greeks who saw them.^
His description is, perhaps, rather superficial. It says nothing
of some accessory parts which were by no means without their
importance, and those details which most strongly attracted the
author's attention are not mentioned in their natural order, which
would seem to be that in which the visitor from without would
meet them in his course from the main door to the sanctuary. But Strabo had one great advantage over a modern writer. He
saw all these great buildings in their entirety, and could follow
their arrangement with an easy certainty which is impossible in
our day, when so many of them present nothing but a confused mass of ruins, and some indeed, such as the temple at Luxor, are
partly hidden by modern ruins. We shall, then, take Strabo for
our guide, but we shall endeavour to give our descriptions in
better sequence than his, and to fill up some of the gaps in his
account by the study of those remains which are in the best state
of preservation. In our descriptions we shall advance from
simple buildings to those which are more complex. We should soon lose the thread of our argument if we were to begin by
attacking temples which are at once so complicated and so muti
lated as those of Karnak and Luxor. The character of each of
statue of Rameses which still lies there upon its face—must have rivalled Karnak in extent and in the number of its successive additions. According to Diodorus (i. 50) it was Maris (Amenemhat III.) who built the southern propylons of this temple, which, according to the same authority, surpassed all their rivals in magnificence. At a much later period, Sesostris (a Rameses) erected several colossal monoliths, from 20 to 30 cubits high, in front of the same tem]3le (Diodorus, cap. Ivii. ; Herodotus, ii. 140) ; at the same time he must have raised obelisks and constructed courts and pylons. Herodotus attributes to two other kings, whom he names R/iampsinite and Asychis, the construction of two more pylons on the eastern and western sides of the temple (ii. 121 and 136). Finally Psemethek I. built the southern propylons and the pavilion where the Apis was nursed after his first discovery.
Herodotus, ii. 153.) I. Strabo, xvii, i, 28.



348 A History of Art in Anxiext Egypt.
the elements of an Egyptian temple of this period will be readily
perceived if we begin our researches with one which is at once
well preserved, simple in its arrangements, and without those
successive additions which do so much to complicate a plan. Of all the ruins at Thebes the Temple of Khons, which stands to the south-west of the great temple at Karnak, is that which
most completely fulfils these conditions.-^ Time has not treated it
very badly, and, although the painted decoration may be the work
of several successive princes, we are inclined to believe from the
simplicity of the plan that most of the architectural part of the work was begun and completed by Rameses III.
The advanced pylon, or prop\lon, which stands some forty
metres in front of the whole building and was erected by Ptolemy Euergetes, may be omitted from our examination. The really
ancient part of the structure begins with the rows of sphinxes
which border the road behind the propylon. They lead up to a
pylon of much more modest dimensions than that of Ptolemy.
In front of this pylon there is ho trace of either obelisks or colossal
figures. As the whole temple is no more than about 233 feet
long and 67 feet wide, it may not have been thought worthy of
such ornaments, or perhaps their small size may have led to their
removal. In any case, Strabo appears to have seen religious
edifices in front of which there were neither obelisks nor the
statues of royal founders.
Immediately behind this pylon lay a rectangular court sur
rounded by a portico of two rows of columns standing in front of
a solid wall. In this wall and in the columns in front of it we
recognise the tuings of which Strabo speaks ; the two walls of the
same height as those of the temple, n'hieh are prolongedin front of the
proiaos. There is but one difficulty. Strabo says that the space
between these walls diminishes as they approach the sanctuary.
His court must therefore have been a trapezium with its smallest
side opposite to the pylon, rather than a rectangle. We have
searched in vain for such a form among the plans of those pharaonic

temples which have been measured. In every instance the sides
of the peristylar court form a rectangular parallelogram. It must,
apparently, have been in a Ptolemaic temple that Strabo noticed
these converging sides, and even then he was mistaken in supposing such an arrangement to be customary. The Ptolemaic
temples which we know, those of DcudcraJi, Ed/on, Esiic/i, have all
a court as preface to the sanctuary, but in every case those courts
are rectangular. In the great temple of Philae alone do we find
the absence of parallelism of which Strabo speaks,^ the peristylar
court which follows the second pylon is rather narrower at its
further extremity than immediately behind the pylon. In
presence of this example of the trapezium form we may allow
that it is quite possible that in the temples of Lower and Middle
Egypt, which have perished, the form in question was more
frequently employed than in those of Upper Egypt, where,
among the remains of so many buildings, we find it but once.
To return to the Temple of Khons. From the courtyard of
which we have been speaking, a high portal opens into a hall of
little depth but of a width equal to that of the whole temple.
The roof of this hall is supported by eight columns, the central
four beinof rather hio-her than the others.- It is to this room that
the name of hypostyle hall has been given. We can easily under
stand how Strabo saw in it the equivalent to the />ro7iaos of the
Greek temples. We know how in the great peripteral buildings
of Greece and Italy, \\\e. pronaos prefaced the entrance to the cclla with a double and sometimes a triple row of columns. Except
that it is entirely inclosed by its walls, the Egyptian hypostyle
had much the same appearance as the Greek pronaos. Its
name in those texts which treat of its construction is the large
hall ; but it is also called the Hall of Assembly and the Hall of the
Appearance , terms which explain themselves. Only the kings and
priests were allowed to penetrate into the sanctuary for the
purpose of bringing forth the emblem or statue of the god from
the tabernacle or other receptacle in which it was kept. This
emblem or figure was placed either in a sacred boat or in one of
those portable wooden tabernacles in which it was carried round
the sacred inclosure to various resting places or altars. The
crowd of priests and others who had been initiated but were of

inferior rank awaited the appearance of the deity in the hypostyle
hall, in which the cortege was marshalled before emerging into
the courts.
The second division of the temple, for Strabo, was the sanc
tuary, or a'r)Kos. In this Temple of Khons it was a rectangular
chamber, separated by a wide corridor running round its four sides
from two smaller chambers, which filled the spaces between the
corridor and the external walls. In this hall fragments of a

granite pedestal have been discovered, upon which either the A?;-?
or sacred boat, which is so often figured upon the bas-reliefs
(Fig. 209), or some other receptacle containing the peculiar
emblem of the local divinity, must have been placed. Strabo
was no doubt correct in saying that the a-qKos differed from the cclla
of the Greek temple in that it contained no statue of the divinity,
but nevertheless it must have had something to distinguish it
from the less sacred parts of the building. This something was a
kind of little chapel, tabernacle, or shrine, closed by a folding

door, and containing either an emblem or a statue of the divinity,
before which prayers were recited and rehgioiis ceremonies per
formed on certain stated days. Sometimes tliis slirine was no
more than an inclosed niche in the wall, sometimes it was a little
edifice set up in the middle of the sanctuary. In those cases in
which it was a structure of painted and gilded wood, like the ark
of the Hebrews, it has generally disappeared and left no trace
behind. The tabernacle in the Turin Museum (Fig 210) is one
of the few objects of the kind which have escaped complete
destruction. In temples of any importance the shrine was
hollowed out of a block of granite or basalt. A monolithic chapel
of this kind is still in place in the Ptolemaic temple of Edfou ;
it bears the royal oval of Nectanebo I.^ E.xamples are to be
found in all the important European museums. One of the finest belongs to the Louvre and bears the name of Amasis ; it is of
red granite and is entirely covered with inscriptions and sculpture
(Fig. 211).'- It must resemble, on a smaller scale, the tabernacle prepared in the Elephantine workshops, under Amasis, for the
temple of Neith, at Sais, which so greatly excited the admiration of Herodotus.^
The doors of the shrine were kept shut and even sealed up.
The king and the chief priest alone had the right to open them
and to pay their devotions before the image or symbol which
they inclosed. This seems clearly proved by the following
passage from the famous stele discovered by Mariette at GcbclBarkal, upon which the Ethiopian conqueror Piankhi-Mer-Amen
celebrates his victories and the occupation of Egypt from south to
north. After noticing the capture of Memphis he tells us that he
stopped at Heliopolis in order that he might sacrifice to the gods
in the royal fashion :
'' He mounted the steps which led to the

case however. Like most of the Greek temples, the Egyptian temple had its further chambers which served nearly the same
purposes as the owiadcF^o/^oi of the Greeks. Thus in the Temple of

hall which is smaller than the first and has its roof supported

by only four columns instead of eight. Upon this hall open
four small and separate chambers which fill up the whole space between it and the main walls.
Similar general arrangements to those of the Temple of Khons
are to be found in even the largest temples. The second hypostyle hall is however much larger and the chambers to which it gives
access much more numerous. It is not easy to determine the
object of each of these small apartments ; in the Pharaonic temples
they are usually in very bad condition, but in some of the
Ptolemaic buildings, such as the temples of Edfou and Denderah,
they are comparatively well preserved. In the last named the
question is complicated by the existence of numerous blind

passages contrived in the thickness of the walls. The stone
which stopped the opening into these passages seems to have been manipulated by some secret mechanism.^ Some of the sacred images and such emblems as were made of precious
materials were kept in these hiding places. Their absolute
darkness and the coolness which accompanied it, were both

Herodotus's story was at least founded upon fact, as the arrangement in question was a favojrite one with Egyptian constructors.



356 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
conducive to the preservation of delicately ornamented objects
in such a climate as that of Egypt.
It was this part of the temple, then, that the Greeks called
the treasure-house. It inclosed the material objects of worship.
Some of its chambers, however, were consecrated to particular
divinities and seem to have had somewhat of the same character as the apsidal chapels of a Roman Catholic Church. They are
material witnesses to the piety of the princes who built them
and who wished to associate the divinities in whose honour
they were raised with the worship of the god to whom the temple
as a whole had been dedicated. Whether store-rooms or chapels,
these apartments might be multiplied to any extent and might
present great varieties of aspect. At Karnak, therefore, where
they communicate with long and wide galleries, they are very numerous. One of them was that small chamber which was
dismantled thirty years ago by Prisse d'Avennes and transported to
Paris. It is known as the Hall of Ancestors. In it Thothmes III.
is, in fact, represented in the act of worshipping sixty kings
chosen from among his predecessors on the Egyptian throne.
The last feature noticed by Strabo in the small temple taken
by him as a type, was the sculpture with which its walls were
lavishly covered. These works reminded him of Etruscan sculp
ture and of Greek productions of the archaic period, but we can
divine from the expressions ' of which he makes use, that he
perceiveil the principles which governed the Egyptian sculptor
to be different from those of the Greeks. The Greek architect
reserved certain strictly circumscribed places for sculpture, such
as the friezes and pediments of the temples, while in Egypt it
spreads itself indiscriminately over every surface. In the temple
of Khons, as in every other building of the same kind at Thebes,
we find this uninterrupted decoration. Mariette has shown the
interesting nature ol these representations and their value to
the historian.
We have still to notice, always keeping the same edifice
in view, two original points in the characteristic physiognomy
of the Egyptian temple which seem to have escaped the attention
of the Greek traveller.
In the Greek temple there is no space inclosed by a solid
wall but that of the cclla, which, by its purpose, answers to
^ 'ArayAi'^as 5' i)^o\•cnv 01 TOijj^ot ovtoi /xtyaAoji' cidwAcui' (StRABO, XVll, I, 28).

the arinos of the Egyptian buildings. Both the peristyle and
the pronaos are open to the air and to the view of all comers ;
the statues of the pediments, the reliefs of the friezes are all
visible from outside, and the eye rejoices freely both in master
pieces of sculpture and in the long files of columns, which
vary in effect as they are looked at from different points of view.
The appearance of the Egyptian temple is altogether dissimilar.
The peristylar court, the hypostyle hall, the sanctuary and its
adjuncts, in a word the whole combination of chambers and
courts which form the temple proper, is surrounded by a curtain
wall which is at least as high as the buildings which it incloses.
Before any idea of the richness and architectural magnificence
of the temple itself can be formed, this wall must be passed.
From the outside nothing is to be seen but a great retangular
mass of building, the inclined faces of which seem to be endea
vouring to meet at the top so as to give the greatest possible
amount of privacy and security to the proceedings which take
place within. The Egyptian temple may, in a word, be compared
to a bo.x (Fig. 61), and in such buildings as that dedicated to
Khons, the box is a simple rectangular one. The partitions
which separate its various halls and chambers are kept within
the main wall. But in larger buildings the box is, partially at
least, a double one. When we examine a plan of the great
temple at Karnak, we see that all the back part of the vast
pile, all that lies to the west of the open passage and the
fourth pylon, is inclosed by a double wall. A sort of wide
corridor, open to the sky, lies between the outer wall and that
which immediately surrounds the various chambers. This outer
wall is absent only on the side closed by the inner pylon. In
some temples, especially in those of the Ptolemaic period, the
hypost)le hall is withdrawn some distance behind the courtyard,
and the sanctuary behind the hypostyle hall. This arrangement
is repeated in the position of the two walls. The inner one
embraces the chambers of the temple and follows their irregulari
ties ; the other describes three sides of a rectangle leaving a
wider space at the back of the temple than at the sides. The
pylon, as we have said, supplies the fourth side. This outer
wall has no opening of any kind. It is true that at Karnak
lateral openings exist in the hypostyle hall and in the courtyard,
but those parts were less sacred in their character than the inner

point where the wall be

the posterior wall of the
hypostyle hall, there are no more external openings
of any kind. To reach

constant sunlight of Egypt ; besides which there were openings just
under the cornice and above tlie capitals of the columns. When the
door was open, therefore, there would be no want of light, although
it would be softened to a certain extent. The sanctuary was much darker. The light which came through the door was
borrowed from the hypostyle hall. The hall with the four supporting columns and the chambers which surrounded it were
still worse provided than the sanctuary ; the first named was
feebly illuminated by small openings in the stone roof the latter
were in almost complete darkness. The only one which could
have enjoyed a little light was that which lay on the central axis
of the building. A few feeble rays may have found their way
to this chamber when the doors of the temple were open, but, as a rule, they seem to have been closed. Marks of hinges
have been found in the Egyptian temples, and it is certain that
the sanctuary was permanently closed in some fashion against
the unbidden visits of the curious.^
We shall return elsewhere to the illumination of the Egyptian
temples, and shall discuss the various methods made use ot
to ensure sufficient light for the enjoyment of the sumptuous
decorations lavished upon them ; here, however, it will be
sufficient if we indicate their general character, which is the same
in all the religious edifices in the country.
The largest- and best lighted chambers are those nearest to the
entrance. As we leave the last pylon behind and penetrate deeply
into the temple, the light gradually becomes less and the chambers
diminish in size, until the building comes to an end in a number of
small apartments in which the darkness is unbroken. There are even some temples which become gradually narrower and lower
from front to back ; this is especially the case with those which
have a double wall round their more sacred parts.
This progressive diminution is even more clearly marked in a
vertical section than in one taken horizontally. The pylon is
much higher than any other point in the building. After the
' Description de TEgypte, Anfi/juites, vol. i. p. 219. The authors of tlie Description ghiirale de Thebes noticed recesses sunk in the external face of one of the pylons at Karnak, which they believed to be intended to receive the leaves of the great door when it was open (p. 234); they also noticed traces of bronze pivots upon which the doors swung (p. 248), and they actually found a pivot of sycamore wood.



360 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
pylon, in the temple of Khons, comes the portico \vhich surrounds
the courtyard. Next come in their order the columns of the
hypostyle hall, the roof of the sanctuary, the roof of the chamber
with four columns, and the roof of the last small apartment which
rests upon the inclosing wall. Between the large hypostyle hall
and the smaller one there is a difference in height amounting to a
quarter of the whole height of the former.
In the most important temples, such as those of Karnak,
Luxor, and the Ramesseum, the same laiu of constant diviiniition
in height from front to rear holds good, with the exception that in
their cases it is the hypostyle hall which is the highest point in the
building after the pylons. In this hall their architects have
raised the loftiest columns, and it is after these that the pro
gressive diminution begins. The longitudinal section of the
temple of Luxor (Fig. 213) and the general view of Karnak
(plate iv.) illustrate this statement.
As the roofs of the temple chambers are gradually lowered,
their carefully paved floors are raised, but not to an equal degree.
In the temple Khons four steps lead up from the court to the
hypostyle hall, and one step from the hall to the sanctuary.
Similar arrangements are found elsewhere. At Karnak a con
siderable flight is interposed between the courtyard and the
vestibule of the hypostyle hall. At Luxor the level of the second
court is higher than that of the first. In the Ramesseum there are
three flights of steps between the first and second hypostyle hall.
All these buildings are provided with staircases by which their
flat roofs may be reached. These roofs seem to have been freely
opened to the people. The interiors of the temples were only to
be visited by the priests, except on a few stated days and in a
fashion prescribed by the Egyptian ritual ; but the general public
were allowed to mount to the roofs, just as with us they are
allowed to ascend domes and belfries for the sake of the view over
the surrounding buildings and country. The numerous ^77?^7/,
some in the hieroglyphic, others in the demotic character, which
are still to be seen upon the roof of the temple of Khons, attest
this fact.
We thus find the characteristic features of Egyptian architecture
united in a single building in this temple of Khons ; but, even
at Thebes, no such similarity between one building and another
is to be found as in the great temples of Greece. In passing from

the Parthenon to the temple of Theseus
or to that of Jupiter Olympius, from a
Doric to an Ionic, and from an Ionic to a
Corinthian building, certain well marked
variations, certain changes of style, pro
portion and decoration are seen. But the
differences are never sufficient to embarrass
the student of those buildings. The object
of each part remains sufficiently well
defined and immutable to be easily re
cognised by one who has mastered a single
example. In Egypt the variations are
much greater even amontj buildincrs erected
during a single dynasty and by a single
architect. After the attentive study of
some simple and well marked building,
like the temple of Khons, the visitor pro
ceeds to inspect the ruins of Karnak, Luxor, the Ramesseum, Medinet-Abou or Gournah, and attempts to restore something
like order in his mind while walking- amongr
their ruins. But in vain are the rules
remembered which were thought to apply
to all such buildings ; they are of little
help in unravelling the mazes of Karnak
or Luxor, and at each new ruin explored
the visitor's perple.xities begin anew.
The variations are, in fact, very great,
but they are not so great as they seem
at the first glance. They are generally to
be explained by those developments and
repetitions of which Egyptian architects
were so fond. We shall endeavour to
demonstrate this by glancing rapidly at
each of the more celebrated Theban build
ings in turn. Our purpose does not
require that we should describe any of
them in detail, as we have already done
in the case of the temple of Khons, and
we shall be content with noticing their

variations upon the type established by our study of the minor monument.
Let us take Karnak first. This, the most colossal assemblage
of ruins which the world has to show, comprises no less than
eleven separate temples within its four inclosing walls of crude
brick. The longest axis of this collection of ruins is that from
north to south ; it measures about 1,560 yards; its transverse axis
is 620 yards long. The whole circuit of the walls is nearly two
English miles and a half ^
The first thing that strikes us in looking at a general map of
Karnak is that Egyptian temples were not oriented.^ The Great
Temple is turned to the west, that of Khons to the south, that of
IMouth to the north. There is some doubt as to the name which
should be driven to several of these buildintrs. Two of the most
important are consecrated to those deities who, with Amen, form
the Theban triad. The highest and largest of them all, that
which is called the Great Temple, is dedicated to Amen-Ra.
We are here concerned with the latter building only. We
reproduce, on a much larger scale and in two parts (Fig. 214 on
on page 363, and Pig. 215 on page 367), the plan given on page
35S (Fig- 212). A few figures will suffice to give an idea of the
several dimensions. From the external doorway of the first
w^estern pylon to the eastern extremity of the building, the length,
over all, is 1,215 f^et. Its greatest width is that of the first
pylon, namely 376 feet. The total circumference of the
bounding wall is about 3,165 feet. The outside curtain wall of
brick is from 2,500 to 2,700 yards in length, which corresponds
closely to the 13 stadia said by Diodorus to be the circumference
of the oldest of the four great Theban temples.^
After passing the first pylon (No. i on the plan) we find our
selves in a peristylar court answering to that in the temple of
Khons. On our right and left respectively we leave two smaller
temples, one of which (C on plan) cuts through the outer wall and

- We have not given a general map. In order to do so we should either have liad to overpass the limits of our page, or we should have had to give it upon too small a scale.

was built by Rameses III.; Seti 1 1, was the author of the other (D).
Those two buildings are older than the court and its colonnades. When the princes of the twenty-second dynasty added this
peristyle to the already constructed pnrts of the great temple,
they refrained from destroying those monuments to the piety of
their ancestors. We also may regard these temples as mere
accidents in the general arrangement. We may follow the path
marked out down the centre of the court by the remains of an
avenue of columns which dates from the times of the Ethiopian
conquerors and of the Bubastide kings (E). After the second
pylon {2) comes the hypostyle hall, the wonder of Karnak, and
the largest room constructed by the Egyptians (E). It is 340
feet long by 170 wide. ^ One hundred and thirty-four colossal
columns support, or rather did once support, the roof, which, in
the central portion, was not less than 76 feet above the floor
;
in this central portion, twelve pillars of larger proportions than
the others form an avenue ; these columns are i i feet 10 inches
in diameter and more than t,^ feet in circumference, so that, in
bulk, they are equal to the column of Trajan. They are, without
a doubt, the most massive pillars ever employed within a building.
I'^'om the ground to the summit of the cube which supports the
architrave, they are 70 feet high. Right and left of the
central avenue the remaining 122 columns form a forest of
pillars supporting a flat roof, which is lower than that of the
central part by 33 feet. The cathedral of Notre Dame, at
' These are the figures given byMARiETTE {Ttiiu'rairc dc la Haute-Egyptc, p. 135). Other authorities give 340 feet by 177. Diodorus ascribed to the temple of which he spoke a height of 45 cubits (or 69 feet 3 inches). This is slightly below the true height. We may here quote the terms in which Champollion describes the impression which a first sight of these ruins made upon him : " Finally I went to the palace, or rather to the town of palaces, at Karnak, There all the magnificence of the Pharaohs is collected ; there the greatest artistic conceptions formed and realised by mankind are to be seen. All that I had seen at Thebes, all that I had entluisiastically admired on the left bank of the river, sunk into insignificance before the gigantic structures among which I found myself. I shall not attempt to describe what I saw. If my expressions were to convey but a thousandth part of what I felt, a thousandth part of all that might with truth be said of such objects, if I succeeded in tracing but a faint sketch, in the dimmest colours, of the marvels of Karnak, I should be taken, at least for an enthusiast, perhaps for a madman. I shall content myself with saying that no people, either ancient or modern, have had a national architecture at once so sublime in scale, so grand in expression, and so free from littleness as that of the ancient l-'gyptians." [Ltffirs 1/' Egy/>h\ pp. 79, So.)

Paris, would stand easily upon the surface covered by this hall
(see Plate V).
Its proportions are very different from those of the correspond
ing chamber in the little temple of Khons, but yet it fills
the same office in the general conception, it is constructed on the
same principle and lighted in the same fashion. To use the
expression of Strabo, we have here a real pronaos or ante-temple,
because a passage, open to the sky, intervenes between it and that
part of the building which contains the sanctuary. The four
doorways ^ with which this vast hall is provided seem to indicate
that it was more accessible than the parts beyond the passage just mentioned.
We cannot pretend to determine the uses of all those chambers
which encumber with their ruins the further parts of the great
building. It is certain however that between them they constitute
the uaos, or temple properly speaking. They are surrounded by a double wall and there is but one door by which they can be
reached—precautions which suffice to prove the peculiarly sacred
character of this part of the whole rectangle. In which of these
chambers are we to find the a^]Kos 1 Was it, as the early observers
thought, in those granite apartments which are marked H on the
plan ? This locality was suggested by the extra solicitude as
to the strength and beauty of those chambers betrayed by the
use of a more beautiful and costly material upon them than upon
the rest of the temple. Moreover, the chamber (H) which is
situated upon the major axis of the temple bears a strong
resemblance in shape, as well as position, to the sanctuary of
the temple of Khons, in the case of which no doubt was possible.
Or must we follow Rlariette when he places the sanctuary in the
middle of the eastern court (I in plan) ? All traces of it have
now almost vanished, but Mariette based his opinion upon the
fact that in the ruins of this court alone are to be found any
traces of the old temple dating back to the days of the Amen
emhats and Ousourtesens of the twelfth dynasty. He does
not attempt to account, however, for those carefully built granite
apartments which seem to most visitors to be the real sanctuary,
or, at least, the sanctuary of the temple as reconstructed and
enlarged by the princes of the second Theban Empire.
^ Including a postern of comparatively small dimensions, there are five doorways to the hypostyle hall.

In the actual state of the ruins the doubts on this point are,
perhaps, irremovable. But the final determination of the question would be of no particular moment to our argument. For our
purposes it is sufficient to note that in the Great Temple, as in
the Temple of Khons, the sanctuary was surrounded and followed
by a considerable number of small apartments. In the Great Temple these chambers are very numerous and some of them
are large enough to require central supports for their ceilings in
the form of one or m^re columns. In other respects they are
similar to those in the TerhpJe of Khons.
Fig. 216. — Karnak as it is at present. The ruins of a pylon and of the hypostyle hall.
The resemblance between the two temples is completed by
the existence in both of a minor hypostyle hall behind the
sanctuary. The hall of four columns of the smaller building
corresponds to the large saloon called the Hall of Thothines,
in the Great Temple (J). The roof of this saloon is supported by twenty columns disposed in two rows and by square piers
standing free of the walls. It is 146 feet wide, and from 53 to
57 feet deep. Immediately before the granite apartments, and
vol.. I. X B

between the fifth and sixth pylons, another hall, also with
two ranges of columns but not so deep as the last, is introduced.
Its position shows it to be meant for a vestibule to the naos
properly speaking. The fine Coni't of tJic Caryatides with its
Osiride pillars, the first chamber entered by the visitors who
penetrate into the temple proper, seems to have been designed
for a similar purpose (G).
If we wish, then, to evolve some order out of the seeming chaos
ot Karnak ; if we wish to find among its ruins the essential
characteristics, the vital organs, if we may put it so, of the
Egyptian temple, we have only to apply the method of analysis
and reduction suggested by examination of simpler monuments,
and to take account of the long series of additions which resulted
in the finally stupendous dimensions of the whole mass.^ These
additions may be distinguished from one another by their scale
of proportions and by their methods of construction. When
rightly examined the gigantic ruins of the great temple of Amen •
betray those simple lines and arrangements, which form, as we
have shown, the original type.
The same remark may be applied to the other great building
on the left bank of the river, the Temple of Luxor. There,
too, the architecture is, to use the words of Champollion, the
" architecture of giants." From the first pylon to the innermost
recesses of the sanctuary the building measures about 850 feet.
No traveller can avoid being deeply impressed by the first sight
of its lofty colonnades, by its tall and finely proportioned pillars
rearing their majestic capitals among the palms and above the
huts of the modern village. These columns belong to the first
hypostyle hall, and, were they not buried for two-thirds of their
height, they would be, from the ground up to the base of their
capitals, rather more than 50 feet high ; the capitals and the
cubes above them measure about 18 feet more. The plan of Luxor is more simple than that of Karnak ; it
was built in two " heats " only, to borrow an expression from the

athletes, under Amenophis III. and Rameses II. In later periods it
underwent some insignificant re
touches, and that is all. It is
narrower than its grreat neisfhbour,
and covers a very much less space
of ground, neither has it so many chambers, and yet we are in some
respects more at a loss in attempt
ing to assign their proper uses to
its apartments and in finding some
equivalent for them in the elementary
type from which we started, than
we were in the larger temple.
It is true that the proper character
of the iiaos is better marked at Luxor
than elsewhere. The sanctuary may
be determined at a glance. It
consists of a rectanofular chamber
standing in the middle of a larcje
square hall ; it is the only chamber
in the whole building for which
granite has been used ; it has two
doors, one in each end, exactly upon
the major axis of the building. The
hall in which it is placed is preceded
by a vestibule, and surrounded by those small • chambers which are
always found in this part of a
temple. So far, then, there is
nothing to embarrass us ; every
thing is in conformity with the
principles which have been laid down.
The real difficulty begins when
we look round us for the pro
naos, and examine the hypostyle
halls. Here, as elsewhere,
there is a hall of modest dimen
sions beyond the sanctuary. It
•• •e



372 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
is supported by twelve columns. There is another, much wider
and deeper, in front of the naos ; it has thirty-two of those lofty
columns of which we have already spoken. By its design,
situation, and the spacing of its columns, it reminds us of the
hypostyle hall of Karnak. It differs from it in being open,
without any external wall towards the court ; so that it may be
called a portico with four ranges of columns. Moreover, again
unlike the Karnak hall, it is by no means the most imposing
feature of the whole edifice. The greatest elevation and the
most imposing proportions, so far as the interior of the building
is concerned, are to be found in the great gallery which leads
from the first to the second court, from the second to the third
pylon. This gallery is in effect a hypostyle hall, but it differs
profoundly from the superb edifice which bears that name at Karnak. It is long and narrow and looks more like a mere
covered corridor than an ample hall in which the eager crowd could find elbow-room.
The place occupied by this hall in the whole composition is
equally singular. It has been ascertained that the first pylon
and the peristylar courtyard behind it date from the time of
Rameses II., while all the rest of the building, from what is at
present the second pylon inwards, was built by Amenophis III.
The doorway in the second pylon leads immediately into the grand gallery, some 1 76 feet long, of which we have been
speaking.
We can hardly tell, therefore, where to look for the true
pronaos at Luxor. In that part of the ground plan where it
is generally found there is nothing but an open portico, which is
considerably lower than the highest parts of the building. The
great colonnade, again, is separated from the naos by an open
court, so that it ought, perhaps, to be classified as what the
Greeks called a propyla-um ; but yet it is a hall, inclosed and
covered, of great size and height, and richly decorated, like the
hypostyle halls which we have already described and others which
we have yet to notice.'
' In jiresence of this double range of superb columns one is tempted to look upon them as the beginning of a hypostyle liall which was never finished, to suppose that a great cential nave was constructed, and that, by force of circumstances unknown, the aisles were never begun, and that the builders contented themselves by inclosing and preserving their work as far as it had gone.

The Temple under the New Empire. 0/ .
Another peculiarity of Luxor is its cliange of axis. The first
pylon, that of Rameses, is not parallel with the two built by
Amenophis ; the angle at which they stand is a very perceptible
one. Neither is the doorway of this pylon in alignment with the
other doorways on the major axis of the building. No justification
or even explanation of this irregularity, which is unique among the
Theban temples, has been discovered.
If Ave cross the Nile and land upon the plain which stretches
between the river and the Libyan hills, we find ourselves in the
presence of those temples, the Ramesseum, Medinet-Abou, and
Gournah, whose funerary destination we have already noticed.
These are royal chapels erected in connection with the royal
tombs in their neighbourhood, they are cenotaphs filled with the
memories of the great Theban princes, and with representations
of their exploits. Consequently we do not find in them those
complications which, in the great temples of the right bank, mark
the successive dynasties to which their final form was due. But
yet the difference in general appearance is not great ; there is
however, one distinction which, as it goes far to prove the
peculiar character of these buildings, should be carefully noticed.
In no one of them, if we may judge from plans which have been
made, has any chamber or structure been found which corresponds
to the sanctuary or (njxos of the temples of Amen or Khons. The
absence of such a chamber might easily be explained by our
supposition that these buildings were funerary chapels ; as such
they would require no depository for those mysterious symbols
of this or that deity which the temples proper contained : they
were the lineal descendants of the upper chambers in the
mastabas, in which no rudiment of such a thing is to be found.
On the other hand, we have reason to believe that the great
Theban divinities were associated in the worship paid to deceased
kings. If that were so these funerary temples might well have
been arranged like those of the right bank. The inner portions
of the Ramesseum and of Medinet-Abou are so ruinous that the
question cannot be settled by the examination of their remains. The Ramesseum certainly appears to have been the monument
described by Diodorus as the Tomb of Osyiuandias, a name which
has never been satisfactorily explained.^ It is also called by the
Institut d Egyptc, the Palace of Memnon and the Memnonium,
' Diodorus, i. 47 49.



_^76 A History of Art in An'cient Egypt.
upon the faith of Strabo's identification of Isniandes and Memnon.^
It is to ChampolHon that this building owes the restoration of its
true title, under \vhich it is now generally known.
Without being so colossal as Karnak, the size of the Ramesseum would astonish us anywhere but in Egypt. When it was com
plete, it must have been as large as Luxor before the additions
of Rameses II. were made, if not larger. The first pylon
was 226 feet wide ; the whole of its upper part is destroyed.
^
Immediately behind this pylon comes a vast peristylar court,
almost square on plan (186 feet by 173). On the left the remains of a double colonnade e.xist, which must at one time
have extended along at least two sides of the quadrangle. At the
further end of this court and directly facing the back of the pylon,
was a colossal statue of Rameses. Although seated, this statue was more than 56 feet high ; its fragments now cover a con
siderable amount of the courtyard. A grand doorway, pierced
through the centre of the wall upon which the defeat of the
Khetas is painted, leads to a second court, a little less extensive
than the first. Right and left there are porticos, each with a
double range of columns. On the side of the entrance and on
that opposite to it there are single ranges of Osiride figures.
Many of these figures are still standing ; they are 31 feet high.
Three flights of steps lead up from this court into a vestibule
ornamented with two colossal busts of Rameses and with a row
of columns. From this vestibule the hypostyle hall is reached
by three doorways of black granite. It measures 136 feet wide
and 103 deep. Its roof is supported by forty-eight columns, in
eight ranges of six each, counting from front to rear. Five of these eight ranges are still standing and still afford support
to a part of the ceiling. This latter is painted with golden stars
1 Straeo, .xvii. i. 42. In another passage (xvii. i. 46) he seems to place the Memnonium close to the two famous colossi. He would, therefore, seem rather to have had in view an " Amenophium," the remains of which have been discovered in the immediate neighbourhood of the two colossi. The French snvaii/s suspected this to be the case, but they often defer to the opinions of their immediate predecessors among Egyptian travellers. [Description gencrale de Thebes, section iii.) 2 This pylon stands in the foreground of our view (Fig. 220). The face which
is here shown was formerly covered — as \ve may judge from the parts which remain —with pictures of battles ; and that we might not have to actually invent scenes of combat for our restoration, we have borrowed the ornamentation of the first pylon of the Temple of Khons. The scale of our cut is too small, however, to show any
details.

arrangement is the same ; there is in both a wide passage down
the centre, supported by columns thicker and higher than the
rest, from which they are also distinguished by the nobility of
their bell-shaped capitals. At Karnak the hall was begun by
' Lepsius, Deiikmakr, part i. plates 88 and 89. The engineers of the Iiistitut d'Egypte fell into an error in speaking of this hall. They failed to notice that it was smaller than the second court, and they accordingly gave it sixty columns.

Rameses I. and Seti ; Rameses II. did no more than carry on the work of his predecessors. He heard the chorus of admiration
with which the completion of such a superb building must have been hailed, and we can easily understand that he was thereby
incited to reproduce its happy arrangement and majestic propor
tions in the great temple which he was erecting in his own honour
on the left bank of the river.
Ambitious though he was, Rameses II. could not attempt to
give the colossal dimensions of the great temple of Amen to
what was, after all, no more than the chapel of his own tomb.
The great hall at Karnak required three reigns, two of them very
long ones, for its completion. In the Ramesseum an attempt was
made to compensate for inferior size by extra care in the details and by the beauty of the workmanship. The tall columns
of the central nave were no more than thirty-six feet high,
including base and capital, the others were only twenty-five feet ;
but they surpassed the pillars at Karnak by the elegance of
their proportions.
The admiration excited in us by the ruins of Karnak is mingled
with astonishment, almost with stupefaction, but at the Ramesseum we are more charmed although we are less surprised. We
see that, when complete, it must have had a larger share than its
rival of that beauty into which merely colossal dimensions do
not enter.^
Beyond the hall there are wide chambers, situated upon the
major axis of the building, and each with its roof supported by eight columns. Beyond them again there is a fourth and smaller
chamber which has only four columns. Round these rooms a
number of smaller ones are gathered ; they are all in a very fragmentary state, and among them no vestige of anything like a
secos has been found. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs in one
of the larQfer rooms seem to confirm the assertion of Diodorus,
in his description of the Toiiib of Osymandias, that the library
was placed in this part of the building.'^ The Ramesseum was formerly surrounded by brick structures
of a peculiar character, some of which are yet to be found in good preservation at about 50 metres from the north face of the
building. They consist of a double range of vaults closely

abutting- on each other, numbering- from ten to twelve in each
range, and surmounted by a platform. If it be true that a library
was included in the building, these curious structures, which are
situated within the outer bounding wall of the temple, may have
contained rooms for lodging and instructing students, as well as
chambers for the priests. In that case Rameses would deserve
the credit of having founded, like the Mussulman sovereigns, a
)iit-d}'css(-\ or sort of university, by the
side of his tiirbch and inosquc. Additional
probability is given to this conjecture
both by certain discoveries which have been made in tombs near the Ramesseum
and by the evidence of several papyri.^
But for these texts we should be inclined
to believe that these remains are the
ruins of storehouses.
About a thousand yards south-west of
the Ramesseum rises the group of buildings which is known by the name of the modern village of Medinet-Abou.
It was not until the second half of the
present century had commenced that
they were cleared from the debris and
modern huts which concealed many of their parts. The group is composed of
three distinct buildings in one enclosure.
The oldest is a temple built by
Thothmes II. and Thothmes III. and afterwards enlarged by the Ptolemies and the Roman Emperors (A on
plan). The other two date from the
time of Rameses III., the founder of the twentieth dynasty.
They both lie upon the same axis, they are connected by a sphinx
avenue, and they must certainly be considered as two parts of one
whole. The first of the three which we encounter in approaching
the group from the river is known as the Royal Pavilion or
Pavilion of Rameses III. (B). Ninety yards farther to the north
we come upon the great temple, the funerary character of which we
have already explained (C). It is a second Rauicsscuni, and to avoid

confusion it is generally known as the Great Temple ofMedinet-Abou.
We shall return to the Royal Pavilion presently, and, as for the
Temple of Thothmes, which was consecrated to Amen, its really
ancient portion is of too little importance to detain us long. It
consists merely of an isolated sccos surrounded on three sides by
an open gallery upheld by square piers and, upon the fourth, by
a block containing six small chambers (Fig. 222).
The great temple, however, whose picturesque ruins attract every
visitor to Thebes, deserves to be
carefully considered even in our
summary review.^ It bears a striking resemblance to the Ramesseum. Their dimensions are
nearly the same. The first pylon at Medinet-Abou is 210 feet
wide. The two courts which follow
and isolate the second pylon are
severally i t 3 feet by 140, and 126
feet by 136. The plan of Me
dinet-Abou does not differ (223) in
any very important points from that of the Ramesseum. Upon
two of its sides only, those which
are at right angles to the face of
the pylon, the first quadrangle
has colonnades. One of these
colonnades, that on the right
of a visitor entering the temple,
consists of a row of pillars faced
with caryatides of Osiris. These
Osiride piers are repeated in
the second court, where a double
colonnade, five steps above the pavement, leads to the pronaos.
The latter seems too small for the two peristyles. It has only
twenty-four supporting columns, in four rows of si.x each, counting

ing. Ranges of apartments are introduced between it and the
external walls of the temple.
Was there a sanctuary behind this hypostyle hall ? It would
seem rather, according to the recent investigations of INIariette,
that upon the major axis of the temple there were two small halls,
each supported by eight columns, like those in the Ramesseum ; around these many small chambers would be grouped in the
fashion which is almost universal in this part of an Egyptian
religious building. The little that can be discovered as to this
point has its importance in establishing a comparison between the
temple of Rameses II. and that of Rameses III., because it
mio-ht prove that the similarity, which we have mentioned as
existing between the more public parts of the two edifices,
extended to the sanctuary and its dependencies in the rear. The last of the great Theban Pharaohs certainly drew much of
his inspiration from the work of his illustrious predecessors. In
their present state of mutilation it is impossible to decide which
was the finer of the two in their complete state. To the fine
hypostyle hall of the Ramesseum, Medinet-Abou could oppose the
Royal Pavilion which rose in front of the temple and grouped
itself so happily with the first pylon, affording one of the most
effective compositions in the whole range of Egyptian architecture. The rest of the temples in this neighbourhood and within the
enclosures at Karnak are all more or less intimately allied to the
type we have established, and need not be noticed in detail.^
We have good reason to believe that the type of temple which
we have described was a common one in other parts of Egypt than Thebes. The temples of Memphis, of Heliopolis and of
the Delta cities, have perished and, practically, left no trace
behind ; but the great buildings constructed by the Theban con
querors outside the limits of Egypt proper, in Nubia, are in
comparatively good preservation. One of these, the Temple
o(: So/c/>, built by Thothmes III. and reconstructed by Amenophis III., must have borne a strong resemblance to the Ramesseum, so far as can be judged through the discrepan
cies in the available plans of the first-named building. Cailliaud
only allows it one peristylar court, while Hoskins and Lepsius
1 A few of these buildings— that, for instance, on the right of the great lake

seem to have been very peculiar in arrangement, but their remains are in such a state of confusion that it is at present impossible to describe their plans.



The Temple under the New Empire. ;8;

give it two. According to Cailliaud, its hypostj-le hall, which must
have been a very beautiful one, contained forty-eight columns.
After it came another hall, with a roof supported by twelve columns. This was surrounded by small chambers, the remains
of which are very confused. In the plan given by Lepsius there are two h}post\le halls with a wall between them, an arrangement which
is also found at Abydos. The outer one nuist have had twenty
four columns, the largest in the building, and the second forty, of
rather less diameter ; the remainder of the temple has disappeared.^ We find analogous arrangements in the great temple of Napata
(Gebel-Barkal). Built by Amenophis III. when Napata was the
seat of an Egyptian pro-consul, and repaired by Tahraka when
Ethiopia became supreme over Egypt, this temple resembles the
Theban buildings in its plan. From a peristylar court enclosed
between two pylons, we pass into a hypostylar hall containing
forty-six columns ; behind this hall comes the sanctuary, in its
usual position, with its cjitoiiragc of small chambers. We may
call this the classic type of Egypt.
The tem.ples which we have hitherto examined are chiefly
remarkable for the simplicity of their plan. A single sanctuary
forms the centre and, so to speak, the heart of the whole
composition. Pjlons, peristylar courts and hypostylar halls, are
but anterooms and vestibules to this all important chamber;
while the small apartments which surround it afford the necessar)
accommodation for the material adjuncts of Egyptian worship. In
the great temple at Karnak, the anterior and posterior
dependencies are developed to an extraordinary extent, but
this development is always in the direction of the length, or to
speak more accurately, of the depth of the building. The smaller
faces of the whole rectangle are continuallv carried farther from

The plan given by Hoskins agrees more with that of Lepsius than with Cailliaud, but it only shows the beginning of the first hypostyle hall and nothing of the second. These divergences are easily understood when it is remembered that nothing but some ten columns of two different types remain in situ, and that the mounds of dl'bris are high and wide. In order to obtain a really trustwovtliy plan, this accumulation would have to be cleared away over the whole area of the temple. All tlie pjlans show a kind of gallery, formed of six columns, in front of the first pylon : it reminds us in some degree of the great corridor at Luxor ; by its general form, however, rather than its situation.

each other by the additions of fresh chambers and architectural
features, which are distributed, \vith more or less regular
alternation, on the right and left of the major axis \Yhich always
passes through the centre of the scros. The building, therefore,
in spite of many successive additions always contrives to preserve
the unity of its organic constitution.
But all the great buildings in Egypt which were constructed for
the service of religion were not so simply designed. A good
instance of a more complex arrangement is to be found in the great temple at Abydos (Fig. 224). It was begun by Seti I. and
finished by Rameses II. Mariette freed it from the cfcbris and
modern hovels which encumbered it, and, thanks to his efforts,
there are now few monuments in Egypt whose inner arrangements
can be more clearly and certainly perceived.
Its general shape is singular. The courts and the pronaos
compose a narrow and elongated rectangle, with which the parts
corresponding to the sanctuary and its dependent chambers
form a right angle (see Fig. 224). This salient wing has no corresponding excrescence on the other side. We might consider
the building unfinished, but that there is no sign whatever that
the architect meant to .complete it with another wing at the
opposite angle. The Egyptians were never greatly enamoured of that exact symmetry which has become one of the first artistic
necessities of our time.
Still more surprising than the eccentricity of its plan, are the
peculiar arrangements which are to be found in the interior of this temple. As at Medinet-Abou and the Ramesseum, there are two courts, each preceded by a pylon. After these comes
the pronaos. The courts differ from those at Thebes in having
no peristyles or colonnades. The only thing of the kind is a row
of square pillars standing before the inner wall of the second court
(see plan). This is a poor equivalent for the majestic colonnades
and files of caryatides which we have hitherto encountered.
The suppression of the portico has a great effect upon the
appearance of these two courts. It deprives them of the rich
shadows cast by the long colonnades and their roofs of the
Theban temples, and the long walls must have seemed rather cold
and monotonous in spite of the bas-reliefs and paintings which
covered them. Their absence, however, is not allowed to aftect
the eeneral lines of the olan.

We have given neither an elevation nor a section of the temple at Abydos, because neither the one nor the other was to be had. The building was hardly known until Mariette freed it from the debris with nhich it was engulphed. He, too, studied rather as an egyptologist than as an architect, and was content with making known its internal arrangements by a plan. This plan does not appear to be minutely exact. A little farther on we shall have to speak of a peculiarity which exists at Abydos, but which is not hinted at in the adjoining plan ; some of the columns are coupled in the first hypo
style hall. We take this fact from the Description, where the measurements are given in a fashion which forbids all doubt of their fidelity.

The Temple under the New Empire. 389
It is when we arrive at the pronaos that we fail to recognize
the disposition to which we have grown accustomed. There is
no central nave, with its columns of extra size and more careful
design, leading to the closed door of the sanctuary. There are
two hypostyle halls, the first supported by twenty-four, the second
by thirty-six columns. They are separated by a wall pierced with
seven doorways, each doorway corresponding to one of the aisles
between the columns. In the farther wall of the second of these
halls, there are seven more doorways, corresponding to the last named, and opening upon seven oblong vaulted saloons, all of one
size and completely isolated one from another.
By their situation on the plan, by their form, and by the
decoration of their walls, these vaulted chambers declare
themselves to be so many sanctuaries. Each one of them is
dedicated to some particular deity, whose name and image appear
in the decorations of the chamber itself and also upon the lintel
of the door outside. These names and images are again repeated
upon all the surfaces presented bj' the aisle which leads up to
the door.
The seven deities thus honoured, beoinninir at the riirht. are
Horus, Isis, Osiris, Amen, Harmachis, Ptah, and Seti himself,
whom we thus find assimilated with the greatest of the Egyptian
gods. Each chamber contains a collection of thirty-six pictures,
which are repeated from one to another with no changes beyond
those rendered necessary by tlie substitution of one god for
another. These pictures deal with the rites which w'ould be
celebrated by the king in each of the seven sanctuaries.
Behind this septuple sanctuary there is a secondary hypostjle
hall, just as we find it behind the single scros of the ordinary
temple. Its roof was supported by ten columns, and access to it
was obtained through the third sanctuar)-, that of Osiris. This
part of the temple is in a very fragmentary condition. Very little
is left of the bounding walls, but it has been ascertained that
.several of these chambers were dedicated to one or other of the
deities between whom the naos was apportioned. Thus one of the
chambers referred to was placed under the protection of Osiris, another under that of Horus, and a third under that of Isis.
The decoration of the southern wing of the temple seems
never to have been completed. It contains a long corridor,
a rectangular court with an unfinished peristyle, several small

chambers wiih columns, and a flight of steps leading up on to
the flat roof. A dark apartment or crypt, divided into two stories
by a floor of large stone slabs, may have been used as a storehouse.
These farthest apartments seem to have been arranged in no
sort of order. We shall not here enter into such matters as
the construction of the seven parallel vaults in the naos ; for that
a future opportunity will be found ; ^ at present our business is to

make the differences between the temple at Abydos and that of
Khons and its congeners, clearly understood. The distinction lies
in the seven longitudinal subdivisions, beginning with the seven
doors in the facade of the hypostyle hall, and ending in the vaulted chambers which form the same number of sanctuaries.
Seen from outside, the temple would not betray its want of unity ;

The Temple under the New Empire. 391
it was surrounded by a single wall, the complex naos was prefaced
by courts and pylons in the same fashion as in the temples of
Thebes which we have already noticed, and it would not be until
the building was entered and explored that the fact would become
evident that it was seven shrines in one, seven independent
temples under one roof^ At Thebes also we find a temple which, by its internal
arrangements, resembles that of Abydos. It is called sometimes the Palace and sometimes the Temple of Gournah ; in the
inscriptions it is called the House of Sell. Two propylons, one
about fifty yards in front of the other, form an outwork to the main building, with which they are connected by an avenue of
sphinxes. It is probable that they were originally the doorways
through brick walls, now demolished, which formed successive
enclosures round the temple. The dromos led up to the pronaos,
which was reached by a tew steps. The front of the naos is a
portico of simple design, consisting of ten columns between two
square pilasters, the whole being 166 feet long by 10 feet
deep. Eight of these fine columns are still erect. The wall at
the back of the portico is pierced by three doorways, to which
three distinct compartments or divisions of the interior correspond
(see plan. Fig. 226).
The only feature in which these compartments resemble one
another is their independence. They are isolated from one
, another by walls which run from front to back of the naos. The
most important and elaborate of the three compartments is the
middle one. Its entrance doorway opens directly upon a hall
which is the largest in the whole temple. It is eighteen metres
long, its roof is supported by six columns similar to those of the
portico already mentioned, and ranged around it are nine sm.all
chambers, the pictures in which illustrate the apotheosis of
Seti, who, often indued with the attributes of Osiris, is sometimes
shown doing homage to the Theban triad of gods, and more
especially to Amen-Ra, sometimes as himself the object of
worship. The central one of these chambers opens upon a
hall where the roof is supported by four square pillars, and upon
this hall again four small apartments open. These can hardly be
mere storehouses, but they have suffered so greatly that no certain

The Temple under the New Empire. 395
The great temples of Abydos and Gournah were built by the
same sovereigns, Seti I. and Rameses II. Perhaps, too, their
plans were traced by the same architect. The resemblance between them is so great that they may be looked upon as
variants of one type, of a type which is distinguished by the
juxtaposition of similar parts grouped laterally one by the side
of the other. Each of the chapels which we have described was
self contained, the subsidiary chambers which were required for the routine of worship were grouped round it, either on one side,
as at Abydos, or in the angles of the sanctuary itself, as at
Gournah. With such slight differences of detail as this, the two
buildings were built upon the same principle. At Gournah the
division is tripartite, and the three compartments vary in their
arrangements ; at Abydos they are seven in number, and exactly
similar in design. A temple thus cut into three parts, or seven,
reminds us of the seed-pods of certain plants, in which the
fertilizinfj Q-rain is divided between several cells. But whether
these are numerous or few, the naos never has any great depth.
It seems as if the absence of a true orfjanic centre arrested the
development of the building ; we find no signs of an edifice
which, like the temple of Amen at Karnak, might be developed
almost to infinity without losing its unity.
On the other hand, there were a few temples in which a severe
and extreme unity was the distinguishing characteristic. In Upper
Egypt and Nubia a few examples of the class are still to be seen.
As a rule they date from the eighteenth dynasty, but there were a
few temples of the same kind erected under the Ptolemies.^ It
seems probable, therefore, that they were common to all the
periods of Egyptian history, and to the conquered provinces, as
well as to Egypt proper. They were erected within, and in the
neighbourhood of, those cities whose importance was not sufficient to demand such great monumental works as the temples of Thebes or Abydos, of Memphis or Sais. We might call them chapels,
raised either to the honour of the local deities, or for the purpose
oi commemorating the passage of some conquering prince and

the homage paid by him to the deity to whom he looked for
protection and victory.
In these chapels there are neither internal peristyles nor hypo
styles ; there are none of those subsidiary chambers among which
it is sometimes so easy to lose our way. There is, in fact, nothing
but a rectangular chamber and a portico about it, and, in most
cases, it would appear that a short dromos, consisting of a few
pairs of sphinxes, lent dignity to the approach.
The best proportioned and perhaps the most interesting building
of this class is the little sandstone temple built by Amenophis III.
at Elephantine, upon the southern frontier of Egypt. It was dis
covered at the end of the last century by the draughtsmen of the French Expedition, and named by them the Temple of the South}
This little buildino- no loncrer exists. It was
destroyed in 1822 by the Turkish Governor of Assouan, who had a mania for building. Happily
the jalans and drawings, which we reproduce,
seem to have been made with great care.
The total area of the temple, at the floor
level of the cella, was 40 feet by 31. It was
raised upon a well-built rectangular base of
almost the same lateral dimensions,- and 7 feet
6 inches high to the pavement of the portico.
From the earth level to the top of the cornice
the temple was 21 feet 6 inches in height. A
flight of steps, enclosed between two walls of the
same height as the stylobate, led up to the portico. The portico
itself was composed of square piers and round columns. Two of
the latter were introduced in the centre of each of the smaller faces
of the building, while the side galleries were enclosed by seven
square piers, inclusive of those at the angles. A dwarf wall about
three feet in height bounded the gallery on the outside, and
afforded a base for the piers ; the circular columns on each side
of the entrance alone stood directly upon the pavement of the
gallery, and were thus higher by about three feet than either the
piers or the columns in the corresponding facade at the rear. The
oblong chamber enclosed by this portico had two entrances, one at

the top of the steps, the other at the back.^ The first named was
indicated as the true entrance to the building by the shght salience
of its jambs and lintel, by the increased size of the columns in front
of it, and by its position with regard to the steps.
One more peculiarity must be noticed. Neither in piers nor in
walls do we find that inward slope which is almost universal in
Egyptian exteriors. The lines are vertical and horizontal. This
is not the effect of caprice ; the architect had a good reason for
neglecting the traditions of his profession. By avoiding the usual
inclination towards the centre, he gave to his small creation a
dignity which it would otherwise have missed, and, in some
degree, concealed its diminutive size.

In spite of its modest dimensions, this temple was without
neither beauty nor grandeur. Its stylobate raised it well above

Jomard (pi. 35, Fig. i) has imported a small chamber into his plan, placing it behind the large hall as a sort of opisthodomos ; but he bids us remark that it was constructed of different materials, and in a different bond, from the rest of the temple. It showed no trace of the sculptured decoration which covered all the rest of the temple. This chamber was therefore a later addition, and one only obtained at the expense of the continuous portico, the back part of which was enclosed with a wall in which the columns became engaged. According to Jomard, this alteration dates from the Roman period, but however that maybe, in our examination of the temple we may disregard an addition which appears to have been so awkwardly inanaged.

the plain, while the steps in front gave meaning and accent to its
elevation. The wide spacing of the columns in front allowed the
richly decorated doorway to be seen in effective grouping with the
long perspectives of the side galleries. The piers on the flanks
were more closely spaced than the columns of the faradc, and the
contrast was heightened by the simplicity of their form. The
dignity of the entablature and the bold projection of the cornice
added to the effect of the whole, and emphasized the well-balanced
nature of the composition. The Egyptian architects never pro
duced a building better calculated to please modern tastes. Its
symmetry and just proportion appeal directly to those whose
artistic ideas are founded upon the creations of the Greeks and Romans.

This sympathy was conspicuously felt by those who discovered
the little monument. " The arrangement," saj's Jomard, " is a
model of simplicity and purity. . . . The Temple of Ele
phantine is pleasing as a whole, and commands our attention."
But the purity and harmony of its lines are not its only claims to
our admiration. The pleasure which it causes us to feel is partly the result of its resemblance to a well-known and much admired
type, that of the Greek temple. In all essentials the arrangements
are the same, a cella raised upon an important base and surrounded by a colonnade.
The general arrangement of the Elephantine structure has even
its name in the technical language of the Greek architects, they
would call it a peripteral temple, because the colonnade goes completely round it. Nowhere else do we find such a striking resemblance between Greece and Egypt. But for the mouldings,



The Temple under the New Empire. 399
the sculptured decorations, and the inscribed texts, we should be
tempted to see in it a building of the Ptolemaic period, Greek in
conception and plan, but decorated in the Egyptian taste. Such
a mistake would, however, be impossible in these days, and even
at the end of the last century. The French savanis knew enough
to prevent them falling into such an error. They were unable to
read the hieroglyphics, but the general physiognomy of the
building told them that it could boast of a venerable antiquity.
In coming to this conclusion they were right, but they should
have stopped there instead of attempting to establish a direct
connection, as cause and effect, between the Egyptian building and
the temples of Greece. We shall not here discuss the delicate
question of the indebtedness of Greek artists to those of Egypt,
but we may allow ourselves to make two observations. In the
first place, the temples built upon this plan were very small, and
must have attracted very little notice indeed from strangers dazzled by the wonders of Sais, Memphis, and Thebes ; and the
buildings in those great cities did not offer the peculiar charac
teristics which, we are asked to believe, inspired the early Greek
architects. In the second place, if there had been any direct
imitation of an Egyptian model, we should have found in the
copy at least some passing trace of those square piers which were
so continually and successfully used by the Egyptian architects ;
but in the Greek peripteral temples the external colonnades
are always made up exclusively of circular columns. The Greek
architect hardly ever made use of the square pier, excejat
in the form of a pilaster, to give strength to the extremities
of a wall.
Would it not be much simpler to admit that we have here one
of those coincidences which are so frequent in the history of the
arts ? Human nature is pretty much the same all over the world.
When human skill has been employed at different times and in
different countries, in supplying similar wants and solving almost
identical problems, it has been led to results which vary only in
the minor details. These variations are more or less marked
accordin^r to race characteristics or material surroundincjs. When
examined closely the circumstances of mankind are never found
unchanged from one period or one race to another, but a superficial
resemblance is enough to ensure that their artistic creations shall
have many important points in common. In no pursuit does



400 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
the human mind turn in a narrower circle than in architecture. The
purpose of the building on the one hand, and the qualities of the
material on the other, exercise a great intluence upon form. But
the purposes for which important buildings are erected are very
few, neither are the materials at the command of the architect
very many. The possible combinations are therefore far from
numerous. Take two races placed in conditions of climate and
civilization which may fairly be called analogous ; put the same
materials in the hands of their architects and give them the same
programme to carry out ; is it not almost certain that they would produce works with many features in common, and that without
any knowledge of each other's work ? From this point of view
only, as it seems to us, should the type of building just described
be regarded. If the temple at Elephantine had possessed no other
interest but that belonging to it as an example of Egyptian
temple building, we might have omitted all mention of it, or at
least devoted but a few words to it. And yet such types are
scarce. The French explorers found a second temple of the same
class not far from the first ; now, however, it exists only in
their drawings.^ A third has been discovered in Nubia, which
must resemble the two at Elephantine very strongly ; we mean
the temple constructed by Thothmes III. on the left bank of the
river, at Semneh. Although it has suffered greatly, traces of a
portico are to be found about the cella, and it has been ascertained
that this portico consisted both of square piers and columns."^
Finally, at El-kab (Eilithya), in Upper Egypt, there is a temple
constructed upon the same plan ; it differs from that at Elephantine
in having only two circular columns, those upon the facade ; all the
rest of the peristyle consists of square piers. ^ The oldest part of the temple built by Thothmes II. and Thothmes III. at Medinet
Abou presents an analogous arrangement. The sanctuary is there
surrounded on three sides by a portico of square piers (Fig. 222).
There is nothing to forbid the supposition that these temples
were once much more numerous in the valley of the Nile, but it
' In the Description de I'Egypte it is called Tlie Northern Temple (see vol. i. pi. 38, Figs. 2 and 3). The only difference noted by Jomard was in the ornamentation
of the capitals. - Lepsius Denknitcler, part i. pi. 113.

This temple is 50 feet long, 31 wide, and 15 feet 8 inches high.



The Temple under the New Empire. 401
appears certain that they were always of small dimensions. It like
those of Sais and Memphis, the temples of Thebes had vanished
and left no trace behind, we might have been led to believe that
some of the great religious buildings of the Egyptians had been in this form ; but we have Luxor and Karnak, Medinet-Abou and the Ramesseum, Gournah and Abydos ; we have several important
temples built in Ethiopia by Egyptian conquerors, and others erected
by the Ethiopian sovereigns in imitation of Egyptian architecture.^
When we compare these remains with one another and call to
mind the words of Strabo and of other ancient travellers as to
the monuments which have been destroyed, we are forced to
this gr-eneral conclusion, that it was
within the high external walls of their
buildings, around courts open to the
sky or as supports for wide and lofty
halls, that the Egyptians loved to
group their mighty piers and columns.
When the^ portico was outside it was
so placed because there was no room
for it within. When the temple was
reduced to a single narrow chamber,
so small that there was no room
for columns and that the walls could
support the roof without help, the
colonnade was relegated to the ex
terior, where it served to give im
portance to the cella, and to clothe
and beautify it.
The peripteral arrangement, which

IS a constant prmciple m
Greek architecture, is no more than a rare accident in that of
Egypt. But in spite of this difference the similarity, which might
be called a chance likeness, if the word chance had any place in
history, is full of interest for the historian of art.
The following facts are sufficient to prove that it was the small
size of these peripteral temples that first suggested the external
situation of their colonnades. As long as the cella was large
enough to admit supports of the ordinary diameter without encum
bering the space or destroying its proportions, we find the columns

inside. Of this the temple of Amenophis III. at Eilithyia, a
plan and section of which we take from Lepsius (Figs. 232 and
233),^ is an instance. It is prefaced by a chamber, very ruinous,
and wider than it is deep. It is now difficult to say whether this
was an uncovered court or a hypostyle hall.- Immediately abut
ting upon it comes the naos, a rectangular chamber measuring
internally 28 feet by 22 feet 6 inches. The roof might very pos
sibly have been supported by the four columns, as their bases
were 4 feet in diameter. A niche contrived in the further wall
of the naos acted the part of a secos.
Here too we find a very simple form of temple, but the naos
beine laree enough to admit, and even to demand, the use of
internal columns, it never entered the architect's head to surround
it with a portico externally. Thus arranged, the chapel, as we
have called these buildings, was nothing more than an epitome of
the temple, and there is no need for insistance upon the variations
which it presents upon a single theme, upon a first principle which
sometimes was developed into a colossal structure lilce that at
Karnak, sometimes reduced until it resulted in buildings where a
few paces carry the visitor from one extremity to the other.
We may say the same of those subterranean temples which
are called speos or hcmi-speos, grotto, or half-grotto, according to
whether they are entirely rock cut, or prefaced by architectural
constructions. They are chiefly found in Lower Nubia, a fact
which has sometimes been explained by the natural configuration
of the soil. In that portion of the Nile Valley the river is
embraced so closely by the rocks between which it flows that it
would, we are told, have been difficult to find a site for a con
structed temple. In this, however, there is some exaggeration. If we examine a map of Nubia we shall find many places where
either one or the other of the two chains of hills fall back from
the river far enough to allow a considerable intervening fringe of
level ground. This is cropped and tilled by little groups of
natives, who live, as a rule, at the mouth of those wadis, or dry
torrent beds, which intersect the mountains. These strips of

Almost the same arrangements are to be found in the Temple oi Sedeiiiga. (Lepsius, Denkmirlef, parti, pi. 115.)

arable land are always either level or of a very gentle slope. It
would, therefore, not be very difficult to obtain a site for such little
oratories as were required lor the scanty population, for the soldiers
in the nearest military post, for the engineers and workmen in some
neighbouring quarry. Even supposing that it pleased the king to
choose some deserted site in a conquered province for the erection
of some durable memorial of his prowess, no very large building
would be required. Great temples were reserved for populous
cities, in which the kincj, the militarv commanders, and the
priests resided, in which the popular ceremonies of religion were
performed.
The Egyptian architect did not hesitate to cut awa\- part of the
side of a mountain when it was the only means open to him of
obtainino; a level site for buildintr. In this fashion Seti obtained
a site for his great temple at Abydos. The same thing might
have been done, at much less cost, for these little Nubian temples.

It would always have been easy with pick and chisel to adapt
some ridge or cornice of the clifts for their reception, or to cut a
sort of courtyard in the slope of the hill, in which a small temple
might have been erected. We must not seek, then, for a reason
for the multiplication of these rock temples In the Nubian section
of the Nile Valley either in natural conditions or in the want
of architectural resource. Even in Egypt proper there are
chapels cut in the flanks of the hills ; near Beni- Hassan there is
the Speos Arteuiidos, and near Assouan, close to the quarries of
Gebel Silsilis,^ there is another. Below the first cataract, how
ever, these grottos are as rare as they are numerous on the
other side of the frontier, where, indeed, they sometimes rise to
a magnificence of which nothing else in Egypt, unless it be the
finest of the sepulchral excavations at Thebes, can give an idea.
How are we to account for this difterence, or rather contrast ?
^ See, for Gebel Silsilis. Lepsius, Dcnkmalcr, part i. pi. 102.



404 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
This question is more easily asked than answered. The
following explanation seems to us, however, the most probable. Ethiopia was not Egypt. Although they were closely connected
as early as the sixth dynasty, the former never lost its character
of a conquered province. In Ethiopia men did not feel so sure
of the morrow as in Egypt proper. Between the sixth and the eleventh dynasty the hold of Egypt upon Ethiopia had been lost
at least once. Reconquered by the kings of the first Theban
period, it regained its independence during the domination of
the Hyksos ; the eighteenth dynasty had, therefore, to begin the
work of subjugation all over again, and it did its work more
thoroughly than any of its predecessors. Then, when the
Egyptian sceptre ruled as far south as Napata and the great
bend of the Nile, the governors of the southern provinces must
have been continually employed in repelling the incursions of the
negroes from Upper Ethiopia, and in suppressing the warlike
tribes who lived within the conquered frontier. At such times
the king himself must often have been compelled to take the field
and lead his armies in person. A constructed temple, especially
when of small size, would be in great risk of destruction in a
country exposed to the repeated incursions of savage tribes ;
columns and piers would soon be overturned by their ruthless
arms. But chambers cut in the living rock would offer a much
stouter resistance ; the decorations might be scraped down or
daubed Over, but the time and patience required for any serious
attack upon the limestone or granite sides and piers would not be
forthcoming. Such damage as could be done in a short time and by the weapons of the invaders could readily be repaired when
the raid was over.
We think it probable, therefore, that subterranean architecture
was preferred throughout this region because the political con
dition of the province was always more or less precarious, rather
than because the configuration of the country required it. Where
security was assured by the presence of a strong and permanent
garrison, as at Semneh and Kumneh, we find constructed temples
just as we do in Egypt. They are found, too, in those localities
•— Soleb and Napata for instance—where there was a large urban
population, and therefore fortifications and troops for their defence.
Everywhere else it was found more convenient to confide the temple
to the guardiansliip of its own materials, the living rock, and to bury



The Templp: under the New Empire. 405
it in faces of the cliffs. This kind of work, moreover, was per
fectly easy to Egyptian workmen. For many centuries they had
been accustomed, as we have seen, to hollow out the flanks of
their mountains, and to decorate the chambers thus obtained, for
the last resting-places of their dead. In the execution of such
works they must have arrived at a degree of practised skill which
made it as easy for them to cut a speos like the great temple at
Ipsamboul, as to build one of the same size. This fact probably
had its wxMght in leading the conquerors of Nubia to fill it with
underground temples. Such a method of construction was at once expeditious and durable, a double advantage, which would
be greatly appreciated in the early years of the occupation of
the province. When security was established, the same process
continued to be used from love for the art itself. When
Rameses II. cut those two caves in the rock at Ipsamboul, whose
facades, with their gigantic figures, have such an eft'ect upon the
travellers of to-day, it was neither because he was pressed tor
time, nor because he was doubtful of the tenure of his power.
The military supremacy of Eg\pt and the security of her conquests seemed to be assured. The Egyptian monarch carved
the cliffs of Ipsamboul into gigantic images of himself because he
wished to astonish his contemporaries and their posterity with the
boldness and novelty of the enterprise. At Thebes he had built,
on the right hand of the river, the hall of Karnak and the pylons
of Luxor ; on the leit bank, the Temple of Seti and the Ramesseum. For these he could have imagined no pendant more original or more imposing than the great temple carved from a natural hill,
in front of which statues of the sovereign, higher than any of
those which adorned the courtyards at Thebes, would see countless
generations of Egyptians pass before their feet in their journeys
up and down the Nile. The hypostyle hall at Karnak was a
marvel of constructed architecture, the great temple at Ipsamboul
was the masterpiece of that art which had been so popular with
the Egyptians from the earliest periods of their civilization, the art
which imitated the forms of a stone building by excavations in the
living rock.
Subterranean architecture had, of course, to go through a
regular course of development before it w'as capable of such
works as the tomb of Seti, at Thebes, and the temples of Ipsam
boul. In the necropolis of Memphis, and in that of the First



4o6 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Theban Empire, its ambition was more easily satisfied. So, too,
the first rock-cut temples were of very modest dimensions They
date from the eighteenth dynasty. Two of them are to be found
in the neighbourhood of Ipsamboul but on the other side of the
river, one near the castle of Addeh, the other at Feraig. The latter was cut by the king Harmhabi (or Armais) It is composed

as also is that of Addeh —of a hall supported by four columns,
two lateral chambers, and a sanctuary. There is an equally small
speos in Egypt which dates from the same period ; it is the grotto
at Beni-Hassan, which, ever since antique times, has been known
as the Speos Ar'temidos. The goddess Sekhet, to which it was
consecrated, had been identified with the Greek Artemis. It was begun by Thothmes III., carried on by Seti I., and seems never
to have been finished. The temple proper is prefaced by a kind

is known to us, namely, that which is cut in the flanks of the
Gebel-Barkal at Napata.' It is called the Typlwniinn, on account
of the grimacing figures which stand before
the piers. It dates from the time of Tahrak ,
and was one of the works with which the
famous Ethiopian decorated his capital in the
hope that it might become a formidable rival
to those great Egyptian cities which he
had taken and occupied.'- All the other rock

were about twenty-six feet high. Next, and at a slightly higher
level, came a hypostyle hall ; its roof was supported by twelve
square piers, those forming the
central avenue being of caryatid
form and higher than the others.
The subterranean part of the temple
begins with a passage cut in the
rock on the further side of this hall.
This passage leads to a long trans
verse vestibule, from which open
two lateral chambers, and three
from its further side. The furthest
chamber on the major axis of the
whole building was the sanctuary.
This is proved by its position, its
shape, and the niche which is cut
in its further wall. Four deities
are sculptured in this niche, and in
spite of the ill-usage to which they
have been subjected, one of them
can still be identified as Ptah, the
chief god of the temple.' We find almost the same
arrangements in the hemispeos of

(Figs. 240 and 241) is more
simple. There are neither dromos
nor pylon, properly speaking, and
only four caryatid pillars ; but

hypostyle hall and a sanctuary cut in the rock. At the back of
This description has been mainly taken from the plate given by Prisse {Hisfoire de I'Art Egyptieii, vol. i.). There are discrepancies, however, between it and both the inscription of Isambert and the plan of Horeau {Panorama d'Egypte et Ntibie), discrepancies which may probably be referred to the bad condition of the structural part of the building. According to Prisse's measurements the dromos, from its commencement to the foot of the first pylon, was about fifty-five yards long, and the rest of the temple, to the back of the niche, was about as much again. The rock-cut part was only about ten yards deep. = The resemblance between Prisse's plan of Gherf-Hossein and Horeau's plan of Wadi-Asseboua is so great as to suggest that one of the two writers may have made a mistake.

the sanctuary there is a stone bench upon which three statues
were seated. The two temples of Ipsamboul are so well known and have
been so often illustrated and described, that they need not detain
us long. The chief thing to be noticed here is that they are
without any external and constructed part, and that from their

position, high above the river and close to it, it was impossible that they could have any dromos ; and yet between the doorway
of the speos and the river bank there were steps which are now
either worn away by the action of the floods or hidden by the
debris from the cliffs. The facades of these temples were, however,
as richly decorated and as monumental in their way as those of
the most sumptuous buildings in Thebes.

The prototype of these facades is the Theban pylon. They
have the same trapeziform surfaces covered with figures and
inscriptions, circumscribed by a moulding and crowned by a
cornice in bold relief; they are inclined from the perpendicular,
and they afford a background to the statues of the king

410 A History of Art ix Ancient Egypt.
who caused them to be made. The chief difference is in the
situation of these statues. In the case of a built temple they are
monoliths, brought from a distance and erected in front of the
pylon. But space was wanting for such an arrangement at
Ipsamboul ; besides which it was better, for many reasons, that
the whole edifice should be homogeneous, and that the statues
should be carved in the rock from which its chambers were to
be cut. The way to do this was obvious. The colossi had
but to recede a pace or two so as to be incorporated in the
substance of the pylon itself.
At Ipsamboul there are, as we have seen, two temples close to
one another. Their facades, though conceived in the same spirit,
executed by the same processes, and having a good deal in common
in their design, are yet by no means similar. That of the temple of
Hathor, generally called the Smaller Temple, is on a smaller scale
than the Great Temple, but perhaps its design is the happier and
more skilful of the two. The front is 90 feet wide and nearh'
40 high. It is ornamented by six colossal upright statues, four ot
them Rameses himself, the other two his wife Nefert-Ari. These
statues, which are about 34 feet high, are separated one from
another by eight buttresses, two of them acting as jambs for the door, above which they unite and become a wide band of flat
carvinof markingf the centre of the facade. The gentle salience oi
these buttresses forms a framework for the statues (see Fig. 242),
which are chiselled with orreat care and skill in the fine vellow
sandstone of which the mountain consists.
The facade of the Great Temple is much larger. It is about
130 feet wide by 92 high. It is not divided by buttresses like the
other, but it has a bold cornice made up of twenty-two cynocephalic
figures seated with their hands upon their knees. Each of these
animals is sculptured in the round, and is only connected with the
face of the rock by a small part of its posterior surface. They
are not less than seven feet high. A frieze, consisting of a
dedicatory inscription carved in deep and firmly drawn hiero
glyphs runs below the cornice. Above the doorway a colossal
ficfure of Ra is carved in the rock, and on each side of him
Rameses is depicted in low relief, in the act of adoration. This
group occupies the middle of the facade. But the most striking
feature of the building is supplied by the four colossi of
Rameses placed two and two on either side of the door. They

are the largest in Egypt. From the sole of the feet to the apex of
the pschent which the king bears on his head, they are about sixty
five feet in height. Rameses is seated, his hands upon his thighs,
in the pose ordinarily made use of for the royal statues at the
entrances of the temples. In spite of these enormous dimensions

remarkable for its combination of force and sweetness, an
expression which has been noticed by all the travellers who

chamber or niche is cut, in which the rock-carved cow of Hathor
may be seen with a statue between its legs. The other temple
is a great deal larger. Its total length is about i8o feet. The
first hall is 60 feet long and 53 wide ; the roof is supported by
eight pillars, against each of which a colossal figure 33 feet high
is placed. A doorway in the middle of the further side leads to a
second chamber not quite so large as the first, and supported by
four thick square pillars. Three openings in its furthest side lead

to a third chamber, as wide as the second, but only 10 feet deep.
Through this the innermost parts of the speos are reached ; they
consist of three small chambers, those on the left and right being
very small indeed, while that in the centre, the adytum, is about
13 feet by 23. In the middle of this chamber was an altar, or
table for offerings ; at the back of it a bench with four seated
statues. The walls of both temples are covered with pictures like
those of Luxor, Karnak, and the Ramesseum. They represent

the battles and triumphs of Rameses, and the king seated upon
the laps of goddesses, who act as the tenderest of nurses.
Besides the halls which form the main body of the temple, the
plan shows eight lateral chambers, some perpendicular to the
major axis of the building, others falling upon it obliquely. .Several
of these do not seem to have been finished. There are indi
cations that they were utilized as depositories for the objects
worshipped in the temple.
We have now briefly noticed the principal rock-cut temples in
Egypt and Nubia. Neither in plan nor in decoration do they
materially differ from the temples of wrought masonry. The
elements of the building are the same, and they are arranged in
the same order—^an avenue of sphinxes when there is room for
it, colossi before the entrance, a colonnaded court, a hypostyle hall

acting as a pronaos, a naos with its secos, or sanctuary ; but some
times one, sometimes many of these divisions are excavated in the
living rock. Sometimes only the sanctuary is subterranean, some
times the hypostyle hall is included, and at Ipsamboul the whole
temple is in the mountain, from the secos to those colossal statues
which generally form the preface to the pylon of the constructed
temple.
Except in the case of the peristylar court, the interior of the
rock-cut temple did not differ so much in appearance from that ol
the constructed edifice as mieht at first be imagined. We have
already explained how scantily lighted was the interior of the
Egyptian temple ; its innermost chambers were plunged in almost
complete darkness, so that the absolute night which was involved
in their being excavated in the heart of a mountain was no very

great change from the obscurity caused by the thick walls and
heavy roofs of the edifices in the plain. In the case of a hemi
speos the internal effect must have been almost identical with that
of any other religious building. In the great temple of Ipsam
boul the daylight does not penetrate beyond the second hall ; from
that point onwards artificial light is necessary to distinguish
objects, but the Egyptians were so thoroughly accustomed to a
mysterious solemnity of shadow, to a " dim religious light," in their
temples, that the darkness of the speos would seem no drawback
in their eyes.
The column occurs very seldom in these subterranean temples.^
Even those chambers which correspond to the hypostyle hall by
their places in the excavation and the general characteristics of their
form, are hardly ever supported by anything but the' rectangular
piers in use in the early ages of the monarchy ; but these piers are
often clothed with an elaborate decoration which is unknown in
the works of the primitive architects. This preference for the pier
is easily to be explained by the necessity for having supports of
sufficient strength and solidity to bear the weight of the super
incumbent mountain. Another and more constant peculiarity of the underground
temples, is the existence in them of one or more seated statues
carved from masses of rock expressly left in the furthest recesses
of the excavation. These statues, which represent the presiding
deity of the place and his acolytes, do not occur in the constructed
temples. In the latter the tabernacle which stood in the secos
was too small to hold anything larger than a statuette or emblem.
We think that the cause of this difference may be guessed. At
the time these rock temples were cut, the Pharaohs to whom they
owed their e.xistence no doubt assigned a priest or priests to each.
But their position, sometimes in desert solitudes, as in the case
of the Speos Arteviidos, sometimes in places only inhabited for an
intermittent period, in the quarries at Silsilis for instance, or in provinces which had been conquered by Egypt and might be
lost to her again, rendered it impossible that they could be served and guarded in the ample fashion which was easy enough in the temples of Memphis, Abydos and Thebes. All these
considerations suggested that, instead of a shrine containing
' There are two polygonal columns resembling those at Beni-Hassan in the small .speos at Beit-el-Wali (Fig. 237).

some small figure or emblem, statues of a considerable size, from
six to eight or ten feet high, should be employed, and that they
should be actually chiselled in the living rock itself and left
attached to it by the whole of their posterior surfaces. By their
size and by their incorporation with the rock out of which both
they and their surroundings were cut, such statues would defend
themselves efticientJy against all attempts on the part of enemies.
In spite of their age several of these statues came down to us in
a sufficiently good state of preservation to allow ChampoUion and
his predecessors to recognize with certainty the divine personages
whom they represented. During the last fifty years they have
suffered as much at the hands of ignorant and stupid tourists as
they did in the whole of the many centuries during which they
were exposed to all the vicissitudes of Egyptian history.^
Our study of the Egyptian temple would not be complete without a few words upon the buildings called Dayr-cl-Bahari!^
By their extent, their picturesqueness, and the peculiar nature of
their situation, these ruins have always had a great effect upon
foreign visitors. Those who know Thebes will, perhaps, be
surprised at our having said so little about them hitherto,
especially as they are older than most of the buildings over
which we have been occupied. We have not yet described them
because they do not belong to any of the categories which we
have been treating ; they form a class by themselves ; their general arrangement has no parallel in Egypt, and therefore we have
reserved them to the last.
The building in question is situated at the foot of the Libyan
chain, in a deep amphitheatre hollowed out by nature in the
yellow limestone rocks which rise on the north-west of the
necropolis. On two sides, on the right and at the back, it rests
against perpendicular walls of rock cut by the picka.xe and
dominating over the built part of the temple. On the left this
natural wall is absent and is replaced by an inclosure of bricks
(Figs. 250 and 251).
' For Beit-d-Wali and Ginheh, see plates 13, 30 and 31 in Gau, Antiquitcs de la Nubie. It seems that the statues, when they wtre drawn by him, were in a fairly
good state. 2 These words mean Convent oj the North. The name is derived from an
abandoned Coptic convent which existed among the ruins of the ancient building.



42 2 A History of Art in Ancient Egypt.
Under such conditions we need feel no surprise at finding part
of the temple subterranean. In backing- his work against the
mountains in this fashion the architect must have been partly
impelled by a desire to make use of the facilities which it afforded.
The mausoleum of Hatasu, unlike the other funerary chapels at
Thebes, is, then, a triple hemispeos. At a point immediately
opposite to the door in the external pylon, but at the other
extremity of the building, a chamber about sixty-five feet deep
was excavated in the rock. This must have acted the part of a
sanctuary. Right and left of it, and at a shorter distance from the
entrance, there are two more groups of rock-cut apartments. The whole arrangement may be compared to the system of three apsidal chapels which is so common at the east end of European
cathedrals.
In approaching this temple from the river bank, a dromos of
sphinxes had to be traversed of which very scanty traces are now
to be found, but in the time of the Iiistitiit d' Egyptc there were
still two hundred of them to be distincruished, a few of the last
being shown in the restoration figured upon the opposite page
(P^ig. 251). At the end of the dromos, upon the spot where a
few traces of the bounding walls still remain, we have placed a
pylon with a couple of obelisks in front of it. We have done so
not only because nearly all the important temples had such a
preface, but also because Sir Gardner Wilkinson says that he
saw the foundations of two obelisks and of a doorway. After
passing the pylon, a first courtyard was entered, which
communicated with a second by an inclined plane stretching
almost across its width. ^ Here the arrangements which con
stituted the real originality of Dayr-el-Bahari began. The whole
interior of the temple, between the pylon and the commencement
of the speos, consisted of four courtyards, rising in terraces one
above another like the steps of a gigantic staircase. The walls
upon which these inclined planes and terraces were constructed
are still to be traced in places. In order to furnish the vast
courts, we have supposed them to contain seated statues at regular
intervals alone the inner faces of their walls ; in such matters of
' This wide inclined plane agrees better, as it seems to us, with the indications in M. Brune's plan of the actual remains at Dayr-el-Bahari, than the narrow flight
of steps given in his restoration ; the effect, too, is better, more ample and majestic.

The Temple under the New Empire. 425
decorative detail a little conjecture may perhaps be allowed.^
As for the portico which ornamented the further side of the
second court, its remains were visible even before the excavations
of Mariette."^
Those excavations have since 1858 led to the discovery of
the porticos of the third court. There seems to have been
only a plain wall on the left of this court, while on the right there was a long colonnade which masked a number of chambers cut in the rock which rose immediately behind it. Facing the
entrance to the court there was also a colonnade which was
cut in two b}^ the steps leading to the fourth and highest terrace.
In the middle of this terrace a fine doorway leading to the
principal speos was raised. While all the rest of the temple was
of limestone, this doorway was built of fine red granite, a distinc
tion which is to be explained by its central situation, facing the
gateway in the pylon though far above it, and forming the
culminating point of the long succession of terraces and inclined
planes. The attention of the visitor to the temple would be
instantly seized by the beauty and commanding position of this
doorway, which, moreover, by its broad and mysterious shadows,
suggested the secos hidden in the flanks of the mountains, to
which all the courts were but the prelude.
These terraced courts have surprised all visitors to the cenotaph
of Hatasu. " No one will deny," says RIariette, " that the temple
of Dayr-el-Bahari is a strange construction, and that it resembles
an Egyptian temple as little as possible !
" '^ Some have thought
' The same idea caused M. Brune to jilace sphinxes upon the steps between the courts ; he thought that some small heaps of debris at the ends of the steps indicated their situation ; but M. Maspero, who recently investigated the matter, informs us that he found no trace of any such sphinxes. " We must refer those who wish to study the remains of this temple in detail to the work devoted to it by M. Mariette. The plan which forms plate i in the said
work w-as drawn, in 1866, by an architect, M. Brune, who is now a professor at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. M. Brune succeeded, by intelligent and conscientious examination of all the remains, in obtaining the materials for a restoration which gave us for the first time some idea of what this interesting monument must have been in the great days of Egypt. Plate 2 contains a restored plan ; plate 3 a view in perspective of the three highest terraces and of the hill which forms their support. We have attempted to give an idea of the building as a whole. Our view is taken from a more distant point than that of M. Brune, but except in some of the less important details, it does not gieatly differ from his. ^ Mariette, Dayr-cl-Bahari, letterpress, p. 10.

foreign influence was to be traced in its arrangements. " Are
we to consider it an accident, asks Ebers, that the stepped
building at Dayr-el-Bahari was built shortly after an Egyptian army had, under Thothmes, trodden the soil of Mesopotamia
for the first time, and found monumental buildings constructed
in terraces in its great cities ? Why did the Egyptians, who
as a rule were so fond of repeating themselves that they
became almost incapable of inventing new forms, never imitate
the arrangements of this imposing building elsewhere, unless it
was because its forms reminded them of their foreign enemies and therefore seemed to be worthy of condemnation ? " ^
We are content with asking the question and with calling
attention to its interest. The materials are wanting for a definite
answer but the suggestion of Professor Ebers is probable enough.
Twelve or thirteen centuries later the Persians, after their
conquest of Egypt, carried back with them the notion of those
hypostyle halls which gave to the buildings of Persepolis so
different an aspect from those of Assyria, although the decorative
details were all borrowed from the latter country. So too the
Egyptians, in spite of the pride which they felt in their ancient
civilization, may have been unable to control their admiration
when they found themselves, in the wide plains of Persia, before
those loft)' towers with their successive terraces, to which access
was obtained by majestic flights of steps. It seems by no means
unlikely that one of their architects should have attempted to
acclimatize an artistic conception which was so well calculated
to impress the imaginations of the people ; and none of the
sovereigns of Egypt was better fitted to preside over such an
attempt than the high spirited and enterprising Hatasu, the
queen who reared two obelisks in the temple of Karnak, one of
them being the highest that has remained erect ; who made the
first recorded attempt at acclimatization ; - and who was the first
to launch a fleet upon the waters of the Red Sea.
' Ebers, /Egypten, p. 285. ° Maspkro, Histoire Aitcicniie, pp. 202, 203. The bas-reliefs at Dayr-el-Bahari represent the booty brought back by flatasu from the expedition into Fount. Among this booty thirt)'-two perfume shrubs, in baskets, may be distinguished ; these shrubs were planted by the orders of Hatasu in the gardens of Thebes. On the subject of Hatasu and her expedition, see Maspero's paper entitled : De quelques Navigatio}is des Egxptiens siir Ics Coles de la Afer Ervthrce (in the Revue Hisfori'jiie,
1878).



The Temple under the New Empire. 427
Whether Hatasu's architect was inspired by those artistic crea
tions of the Chaldees which, as time went on, were multiplied over
the whole basin of the Euphrates and even spread as far as northern
Syria, or whether he drew his ideas entirely from his own brain,
his work was, in either case, deserving of high praise. In most
parts of the Nile Valley sites are to be found which lend them
selves readily to such a building. The soil has a gentle slope,
upon which the erection of successive terraces would involve no
architectural difficulties, and there is no lack of rocky walls against
which porticoes could be erected, and in which subterranean
chambers could be excavated. Upon a series of wide platforms
and easy gradients like these, the pompous processions, which
played such an important part in the Egyptian ritual, could defile
with great effect, while under every portico and upon every
landing place they could find resting places and the necessary
shelter from the sun. Why did such a model find no imitators }
Must we seek for the reason in the apparent reaction against her
memory which followed the death of Hatasu } '' The Egyptian
people chose to look upon her as an usurper ; they defaced the
inscriptions which celebrated her campaigns ; they eftaced her
cartouches and replaced her titles with those of her brothers." '
It is certain that nowhere in Eg) pt has any building of con
siderable dimensions been discovered in which the peculiar
arrangements of Dayr-el-Bahari are repeated. At most it may
be said that something of the same kind is to be found in those
rock-cut temples of Nubia which are connected with the river
bank by a dromos and flights of steps. When the princes of the
nineteenth dynasty wished to raise funerary temples to their
memory in their own capital, it would have been easy, had they
chosen, to find sites upon the slopes of the western chain similar to that which Hatasu had employed with such happy results ; but
they preferred a different combination. They erected their ceno
taphs in the plain, at some distance from the hills, and they chose
a form which did not essentially differ from that of the great
temples on the opposite bank of the Nile.
The religious architecture of Egypt, in all its richness and
variety, is known to us only through the monuments of the second Theban Empire, through the great works of the kings
belonging to the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. We are

428 A History of Art in Ancient Egytt.
tempted, however, to believe that the architects of the Sait period
must have introduced fresh beauties into the plans, proportions,
and decorations of those temples which the princes of the twenty
sixth dynasty, in their desire that their capital and the other cities
of the Delta should rival or excel the magnificence of Memphis
and Thebes, confided to their skill. Both the statues and the
royal tombs of the Sait period have characteristics which dis
tinguish them from those of earlier epochs. In all that we
possess from this last period of artistic activity in Egypt, there
is a new desire for elegance, for grace, carried sometimes to an
extreme which is not free from weakness and affectation. It is
probable that the same qualities existed in the religious architecture
of Sais.
Unhappily all the buildings constructed in Memphis and Lower
Egypt during the Sait supremacy have disappeared leaving
hardly a trace behind, and the Greek writers have left us nothing
but vague accounts to supply their place. Herodotus goes into
ecstasies over the propylsa, that is, the pylons and outer courts,
which Amasis added to the temple of Neith at Sais, and over the
enormous size of the stones employed. He describes in great
detail a chapel carved out of a single block of Syene granite,
which Amasis transported from the quarries at great cost in order
that it might be erected in the sanctuary of the said temple
;
unhappily it was so much injured on the journey that his intention
had to be abandoned.'
All that we learn from the historian is that the Sait princes
made use of colossal stones in their buildings without much
regard to their appropriateness, but simply to impress their con
temporaries with an exaggerated idea of their wealth and power.
The contractors of an earlier age were also in the habit of
employing blocks which seem astonishing to us from their length and size, but they were never used except when they were
required, to cover a void or some other purpose ; the earlier
architects never made the mistake of seeking for difficulties
merely to show how cleverly they could overcome them.
It is to be regretted that we know so little of the monument attributed by Herodotus to Psemethek, and described by him in
the followinof terms :— " Havine become master of the whole of

Herodotus, ii. 175.



The Temple under the New Empire. 429
Egypt, Psammitichos constructed those propylaea of the temple of
Hephaistos which he to the south of that building. In front of
these propylaea he also caused to be constructed an edifice in which Apis was nourished as soon as he had manifested himself
It was a peristyle ornamented with figures. Colossal statues,
twelve cubits high, were employed as supports, instead of columns." ^
We may assume that these colossi were, as in other Egyptian
buildings, placed immediately in front of the real supports, and did
not themselves uphold an entablature. Herodotus was not an
architect, and, in taking account merely of the general effect,
he doubtless used an expression which is not quite accurate.
The most important point to be noticed in this short extract
from the Greek historian is the hint it contains of the attempts
at originality made by the later generations of Egyptians, by
" men born too late in too old a century," and of the means by
which they hoped to rival their predecessors. The architect of Psemethek borrowed a motive which had long been disused, of which, however, there are many examples at Thebes, and
employed it under novel conditions.
The caryatid form of pier is generally found, in temples, in the
peristyles of the fore-courts or the hypostyles of the pronaos.
Psemethek made use of it t'or the decoration of what was no
more than a cattle stable.^ The stable in question had, it must
be confessed, a god for its inhabitant, and so far it might be called
a temple ; but it was a temple of a very pecu.liar kind, in which
the arrangements must have i:een very different from those required in the abode of an inanimate deity. In it the god
was present in flesh and blood, and special arrangements were
necessary in order to provide for his wants, and to exhibit him to
the crowd or conceal him, as the ritual demanded. The problem
was solved, apparently, in a method satisfactory to the Egyptians,
as the guide who attended Herodotus called his attention to
the building with an insistance which led the historian to pay it
special attention.
Herodotus does not tell us what form the caryatides took in this
instance. It is unlikely that they were Osiride figures of the king,
as in the Theban temples, but as Apis was the incarnation of
' Herodotus, ii. 153. " Herodotus uses tlic word a'-Xy, of which stable or cattle-shed was one of the primitive meanings.

Ptah, the great deity of Memphis, they may very possibly have
been carved in the imao-e of that god. • Between the days of Camb)ses and those of Alexander, Egypt temporarily recovered her independence more than once. The
art of that period — during which numerous works were carried
out and many others restored — was a prolongation of the art of
the Salt princes. Its aims, methods, and taste were entirely
similar. We may, therefore, in spite of the limits which we have
imposed upon ourselves, mention a work carried out no more than
fifty years before the Greek conquest, in the reign of Nectanebo I.
We mean the small building which is sometimes called the southern
temple, in the island of Philse. It is the oldest building upon the
island, all the rest being Ptolemaic or Roman. Its arrangements are different to anything we have hitherto
encountered in religious architecture. There are no internal sub
divisions of any kind, nothing which resembles a secos. According
to all the plans which have been published, it contained only one
hall, or rather rectangular court, inclosed by fourteen graceful
columns and a low, richly-decorated wall, which forms a kind of
screen between the lower part of the columns. This screen does
not extend quite half-way up the columns ; these latter support an
entablature, but there has never been a roof of any kind. There
can be no doubt that the building was consecrated to Isis, whose
image is carved all over it ; but could an edifice thus open to the
outward air and .to every prying eye be a temple ? Ebers is
disposed to look upon it as a waiting-room.^ Close to it the
remains of a wide staircase are to be traced, against which boats
were moored, and upon which they discharged their loads. Thus
the faithful who came to be present at the rites of Isis would
assemble in the waiting-hall, whence they would be conducted by
the priests to that sanctuary which became the object of so
many pilgrimages in the later years of the Eg\-ptian monarchy.
Certain peculiarities in the management of the column, which
grew into frequent use in the Ptolemaic epoch, are here encoun
tered for the first time. This is not the place for its detailed
consideration, but one must point it out as a second result of the
desire shown by the architects of the period to achieve new developments without breaking the continuity of the national
traditions. Here, as in the monumental cattle-shed at Memphis,

there is no invention of new forms ; all the architectural elements
introduced are to be found in earlier buildings. It is the general aspect and physiognomy of the building that is new. Whatever
we may call it, the edifice erected by Nectanebo at the southern
point of the island is certainly novel in form ; we have found
nothing like it either in Egypt or in Nubia, but the repetition of its
forms in a much later generation proves that it answered to a
real change in the national taste and to new aspirations in the
national genius. Painting, engraving, and photography have
given us countless reproductions of the picturesque building
which rises on the eastern shore of the island, amid a bouquet
of palm-trees. It has been variously called the bed of Pliaraoh,
the eastern temple, the great hyperthra, the suuimer-housc of
Tiberijis, &c. It is nothing more than a replica of Nectanebo's
creation ; it is larger and its proportions are more lofty, but its
plan is quite similar.^ In the sketch lent to us by M. Hector
Leroux, the eastern temple is seen on the right, while the left
of the drawing is filled up with the pylons of the great temple
of Isis (Fig. 252).
If we knew it better, we should probably find that the archi
tecture of the Sait period formed the transition between that of
the second Theban empire and that of the Ptolemies. We should
find in it at least hints and foreshadowinofs of those origfinal
features of which we shall have to speak when we arrive at the
Graeco- Egyptian temples. Unhappily, as none of the temples built by Psemcthek, Amasis, and their successors have been
recovered from the sands of Egypt, we shall be reduced to
conjecture on this point. But must all hope of recovering some
thing from the ruins of Sais be abandoned ? Mariette himself
made some excavations upon its site, and confessed that he was
discouraged by their result, or rather by their want of result.
Perhaps, however, deeper and more prolonged excavations might
bring to light sufficient indications of the ordonnance and plans
of the more important buildings to permit of some attempt at
restoration being made.^
' The temple of Kerdasch or Gaiiasse in Nubia resembles the Eastern Temple at Philse in plan ; its date appears to be unknown. - We have omitted to speak of those little temples known since the time of Champollion as iiiaiiimisi or places for accouchement, because the existing examples all belong to the Ptolemaic period.

434 A History of Art in Anciekt Egypt.
§ 4. General Charactcj-istics of the Egyptian Temple.
We have now conducted our history of the Egyptian temple
from the most ancient monument to which that title can be given
to the period when Greek art, introduced into the country by the Macedonian conquest, began to have an influence upon many of
the important details, if not upon the general aspects of the
national architecture. The reader will not be surprised to find
that before we conclude our study we wish to give a resnnid of the
leading ideas which seem to be embodied in the temple, and to
define the latter as we see it in its finest and most comjjlete
expression, in the buildings of the great Theban Pharaohs. We
cannot do better for our purpose than borrow the words of Mariette upon the subject. No one has become more thoroughly
acquainted with the temples of the Nile valley. He visited them
all at his leisure, he explored their ruins and sounded most of them
down to their foundations, and he published circumstantial descrip
tions of Abydos, Karnak, Dayr-el-Bahari, and Denderah. In these monographs and in the Itindraire de la Haute-Egypte, he
returned to his definition again and again, in a continual attempt
to improve it, to make it clear and precise. We shall freely
extract from his pages all those expressions which seem to us to
give the best rendering of their author's ideas, and to bring out
most clearly the originality which belongs to the monuments
of \vhich he treats.^
" The Egyptian temple must not be confused with that of
Greece, with the Christian church, or with the Mohammedan
probable, however, that tlie custom of building these little edifices by the side of those great temples where a triad of gods was worshipped dated back as far as the Pharaonic period. The mammisi symbolised the celestial dwelling in which the goddess gave birth to the third person of the triad. The authors of the Dtscription called them Typhoiiia, from the effigy of a grimacing deity which figures in their decoration. This deity has, however, nothing in common with Set-Typhon, the enemy of Osiris. We now know that his name was Bes, that he was imported into Egypt from the country of the Aromati, and that he presided over the toilette of women. (Eeers, L'EgypU, etc., p. 255.)

General Characteristics of the Egyptian Temple. 435
mosque. It was not a place for the meeting of the faithful, for
the recital of common prayers ; no public ritual was celebrated
within it ; no one was admitted to it except the priests and the
king. The temple was a kind of roj-al oratory, a monument
reared by the king in token of his own piety, and in order to
purchase the favour of the gods.
" The elaborate decoration with which all the walls of the temples are covered is only to be e.xplained ' by admitting this
point of departure. The essential element of this decoration is the picture ; many pictures are arranged symmetrically side by
side, and tiers above tiers of pictures cover the walls from floor to
ceiling. This arrangement never varies, and the same may be
said of the general significance of the pictures : on the one hand,
the king, on the other, one or more deities ; these are the subjects
of all the compositions. The king makes an offering (meats, fruits,
flowers, emblems) to the god and asks for some favour at his
hands ; in his answer the deity grants the favour demanded. The
whole decoration of a temj^le consisted therefore in an act of
adoration on the part of the monarch repeated in various forms.
The temple was therefore the exclusive personal monument of the
prince by whom it was founded and decorated. This fact explains
the presence of those precious representations of battles which
adorn the external walls of certain temples.^ The king ascribed
all his successes in the field to the immediate protection of the
gods. In combating the enemies of Egypt, in bringing them by
thousands to the capital, in employing them upon the construction
of their temples, he was performing an act as agreeable to the
ofods as when offerinof incense, flowers, and the limbs of the
animals sacrificed. By such deeds he proved his piety and
merited the continuation of those favours for which the erection of a temple was meant to be an acknowledgment." The piety and gratitude of the monarch also found expression
in the splendour of the great festivals of which the temple was the
scene several times in the course of the year. " The ceremonies
consisted for the most part of great processions, issuing from the
sanctuary to be marshalled in the hypostyle hall, and afterwards
traversing the open courts which lay between the buildings of
' The canal figured in front of the Chariot of Rameses, in Fig. 254 was, according to Ebers, the oldest of the Suez Canals, the one dug by Seti I. This canal was
defended by fortifications, and is called in inscriptions the Cutting {L'Egypte, etc.).

the temple and the great wall which incloses the whole. They
perambulated the terraced roofs, they launched upon the lake the
sacred barque with its many-coloured streamers. Upon a few
rare occasions the priests, with the sacred images, sallied from the
inclosure which ordinarily shielded their rites from profane eyes,
and, at the head of a brilliant flotilla, directed their course to some
other city, either by the Nile or by the waterway which they
called ' the sacred canal.' " '
" The ensigns of the gods, the coffers in which their effigies or
symbolic representations were inclosed, their shrines and sacred
barques were carried in these processions, of which the kings were
the reputed conductors. At other times all these objects were

deposited in the naos. Upon the occurrence of a festival, the priest to whom the duty was delegated by the king entered the
naos and brought out the mysterious emblem which was hidden from all other eyes ; he covered it with a rich veil, and it was
then carried under a canopy."
A
ritual to which so much " pomp and circumstance " was
attached required material appliances on a great scale. The
preservation of so much apparatus required e.xtensive store-rooms,
which, like the sanctuary itself, had to be kept in almost total
darkness in order to preserve the sacred vestments and other
' To follow these processions was an act of piety. Upon a Theban stele we find the following words addressed to Amen-Ra : " I am one of those who follow thee when thou goest abroad."

objects from the deteriorating effects of sun, dust, heat, and the
insects which they engender. There is nothing in the texts which
seems to hint at the celebration of any rites in the dark parts of
the temple by artificial light, and no trace of the discoloration
caused by smoke has been found upon the walls. There seems to have been no necessity for anything beyond the most subdued
daylight within the chambers of the temple. All the important
part of the ritual was performed in the open air, and the few
liturgical acts in the naos were short and took place before a
very restricted audience. They consisted of a few prayers said by
the king or by the chief priest, and in the presentation of the
traditional offerings. The cares of maintenance and of preparation
for the periodical festivals had also to go on in that part of the
temple. Such duties, however, could be readily discharged by the
practised and disciplined jsriests in the half light of the sanctuary,
and even the almost total darkness of the apartments which were
ranged behind it.
" The temples show no trace of dwelling-places for the priests,
nor of places for initiation, nor of any contrivance for divination or
the giving of oracles. There is nothing to lead us to suppose that,
except the king and the priests, any of the public were admitted
into the building," at least beyond the hypostyle hall. Certain
privileged individuals or classes were admitted into the latter on
the occasion of a festival ; others, less fortunate, were compelled to
wait in the courtvards. It was their rio-ht to be the first to see the
god as he emerged from the sanctuary on the shoulders of the
priests. But in spite of their vast dimensions, these halls would
have been ill fitted for the uses to which the spacious naves of a
church or mosque are put. The huge and closely spaced columns would embarras the movements and intercept the view of those
who crowded about their bases. It was only in the central aisle that
sufficient space was left for the easy passage of a procession. The
hypostyle hall was lofty and wide in order that it might be a vesti
bule worthy of the god who dwelt in the sanctuary beyond it, and
in order that it might bear witness by its magnificence to the piety,
wealth, and power of the king who constructed it. It offered no
place in which the faithful could assemble to listen to religious
discourses, to unite in the expression of their faith and hope, to sing and pray in common.

In virtue of the sanctuary which was its nucleus, the temple was
the dwelling of the god, the terrestrial resting-place to which the
king, his son and the nursling of the goddesses, came to offer him
thanks and to do homage in return for the protection and support
which he received. The temple was also, in virtue of those
numerous chambers which surrounded the sanctuary, a place for
the preparation, consecration, and preservation of holy objects ; a
huge sacristy to which access was forbidden to all but those who
were specially attached to the service of the god and charged with
the custody of the sacred furniture.
Such being the origin and purpose of the temple, we need feel
no surprise at the triple fortification behind which it was en
trenched. This fortification consisted, in the first place, of the brick
wall which formed the outermost inclosure ; secondly, of the wall of masonry which embraced the temple proper, leaving a narrow
passage only wide enough for the walk of a sentry ; thirdly, of
the wall which divided the really secret parts of the building from
the pronaos. Now that the line of the external wall is only indi
cated by a gentle swell of the ground, now that the best preserved
of the inner walls are broken down in many places, and now
that all the roofs and ceilings have fallen and encumbered the
floors, it is difficult enough to form a true idea of the former ap
pearance of the Egyptian temples. Could we see them as they
left their architects' hands, we should be struck by the jealous
severity of their isolation, by the austere monotony of the
screen of stone which was interposed between the eyes of the
people and the internal splendours of the building. In this we
should find the chief point of distinction between the temples
of Egypt and those great religious edifices of our own times
with which we half involuntarily compare all other works of the
kind.
But the Greek temple was no more a church than its Egyptian
rival. It was not a place of assembly for public praise or religious
teaching. Its cella was an inclosed chamber, illuminated only
by the door and by a few openings contrived in the roof, and
reserved for the god who inhabited it. The two architects in fact,
Egyptian and Greek, had the same points of departure ; the problems which they had to solve strongly resembled each other,
and }-et they created types which differed very greatly. The



General Characteristics of the Egyptian- Temple. 441
Greek temple was not isolated and hidden behind a stone curtain ;
it could be seen from all sides in its commanding position ; its
encircling band of porticos seemed to invite all comers to the
shelter of their galleries, while they charmed all eyes with the
play of light and shadow afforded by their alternate voids and
solids. The colonnades reserved by the Egyptian for the
decoration of courts and halls were placed by the Greek upon
the external faces of his temples, and although the task of both

architects was to fulfil almost identical requirements, this trans
position of the elements employed was sufficient to cause a
profound difference in the outward expression, in the physiognomy,
of their several works.
Another and perhaps still more characteristic difference is to
be found in tlie tact that the Greek temple is not susceptible.

like that of Egypt, of almost infinite extension. Greece never
produced anything like Karnak or Luxor ; even in the centuries
when the taste for the colossal eclipsed the love for the great,
she never dreamed or imagined anything of the kind. The
Greek temple had the unity of a living organism. Given the
main dimensions, and the elements of which it was to be composed
could only vary within very narrow limits. In accordance with
the degree of luxury desired, the cella would be either
surrounded by a simple wall or would be encircled by a portico,
but this portico would only be a kind of adornment, a vesture
which would be more or less rich and ample according to
circumstances. Behind the lonof files of columns on either side,
behind the double or triple rows which veiled the two facades,
the body of the temple could always be discerned, just as the
modelling of the human form may be distinguished under the
drapery of a statue, in spite of the folds which cover it. The cella
was proportioned to the sacred figure which was to be its in
habitant, which, again, afforded a standard by which the proportions
and subjects of the groups which filled the pediments, and of the
bas-reliefs of the frieze, as well as the height of the columns and
the projection of the entablature, were determined. Between
all these parts there was an intimate and clearly defined
connection.
When a plant is seen bursting from the seed, we are able, if
we know the species to which it belongs, to say beforehand what
its leaves, its flower, and its fruit will be like, and to foretell the
limits of its height. It is the same, to a great extent, with the
Greek temple. The trench dug to receive the footing stones
of the cella walls is the hole into which the seed is thrown from
which the whole temple is to spring. These walls rise above
the level of the ground, the building progresses to completion,
but from the day upon which the seed was sown, from the day
upon which the foundation was laid, the temple had been virtually
complete. Like an organic body, the Greek temple inclosed
within itself the principle of its own growth, the law which governed its development, and forbade it in advance to excede
certain definite limits.
. Such was not the case with the Egyptian temple. In those of
small or moderate dimensions this unity and simplicity of plan

exists to a certain extent. The peripteral temple of Elephantine
and even the temple of Khons may be given as instances of this
;
in them there is much with which the most exclusive philo-Greek
can sympathize. The impression received from the ruins of
Abydos or Gournah, still more from those of Karnak or Luxor,
is very different. There we find several sanctuaries closely
wedged tog^ether, all of the same size and decorated in the same
fashion, in one place the architect has built seven in a row, and
there was nothing to prevent him doubling the number if he had
chosen to do so. In another we find a succession of courts, of
hypostyle halls and chambers, of forests of columns. Sometimes
it requires considerable search to pitch upon the sanctuary, which,
again, is not the loftiest part of the building, being dominated by
hypostyle hall and pylons.
When Egypt had arrived at the summit of her greatness and
wished to erect temples to her gods which should be worthy both
of herself and of them, she found herself obliged either to sacrifice
the unity of the temple by dividing it up into distinct naves and
sanctuaries, or to hide the main parts by the accessories in such
a fashion that the sanctuary seems to be lost among the annexes
which envelop it in front and rear. The vestibule and other
subsidiary parts mask the real dwelling of the god. We are
sometimes at a loss to decide the uses of all the chambers of so vast and complex a structure, because our knowledge of the
circumstances of ancient Egyptian worship is still far from
complete. It is significant that even among such an imposing
pile of buildings as those of Karnak, egyptologists have found
it impossible to agree as to the situation of the heart and organic
centre of the whole. That centre exists ; it existed before
all those sumptuous additions of which it was the cause. But it
would seem that its influence failed to make itself felt beyond a
certain distance. The temple was enlarged by additions made
at its two extremities, in the manner of an inorganic body, so that
no limit could be logically assigned to its development. Karnak,
as it was left by the Pharaohs and their successors, is the most
colossal work of architecture which has come down to us from
antiquity, and yet our imagination can give to it even greater
dimensions than it actually possessed without injury to its
artistic expression. If the worship of which it was the scene

had endured a few centuries longer, it would have been easy
to add new pylons, new courts, and new hypostyle halls to those already existing ; but had the worship of Athene endured through as many ages as that of Ptah or Amen, it would have
been impossible to make additions to the Parthenon as it left the
hands of Ictinus and Phidias.
