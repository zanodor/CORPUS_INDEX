# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Śrī Kr̥ṣṇa avatāra, July 27, 3112 BCE; Rohiṇī nakṣatra (vr̥ṣabha rāśi), śravaṇa month, Sri Jayanti, Janmāṣṭami.pdf

Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra, July 27, 3112 BCE; Rohiṇī nakṣatra (v ̥rṣabha rāśi), śravaṇa month, Sri Jayanti, Janmāṣṭami
-- MBh war events cannot pre-date 3112 BCE since Śrī K ̥rṣṇa is the key sūtradhāri; who is born in Kaliyuga (start date 3102 BCE) and Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra ends in 3031 BCE, 36 years after the MBh war (3067 BCE).
-- The raison d'etre for Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra is the imperative of bringing to an end the misrule of Kamsa. Kamsa (कं सः , also transliterated as Kansa) was the tyrant ruler of the Vrishni kingdom with its capital at Mathura. He was the cousin of Devaki, the mother of the god Krishna — who slew Kamsa. Kamsa is described as human in early sources and a rakshasa (demon) in the Puranas. His royal house was called Bhoja and another of his names was Bhojapati. ...upon the guidance of another advisor, Chanur, Kamsa decided to marry Asti and Prapti, the daughters of Jarasandha, King of Magadha.

Śrī K ̥rṣṇa is a kiśora -- youth of 11 years when he slew Kamsa.
नास्मत्तो युवयोस्तात ननत्योत्कण्ठितयोरनि । बाल्यिौगण्डकै शोरा : िुत्राभ्यामभवन्‍्ककव नित् ॥ ३ ॥ ŚB 10.45.3
[Lord Kṛṣṇa said:] Dear Father, because of Us, your two sons, you and mother Devakī always remained in anxiety and could never enjoy Our childhood, boyhood or youth. "Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī discusses this verse as follows: “One may object that at this point Lord Kṛṣṇa had not actually passed the kaiśora stage [age ten to fifteen], since the
women of Mathurā had stated, kva cāti-sukumārāṅgau kiśorau nāpta-yauvanau: ‘Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma have very tender limbs, being still at the kiśora stage, not having reached adolescence.’ (Bhāg. 10.44.8) The definition of the different stages of growing up is given as follows:



kaumāraṁ pañcamābdāntaṁ paugaṇḍaṁ daśamāvadhi kaiśoram ā-pañcadaśād yauvanaṁ tu tataḥ param
‘The kaumāra stage lasts until the age of five, paugaṇḍa up to age ten and kaiśora to age fifteen. From then on, one is known as yauvana.’ According to this statement, the kaiśora period ends at the age of fifteen. Kṛṣṇa was only eleven years old when He killed Kaṁsa, according to Uddhava’s words: ekādaśa-samās tatra gūḍhārciḥ sa-balo ’vasat. ‘Like a covered flame, Lord Kṛṣṇa remained there incognito with Balarāma for eleven years.’ (Bhāg. 3.2.26) And since Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma never took brahminical initiation in Vrajabhūmi, it was at the time [of Their going to Mathurā] that Their kaiśora stage began rather than ended."

I quote extensively from the superb monograph of Dr. VIneet Aggarwal, Dec. 12, 2013:
[quote]The earliest authentically dateable reference to Krishna is from the Chandogya Upanishad (3.17.6). Composed around 900 BCE, it mentions Vasudeva-Krishna as the son of Vasudev and Devaki and the disciple of Ghora Angirasa.
Yāska's Nirukta, (600 BCE), one of the greatest etymological Sanskrit dictionaries, contains a reference to the Syamantaka jewel, from the well known Puranic story about Krishna.
Pāṇini, the ancient grammarian and author of Asthadhyayi (6th century BCE) mentions Vāsudev, Kauravs and Pandavs and testifies to them being contemporaries of each other. He mentions Vasudev Krishna and Arjun together as Vasudevarjunabhyam vun in Sutra 4.3.98. • Buddhist literature records Krishna earliest in the Ghata-Jataka (300 BCE) as an ancient ruler of India and gives an account of His exploits that corresponds quite well with the Hindu tradition. There's a good record of the presence of Vasudev, Baladev, killing of Kamsa and their cousins the Kurus.
• Mahaummagga Jataka (around 3rd century BCE), states that Jambavati was one of the consorts of Vasudeva Kanha which matches with the description from the Bhagavatam.
• Around 150 BCE, Patanjali in his Mahabhashya praises Krishna and Samkarshan (Balrama) and describes dramatic performances representing the killing of Kamsa by Vasudev (Krishna-Kamsopacharam).
• Megasthenes (350BCE), the Greek Ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya, the first unifier of Medieval India, identifies Krishna with the Greek Herakles or Hercules in his famous work Indica.
From descriptions given in the Indica, there's little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to Krishna's dynasty, the Shurasena Yadavs; Methora to Mathura; Kleisobora to Krishnapura, and Jobares to Yamuna, the river from Krishna's life-story.
• Quintus Curtius also mentions that when Alexander confronted Porus/Puru on the banks of the Indus, Porus's soldiers were carrying an image of Herakles in their vanguard.



• The court scholar of Mauryas, states that the city Polibrotha (Pataliputra or Patna) was founded by Herakles, 138 generations before the reign of King Sandrocottas, the Greek name for Chandragupta Maurya.
Here is one DIRECT piece of information, which can retrospectively help us calculate the tentative time period of Krishna!
Worship of Krishna, in the form of Vasudev can also be traced to as early as 4th century BCE surprisingly, with another Greek connection!
The Greek emperor ALEXANDER's career more or less came to a halt after his brief encounter with the king of the Indus region, PORUS/Parvateshwar. The Greeks however, had some success ruling as kings in north-western cities such as the one in Taxila/Takshila. They exchanged ambassadors with Indian kings and one such ambassador was Heliodorus who was sent from Taxila to the court of King Bhagabhadra at Videsha (Besnagar, central India).
Greek Embassies in Ancient India
Interestingly, this guy, has left the FIRST historical record of a Greek becoming the devotee of an Indian God, Shri Krishna!



• On his visit to Vidisha, Heliodorus erected a Garud-pillar in the honor of his 'God of Gods' Krishna which is one of the earliest direct archaeological evidence of Krishnaconsciousness in this part of the world!
The Heliodorus Pillar and Inscription
This Garuda-column of Vasudev (Krishna), The God of gods, Was erected here by Heliodorus, A worshipper of Vishnu, The son of Dion, and Inhabitant of Taxila, Who came as the Greek ambassador, From the Great King Antialkidas, To King Kashiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior, Then reigning prosperously in the fourteenth year of his kingship.ween Hercules and Chandragupta Maurya giving the time of Krishna somewhere close to 3300 BCE.Historians and scholars have recognized Heliodorus as the first western convert to the principles of Vaishnavism!!
• Similarly, the Ghosundi and Hathibara inscriptions of 2nd century BCE record the consruction of an enclosure around Narayana Vatika where lay a fossilised stone called the Shaligram for the divinities of Samkarshana & Vasudeva in the east of village Nagari in Udaipur district of Rajasthan.
• Another discovery of the Indo-Greek period, are the gold coins of Agathocles (200 BCE) bearing the images of Balaram holding his plow on one side and Vasudev Krishna holding the discus (Sudarshan Chakra) on the other!!



Agathocles coins depicting Balarama and Krishna
This coin was minted in the year 172 BCE and recovered from the Oxus valley at AiKhanum in Afghanistan. It happens to be a very important discovery showing the Sudarshan disc-bearer Vasudev and the plough-bearer Samkarshan (Balarama) on the two sides of the coin.In the 1st century BCE, there is also evidence of worship of FIVE Vrishni heroes - Krishna, Balaram, Pradyumna (Krishna's son), Samba (Krishna's second son) and Aniruddh (Krishna's grandson).
• An inscription from a Mora well, 11 kms west of Mathura records the construction of a stone temple by a royal woman, named Tosho, in the honour of Bhagavatam Panchaviranam or Five heroes of the Vrishini clan.
• Maues an Indo-Scythian king (85 BCE) was a worshipper of Balarama along with the Greek gods Zeus and Nike. Few of his coins depict a King in a cross-legged seated position and one of his coins minted in 1st century BCE depicts Balarama.
Coin of Maues depicting Balarama
• The last great Kushan king of North India and Bactria, took the title of Vasudeva I (c. 200CE) and minted coins in honor of Hindu gods.
Coins of Indo-Bactrian king Vasudev I



• Last but certainly not the least, the Aihole Inscription of King Pulakesin II dated 634 CE states the Mahabharat War was fought 3735 years before the engraving of the inscription which gives the date of 3735-634=3101 BCE.
You may wonder what all this archaeological data means. The purpose here is to show that Krishna and Balarama were recognized and worshipped as divinities since very early times and all the evidence gathered till now, seems to converge at the same time period we started with, i.e. the 3rd Millenium BCE. http://decodehindumythology.blogspot.com/2012/02/krishna-history-behind.html
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en2pXlLrlR4&t=9s (1:29) Dr. Achar's presentation in Florida
Using the same software, Dr Achar places the year of Krishna's birth at 3112 BCE. The astrological references point to a situation so unique (such as three eclipses repeating after 36 years) that they have only occurred once in last 10,000 years!!
Inspired by Dr. Achar's research, Dr. Manish Pandit, a Nuclear Medicine Physician based in the UK proffers astronomical, archaeological, linguistic and oral evidence to support the case. He has even prepared a documentary that showcases all this evidence in a ready to grasp manner. [unquote]

Temples Devoted to Krishna -
• Udupi Sri Krishna • Guruvayur • Parthasarathy, Chennai • Jagannatha Puri, Orissa • Shrinathji, Nathdwara Rajasthan In 2003, a two day seminar was held on 5th and 6th January, in Bangalore, on “The Date of Mahabharata War: Based on Astronomical Data Using Planetarium Software”, and a few of the eminent researchers who submitted papers were (1) Dr. S. Balakrishna of NASA, USA; (2) Dr. B. N. Narahari Achar, Department of Physics, Memphis University, USA; (3) Dr. R. N. Iyengar, Department of Civil Engineering, IISc, Bangalore; (4) Dr. S. Kalyanaraman, Saraswati River Research Centre, Chennai and so on. These scientists agree that there does not exist any contradiction between any two descriptions of planetary configurations given in the Mahabharata.
Lord Krishna, on His final peace mission, set out for Hastinapur on 26th September, 3067 B.C. when the moon was at the asterism Revati.
Lord Krishna arrived Hastinapur on 28th September, 3067 B.C., when the moon was at the asterism Bharani.
The full moon and lunar eclipse at Krittika occurred on 29th September, 3067 B.C.
The solar eclipse at Jyestha occurred on 14th October, 3067 B.C.
Lord Balarama set out for pilgrimage on 1st November, 3067 B.C.
The War began on 22nd November, 3067 B.C.
Lord Balarama concluded His pilgrimage on 12th December, 3067 B.C.
The winter solstice occurred on 13th January, 3066 B.C.
Bhishma died on 17th January, 3066 B.C.
The comet Mahaghora appeared at the asterism Pushya in October, 3066 B.C Mahabharat War started on November 22, 3067 BC. This comes out of astronomical evidence. And the astronomical juxtapositions are not arbitrary or those that could happen in any decade or such... but some of them have not happened since. They are THAT rare a phenomenon.
Saturn at Rohini and Mars at Jyestha with two eclipses - a Lunar eclipse at Kartik and Solar eclipse at Jyesth. (these are from Udyoga and Bhisma Parvan).
(1)Amavasya occurs in Jyestha in 19 years (2) (1) PLUS Solar Eclipse in Jyesth occurs in 340 years. (3) (2) PLUS Saturn at Rohini occurs ONCE in 7000 years.



So, that constellation in astronomy has NOT occured since Mahabharat. The date - exact one - when that would have happened is Nov 22, 3067 BC. http://sivaramaswami.media/krishnaand-mahabharat-historical-reality

July 27, 3112 BCE as Krishna’s date of birth in the Gregorian calendar 28th August 2013, the 5,125th birth anniversary of Lord Krishna, as the Chandra Devta reaches the Rohini nachatar and creates a perfect environment, it paves the way for arrival of Sri Krishna. Lord Vishnu arrived on Prithvi Lok as Sri Krishnaji, to fulfil his promise to Sri Vasudevji and Devaki, he was born as their eighth child - on the eighth day of the month of Bhadrapath. His birth on this day gave an impetus to the number eight in our astrology. At the time of his arrival, happiness replaced sorrows and depression around Vindravan. Havan yagh kunds - which were literally being shut down by Rajah Kansa during his illegal reign again began showing signs of life.
From the heavens the Devis, Devatas and Apsaras began chanting Lord Vishnu’s Mahamantra and singing His glories. On Prithvi Lok there was thunder heard from both the seas and the skies, and there was complete darkness at midnight.
As soon as Deviki gave birth to Baby Krishna, Lord Vishnu manifested himself in his full form – with four hands holding sankh, chakra, gadda and Kamal flower.



He charmed his parents with his handsome looks and dark complexion that they both bowed down to Lord Vishnu. Vasudev was so overwhelmed by the arrival of his Son that he took an immediate vow with his wife to give away 10,000 cows to Brahmans.
The science of Archeo-Astronomy has enabled us to go beyond the boundaries of conventional archaeology in tracing the historicity of some well known personages of this land, such as Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira and Shankara. Planetary configurations mentioned in the ancient scriptures pertaining to major events and personages connected, help us date events that happened around these personages, centuries and millenia ago, either manually or with more ease and accuracy, using Planetarium software.
As per the scriptures, Lord Krishna was born around midnight. That night was the eight phase of the moon known as Ashtami Tithi. The moon was near Vrshabha, the bull, i.e the Taurus constellation that houses the star Rohini. The star Rohini is known as Aldeberan in modern astronomy. The month was Shravana, one of the 12 months in the Indian calendar.
These details are clearly mentioned in the 10thSkanda, 3rd chapter of the Bhagavata Purana. The relevant sloka is,Shravana vada ashtami, Rohini Nakshtra, uditam Lagnam. This detail combined with details of sky configurations for events that happened around Krishna’s lifetimes, namely the Mahabharata, leads us to the exact birth date for Krishna.
A search leads to July 27, 3112 BCE as Krishna’s date of birth in the Gregorian Calendar.
In Indian tradition, Krishna’s birth is also called as “Sri Jayanthi”. The word “Jayanthi” has an interesting connotation in Indian Astronomy. Indian astronomers have accorded special names to lunar phases occurring at certain stars.
The lunar phase occurring at Punarvasu star in Gemini constellation is called Jaya. The lunar phase occurring at Pushya star in the Gemini constellation is called Nasini. The lunar phase seen at Shravana star in the Capricorn zodiac is called Vijaya. Similarly, the phase of the moon occurring at Rohini star is called Jayanthi. Not only from Archaeo-astronomy, but also from a wholistic analysis of data across various disciplines, today we can conclude that Lord Krishna was born in 3112 BCE. This year, 2013 CE, makes it the 5125 year since his birth, Let us celebrate this 5125th birthday of Lord Krishna, keeping in mind that India’s most beloved Divinity was indeed also a historical figure who had walked this planet about 5000 years ago.
