Śyena, Simorg, Anzu, Amśu (Soma), Indus Script
Corpora wealth-accounting ledgers, are Veda veneration continuum seeking heaven
-- Tablets of destiny brought by Śyena are Indus Script Corpora Soma, amśu wealth accounting metalwork ledgers -- Inthe prayers of R̥ gveda IV.27.1-4 the devatā is Śyena; it is the rock from which the eagle brought Soma (RV 4.26, 27)
-- Śyena citi is a Veda altar shape which is caturaśra, 'quadrangular' to bring home and purify Soma, amśu -- Soma purification is metallurgical process in Agni,'fire' in a citi, 'fire-altar' -- Offspring of Viśvakarman are artisans working with Soma, amśu to create the shared wealth of a Rāṣṭrram -- Saēna in Avestan, Simorg in Persian is cognate śyēna m̥rga (Samsk ̥rtam) -- Tablets of Destiny, vajra 'thunderbolt' are Indus Script hypertexts brought home by Śyena, amśu, Anzu to create the wealth of a Rāṣṭrram --Śyena brings Soma from heaven (RV IV.38.5), parallel narratives of saena or simorg
--Metalwork using Agni, consecrated, sacred fire constituted a revolutionary phenomenon of the Bronze Age in a way men and women related to and worked with products of nature, mineral ores, in particular, which created a new meaning for Soma, ayas, 'alloy metal' or wealth or treasure of a nation -- Zoomorphic means 'of or relating to a deity or other being conceived of as having the form of an animal'. -- Tablets of destiny brought by Anzu (zoomorph of Veda amśu)= Śyena are
Indus Script Corpora tablets, seals and inscriptions documented by kāyastha, 'scribes' of Soma = amśu wealth accounting metalwork ledgers; this is exemplified by the anthropomorphs of Nandi or bull-man in Citragupta mandiram of Khajuraho.
-- Anzu (Sumer)(cognate amśu (RV), ancu 'iron' (Tocharian) or thunderbolt is biting into a bulllman or bull-anthropomorph, a brilliant narrative of the desire of the artisan to attain heaven, to acquire wealth, Soma.

Soma is amśu, anzu of the jangama, the itinerant artisan, seafaring merchant. Soma is the product of the strong work, profession, trade of the Meluhha artisan who is also a seafaring merchant immersed in Veda, i.e., acquiring knowledge about properties of matter and enable creation of shared wealth of a nation.
Soma is quintessential sacred process of R̥ gveda. Significance of the falcon-shape for the Citi, 'fire-altar' to process Soma, is emphatically declared in YV V.4.1.11.1: "He should pile in hawk shape who desires the sky; the hawk is the best flier among birds; verily becoming a hawk he flies to the world of heaven...by the offspring to Viśvakarman he was set free from evil; in that he offers a libation to Agni of the front, Agni of the front, delighted with his own portion, burns away his evil, and he is set free from his evil by the offering to Visvakarman." The hawk-shape or quadrangular-body shape of the falcon, in the expression Caturaśra Śyena Citi is elaborated in Veda texts. This shape yields sacred space. The bird will return the tablets of destiny, the Indus Script Corpora to the offspring of Viśvakarman, artisan par-excellence, the divinity. Artisans, maruts, Rudra, Vasu are divine and are venerated. The intensity of human endeavours to accomplish the desires gets enshrined in the famous dictum succinctly stated by Basava in the exhortaion: kāyakave kailāsa, 'work is worship'.

Sign1 of Indus Script Corpora (ASI 1977 sign list of Mahadevan). This hieroglyph signifies kāyaka 'body' rebus: kāyaka 'work, profession' PLUS meḍ 'body' rebus: meḍ, med 'iron, copper'.; thus, metal worker or metal artisan or metalsmith.
This is the highest tribute paid to the artisans of the civilization, the offspring of.Viśvakarman.
Three flying birds are abiding metaphors in R
̥
gveda.
The glosses are: śyēna, patanga, mākṣikā. The three glosses are rebus-metonymy renderings of sena 'thunderbolt'; patanga 'mercury'; mākṣikā 'pyrites' -- three references to metalwork catalogs of Bhāratam Janam, 'lit. metalcaster folk'. A variant phonetic form of mākṣikā is makha 'fly, bee, swarm of bees' (Sindhi). The rebus-metonymy for this gloss is: makha 'the sun'. Mahavira pot is a symbol of Makha, the Sun (S'Br. 14.1.1.10).
In Vedic texts, weapon of Divinity Indra is vajra, thunderbolt lightning. The name "thunderbolt" or "thunderstone" -- vajrāśani (Ramayana) --has also been traditionally applied to the fossilised rostra of belemnoids. The origin of these bullet-shaped stones was not understood, and thus a mythological explanation of stones created where a lightning struck has arisen. (Vendetti, Jan (2006). "The Cephalopoda: Squids, octopuses, nautilus, and ammonites", UC Berkeley) In Malay and Sumatra they are used to sharpen the kris, are considered very lucky objects, and are credited with being touchstones for gold.
Caturaśra Śyena Citi, the shape of the Vedic fire-altar becomes the recurrent hieroglyph used on Indus Script Corpora and in the architectural designs of sacred places of worship called mandiram or temples.

This Harappa seal h166 shows how a चतुरश्र citi or Caturaśra Śyena are comparable architectural forms.
Archiecture of Ellora Kailāsa mandiram is also Caturaśra, consistent with Veda tradition.

The evidence is emphatic that Indus Script is a Veda cultural continuum. Here are two seals which are representative; they seal the Veda foundations of Indus Script narratives in over 8000 inscriptions. The thunderbolt maker is آهن ګر āhan gar, s.m. (5th) A smith, a blacksmith (Pashto). Hence, gaṇḍabheruṇḍa idiom of the historical tradition continuum from Veda metaphors.
GonurTepe settlement layout architecture is Caturaśra 'quadrangular'.
Caturaśra Śyena Citi is a foundational framework for the processing of Soma to create the wealth of a nation by the shared wealth created by artisans and seafaring Meluhha merchants.
Section A. Śyena brings Soma from heaven
Śyena is associated with a bird of happy omen (RV II.42.3), the vigour of the falcon (RV I.118.11) brings Soma from heaven (RV IV.38.5).
A prayer for prosperity is a prayer to the heavenly falcon in Atharvaveda to be rich in food among our Fathers: Becoming a hawk he flies to the world of heaven (KYV V.4.11.1). The world of heaven is a world of prosperity and wealth; this is symbolised by Śyena 'falcon, hawk'. The worshipper and his consort climb the yupa with caṣāla 'ring of wheat chaff' which infuses carbon into the moltenmetal, and reach heaven.
RV I.32.14
14 Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him; That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst nineandninety— flowing rivers?

RV I.33.2
2 I fly to him invisible Wealthgiver- as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie, With fairest hymns of praise adoring Indra, whom those who laud him must invoke in battle.
RV I.118.11
11 Come unto us combined in love, Nasatyas come with the fresh swift vigour of the falcon. Bearing oblations I invoke you, Asvins, at the first break of everlasting morning.

YV V.4.1 to 11
PRAPATHAKA IV (4) Explanation of the Piling of the Fire Altar v. 4. 1 to 11
V.4.1
The gods and the Asuras were in conflict, they could not decide the issue; Indra saw these bodies, he put them down; with them he conferred upon himself power, strength, and body; then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. In that he puts down Indra s bodies, the sacrificer with them bestows on himself power, strength,



9
and body; verily also he piles up the fire with Indra and with a body; be prospers himself, his foe is [1] defeated. The sacrifice departed from the gods; they could not recover it; they saw these bodies of the sacrifice, they put them down, and by them they recovered the sacrifice. In that he puts down the bodies of the sacrifice, the sacrificer by them wins the sacrifice. Three and thirty he puts down; the gods are three and thirty; verily he wins the gods; verily also he piles up the fire with itself and with a body; he becomes with his body in yonder world [2], who knows thus. He puts down the lighted (bricks); verily he confers light upon it; the fire blazes piled up with these (bricks); verily with them he kindles it; in both worlds is there light for him. He puts down the constellation bricks; these are the lights of the sky; verily he wins them; the Naksatras are the lights of the doers of good deeds; verily he wins them; verily also he makes these lights into a reflection [3] to light up the world of heaven. If he were to place them in contact, he would obstruct the world of rain, Parjanya would not rain; he puts them down without touching; v rily he produces the world of rain, Parjanya is likely to rain; on the east he puts down some pointing west, on the west some pointing east; therefore the constellations move both west and east.
v. 4. 2.
He puts down the seasonal (bricks), to arrange the seasons. He puts down a pair; therefore the seasons are in pairs. This middle layer is as it were unsupported; it is as it were the atmosphere; he puts down a pair on the other layers, but four in the middle one, for support. The seasonal (bricks) are the internal cement of the layers; in that he puts down the seasonal (bricks), (it is) to keep apart the layers. He puts down next an Avaka plant; this is the birthplace of Agni; verily he piles up the fire with its birthplace [1]. Visvamitra says, He shall eat food with holy power, for whom these shall be put down, and he who shall know them thus It is the year which repels from support him who having piled up the fire does not find support; there are five layers preceding, and then he piles up the sixth; the year has six seasons; verily in the seasons the year finds support. These are the bricks [2], called the over ladies; he for whom they are put down becomes the overlord of his equals; he should think of him whom he hates as he puts (them down); verily he cuts him off for those deities; swiftly he goes to ruin. The Angirases, going to the world of heaven, made over to the seers the accomplishment of the sacrifice; it became gold; in that he anoints with fragments of gold, (it is) for the completion of the sacrifice; verily also he makes healing for it [3]; moreover he unites it with its form, and with golden light he goes to the world of heaven. He anoints with that wh ch contains the word of a thousand Prajapati is of a thousand; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati. May these bricks, O Agni, be for me milch cows he says; verily he makes them milch cows; they, milking desires, wait upon him yonder in yonder world.
v. 4. 3.



10
The fire is Rudra; he is born then when he is completely piled up; just as a calf on birth desires the teat, so he here seeks his portion; if he were not to offer a libation to him, he would suck the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer. He offers the Satarudriya (oblation); verily he appeases him with his own portion; neither Adhvaryu nor sacrificer goes to ruin. If he were to offer with the milk of domesticated animals [1], he would afflict domestic animals with pain; if (with that) of wild (animals), wild (animals); he should offer with groats of wild sesame or with groats of Gavidhuka grass; he harms neither domesticated nor wild animals. Then they say, Wild sesame and Gavidhuka grass are not a proper offering he offers with goat s milk, the female goat is connected with Agni; verily he offers with a proper offering; he harms neither domesticated nor wild animals. The Angirases going to the world of heaven [2] spilled the cauldron on the goat; she in pain dropped a feather (like hair), it became the Arka (plant); that is why the Arka has its name. He offers with a leaf of the Arka, to unite it with its birthplace. He offers standing facing north; this is the quarter of Rudra; verily he propitiates him in his own quarter. He offers on the last brick; verily at the end he propitiates Rudra. He offers dividing it into three; these worlds are three; verily he makes these worlds of even strength; at this height he offers [3], then at this, then at this; these worlds are three; ver ly he appeases him for these worlds. Three further libations he offers; they make up six, the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he appeases him. If he were to offer while wandering round, he would make Rudra come within (the sacrifice). Or rather they say, In what quarter is Rudra or in what? He should offer them while wandering round; verily he appeases him completely [4]. The highest (bricks) are the heavenly deities; over them he makes the sacrificer speak; verily by them he makes him attain the world of heaven; he should throw (the leaf) down in the path of the cattle of him whom he hates; the first beast that steps upon it goes to ruin.
v. 4. 4.
The strength on the stone (with these words) he moistens (the fire), and so purifies it; verily also he delights it; it delighted attends him, causing him neither hunger nor pain in yonder world; he rejoices in offspring, in cattle who knows thus. That food and strength, do ye, O Maruts, bounteously bestow on us he says; strength is food, the Maruts are food; verily he wins food. In the stone is thy hunger; let thy pain reach N.N.[1], whom we hate he says; verily he afflicts him whom he hates with its hunger and pain. He goes round thrice, moistening; the fire is threefold; verily he calms the pain of the whole extent of the fire. Thrice again he goes round; they make up six, the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he calms its pain. The reed is the flower of the waters, the Avaka is the cream of the waters [2]; he draws over (it) with a branch of reeds and with Avaka plants; the waters are appeased; verily with them appeased he calms his pain. The beast that first steps over the fire when piled, it is liable to burn it up with its heat.



11
He draws over (it) with a frog; this of animals is the one on which one does not subsist, for neither among the domesticated nor the wild beasts has it a place; verily he afflicts it with pain. With eight (verses) he draws across [3]; the Gayatri has eight syllables, the fire is connected with the Gayatri; verily he calms the pain of the whole extent of the fire. (He draws) with (verses) containing (the word) purifying the purifying (one) is food; verily by food he calms its pain. The fire is death; the black antelope skin is the form of holy power; he puts on a pair of black sandals; verily by the holy power he shuts himself away from death. He shuts himself away from death, and away from eating food they say; one he puts on, the other not; verily he shuts himself away [4] from death and wins the eating of food. Honour to thy heat, thy blaze he says, for paying honour they wait on a richer man; may thy bolts afflict another than us he says; verily him whom he hates he afflicts with its pain; be thou purifying and auspicious to us he says; the purifying (one) is food; verily he wins food. With two (verses) he strides over (it), for support; (with two) containing (the word) water for soothing.
v. 4. 5.
To him that sits in man hail! (with these words) he pours butter on; verily with the Pankti and the offering he takes hold of the beginning of the sacrifice. He pours on butter transversely; therefore animals move their limbs transversely, for support. If he were to utter the Vasat cry, his Vasat cry would be exhausted; if he were not to utter the Vasat cry, the Raksases would destroy the sacrifice; Vat he says; verily, mysteriously he utters the Vasat cry; his Vasat, cry is not exhausted, the Raksases do not destroy the sacrifice. Some of the gods eat the offerings [1], others do not; verily he delights both sets by piling up the fire. Those gods among gods (with these words) he anoints (it) with curds mixed with honey; verily the sacrificer delights the gods who eat and those who do not eat the offerings; they delight the sacrificer. He delights those who eat the offerings with curds, and those who do not with honey; curds is a food of the village, honey of the wild; in that he anoints with curds mixed with honey, (it serves) to win both. He anoints with a large handful (of grass); the large handful is connected with Prajapati [2]; (verily it serves) to unite it with its birthplace; with two (verses) he anoints, for support. He anoints going round in order; verily he delights them completely. Now he is deprived of the breaths, of offspring, of cattle who piling the fire steps upon it. Giver of expiration art thou, of inspiration he says; verily he bestows on himself the breaths; giver of splendour, giver of wide room he says; splendour is offspring; wide room is cattle; verily he bestows on himself offspring and cattle. Indra slew Vrtra; him Vrtra [3] slain grasped with sixteen coils; he saw this libation to Agni of the front; he offered it, and Agni of the front, being delighted with his own portion, burnt in sixteen places the coils of Vrtra; by the offspring to Visvakarman he was set free from evil; in that he offers a libation to Agni of the front, Agni of the front, delighted with his own portion, burns away his evil, and he is set free from his evil by the offering to Visvakarman. If he desire of a man, May he be set free slowly from evil [4], he should offer one by one for him; verily, slowly he is set free from evil; if he desire of a man, Swiftly may he be set free from



12
evil he should run over all of them for him and make one offering; swiftly is he set free from evil. Or rather he sacrifices separately with each hymn; verily severally he places strength in the two hymns; (verily they serve) for support.
v. 4. 6.
Do thou lead him forward (with these words) he puts on the kindling sticks; that is as when one provides hospitality for one who has come on a visit. He puts down three; the fire is threefold; verily he provides his portion for the whole extent of the fire. They are of Udumbara wood, the Udumbara is strength; verily he gives him strength. May the All gods thee he says; the All gods are the breaths; verily with the breaths [1] he raises him up; I bear up with their thoughts, O Agni he says; verily he unites him with the thought for which he lifts him up. May the five regions divine aid the sacrifice, the goddesses he says, for he moves forward along the quarters. Driving away poverty and hostility he says, for smiting away the Raksases. Giving to the lord of the sacrifice increase of wealth, he says; increase of wealth is cattle [2]; verily he wins cattle. He takes (him) with six (verses); the seasons are six; verily with the seasons he takes him; two have (the word) embracing for the smiting away of the Raksases. With the rays of the sun, with tawny hair, before us he says, for instigation. Then let our pure invocations be accepted he says; the pure (one) is food; verily he wins food. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods saw the unassailable (hymn) and with it they conquered the Asuras [3]; that is why the unassailable (hymn) has its name. In that the second Hotr recites the unassailable (hymn) the sacrificer conquers his foes therewit unassailably; verily also he conquers what has not been conquered. (The hymn) has ten verses; the Viraj has ten syllables, by the Viraj are kept apart these two worlds; (verily it serves) to keep apart these two worlds. Again the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj, in eating food. The atmosphere is as it were unreal; the Agnidh s altar is as it were the atmosphere; on the Agnidh s altar [4] he puts down a stone, for reality; with two (verses), for support. As measurer, he standeth in the midst of the sky he says; verily with this he measures; in the middle of the sky is the dappled stone set down he says; the dappled is food; verily he wins food. With four (verses) he goes up to the tail; the metres are four; verily (he goes) with the metres. All have caused Indra to wax he says; verily he attains increase. True lord and lord of strength [5], he says; strength is food; verily he wins food. Let the sacrifice invoke favour, and bring the gods he says; favour is offspring and cattle; verily be bestows on himself offspring and cattle. Let the god, Agni, offer and bring to us the gods he says, to make the cry, Godspeed! He hath seized me with the impulse of strength, with elevation he says; elevation is yonder sun in rising; depression is it when setting; verily with holy power he elevates himself, with holy power he depresses his foe.



13
v. 4. 7.
Along the eastern quarter do thou advance, wise one he says; verily with this (verse) he moves to the world of heaven. Mount ye, with Agni, to the vault he says; verily with this he mounts these worlds. From earth have I mounted to the atmosphere, he says; verily with it he mounts these worlds. Going to the heaven they look not away he says; verily he goes to the world of heaven. O Agni, advance [1] first of worshippers he says; verily with it he bestows eyesight upon both gods and men. He steps upon (the altar) with five (verses); the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he goes to the world of heaven with the full extent of the sacrifice. Night and dawn he recites as the Puronuvakya, for preparation. O Agni, of a thousand eyes he says; Prajapati is of a thousand; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. To thee as such let us pay honour; to strength hail! he says; strength is food; verily he wins food [2]. He offers on the naturally perforated brick (a ladle) of Udumbara wood filled with curds; curds are strength, the Udumbara is strength, the naturally perforated is yonder (sky); verily he places strength in yonder (sky); therefore we live on strength coming hitherward from yonder. He puts (it) in place with three (verses); the fire is threefold; verily be makes the whole extent of the fire attain support. Enkindled, O Agni, shine before us (with these words) he takes (the kindling stick) of Udumbara wood; this is a pipe with projections; by it [3] the go s made piercings of hundreds of the Asuras; in that he takes up the kindling stick with this (verse), the sacrificer hurls the hundred slaying (verse) as a bolt at his enemy, to lay him low without fail. Let us pay homage to thee in thy highest birth, O Agni (with these words) he takes up (the kindling stick) of Vikankata wood; verily he wins radiance. That various of Savitr, the adorable (with these words) be takes up (the kindling stick) of Sami wood, for soothing. The fire milks the piler up of the fire; the piler up, milks the fire; that [4] various of Savitr, the adorable he says; this is the milking of the fire. This of it Kanva Srayasa knew, and with it he was wont to milk it; in that be takes up the kindling stick with the verse, the piler up of the fire milks the fire. Seven are thy kindling sticks, O Agni, seven tongues verily he delights seven sevens of his. With a full (ladle) he offers, for Prajapati is as it were full, to obtain Prajapati [5]. He offers with a half filled (ladle), for from the half filled Prajapati created creatures, for the creation of offspring. Agni departed from the gods; he entered the quarters; he who sacrifices should think in his mind of the quarters; verily from the quarters he wins him; with curds he offers at first, with butter afterwards; verily he bestows upon him brilliance and power in accord. There is (an offering) to Vaisvanara on twelve potsherds; the year has twelve months, Agni Vaisvanara is the year; verily st aightway [6] he wins Vaisvanara. If he were to offer the fore and after sacrifices, there would be a bursting of the sacrifice; he offers an oblation with a ladle, for the support of the sacrifice. Vaisvanara is the kingly power, the Maruts the people; having offered the offering to Vaisvanara, he offers those to the Maruts; verily he attaches the people to the kingly power.



14
He utters aloud (the direction to the Agnidh) for Vaisvanara, he offers the offerings of the Maruts muttering; therefore the kingly power speaks above the people. (The offerings) are for the Maruts; the people of the gods are the Maruts; verily he wins for him by the people of the gods the people among men. There are seven; the Maruts are in seven troops; verily in troops he wins the people for him; running over troop by troop he offers; verily he makes the people obedient to him.
v. 4. 8.
He offers the stream of wealth; May a stream of wealth be mine (with this hope) is the offering made; this stream of ghee waits upon him in yonder world, swelling up. He offers with butter; butter is brilliance, the stream of wealth is brilliance; verily by brilliance he wins brilliance for him. Again the stream of wealth is desires; verily he wins desires. If he desire of a man, May I separate his breaths and his eating of food [1], he should offer separately for him; verily he separates his breaths and his eating of food; if he desire of a man, May I continue his breaths and his eating of food he should offer for him in a continuous stream; verily he continues his breaths and his eating of food. Twelve sets of twelve he offers; the year has twelve months; verily by the year he wins food for him. May for me food, for me freedom from hunger he says; that [2] is the form of food; verily he wins food. May for me fire, for me the waters be says; this is the birthplace of food; verily he wins food with its birthplace. He offers those where Indra, is half; verily he wins the deities; since Indra is half of all and a match, therefore Indra is the most appropriating of gods; he says Indralater; verily he places strength in him at the top. He offers the weapons of the sacrifice; the weapons of the sacrifice are the sacrifice [3]; verily he wins the sacrifice. Again this is the form of the sacrifice; verily he wins the sacrifice by its form. May for me the final bath and the cry of Godspeed! he says, to utter Godspeed! May the fire for me, the cauldron he says; that is the form of splendour; verily by the form he wins splendour. May the Rc for me, the Saman he says [4]; that is the form of the metres; verily by the form he wins the metres. May the embryo for me, the calves he says; that is the form of cattle; verily by the form he wins cattle. He offers the orderers, to order the disordered. He offers the even and the odd, for pairing; they are in ascending ratio, for ascent. May one for me, three he says; one and three are the metres of the gods [51, four and eight the metres of men; verily he wins both the metres of gods and men. Up to thirty three he offers; the gods are three and thirty; verily he wins the gods; up to forty eight he offers, the Jagati has forty eight syllables, cattle are connected with the Jagati: verily by the Jagati he wins cattle for him. Strength, instigation (with these words) he offers a set of twelve; the year has twelve months; verily he finds support in the year.



15
v. 4. 9.
Agni departed from the gods, desiring a portion; the gods said to him, come back to us, carry the oblation for us. He said, Let me choose a born; let them offer to me the Vajaprasaviya therefore to Agni they offer the Vajaprasaviya. In that he offers the Vajaprasaviya, he unites Agni with his own portion; verily also this is his consecration. He offers with fourteen (verses); there are seven domesticated, seven wild 1] animals; (verily it serves) to win both sets. He offers of every kind of food, to win every kind of food. He offers with an offering spoon of Udumbara wood; the Udumbara is strength, food is strength; verily by strength he wins for him strength and food. Agni is the consecrated of gods, the piler of the fire of men; therefore when it rains a piler of the fire should not run, for he has thus obtained food; rain is as it were food; if he were to run he would be running from food. He should go up to it; verily be goes up to food [2]. Night and dawn (with these words) he offers with the milk of a black cow with a white calf; verily by the day he bestows night upon him, by night day; verily day and night being bestowed upon him milk his desire and the eating of food. He offers the supporters of the kingly power; verily he wins the kingdom. He offers with six (verses); the seasons are six; verily he finds support in the seasons. O lord of the world (with these words) he offers five libations at the chariot mouth; the chariot is a thunderbolt; verily w th the thunderbolt he conquers the quarters [3]. In yonder world the wind blows over the piler of the fire; he offers the names of the winds; verily over him in yonder world the wind blows; three he offers, these worlds are three; verily from these worlds he wins the wind. Thou art the ocean, full of mist he says; that is the form of the wind; verily by the form he wins the wind. He offers with his clasped hands, for not other wise can the oblation of these be accomplished.
v. 4. 10.
The chariot of the gods is yoked for the world of heaven, the chariot of man for wherever his intention is fixed; the fire is the chariot of the gods. Agni I yoke with glory, with ghee he says; verily he yokes him; he, yoked, carries him to the world of heaven. If he were to yoke with all five together, his fire yoked would fall away, the libations would be without support, the Stomas without support, the hymns without support. He strokes (the fire) with three (verses) at the morning pressing; the fire is threefold [1]; verily he yokes the full extent of the fire; that is as when something is placed on a yoked cart; the oblations find support, the Stomas find support, the hymns find support. He strokes with two (verses) in the Stotra of the Yajnayajniya; the sacrifice is as great as is the Agnistoma; a further extension is performed over and above it; verily he mounts at the end the whole extent of the sacrifice. (He strokes) with two (verses), for support; when it is not completed by one (verse), then [2]



16
does he stroke; the rest of the sacrifice resorts to him; (verily it serves) for continuity. He who piles up the fire falls away from this world; his libation cannot be performed in a place without bricks; whatever libation he offers in a place without bricks, it runs away, and with its running away the sacrifice is ruined, with the sacrifice the sacrificer; in that he piles up a second piling, (it is) to support the libations; the libations find support [3], the sacri ice is not ruined, nor the sacrificer. He puts down eight; the Gayatri has eight syllables; verily he piles it with the Gayatri metre; if eleven, with the Tristubh, if twelve with the Jagati verily he piles it with the metres. The fire that is re piled is called the descendant; he who knowing thus re piles the fire eats food up to the third generation. The re piling is like the re establishment of the fire; he who does not succeed through the establishment of the fire [4] re establishes it; he who does not succeed by the piling up of the fire re piles it. In that he piles up the fire, (it is) for prosperity. Or rather they say, one should not pile it up. The fire is Rudra, and it is as if one stirs up a sleeping lion. But again they say, One should pile it up. It is as if one awakens a richer man with his due portion. Manu piled the fire; with it he did not prosper; he saw this re piling, he piled it, with it he prospered; in that he piles the re piling, (it is) for prosperity.
v. 4. 11.
He who desires cattle should pile a piling with the metres; the metres are cattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle. He should pile in hawk shape who desires the sky; the hawk is the best flier among birds; verily becoming a hawk he flies to the world of heaven. He should pile in heron form who desires, May I be possessed of a head in yonder world verily he becomes possessed of a head in yonder world. He should pile in the form of an Alaja bird, with four furrows, who desires support; there are four quarters; verily he finds support in the quarters. He should pile in the form of a triangle, who has foes [1]; verily he repels his foes. He should pile in triangle form on both sides, who desires, May I repel the foes I have and those I shall have verily he repels the foes he has and those he will have. He should pile in the form of a chariot wheel, who has foes; the chariot is a thunderbolt; verily he hurls the thunderbolt at his foes. He should pile in the form of a wooden trough who desires food; in a wooden trough food is kept; verily he wins food together with its place of birth. He should pile one that has to be collected together, who desires cattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle [2]. He should pile one in a circle, who desires a village; verily he becomes possessed of a village. He should pile in the form of a cemetery, who desires, May I be successful in the world of the fathers verily he is successful in the world of the fathers. Visvamitra and Jamadagni h d a feud with Vasistha; Jamadagni saw these Vihavya (bricks); he put them down, and with them he appropriated the power and strength of Vasistha; in that he puts down the Vihavyas, the sacrificer with them appropriates the power and strength of his foe.



17
He puts down on the altar of the Hotr; the Hotr is the abode of the sacrificer [3]; verily in his abode he wins for him power and strength. Twelve he puts down; the Jagati has twelve syllables, cattle are connected with the Jagati; verily with the Jagati he wins cattle for him. Eight each he puts down in the other altars; cattle have eight half hooves; verily he wins cattle. (He puts down) six on the Marjaliya; the seasons are six, the gods, the fathers, are the seasons; verily he delights the seasons, the gods, the fathers.

Sassanid silk twill textile of a simurgh in a beaded surround, 6-7th c. CE
"The simurgh was considered to purify the land and waters and hence bestow fertility. The creature represented the union between the earth and the sky, serving as mediator and messenger between the two. The simurgh roosted in Gaokerena, the Hōm (Avestan: Haoma) Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the world sea Vourukhasa. The plant is potent medicine, is called all-healing, and the seeds of all plants are deposited on it. When the simurgh took flight, the leaves of the tree of life shook making all the seeds of every plant to fall out. These seeds floated around the world on the winds of Vayu-Vata and the rains of Tishtrya, in cosmology taking root to become every type of plant that ever lived, and curing all the illnesses of mankind. The



22
relationship between the simurgh and Hōm is extremely close. Like the simurgh, Hōm is represented as a bird, a messenger and as the essence of purity that can heal any illness or wound. Hōm - appointed as the first priest - is the essence of divinity, a property it shares with the simurgh. The Hōm is in addition the vehicle of farr(ah) (MP: khwarrah, Avestan: khvarenah, kavaēm kharēno) "[divine] glory" or "fortune". Farrah in turn represents the divine mandate that was the foundation of a king's authority."Sogdian Samarqand in the 7th century AD Archaeology in the landscapes of ancient Sogd has furnished us with a great amount of works of art, mainly from the early Middle Ages. Of highest value are the wall paintings from a palace hall (object 23, room 1) of the Sogdian ruler Varxuman at Samarqand (Afrasiab site)... The western wall is the most important one in room 23/1 due to its position opposite the entrance. This feature seems to be common in Sogdian architectural layouts both of private main halls and palace throne rooms. Who is figure no. 4 of the western wall? (page II) The following proposal for an identification of figure 4 is certainly only an attempt. As we have seen, group A2 of delegates seems to belong to nations of the west. A second hint comes from the clothes of figure 4. The delicate ornamentation depicts fabulous beasts known as "Senmurvs". Look below:
Left: The Senmurvs are set into an overall pattern of curved rhomboids.



23
Right: Close-up of the garment of figure 4 Originally more than hundred human figures must have been depicted on the walls of our room. Many of these persons are dressed with richly ornamented and multicoloured clothes. But it seems noteworthy that the Senmurv is, in contrary to other patterns, only to meet with figure 4 on the western wall. The reason for that must be the symbolic nature of the Senmurv. Speaking of this creature we concentrate only on the "dogpeackock" as depicted on the Afrasiab murals. Doubtless it originates from Iranian symbolism. The most spectacular examples can be seen on the late Sasanian rock reliefs of Taq-e Bustan (Iran):
Left: Senmurvs as pattern on the caftan of a Sasanian king, Taq-e Bustan, Great Ivan, left wall.
Right: Senmurv in medaillon on the clothes of the heavy-armoured rider, Taq-e Bustan, Geat Ivan. Comparing these images with the Senmurvs from Afrasiab we notice a striking similarity. Apparently the Senmurv in Sasanian iconography was a symbol with intimate connection to



24
kingship. Images concentrate on representations of royal persons and on royal silverware. Only in post-Sasanian times, when dynastic restrictions were lost, the Senmurv spread wide as a merely ornamental motif on Near and Middle Eastern textiles, metalwork, and so on. Concerning the Afrasiab murals we have a general date within the limits of the Sasanian dynasty (i.e., before 652), as we have tried to explain on another page. Therefore, if the Senmurv (i.e., the "dogpeacock"!) was a Sasanian royal emblem, his appearance on the Afrasiab murals should point to the same symbolic value. In other words: The "owner" of the symbol should represent a Sasanian king. http://www.orientarch.uni-halle.de/ca/afras/text/w4b.htm

British Museum. Department: Middle East Registration number: 1922,0308.1 BM/Big number: 124095. Date 7thC-8thC (?) Description Gilded silver plate with low foot-rim and centering mark on the underside; single line engraved around the outside of the rim, with a second engraved line defining the interior; hammered and lathe-turned, then decorated; interior shows a senmurw (a legendary dog-headed bird) facing left, a leaf hanging from its mouth; neck and lower portion of the wing are punched with an imbricated design; the breast is enriched with a foliated motif; the tail feathers are conventionally rendered by punching, the lowest portion concealed by a bold scroll in relief; below the tail, a branch of foliage projects into the field; the



26
foliate border is composed of overlapping leaves, on each of which are punched three divergent stems surmounted by berries in groups of three. Old corrosion attack on part of the underside. Condition of gilding suggests that this is re-gilding. Dimensions : Diameter: 18.8 centimetres (rim)Diameter: 6.8 centimetres (interior, foot-ring)Diameter: 7.3 centimetres (exterior, footring)Height: 3.8 centimetres Volume: 450 millilitresWeight: 541.5 grammes. Hammered gilt silver plate with a low circular foot ring measuring 7.3 cm. across at the base; centering mark and extensive traces of old corrosion attack on the underside; single line engraved around the outside of the rim, with a second engraved line defining the interior. The plate was made by hammering, and decorated through a combination of chasing and punching, with thick gilding over the background. Early published references to the raised portion being embossed separately and added with solder are incorrect, and only the foot ring is soldered on. XRF analysis indicates that the body has a composition of 92% silver, 6.9% copper and 0.45% gold, and the foot has a slightly different composition of 93.4% silver, 5.4% copper and 0.5% gold. The decoration is limited to the interior and shows a composite animal with a dog's head, short erect mane, vertical tufted ears and lion's paws, facing left with a foliate spray dangling from its open mouth like a lolling tongue; a ruff-like circle of hair or fur frames its face; the neck, muscular shoulders and lower tail feathers are punched with an imbricated or overlapping wave design resembling feathers or scales; the breast is enriched with a foliated motif; a pair of wings with forward curling tips rise vertically from behind the shoulders, with a broad rounded peacock-like tail behind decorated with a bold foliate scroll and conventionally rendered by punching; below the tail, a second branch of foliage projects into the field. The foliate border is composed of overlapping leaves, on which are punched three divergent stems surmounted by berries in groups of three. This plate is said to have been obtained in India prior to 1922 when it was purchased in London by the National Art Collections Fund on behalf of the British Museum. It is usually attributed to the 7th, 8th or early 9th century, thus is post-Sasanian, Umayyad or early Abbasid in political terms. Initially described as a hippocamp, peacock-dragon or peacock-griffin, most scholars follow Trever's (1938) identification of this as a senmurw (New Persian simurgh), or Avestan Saena bird (cf. also Schmidt 1980). The iconographic features of a senmurw include the head of a snarling dog, the paws of a lion and the tail of a peacock, with the addition of the plant motifs on the tail or hanging out of the mouth being allusions to its role in regenerating plants. This bird is described in Pahlavi literature as nesting "on the tree without evil and of many seeds" (Menog-i Xrad 61.37-42), and scattering them in the rainy season to encourage future
growth (Bundahišn XVI.4). For this reason it was believed to bestow khwarnah (glory and good fortune), and particularly that of the Kayanids, the legendary ancestors of the Sasanians. This motif is first attested in a datable Sasanian context on the rock-cut grotto of Khusrau II (r. 591628) at Taq-i Bustan, when it appears within embroidered roundels decorating the royal gown. The same motif recurs within a repeating pattern of conjoined pearl roundels depicted on silks from the reliquary of St Lupus and a tomb at Mochtchevaja Balka in the north Caucasus, a pressmoulded glass inlay and vessel appliqué in the Corning Museum of Glass, metalwork, Sogdian murals, and the late Umayyad palace façade at Mshatta (e.g. Harper et al. 1978: 136, no. 60; Trever & Lukonin 1987: 115, pl. 73, no. 26; Overlaet ed. 1993: 270, 275-77, nos 119, 127-28). However, there are significant differences of detail between all of these, and a little caution is necessary before making definite attributions of iconography, date or provenance. Many of the features are also repeated on the depiction of a horned quadruped depicted on a 7th century plate in the Hermitage (Trever & Lukonin 1987: 117-18, pl. 106, no. 36); most recently, Jens Kröger has reiterated the possibility of an early Abbasid date for the present plate, and observed that the



27
distinctive decoration on the tail resembles the split palmette motifs on early Abbasid and Fatimid rock crystal. Source: http://tinyurl.com/7wbzcxgThe heroic theft: myths from Rgveda and the Ancient Near East - David M. Knipe (1967).

"Anzû, also known as dZû and Imdugud Sumerian: 𒀭𒀭𒀭 AN.IM. DUGUDMUŠEN ), is a lesser divinity or monster in several Mesopotamian religions. He was conceived by the pure waters of the Apsu and the wide Earth, or as son of Siris Anzû was depicted as a massive bird who can breathe fire and water, although Anzû is alternately depicted as a lion-headed eagle...The name of the mythological being usually called Anzû was actually written in the oldest Sumerian cuneiform texts as 𒀭𒀭𒀭𒀭 (AN.IM.MIMUŠEN; the cuneiform sign 𒀭, or MUŠEN, in context is an ideogram for "bird"). In texts of the Old Babylonian period, the name is more often found as 𒀭𒀭𒀭𒀭 AN.IM.DUGUDMUŠEN.In 1961, Landsberger argued that this name should be read as "Anzu", and most researchers have followed suit. In 1989, Thokild

Jacobsen noted that the original reading of the cuneiform signs as written (giving the name "dIM.dugud") is also valid, and was probably the original pronunciation of the name, with Anzu derived from an early phonetic variant. Similar phonetic changes happened to parallel terms, such as imdugud (meaning "heavy wind") becoming ansuk. Changes like these occurred by evolution of the im to an (a common phonetic change) and the blending of the new n with the following d, which was aspirated as dh, a sound which was borrowed into Akkadian as z or s....It has also been argued based on contextual evidence and transliterations on cuneiform learning tablets, that the earliest, Sumerian form of the name was at least sometimes also pronounced Zu, and that Anzu is primarily the Akkadian form of the name. However, there is evidence for both readings of the name in both languages, and the issue is confused further by the fact that the prefix 𒀭 (AN) was often used to distinguish deities or even simply high places. AN.ZU could therefore mean simply "heavenly eagle"" (Charles Penglase (4 October 2003). Greek Myths and Mesopotamia: Parallels and Influence in the Homeric Hymns and Hesiod. Taylor &

Section C. Saēna, simorg (Persian), Sēnmurw (Pahlavi), Sīna-Mrū (Pāzand) are cognate with Śyena
Avestan mərəγō saēnō ‘the bird Saēna’, simorg (Persian), Sēnmurw (Pahlavi), Sīna-Mrū
(Pāzand), is a fabulous, mythical bird; etymologically cognate with Śyena of R̥ gveda. "In the Avestan Yašt 14.41 Vərəθraγna, the deity of victory, wraps xvarnah, fortune, round the house of the worshipper, for wealth in cattle, like the great bird Saēna, and as the watery clouds cover the great mountains, which means that Saēna will bring rain...In the Ayādgār-ī Zarērān (Jamasp-Asa I, 12.3) Zarēr’s horse is called sēn-i murwag, possibly because of its strength and swiftness...In the chapter on the classification of animals of the Bundahišn the three-fingered Sēn is called the largest of the birds (13.10), and also the Sēnmurw is of the species of birds (13.22); they are obviously identical. The three-fingered Sēn was created first among the birds, but is not the
chief, a position held by the Karšipt (according to the Indian Bundahišn 24.11 a carg, falcon or hawk), the bird that brought the religion to the enclosure (var) of Jamšēd (cf. Vd. 2.42) (17.11). In 13.34-35 the Sēnmurw has come to the sea Frāxkard (Vourukaša) before all the other
birds...The three-fingered Sēn is the largest bird (Bundahišn 13.10) mentioned among the large birds, side by side with the eagle (āluh) and the lammergeier (dālman); this excludes the falcon, which is much smaller than either of them...In post-Sasanian times the Simorḡ occurs in the epic, folktales, and mystical literature (cf. PLATE I, a medieval representation...The Sēnmurw is very prominent on the coinage of the Hephthalites in the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. It is
distinguished from the standard Sasanian form by having rather a cock’s than a peacock’s tail and also frequently showing reptilian features, which are rare in the Sasanian form...In Modern Armenian paskuč is the griffin vulture (Gyps fulvus). In Georgian sources a p’asgunǰi is described as having a body like that of a lion, head, beak, wings and feet like those of an eagle, and covered in down; some have four legs, some two; it carries off elephants and injures horses; others are like a very large eagle."

Ninurta with his thunderbolts pursues Anzû stealing the Tablet of Destinies from Enlil's sanctuary (Austen Henry Layard Monuments of Nineveh, 2nd Series, 1853)
“On the mountainside Anzu and Ninurta met ... Clouds of death rained down, an arrow flashed lightning. Whizzed the battle force roared between them.“ Anzu Epic, tablet 2,in S. Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia (Oxford - New York, 1989), p. 21. One narration reads: Marduk, sun god of Babylon, with his thunderbolts pursues Anzu after Anzu stole the Tablets of Destiny. Note: The tablets of destiny may be a reference to Indus writing corpora which were veritable stone-, mineral-, metal-ware catalogs. As a researcher on ancient Hindu civilization a contribution was made by me in Journal of IndoJudaic Studies, Vol. 1, Number 11 (2010) -- The Bronze Age Writing System of Sarasvati
Hieroglyphics as Evidenced by Two “Rosetta Stones” By S. Kalyanaraman. The 'rosetta stones' were two pure tin ingots discovered in a shipwreck in Haifa and with Indus writing. The Indus writing on these tin ingots have been read rebus as denoting 'tin' (mineral) which was in demand to be used to alloy with copper to create bronze, thus replacing the naturally-occurring but rare arsenic-copper minerals and heralding a true bronze age.
Marduk, sun god of Babylon, with his thunderbolts pursues Anzu after Anzu stole the Tablets of Destiny. (cf. Marut in Rigveda associated with storms and winds comparable to Anzu or Imdugud associated with storms). Battle between Marduk (Bel) and the Dragon. Drawn from a bas-relief from the Palace of Ashur-nasir-pal, King of Assyria, 885-860 B.C., at Nimrûd. [Nimrûd Gallery, Nos. 28 and 29.]
Marduk is a remembered memory of Indra. Anzu, the eagle is the remembered protector,śyena, the hawk, who brought amśu (anzu) from the heavens to the people working with fire-altars in yajña-s.
According to Louis Renou, the immense Rigvedic collection is present in nuce in the themes related toSoma. Rigveda mentions amśu as a synonym of soma. The possibility of a link with Indus writing corpora which is essentially a catalog of stone-, mineral-, metalware, cannot be ruled out.
George Pinault has found a cognate word in Tocharian, ancu which means 'iron'. I have argued in my book, Indian alchemy, soma in the Veda, that Soma was an allegory, 'electrum' (gold-silver



32
compound). See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2011/10/itihasa-and-eagle-narratives.html for Pinault's views on ancu, amśu concordance.
The link with the Tocharian word is intriguing because Soma was supposed to come from Mt. Mujavant. A cognate of Mujavant is Mustagh Ata of the Himalayan ranges in Kyrgystan.
Is it possible that the ancu of Tocharian from this mountain was indeed Soma?
The referemces to Anzu in ancient Mesopotamian tradition parallels the legends of śyena 'falcon' which is used in Vedic tradition of Soma yajña attested archaeologically in Uttarakhand with a śyenaciti, 'falcon-shaped' fire-altar. http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2011/11/syena-orthography.html śyena, orthography, Sasanian iconography. Continued use of Indus Script hieroglyphs. Comparing the allegory of soma and the legend of Anzu, the bird which stole the tablets of destiny, I posit a hypothesis that the tablets of destiny are paralleled by the Indus writing corpora which constitute a veritable catalog of stone-, mineral- and metal-ware in the bronze age evolving from the chalcolithic phase of what constituted an 'industrial' revolution of ancient times creating ingots of metal alloys and weapons and tools using metal alloys which transformed the relation of communities with nature and resulted in the life-activities of lapidaries transforming into miners, smiths and traders of metal artefacts.
Section D.Soma amśu, products; śyēna, Anzu metaphors; Indus Script hypertexts of metals foundries
https://tinyurl.com/y96qfe36
Abstract. Soma is amśu, is a product deified. Ancu (Tocharian) signifies iron pyrite FeS2 purchased from a seller from Mūjavat. मात्रिक , the fly, betrays Soma. RV 1.119.9. Soma is described -- at an ādibhautika (material) level of analyses -- as a Bronze Age product. Indus Script hypertexts are deciphered as documentation of metal foundries. Mlecchita vikalpa, Indus Script cipher is an alternative representation of reality.
This monograph is organized in two sections:
Section 1. Soma is amśu > ancu, 'iron' (Tocharian) Section 2. Pyrite, iron sulfide biochemistry and origin of life
Some scientists have proposed the role of pyrites in the origin of life suggesting early life formation on the surface of iron sulfide minerals (pyrites). No link is posited between these hypotheses and the allegory of Soma in ancient texts, starting with the R̥ gveda which in a nutshell relates to Soma.
This monograph posits a hypothesis -- at an ādibhautika (material) level of analyses -- that these sacred texts which have survived over 7 millennia have profoundly impacted Bhāratīya Itihāsa.



33
The other three analyses levels of ādidaivika (divine), ādhyātmika (cosmic-life-consciousness receptacle), and turīya (brahman) levels, (circumscribed by dharma-dhamma principles of righteousness), define the very raison d'etre of Bhāratam Janam identified by R̥ ṣi Viśvāmitra in RV 3.53.12.
Section 1. Soma is amśu > ancu, 'iron' (Tocharian)
Soma is a deified pyrite purchased from a seller from Mūjavat.
Soma is amśu.
Soma is an allegory of metalwork with amśu, 'an iron pyrite'. The cognate word is ancu, 'iron' (Tocharian). amśu is linked to wealth in RV
8.5.26: यथोत कृ ेत्व्व्य धनेंशुम् गोष्व गस्त्यम् यथा वाजेषु सोभररम् (RV 8.5.26) Trans. And in like manner as (you protected) Ams'u when wealth was to be bestowed, and Agastya when his cattle (were to be recovered), and Sobhari when food (was to be supplied to him).
Viewed as a Pilgrim's Progress, R̥ gveda is studded with many allegories and narratives which can be interpreted at many levels of comprehension and 'meaning': ādibhautika(material), ādidaivika (divine), ādhyātmika (cosmic-life-consciousness receptacle), and turīya (brahman).
This monogrpah is restricted to the ādibhautika (material) level.
The persons engaged in Soma processing are named in ancient texts. Vīvanhvant, Āthwya, and Thrita (Avesta) are identified -- as remembered ākhyāna narratives -- from the ancient days of R̥ gveda tradition as Vivasvant and Trita Āptya.
Common synonym of Soma is Indu, 'bright drop'. Hieroglyph: इन्िु the point on a die AV. vii ,
109 , 6 Rebus: इन्िु m. ( √ उि् Un2. i , 13 ; probably fr. इि् = √ उि् , " to drop " [cf. /इन्द्र ] ;
perhaps connected with त्रबन्िु , which last is unknown in the ऋग्-वेि BRD. ), Ved. a drop
(especially of सोम) , सोमRV. AV. VS.; a bright drop , a spark TS.; the weight of a silver पल, L.; a coin (Monier-Williams) In Indus Script Corpora, 'drop' is orthographed as the dot-in-a-circle hypertext to signify a synonym: dhāī f. ʻ wisp of fibres added from time to time to a rope that is being twisted ʼ (Sindhi); dhāˊtu ʻ *strand of rope ʼ (R̥ gveda)(CDIAL 6773) rebus: dhāū, dhāv 'red stone minerals'; dhā̆ vaḍ m. ʻa caste of iron-smeltersʼ, dhāvḍī ʻcomposed of or relating to ironʼ. Alternative: dāya 'Number one in the game of dice' rebus: dhāū, dhāv, dhāˊtu 'red stone minerals'.
The drop comes from Soma pressed, pounded with adri, grāvan, 'stones' which lie on a skin. Avestan tradition uses mortar and pestle to press Haoma.
The drop is strained through a sieve which is a skin, hair, wool, filter. The flow of the drop becomes Pavamāna. R̥ gveda prays to divinity Soma Pavamāna 'Purified Soma' in 120 hymns. An entire Yasht of Avesta is devoted to Haoma.

आ-त्रशर् are milk, fresh or curdled, and barley mixed with Soma to purify it. (RV. AV. TS. Ka1tyS3r. &c) Waters are mixed with Soma. Soma is the sharp-horned bull. Soma gives immortality to both divinities and human beings. Soma inspires speech. Soma is the bolt for Indra. Soma rides in a chariot with Indra and is connected with the Maruts. The votary declares: RV 8.48.3 Griffith translation:
a ápāma sómam amŕtā abhūmâganma jyótir ávidāma devân c kíṃ nūnám asmân kṛṇavad árātiḥ kím u dhūrtír amṛta mártyasya
We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the light, the Gods discovered.Now what may foemans' malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortal man's deception?
This is clearly a metaphorical statement and DOES NOT identify Soma as a juice. For, the Chandogya Upanishad is emphatic.
I suggest that references in R̥ gveda related to Soma are metaphorical expressions of 'drink' in Chandas (Vedic Samskrtam), while the product processed results in a molten state.
I submit that such references do NOT constitute a direct reference to a herbal fluid or juice or any edible material.
Louis Renous noted: R̥ gveda is Soma in nuce (Soma in a nut). Identification of Soma as a product so vividly enunciated in Vedic texts is of fundamental importance so as not to misinterpret the sacred texts.
The Chandogya in 8 chapters is Vedantic philosophy.
esha somo rājā devānam annam tam devā bhakṣayanti: "That soma is king; this is the devas' food. The devas eat it." [Chandogya.Upanishad (Ch.Up.)]
This is the clearest statement that references to or attributes of Soma in the Vedic tradition, right from the R̥ gveda, should be viewed as metaphors. Even when Agni or ghee or Soma are viewed as products, the emphatic statement is that Soma is NOT for human digestion or consumption but associated with divinities, digested by the divinities (deva bhakshyanti) -- not by mortals or worshippers in the sacred yajna.
It will thus be an error to interpret Soma as an edible product. Such interpretations that Soma is a



35
hallucinogen or an inebriant are not sanctioned by tradition. If at all there is a refrain metaphor, it relates to processing of Soma to generate or obtain wealth.
There may be some questions raised based on received wisdom that translations refer to expressions of 'drinking' soma.
Here for example are two references from R̥ gveda: RV 8.48.3 nd RV 8.91.1-7
[08-048] HYMN XLVIII. Soma. 1. WISELY have I enjoyed the savoury viand, religiousthoughted, best to find out treasure, The food to which all Deities and mortals, calling it meath, gather themselves together. <337> 2 Tlou shalt be Aditi as thou hast entered within, appeaser of celestial anger. Indu, enjoying Indra's friendship, bring us - as a swift steed the car - forward to riches. 3 We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the light, the Gods discovered. Now what may foeman's malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortal man's deception?
Griffith Translation RV 8.91.1-7



36
1. DOWN to the stream a maiden came, and found the Soma by the way. Bearing it to her home she said, For Indra will I press thee out, for Sakra will I press thee out. 2 Thou roaming yonder, little man, beholding every house in turn, Drink thou this Soma pressed with teeth, accompanied with grain and curds, with cake of meal and song of praise. 3 Fain would we learn to know thee well, nor yet can we attain to thee. Still slowly and in gradual drops, O Indu, unto Indra flow. 4 Will he not help and work for us? Will he not make us wealthier? Shall we not, hostile to our lord, unite ourselves to Indra now? 5 O Indra, cause to sprout again three places, these which I declare,- My father's head, his cultured field, and this the part below my waist. 6 Make all of these grow crops of hair, you cultivated field of ours, My body, and my father's head. 7 Cleansing Apala, Indra! thrice, thou gavest sunlike skin to her, Drawn, Satakratu! through the hole of car, of wagon, and of yoke.
apAma may also mean 'obtained'. Here:
आप 1 [p= 142,2] m. obtaining mfn. ifc. to be obtained (cf. िुर् °).n. (fr. 2. अप् Pa1n2. 4-2 , 37), a
quantity of water , मन्दिनाथ on S3is3. iii , 72. Thus, the translation of apAma 'we drank' is of doubtful validity.
Apala episode is beautiful. What she found was a stone with traces of soma (electrum, gold/silver compound as assem (Egyptian), noted by Joseph Needham).
In RV 8.48.3 'We have drunk...'? Amrutam is a metaphor. It means, we have obtained the Soma, amrutam (wealth).
This is what Winslow's Tamil lexicon says: soma maNal 'sand containing silver ore'.

RV 1.154.2 and 1.155.1 notes that Viṣṇu is girikṣit 'mountain-dwelling'. giriṣṭha 'mountain

mahāv ̥rṣa-s, the gandhāri-s, and the bāhika-s, in the Atharvaveda (v.22,5.7.9.1). This is consistent with a statement that Soma is found in the upper Indus and Kashmir region (Susruta Samhita: 537-538, SS.CS. 29.28-31). Avesta declares that Haoma grows in the mountains. Clearly, Soma is a product from the mountains.

I guided forth the loudlyroaring- waters, and the Gods moved according to my pleasure. 3 In the wild joy of Soma I demolished Sambaras' forts, ninetyandnine—, together; And, utterly, the hundredth habitation, when helping Divodasa Atithigva. 4 Before all birds be ranked this Bird, O Maruts; supreme of falcons be this fleetwinged- Falcon, Because, strong- pinioned, with no car to bear him, he brought to Manu the Godloved oblation. 5 When the Bird brought it, hence in rapid motion sent on the wide path fleet as thought he hurried. Swift he returned with sweetness of the Soma, and hence the Falcon hath acquired his glory. 6 Bearing the stalk, the Falcon speeding onward, Bird bringing from afar the draught that gladdens, Friend of the Gods, brought, grasping fast, the Soma which be bad taken from yon loftiest heaven. 7 The Falcon took and brought the Soma, bearing thousand libations with him, yea, ten thousand.

1. I, As I lay within the womb, considered all generations of these Gods in order. A hundred iron fortresses confined me but forth I flew with rapid speed a Falcon. 2 Not at his own free pleasure did he bear me: he conquered with his strength and manly courage. Straightway the Bold One left the fiends behind him and passed the winds as he grew yet more mighty. 3 When with loud cry from heaven down sped the Falcon, thence hasting like the wind he bore the Bold One. Then, wildly raging in his mind, the archer Krsanu aimed and loosed the string to strike him. 4 The Falcon bore him from heavens' lofty summit as the swift car of Indras' Friend bore Bhujyu. Then downward hither fell a flying feather of the Bird hasting forward in his journey. 5 And now let Maghavan accept the beaker, white, filled with milk, filled with the shining liquid; The best of sweet meath which the priests have offered: that Indra to his joy may drink, the Hero, that he may take and drink it to his rapture.
Riddles in R̥ gveda Sukta 1.164 as relatable to Pravargya by Jan EM Houben. (The ritual pragmatics of a Vedic hymn: The 'riddle hymn' and the Pravargya ritual by Jan EM Houben, 2000, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 120 (4), pp. 499-536.) Jan EM Houben indicates the possibility that the riddle in R̥ gveda Sukta 1.164 is explained as a metaphor of three birds, one of which is Suparna (garumat); the second a bird eating a sweet fig in a tree. The third bird is Patanga. The author of RV 10.177 is Rishi Patanga Prajapati and RV 10.177 is the same as RV 1.164.31. I suggest that the three birds in the Sukta RV 1.164 referred to by Houben are: śyēna, patanga, mākṣikā: · śyēna is suprana (garutmat), falcon · mākṣikā is the pippalam sva_du atti: 'the flying bee which eats the sweet fig' (RV 1.164.20) · patanga is the third bird, flying insect (RV 10.177) The three flying birds (insects) are rebusmetonymy renderings as hieroglyphs signifying metalwork catalogues in archaeometallurgical transactions of Bhāratam Janam, 'metalcaster folk'
patanga, mercury or quicksilver in transmuting metal (Soma, ams'u);
mākṣikā, pyrites (which are to be oxidised to attain purified pavamAna Soma, electrum as goldsilver compound). Hieroglyph: मात्रिक [p= 805,2] mfn. (fr. मत्रिका ) coming from or belonging to
a bee Ma1rkP.; n. (scil. मधु) honey Var. Sus3r.; Rebus: n. a kind of honey-like mineral substance or pyrites MBh.
śyēna, anzu, ams'u (electrum ore filaments in the pyrites).
Reinterpreting Mayabheda Sukta of R̥ gveda (RV 10.177) The metaphor of the 'thunderbolt' is depicted as Anzu bird [cognate:asaṇi 'thunderbolt' (Prakritam)] carrying away the tablets of destiny in Mesopotamian legends. A phonemic variant śyēna, 'falcon' gets deified, immortalized as śyēnaciti 'falcon-shaped fire-altar' in Vedic tradition in Bharatam. This is mərəγō saēnō ‘the bird Saēna’ in Avestan. (See article on Simorg in Encyclopaedia Iranica. http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/simorg The cognate expression in Samsk ̥rtam is śyēna m̥rga).

Three intriguing references to Soma in the R̥ gveda:

45
1. Mortals do not taste Soma. RV 10.85.3, 4 which suggest that Brahmana and those who dwell on earth do NOT partake of Soma. Similar refrain occurs in Atharva Veda. Hillebrandt and Oldenburg suggest that Soma is a metahpor for the sun or moon. 2. मात्रिक , the fly, betrays Soma. RV 1.119.9 There is a pun on the word मात्रिक which also signifies 'pyrites' (secondary ores). Rigveda citation:

The references to Saēna’ in Avestan cognate śyēna m ̥rga (Samsk ̥rtam) find many representations on Indus Script hypertexts, at times referring to the bird as Anzu (a memory-recall of amśu 'Soma' > ancu 'iron' (Tocharian).

A lion-headed (eagle-like) bird of prey on the bison’s back--the mythical anzû--bites its haunch.
[quote] The bison’s body is in profile, its face forward. The stylization of the animal’s shoulder as an undulating band and the inward-curving tufts of hair on the fetlocks are typical of the late Early Dynastic period. The three overlapping semi-circles that form the rocky outcropping or mountain are reminiscent of the cuneiform sign signifying both mountain and foreign land and



48
suggestive of a natural setting for the action depicted in the distant highlands. The lion-headed bird of prey’s folded wings, neck and tail are rendered with a grid of incised lines.
The square plaque described here is from Woolley’s 1923-24 excavations in front of Tell alUbaid’s late Early Dynastic temple platform (see INTRODUCTION: Tell al-Ubaid). Woolley
focused his efforts on the northwest side of the central stair ramp. The plaque was relatively high in the mudbrick debris from the collapse of the platform’s superstructure and in close proximity to an inlay panel depicting milking scenes and rows of cattle. In fact, B15606 was just under and against a section of the frieze with shell figures of five bulls facing right and may have originally been attached to it. With the plaque (but detached from it), were the remains of a copper border similar to that of the inlay panels. The background of the plaque had been painted black to match the dark color of the bituminous limestone background of the inlay panels. The human-faced bison, Sumerian (gud) alim or Akkadian kusarikku, is associated with the sungod Utu/Shamash, perhaps in part because it inhabited the eastern mountains from which the sun rose. An Akkadian cylinder seal from Susa in fact depicts the sun god rising above two addorsed recumbent human-faced bisons in place of the stylized mountains that normally mark his abode. And in a hymn the sun god is likened to a bison, “ Lord, bison, striding over the mountain, Utu, bison, striding over the mountain.”
The mythical anzû, who nests in the high mountains, is a seemingly benevolent creature, at least in early texts and imagery. For example, in the mythical narrative Lugalbanda and the Anzû bird, composed in the late 3rd millennium BCE, when the anzû-bird returned from hunting to
find his nest embellished like a god’s dwelling, with his chick adorned and fed, the anzû exulted in his own role as intermediary to Enlil I am the prince who decides the destiny of rolling rivers. I keep on the straight and narrow path the righteous who follow Enlil's counsel. My father Enlil brought me here. He let me bar the entrance to the mountains as if with a great door. If I fix a fate, who shall alter it? If I but say the word, who shall change it? Whoever has done this to my nest, if you are a god, I will speak with you, indeed I will befriend you. If you are a man, I will fix your fate. I shall not let you have any opponents in the mountains. You shall be 'Hero-fortified-by-Anzû'.
Anzû was Enlil’s symbol, and depictions of the anzû with wings outstretched over antithetical animals symbolic of other deities probably reflects Enlil’s all-encompassing power. The anzû relief from Tell al-Ubaid, then, would depict Enlil over the stags associated with Ninhursag. Anzû’s close association with Ningirsu, Enlil’s son and warrior and Lagash’s tutelary deity, is evident at Tello (Girsu), both in texts and imagery in Early Dynastic-Ur III periods. On
Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures, for example, Ningirsu’s battle net is held closed by the anzû and antithetical lions, Ningursu’s animals, while a macehead, currently in the British Museum (BM 23287), dedicated to Ningirsu for the life of Enannatum shows the anzû grasping lions. In
Gudea’s Cylinders Ningirsu’s temple Eninnu had the epithet “white anzû,” perhaps a reference to some significant architectural embellishment such as Urnamma affixed to the gates of Enlil’s Ekur. But the anzû was a complex creature and one portrayed as more troublesome in later literary compositions. The Epic of Anzû, which exists in copies dating to the early 2nd millennium BCE, tells the tale of a malevolent anzû who steals the “tablet of destinies” and is eventually slain by Ninurta. Though Akkadian seals, showing a bird-man brought before Enki, may depict excerpts from this story, suggesting that at least in certain traditions the anzû was thought of as a creature with a dual—benevolent and malevolent--character already at the end of the 3rd millennium BCE, their reading remains a matter of controversy.



49
Whatever the complexity of the mythology regarding the anzû, the imagery of B15606, on which the anzû is shown in overtly aggressive behavior toward an animal of the mountains, associated with the sun god, remains perplexing. Similar scenes occur on shell inlays from Tello and Ur, as well as Tell Mardikh (Ebla) in western Syria. For example, one end panel of the Royal Standard of Ur shows the anzû attacking recumbent human-faced bisons on each side of a mountain from which a plant grows. Such scenes may reflect the menacing behavior of the anzû to men and gods, but more likely depict the anzû’s normal behavior in its natural habitat. B15606’s
juxtaposition with scenes of herding and milking cattle, then, could be read as contrasting the settled conditions of a “civilized” floodplain with life in the mountains, where, as Lugalanda and the Anzû describes, bulls ran wild and the anzû hunted to feed its offspring.

Copper friezeImdugud (also Zu or Anzu), the lion-headed eagle; Sumerian metalwork (sheets of copper), Temple of Ninhursag at Tell al-'Ubaid; ca. 2500 BCE http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Imdugud.jpg. From the temple of Ninhursag, Tell al-'Ubaid, southern Iraq
Pendant of gold and lapis lazuli.
About 2600-2400 BCE A rare metalwork survival
[quote] This relief was one of a group of objects found at the small site of Tell al-'Ubaid, close to the remains of the city of Ur. It was discovered at the base of a mud-brick platform on which had been built a temple dedicated to the goddess Ninhursag.



53
The frieze may have originally stood above the door of the temple, and if so, is the most striking element of what survives of the temple façade. The frieze was badly damaged when it was found. Only one stag's head was recovered intact and the head of the eagle had to be restored. This restoration, based on images of similar date, shows the lion-headed eagle Imdugud, the symbol of the god Ningirsu. The artist has allowed the lion head to break out of the confines of the framework, suggesting Imdugud's great power. The relief is formed from sheets of copper alloy beaten into shape and fastened, with pins and twisted lengths of copper, to a wooden core coated with bitumen. The survival of such a large piece of metalwork from this period is exceptional. Though copper, probably from the regions of modern Oman and Iran, was the most widely-used metal at this time, most metal objects have either disintegrated or the metal was melted down and re-used.

Tripod silver vase of Enmetena, dedicated to the war god Ningirsu. The legs are made of copper. The vase features an image of Anzud, the lion-headed eagle, grasping two lions with his talons.
The image of Anzud shows up better in this old photograph. Anzud (also known as Imdugud) was the symbolic animal of Ningirsu. The image of Anzud with the two lions seems to be symbolic of the city of Lagash.

Translation of the inscriptions from the CDLI (P222539):
For Ningirsu, the hero of Enlil, Enmetena, ruler of Lagash, chosen by the heart of Nanshe, chief ruler of Ningirsu, son of Enannatum, ruler of Lagash, for the king who loved him, Ningirsu, (this) gurgur-vessel of refined silver, from which Ningirsu will consume the monthly oil (offering), he had fashioned for him. For his life, before Ningirsu of the Eninnu (temple) he had it set up. At that time Dudu was the temple administrator of Ningirsu. http://sumerianshakespeare.com/70701/74901.html

Terracotta plaque showing a bull-man holding a post
Old Babylonian, about 2000-1600 BCE From Mesopotamia Length: 12.800 cm Width: 7.000 cm ME 103225 Room 56: Mesopotamia This plaque depicts a creature with the head and torso of a human but the horns, lower body and legs of a bull. Though similar figures are depicted earlier in Iran, they are first seen in Mesopotamian art around 2500 BC, most commonly on cylinder seals, and are associated with the sun-god Shamash. The bull-man was usually shown in profile, with a single visible horn projecting forward. However, here he is depicted in a less common form; his whole body above the waist, shown in frontal view, shows that he was intended to be double-horned. He may be supporting a divine emblem and thus acting as a protective deity. Baked clay plaques like this were mass-produced using moulds in southern Mesopotamia from the second millennium BC. While many show informal scenes and reflect the private face of life, this example clearly has magical or religious significance. British Museum, A guide to the Babylonian and, 3rd ed.

Base for a ritual offering, carved with animals Elamite period, mid-3rd millennium BCE
Tell of the Acropolis, Susa, Iran Bituminous rock H. 19 cm; Diam. 11 cm Jacques de Morgan excavations, 1908 Lions and gazelles passant; eagles protecting their young Sb 2725 This base for a ritual offering is made of bitumen. This material was plentiful throughout the Middle East, but only in Susa was it used in sculpture. The object is carved with big cats, gazelles, and eagles. The theme of the eagle spreading its wings to protect its young was found only in Iran and also features on painted ceramics of the same period. Bitumen: a plentiful material used in an unusual manner This object in the form of a truncated cone is a base for a ritual offering. It is carved from bituminous rock, found throughout the region but used in sculpture only in Susa. It was used to make vases similar to this object (Louvre, Sb2726), and later, in the early years of the 2nd millennium BC, vases carved with bas-relief decorations and an animal's head in high relief (Louvre, Sb2740). The shape of this object - a truncated cone - is similar to other pieces made of chlorite and dating from the same period. The mortise at the top of the cone and the unfinished lip suggest that the object originally had a second part that fitted on top of the cone. However, the precise purpose of the object remains a mystery. The animal carvings The cone is carved with two registers separated by a narrow strip. The upper register is decorated with two gazelles calmly grazing on vegetation, represented by stalks between each animal. Alongside the two gazelles are two big cats, almost certainly lions, with their backs to each other. Their stylized manes are shown as vertical strips, reminiscent of those of the woolen Mesopotamian garments known as kaunakes. Their tails are raised horizontally over their backs, similar to depictions of lions on cylinders from Uruk or Susa. Their heads are depicted in geometrical form. All four animals are shown in profile. The artistic desire to create a scene and a landscape imbued with life is also evident in two cylinders from Uruk and Khafaje. The lower register shows two highly stylized eagles, upright, as if resting on their tail feathers. Their wings and talons are spread to protect the chicks beneath them. These eagles differ somewhat from the usual representation of eagles as the attribute of the Sumerian god Ningirsu, where the birds are depicted with a lion's head, holding two lion cubs, which are shown face on. Mythological creatures or carvings of local wildlife? Eagles were a major theme in Susian and Mesopotamian art. This depiction of an eagle resting on its tail feathers is also found in ceramics, glyptics, and perforated plaques dating from the 3rd millennium BC. However, unlike Mesopotamian eagles, Susian eagles never resembled



64
composite animals. Likewise, Mesopotamian eagles had a mythological dimension, which was absent from Susian portrayals of the bird. In Susa, eagles were simply considered ordinary birds of prey.

Sumer of Anzu, the eagle is compared with śyena-amśu (soma) of Rigveda. Similarities are
striking indeed and should provide a pause to an understanding of the bronze-age recorded in the many metaphors and hieroglyphs (such as the overflowing vase of Gudea, discussed in http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2013/06/ancient-near-east-indus-writing-lokhad.html
Ancient near East Gudea statue hieroglyph (Indus writing): lokhãḍ, 'copper tools, pots and pans' Rebus: lo 'overflow', kāṇḍa 'sacred water'.
The parallels of metaphors/imageries are so vivid that a relationships between the people who narrated the exploits of heroes of Sumer and the exploits of Indra narrated in the Rigveda have to be deep indeed and cannot be explained away as mere coincidences.
Anzu stole the tablet of destinies. Śyena of Rigveda brought the amśu (soma) from the heavens. Anzu is derived from An "heaven" and Zu "to know", in Sumerian language. See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2011/09/decipherment-of-soma-and-ancientindo.html Soma-haoma, *sauma ? somnakay ! samanom ! *haeusom
French scholar, Prof. Pinault identifies amśu of Rigveda with anzu of Tocharian. In Tocharian it means 'iron'. Tocharin language as an Indo-European language has revealed a word anzu in Tocharian which meant 'iron'. It is likely that this is the word used for soma in Rigveda. The
imagery of an eagle stealing soma also occurs in ancient Indian texts. There is a hymn to śyena in Atharvaveda (7.41).
A synonym of soma is amśu. śyena, the hawk has brought the soma from the heaven.

5.044.11 Swift is the excessive and girth-distending inebriation of Viśvavārā, Yajata and Māyin; (by partaking) of these (juices) they urge one another to drink; they find the copious draught the prompt giver of intoxication. [Swift is...inebriation: śyena āsām aditih kakṣyo madah: śyena = śīghra, quick; aditi = atisamṛddhah; āsām = of these, Soma juices; mada = intoxication, is the devata_ of the verse].

Vāmadevagautama sings the following rca-s for śyena:
प्र सु श त्रवभ्यो मरुतो त्रवरुस्त प्र ेश्यनः ेश्यनेभ्य आशुपत्वा अचक्रया यात स्वधया सुपणो हंव्य भरन्मनवे िेवजुंष्ट (RV 4.26.4) 4.26.4 May this bird, Maruts, be pre-eminent over (other) hawks, since with a wheelless car the swift-winged bore the Soma, accepted by the gods, to Manu. [With a wheelless car: acakrayā vadhayā = cakrarahitena rathena, with a car without wheels; the text has havyam, this is a metonymy for the Soma, which is said to have been brought from heaven by the gāyatrī, in the form of a hawk; by the hawk, we are to understand the supreme spirit, parabrahma]. Alternative: Before you measure this falcon, O Maruts, supreme is this swift-winged Shyena, strongly self-possessed with no one to bear him, That One brought to Manu the wholesome offerings.Explanation: It is impossible to measure the comprehensive energy existing in That One, who as swift-moving falcon envelops and pervades far distant places. In earlier days Manu, who was effulgent with Bliss, the essence of That One, was provided with wholesome offerings. Seer seems to suggest that even as Manu earlier, with whom he has established companionship, he too now should be the beneficiary of the choice offerings.
भरत्रद्यि त्रवरतो वेत्रवजानः पथोरुणा मनोजवा असत्रजु तूयं ययौ मधुना सोेम्यनोत श्रवो त्रवत्रविे ेश्यनो RV 4.26.5 4.26.5 When the bird, intimidating (its guardians), carried off from hence (the Soma) it was at large; (flying) swift as thought along the vast path (of the firmament), it went rapidly with the sweet Soma, and the hawks thence acquired the celebrity in this world. Alternative: When the bird brought in rapid movements and sent the swift thoughts on widespread Path, the same were returned with sweetness of Bliss, the Falcon in that process attaining brilliance. Explanation: Bird is the energy that elevates the thought fastest moving in universe, with swiftness of a falcon, unless it is with difficulty restrained. The thoughts imbibe the bliss of That One, the falcon, in that process shining with resplendence.
ऋजीपी ेश्यनो ििमानो अुम्पम्शरावतः शकु नो मंन्द्र मिं सोमं भरद्दादृहाणो िेवावान्दिवो अमुश्मा िुद्दरािआ िाय RV 4.26.6 4.26.6 The straight-flying hawk, conveying the Soma from afar; the bird, attended by the gods, brought, resolute of purpose, the adorable exhilarating Soma, having taken it from that lofty heaven. Alternative: Climbing above holding the thought and the bird bringing the draught that gladdens, the Falcon spreads upward. Comrade of the luminous beings clutching Soma which the birds had brought it rises to the loftiest heavens. Explanation: Noble thoughts elevate the soul upward and ignoble ones relegate it downward. As the thoughts become energetic with bliss brought by birds from the heavens, the falcon takes elevates them thus enriched with the Bliss of Beatitude, the loftiest of heavens.
आिाय ेश्यनो अभारत्सोमं सहंस्र सवा अयुतं च साकं अिा पुरन्दन्धरजहाि अरातीर मिे सोमस्य मूरा अमूरः R V 4.26.7 4.26.7 Having taken it, the hawk brought the Soma with him to a thousand and ten thousand sacrifices, and this being provided, the performer of many (great) deeds, the unbewildered (Indra) destroyed, in the exhilaration of the Soma, (his) bewildered foes.



66
Alternative: Providing Soma bearing thousand libations, yes, ten thousand libations Shyena the falcon bringing it from above offers it down here on earth. Therein, the courageous ones leave all the malignant ones behind, the wise with wild ecstasy, leaving the unwise far behind.Explanation: That One, the falcon brings luminous libations from above and offers them here down below to those who deserve. The enlightened bold ones leave the malignant ones far behind, wise becomes wild with abundance and the timid sinking in scarcity. [Source for the alternative renderings of 4.26.4 to 7: http://nageshsonde.com/Rigveda_A_Study_on_Forty_Hymns.pdf] Vāmadevagautama continues the prayer to śyena in the next Sūkta:
गभे नु सेन्वन्नषां अवेिं अहं िेवानां जत्रनमात्रन त्रवश्वा शतं मा पूर आयासीरारािन्नध ेश्यनो जवसा त्रनरिीयं RV 4.27.1 4.27.1 Being still in the germ, I have known all the births of these divinities in their order; a hundred bodies of metal confined me, but as a hawk I came forth with speed. [i.e., until the sage comprehended the differences between the body and soul, and learned that soul was unconfined, he was subject to repeated births; but in this stage he acquired divine knowledge, and burst
through the bonds with the force and celerity of a hawk from its nest; Vāmadevaśyena rūpam āsthāya garbhād yogena nihsṛtah = Vāmadeva, having assumed the form of a hawk, came forth from the womb by the power of Yoga (Nītimañjari)].
न घा स मां अप जोषं जभाराभी ं आस त्विसा वीयेण ईमाु पुरं त्रधरआजहािरातीरुत वाता अत ूरच्छ शुवानः RV 4.27.2 4.27.2 That embryo did not beguile me into satisfaction, but by the keen energy (of divine wisdom), I triumphed over it; the impeller of all, the sustainer of many, abandoned the foes (of knowledge), and, expanding, passed beyond the winds (of worldly troubles). [The impeller of all: the paramātmā, or supreme spirit; beyond the winds: the vital airs, or life, the cause of worldly existence, which is pain].
अव यच्प्येनो अस्वनीिध द्योत्रवु यि् यत्रि वात ऊहः पुरंन्दन्ध सुजद्यिस्मा अव हा त्रिपज्ज्ां कु शानुरस्ता मनसा भरण्यन् RV 4.27.3 4.27.3 When the hawk screamed (with exultation) on his descent from heaven, and (the guardians of the Soma) perceived that the Soma was (carried away) by it then, the archer of Kṛśānu, pursuing with the speed of thought, and stringing his bow, let fly an arrow against it. [Note: śankha Kṛśānu is a conch-shell cutter.]
ऋत्रजप्य ईं इन्द्रावतो न भुुज्यम ेश्यनो जभार बृहतो अत्रध ष्णोः अन्तः पतत्पतत्र्यस्य पणं अध यामत्रन प्रत्रसतस्य तेद्ः RV 4.27.4
4.27.4 The straight-flying hawk carried off the Soma from above the vast heaven, as (the Aśvins carried off) Bhujyu from the region of Indra, and a falling feather from the middle of the bird dropped from him wounded in the conflict. [antah parṇam tan madhye sthitam; one nail of the left foot and the shaft was broken by the collision, the fragments of the nail became the quills of the fretful porcupine, those of the arrow, water-snakes, flying foxes, and worms].
अध ेश्वतं कलशं गोत्रभरं आत्रपप्यानं मघवा शुक्रमन्धः अध्वयुत्रभः प्रयातं मध्वो अग्रम इन्द्रो मिाय प्रन्दत्पबैध्य शूरो मिाय प्रत्रत धन्दत्पबैध्य RV 4.27.5
4.027.05 Now may Maghavan accept the pure nutritious (sacrificial) food in a white pitcher, mixed with milk and curds, offered by the priests; the upper part of the sweet (beverage) to drink for his exhilaration; may the hero accept (it) to drink for (his) exhilaration.

67
4.18.13 In extreme destitution I have cooked the entrails of a dog; I have not found a comforter among the gods; I have beheld my wife disrsepected; then the falcon, (Indra), has brought to me sweet water. [In extreme destitutuin: So Manu has, Vāmadeva, who well knew right and wrong, was by no means rendered impure, though desirous when oppressed with hunger, of eating the flesh of dogs for the preservation of his life; icchan attum, wishing to eat; the text has śuno āntrāṇi pece, I cooked the entrails of a dog; the falcon: i.e., as swift as a hawk, śyena vat śīghragāmīndrah]. [Sūkta 18: Ṛṣi vāmadeva, while yet in the womb, was reluctant to be born and chose to come into the world through his mother's side; aware of his purpose, the mother prayed to Aditi, who thereupon came, with her son Indra, to expostulate with the Ṛṣi; this is the subject of the Sūkta]. The Sūkta's of Ṛṣi vāmadeva are brilliant evocations of the deeds of Indra, the thunder-bolt wielder and repeatedly evoke the memories enshrined in the Sumerian relief sculptures. नवं नु स्तोमं अग्नये त्रिवः ेश्यनाय जीजनं वस्वः क त्रवि वनात्रत नः RV 7.15.4
7.15.4 May Agni, to whom as to a (swift) hawk in heaven, I address this new hymn, bestow upon us ample wealth. Alternative: 1 have begotten this new hymn for Agni, falcon of the Sky: will he not give us of his wealth? (Griffith trans.)(Note: "As mediator between the realms of men and of the gods, the characteristics of flight are often Agni's. As divine eagle or falcon (śyena) he is depicted in the Agnicayana (Yajur Veda), the ritual construction of a 10,800 brick fire-altar in the form of a flying bird. The iron fort with a hundred walls in stanza 14 below perhaps recalls the eagle's soma-theft in Rig Veda, IV, 26 and 27."
[quote]Zu, also known as Anzu and Imdugud, in Sumerian, (from An "heaven" and Zu "to know", in the Sumerian language) is a lesser divinity of Akkadian mythology, and the son of the bird goddess Siris. He was conceived by the pure waters of the Apsu and the wide Earth.[1] Both Zu and Siris are seen as massive birds who can breathe fire and water, although Zu is alternately seen as a lion-headed eagle (cf: The Griffin). Zu as a lion-headed eagle, ca. 2550–2500 BC, Louvre Anzu was a servant of the chief sky god Enlil, guard of the throne in Enlil's sanctuary, (possibly previously a symbol of Anu), from whom Anzu stole the Tablet of Destinies, so hoping to determine the fate of all things. In one version of the legend, the gods sent Lugalbanda to retrieve the tablets, who in turn, killed Anzu. In another, Ea and Belet-Ili conceived Ninurta for the purpose of retrieving the tablets. In a third legend, found in The Hymn of Ashurbanipal, Marduk is said to have killed Anzu. [unquote] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_(mythology) See: http://www.sacredtexts.com/ane/blc/blc08.htm
[quote] In Mesopotamian mythology, the Tablet of Destinies - Dup Shimati in Sumerian - (not, as frequently misquoted in general works, the 'Tablets of Destinies') was envisaged as a clay tablet inscribed with cuneiform writing, also impressed with cylinder seals, which, as a permanent legal document, conferred upon the god Enlil his supreme authority as ruler of the universe. In the Sumerian poem 'Ninurta and the Turtle' it is the god Enki, rather than Enlil, who holds the tablet. Both this poem and the Akkadian Anzû poem share concern of the theft of the tablet by the bird Imdugud (Sumerian) or Anzû (Akkadian). Supposedly, whoever possessed the tablet ruled the universe.In the Babylonian Enuma Elish, Tiamat bestows this tablet on Qingu (in some instances spelled "Kingu") and gives him command of her army. Marduk, the chosen champion of the gods, then fights and destroys Tiamat and her army. Marduk reclaims the Tablet of Destinies for himself, thereby strengthening his rule among the gods.The tablet can be

Section 2. Pyrite, iron sulfidebiochemistry and origin of life
"The iron–sulfur world hypothesis is a set of proposals for the origin of life and the early evolution of life advanced in a series of articles between 1988 and 1992 by Günter Wächtershäuser, a Munich patent lawyer with a degree in chemistry, who had been encouraged and supported by philosopher Karl R. Popper to publish his ideas. The hypothesis proposes that early life may have formed on the surface of iron sulfide minerals, hence the name. Pioneer organism. Wächtershäuser proposes that the earliest form of life, termed "pioneer organism", originated in a volcanic hydrothermal flow at high pressure and high (100 °C) temperature. It had a composite structure of a mineral base with catalytic transition metal centers (predominantly iron and nickel, but also perhaps cobalt, manganese, tungsten and zinc). The catalytic centers catalyzed autotrophic carbon fixation pathways generating small molecule (nonpolymer) organic compounds from inorganic gases (e.g. carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide). These organic compounds were retained on or in the mineral base as organic ligands of the transition metal centers with a flow retention time in correspondence with their mineral bonding strength thereby defining an autocatalytic "surface metabolism". The catalytic transition metal centers became autocatalytic by being accelerated by their organic products turned ligands. The carbon fixation metabolism became autocatalytic by forming a metabolic cycle in the form of a primitive sulfur-dependent version of the reductive citric acid cycle. Accelerated catalysts expanded the metabolism and new metabolic products further accelerated the catalysts. The idea is that once such a primitive autocatalytic metabolism was established, its intrinsically synthetic chemistry began to produce ever more complex organic compounds, ever more complex pathways and ever more complex catalytic centers..Nutrient conversions. The water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) occurs in volcanic fluids with diverse catalysts or without catalysts.The combination of ferrous sulfide and hydrogen sulfide as reducing agents in conjunction with pyrite formation – FeS + H2S → FeS2 + 2H+ + 2e− (or H2 instead of 2H+ + 2e−) – has been demonstrated under mild volcanic conditions.This key result has been disputed."

"Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of fool's gold. The color has also led to the nicknames brass, brazzle, and Brazil, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal. The

And, in his battles, Sobhari. 27 For so much bliss, or even more, O Asvins, Wealthy Gods, than this, We pray white singing hymns to you. 28 Ascend your car with golden seat, O Asvins, and with reins of gold, That reaches even to the sky. 29 Golden is its supporting shaft, the axle also is of gold, And both the wheels are made of gold. 30 Thereon, ye Lords of ample wealth, come to us even from afar, Come ye to this mine eulogy.

I suggest tht the descriptive expression ayojālāni 'nets of iron' in Rāmāyaṇa araṇya kāṇḍa 3.35.35 in reference to amṝtam is a semantic determinant of Soma as a divine metaphor for metal.

an Indus script and animal device on a Persian Gulf–style seal; and (d) the Indus elephant seal from Gonur Depe (compiled from images supplied by Maurizio Tosi, Gregory L. Possehl, and Viktor Sarianidi).
Sites across Middle Asia have revealed BMAC, or BMAC-like, artifacts (adapted from figure 10.8 in Fredrik T. Hiebert. Origins of the Bronze Age Oasis Civilization in Central Asia. Cambridge, MA: Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, 1994). The word Meluhha used in cuneiform texts is called mleccha in Ancient Indian texts. The region of Meluhha speakers may include regions of Ancient India and also Straits of Malaka (Malacca) in the Indian Ocean. More than 2000 words of Meluhha speakers explain the readings of over 8000 Indus Script inscriptions. These inscriptions are in Meluhha hypertexts read rebus; for e.g. karibha, ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'. Such an elephant is shown on an Indus Script seal from Gonur Tepe. It is for linguists to figure out how Meluhha word for elephant travelled in Eurasia and got used in Gonur Tepe (spelled as Gonur Depe on the map) of Bactria-Mariana Cultural Complex. With the comments of Angela Marcangonio presented in the following excerpts, it is suggested that the linguists shold re-visit their theories about the roots of IndoEuropean language family.Let me cite a reference in Mahābhārata which refers to mleccha (cognate Meluhha, as a language used by Vidura and Yudhishthira): "Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words, the illustrious Kunti was deeply grieved, and with her children, O bull of Bharata's race, stepped into the boat and went over the Ganges. Then leaving the boat according to the advice of Vidura, the Pandavas took with them the wealth that had been given to them (while at Varanavata) by their enemies and safely entered the deep woods. In the house of lac, however, that had been prepared for the destruction of the Pandavas, an innocent Nishada woman who had come there for some purpose, was, with her children burnt to death. And that



78
worst of Mlechchhas, the wretched Purochana (who was the architect employed in building the house of lac) was also burnt in the conflagration. And thus were the sons of Dhirtarashtra with their counsellors deceived in their expectations. And thus also were the illustrious Pandavas, by the advice of Vidura, saved with their mother. But the people (of Varanavata) knew not of their safety. And the citizens of Varanavata, seeing the house of lac consumed (and believing the Pandavas to have been burnt to death) became exceedingly sorry. And they sent messengers unto king Dhritarashtra to represent everything that had happened. And they said to the monarch, 'Thy great end hath been achieved! Thou hast at last burnt the Pandavas to death! Thy desire fulfilled, enjoy with thy children. O king of the Kurus, the kingdom.' Hearing this, Dhritarashtra with his children, made a show of grief, and along with his relatives, including [paragraph continues] Kshattri (Vidura) and Bhishma the foremost of the Kurus, performed the last honours of the Pandavas.' (Mahābhārata, Section CXLIII,, Jatugriha Parva, pp. 302-303). The Great Epic is replete with hundreds of references to Mlecchas and mleccha speakers.

I suggest that the settlement of Gonur Tepe was by people from Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization. Parallels between Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization settlements and Gonur settlements are vivid and emphatic, apart from the commonly shared writing system of Indus Script cipher.

The fortified settlements of Gonur Tepe with citadel compare with the layout of Dholavira fortified settlement and citadel with gateway suggesting that the Dholavira artisans migrated to Gonur in search of minerals and settled there for metalwork. The evidence for metalwork of Gonur Tepe is provided by a seal with Indus Script inscription including pictorial motif of an elephant and text message of 8 hieroglyphs/hypertexts deciphered in this monograph.

scholars working on the contemporary but very different Andronovo and Bactrian Margiana archaeological complexes of the 2d millennium BCE have identified both as Indo-Iranian, and particular sites so identified are being used for nationalist purposes. There is, however, no compelling archaeological evidence that they had a common ancestor or that either is IndoIranian. Ethnicity and language are not easily linked with an archaeological signature, and the identity of the Indo-Iranians remains elusive." (C. C.

Bronze Age Indo-Iranian Archaeological Complexes, west of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization

Afghanistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan, were the remains of a connected Bronze Age civilization centered on the upper Amu Darya (Oxus). He named the complex
the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) and the inhabitants of that period and region, the Oxus civilization. The name Andronovo complex comes from the village of Andronovo in Siberia where in 1914, several graves were discovered, with skeletons in crouched positions, buried with richly decorated pottery. The name has been used to refer to a set of contemporaneous Bronze Age cultures that flourished c. 2300–1000 BCE in western Siberia and the west Asiatic steppes of Kazakhstan. This culture is thought to have been a pastoral people who reared horses, cattle, sheep and goats."

Distribution of archaeological sites (in red) in the Murgab Delta. "The northern delta settlements include those now known as the ruins at Kelleli, Adji Kui, Taip, Gonur, and Togolok (Togoluk)...It is presumed that as the northern delta area became more dry, large metropolises like Gonur were abandoned. Further to the south, the ancient city of Mervbecame an Achaemenid era (519-331 BCE) administrative centre and perhaps even the capital of the satrapy that included Mouru. Mouru was then known to the Achaemenians as Margu(sh) and to the Greeks as Μαργιανή. Margiana is the derived EnglishLatin name of Margu. The Sassanian name for the region was Marv. "
Photo credit: University of BolognaSource: http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/merv/gonur.htm "The environs of Mouru, the third nation listed in the Zoroastrian scriptures, the Avesta's book of Vendidad, are generally thought to have included the Murgab river delta, that is, the region around Merv which today is a city in southern Turkmenistan. Ruins of over 150 ancient settlements dating back to the early Bronze Age (2500-1700 BCE) have been found in the Murgab delta region which covers an area of more than 3000 sq. km. and contains about 78 oases."

Another reconstruction of the Gonur north complex. "A large necropolis lies to the west of the site. In the centre of the northern complex is a fortified citadel-like structure. Both complexes have fortification walls. The fortification walls of the southern complex are wide, 8 to 10 metres tall and interspaced with round towers along its sides and corners. There are residential quarters walls within the fortifications." Reference: Excavations at Southern Gonur, by V.

"Griffin-like Simurgh (Persian: سیمرغ ), also spelled simorgh, simurg, simoorg or simourv, also known as Angha (Persian: عنقا ), is the modern Persian name for a fabulous, benevolent, mythical flying creature. The figure can be found in all periods of Greater Iranian art and literature, and is evident also in the iconography of medieval Armenia, the Byzantine empire , and other regions that were within the sphere of Persian cultural influence. Through cultural assimilation the Simurgh was introduced to the Arabic-speaking world, where the concept was conflated with other Arabic mythical birds such as the Ghoghnus, a bird having some mythical relation with the date palm, and further developed as the Rukh (the origin of the English word "Roc")." http://www.flickr.com/photos/27305838@N04/4830444236
"During the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, a civilization was established in the ancient delta of the Murghab River, on the southeastern edge of a territory famous than as Turkestan. This Bronze Age site is recognized as Gonur Tepe. A civilization that flourished before being buried by time and discovered later on in present-day Turkmenistan. In the seventh millennium BC, Murgab River became the place where first agricultural settlements started to appear. The site was called “Margush” in Old Iranian texts and “Margiana” in Greek. The Margiana region has an area of 3000 square kilometers, housing 70 oasis, and 150 settlements.Gonur Tepe (or Gonur Depe) became the capital, serving as the administrative and religious center, and also a trade hub of the Margiana region.Nothing much was recognized about the complex of Gonur Tepe until 1972. When the Margiana Archaeological Expedition directed by the Greek-Russian archaeologist Victor Sarianidi discovered the fortress town. In this expedition, it was revealed that Gonur Tepe was a rectangular fortress with defensive walls, semicircular bastions, and adobe buildings. A palace and temples with fire altars dedicated to the Zoroastrian religion were also discovered. Archeologist Sarianidi explained that Gonur Tepe is the 5th oldest civilization on Earth. And it was the birthplace of Zoroastrianism. Other discoveries included extensive irrigation systems. That was similar to the ones found in Egypt, models of two-wheeled carts,



92
and silver and gold artifacts. The artifacts discovered on-site suggest that the town of Gonur Tepe had craftsmen who could mold metal and create materials for cult worship. Besides metal, the craftsmen also did bone and stone carvings. Sarianidi also found out what appears to be the boiler for the soma. A ritual drink is known to give immortality mentioned in the Rigveda and also known as haoma in the Avesta. Dishes with traces of cannabis, poppy, and ephedrine were also found. Which led to the theory that these were the ingredients of the immortality drink soma. Therefore; in 2009, a royal tomb was excavated in which remains of dogs, a cart with bronze-rimmed wheels, and a large bronze cauldron were discovered."
