Al-Lat (Arabic: اللات , romanized: Al-Lāt, pronounced [al(i)ˈlaːt(u)]), also spelled Allat,
Allatu and Alilat, is a pre-Islamic Arabian goddess worshipped under various
associations throughout the entire peninsula, including Mecca where she was
worshipped alongside Manat and al-'Uzza. The word Allat or Elat has been used to
refer to various goddesses in the ancient Near East, including the goddess Asherah
Athirat.
Al-Lat was attested in south Arabian
inscriptions as Lat and Latan, but
she had more prominence in north
Arabia and the Hejaz, and her cult
reached as far as Syria.
[7]
The
writers of the Safaitic script
frequently invoked al-Lat in their
inscriptions. She was also
worshipped by the Nabataeans and
she was associated with al-'Uzza.
The presence of her cult was
attested in both Palmyra and Hatra.
Under Greco-Roman influence, her
iconography began to show the
attributes of Athena, the Greek
goddess of war, as well as her
Roman equivalent Minerva.
According to Islamic sources, the
tribe of Banu Thaqif in Ta'if
especially holds reverence to her. In
Islamic tradition, her worship ended
when her temple in Ta'if was
demolished on the orders of
Muhammad.

Etymology and name



There are two possible etymologies
of the name al-Lat.[8] Medieval Arab
lexicographers derived the name
from the verb latta (to mix or knead
barley-meal). It has also been
associated with the "idol of
jealousy" erected in the temple of
Jerusalem according to the Book of
Ezekiel, which was offered an
oblation of barley-meal by the
husband who suspected his wife of
infidelity. It can be inferred from al
Kalbi's Book of Idols that a similar
ritual was practiced in the vicinity of
the idol of al-Lat.[8] Another
etymology takes al-Lat to be the
feminine form of Allah.[8] She may
have been known originally as ʿal
ʿilat, based on Herodotus'
attestation of the goddess as Alilat.[9]
Al-Lat was used as a title for the goddess Asherah or Athirat.[10] The word is akin to
Elat, which was the name of the wife of the Semitic deity El.[11] A western Semitic
goddess modeled on the Mesopotamian goddess Ereshkigal was known as Allatum,
and she was recognized in Carthage as Allatu.[12]
Pre-Islamic era
Al-Lat was mentioned as Alilat by the Greek historian Herodotus in his 5th-century BC
work Histories, and she was considered the equivalent of Aphrodite (Aphrodite
Urania):[13]

tradition)[2]

Attestations



According to Herodotus, the ancient Arabians believed in only two gods:
Al-Lat was widely worshipped in north Arabia, but in south Arabia she was not
popular and was not the object of an organized cult, with two amulets (inscribed "Lat"
on one, "Latan" on the other) being the only indication that this goddess received
worship in the area.[16] However, she seems to have been popular among the Arab
tribes bordering Yemen.[16] She was also attested in eastern Arabia; the name
Taymallat (a theophoric name invoking the goddess)[17] was attested as the name of a
man from Gerrha, a city located in the region.[18]
From Safaitic and Hismaic inscriptions, it is probable that she was worshipped as Lat
(lt).[7] In Safaitic inscriptions, al-Lat was invoked for solitude and mercy, as well to
provide well-being, ease and prosperity.[19] Travelers would invoke her for good
weather and protection.[19] She was also invoked for vengeance, booty from raids,
and infliction of blindness and lameness to anyone who defaces their inscriptions.[19]
The Qedarites, a northern Arabian tribal confederation, seemed to have also
worshipped al-Lat, as evidenced by a silver bowl dedicated by a Qedarite king, with
the goddess' name inscribed on it.[20]
The Assyrians call Aphrodite Mylitta, the Arabians Alilat [Greek
spelling: Ἀλιλάτ], and the Persians Mithra.[14]
They believe in no other gods except Dionysus and the Heavenly
Aphrodite; and they say that they wear their hair as Dionysus does
his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples. They call
Dionysus, Orotalt; and Aphrodite, Alilat.[15]

The Nabataeans and the people of Hatra also worshipped al-Lat, equating her with
the Greek goddesses Athena and Tyche and the Roman goddess Minerva.[21] She is
frequently called "the Great Goddess" in Greek in multilingual inscriptions.[21] The
Nabataeans regarded al-Lat as the mother of the deities, and her family relations
vary; sometimes she is regarded as the consort of Dushara and at other times as the
mother of Dushara.[7] Nabataean inscriptions call her and al-'Uzza the "brides of
Dushara".[22]
Remains of the temple of al-Lat, Palmyra, Syria
She had a temple in Iram, and al-Lat was referred as "the goddess who is in Iram" in a
Nabataean inscription.[1] She was also referred to as "the goddess who is in Bosra".[1]
Perhaps a local Hijazi form of her attested in Hegra alongside Dushara and Manat was
"Allat of 'Amnad".[1]



Al-Lat was closely related with al-'Uzza, and in some regions of the Nabataean
kingdom, both al-Lat and al-'Uzza were said to be the same goddess.[7] John F.
Healey believes that al-Lat and al-'Uzza originated as a single goddess, which parted
ways in the pre-Islamic Meccan tradition.[7] Susan Krone suggests that both al-Lat
and al-'Uzza were uniquely fused in central Arabia.[23]
Al-Lat was also venerated in Palmyra, where she was known as the "Lady of the
temple".[24] According to an inscription, she was brought into the Arab quarter of the
city by a member of the Bene Ma'zin tribe,[25] who were probably an Arab tribe.[26][a]
She had a temple in the city, which Teixidor believed to be the cultic center of
Palmyrene Arab tribes.[24] The practice of casting divination arrows, a common
divination method in Arabia, was attested in her temple; an honorific inscription
mentioning "a basin of silver for [casting] lots (lḥlq)".[28]
By the second-century AD, al-Lat in Palmyra began to be portrayed in the style of
Athena, and was referred to as "Athena-Allāt", but this assimilation does not extend
beyond her iconography.[29] The Palmyrene emperor Vaballathus, whose name is the
Latinized form of the theophoric name Wahballāt ("Gift of al-Lat"), began to use
Athenodorus as the Greek form of his name.[30]
Islamic era
In Islamic sources discussing pre-Islamic Arabia, al-Lat is attested as the chief
goddess of the Banu Thaqif tribe.[31] She was said to be venerated in Ta'if, where she
was called ar-Rabba ("The Lady"),[32][33] and she reportedly had a shrine there which
was decorated with ornaments and treasure of gold and onyx.[34] There, the goddess
was venerated in the form of a cubic granite rock.[31][12] The area around the shrine
was considered sacred; no trees could be felled, no animal could be hunted and no
human blood could be shed.[35]
According to al-Kalbi's Book of Idols, her shrine was under the guardianship of the
Banū Attāb ibn Mālik of the Banu Thaqif.[17] She was also venerated by other Arab
tribes, including the Quraysh, and their children would be named after the goddess,
such as Zayd al-Lat and Taym al-Lat.[17]
Al-Lat is also mentioned in pre-Islamic Arab poetry, such as in al-Mutalammis' satire



of Amr ibn-Hind:[36]
Al-Lat on a lion, flanked by two female figures, possibly al-'Uzza and Manat. 2nd-century AD relief from Hatra
A poem by the pre-Islamic monotheist Zayd ibn Amr mentions al-Lat, along with al
'Uzza and Hubal:[37]
Thou hast banished me for fear of lampoon and satire.
No! By Allat and all the sacred baetyls (ansab)
thou shalt not escape.
Am I to worship one lord or a thousand?
If there are as many as you claim,
I renounce al-Lat and al-Uzza, both of them,
as any strong-minded person would.
I will not worship al-Uzza and her two daughters...
I will not worship Hubal, though he was our lord
in the days when I had little sense.



Al-Lat was also called as a daughter of Allah along with the other two chief
goddesses al-'Uzza and Manat.[3][4][5][6] According to the Book of Idols, the Quraysh
were to chant the following verses as they circumambulate the Kaaba:[38]
The word gharaniq was translated as "most exalted females" by Faris in his English
translation of the Book of Idols, but he annotates this term in a footnote as "lit.
Numidean cranes".[38]
According to Islamic tradition, the shrine dedicated to al-Lat in Ta'if was demolished
on the orders of Muhammad, during the Expedition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, in the
same year as the Battle of Tabuk[34] (which occurred in October 630 AD).[39] The
destruction of the idol was a demand by Muhammad before he would allow any
reconciliation to take place with the tribes of Ta'if, who were under his siege.[40]
According to the Book of Idols, this occurred after the Banu Thaqif converted to
Islam, and that her temple was "burnt to the ground".[36]
Quran and Satanic Verses incident
Main article: Satanic Verses
In the Quran, she is mentioned along with al-‘Uzza and Manat in Sura 53:19–22,[41]
which became the subject of the alleged Satanic Verses incident,[42] an occasion on
which the Islamic prophet Muhammad had mistaken the words of "satanic
suggestion" for divine revelation.[43] Many different versions of the story existed (all
traceable to one single narrator Muhammad ibn Ka'b, who was two generations
removed from biographer Ibn Ishaq).[42] In its essential form, the story reports that
during Muhammad's recitation of Surat An-Najm, when he reached the following
verses:
By al-Lat and al-'Uzza,
And Manat, the third idol besides.
Verily they are the gharaniq
Whose intercession is to be sought.
Have you thought of al-Lāt and al-‘Uzzá



Satan tempted him to utter the following line:
[42]
Following this, the angel Gabriel chastised Muhammad for uttering said line, and the
verses were abrogated with a new revelation:
[44]
The majority of Muslim scholars have rejected the historicity of the incident on the
basis of the theological doctrine of 'isma (prophetic infallibility i.e., divine protection
of Muhammad from mistakes) and their weak isnads (chains of transmission).
[43]
Due
to its defective chain of narration, the tradition of the Satanic Verses never made it
into any of the canonical hadith compilations,
[45]
though reference and exegesis
about the Verses appear in early histories, such as al-Tabari's Tārīkh ar-Rusul wal
Mulūk and Ibn Ishaq's Sīrat Rasūl Allāh (as reconstructed by Alfred Guillaume).
[42]
The "Grinder" legend
Various legends about her origins were known in medieval Islamic tradition, including
one which linked al-Lat's stone with a man who grinds cereal (al-latt, "the
grinder").
[46]
The stone was used as a base for the man (a Jew) to grind cereal for the
pilgrims of Mecca.
[47]
While most versions of this legend place the man at Ta'if, other
versions place him at either Mecca or 'Ukaz.
[46]
After the man's death, the stone, or
the man in the form of a stone, was deified,
[47]
according to some legends after the
Khuza'a drove the Jurhum out of Mecca, while other legends report it was Amr ibn
Luhayy who deified the grinder.
[46]
and Manāt, the third, the other?
— Sura 53, 19–20
These are the exalted gharāniq, whose intercession is hoped for.
).تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى In Arabic (
Are yours the males and His the females? That were indeed an
unfair division!
— Sura 53, 21–22



Michael Cook noticed the oddity of this story, as it would make al-Lat masculine.[48]
Gerald Hawting believes the various legends that link al-Lat with that of al-latt, "the
grinder", was an attempt to relate al-Lat with Mecca.[46] He also compared the
legends to Isaf and Na'ila, who according to legend were a man and a woman who
fornicated inside the Kaaba and were petrified.[47]
F. V. Winnet saw al-Lat as a lunar deity due to association of a crescent with her in
'Ayn esh-Shallāleh and a Lihyanite inscription mentioning the name of Wadd over the
title of 'fkl lt.[7] René Dussaud and Gonzague Ryckmans linked her with Venus while
others have thought her to be a solar deity.[7] John F. Healey considers al-Uzza
actually might have been an epithet of al-Lat before becoming a separate deity in the
Meccan pantheon.[7] Redefining Dionysos considers she might have been a god of
vegetation or a celestial deity of atmospheric phenomena and a sky deity.[13]
According to Wellhausen, the Nabataeans believed al-Lat was the mother of Hubal
(and hence the mother-in-law of Manāt).[49]
It has been hypothesized that al-Lat is the consort of Allah based on the fact that it is
typical of deities in that area of the world to have consorts.[50]
In Ta'if, al-Lat's primary idol was a cubic stone,[31] sometimes described as white in
color.[51] Waqidi's mention of the 'head' (ra's) of ar-Rabba may imply that the idol was
perceived in human or animal form, although Julius Wellhausen resisted this
implication.[51]
Mythological role
Iconography



The Lion of Al-Lat, representing the goddess and her consort.
Early Palmyrene depictions of al-Lat share iconographical traits with Atargatis (when
seated) and Astarte (when standing).[52] The Lion of Al-Lat that once adorned her
temple depicts a lion and a gazelle, the lion representing her consort,[2] and the
gazelle representing al-Lat's tender and loving traits, as bloodshed was not permitted
under al-Lat's retaliation.[53]
Al-Lat was associated with the Greek goddess Athena (and by extension, the Roman
Minerva) in Nabataea, Hatra and Palmyra.[29][21] It seems that her identification with
Athena was only a mere change in iconography,[29] and al-Lat's character noticeably
softened the warlike Athena in places where she was equated with.[54] One
Nabataean relief of Athena-al-Lat depicts the goddess bearing both Athena and al
Lat's attributes.[54] The relief depicts the goddess in the style of Athena, but having a
stylized square face (resembling Nabataean eye-idols) in place of the Gorgoneion.[54]
The Lion of Al-Lat statue that adorned her temple in Palmyra was damaged by the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in 2015 but has been since restored.[55] It
now stands in the National Museum of Damascus, but it may be returned to Palmyra
in the future.[55]

Notes



a. Ma'zin is an Arabic word meaning "goat herders".[27] While Teixidor described
the tribe as Arab,[26] Michał Gawlikowski, head of the Polish archaeological
expedition in Palmyra between 1980 and 2011, stated that the tribe is best
understood as an alliance of pastoralists from different origins who settled in the
city.[27]
