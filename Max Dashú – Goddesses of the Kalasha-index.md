Goddesses of the Kalasha
July 9, 2013Uncategorized
One of the last peoples of western Asia to retain their aboriginal
culture are the Kalasha of upper Pakistan. They speak an ancient
Indo-Iranian language, Dardic, which conserves very ancient
features. They took refuge in the mountains of Chitral a long time
ago, surviving many waves of invaders. One of the last of these
named them Kafir Kalash, “Black Pagans,” after the black robes of
the women, and their refusal to convert to Islam. The individual tribes
call themselves by older names: Kati, Kom, Vasi, Presun.
A neighboring group of Kalash
people speak a different Indo
Iranian language but shared
many cultural ideas and deities.
[Witzel, 2] They live in the
northwestern region of
Afghanistan, which Muslims
dubbed Kafiristan, Land of
Pagans. In 1895-96, the Afghan
emir Abdur Rahman Khan led an
attack on the country, declaring “that either the Kafirs would be
converted to Islam or be wiped off the face of the earth... Even the
names of their villages were Islamised.” [Zaidi, online]
The emirʼs armies forcibly converted the Kalasha, and destroyed
their temples and icons. “Altars were burned, priests murdered, boys
kidnapped and conscripted to military school in Kabul. Only several
hundred Kati Kafirs (the Red Kafirs of the Bashgal Valley) managed
to flee across the border.” [Witek, online] The conqueror renamed
the region Nuristan, “Land of Light,” symbolizing what he saw as

their rescue from pagan darkness.
On the Pakistani side, the Chitrali Kalash have lived under steady
pressure to convert to Islam, and about half the remaining
populations have done so, to date. Three valleys, with about 3500
inhabitants, hold on to their ancient culture. [Mohammed Bugi,
personal communication, June 5, 2013] They are like a besieged
island, trying to survive surrounded by the dominant, highly
conservative Pakistani society, with the added pressures of poverty
and tourist bombardments.
By their own telling, the cultural distinctness
of the Kalash goes beyond their pagan
beliefs. They have a saying, “Our women are
free” (homa istrizia azat asan), and they
assert that Kalasha women have “choice”
(chit). Wynne Maggiʼs fine book, Our
Women Are Free: Gender and Ethnicity in
the Hindukush, gives a detailed portrait of
the culture. She explores the contradictions
between that affirmation and the patriarchal
aspects of the culture, which are
considerable. (For example, Maggi says that
“The concept of womenʼs freedom is
entirely without connotations of womenʼs solidarity.” [38] I wonʼt
attempt to summarize her contributions, which would be a much
longer article. Instead, this article concentrates on the Kalasha
goddesses.
A key source on Kalash religion is The Kafirs of the Hindu-Kush
(1896) by George Scott Robertson, who traveled in Kafiristan five
years before the forced conversions began. He listed 16 principal
deities, writing “The gods are worshipped by sacrifices, by dances,



Sacred image of a
goddess or ancestor
by singing hymns (Lálu Kunda) and by uttering invocations (Namach
Kunda)...” [381] (Iʼll be quoting extensively from this source.)
Richard Strand recorded testimony from a Vasi man
named Zaman Xan: “In pre-Islamic times they had
this quality, right? They were the god-callers; they
would call the gods. They recited history... History
like, ‘We came from such-and-such a place. Imroʼs
praise is this. Moneʼs praise should be this.ʼ A
personʼs — uh, what was her name? – ‘Disañiʼs praise
is this type.ʼ They would shout it out. Yes.”
[http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Vasi/VasiCulture/Zaman16.html
Gullam Ullah told Strand, “There was Křumâi – they used to call it
Mercy-Pleading Křumâiʼs [place], right? That womanʼs — she was a
holy woman. Křumâi, a woman, Křumâi. Another — she [Křumâi] was
lower, right? — like, higher, divine, important woman, a holy woman,
was Disaňi. One of our peoplesʼ gods was Disaňi; she was a woman.
The rest were males, for instance, Gish and Mone, and whoever else.
You know them all; youʼve written them down, right?” [History of the
Kom,”
http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Kamkata/Kom/KomTexts/KomHist.html
The Kalasha spoke of a male creator, Imrá, who had numerous
shrines. He endowed other gods such as Moni, Gish, Satarám with
life from his breath; “but Dizane sprang into existence from his right
breast. Placing her in the palm of his hand, Imrá threw her violently
upwards. She alighted in a lake, and was there concealed and



Shrine of Disane, northeast
Afghanistan
released...” [Robertson, 381] The goddess is conceived of as an
emanation from a male creator, but also as coming into being
independently. By other accounts, she is his sister.
Dizane
Dizane is the great Mother Goddess of the
Kalasha. Variants on her name are Disani,
Disni, and she is also called Dezalik (“sister
of Dezau,” another name for the creator
god). This sister-brother pairing is a deep
matriarchal pattern in many cultures around
the world. Disani “is important; she is the
goddess of the hearth and of life force; she
protects children and birth giving women...”
[Witzel, 5; he derives her name from the
same root as the goddess Jeshtak (or in
her Hindu form, Jyeshtaa.]
Robertson noted, “Dizane is a popular
goddess, and is worshipped wherever I have been in Kafiristan. The
Giché, or new year festival, is entirely in her honor, and she also has
special observances during the Dizanedu holiday.” That the goddess
presides over the new year—as Auset/Isis did in Egypt—is testimony
to her great importance. Hers was the greatest festival of the
Kalasha, which Muslims described as “the Kafir Eid.”
“In the evening and throughout the night there were feasting and
rejoicings in most houses at
Kámdesh. At the first glimpse of dawn on the morning of the 17th, in
spite of a heavy snowstorm, men and women issued from every
house carrying torches of pine-wood, and marched up the hill crying,
‘Súch, súch,ʼ and deposited their brands in a heap in front of



Bringing torches to Disane at dawn

Afghanistan
Dizaneʼs shrine. The blaze was increased by
ghee being thrown on the fire. The Debilála
chanted the praises of the goddess, the
people joining in the refrain at regular
intervals.” [Robertson, 583]
“Dizane takes care of the wheat crop, and
to propitiate her, or to increase the produce
of wheat-fields, simple offerings are made
unaccompanied by the slaughter of an
animal.” More patriarchally, the men of
Giché offer a goat to Dizane every time a
son is born (although she presides over all
births). [Robertson, 410]
Several hymns to Disni recorded in Shtiwe, Nuristan, celebrate her as
a giver of life-force. This one, sung in early spring when the flocks
are taken up to the mountain pastures, calls to mind Avestan paeans
to the milk-giving Iranian goddess Anahita:
O Disni, you are the protector of the gates of God
and moreover you have eighteen grades:
Keeper of the temple
Giver of milk to human beings,
Protector of infants,
Well-wisher of man-kind [sic],
Bearer of welfare from God,
You keep the door of milk flowing,
You bring sensuality to mankind,
You increase what is created,
You are the one who receives permits from God,
And you are the keeper of the nine gates of mercy.
[Edelberg, 10]



One important tradition shows Dizane as the Sacred Tree. Robertson
had collected a “good story” about this tree, “but the record of this
story was lost in a mountain torrent.” [385] He remembered bits of it:
“Dizane the trunk of the fabulous tree whose roots were the goddess
Nirmali, while the branches were seven families of brothers, each
seven in number. Some Kafirs affirmed that Dizane was the daughter
of Satarám. She may have been originally the goddess of
fruitfulness. She usually shares a shrine with other deities, but at
Kámdesh she has the pretty little temple... all to herself. There, at the
Munzilo festival, those Kanesh who live in the upper village have to
sleep in the open.” [Robertson, 411] The emphasis on outdoor
shrines in Nature is pervasive in Kalasha culture.
Another story told by a Kám priest reveals more about what became
of Dizane after Imrá threw her up in the air and she alighted in the
waters: “In a distant land, unknown to living men, a large tree grew in
the middle of a lake. The tree was so big, that if any one had
attempted to climb it, he would have taken nine years to accomplish
the feat; while the spread of the branches was so great that it would
occupy eighteen years to travel from one side of it to other.
Satarám became enamoured of the tree, and journeyed toward it. On
his near approach he was suddenly seized with a mighty trembling,
and the huge tree burst asunder, disclosing the goddess Disane in
the center of its trunk. Satarám had, however, seen enough; he
turned round and fled in consternation.” [Robertson, 382-83]
“Dizane began to milk goats.... While she was engaged in this
occupation, a devil observed her. He had four eyes, two in front and
two behind. Rushing forward, he seized Dizane, while she bent her
head to her knees, quaking with terror. The fiend tried to reassure
her, saying, ‘It is for you I have come.ʼ She afterwards wandered into
the Presungul, and stepping into the swift-flowing river, gave birth to

brow, and traces of
blood offerings
an infant, who at once, unaided, stepped ashore, the turbulent
waters becoming quiet, and piling themselves upon either hand, to
allow the child to do so.” The people were amazed at this, and at his
starting down the river by himself. He took the name Baghisht, given
him by a man who asked for his name. This son of Dizane was one of
the Kalash gods. [383]
In Chitral, Kalasha women invoke Dezalik in the
bashali, the womenʼs house where they go to
menstruate and give birth. If a birth is difficult, they
offering walnuts to her, praying, “Oh, my Dezalik of
the bashali, make her deliver quickly, bring the new
flower into her arms, donʼt make things difficult;
your eating and drinking.” And again: “Oh, my
Dezalik of the bashali, one has come under your
care. Bring health, set the flower in her arms, your
eating and drinking,” as the women throw more
walnuts to the goddess. [Maggi, 145]
The goddess Disni plays a key role in another story.
The gods wanted to get control of the House of the
Sun, inhabited by a wealthy demon. His death will
mean the healing of the world. The god Mandi
gathers a company of the gods, including the goddess Disni, and
leads them up the hill. They find the house, and an old woman is
there. Mandi goes to ask her about it. “It is a house between up and
down; inside there are seven brothers (called Dizano, cf. Dezâlik of
the Kalash) who have many things: the sun and moon, gold, silver,
water, fields where they sow.”
The Old Woman instructs Mandi on how to make visible the rope that
suspends the house between heaven and earth. But when he goes
back to relate this to the gods, he forgets what she told him. This



happens three times. Another god has to follow him and report back
her instructions. The godsʼ first attempt, by shooting arrows, fails
because the house is made of iron and the cords holding it up are
invisible.
“They ask Disni to sow seeds, which ripen quickly, and are threshed.
The chaff attaches itself to the thread and it is visible in white.” Then
Mara is able to shoots arrow through the cords, bringing down the
house. But its door will not open. Disni tells Mandi to look at her
white, full thighs. He becomes excited and is able to jump against
the door with enough force to break it. He kills the seven demons.
[Witzel, 5. The seven brothers are called Dizano, which seems to
relate them to Disane and the seven branches of her tree in the
earlier story; though here they are demonized, and Disni works
against her sons.]
Dizane is also remembered as a builder. In Presungul is “a great
irrigation channel” “which it is affirmed that Dizane herself
constructed. There is also a good bridge in the same district called
by her name.” [Robertson, 410] This recalls European faery stories of
Melusine as a builder of bridges or castles, or the Basque lamiñaku,
as well as Indigenous traditions of ancestral female shamans in
Yunnan. But a much closer parallel exists among the Dards of
Ladakh, where the goddess Gan-si Lha-mo “is especially associated
with irrigation and the building of water canals.” The Darnishi (fairies)
also aid people in these tasks. [“Religion of the Dards in Ladakh,”
http://texts.00.gs/Religion_of_the_Dards_in_Ladakh.htm, with a
truncated cite of fn. 202: “Snoy 1975y51 & 175]
“When the men of a tribe are away raiding, and the women collect in
the villages to dance day and night to propitiate the gods and sing
their praises, Dizane is one of the chief deities they supplicate for
help. Her hymn goes something like this: ‘Send my man home safe



Horned headdress of Kati women
and unwoundedʼ...” But they call on the
god Gish to bring plunder. [Robertson,
410] These womenʼs dances must have
been something to see.
Kati women wore horned headdresses,
with four horns made of human hair. (The
birth of a four-horned goat was
considered a very auspicious omen of
divine favor.) Robertson witnessed one of
these womenʼs dances at Lutdeh in
Kafiristan. He wrote that while the men
were away on a raid, the women leave off
their field work and gather in the village. For most of the day and all
night long they do nothing but dance and feast. [621]
“They have elected three Mírs, the chief of whom is Kan Jannahʼs
wife. These three persons direct the revels, and contribute greatly to
the feasting. Kan Jannahʼs wife is carried from one place to another
as a ‘flying angelʼ on the shoulders of a stalwart young woman, each
of the other Mirs holding one of her hands. The little party staggers
over the narrow shaking bridge, and then starts off at a run, to the
outspoken delight of the onlookers. Occasionally the women dance
on some convenient house-top. In the afternoon they invariably feast
and dance under the big mulberry tree in the east village, and use
the east or west vllage dancing-place according to the position of
the sun. During the night all congregate at the east village dancing
place. [622]
“Although they all seem abandnoed to feasting and holiday-making,
they are nevertheless engaged in strictly religious ceremonies. To
watch them at night, when the majority are obviously tired, leaves no
double in the mind on this point. I have... observed by the fitful light



“Womenʼs Dance to the Gods,” from Kafirs
of the Hindu-Kush
of the wood fire how exhausted and
earnest the women looked. One young
woman, shrugging her shoulders in time
to the music, had streams of
perspiration rolling down her face,
although she was all muscle apparently.
The exertions these women undergo
are astonishing to see. Many of the very
old women have to give up from sheer
exhaustion, but the midde-aged and
the young work away singing and
dancing 622 hour after hour and night
after night.” [625]
“The aged are very earnest and solemn; the young girls, on the other
hand, are ready to seize every opportunity to make improper
remarks to any male spectator of whom they do not stand in awe.
Stlll the great majority of the dancers at all times attend strictly to
the dancing... They evidently believed themselves to be engaged in
an occupation which did them infinite credit in every way. I could
read as much in their faces and in their gestures.
“All wore horned caps except the little girls...” The women were
dressed in their finery, wearing the national budzun [a dark woolen
cloak]. A large number carried dancing axes, and not a few had
daggers.” One old woman flourished her dagger before Robertsonʼs
eyes for a few minutes, to the delight of the other dancers. [625-26]
The women of Lutdeh danced to Imra, Gish, Dizane, and the other
deities in their turn. “After each dance there was a short rest, after
which the women collected again in the centre of the platform.” They
did a call-and-response anthem, and began dancing again. [626]



Goddess riding on a
goat
Krumai
She lives on her sacred mountain Tirich Mir, home of the fairies.
[Maggi, 12] She had a shrine at Badáwan, where the Afghan Kalasha
used to sacrifice goats to the deities and mountain fairies.
[Robertson, 384, footnote 1] Robertson first thought Krumai was a
male god, “but after seeing her effigy in one of the dancing-houses
in Presungul, no doubt could remain concerning her sex. She is
worshipped everywhere probably...” though he saw no sacrifices to
her. [411]
“The goddess Krumai, in the shape of a goat, came
over from Tirich Mir, and went among them [the other
deities], but none recognized her except Imrá, who
took an opportunity, when she was not looking, to
push her into the mountain-stream. Struggling out of
the water, Krumai ran diagonally up the steep rock,
leaving the marks still visible in a vein of mineral of a
color different from the rest of the rock. When she got
to the top she began kicking down showers of stones
on to the gods below, to their great annoyance. Imrá
told them that the goat was Krumai, and added that
he alone had been clever enough to discover that fact.
On hearing this they all adjured Krumai to behave
better. She thereupon assumed her proper shape, came down
amongst them, and subsequently entertained them all at a
sumptuous banquet which she brought from Tirich Mir and served
on silver dishes.” [Robertson, 383-4]
Some Krumai traditions resemble stories about Dizane. She flees
from a giant, hiding in a tree, but is impregnated when he urinates on
the tree. Krumai then gives birth to the god Mande. [Snoy: 160-161,
in http://texts.00.gs/Religion_of_the_Dards_in_Ladakh.htm This web



page elsewhere refers to a “C^omo Mandi [who] is said to be, along
with Le`i Nakr.n, the ruler over all the deities. The title C^omo stands
for queen ... and clearly shows the female aspect of the deity.”]
Ceremonies always ended with a dance to Krumai: “a comical dance
performed in her name... always winds up the performances at the
regular ceremonies, when each important deity is danced to in turn.”
[Robertson, 411] Her goat aspect is reflected in the horned
headdresses of Kati women.
Other goddesses
“Saranji is the tutelary deity of the village of
Pontzgrom. She has a little shrine on the top of the
village tower, and a second near the mouth of the
Pontzgul She is also worshipped in the Bashgul
Valley.” [Roberston, 411]
“Nirmali is the Kafir Lucina. She takes care of
women and children, and protects lying-in women.
The womenʼs retreats, the ‘pshars,ʼ are under her
special protection.” Recall that Nirmali is the roots
of the Sacred Tree, underlining the earthen nature
of these places, the female quality that the Kalash designate as
pragata.
“Besides creating the gods, Imrá also created seven daughters,
whose special province it is to watch over the work of agriculture
with a protecting hand. As the time for sowing approaches, goats are
sacrificed in their honor, in order that crops may be ample and the
earth beneficent.” [Robertson, 382]
The vetr (fairies)



The fairies are everywhere. “They have to be propitiated in order that
the millet crops may be good. A fire is lit in the center of the growing
crop, juniper-cedar, ghee, and bread are placed upon it, and a
certain ritual intoned. No animal is sacrificed. At the time that the
ceremony to the fairies is being prepared, certain thick bread cakes
have to be offered to Yush the devil. So also when Dizane is being
invoked to protect or improve the wheat, Yush has to be
simultaneously propitiated.” But no one dances for him. [Robertson,
412]
“There is a certain powerful fairy called the Charmo Vetr, who lives
high up the Kutaringul [stream]... This vetr (fairy) continually receives
offerings of goats and kids from the Kam tribe, and in return has
given that people great help against its enemies.” [Robertson, 412]
Another fairy lived in the branches of a magnificent cedar, in whose
branches was an Imrá stone. Cheese and other offerings were left
there unguarded, since no one would be foolish enough to steal from
this tree. The mischievous fairies like to carry off the basket of flour
from sacrifices, and torment the priest in other ways, tearing his
robes, or setting upon him. But they “are more benevolent than
malicious. On the night preceding the Dizanedu festival [for Dizane]
there is an annual dance in honor of the fairies.” [Ibid, 412-13]
Another story alludes to female ancestors as founders of nations.
Imrá sat on the rocks where the Kti and Presun rivers join, “making
butter in a golden goat-skin churn. From the skin three women
emerged, who went and populated different countries. Imra then
added water, and a fourth woman was created, who settled in
Presungul.” [Roberston, 385]
Kalasha Sanctuaries
Robertson notes limits on the importance of Imra, athough he has



temples in every village, with a wooden idol or block of stone. His
shrines “are small, and have no peculiarity to distinguish them from
those of the other gods.” Kalasha shrines are little towers with
masonry rubble bases, wooden frames with door or window through
which the idol looks, and often above are poles hung with iron
pieces. Imra virtually always has his own shrine, while three to five
other deities can share one shrine. [394]
“At many of the religious dances he is not more honored than many
of the other gods and goddesses. He receives three rounds, but
there is none of the enthusiasm which is infused into the dances for
Gish, or the light-heartedness which accompanies the comical steps
and posturings in honor of Krumai. Possibly in former times Imra the
Creator was chiefly worshipped, but at the present time Gish is
certainly the popular deity in the Bashgul valley...” [389]
At Bragamatál village was a hillside
shrine “hung with juniper-cedar all
along the front,” with four windows for
Dizane, Shumai or Krumai, Saranji, and
Satarám, with another empty window.
“Dizaneʼs idol has a round face with
white stones for eyes, and an irregular
white quartz for a mouth.” She looks
“cheerful,” while the others are
mouthless. [Robertons, 395] (This
distinction of having a mouth was also
observed of the Disni statue hidden in a cellar wall at Shtiwe,
Nuristan; see below.)
Many sacred stones stood out on the land, where sacrifices were
offered; some placed for deities, others “to the memory of
ancestors.” [399] “There are distinct traces of ancestor-worship in



Kafiristan, although it is strenuously denied by the people. The
effigies erected to the memory of the dead are sometimes sacrificed
to, and have their pedestals sprinkled over with blood by
descendants suffering from sickness. Long fragments of stone are
set on end in many places. These, no doubt, are partly intended as a
kind of cenotaph, but a goat is always killed when they are erected.
The Marnma festival is in honor of the illustrious dead.” [Roberston,
414]
Animal sacrifices were important in Kalasha religion. In fact, all
killings of animals for food were ceremonial. Men would pour water
on the sheep or goat, which could not be killed unless it then shook
its entire body vigorously. (Robertson notes parallels in Greek
custom—this was also a requirement, for example, in the ceremony
of the Delphic oracles—and among the Thugs of India, who were
devotees of Kali.) When the animal shook itself, everyone present
made a kissing sound, and the sacrifice proceeded. [423]
Islamicization
Islamic influences had already appeared among the Kalasha that
Robertson talked to, as in this origin story naming “father Adam.”
“After Imrá created the world, Baba Adam and his wife were in
Kashmir. They and their forty children were on one occasion sleeping
in pairs, and when they awoke no single pair understood the
language of another pair.” Imra sent them off in couples to populate
the world, but they were reluctant to leave Kashmir and protested.”
(This may reflect the paradisical reputation of Kashmir rather than a
historic memory of Kashmiri origins.) Another change was that the
male gods came to be referred to by the Persian word “prophets,”
apparently in a bid to downplay the old polytheism. [384-86]
The Kalasha have been subjected to violence and intimidation since



Wooden icon of a goddess mounted
on a mountain goat, probably Disane
or Krumai
the forced conversions at the end of the 19th century. They still tell
stories about people throwing themselves into the rivers rather than
convert. [Iara Lee, 2013] Muslims consider conversion to be
irreversible, the penalty for “apostasy” being death. Some people
could not bear to give up their deities, and hid them. One was found
hidden, face to the wall, in a cellar in the town of Shtiwe, some 80
years after the Emirʼs persecutions:
“People in Shtiwe said that the statue
represented the goddess Disni. It had been
hidden at the time when the people of
Shtiwe began to read the ‘kalimaʼ [i.e. when
they became Moslem]... It is an old legend
that the name of the statue was Disni. It is
shaped like a woman. Her vulva is hidden
behind the head of the horned goat. The
two horns are grasped by the hands of
Disni... When Islam came to Nuristan, the
grandfather of Abdullah Jan (Wäci) was
frightened and hid the statue in the wall... In
Kafir time the statue had its place in the
western part of the sitting room near the
wall with its face turned to the room.”
The old Wäci had hidden the goddess during the Emirʼs forced
conversions, placing her in the cellar wall where the ghee was
stored. “Disni is protector of the cattle and the milk products. She
might still have been able to execute some of her power from her
hiding-place.” She looked like she had been anointed with butter,
and was in good condition.
The old manʼs grandson, a hajji, had been out of town and was going
to burn the statue, but the government intervened and saved it. He



Kalasha woman in Chitral
swore if any others turned up, he would burn them. [L. Edelberg, 6
7] One man said, “You ask me when we danced in front of [the
goddess] Disni. We did it in winter, in zhibulu. But the songs used
have disappeared with the old men and women... Now only one Kafir
is alive and he does not remember the songs. He is stupid.”
[Edelberg, 7]
Another wave of attacks on Kalasha was launched in the 1970s, but a
cultural revival began around 1975. [Maggi, 106] Abbas Zaidi writes
that the Taliban seized large tracts of Kalasha land from 1981 to
1995, forced Kalasha women into marriage, and killed people. Their
poverty is exacerbated by government discrimination, which treats
them as ineligible for loans, while police and courts ignore the
appropriations of their lands. “Within the Chitral society they are
completely ostracized for being ‘Kafirsʼ...” and are, as Akbar S.
Ahmed wrote, subject to “formidable social, and psychological
pressures resulting from being viewed as ‘dirtyʼ non-believers by
aggressive and powerful neighbors.” [Zaidi] They are targets; some
Muslim children throw stones at them. [Maggi, 13]
But as Wasiara Aya said to Wynne Maggi,
“Why should we convert, ne baba (right,
sister)?... Kalasha is good, isnʼt that right,
sister?” [30]
A new film “The Kalasha and the Crescent”
deals with the ongoing pressures of
conversion and the tourist industry, with
footage of Muslim Pakistanis strenously
denying coercion and the Indigenous people
trying to cover their faces from intrusive
tourists snapping pictures. A Kalash woman
says: “We believe only in one god – we have



goddesses, yes – but only one god.” (Their multiple gods seem to
have collapsed into one in response to monotheist pressure—but
they arenʼt giving up their goddesses.) [Iara Lee, 2013] The
insistence that the Kalash only had one god is belied by the historical
record, though it is understandable that in a Muslim-dominated
society, they would want to escape the stigma attached to
polytheism as “ignorance.”
Powerful economic, political and social forces are brought to bear,
that intimidate people out of fear for their survival and that of their
children, to cede cultural traditions they would have otherwise kept.
Itʼs called religious supercession. Certain kinds of words are used to
degrade and crush Indigenous spiritual traditions: “folk stories,”
“superstition,” “magic,” “demonic,” “devil-worship,” “ignorance of the
true god.” The same pressures are at work eroding the aboriginal
culture of the Amazighen (Tuareg), and the Nuba of Sudan. Christian
missionaries are working to get aboriginal peoples in Southeast Asia
and South America to convert.
Now a movement has begun to support the rights of Kalasha, to
retain their cultural traditions and to determine their future. Please
