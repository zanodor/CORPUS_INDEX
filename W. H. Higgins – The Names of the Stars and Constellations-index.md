PREFACE .
The Author has hastily compiled the following notes
originally intended to form part of a small book, that he
hopes to publish later on, upon the Names connected with
the Stars and Constellations. He finds that otherwise he
runs every risk of being forestalled, and of losing all credit
for the arduous labours and research of
many
months .
Just as the Constellation, “ Canis Minor," was called “ Procyon " and " Antecanis," — meaning the “ Precursor-Dog ,"
from the fact of its rising before and giving warning of
“ The Sultry Dog - Star," " Sirius," or “ Canicŭlus” (whose appearance, in turn, foretold the Rising of the Nile to the
ancient Egyptians)—so this compilation may be looked upon as the Author's “ Probiblion ," or " Antelibellus " -his
“ Precursor book"—the publishing of which anticipates and
gives notice of the “ Liber " that he is preparing upon the
“ Names of the Stars and Constellations :" Latin, Greek,
Arabic, & c . (and which he trusts will not foretell the rising
of " nil " ).
Certain Star- names are met with in Lists or Tables, and
on Celestial Spheres or Charts. These are apparently in
some eastern language ; since, with a few exceptions, they
are obviously not Latin, Greek , or from any modern tongue. They appear to be put down without rule, and are often
much mutilated ; probably because writers have carelessly
copied from one another from time to time, and being ignorant



4
non
of the meaning of the Names have spelt them according to
fancy and at hap-hazard.
No English writer on Astronomy seems to have had any
interest in tracing these “ Star-Names ” to their original
languages, and thus assigning some meaning to them ; though they are pretty well known to be chiefly Arabic, however corrupted .
The compiler of this little work has endeavoured— “
sine magno labove " —to rescue these interesting relics of past ages, to discover the correct way of spelling them , and
thereby to elicit their original meanings. In short, he has laboured to extricate the original names
( first bestowed probably by Arabs in the level Desert, as
they lay awake during the sultry eastern nights, and sur
veyed in their clear skies the glittering stars in fanciful
Groups, and watched their risings and settings) from the
absurd corruptions and truncations due to the lapse of
centuries and to ignorance of the language from which they
have been taken .
Much information has been obtained from “ Ideler,” a
German, who wrote a work on the Arabic Star-names in
1810, but every name has also been worked out, with some aid from a scholar in Eastern tongues, and also indepen
dently, from the Arabic itself and other languages.
In conclusion the compiler begs to observe, that so far as
he can learn , the meanings of the Star-names from Arabic,
&c., have never before this been published in English, and
that he here offers information not known even to students
of the Stars and Constellations, and trusts that his “ Libellus"
may interest them and meet with a favourable reception not
only from them, but from the reading public generally.

ALPHABETICAL INDEX OF NAMES

INTRODUCTION .
It is customary among English Astronomers to designate
the Constellations by their Latin names ; for example the
group of stars known as “ The Swan ,” is called “ Cygnus."
The Group of “ The Lion ,'
"
«

,
"
&
c
.;
and
the
stars
forming
them
by
the
letters
of
the
Greek
alphabet
.

Where possible , each of the several stars in a constella
tion is indicated by a Greek letter — the largest being
denoted by the first letter of the Greek alphabet, the next
by the second letter, and so on.
These letters are employed to designate the stars of every
group, therefore it is necessary to distinguish the group to which any star belongs, and this is done by appending the
genitive case of the Latin name of the group. Thus,
the
first
star
of
“
The
Swan
"
is
known
as
“
Alpha
Cygni
”
(
a
Cygni
)
,
the
second
as
Beta
Cygni
,
&
c
.
And
when
(
as
often
happens
)
there
are
more
stars
in
a
group
than
the
above
twenty

four
Greek
letters
will
suffice
for
,
English
letters
and
numbers
are
employed
.
The constellations have not been set down here in
alphabetical order according to their Latin names, because
those groups, related to one another by mythology or by contiguity, being thereby separated would have had their
legendary connection rendered less obvious, and much
interest in them weakened or lost ; moreover the meanings
of some of the Arabic names would not be so readily under
stood and acknowledged, because there are some Arabic
names attached to stars in a certain constellation, which
from their meaning prove, (or at any rate make it probable)
that a particular star, when this name was first given to it,
was regarded as belonging to a neighbouring constellation. For instance, in the constellation " Andromeda ” or “ The
Chained Lady,” the largest star “ Alpha Andromedæ ,” bears on celestial spheres the Arabic name “ Alpherat ” or (Alpheratz).
This name cannot be translated so as to apply to “ An
dromeda,” but if we can believe that this star was imagined to form the fourth in the square of the adjacent “ Winged
Horse ” — “ Pegasus,” and was named accordingly, we can understand the meaning of “ Alpheratz ," and it is accordingly



9
derived from - Al = The, and Feras = a Horse, which clearly
apply to “ Pegasus." Again the star “ Pi Cygni” (1 Cygni) bears the name “ Azelfafge.” This is corrupted from
az zilf
Al
Al
The hoof
of the horse.
af Feras
The 1 of the Arabic article - Al - The, being often changed
into the same consonant as that beginning the substantive.
Thus we get-Az zilf af Feras, or by the elision of “ z ” and
“ f," azilfaferas, which became corrupted in the course of time into Azelfafge.
Now this name does not apply to “ The Swan ,” but
when it is seen that “ The Horse ” —Pegasus adjoins the
constellation of. “ The Swan ," we must believe that the leg
of “ Pegasus ” was once imagined to project down to the
star, “Pi Cygni," and that this star belonged to “ Pegasus,"
when the name was first assigned to it .
Let us commence with “ Ursa Major ” or “ The Great
Bear,” because it is the best known generally, and was
probably the group that was first observed by ancient
peoples. There is also most lore respecting it.
“
Ursa
Minor,"
•
The
Little
Bear
,
”
should
follow
naturally
in
the
second
place
,
both
from
its
adjacent
position
and
from
its
resemblance
to
“
The
Great
Bear
,
”
though
in
a
reversed
position
.
3 . “ Boötes , " “ The Bear-Ward," comes suitably third.
4. “ Draco," “ The Dragon," can no longer be delayed,
winding between “ The Bears ” as it does, and comes fourth .
5.
Hercules
,
“
The
Kneeler
,”
is
described
fifth
;
next
after
“
Draco
,
”
whose
head
has
one
star
in
this
constella
tion
.
2.

.
“
Ophiuchus
,
"
“
The

Bearer

sixth
.
The
heads
of
Hercules
and
Ophiuchus
have
the
two
stars
“
Rasalgethi
and
Rasalague

close
together
.
7. “ Serpens," " The Serpent,” should be described after
the Serpent- Bearer ; (even if the two groups were not closely
intermingled) and comes seventh .

.
“
Corona
Borealis
,"
or
the
“
Northern
Crown
,
"
comes
eighth
for
description
,
from
its
position
.
9. “ Lyra ," " The Lyre," comes ninth for a similar
reason .
II
.
12
.
10. “ Cygnus,” “ The Swan , " is the tenth ; being
generally seen at the same time as “ Lyra ; "
and " Aquila ,” or “ The Eagle, ” comes eleventh for the same reason .
“
Delphinus,"
“
The
Dolphin
,
”
is
conveniently
described
now
and
is
the
twelfth

and
now
we
come
to
the

Group
.
13. " Cepheus," " The King, "
14. “ Cassiopea ," his wife,
15. “ Andromeda,” their daughter - or “ The Chained
Lady , ”
16. and “ Perseus," her lover ; come thirteenth , four
teenth, fifteenth , and sixteenth .
17. “ Pegasus,” “ The Winged Horse," must
seventeenth, from his etymological connection with “ Andro
meda ” as explained before.
18. “ Auriga," “ The Charioteer," near Perseus, is the
eighteenth.
19. “ Orion ," " The Hunter, " nineteenth.
20. “ Lepus,” “ The Hare,” twentieth , as one of the
animals Orion hunted .
come



II
21
.
22 .
“ Columba ,” “ The Dove ,” below “ Lepus ” next.
“ Canis Minor , ” or “ The Little Dog ,” not long after
the Hunter, comes twenty-second.
23 “ Canis Major," " The Greater Dog,” should follow ,
lest he be jealous of his minor, and comes twenty-third .
24. " Argo Navis," “ The Ship Argo ” or “ Barque,” is
surely inseparable from the Dog (bark ), and is described
twenty - fourth.
25. “ Hydra ,” “ The Water Snake,” extending some
one hundred degrees, longs to be described and comes
twenty - fifth.
26. " Crater," “ The Goblet," and
27. “ Corvus, " “ The Crow ," being placed and perched upon “ Hydra ," cometwenty-sixth and seventh.
28. “ Eridanus, " “ The River," may flow on the twenty
eighth .
29. " Cetus," “ The Whale,” will feel at home near “ The River," and is the twenty-ninth ,
30. and “ Piscis Australis,” may keep his gigantic friend company in “ The Stream " and comes last.
The twelve Constellations of the Zodiac are described
after the Moonstations and independently of the above
thirty groups, which all contain one or more stars with
Arabic names clinging to them.
These thirty constellations were all known to the Ancients,
except “ Columba," which was added by “ Royer " A.D.
1680, in the seventeenth century ; strangely enough , the star
Alpha Columbæ ,” has a name which smacks of Arabic, Phact.

or
I have omitted “ Equŭleus," “ Sagitta , " “ Triangulum ,”
· Deltoton," “ Centaurus," “ Lúpus," “ Ara," and
“ Corona Australis," as containing no stars with names ;
though these seven groups are enumerated in Cicero's
Aratus, and formed part of the forty -eight ancient asterisms
known more than two thousand years ago , comprising the
twenty-nine groups I have mentioned, seven I have omitted ,
and twelve described under the Zodiac.

This was translated by the Saracens into Arabic in the
reign of the Kaliph Al Mamun at Bagdad, A.D. 813 to 832,
and called by them :
1. The " Almagest” and often , “ Ptolomy's Almagest;"
which is generally derived from the Arabic Al = the, and Greek - megistos = greatest — or “ The Very Great Work.”

5. The Poem of Aratus has been translated into Latin
by Cicero, B.c. 60, and by Cæsar Germanicus, A.D. 18.
The “ Alphonsine Tables ” were compiled in the reign of

Alphonso X. , King of Castile, when Spain was under the
Moors, about A.D. 1252 ; it is supposed, by the aid of Arabic
and Jewish Astronomers.
Some think the Arabic names, which the stars of large
magnitude bear, on our celestial globes, were given them probably by the Saracenic Astronomers in the ninth or
tenth centuries ; when they were cultivating and advancing
all the Sciences in the East and in Spain . They made both
catalogues and maps of the stars visible in their skies.
There are also some stars with Greek and Latin names ,
which are more easily traced than those of Arabic origin .
Latin names of stars are the following :-Castor, Pollux,
Polaris, Bellatrix, Regulus Vindemiatrix, Capella , Hædi, Aselli, Mira .
There are a few stars with Greek names , such as
