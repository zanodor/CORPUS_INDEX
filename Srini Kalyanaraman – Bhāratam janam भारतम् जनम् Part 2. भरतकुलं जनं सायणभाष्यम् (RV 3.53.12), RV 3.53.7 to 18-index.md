3.053.07 These (sacrificers) are the Bhojas, of whom the diversified An:girasas (are the priests); and the heroic sons of the expeller (of the foes of the gods) from heaven, bestowing riches upon Vis'va_mitra at the sacrifice of a thousand (victims), prolong (his) life. [These sacrificers are the Bhojas: ime bhoja_ an:giraso viru_pa_: bhoja_ = ks.atriya descendants of Suda_s, suda_sah ks.atriya, ya_gam kurva_n.ah, instituting the sacrifice at which the latter, Medha_tithi, and the rest of the race of an:giras were their ya_jakas, or officiating priests; the expeller: rudra, his sons are the maruts; sacrifice of a thousand victims: sahasrasave = the as'vamedha].
3.053.08 Maghavan becomes repeatedly (manifest) in various forms, practising delusions with respect to his own peculiar person; and invoked by his appropriate prayers, he comes in a moment from heaven to the three (daily rites), and, although observant of seasons, is the drinker (of the Soma) irrespective of season.
3.053.09 The great r.s.i the generator of the gods, the attracted by the deities, the overlooker of the leaders (at holy rites), Vis'va_mitra attested the watery stream when he sacrificed for Suda_s; Indra, with the Kus'ikas was pleased. [The generator of the gods: devaja_h = the generator of radiances or energies, tejasa_m janayita_; arrested the watery stream: astabhna_t sindhum arn.avam: he is said to have stopped the current of the confluence of the vipa_s/a_ and s'utudri rivers; indra with the kus'ikas was pleased: apriyayata kus'ikebhir Indra = kus'ikagotrotpannair r.s.ibhih saha, with the r.s.is of the kus'ika lineage, or it might be rendered, pleased by the Kus'ikas]. Note: Kuśika (ಕುಶಿಕ ):
1) [noun] the share or cutting blade of a plough; a plough-share Rebus Kuśika (कु थिक).—
kaḥ Name of the father or the grand-father of थिश्वाथमत्र (viśvāmitra). Ṛg-veda iii, 33, 5
3.053.10 Sages and saints overlookers of the leaders (of sacred rites), Kus'ikas, when the Soma is expressed with stones at the sacrifice, then exhilarating (the gods) with praises, sing the holy strain (aloud) like (screaming) swans, and, together with the gods, drink the sweet juice of the Soma.
3.053.11 Approach, Kus'ikas, the steed of Suda_s; animate (him), and let him loose to (win) riches (for the raja); for the king (of the gods) has slain Vr.tra in the East, in the West, in the North, therefore let (Suda_s) worship him in the best (regions) of the earth.
3.053.12 I have made Indra glorified by these two, heaven and earth, and this prayer of Vis'va_mitra protects the race of Bharata. [Made Indra glorified: indram atus.t.avam-- the verb is the third preterite of the casual, I have caused to be praised; it may mean: I praise Indra, abiding between heaven and earth, i.e. in the firmament].

3.053.13 The Vis'va_mitras have addressed the prayer to Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt; may he therefore render us very opulent. [The Vis'va_mitras: The bharatas, or descendants of Bharata, are descendants of Vis'va_mitra; Bharata is the son of S'akuntala_, the daughter of the sage, Visva_mitra (Maha_bha_rata A_diparva); Vasis.t.ha is the family priest of the Bharatas and was the restorer to dominion from which they had been expelled by the Pan~ca_las].
3.053.14 What do the cattle for you among the Ki_kat.as; they yield no milk to mix with the Soma, they need not the vessel (for the libation); bring them to us; (bring also) the wealth of the son of the usurer, and give us Maghavan, (the possessions) of the low branches (of the community). [The Ki_kat.as: (Nirukta 6.32) are people who do not perform worship, who are infidels, na_stikas; in countries inhabited by ana_ryas (ki_kat.a_ na_ma des'ona_ryaniva_sah); na tapanti gharma_n.i: harmyam = a house; gharma_n.i = a vessel termed maha_vi_ra used at the rite called pragr.hya: pragr.h ya_khya_ karmopa yuktam maha_vi_rapa_tram, which the cattle do not warm by yielding their milk to it; usurer: a_ bhara pramagandasya vedas: maganda = kusidin, or usurer, one who says to himself, the money that goes from me will come back doubled, and pra = a patronymic; low branches of the community: naica_s'a_kham, that which belongs to a low (ni_ca) branch, or class (s'a_kha); the posterity born of S'u_dras and the like].
3.053.15 The daughter of Su_rya given by Jamadagni gliding everywhere and dissipating ignorance, has emitted a mighty (sound), and has diffused ambrosial imperishable food among the gods. [Given by Jamadagni: jamadagni datta_ = given by the r.s;is maintaining a blazing jamat-jvalat, fire, agni; mighty sound: the sound of thunder or the like in the sky; food among the gods: as the prayers or exclamation which accompanies the burnt offering].

3.053.16 May she, gliding everywhere, quickly bring us food (suited) to the five races of men; may she, the daughter of the sun whom the grey-haired jamadagnis gave to me, (be) the bestower of new life. [Five races of men: pan~cajanya_su kr.s.t.is.u: five distinctions are restricted to human beings; hence, the reference may be to four castes and barbarians; daughter of the sun: paks.ya_, the daughter of Paks.a: paks.a nirva_hakasya, the distributor of the parts (of the year?), i.e. su_ryasya, of the sun; bestower of new life: navyam a_yur dadha_na, having new life or food: mama kurvan.a_ bhavatu].
3.053.17 May the horse be steady, the axle be strong, the pole be not defective, the yoke not be rotten; may Indra preserve the two yoke-pins from decay; car with uninjured felloes, be ready for us. [The horses: ga_vau gaccheta iti ga_vau as'vau: ga_va_ implies those who go, or, in this place, horses; car be ready for us: Vis'va_mitra being about to depart from the sacrifice of Suda_s, invokes good fortune for his conveyance].
3.053.18 Give strength, Indra, to our bodies; give strength to our vehicles; (give) strength to our sons and grandsons; that they may live (long); for you are giver of strength.
The expression Bhāratam janam भारतम् जनम् (RV 3.53.12) is a cultural identifier of life activities of the people of a maritime tract, seafaring merchants, as they moved from chalcolithic phase to metals age revolution in urban living. ca. 7th millennium BCE, they lived in Sapta Sindhu region and Sarasvati-Sindhu river basins. Both Himalayan rivers Sarasvati and Sindhu were maritime waterways, navigable rivers, ca. 4th m. BCE.

"Researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMS), Chennai, combined data from archaeology, radiocarbon dating, and river flows to study how settlements around the Indus Valley region had evolved from around 7000 BC till 1000 BC. Their analysis of 1,874 Indus region settlements has shown that the Indus urbanisation had three epicentres — Mehrgarh in present-day Baluchistan, Gujarat, and sites along an ancient river called the Ghaggar-Hakra in Haryana and Punjab.The findings, published in Current Science, a journal of the Indian
Academy of Sciences, dispute suggestions by international researchers that farming and
urbanisation in the region was driven by a “wave of advance” moving eastward,,.We’re
looking at large-scale patterns of how the Indus civilisation changed over time,” said Ronojoy Adhikari, a theoretical physicist at the IMS, who led a team that analysed geographic
movements of Indus region settlements over hundreds of years...The study shows a
“catastrophic reduction” in the number of sites in the Ghaggar-Hakra region around 1900
BCE. Over time, the Indus sites moved upstream, but they were smaller in size and appear to show a breakdown in large urbanisation. But the decline around Mehrgarh and Gujarat occurred at a much slower pace. Gujarat remained relatively unscathed during the GhaggarHakra collapse" http://mitchtestone.blogspot.in/2010/04/indus-valley-east-theorychallenged.html

The density of settlements along the Vedic River Sarasvati Basin is exemplified by the fact that 80% (of 2600 archaeological sites, including 414 sites mapped along Hakra River Basin



10
and over 300 sites of Gujarat) of Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) aka Indian Valley
Civilization.

The following excerpt from Mughal's survey of the Hakra River Basin provide a hydrological history of the Sutlej-Yamuna Divide explaining the perennial nature of the Hakra River flows in the early phases of the Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) Civilization. The indications are that the



15
flows in the Hakra River started to diminish ca. middle of the third millennium BCE (i.e. 2500 BCE) between Fort Abbas and Yazman (near Kudwala).

Hydrological history of Sutlej-Yamuna Divide points to Hakra as a perennial river in 4th millennium BCE
"Surveys. Our surveys were concentrated along 300 miles of the dry bed of the Hakra River, within an approximately 10 to 15-mile wide strip..Beginning at the Indian border near Fort Abbas, we covered 110 miles, to Fort Derawar...The highest concentration of sites was found around Fort Derawar and to its southwest (Fig. 7.1)... It is now clear that this is a key region for understanding the develomental stages of the Harappan (or Indus) Civilization. The sites. A total of 414 sites have been mapped along 300 miles of the Hakra River bed. They range in time from at least the fourth millennium BCE to the Medieval Period. The protohistoric sies fall into the various periods of development...The hydrological history of the Sutlej-Yamuna Divide has often been discussed during the last one hundred years. This is summarized by Lambrick (1964) and Wilhelmy (1969). However, the most recent reconstruction of the changing courses of the Sarasvati, as proposed by Bimal Ghose and his colleagues (1979 and 1980), will require confirmation by archaeological or other dateable evidence. On the Pakistan side, archaeological evidence now available overwhelmingly affirms that the Hakra was a perennial river through all its course in Bahawalpur during the fourth millennium BCE (Early Harappan Period). About the middle of the third millennium BCE, the water supply in the northeastern portion of the Hakra, roughly between Fort Abbas and Yazman (near Kudwala) was considerably diminished or cut-off. But, abundant water in the lower (southwestern) part of this stream was still available, apparently through a channel from the Sutlej; this is attested by the heavy clustering of sites in that area during the late third and early second millennium BCE (Mature and Late Harappan Periods respectively). About the end of the second, or not later than the beginning of the first millennium BCE, the entire course of the Hakra seems to have dried up and a physical environment similar to that of present day in Cholistan set in. This forced the people to abandon most of the Hakra flood plain. A few Painted Grey Ware settlements, most of them smaller than four hectares in size,



16
are located along the upper part of the Hakra River. These were sustained by a meager water supply reaching there with seasonal regularity from the Ghaggar."[Mughal, M. Rafique, 1982, Recent archaeological research in the Cholistan desert, in: Possehl, Gregory L., ed. 1982, Harappan Civilization, Oxford & IBH Publishing Co., New Delhi (p.84, p.94)(pp.84102)]

Ghaggar extends into the now dry bed of Hakra river in Bahawalpur Province, Cholistan, Pakistan. Hakra carried the water of the Sutlej and Sarasvati during the Bronze Age period.[Mughal, Mohammed Rafique (1997). Ancient Cholistan: Archaeology and architecture. Rawalpini.]
There are no archaeological sites south of Bahawalpur Province along Hakra river.
In a survey conducted by M.R. Mughal between 1974 and 1977, over 400 sites were mapped along 300 miles of the Hakra river.[Mughal in: Gupta, S. P. (ed.) (1995). The lost Sarasvati and the Indus Civilisation. Jodhpur: Kusumanjali Prakashan.] The majority of these sites were dated to the fourth or third millennium BCE.[Bryant, Edwin (2001). The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture. Oxford University Press.]

Over a thousand Indus civilization settlements found on the banks of this river led to the
hypothesis that the Ghaggar is the lost river Sarasvati of the Rig Veda and hence the ancient
settlements on its banks are the creation of ingenious Vedic Aryan’s. Previously the time
approximately fixed for drying of the Ghaggar being 1750 to 1900 BC, coinciding with the collapse of the Indus civilization that encouraged some scholars to link mythological stories of the lost River Sarasvati with the Ghaggar.
Puri and Verma (1998) have argued that the present-day Tons River was the ancient upperpart of the Sarasvati River, which would then had been fed with Himalayan glaciers. The terrain of this river contains pebbles of quartzite and metamorphic rocks, while the lower terraces in these valleys do not contain such rocks.[Puri, V. M. K.; Verma, B.C. (1998). "Glaciological and Geological Source of Vedic Saraswati in the Himalayas". Itihas Darpan IV (2): 7–36.]
The present-day Sarsuti (Saraswati River) originate in a submontane region (Ambala district) and joins the Ghaggar near Shatrana in Punjab. Near Sadulgarh (Hanumangarh) the Naiwal channel, a dried out channel of the Sutlej, joins the Ghaggar. Near Suratgarh the Ghaggar is then joined by the dried up Drishadvati (Chautang) river.
There is substantial geologic evidence to indicate that prior to 1700 BCE, and perhaps much earlier, the Sutlej was an important tributary of the Ghaggar-Hakra River (thought to be the legendary Sarasvati River) rather than the Indus, with various authors putting the redirection from 2500 to 2000 BCE,[1] from 5000 to 3000 BCE,[2] or before 8000 BCE.[3]
Geologists believe that tectonic activity created elevation changes which redirected the flow of Sutlej from the southeast to the southwest.[4] If the diversion of the river occurred recently (about 4000 years ago), it may have been responsible for the Ghaggar-Hakra (Saraswati) drying up, causing desertification of Cholistan and the eastern part of the modern state of Sindh, and the abandonment of Harappan settlements along the Ghaggar. However, the Sutlej may have already been captured by the Indus thousands of years earlier.
Further hydrological studies and historical mapping of seismotectonic events caused byh the Indian plate subducting into the Eurasian plate are needed to geologically validate the archaeologically dated ca. 2500 BCE as the date of desiccation of Vedic River Sarasvati due to plate tectonics and resultant river migrations.
Good geological pointers for such seismotectonic events are: 1. the 90-degree turn of Sutlej River at Ropar, a massive river migration comparable to the almost 180 degree turn recorded by River Brahmaputra (Tsangpo) at Manas, Arunachal Pradesh; and 2. Yamuna tear at Paonta Saheb caused by the lateral shift of Siwalik ranges.
