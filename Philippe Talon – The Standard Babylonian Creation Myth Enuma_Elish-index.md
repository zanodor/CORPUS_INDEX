ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The purpose of this book is to give the Assyriological community a pedagogic edition of one of the most important literary texts in the Akkadian language, known since antiquity as Enüma EUS. I would like to express my thanks to Simo Parpola and Robert Whiting for accepting it in the State Archives of Assyria Cuneiform Texts series. The sign list and the cuneiform version are the work of Robert Whiting, with the remarkable conversion programs of the State Archives of Assyria Project. Much of the layout of the transliteration and glossary has been superbly and expertly done by Robert Whiting and I am indebted to him for the many hours he spent on this book. My thanks also for the many helpful hints on better ways to handle the manuscript from him and Simo Parpola. The section “On the Present Volume” of the Introduction was provided by Robert Whiting. It is also a pleasure to thank some of those who have helped me, in different ways, in realizing this project: my students, who read Enüma EUS with me over the years; Cynthia Jean, Véronique Van der Stede and Nicolas Vanderroost, who helped me gather the manuscripts; Walther Sallaberger, who provided me with a reference unavailable in Brussels; Amar Annus, who offered some interesting readings and suggestions. This book would never have existed without the constant support and encouragement of my wife, Michèle Broze. I wish to dedicate it to my parents, who will never see it, but who freely let me take the strange path of Assyriology.

INTRODUCTION
The Babylonian Myth of Creation has been known to assyriologists for more than a century through the works of G. Smith, L. W. King and St. Langdon.1 With the discovery of more material, R. Labat gave a comprehensive edition and a commentary in 1935.2 W. G. Lambert started to collect the unpublished material in the British Museum and elsewhere and was able to give a prelimi nary cuneiform edition in 1966.3 This remarkable work has given every assyriologist the opportunity to read that important text in class and it remains unchallenged till this day. Since its publication, however, many new texts have come to light, the most important coming from Sultantepe and the Sippar Library. Almost forty years after its publication, Lambert's cuneiform text is still the unavoidable base for every reconstruction of Enüma EUS. W. G. Lambert himself has continued to gather the unpublished material and we can expect a definitive new treatment of this work in the near future. Nevertheless, many translations have been offered recently in various languages and it is always the burden of their authors to recompile all fragments and try to present an up-to-date version of the myth.
With the advent of the State Archives ofAssyria Cuneiform Texts, it seemed to me a good opportunity to publish a new version of Enüma EUS that would take into account all the available material and offer an update of Lambert’s 1966 cuneiform text, along with a glossary and sign list, as is usual in the series. 1 would like to express my deepest gratitude to Simo Parpola and Robert Whiting for accepting my proposal. But, as usual, I bear sole respon sibility for any mistakes, omissions or interpretations. My interest in Enüma EUS started a long time ago and, as probably all of us have, I read it several times with my students. I also tried to make it known to my colleagues in other fields during a seminar on the reading of myths in Antiquity at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, particularly because of the transmission of its tradition to later Neoplatonic philosophers.4 I was mainly interested in a literary and ideological understanding of the text, using grammatical and narrative means. A new insight was given to me by the reading of a note by H. L. J. Vanstiphout who organized the first eight lines

Labat, Le poème babylonien de la création, Paris, 1935. 3 W. G. Lambert and S. B. Parker, Enuma EUS. The Babylonian Epic o f Creation. The Cuneiform Text, Oxford, 1966. 4 One of the most striking features of thi s transmission is the fact that the Neoplatonic author Damascius (bom ca. AD 460) was still able to present a very precise description of the beginning of Enüma EUS several centuries after the disappearance of cuneiform writing; see my “Enüma EUS and the Transmission of Baby Ionian Cosmology to the West,” in R. M. Whiting (ed.), Mythology and Mythologies. Methodological Approaches to Fntercultural Influences, Melammu Symposia II, Helsinki, 2001, pp. 265-278.

ENÛMA ELIS
in two stanzas of four verses which gave them, in my opinion, more sense than the usual interpretation.5 I ran with the idea and applied it to what I have called the “first episode,” Tablet I 1-108.6 It appeared to me that this part of the poem is clearly a rehearsal of the main plot: Ea will fight and vanquish Apsû, creating a precedent that his son Marduk will accomplish later on a much more cosmic level. Its aim is to show that the son is much more powerful than his father and his creations much larger and widespread. Marduk will inherit his father’s name, and thus his powers, in Tablet VII, the last name that will be given to him (in fact the 52nd, after inheriting Enlil’s title). It came as a surprise that the organization of the poem in four-verse stanzas did indeed work very well, with only two cases where it was evidently impossible to maintain the system: lines 45-46 and 101-102. These two exceptions were easily explained as two-line stanzas intended to put emphasis on a particular point in the recitation/narrative. Lines 45-46 underline the fact that Tiamat, urged by Apsû to destroy the gods, decides to remain patient (ï nisdud fâbif) and the status quo may thus remain in effect. Nothing is decided. Lines 101-102 seem to be inserted into a stanza describ ing Marduk’s features but they represent a shout, a play on Marduk’s name, almost as if a choir were shouting them during the narrative stanza. The first episode thus contained only two, easily explainable, departures from the four-line rhythm in a total of 108 verses. The final stanza of this part (my stanza 1-26) marks a pause in the narrative. Apsû has been vanquished by Ea (whose name, interestingly, occurs for the first time in line 60, after being called Nudimmud earlier) and the neutral, balanced situation is re stored. The last words are a wonderful link to the main story: Anu creates the wave and udallab Tiamat “it was going to trouble Tiamat.” With all this in mind, I have attempted to continue the same analysis throughout the seven tablets. Surprisingly again, it seems to work remarkably well, with almost every case of deviation linked to a clear emphasis in a two-verse stanza. There are of course exceptions, mainly in the long section related to the 50 names of Marduk. Those stanzas have varying length, depending probably on the importance of the name and the wit of the author to play with the sounds and signs. Only in one instance have I felt the need to suggest a missing line, between lines 94 and 95 of Tablet VI. The structure of some parts of Tablet V which are very poorly preserved is of course a conjecture, but the number of lines fits with the four-line organization. It is now up to the reader to judge if the hypothesis is valid. In order to keep this edition comparable to Labat’s work, I have used the same sigla and continued his practice of giving letters to the manuscripts (a-z, then aa, bb, and so on), with uppercase letters for Neo-Assyrian script. The texts which have appeared since his edition are indicated as being “postLabat.” The transliteration offered here largely follows Lambert’s 1966 cuneiform text, but I have given priority to the published exemplars when the reading he proposed is clearly based on unpublished material.

INTRODUCTION
manuscripts exhibit a tendency to use syllabic signs instead of logograms, even in the case of very usual ones, like AD for ‘father’ or A.MES for ‘water.’ This should be studied in more detail, since it could be a sign of the need to give the reader a precise and unambiguous text, comparable mutatis mutandis with the addition of vowel marks in later sacred texts written in Hebrew, Syriac or Arabic. I have mostly kept the logograms in the composite text to reflect the orthographic tradition of Standard Babylonian Neo-Assyrian works. When the syllabic writings represent the better preserved text, they have of course been used. One cannot escape the fact that this composition is written in a remarkably simple way. Special or rare signs appear only in the Fifty Names section. There are no plays or esoteric writings and one can even find some reading glosses here and there. It seems clear that the author and his followers aimed at giving a clear and simple text to read. The difficulty lies not in the reading but in the interpretation of the contents.

On the Present Volume
Cuneiform Text and Sign List
As in previous volumes, the cuneiform text and sign list have been generated automatically from the composite transliteration provided by the author, using programs and fonts created by the SAA Project. However, in a departure from the format used for cuneiform text in the earlier SAACT volumes, the bitmap font previously used has been replaced by a scalable font with somewhat more elegant proportions, and restored and damaged signs are rendered differently. While solid black characters still represent text preserved in at least one manuscript and outline characters stand for restored text and correspond to items within square brackets in the transliteration, outline characters are now shown with shading indicating the destroyed area of the tablet. Partially preserved characters are now shown by a combination of solid and outline wedges with shading over the outline portion of the sign. Damaged signs are represented by gray characters and unrestorable portions of the text are indicated by shaded areas:

ENÛMA ELIS
An exception is [f]û and S[ü\ which are always represented as if they were (î) in the cuneiform text. Unidentified signs are not indicated (rx 1 and [*] are not represented in the cuneiform except by shading). It should be borne in mind that the indication of broken signs does not render the cuneiform text more “scientific” since the representations are for the most part merely stylized and symbolic. No attempt has been made to provide a wedge by wedge reconstruction of the preserved portions of signs. The primary purpose of the cuneiform text is pedagogic (either for classroom use or for self-study). Research on the cuneiform text itself can only be done from the original text publications or the original tablets (see the catalog of manuscripts, pp. xiii-xviii). The cuneiform text provided here is not adequate for that purpose. Furthermore, the text, being a composite from numerous fragments, almost certainly does not represent any ancient text that ever existed. The composite text is based on a score transliteration of all published fragments. The score itself, which is over 60 pages long, is not included in the volume for reasons of space. The sign list contains all the syllabic and logographic sign values occurring in the composite text and their frequencies. Again, since these frequencies are taken from a composite text, they should not be regarded as statistically significant. In many instances, even parts of the same line have been re covered from different texts that may have had different orthographic con ventions. The sign numbers given in boldface are those of R. Borger’s Assyrisch-babylonische Zeichenliste with minor modifications.
Variant apparatus
Rather than being collected at the bottom of the page as in previous SAACT volumes, the variant apparatus has been presented after each four-line stanza. This is in keeping with the author’s original layout of the text.
Translation
Another departure from the format of previous SAACT volumes is the presentation of a translation of the text. The present translation (in French) matches the layout of the text into (mostly) four-line stanzas.
Glossary and Indices
The glossary and indices (in French) were prepared by the author and refor matted by the SAA Project staff. The glossary contains all lexically iden tifiable words occurring in the composite text. Variants given only in the variant apparatus are not included in the glossary or other indices. The list of logograms was computer generated from the author’s glossary.

Manuscripts
R. Labat gave uppercase sigla to tablets written in Assyrian cuneiform and lowercase sigla to Babylonian ones, with no information as to provenience. His sigla have been kept here to allow uniformity. I have treated Lambert's cuneiform text as a manuscript in itself when there are no published sources to establish the lines.

TRANSLATION






Tablette I
Lorsqu’en haut, les cieux n’étaient pas nommés, qu’en bas la terre ne portait pas de nom, c’est Apsû qui était le premier, leur ancêtre, la créatrice était Tiamat, leur mère à tous.
Ils avaient mêlé ensemble leurs eaux, (mais) les pâtures n’étaient pas agglomérées, ni les cannaies étendues, lorsque les dieux - aucun n’avait encore paru n’avaient pas reçu de nom, les destins n’étaient pas fixés.
C’est alors que des dieux furent créés au milieu d’eux : Labmu et Lafoamu se manifestèrent, ils furent pourvus de noms. Pendant qu’ils grandirent et crurent en taille, An§ar et KiSar furent créés : ils leur étaient supérieurs.
Ils allongèrent les jours, additionnèrent les années : Anu était leur héritier, égal à ses parents, car AnSar avait rendu semblable à lui Anu, son fils, et de même Anu engendra Nudimmud, son reflet.
Nudimmud, de ses pères, c’était bien lui le maître : vaste d’entendement, intelligent, puissant de force, bien plus fort encore qu’AnSar qui avait engendré son père, il n ’avait pas d’égal parmi les dieux, ses pairs.
lis se liguèrent, les pairs, les dieux. C’est Tiamat qu’ils troublaient en poussant sans cesse leur clameur ; ils perturbaient le coeur de Tiamat, par leur jeu bruyant, ils jetaient la confusion dans l’Anduruna.
Apsû était dans l’incapacité de réduire leur vacarme et même Tiamat restait silencieuse devant eux. Bien que leurs actions lui fussent pénibles, leur conduite n’était pas bonne, tous deux leur restaient (néanmoins) bienveillants.
C’est alors qu’Apsû, l’ancêtre des grands dieux, appela Mummu, son messager. Il lui disait : « Mummu, messager qui rend heureux mon coeur, viens, rendons-nous auprès de Tiamat ! »
Ils allèrent s’asseoir devant Tiamat et tinrent conseil en paroles au sujet des dieux, leurs fils. Apsû ouvrit la bouche et à Tiamat s’adressait d’une voix forte :

« L eur conduite m ’a été pénible, à m oi, • le jo u r, je ne puis m e rep o ser, la nuit, je ne puis dorm ir. Je veux détruire et anéantir leur conduite, afin que règne le silence et que nous, nous puissions dormir ! » 40
Tiamat, en entendant cela, • se mit en colère puis cria sur son amant. Elle cria douloureusement - elle était seule à fulminer car il avait jeté le mal en son sein :
« Pourquoi donc, nous, devrions-nous détruire ce que nous avons 45 • créé? Leur conduite, certes, est pénible, mais restons encore patients ! »
Mummu répondit et conseillait Apsû. • D’un messager sans bienveillance était le conseil de son Mummu : « Détruis donc, mon père, cette conduite perturbatrice, afin que tu puisses te reposer le jour et dormir la nuit ! » 50
Apsû se réjouit de lui et son visage s’éclaira ♦ à cause du mal qu’il avait comploté contre les dieux, ses fils. Il enlaça alors le cou de Mummu et celui-ci s’assit sur ses genoux, tandis que lui l’embrassait.
Tout ce qu’ils avaient comploté ensemble, 55 • on vint le répéter aux dieux, leurs fils. Les dieux l’entendirent et s’agitèrent de désespoir, puis le silence les saisit et ils s’assirent consternés.
Mais le très intelligent, le sage, le très capable, • Ea, savant en toute chose, perçait leurs intentions. 60 Il conçut contre lui un plan complet, le mit au point, le rendit parfait : prééminente était sa sainte incantation.
Il la récita contre lui et l’apaisa dans les eaux, • le sommeil l’envahit : il dormait en paix. Il fit s’endormir Apsû, engourdi de sommeil, 65 Mummu, le conseiller, était assoupi, harassé.
Il défit ses vêtements après lui avoir ôté sa tiare, • il emporta son aura divine, lui-même s’en revêtit. Il enchaîna Apsû et le mit à mort après avoir enfermé Mummu et tiré sur lui le verrou. 70
Il établit fermement sur Apsû sa demeure. * Après avoir empoigné Mummu, il le tint en laisse. Dès qu’il eut enchaîné et abattu ces deux méchants, Ea dressa son triomphe sur ses adversaires.
A l’intérieur de sa chambre, il se reposa, sereinement, 75 • il la nomma Apsû et en manifesta les sanctuaires. Au même endroit, il fonda sa cella, Ea et Damkina, son épouse, y siégèrent en majesté.

TRANSLATION - TA B LET I
D ans la chapelle des destins, la cella des desseins divins, • 1-20 fut engendré l ’expert des experts, le Sage des dieux, le Seigneur. 80 Au coeur de l’Apsû fut créé Marduk, au coeur du très saint Apsû fut créé Marduk.
C’est Ea, son père, qui le créa, • 1-21 Damkina, sa mère, est celle qui accoucha de lui. C o m m e il a v a it su c é le s e in d e s d é e s s e s , 85 la n o u rric e , en l ’é le v a n t, rem plit d’éclat te r rif ia n t.
Somptueuse est sa stature, étincelant est son regard, • 1-22 il est viril dès la naissance, puissant depuis toujours. Anu le vit, lui qui avait créé son père, il exulta, s’illumina et son coeur fut rempli de joie. 90
Comme il l ’avait rendu parfait, sa divinité est différente, • 1-23 il est beaucoup plus élevé, il leur est supérieur en toute chose. Inconcevables et magnifiques sont ses dimensions, impossibles à comprendre, difficiles à contempler.
Au nombre de quatre sont ses yeux, au nombre de quatre ses oreilles, 95 • 1-24 quand il remue les lèvres, le feu jaillit de toutes parts. Puisqu'il a grandi quatre fois plus intelligent, alors ses yeux, comme lui (Anu), peuvent contempler l’univers entier.
Il est élevé au-dessus des dieux, plus grande est sa stature, ses membres sont très longs, supérieure est sa naissance. « Mariutu, Mariutu, fils du Soleil, Soleil des dieux ! » Il est revêtu de l ’aura de dix dieux, il en est coiffé altièrement, les cinquante terreurs s’entassent sur lui.
Ànu créa et enfanta les quatre vents. 105 • 1-26 Il les confie à sa main : « Que mon fils les fasse virevolter ! » Il conçut la poussière, la fit emporter par la tempête, Il fit exister la vague, elle allait troubler Tiamat.
Troublée, elle l’était, Tiamat, car jour et nuit ils s ’agitaient, • 1-27 les dieux, et sans lui laisser de repos portaient contre elle les vents. 110 Alors eux, ayant comploté le mal en leur coeur, ils s’adressèrent à Tiamat, leur mère :
« Lorsqu’on assassina Apsû, ton amant, tu n’es pas allé à son secours, tu es restée silencieuse. Et voilà qu’il (Anu) a créé 4 Vents de Terreur : ils troublent ton coeur et nous, nous ne pouvons plus dormir
N’est-il plus dans ton coeur, Apsû, ton amant ? • 1-29 Et Mummu, qu’on a enchaîné ? Tu restes toute seule. N’es-tu pas notre mère ? Tu t’agites, troublée, mais nous, qui ne trouvons plus le repos, ne nous aimes-tu donc plus ? 120

Elle entendit, Tiamat, ces paroles lui plurent : 125 • 1-31 « Tout ce que vous avez décidé, faisons-le aujourd’hui ! » Ils rejoignirent son camp, les dieux, et ils se “blindaient” de vilénies contre les dieux qui les avaient créés.
Ils formèrent un cercle, debout auprès de Tiamat, ♦ 1-32 furieux, ils complotaient, sans prendre de repos, nuit et jour, 130 prêts au combat, ils trépignaient de rage, rassemblés en conseil, ils créent leur plan de bataille.
La mère JJubur, celle qui a tout créé, • 1-33 se dota d’une arme sans pareille en enfantant des Dragons : Leurs dents sont acérées, leurs mâchoires sans pitié, 135 elle avait empli leur corps de venin au lieu de sang.
Les féroces Serpents Géants, elle les revêtit de terreur • 1-34 ils étaient chargés d’aura divine, car elle les avait rendus semblables à des dieux : « Que ceux qui les contemplent s’effondrent sans force, qu’ils lancent leur corps à l’attaque, sans jamais reculer ! » 140
Elle fit surgir BaSmu, le Dragon et Labamu, • 1-35 Ugallu, Uridimmu et l’Homme-Scorpion, les Féroces Tempêtes, l’Homme-Poisson et le Bison, porteurs d’armes sans pitié, sans peur au combat.
Ses ordres sont gigantesques, ils n’ont pas leur pareil : 145 • 1-36 En vérité, en ayant bien créé onze, comme Lui (Marduk), parmi les dieux, ses fils, ceux qui s’étaient rassemblés autour d’elle, elle éleva Kingu, fit de lui le plus grand d’entre eux.
Le leadership, le commandement, la direction du conseil, • 1-37 brandir les armes dans la mêlée, lancer l’assaut, 150 le commandement suprême sur tous les combattants, c’est à lui qu’elle le remit, elle l’installa sur le trône du chef :
« J ’ai jeté sur toi un sort, je t’ai magnifié dans le conseil des dieux, • 1-38 j ’ai placé entre tes mains la souveraineté sur la totalité des dieux. Sois donc le plus grand ! Tu es mon seul amant ! 155 Que ton nom l’emporte partout sur tous les Anunnaki ! »
Elle lui remit la Tablette des Destin, l’ayant fixée à sa poitrine : • 1-C « Que de toi, la parole soit inaltérable ! Que ton verbe soit éternel ! »
Maintenant que Kingu est élevé, il possède le pouvoir suprême, • 1-39 il décrète le destin pour les dieux, ses fils : 160 « Que vos paroles apaisent le feu, que ton venin accumulé rende impotente la tyrannie ! »

Tiamat mit ainsi la dernière main à son oeuvre, • 2-1 en alignant pour la guerre les dieux, sa progéniture. Désormais, plus qu’Apsû, Tiamat fut mauvaise. Mais le combat, tel qu’il avait été préparé, se révéla à Ea.
Ea les entendit, ces paroles, 5 *2- 2 il resta silencieux, sans réaction, demeura comme prostré, mais ayant réfléchi, il calma sa colère et s ’en fut, lui-même, auprès d’AnSar, son père.
Il entra en présence d’AnSar, le père qui l’avait engendré, • 2-A et tout ce que Tiamat avait comploté, il le lui répète : 10
« Mon père, Tiamat, notre mère, nous a pris en haine, • 2-3 son conseil est réuni, elle écume de rage, tous les dieux ont tourné autour d’elle, même ceux que vous avez créés marchent à ses côtés.

Elle lui remit la Tablettes des Destin, l’ayant fixé à sa poitrine : • 2-B « Que de toi, la parole soit inaltérable ! Que ton verbe soit éternel ! »
Maintenant que Kingu est élevé, il possède le pouvoir suprême, 45 • 2-11 il décrète le destin pour les dieux, ses fils : « Que vos paroles apaisent le feu, que ton venin accumulé rende impotente la tyrannie ! »
AnSar entendit ce discours, il le trouble grandement, • 2-12 après avoir crié « Malheur! », après s’être mordu les lèvres, 50 son coeur est en colère, son âme sans repos ; mais contre Ea, son fils, son hurlement perd de sa force :
« Mon fils, ce que tu as provoqué par ton hostilité, c’est la guerre, • 2-13 tout ce que tu as fait de ton côté, c’est à toi à le subir ! Tu es allé tuer Apsû 55 et maintenant, Tiamat que tu as mise hors d’elle, où est son égal ? »
Sage de conseil, prince du discernement, • 2-14 créateur de la sagesse, le divin Nudimmud, d’une parole apaisante, d’un mot de réconfort, répond gentiment à son père AnSar : 60
« Mon père, coeur profond qui fixe le destin, • 2-15 le pouvoir de créer et de détruire t’appartient. AnSar, coeur profond qui fixe le destin, le pouvoir de créer et de détruire t’appartient.
Je vais te dire un mot, commence par te calmer, 65 • 2-16a ce que j ’ai fait était bon, comprends-le bien : avant que moi-même, je ne tue Apsû, • 2-17 qu’y avait-il à voir ? Maintenant, il y a tout cela ! avant que je ne me hâte pour l’anéantir par moi-même - car lui, je l’ai bien fait disparaître ! -, qu’est-ce qui existait ? » 70 AnSar l’écouta et cette parole lui plut, ♦ 2-16b son coeur apaisé, il s’adresse à Ea :

et suivant son chemin, il prit la route. 80
Ea s’en alla découvrir les plans de Tiamat, • 2-20 mais il s’arrêta, frappé de stupeur, et revint en arrière. 11 entra en présence du noble AnSar et l’implorant par ces mots, il lui dit :
« Mon père, comme Tiamat a rendu ses oeuvres plus fortes que moi, 85 • 2-21 bien que j ’aie cherché sa route, ma magie n’est pas de taille. Vaste est sa force, elle n’est plus que terreur, son assemblée est puissante, personne ne peut marcher contre elle !
Son cri d’alerte ne faiblit pas : « Stop ! » • 2-22 J ’ai pris peur à son cri et j ’ai fait demi-tour. 90 Mon père, ne faiblis pas, envoie encore quelqu’un contre elle ! Même si la force d’une femme est grande, elle n’égale pas celle d’un homme !
Disperse son armée, anéantis ses plans, • 2-23 avant qu’elle ait pu mettre les mains sur nous ». AnSar se met à hurler de colère 95 et s ’adresse à son fils Anu :
« Mon fidèle héritier, héros à l’arme invincible, dont vaste est la force, irrésistible l’assaut, mets-toi en route et va toi-même te dresser au-devant de Tiamat ; apaise son coeur, qu’elle se détende.
Mais si elle ne voulait pas entendre tes paroles, addresse-lui une supplique afin qu’elle se calme ». Il écouta les paroles de son père AnSar et suivant son chemin, il prit la route.
Anu s’en alla découvrir les plans de Tiamat, 105 • 2-26 mais il s ’arrêta, frappé de stupeur, et revint en arrière. Il entra en présence de son père AnSar et l ’implorant par ces mots, il lui dit :

Ils sont rassemblés, tous les Igigi et les Anunnaki, mais leurs lèvres sont closes, ils restent muets. Aucun dieu n’ose y aller de sa parole (?), pour affronter Tiamat, aucun n’ose ouvrir les lèvres.
Alors qu’AnSar, le père des grands dieux, 125 ruminait sa colère, personne ne disait rien. Il y avait (pourtant) le courageux héritier, vengeur de son père, celui qui se rue à la bataille, le vaillant Marduk.
Ea l’appela en un lieu secret et lui dit ce qui lui tenait à coeur : 130 « Marduk, écoute le conseil de ton père, c’est toi, mon fils, qui va le réconforter.
Auprès d’AnSar, approche-toi, tout près, parle-lui debout, à te voir il sera apaisé ». Le Seigneur se réjouit des paroles de son père, 135 il s’approcha et se dressa devant AnSar.
AnSar le vit, son coeur s’emplit de joie il lui baisa les lèvres, ses craintes envolées.
« Mon père, ne ferme pas, mais ouvre au contraire tes lèvres, c’est moi qui irai satisfaire ton désir. 140 AnSar, ne ferme pas, mais ouvre au contraire tes lèvres, c’est moi qui irai satisfaire ton désir.
Quel homme a, contre toi, engagé la lutte ? » « Mon fils, c’est Tiamat, une femme, qui vient contre toi en armes ! »
« Mon père, Créateur, réjouis-toi et pousse des cris de joie, 145 car très bientôt tu pourras piétiner toi-même la nuque de Tiamat. Mon père, Créateur, réjouis-toi et pousse des cris de joie, car très bientôt tu pourras piétiner toi-même la nuque de Tiamat ».
« Va, fils, toi qui connais toute sagesse, apaise Tiamat de ta sainte incantation. 150 Mets en route en toute hâte le char des tempêtes, mais si [son assaut] ne peut être repoussé, fais demi-tour ! »
Le Seigneur se réjouit des paroles de son père, le coeur en joie, il s’adresse à son père :
« Maître des dieux, destin des grands dieux, 155 si moi, je deviens votre vengeur, pour que je puisse enchaîner Tiamat et vous rendre la vie, tenez une assemblée et proclamez suprême mon destin !
Dans l’Up§ukkinakku, siégez tous ensemble joyeusement, que ma parole soit comme la vôtre, que je puisse décréter le destin, 160 que soit inaltérable tout ce que moi, j ’aurai créé, que ne puissent être révoqués ni modifiés les mots issus de mes lèvres ! »

Ils élevèrent pour lui une estrade princière et en présence de ses pères, il y prit place en souverain.

A partir de ce jour, ta parole sera inaltérable élever ou abaisser, cela sera en ton pouvoir, ton ordre sera éternel, tes mots ne tromperont pas, personne parmi les dieux ne pourra outrepasser les limites que tu 10 imposeras !

Lorsque tu siégeras au conseil, ta parole sera éminente, 15 1 que tes armes ne manquent jamais leur but, qu’elles anéantissent tes ennemis ! Seigneur, sauve la vie de celui qui met en toi sa confiance, mais le dieu qui a conçu le mal, répands sa vie ! »

En contemplant l’effet de sa parole, les dieux, ses pères, 4 se réjouirent et le bénirent : « Marduk seul est roi ! » Ils le dotèrent encore du sceptre, du trône et du cycle royal, ils lui donnèrent une arme irrésistible, capable de renverser l’adversaire. 30
« Va et tranche la gorge de Tiamat, 4 que les vents emportent son sang en des lieux inconnus ! » C’est ainsi qu’ils décrétèrent le destin du Seigneur, les dieux ses pères, en lui faisant prendre une route faite de perfection et d’harmonie.

Il façonna un arc, qu’il manifesta comme son arme, 35 • 4-9 et pour y faire chevaucher la flèche, il mit en place la corde. Il brandit la masse d’armes, la saisit de sa droite, il suspendit à son côté l’arc et le carquois.
Il mit l’éclair devant lui, après s’être empli le corps de flammes ardentes, il créa le filet - c’est pour envelopper Tiamat -, il s’équipa des Quatre Vents - rien d’elle ne pourra s’échapper
Le Vent du Sud, le Vent du Nord, le Vent d’Est, le Vent d’Ouest, • 4-11 cadeau de son père Anu, il se les mit au côté, tout près du filet. Il créa le Vent mauvais, la Tempête, la Tornade, 45 le Vent Quadruple, le Vent Septuple, le Tourbillon, le Vent Irrésistible.
Il fit sortir les vents qu’il avait créés, tous les sept, • 4-12 ils s’élancent derrière lui pour perturber Tiamat, le Seigneur brandit aussi le Déluge, sa grande arme, et monta dans le char effrayant « Tempête irrésistible ». 50
Il harnacha et y attela un quadruple attelage : *4-13 Tueur, Impitoyable, Piétineur, Ailé, leurs gueules sont béantes, leurs dents portent du venin, ils ne connaissent pas la fatigue, ils ne savent que dévaster.
Il fit surgir à sa droite Combat Redoutable et Bataille, 55 • 4-14 à sa gauche la Guerre qui éparpille toute coalition, il est revêtu d’une cotte de mailles inspirant la terreur, il est coiffé de l’Aura qui provoque l’épouvante.
Allant de l’avant, le Seigneur prit la route et vers Tiamat, qui enrageait, il décida de se rendre Sur ses lèvres, il tenait prête l’incantation, dans son poing, il tient la plante qui éteint le poison
A ce moment précis, ils lui tournaient autour, les dieux lui tournaient autour, «4-16 les dieux, ses pères, lui tournaient autour, les dieux lui tournaient autour. S’étant approché, le Seigneur contemplait les entrailles de Tiamat, 65 et de Kingu, son amant, il cherchait à percer les ruses.
Mais à les contempler, sa démarche se trouble, • 4-17 sa volonté s’égare et son plan d’action vole en éclat, quant aux dieux, ses alliés, qui allaient à ses côtés, ils virent le héros, le chef, et leur vision se troubla. 70
Tiamat jeta un sortilège, elle ne voulait pas céder, «4-18 et sur ses lèvres, cet être informe n ’avait que mensonges : « [...] du Seigneur, les dieux sont dressés contre toi ! Ils se sont groupés entre eux, ils sont auprès de toi ».
Le Seigneur brandit le Déluge, sa grande arme, 75 • 4-A et à Tiamat qui fulminait, il s’adressa ainsi :

TRANSLATION - TA B LET IV
« Pourquoi, alors qu’avant tu manifestais de bons sentiments, maintenant ton coeur complote-t-il de lancer l’assaut ? Les enfants ont crié (c’est vrai), ils ont malmené leurs pères, mais toi, leur mère à tous, tu as rejeté toute pitié ! 80
Tu as nommé Kingu pour qu’il soit ton amant, tu l’as installé d’une manière inconvenante au pouvoir suprême. Contre An§ar, le roi des dieux, tu as cherché à faire le mal, et même aux dieux, mes pères, tu as prouvé ta méchanceté.
Que ton armée se harnache, qu’eux ceignent tes armes, 85 approche-toi, que toi et moi, nous nous battions en duel ! »
Tiamat, en entendant cela, devint comme folle, son esprit s’altéra. Elle cria avec fureur, Tiamat, d’une voix haut perchée, jusqu’aux racines, totalement, elle trembla sur ses bases. 90
Elle récitait des incantations, lançait de toutes parts ses sortilèges, mais les dieux de la guerre, eux, aiguisaient leurs armes. Il s’approcha de Tiamat, le Sage des dieux, Marduk, ils se sont entrecroisés en duel, s’étant approchés l ’un l’autre dans la mêlée.
Le Seigneur déploya son filet et l’en enveloppa, 95 il lâcha sur elle le Vent Mauvais - il tenait ses arrières - ; Tiamat ouvrit la bouche pour l’avaler, le Vent Mauvais s’y engouffra pour l’empêcher de fermer la gueule.
Les vents furieux lui remplirent le ventre, de sorte que son coeur se gonfla, la gueule grande ouverte. 100 11 décocha une flèche, lui brisant ainsi le ventre, il lui découpa la panse et lui trancha le coeur.
Il l’enchaîna et mit fin à sa vie, il jeta bas son cadavre et se dressa sur elle.
Dès qu’il eut tué Tiamat, le chef, 105 ses troupes se débandèrent, toute cohésion disparue, et même les dieux, ses alliés, qui marchaient avec elle, tremblèrent, furent pris de panique et rebroussèrent chemin.
Ils prirent la fuite pour sauver leur vie, mais cernés, encerclés, sans aucune possibilité de fuite, 110 il les captura et brisa leurs armes, enveloppés dans le filet, ils étaient tout entassés.
Relégués dans les coins, pleins de gémissements, ils portent sa laisse, croupissent en prison.
Quant aux onze créatures qui étaient emplies de terreur, 115 la horde de démons qui tous marchaient à sa droite, après avoir attaché leurs bras, il les enchaîna, malgré toute leur aggressivité, il les foula aux pieds.

Quant à Kingu, qui était devenu parmi eux le plus grand, 9 4-28 il Tenchaîna et le mit au nombre des Dieux Morts, 120 il lui arracha la Tablette des Destins, sur laquelle il n'avait aucun droit, la scella de son sceau et la fixa à sa poitrine.
Après avoir enchaîné et abattu ceux qui lui voulaient du mal, • 4-29 et subjugué ses puissants adversaires comme un taureau, il dressa totalement sur ses ennemis le triomphe d’AnSar 125 et réalisa le désir de Nudimmud, lui Marduk, le Héros :
Sur les dieux enchaînés il renforça son emprise • 4-E et retourna auprès de Tiamat qu'il avait enchaînée.
Le Seigneur piétina la base de Tiamat • 4-30 et de sa masse, il lui fendit le crâne, 130 il découpa les veines de son sang que le vent du nord emporta en des lieux inconnus.
Voyant cela, ses pères se réjouirent et exultèrent, • 4-31 offrandes et cadeaux, ils lui apportèrent, à lui. Le Seigneur s'apaisa et contempla son cadavre, 135 il partage le monstre et se met à créer des merveilles.
Il la brisa en deux parties comme un poisson séché, • 4-32 mit en place la moitié et en couvrit le ciel. Il tira le verrou et établit une garde, leur ayant ordonné de ne pas laisser sortir ses eaux. 140
Il traversa le ciel, en examina les lieux, • 4-F pour en faire l'équivalent de l’Apsû, séjour de Nudimmud.
Il mesura les structures de l’Apsû, le Seigneur, • 4-33 et comme un sanctuaire jumeau, il fonda l’ESarra. Le sanctuaire ESarra, qu’il avait créé, c’est le ciel : 145 Il y installa les chapelles d’Anu, d’Enlil et d’Ea.

Il créa une station pour les grands dieux, fit surgir des étoiles, des astres à leur image. Il fit connaître l’année, en dessina le plan et pour les douze mois, fit surgir 3 étoiles pour chacun.
Dès le jour où il dessina les plans de l’année, il fonda la station de Jupiter afin de manifester leur liens, et pour que personne ne commette de faute ou de négligence, il établit avec elle la station d’Enlil et d’Ea.
Il ouvrit de grandes portes des deux côtés, renforça le verrou à gauche et à droite. Ayant dans son corps-même situé les zones supérieures, il fit apparaître la Lune et lui confia la nuit.
Il lui fit connaître le bijou de la nuit afin de manifester les jours : « Chaque mois, sans interruption, dessine au moyen de la tiare, pour briller au début de chaque mois au-dessus du pays, tu éclaires les cornes afin de manifester 6 jours.
Le septième jour, la tiare sera à moitié, le 15ème jour, qu’elle soit en équilibre, au milieu de chaque mois. Lorsque Sama§ te verra à la base des deux, comme il convient, diminue et croîs à rebours.

Lorsque Marduk entendit les paroles des dieux, • 6-1 voilà que son coeur le porte à créer des merveilles. Il adresse un discours à Ea et lui donne le plan qu’il a échafaudé en son coeur :
« Je vais condenser du sang et faire exister les os, 5 • 6-2 je vais faire surgir un être, son nom sera Homme, je vais créer l’être, l’Homme, que lui soit imposée la corvée des dieux et qu’eux-même soient en repos !
Je vais à nouveau perfectionner les conditions d’existence des dieux, • 6-3 ils sont honorés ensemble, qu’ils soient partagés en deux. » 10 Ea lui répondit et lui dit une parole, au sujet de l’apaisement des dieux, il lui communique son idée :
« Que me soit donné un de leurs frères, • 6-4 que celui-là soit abattu et que soient façonnés les gens. Que les grands dieux se réunissent 15 et que soit livré le coupable, afin qu’eux-même soient assurés. »
Marduk rassembla les grands dieux, • 6-5 il les instruit avec bienveillance, leur donne instruction. Les dieux prêtent attention à ses déclarations, le Roi s’adresse aux Anunnaki : 20
« Certes, il est vrai, votre discours précédent ! • 6-A La vérité encore ! Dites-la moi !
Quel est celui qui a créé le conflit, • 6-6 qui a fait se révolter Tiamat et organisé le combat ? Que me soit donné celui qui a créé le conflit, 25 je vais lui faire porter son châtiment. Siégez tranquilles ! »
Ils répondirent, les Igigi, les grands dieux, • 6-7 à Lugal-dimmer-ankia, le roi des dieux, leur seigneur : « C’est Kingu qui a créé le conflit, qui a fait se révolter Tiamat et organisé le combat ! » 30
Ils l’enchaînèrent et le tinrent devant Ea, • 6-8 ils lui imposèrent le châtiment, ayant tranché ses veines. De son sang, il créa l’humanité, il lui imposa la corvée des dieux et libéra les dieux.
Après qu’Ea le sage eut créé l’humanité, 35 • 6-9 ils lui imposèrent, à elle, la corvée des dieux :



ENÛMA ELIS
Cette oeuvre, il est impossible de la comprendre, c’est grâce aux merveilles de Marduk que Nudimmud l’a créée !
Marduk, le Roi, divisa les dieux, • 6-B tous les Anunnaki, en haut et en bas : 40
Il assigna à Anu de garder ses instructions, • 6-10 et organisa une garde de 300 dans le ciel. De la même manière, il conçut les règles de la terre et en installa 600 dans le ciel et sur la terre.
Après qu’il eut donné toutes ses instructions 45 *6-11 et divisé les lots échus aux Anunnaki du ciel de la terre, les Anunnaki ouvrirent la bouche, s’adressant eux-mêmes à Marduk, leur seigneur :
« Maintenant, Seigneur, toi qui as réalisé notre affranchissement, • 6-C quel sera notre bienfait pour toi ? » 50
« Faisons le sanctuaire dont le nom est nommé, • 6-12 que dans ta cella soit notre lieu d’étape, puissions-nous nous y reposer ! Fondons le sanctuaire où sera le trône, le jour où nous y viendrons, puissions-nous nous y reposer ! »
Lorque Marduk entendit cela, 55 *6-13 ses traits s’éclairèrent grandement, comme le jour : « Faites Babylone, le travail que vous souhaitez, que son briquetage soit façonné, élevez bien haut le sanctuaire ! »
Les Anunnaki frappèrent de la houe, • 6-14 la première année, ils moulèrent ses briques. 60 Quand arriva la deuxième année, De l’Esagil, image de l’Apsû, la tête était élevée.
Ils construisirent la haute ziggurat de l’Apsû *6-15 et assurèrent une résidence pour Anu, Enlil, Ea et Lui-même. Lui s’installa devant eux en majesté, 65 à la base de l’ESarra, on en voyait les cornes.
Lorsqu’ils eurent accompli le travail de l’Esagil, • 6-16 tous les Anunnaki se construisirent des sanctuaires pour eux-mêmes - 300 Igigi des cieux et 600 de l’Apsû étaient tous rassemblés -. Le Seigneur était dans le sanctuaire éminent qu’ils avaient bâti pour lui, 70 il fit siéger les dieux, ses pères, à son banquet.
« Voici Babylone, lieu de votre résidence, • 6-17 Chantez-y joyeusement, siégez dans la joie ! » Ils s’installèrent, les grands dieux, posèrent leur chope et siégèrent au banquet. 75
Après y avoir fait la fête, • 6-18 eux-mêmes se firent une offrande de présentation dans le terrible Esagil.
100



Toutes les instructions et desseins sont désormais assurés, tous les dieux ont partagé les stations du ciel et de la terre.
Les grands dieux, à cinquante, prirent place 80 • 6-19 les dieux des destins, à sept, fixèrent les sentences. Le Seigneur présenta alors l’Arc, son arme, et le jeta devant eux, ils virent le filet qu’il s’était fait, les dieux, ses pères.
Ils virent l’Arc, combien était parfaite sa forme, • 6-20 ses pères louèrent les actes qu’il avait accomplis. 85 Anu l’éleva et prit la parole dans l ’assemblée des dieux, ayant embrassé l’Arc, <il dit) : « C’est bien ma fille ! »
De l’Arc, il nomma ainsi les noms : • 6-21 « Long bois », que ce soit le premier ; que le deuxième soit « Conquérant », son troisième nom est « Etoile de l’Arc », il la fit apparaître dans le ciel, 90 il fixa sa position parmi les dieux, ses frères.
Après qu’Anu eut décrété les destins de l’Arc, • 6-22 il instaura un trône royal, élevé parmi les dieux, et Anu le fit s’asseoir, lui, dans l’assemblée des dieux. <...> ?
Les grands dieux se réunirent 95 • 6-23 et, comme le destin de Marduk est le plus haut, eux se prosternèrent. Ils prononcèrent sur eux-mêmes une malédiction, jurèrent par l ’eau et par l’huile et se touchèrent la gorge.
TRANSLATION - T A B LET VI
Ils lui donnèrent d’exercer la royauté sur les dieux, • 6-24 ayant assuré sa souveraineté sur les dieux du ciel et de la terre. 100 AnSar le magnifia encore, en nommant son nom Asallubi : « A l’énoncé de son nom, témoignons-lui le respect ! »
« Que les dieux prêtent attention à ses paroles, • 6-25 que son ordre soit prééminent, en haut et en bas, qu’il soit exalté, le Fils, notre sauveur, 105 que sa suzeraineté soit prééminente, qu’il n’ait pas d’égal. »
« Qu’il exerce le pastorat des Têtes Noires, ses créatures, • 6-26 à l’avenir, pour qu’on n’oublie jamais, qu’ils racontent ses hauts faits ! Qu’il fixe pour ses pères de grandes offrandes, qu’il exerce leur entretien, qu’il organise leurs sanctuaires ! » 110
« Qu’il fasse humer la fumigation, qu’eux se réjouissent de leur entretien, • 6-27 que soit fait sur terre l’image de ce qu’il s ’est fait au ciel. Qu’il apprenne aux Têtes Noires à le révérer, que les peuples se souviennent, que leur dieu soit invoqué ! »
Qu’à son ordre, ils élèvent son IStar, 115 • 6-28 Que soient apportées les offrandes, à leur dieu et à leur IStar. Que rien ne soit oublié, qu’ils entretiennent leur dieu, que ceux-ci se manifestent dans leur pays, qu’ils se bâtissent leurs sanctuaires.

ENÜMA ELIS
que dans l’avenir des peuples, dans la suite des jours, elle s’écarte sans qu’on puisse la retenir, qu’elle soit au loin pour toujours ! »
Puisqu’il avait créé les lieux et façonné les enfers, 135 le père Enlil le nomma de son nom : Enkurkur. (51)
Les Igigi avaient ainsi nommé tous ses noms. Ea l’entendit et son coeur éclata de joie : « Celui dont ses pères ont glorifié le nom, que Lui soit comme moi Ea, que ce soit aussi son nom ! (52) 140 Qu’il exerce la souveraineté sur la totalité de mes rites, que tous mes commandements, ce soit lui qui les gère ! »
Par les Cinquante Noms, les grands dieux ont nommé ses Cinquante Noms, ils ont rendu son être suprême : Qu’ils soient retenus, que le Premier les commente, 145 que le sage et le savant les méditent ensemble.
Que le père les répète et les fasse apprendre à son fils, que cela ouvre l’intelligence du pasteur et du berger, afin qu'il ne soit pas négligent enver l’Enlil des dieux, Marduk : que son pays soit abondant et lui, en bonne santé. 150
Sa parole est stable, son ordre ne peut être modifié, aucun dieu ne pourrait annuler ce qui vient de sa bouche. Quand il a le regard mauvais, il ne détourne pas la nuque, lorsqu’il se met en colère, aucun dieu ne peut lui faire face.
Son coeur est insondable, vaste son être, 155 le coupable et le criminel marchent devant lui. La révélation, le Premier l’a dite devant lui, il l’a écrite, la mettant ainsi à la disposition des générations futures.
[Ce sont les hauts faits] de Marduk, qui a créé les dieux Igigi, que l’on [...], qu’on prononce son nom, 160 que l’on lise le chant de Marduk qui a enchaîné Tiamat et s’est emparé de la royauté.
