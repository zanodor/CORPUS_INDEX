These documents are alphabetized as Akkadian-English. I needed an English-Akkadian document, and ñ finding nothing readily availableódecided to convert the Akkadian-English files to an abbreviated English-Akkadian version. The oi.chicago.edu volumes are amazingly detailed, showing the specific usages and texts where each word in the dictionary is used. The individual volumes range in size from about 200 pages to 500 pages, and as one will see in reviewing this complex oi.chicago work, the work is massive (Akk. ìe quî). My need to prepare the English-Akkadian version has to do with my work in preparation of the ìEtruscan Phrases Indo-European Table.î This table began as a table that showed Indo-European leximes/cognates that coincided with the 2,500 words vocabulary I developed from examination and translation of over 600 Etruscan texts. Later, in preparation of this table it became apparent that there was a greater mission involved with the table, of reconciling Indo-European languages with other language groups, first Baltic, Uralic and Kartvelian, then finding a need to expand the listing of concording leximes to Hurrian/Urartian and subsequently Akkadian. I refer those who are interested to begin with our Indo-European Table, Part 1, available at academia.edu or at maravot.com Etruscan Phrases, which is at: http://www.maravot.com/Indo-European_Table.html. Professional linguists and novices will no doubt enjoy seeing common words still used today that may have been passed down through the Indo-European languages to English. One of many words involved an old hobby I had, as I was an impressionist oil painter in Paris in the 80ís and applied gesso first to my canvass before applying the oil paints. Recently, I discovered that the Akkadian word for plaster, whitewash, gypsum is: îga u.î A note on the special letters used by oi.chicago.edu. = îsh,î = a hard ìt,î and =ìch.î Other more common characters are: ö, , ‚, , Í, , , Ó, ,  ̊. This, of course, is a work in progress, and, seeing the vocabulary develop and its implications, I believed others would like to use this English-Akkadian version. Once again, it was developed by me as a tool to reconcile--and inform--to the words in my Indo-European Table. As a side note, in this strange, unsettled age, involving the plight of Middle-Eastern nations and immigrants fleeing the horrors of merciless, (Akk. ìgam luî), unrestrained governments, and even persecuted by the government that hosts the Statue of Liberty, that among the first words in our American English-Akkadian Dictionary is ìabandoned child.î It may be that Sargon, the founder of the Assyrian/Akkadian Empire (2334 to 2279 BC), who was apparently born an illegitimate son and who was discovered abandoned adrift in a basket (like Moses) on the Euphrates River. He is known for ìcreating the first multi-national empire in historyî [<ancient.eu]. Today, the idea of certain governments is to purge those that do not conform to their likeness: an old, criminal idea tried by Hitler (who abhorred multi-nationals and enjoyed destroying them and their families.) We thank the Assyrian government for making these Assyrian files available and encourage those who are curious about Iraq and Syria and their old foundations to visit www.aina.org.
