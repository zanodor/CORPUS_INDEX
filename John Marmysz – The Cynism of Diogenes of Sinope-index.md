That’s Not Funny: The Humor of Diogenes
Abstract: This article offers an analysis of the role humor plays in the philosophy of Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412–c. 323 BC). It argues that the Cynicism authored by Diogenes is a philosophy premised on a number of doctrines, and that among these doctrines humor holds the central place. The Cynical humor of Diogenes is characterized as more than just a feature of his personality or a method through which he communicates his real message, but as the actual state of mind that he intends to impart to his students.

1 Introduction
The term “cynic,” as it is commonly used today, tends to be associated with negative evaluations. To call someone cynical is to suggest that person sees the worst in others, distrusts the motivations of others, and has a generally dark and critical perspective on the world and people in it. Today, a cynic is rarely thought of as an affirmative, happy or joyful individual; and if the cynical attitude is associated at all with humor, it is with a cruel, spiteful and mean-spirited sort of humor that holds others in contempt. There are two separate yet related, dimensions to the evaluative characteristics of contemporary cynicism. First, and most obviously, there is the negative evaluation deployed by the one accused of being a cynic. When regarding others, the cynic is thought not to be satisfied with just describing human actions. Rather, the cynic also evaluates those actions and judges them as emerging from hidden, self-serving but unacknowledged motivations. So it is that a cynic casts the worst light on human behavior, claiming that no one, no matter what appears to be the case, is ever altruistic or self-sacrificing. Mother Teresa, according to the cynic, is really after fame. The Dalai Lama is really motivated by egoism. Martin Luther King, Jr. was really concerned with his own power. The best people, the cynic tells us, are inspired to act by all of the same ugly, selfish desires as the worst; and, in the end, the cynic even judges the “best” to be more dishonest than the “worst” insofar as they fail to acknowledge their own true motivations.

But there is a second dimension of evaluation that operates in the contemporary understanding of cynicism. Apart from the person to whom the word is applied, there is also an evaluation exercised by one who applies the word to another person. Calling someone a cynic suggests a criticism of that person’s perspective as being unnecessarily or implausibly negative. For instance, if I say that it is cynical for one to claim that Mother Teresa is really only after fame, I am suggesting that the cynic who has exercised this negative evaluation of Mother Teresa has done something uncalled for and unjustified. Such a person has brought an unnecessarily dark and uncharitable view to bear on their target. In calling this view cynical I am providing a negative evaluation of the cynic’s own negative evaluation. I am saying that such a perspective is inaccurate and reveals more about the cynic him or herself than it does about the object of the cynic’s criticism. These two levels of negative evaluation color the way that we think of cynicism today, obscuring the historical fact that the origins of the cynical perspective are actually found in a philosophy having more to do with the affirmation of life than with dismissive and negative criticism of others.1 This philosophy began with the ancient Greek figure Diogenes of Sinope (c.412–c.323 BC), a man who was exiled from his homeland and who spent the rest of his days in Athens and Corinth, living in a large, ceramic jar while using humor to educate others concerning the nature of a good life. Inspired by Socrates, but departing from his method, Diogenes’s use of humor remains an innovation that, while frequently highlighted and noted by scholars,2 has rarely been explored systematically and in depth. I shall attempt to address this lacuna by offering a methodical analysis of the role humor plays in the philosophy of Diogenes. I shall argue that the Cynicism authored by Diogenes is a philosophy premised on a number of doctrines—none of which are essentially negative in character—and that among these doctrines humor holds the central place. The Cynical humor of Diogenes, I shall claim, is more than just a feature of his personality or a method
 It is for this reason that Peter Sloterdijk makes a distinction between “cynicism,” referring to the popular, contemporary, negative use of the term, and “kynicism,” referring to the ancient Greek philosophy. See Sloterdijk 1987. William Desmond notes that German writers generally make a distinction between “ancient Kynismus” and “modern Zynismus,” a distinction that he suggests can be conveyed in English by referring to ancient Cynics (with a capital “C”) and modern cynics (with a lowercase “c”). In this article I follow Desmond’s advice. See Desmond 2008, 4.  For instance: Amir 2014, 206; Branham 1996, 81– 104; Desmond 2008, 105; Dudley 1974, x; Flachbartova 2018, 83 – 87; Halliwell 2008, 375 – 81; Bosman 2006; Sloterdijk 1987, 101– 06.

through which he communicates his real message. It is, in fact, the state of mind that he intends to impart to his students.
2 Diogenes of Sinope
There is some scholarly disagreement about who deserves credit for initiating the Cynical movement in ancient Greece. Ancient Cynics expressed great admiration for the mythic hero Heracles, the Presocratic thinker Heraclitus, and the philosopher Socrates. Consequently, it is sometimes claimed that the roots of Cynicism are to be found in all of these figures; although as a unique form of life it is more common for credit to go either to Antisthenes or Diogenes.3 Regardless of who the “real” author of ancient Greek Cynicism is, it is clear that according to most scholars, it is Diogenes who most purely embodies the Cynical spirit and who has acted as the most powerful inspiration for those committed to the movement. Tradition holds that Diogenes was exiled from his home of Sinope on the charge of adulterating, falsifying or defacing the coinage (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI.20); an undertaking that has served as a central Cynic mission ever since. Taken literally, the indictment against Diogenes referred to an act of vandalism by which he compromised the integrity of the state’s monetary system; literally striking the faces off of state issued coins. However, after his exile, Diogenes visited the Oracle at Delphi and with her advice seems to have come to understand his life’s mission as one in which he was destined metaphorically to continue defacing the “coinage” of social custom as a way of demonstrating the hollowness and artificiality of society’s conventions (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI.20). Like state issued coins, social customs, norms and habits are easily reified and mistakenly treated as if they possess objective and intrinsic value. Just as it is easy to fetishize money, it is also easy to fetishize social customs, treating them as if they are fixed, unchanging and necessary. But this is a mistake that has at least two undesirable consequences. First, it obscures the distinction between nature and convention, confusing us about the general difference between that which is created by humans and that which is not. Second, confusion between the natural and the artificial further confuses us about our own particular, human nature, dooming us to self-alienation, unhappiness
 Wallace Matson, for instance, credits Antisthenes as the founder of Cynicism. See Matson 1987, 152. Donald D. Dudley, on the other hand, asserts “Cynicism cannot be shown to antedate Diogenes of Sinope” and that “Antisthenes had no direct contact with the Cynics” (Dudley 1974, xi).

and existential discontent. If we cannot accurately distinguish between what society expects us to be and who we really are, then we easily fall prey to neglecting our true selves by becoming cogs in the social mechanism. We lose the potential to develop ourselves as self-directed and spiritually fulfilled human beings. Diogenes’s mission of defacing the coinage of social convention was, thus, directed toward revealing the artificiality of social customs and rituals precisely in order to reemphasize the true, underlying nature of human existence. It is humans who are responsible for formulating rules and norms and it is within our power to defy those rules and norms if we find that they distort, pervert or interfere with the expression of our real, inner human nature. Diogenes carried out his mission in a unique way. While philosophers before and after Diogenes have always attempted to live by their beliefs, their concern normally has been first to articulate their philosophical convictions in language according to a logical, rational method. Their ways of life, then, followed from, and were patterned according to, rational arguments formulated prior to acting in the world. As arguments evolved or changed, so too did their ways of behaving. According to traditional philosophers, right action follows from reason and reflection. Thinking comes first, then life. Diogenes, on the other hand, reversed this sequence, privileging action over logical, rational argumentation. Living a good life was indeed centrally important to him, but he seems to have held that reflection on life should come after—not before—life is actually lived. If you act first according to your bodily nature, you will then discover what is true and good. The problem with members of mainstream society is that they allow themselves to be corrupted by the artificial and unnatural influences of social customs and norms. They worry and fret over how others will view their behaviors, and thus find themselves diverted from the commands of their own bodily needs and drives. Diogenes’s advice is to let go of the worries and anxieties that normally condition our ways of life and just live. Once you start acting according to nature, then you can reflect upon and articulate who you really are.4 Diogenes’s goal, then, was similar to that of Socrates, who also advocated self-understanding and devotion to one’s inner self instead of devotion to the artificial commands of society. In fact, Plato is purported to have called Diogenes “Socrates gone mad” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI.53), suggesting that he took Socrates’s message to an extreme. Nonetheless, Diogenes’s own philosophical method is a departure from the Socratic Method. Whereas Socrates eagerly engaged with others in rational, logical and open discourse, Diogenes was most prone to—and most vividly remembered for—engaging others through his con

crete, bodily actions. While he did, on occasion, argue, debate, and write (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI.74, 80), in general Diogenes was concerned with, as Pierre Hadot claims, reducing philosophical discourse to a bare minimum (Hadot 2002, 109). For instance, in response to someone’s argument purporting to prove that he had horns, Diogenes simply touched his own forehead (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 39). In response to an argument claiming that motion is impossible, he merely “got up and walked around” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 39). As a reply to Plato’s argument establishing “Man as an animal, biped and featherless,” Diogenes delivered a plucked fowl to the Academy’s lecture hall (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 40). Once, when the rhetorician Anaximenes was lecturing, Diogenes disrupted him by “producing some salt fish” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 57). As these cases illustrate, instead of talking and arguing about philosophical issues, Diogenes was more prone to use his body, instead of words, as his philosophical instrument, anticipating that his actions would provide lessons for others to learn from (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 70). And Diogenes’s actions remain legendary. Upon his arrival in Athens, he found that he could not afford housing, so he turned over a large ceramic jar and made it his home (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 23). By living in a jar, Diogenes demonstrated that expensive housing is an extravagance one can do without. By nature, humans seek shelter. However, this natural inclination has been distorted by society to the extent that humans think they need not just shelter, but luxury. Diogenes’s lived example of taking cover in a large jar illustrates that a good life can be made in the simplest of ways. One need not become entangled in all of the unpleasant and unwanted complications that come along with renting or buying an expensive house just for the purpose of being protected from the elements. A discarded jar will do just as well. During their preparations for the war, while the Athenian citizenry ran about frantically getting their defenses ready, Diogenes instead frantically rolled his ceramic jar up and down a hill. When asked why he was doing so, he replied that since everyone around him was so busy, he wanted to keep busy as well! (Lucian 1959, §3). This seemingly absurd action, upon reflection, actually demonstrates an important philosophical truth. Humans, by nature, have the need to remain active. But rolling a jar up and down a hill can just as effectively satisfy this need as can preparations for war. Indeed, it may even be the case that war is the more absurd of the two activities. After all, if everyone contented themselves with jar rolling rather than with warfare, we would live in a much more peaceful place. Furthermore, the activity of repeatedly pushing a ceramic jar up and down a hill illustrates the cyclical nature of all human needs. Humans complicate this cyclical pattern by trying to introduce novelty into life. So instead of just being satisfied with the natural cycles of eating, sleeping and procreating, we create

artificial needs, such as warfare, wealth, power and fame, all of which distract us from the absurdly recurrent nature of our existence. Like Albert Camus’s Sisyphus, Diogenes demonstrates through his actions that contentment in life does not rest on the pursuit of any particular goal. It rests only on the pursuit of some sort of goal. But some goals are less destructive and damaging than others. So why not choose the least harmful over the more harmful pastimes? Instead of killing and dying in an awful war, why not become a master of jar rolling? Upon seeing a young slave boy drinking water with just his cupped hands, Diogenes threw away his own drinking cup, realizing that it was an unnecessary extravagance he could do without (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 37). Again, his lived actions demonstrated that nature has given us all that we need to survive and prosper. It is only the influence of social convention that deludes us into thinking that instruments like drinking cups are necessary living accessories. We can do perfectly well with just the two hands at the ends of our arms. Diogenes scandalized Athenians by masturbating in public. When outraged onlookers criticized him for his indecency, Diogenes offered a simple defense. He told them that if a hungry man could alleviate hunger simply by rubbing his belly, they would consider him a fool if he refrained from doing so (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 46, 69). His point is clear. Sexual urges are just as natural as hunger pangs. But if sexual urges are as natural as hunger pangs, then it would be absurd to advocate the solitary alleviation of hunger while objecting to the solitary alleviation of sexual desire. It is only social convention and custom that encourage us to regard sex as indecent. Nature makes no such evaluation. Nor does nature abhor defecation or urination (things that Diogenes also reportedly did in public view). These are all natural functions that everyone engages in and that we should not be ashamed of. After all, if you observe animals you will see that they are perfectly happy publicly engaging in all of these sorts of behaviors. It is only human convention that commands us to be ashamed of our most basic needs. Better then to live like dogs! Indeed, the word “cynic” derives from the Greek word “kynikos,” meaning “dog-like.” For Diogenes and his students, living the life of a dog was more natural, and thus better, than living the life of a repressed, anxious and self-alienated citizen. Diogenes tried to demonstrate how self-alienated the Athenians were by running around the Agora in broad daylight with a lantern, yelling that he was in search of an honest “human being” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 41). In full sunlight, assisted by a lantern, Diogenes was showing the citizenry that he was unable to identify one happy, fulfilled and honest person in this city. This is how bad the situation was for those who populated the most civilized place in Greece. This is what all of their culture and sophistication had brought them: existential desolation. This is why Diogenes himself embraced no state as his unique home.

Instead of a citizen of any particular nation, Diogenes declared that he was a “cosmopolitan”: a citizen of the world (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 63). Governments, cities, countries, nations: all of these are artificial constructs. In demanding our allegiance, these entities also demand that we turn away from our deeper, shared, collective nature as fellow human beings. If we pay attention to this inner nature, we will discover what we all share in common. If instead we listen to the outer call of convention, we will become distracted and deluded by artificial distinctions that only create hostility and division among people. The lived, anti-establishment message of Diogenes repelled many, but it also resonated deeply with others. It may be surprising that one of Diogenes’s greatest admirers was Alexander the Great, the king of the Macedonian Empire. One might think that an individual such as Alexander—who was a student of Aristotle, a military general and a state leader—would be hostile to such a nonconformist philosophy. However, it is also the case that those most firmly entangled in the grips of society’s obligations are also the ones best positioned to understand how tiresome and tedious the demands of public life can be. In living the life of a king, Alexander was so sensitized to how much of his inner self needed to be sacrificed that at the end of his life he claimed that if he had not been born Alexander, he would have liked to have been born Diogenes (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 32). The feeling, however, was not mutual, as is evident in the story of Alexander’s encounter with Diogenes. Upon his arrival in Corinth, Alexander’s greatest wish was to meet with the philosopher, who he found reclining in the sun. As Alexander stood over the sunbathing Diogenes, he introduced himself, explaining that because of his admiration he was willing to grant the philosopher any wish he might have. Diogenes opened his eyes and requested one thing: for Alexander to step out of his sunlight! (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 38) His message is clear. The king of the Macedonian Empire, the most powerful military leader in the world had nothing that Diogenes wanted or needed. In fact, he was only blocking the one thing it was that Diogenes really did desire at that moment; something that nature itself provided: sunlight! How Diogenes died is a matter of mystery, with different stories being told by those who admired him and by those who detested him. His enemies claim that he died as a result of eating raw meat or raw octopus, or that he was attacked by dogs, suggesting that his life choices were stupid and unsafe. Those who admired Diogenes claim that he actually died by holding his breath, suggesting that it was through discipline and strength of will that he was able to die on his own terms while living by his own principles, much like Socrates before him (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 76). Whatever the case, Diogenes reportedly told his friends that upon his death he did not want to be buried. Rather, he wanted his body left out in the open to be fed upon by wild animals (Diogenes

Laertius 1970, VI. 79). Let nature take its course, and even in death, all will be fine. Diogenes the dog is rumored to have authored a number of written worksamong them poems and tragedies—only fragments of which survive (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 80 – 81). Consequently, the greatest part of what we know of him comes instead from stories and myths, like those related above, which have been handed down by others. These myths and stories, whether literally true or not, have served to shape the later reception and understanding of Diogenes. They comprise the primary evidence with which scholars have attempted to reconstruct his Cynical philosophy. Unlike with Socrates, Diogenes’s students did not focus on recording his words in dialogues, nor did they attribute any complicated or abstract logical arguments to him. It is primarily the actions of Diogenes that have been memorialized. Just as the dialogues of Plato or of Xenophon suggest what Socrates’s students found important about their teacher, so too the humorous, cheeky and irreverent accounts left to us by Diogenes’s students indicate what it was about him that his followers found unique and important. Reading these stories, it was not so much what Diogenes argued that appears to have concerned them. What was important, rather, was how he acted and behaved. The core element that is apparent in the stories about Diogenes is his keen and biting sense of ironic wit; a wit that transformed what might otherwise appear to be simple rudeness, indecency and vulgarity into comedic social commentary.
3 Humor as a Cynical Method
It has often been noted by scholars that Diogenes used wit and humor to convey his cynical message. However, the details of how his humor operated have rarely been the focus of extended attention. One notable exception is the article by R. Bracht Branham titled “Defacing the Currency: Diogenes’ Rhetoric and the Invention of Cynicism” (1996). Though Branham’s article is focused on the broader topic of Diogenes’s general rhetorical methods, he does devote ample space to argue that humor plays the most fundamental role in Diogenes’s philosophical performances. Branham’s argument draws on the ideas of Mary Douglas, who proposes a theory of humor that emphasizes the liberating and disruptive nature of jokes, claiming that they work against the moralistic and conservative forces of cultural rituals (Douglas [1968] 1988, 90 – 144). Branham suggests that the humor of Diogenes serves the purpose of disrupting social convention and operates by revealing the unstated assumptions held by those who are shocked by his irreverent behavior. When Diogenes acts out in public, he demonstrates
104 John Marmysz



through his bodily actions that social norms are not necessary, that the assumptions governing adherence to social customs are artificial, and that there are alternatives to cultural conformity; namely the commands of nature and of the body. It is the body that is “the visible expression of his exemption from social control, of his immunity to doxa or public opinion” (Branham 1996, 100). Through his bodily actions, Diogenes violates polite expectations, in the process highlighting the unspoken rules of civilized behavior that have been taken for granted by his audience. The ironic contrast between popular expectation and Diogenes’s bodily actions is the mechanism of Cynical humor, according to Branham. It is the fundamental method of his philosophy. Branham’s account emphasizes the structural component of incongruity at the heart of Diogenes’s use of humor. Generally speaking, incongruity theories claim that humorous effect is produced by way of the juxtaposition of conflicting, contradictory or otherwise incongruous ideas, images, actions or other phenomena. It is the contrast between these inharmonious elements that triggers amusement in audiences, making them laugh, or at least producing an inner feeling of delight.5 In the case of Diogenes’s philosophical performances, the incongruous elements brought into contrast with one another are Diogenes’s own actions and the taken for granted modes of behavior that are part of the background expectations of polite citizens. So, for instance, by this account when Diogenes repeatedly rolls his ceramic jar up and down a hill, this action is compared to the frantic actions of the Athenians who are preparing for war, and the result is a humorous effect. To the mechanism of incongruity, Branham adds another element that helps to explain the deeper, philosophical import of Diogenes’s humor. Humor, he claims, “has an enthymematic character” (Branham 1996, 99). Like an incomplete argument, examples of humor require an audience to fill in the missing pieces, to bridge “a logical gap” (Branham 1996, 99), revealing a set of underlying assumptions and counter assumptions about reality. So, in addition to incongruity, Branham suggests that it is the logical resolution of apparent incongruities that leads to the production of humor. For instance, when Diogenes incongruously compares sexual desire to hunger pains, he invites his audience to fill in the blanks concerning the relief of both kinds of urges:
(1) (Stated premise) If nature had made it possible to relieve hunger by rubbing one’s stomach, then it would be foolish not to do so.
 For incongruity theories of humor, Carroll 2014, 16 – 37; Critchley 2002, 3; Marmysz 2003, 123 – 54; Marmysz, (2015) 2016, 14– 15; Morreall 1983, 15 – 19; Morreall 2009, 9 – 15.
That’s Not Funny: The Humor of Diogenes 105



(2) (Unstated premise) Sexual desire is a natural urge, like hunger. (3) (Conclusion, carried out by Diogenes as an action) Nature has made it possible to relieve sexual desire by rubbing the appropriate body parts, and it would be foolish not to do so.
In this case, the enthymematic argument proceeds backwards. First, Diogenes performs an action (masturbation) that serves as the ostensive conclusion to his argument. This action strikes audiences as incongruous when compared to their own background assumptions about polite, civilized, public behavior. When confronted with this incongruity, Diogenes articulates a supporting premise (1), which then in turn provokes audiences to fill in the logical gap with another unstated premise (2). In this particular case, the unstated premise is one that most people would probably accept as true, and so Diogenes makes his point. Objections to his masturbatory behavior turn out to be the result of irrational adherence to convention and are shown to be inconsistent with other beliefs also held to be true by observers. It is through this method, according to Branham, that Diogenes delivers his philosophical message. By means of this humorous process, the Cynic’s real message is delivered and audiences come to understand his point.6 Branham’s account highlights at least three things about the humor of Diogenes. First, he holds that humor is a rhetorical method utilized by Diogenes in order to deliver his real philosophical message. Second, this method operates by means of an incongruity between the taken for granted cultural assumptions of audiences and the performed actions of Diogenes himself. Audiences are encouraged to bridge this incongruous gap, in the process making explicit their own assumptions about appropriate behavior. Finally, in so doing, Branham’s account highlights (following Douglas) how Diogenes’s humorous method disrupts social convention, encouraging people to liberate themselves from the unnatural and oppressive constraints of mainstream norms. It is this third element that Branham claims is the central Cynical message. I agree with much of Branham’s account. I think he is correct in highlighting the role that incongruity plays in Diogenes’s humor as well as the enthymematic structure of his performances. I also agree that at least part of Diogenes’s philosophical goal was to provoke reflection on the artificial nature of social customs. However, I don’t think Branham goes far enough to emphasize the fundamental importance of humor to Diogenes’s actual philosophical message. In
 Sloterdijk also observes that Diogenes’s humor operates by discovering “the animal body in the human and its gestures as arguments” (Sloterdijk 1987, 103).
106 John Marmysz



what follows I shall argue that humor is not, as Branham characterizes it, simply a method used by Diogenes in order to convey his true philosophical message, but is itself a central point—part of the actual content—of his Cynical philosophy.
4 Threatening versus Unthreatening Incongruities
For many audiences, Diogenes’s performances were not (and still today are not) thought to be funny. Instead, many people in his time and our own have found his behavior to be rude, disgusting, coarse and vulgar. Even after carrying out the required logical work of filling in the missing premises in his implied arguments, many people (maybe most?) continue to react with outrage rather than amusement; disgust rather than laughter. What this demonstrates is that there is nothing in Diogenes’s method that necessitates a humorous response from observers. It is possible fully to understand the structure of his implied arguments and yet still remain hostile to his message. But if you don’t get the joke, if you react to Diogenes’s antics by saying “That’s not funny!” have you really understood him? I shall claim that you have not. While I agree with Branham that Diogenes’s method of philosophizing relied on an enthymematic argument structure in which his bodily actions and utterances gestured toward unstated premises and conclusions in incomplete lines of reasoning, I disagree that it is the completion of these arguments that alone explains the humor of Diogenes. Diogenes was making more than just a logical point with his outrageous performances and proclamations. His logic was merely a tool used in order to deliver far more important aesthetic and ethical teachings. Aesthetically, in highlighting the incongruities between convention and nature, Diogenes was seeking to transform his audiences’ way of perceiving those incongruities by showing how a humorous reaction to nonconformity is possible. He was not simply demonstrating that there is an incongruity between nature and convention. Rather, his philosophical goal was to demonstrate that such incongruities need not be interpreted through the lens of threat, but could instead be judged as pleasantly amusing. This, in turn, opened up the possibility of an ethical transformation for the student who could then harness this insight for the purposes of life.7
 Stephen Halliwell also suggests that there are two levels of intent at work in the “mockery” of Diogenes: one “antinomian,” which rejects social convention, and the other ethical, which offers a corrective to people’s behavior (Halliwell 2008, 376).
That’s Not Funny: The Humor of Diogenes 107



The revelation of socially disruptive incongruities is not in itself sufficient to provoke amusement. On the contrary, more often than not such exposure likely provokes negative resistance and offence, as is evidenced by the fact that Diogenes was condemned as a “dog” by Plato, and that he continued to be belittled by thinkers from Aristotle to Oswald Spengler. Often, when people’s unstated assumptions about the world are revealed, they don’t find anything funny about it at all. Rather, they feel threatened or embarrassed. This is especially the case when those unstated assumptions are in conflict with other deeply cherished ideas within a person’s belief system. Rather than finding such inconsistencies amusing, people often either ignore, suppress or offer a justification for the conflict. If they ignore the conflict, then their belief system remains unchanged and internally inconsistent. If they suppress the conflict, then their belief system again remains unchanged while they also lapse into neurotic denial.8 If they offer a justification for the conflict, then their belief system still remains unchanged, but they supply some sort of overarching defense for how it is that the apparently conflicting beliefs that they consciously endorse can legitimately coexist. In all of these responses, the revelation of inconsistency provokes a mental response focused on the preservation of systems of belief perceived to be under attack. Both in ancient and in modern times, those offended by Diogenes’s actions have often responded in these ways. Because they feel threatened, they adopt a defensive, angry and hostile attitude, encouraging the preservation of their assumptions about the legitimacy of conventional beliefs. For these individuals, Diogenes is an irritant, but not a teacher. Others, however, do not find Diogenes threatening, and they are the ones open to what he has to teach. If one is not emphatically committed to preserving pre-existing, conventional beliefs about the world, then it becomes possible to question those beliefs and to see them from an alternative, critical perspective. When incongruities and inconsistencies are revealed within the belief systems of those possessing openness to alternative viewpoints, there is no scramble to defend one set of ideas over another. Instead, the revelation of incongruity is greeted with the sort of interest that one has for a benign oddity demanding attention but not requiring instant resolution. For a person who is unthreatened by incongruities, instead of mounting a campaign of instant resolution, there is a willingness to linger with and contemplate the incongruous phenomena for their own sake, potentially finding aesthetic pleasure (rather than moral threat) in the process.
 This leads to the growth of what Sloderjik diagnoses as the contemporary, non-humorous form of cynicism.
108 John Marmysz



Incongruities, then, are not in themselves sufficient to provoke humor. Additionally, those incongruities must be regarded as unthreatening if they are to be found amusing; and the capacity to regard incongruities as unthreatening—and thus to find them amusing—requires the cultivation of patience, tolerance and sympathy in the face of that which is puzzling and unfamiliar. This capacity is called good humor. In what follows, I shall argue that it is this capacity that Diogenes intended to teach to his students.
5 Diogenes’s Humorous Teaching
Stephen Halliwell suggests that Diogenes may not have been interested in teaching others at all. He observes that Diogenes very often appears self-absorbed, acting as if he was “both performer and the prime audience for his own jests” (Halliwell 2008, 379). In this sense, Halliwell characterizes Diogenes as something of a “self-indulgent” and “insolent child” who “stands apart from the crowd” (Halliwell 2008, 379) and really does not care, one way or another, whether the audience gets his jokes. Diogenes’s humor and his mockery of convention often seem to be for his own benefit, not for others according to Halliwell. He acts like a “loner” who does not need anyone and does not care about teaching anything to other people. But if this is true, it raises a question: why, upon his exile from Sinope, did Diogenes gravitate to Athens rather than leaving civilization behind once and for all? His choice of destination seems strange for someone who needs no audience and desires no students. When he had the chance, why not abandon civilization and withdraw into self-sufficient bliss? It has already been established that Diogenes’s philosophy must be reconstructed by reference to his own lived, bodily actions, and one of the most obvious of his actions was that he did not abandon civilization altogether, but indeed sought it out. After his exile he settled in Athens—where he was loved by some people and made friends (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 43, 46)—claiming that it was this very experience that made him into a philosopher (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 49). Presumably, in being forced from his home and in moving to another city, he learned not to take culturally relative and fluctuating customs too seriously,9 but this does not imply that Diogenes did not care at all about people or the importance of social life. It seems just the opposite, given his choice to settle
 Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 73 suggests Diogenes’s cultural relativism: “And he saw no impropriety either in stealing anything from a temple or in eating the flesh of any animal; nor even anything impious in touching human flesh, this, he said, being clear from the custom of some foreign nations.”

among, and make friends with, the Athenians. In fact, one of the things Diogenes asserts is that nature itself recommends life in a community “as wide as the universe” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 72). His quarrel then, it seems, is not with community. Diogenes was a social creature like all human beings, and so his public performances, I think, were meant to accomplish something beyond mere self-gratification. His joking, comedic behavior was not anti-social. It was, I shall claim, a method by which he taught others how to laugh at unnecessary, oppressive social conventions. A person can hear a joke and not get it. Likewise, a person can view a comedic performance and not find it funny. What is required in order to laugh at a joke or a comedic performance is a sense of humor. Humor is the capacity that allows for the creation and the appreciation of jokes and comedy.10 Creators of jokes and comedy, like Diogenes, have a certain talent that enables them to engineer narratives and scenarios in which incongruous ideas, images, actions or other phenomena are brought into contrast with one another in ways that make it possible to experience absurd flashes of insight. In weaving incongruous elements together, a clever joke-maker ties together the familiar with the unfamiliar, drawing novel and unanticipated connections between otherwise dissimilar phenomena. In so doing, that which might otherwise be threatening in its unfamiliarity is drawn close to that which is familiar and unthreatening. A person who enjoys a joke or comedic performance is capable of retracing the contours of both the incongruities and connections inscribed into the joke or comic performance, following the path of its creator toward an ultimate terminus: the punch line. The pleasure announced in amused laughter is both the payoff and the proof that one has decoded and understood the intent and meaning of the jest. Both the creation and the enjoyment of jokes and comedy require creative work. On the side of the joke-maker there is the work involved in cleverly weaving together the familiar with the unfamiliar. On the side of the audience, there is the work involved in patiently and charitably trying to understand the meaning and the intentions of the joke-maker. In this way, the efforts involved in understanding a piece of humor are not unlike those involved in understanding an argument. When encountering the argument of another person, an interpreter must be willing to enter sympathetically into the intended line of reasoning. Without this sort of sympathy, there can be no meeting of minds and so no shared understanding. Of course, it is not unusual for people to approach arguments with hostility, in which case egos clash and communication fails. Argumentation ap

proached in this adversarial context subverts the cooperative atmosphere required for a true, charitable exchange of ideas. Likewise, if there is hostility on the part of audiences who are exposed to the witty creations of joke-makers or comedians, laughter and amusement will not result. Without sympathy and cooperation, they just won’t get it, and instead of amused pleasure, puzzlement, annoyance or outright anger will be the outcome. In an incomplete argument, it is up to the interpreter to supply missing assumptions in order to reconstruct the arguer’s intended logic. Branham suggests that the humor of Diogenes operates in terms of this enthymematic mechanism, and that his anti-establishment teachings are successfully received when audiences plug in the assumptions that have been left unstated. When they encounter the incongruity between their own cultural assumptions and the statements required to complete Diogenes’s implied arguments, the intended humor is revealed. And yet, as I have pointed out, while there are many people able successfully to carry out the logical steps that reveal the unstated assumptions in Diogenes’s implied arguments, not all of them truly get the joke. So what are they missing? A sense of humor. The humor of Diogenes requires an ambivalent state of mind capable of assessing things from more than one single, rigid point of view.11 In order to teach the way that he did, Diogenes had to be aware that: (1) certain rules of behavior are regarded as necessary according to social convention, and (2) many of those same rules are not really necessary according to nature. In order to construct his joking, comedic performances, Diogenes had to hold, at once, these two incongruous perspectives in his own mind, using his body to demonstrate the truth of (2) while revealing his audiences’ endorsement of (1). Diogenes’s humorous attitude relied on his ability to understand both points of views simultaneously, while his scandalized audiences could only understand the conventional point of view. In order to get his jokes, Diogenes’s students needed to resist the conventional reflex to take offence and do the difficult mental work required in order to execute a shift in perspective, which would then allow them to mirror the ambivalent state of mind of their teacher. This shift begins with a logical step in which the student fills in the blanks of Diogenes’s implied, enthymematic arguments, revealing that there is an incongruity between convention and nature. But the shift continues, going even further, when the student, instead of rushing to endorse either convention or nature, simply finds the juxtaposition of the two opposing demands amusing instead of threatening. By holding

both viewpoints in their minds at once, students exercise good humor. This is an aesthetic step, necessary in order to “get” the joke by encouraging students to linger in amusement with the incongruity to which their teacher has called attention. This highlights the fact that there are unthreatening, natural alternatives to conventional modes of behavior. The final, ethical step, seemingly recommended by Diogenes and other Cynics, was to then endorse the demands of nature over the unnatural demands of convention. Challenging social convention is not easy, but Diogenes teaches that, “Nothing in life... has any chance of succeeding without strenuous practice” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 71). According to Diogenes, we must train ourselves to live a good life, and that training is of two types: “mental and bodily” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 70). When Diogenes taught others, he emphasized his own bodily movements and actions, which were engineered in such a way as to defy and mock the rules of polite society; but they were not ends in themselves. The other aspect of his teaching was to encourage his students mentally to contemplate the significance of his bodily actions with the ultimate goal of replicating his own humorous ambivalence. It is through bodily actions that perceptions are formed, according to Diogenes (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 70), and so those who observed his physical nonconformity might come to understand that the grip of social convention is not ironclad, that it can be broken in the service of nature, and that this might “secure freedom of movement for virtuous deeds” (Diogenes Laertius 1970, VI. 70). By observing and thinking about why Diogenes did the things he did, his students might come to find that the incongruity between social convention and nature is not something threatening, but something that they can learn to find quite absurd and amusing. With this shift in perspective, Diogenes’s students exercise a sense of humor that furthermore encourages them to change their own ways of life. Those unable to find Diogenes funny are his failed students who, though they understand all of the steps in his arguments, still have not exercised the strenuous practice required to shift their mental perspective. On the other hand, his successful students are those who have done both the mental work to understand the steps in his implied arguments while also executing the even harder mental work of changing their conventional, socially conditioned perspectives in order to understand the nonconformist stance of Diogenes himself. In observing his comic, bodily performances, these students not only patiently linger with and contemplate the incongruity between their own conventional assumptions about polite behavior and Diogenes’s impolite actions, but they also execute a shift in their own way of appreciating these actions by learning to take up their teacher’s viewpoint rather than condemning him. The successful student of Diogenes—like the successful student of Plato or of Aristotle

—learns how to integrate the teacher’s perspective into his or her own way of thinking. The same act can provoke either laughter or hostility depending on the attitude of the audience. It is this attitude that makes the difference between whether an incongruity is greeted with amusement or with irritation. Diogenes tried to teach his students how to transform their own way of thinking into one that would allow the incongruities of the world to appear in a humorous, rather than a threatening, light. He did this with his concrete, bodily performances, through which he subverted and undermined many of the mainstream expectations of Athenian citizens. In this, it was his bodily performances, not his sense of humor, which comprised his method of teaching. His sense of humor was, rather, a central quality that he hoped to mentally cultivate in his students. Just as Plato’s and Aristotle’s methods consisted of lecturing, Diogenes’s methods consisted of acting out in public by rolling ceramic jars, urinating, defecating and masturbating. And just as students needed to approach the difficult lectures of Plato and Aristotle with an attitude of patience, openness and charity if they hoped to cultivate the intellectual qualities of reason and goodness that their teachers were trying to impart, so too the students of Diogenes needed to exercise good humor in order to grasp the intellectual nature of his wisdom. Those who laughed at Diogenes’s performances were not threatened by his attacks on their value systems, even though they were no doubt startled by his nonconformity. Their laughter and amusement were made possible by virtue of the fact that, instead of rushing to condemn Diogenes or to defend their own taken-for-granted expectations about polite behavior, they instead not only tolerated his eccentricities, but lingered in amused mental contemplation of the incongruities that Diogenes was highlighting. In patiently entertaining the abstract implications of Diogenes’s concrete actions, students shifted their everyday perspective to one that viewed his behavior through the amused lens of good humor rather than seriousness. It was this transformation of perspective that was at the core of the philosopher’s teaching. He wasn’t out simply to shock or to subvert expectations. His deeper, philosophical purpose was to change the way people perceive the incongruity between nature and convention so that they could cultivate a sense of humor, stop taking unnecessary conventions so seriously, and thus embrace their true nature.
6 Conclusion
Scholars have a wide variety of perspectives on the nature of ancient Greek Cynicism. Some claim that it has no real core set of beliefs, and thus that Cynicism is

more like a life-style than a philosophy (Matson 1987, 153). Others claim that while it is a philosophy with a core set of beliefs, those beliefs are nothing more than a “debased” version of the ideas of Socrates (Dudley 1974, ix). Some claim that Cynicism’s chief characteristic is an insistence on individual freedom (Sayre 1945, 113 – 18; Desmond 2008, 3). Still others claim that Cynicism is an original and full-blown philosophy resting on beliefs about the goodness of human nature, the evils of convention, the nobility of hard work (Desmond 2008), and/or the virtues of poverty (Desmond 2006). My own claim—focusing specifically on Diogenes—is that Cynicism is a philosophy whose central teaching is that the good life requires a sense of humor. Peter Sloterdijk’s claim that Diogenes was much like a Zen master is apt in this regard (Sloterdijk 1987, 157); except that instead of showing students the way to satori, Diogenes showed his students the way to the development of a humorous attitude. The Cynical humor of Diogenes is an attitude that regards the incongruity between nature and convention as something unthreatening, and thus amusing rather than menacing. The development of this attitude in himself is a concrete demonstration that it is possible for others as well, and he establishes this possibility by acting out in public and encouraging his students patiently to fill in the blanks of his implied arguments. But just as satori is more than a Zen koan, humor is more than just an argument. It is the very state of mind that Diogenes strove to cultivate in his students. It is part of the content—and not merely the form—of his teachings. When we use the phrase “cynical humor” these days, it carries negative connotations. We tend to think of this style of wittiness as clever but cruel. It is humor had at the expense of others, accompanied by the kind of laughter that is belittling and derisive. If this was the kind of humorous message that Diogenes had intended to teach, then we would rightly approach him with suspicion; the way that Plato and Aristotle did. Yet, however annoying Diogenes was to those with a stake in the conventional moral system, to those whose commitments were less rigid, his humorous message was liberating and life-enhancing.
