# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Sri Krishna of Vrishni kula, historical person, remembered on Indus Script.pdf

1
Sri Krishna of Vrishni kula, historical person, remembered on Indus Script which retains the memory of Krishna legends of 4th m. BCE
This monograph establishes the Indus Script as a continuum of Mahabharata events which constitute the sheet-anchor of Bharatiya Itihaasa and demonstrates the continuum of wealthproduction activities of artisans in ancient Indian mints and documented on sculptural epigraphs such as the inscription on Heliodorus pillar of Vidisha.
I submit that since the Mohenjo-daro tablets of a date later than the Mahabharata events, seem to evoke the Krishna legend of Nalakubera and Manigriva episode; hence, evoke the memory of Sri Krishna legends which are memories of Mahabharata period events which date to 4th m. BCE. The tablets date to ca. 2500 BCE, the mature period of Sarasvati Civilization and contain both pictorial motifs and sign sequences as text message which clearly refer to a period when the Indus Script had stabilised as a writing system in the expansive civilization area which spreads from Sinauli (Yamuna river basi) to Susa in Ancient Near East..
A book by Dr. ML Raja, 2019, Astronomical Evidence of the Date of Mahabharata War, Kochi, Kurukshetra Prakashan, dates the event to 3143 BCE based on the Nirayana method of calendrical trigonometrical computation, which takes Mesha 0-degree as fixed.
The wealth-accounting ledgers of Indus Script Corpora (from ca. 3300 BCE which is the archaeologically attested first potsherd with Indus Script hieroglyph) are continued in the Indus Script hieroglyphs of punch-marked coins of mints from Eurasia from Taxila to Karur; the recollected memories of MBh legends are also reflected on these hieroglyphs on coins.
The memories and legends of Sri Krishna are the reality and the metaphors are as close to truth as can be gleaned from ancient evidences of Indus Script inscriptions, ancient sculptures and inscriptions on pillars as on Heliodorus pillar of Vidisha, ancient Indian coins and ancient texts such as MBh and Harivamsa.
That Vrishnikula is a historical reality is proved by a remarkable coin with Indus Script hieroglyphs.

An identical ancient silver coin (perhaps produced from the same ancient mint) of Vrishni janapada ca. 10 CE with kharoṣṭhī, Brahmi inscriptions and Harappa Script hieroglyphs was sold in an auction in Ahmedabad (August 2016) for Rs. 27 lakhs. In fact, the treasure is priceless and defines the heritage of Bhāratam Janam, 'metalcaster folk' dating back to the 7th millennium of Vedic culture. It signifies a spoked wheel which is the centre-piece of Bharat's national flag. साांगड sāṅgaḍa 'joined animal', rebus: sangaDa ‘lathe’ sanghaṭṭana ‘bracelet’ rebus

Art historian and scholar of Bauddham studies, Huntington has identified the following characteristic, common features on the hypertext signified on these coins. I suggest that conclusions indicated by Huntington need to be revised in the context of life-activities of the artisans related to mint-metalwork signified on sculptural hypertexts and Punch-marked coin hypertexts.

Six-spoked hypertext emanating from dotted circle is: dhAu 'element, mineral ferrite' PLUS muhA 'furnace quantity, ingot' PLUS kANDa 'arrow' rebus: kaNDa 'implements;. Thus, the five PMC hypertexts signify mintwork with iron, molten cast copper, iron implements, ingots, furnace work.
On some sculptural friezes, the 'fish-fin' hypertext is ligatured to the tip of the spokes of the wheel emanating from the dotted circle. This signifies: ayo 'fish' rebus: ayas 'metal' aya 'iron'. PLUS khambhaṛā 'fish-fin' rebus: kammaTa 'mint, coiner, coinage'.

Hieroglyphs are: fish-fin pair; pine-cone; yupa: kandə ʻpine' rebus: kaṇḍa 'implements, fire-altar' khambhaṛā 'fish-fin' (Lahnda CDIAL 13640) Ta. kampaṭṭam, kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage'.

Ligature to 'mintwork' signifier is also shown on the wheel sculptural friezes of Amaravati -spokes are ligatured on their tips with 'fish-fins' joined together:ayo kammaTa 'iron mintwork' ayo 'fish' PLUS khambhaṛā 'fish-fin'.;
Amaravati sculpturel friezes: cakra with ligatures.
Elaborate orthography on sanchi stupa relates the spoked wheel to 'fish-fin' hypertext (mintwork) and also to tAmarasa 'lotus' rebus: tAmra 'copper'.

1. dotted circle 2. arrow (three) 3. twist (three) Some examples replace the 'twist' with 'buns-shaped ingots'. Thus, total six hypertexts emanate from dotted circle as spokes.
Four components of hypertext are read rebus in Meluhha:
1. Dotted circle is a Harappa Script hieroglyph and signifies a 'strand' of rope. dhāī ̃ 'strand' rebus: dhāu'soft red stone, element'(ferrite ore)
2. Twist is: मेढा mēḍhā A twist or tangle arising in thread or cord, a curl or snarl. (Marathi) Rebus: meḍ ‘iron’(Ho.)med 'copper' (Slavic languages) medha 'yajña, dhanam'. mũ h 'face' (Hindi) rebus: mũ he 'ingot' (Santali) mũh ã ̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end; mūhā mẽṛhẽt = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends;kolhe tehen mẽṛhẽt ko mūhā akata = the Kolhes have to-day produced pig iron (Santali).
3. Six spokes of wheel emanating from dotted circle: bhaṭa ‘six (hair-curls)’ Rebus: bhaṭa ‘furnace’.
4.. Hieroglyph: Or. kāṇḍa, kã ̄ ṛ ʻstalk, arrow ʼ(CDIAL 3023). Rebus: kāṇḍa,'implements'.
Connection to a rope imagery is seen here: 'strand' of rope. dhāī ̃ 'strand' rebus: dhāu 'soft red stone, element'(ferrite ore) PLUS मेढा mēḍhā A twist or tangle arising in thread or cord, a curl or snarl. (Marathi) Rebus: meḍ ‘iron’(Ho.) Thus, the signifiers are: meD dhAtu 'iron element' PLUS ayo khambhaṛā 'fish-fin' rebus:aya kammaTa 'iron mint'. Eight spokes relate to अष्टाशि yūpo bhavati 'eight-corneres yupa' of a Soma Samsthā yāga



7
Thus, together, the hypertext of dotted circle linked to six spokes as the चिालः caṣāla or cakra signifies a weapon with multiple prongs orthographed by sculptors and mintworkers who punched symbols on punch-marked coins. The arrows and twists thus signify: implements and furnaced ingots of dhatu'(ferrite) minerals'.

Ujjain, anonymous AE 3/8 karshapana,'Balarama & ass-demon' Weight: 3.86 gm., Diameter: 15x14 mm. Human figure on left holding stick and kamandalu standing towards a horse-like animal which faces him from right; palm tree on right; Ujjain symbol on top; a taurine above the animal and taurine and svastika at the bottom. Ujjain symbol with a svastika in each orb and taurines in the angles. Reference: Pieper 346 In a note to the SACG website Shailendra Bhandare suggested the scene on this coin representing the mythical story of 'Balarama killing the ass demon' and the depiction seems to reflect that story indeed quite well- even if the deity on this coin has no specific Vaishnavite attributes. We are told that there had been a large grove where there were palmyras bearing delicious fruits. But nobody dared to go there because the site was guarded by Dhenuka, a demon in the form of an ass. Finally Balarama, inseparable companion of Krishna, killed the demon by crashing him against one of the palm trees. In his contribution to 'Between the Empires' Bhandare discusses the story of 'Balarama killing the ass-demon' in the context of the coinage of Erikachha where the palm-tree and ass had been characteristic coin devices. Typologically this coin type may thus rather belong to Erikachha than to Ujjain.
"Shiva and Lakshmi other deities are also depicted on the coins of ancient Ujjain, such as Karttikeya, Shashthi, Vasudhara, Krishna, Brahma and others, according to the well-founded identifications of Devendra Handa." http://coinindia.com/galleries-ujjain2.html

Mitchiner identifies the obverse figure as an unidentified male deity, but Senior has correctly noted the plough, suggesting that the figure is Balarama (Senior calls him Bala-Krishna). The type follows the similar type issued by Maues (Sen 20).
"The Scythians or Sakas were originally a nomadic people from Central Asia who made their way into Bactria in the second century BCE. It is likely it is they who were responsible for the burning of AiKhanoum in what is now northern Afghanistan around 150 BCE. Maues was a king of this tribe who appears to have conquered territory in Kashmir and then acquired control of the area around Taxila in the Punjab. At this point, the Scythians were perhaps not as distinct from the Greeks as might be imagined, as considerable inter-marriage was probably taking place. There is a coin telling us that the so-called "Indo-Greek" king Artemidoros was the son of Maues. We also see this inter-mingling in the fact that most of Maues's coin types follow Greek prototypes. The date of Maues is still not entirely clear.The traditional dates are c. 90-60 BCE, but Artemidoros is dated to c. 85 BCE, which suggests Maues should be earlier."

Krishna legends date to 4th m.BCE, since the date of Mahabharata war is 4th m.BCE. Indus Script corpora dates from ca. 3300 BCE. Yamalarjuna episodes may be evoked on the narratives of two persons contesting with uprooted trees on three Mohenjo-daro tablets. The two persons are named in Harivamsa as Nalakubera and Manigriva.

Decipherment of ALL the Indus Script Corpora inscriptions has demonstrated that they are wealth-accounting ledgers of metalwork and lapidary work with gems and jewels (e.g. etched carnelian, agate, lapis lazuli etc.beads of precious stones). It is NOT unreasonable to interpret the narrative of two contestants holding uprooted trees as recollected memories associated with Sri Krishna of 4th m. BCE. The text Harivamsa describes them as Nalakubera and Manigriva with clear association with Indus Script Corpora as wealth-accounting ledgers and catalogues. The narrative on Mohenjo-daro tablets has been conclusively deciphered with a reinforcing narrative of a spy on a tree branch. Both narratives on the tablets convey the message of eraka 'moltencast,metal infusion' Hieroglyphs: heraka'spy' erga 'jungle clearance', rebus: eraka 'moltencast,metal infusion'. Harivamsa text metaphor is that both Nalakubera (red arsenic wealth) PLUS Manigriva (neck with gems, jewels on neck) emerge from trees. The tree is an Indus Script hieroglyph: kuTi 'tree' rebus: kuThi 'smelter'.In front of a tree, an adorant kneels with a pot offering, Sign 45. bhaTa 'adorant' rebus: bhaTa 'furnace', baTa 'iron' PLUS baTa 'rimless pot' rebus: baTa 'iron' (Semantic determinative).

Decipherment of three identical Harappa tablets m478 to m480 with uprooted trees narrative https://tinyurl.com/yh4n334v
"A steatite (soapstone) tablet unearthed from Mohenjo-daro, Larkana district, Sindh depicting a young boy uprooting two trees from which are emerging two human figures is an interesting archaeological find for fixing dates associated with Krishna. This image recalls the Yamalarjuna episode of Bhagavata and Harivamsa Purana. In this image, the young boy is undoubtedly Krishna, and the two human beings emerging from the trees are the two cursed gandharvas, identified as Nalakubara and Manigriva. Dr. E.J.H. Mackay, who did the excavation at Mohanjodaro, compares this image with the Yamalarjuna episode. Prof. V.S. Agrawal has also accepted this identification. Thus, it seems that the Indus valley people knew stories related to Krishna. This lone find may not establish Krishna as contemporary with Pre-Indus or Indus times, but, likewise, it cannot be ignored... In the 1st century BC, there seems to be evidence for a worship of five Vrishni heroes (Balarama, Krishna, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Samba) for an inscription has been found at Mora near Mathura, which apparently mentions a son of the great satrap Rajuvula, probably the satrap Sodasa, and an image of Vrishni, "probably Vasudeva, and of the "Five Warriors".

1. The Sanskrit word in its origin language Kṛṣṇa is primarily an adjective meaning "black" or "dark", sometimes it is also translated as "all attractive", according to members of the Hare Krishna movement. As a name of Vishnu, Krishna listed as the 57th Name in the Vishnu Sahasranama. Based on His Name, Krishna is often depicted in murtis as black or blue-skinned.



19
Krishna is also known by various other names, epithets and titles, which reflect His many associations and attributes. Among the most common Names are Mohan "enchanter", Govinda, "Finder of the cows", or Gopala, "Protector of the cows", which refer to Krishna's Childhood in Braj (in present day Uttar Pradesh). Some of the distinct names may be regionally important; for instance, Jagannatha, a popular Incarnation of Puri, Odisha in eastern India.
2. A steatite (soapstone) tablet unearthed from Mohenjo-daro, Larkana district, Sindh depicting a young boy uprooting two trees from which are emerging two human figures is an interesting archaeological find for fixing dates associated with Krishna. This image recalls the Yamalarjuna episode of Bhagavata and Harivamsa Purana. In this image, the young boy is undoubtedly Krishna, and the two human beings emerging from the trees are the two cursed gandharvas, identified as Nalakubara and Manigriva. Dr. E.J.H. Mackay, who did the excavation at



20
Mohanjodaro, compares this image with the Yamalarjuna episode. Prof. V.S. Agrawal has also accepted this identification. Thus, it seems that the Indus valley people knew stories related to Krishna. This lone find may not establish Krishna as contemporary with Pre-Indus or Indus times, but, likewise, it cannot be ignored.
3. The earliest text to explicitly provide detailed descriptions of Krishna as a personality is the epic Mahabharata which depicts Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu. Krishna is central to many of the main stories of the epic. The eighteen chapters of the sixth book (Bhishma Parva) of the epic that constitute the Bhagavad Gita contain the advice of Krishna to the warrior-hero Arjuna, on the battlefield. Krishna is already an adult in the epic, although there are allusions to his earlier exploits. The Harivamsa, a later appendix to this epic, contains the earliest detailed version of Krishna's childhood and youth.

4. The Rig Veda 1.22.164 sukta 31 mentions a herdsman "who never stumbles". Some Vaishnavite scholars, such as Bhaktivinoda Thakura, claim that this herdsman refers to Krishna. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar also attempted to show that "the very same Krishna" made an appearance, e.g. as the drapsa, krishna "black drop" of RV 8.96.13. Some authors have also likened prehistoric depictions of deities to Krishna.
5. Around 150 BC, Patanjali in his Mahabhashya quotes a verse: "May the might of Krishna accompanied by Samkarshana increase!" Other verses are mentioned. One verse speaks of "Janardhana with himself as fourth" (Krishna with three companions, the three possibly being Samkarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha). Another verse mentions musical instruments being played at meetings in the temples of Rama (Balarama) and Kesava (Krishna). Patanjali also describes dramatic and mimetic performances (Krishna-Kamsopacharam) representing the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva.
6. In the 1st century BC, there seems to be evidence for a worship of five Vrishni heroes (Balarama, Krishna, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Samba) for an inscription has been found at Mora near Mathura, which apparently mentions a son of the great satrap Rajuvula, probably the satrap Sodasa, and an image of Vrishni, "probably Vasudeva, and of the "Five Warriors". Brahmi inscription on the Mora stone slab, now in the Mathura Museum.
7. Krishna killed the demoness Putana, disguised as a wet nurse, and the tornado demon
Trinavarta both sent by Kansa for Krishna's life. He tamed the serpent Kāliyā, who previously poisoned the waters of Yamuna river, thus leading to the death of the cowherds. In Hindu art, Krishna is often depicted dancing on the multi-hooded Kāliyā.
8. Krishna lifted the Govardhana hill and taught Indra, the king of the devas, a lesson to protect native people of Brindavana from persecution by Indra and prevent the devastation of the pasture land of Govardhan. Indra had too much pride and was angry when Krishna advised the people of Brindavana to take care of their animals and their environment that provide them with all their necessities, instead of worshipping Indra annually by spending their resources. In the view of some, the spiritual movement started by Krishna had something in it which went against the orthodox forms of worship of the Vedic gods such as Indra. In Bhagavat Purana, Krishna says that the rain came from the nearby hill Govardhana, and advised that the people worshiped the hill instead of Indra. This made Indra furious, so he punished them by sending out a great storm. Krishna then lifted Govardhan and held it over the people like an umbrella.
9. Krishna married Rukmini, the Vidarbha princess, by abducting her, at her request, from her proposed wedding with Shishupala. He married eight queens—collectively called the Ashtabharya—including Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Nagnajiti, Bhadra and Lakshmana. Krishna subsequently married 16,000 or 16,100 maidens who were held captive by the demon Narakasura, to save their honour. Krishna killed the demon and released them all. According to social custom of the time, all of the captive women were degraded, and would be unable to marry, as they had been under the Narakasura's control. However Krishna married them to reinstate their status in the society. This symbolic wedding with 16,100 abandoned daughters was more of a mass women rehabilitation. In Vaishnava traditions, Krishna's wives are forms of the goddess Lakshmi— consort of Vishnu, or special souls who attained this qualification after many lifetimes of austerity, while his two queens, Rukmani and Satyabhama, are expansions of Lakshmi.



22
10. When Yudhisthira was assuming the title of emperor, he had invited all the great kings to the ceremony and while paying his respects to them, he started with Krishna because he considered Krishna to be the greatest of them all. While it was a unanimous feeling amongst most present at the ceremony that Krishna should get the first honours, his cousin Shishupala felt otherwise and started berating Krishna. Due to a vow given to Shishupal's mother, Krishna forgave a hundred verbal abuses by Shishupal, and upon the one hundred and first, he assumed his Virat (universal) form and killed Shishupal with his Chakra. The blind king Dhritarashtra also obtained divine vision during this time to be able to see this form of Krishna. Essentially, Shishupala and Dantavakra were both re-incarnations of Vishnu's gate-keepers Jaya and Vijaya, who were cursed to be born on Earth, to be delivered by the Vishnu back to Vaikuntha.
11. Krishna had eight princely wives, also known as Ashtabharya, or patrani (Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Nagnajiti, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Bhadra, Lakshmana) and the other 16,100 were rescued from Narakasura. They had been forcibly kept in his palace and after Krishna had killed Narakasura he rescued these 16,100 women and freed them. However, all of them returned to Krishna saying that because they had been kept by Narakasura none of their families would accept them and also nobody would marry any of them. So to stop them from being unprotected Krishna married them all on a single day, by taking 16,100 forms. The chief amongst them is sometimes called Rohini. He gave them shelter in his new palace and a respectful place in society. However he never had any relations with those 16,100 women, and many Hindu scriptures describe them as dancing around Krishna, singing songs of praise.
12. The first son of Queen Rukmini was Pradyumna, and also born of her were Charudeshna, Sudeshna and the powerful Charudeha, along with Sucharu, Chharugupta, Bhadracaru, Charuchandra, Vicaru and Caru, the tenth. Pradyumna fathered the greatly powerful Aniruddha in the womb of Rukmavati, the daughter of Rukmi. This took place while they were living in the city of Bhojakata.
13. The ten sons of Satyabhama were Bhanu, Subhanu, Svarbhanu, Prabhanu, Bhanuman, Chandrabhanu, Brihadbhanu, Atibhanu (the eighth), Sribhanu and Pratibhanu. Krishna is an important deity in Hinduism and seen as a very symbolic Lord. Samba, Sumitra, Purujit, Satajit, Sahasrajit, Vijaya, Citraketu, Vasuman, Dravida and Kratu were the sons of Jambavati. These ten, headed by Samba, were their father's favorites. The sons of Nagnajiti were Vira, Candra, Asvasena, Citragu, Vegavan, Vrisha, Ama, Sanku, Vasu and the opulent Kunti.
14. Sruta, Kavi, Vrisha, Vira, Subahu, Bhadra, Santi, Darsa and Purnamasa were sons of Kalindi. Her youngest son was Somaka. Mitravinda's sons were Vrika, Harsha, Anila, Gridhra, Vardhana, Unnada, Mahamsa, Pavana, Vahni and Kshudhi. Sangramajit, Brihatsena, Sura, Praharana, Arijith, Jaya and Subhadra were the sons of Bhadra, together with Vama, Ayur and Satyaka. Lakshmana's sons were Praghosha, Gatravan, Simha, Bala, Prabala, Urdhaga, Mahasakti, Saha, Oja and Aparajita. Diptiman, Tamratapta and others were the sons of Krishna and Rohini.
15. According to Mahabharata, the Kurukshetra war resulted in the death of all 100 sons of Gandhari. On the night before Duryodhana's death, Lord Krishna visited Gandhari to offer his condolences. Gandhari felt that Krishna knowingly did not put an end to the war, and in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari cursed that Krishna, along with everyone else from Yadu dynasty, would perish after 36 years. Krishna himself knew and wanted this to happen as he felt that the Yadavas had become very haughty and arrogant (adharmi), so he ended Gandhari's speech by saying "tathastu" (so be it).



23
16. Krishna never appears to grow old or age at all in the historical depictions of the Puranas despite passing of several decades, but there are grounds for a debate whether this indicates that he has no material body, since battles and other descriptions of the Mahabhārata epic show clear indications that he seems to be subject to the limitations of nature. While battles apparently seem to indicate limitations, Mahabharata also shows in many places where Krishna is not subject to any limitations as through episodes Duryodhana trying to arrest Krishna where his body burst into fire showing all creation within him.[95] Krishna is also explicitly described as without deterioration elsewhere.
17. The bhakti movements devoted to Krishna became prominent in southern India in the 7th to 9th centuries AD. The earliest works included those of the Alvar saints of the Tamil country. A major collection of their works is the Divya Prabandham. The Alvar Andal's popular collection of songs Tiruppavai, in which she conceives of herself as a gopi, is the most famous of the oldest works in this genre. Kulasekaraazhvaar's Mukundamala was another notable work of this early stage. 18. In the Deccan, particularly in Maharashtra, saint poets of the Varkari sect such as Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Janabai, Eknath and Tukaram promoted the worship of Vithoba, a local form of Krishna, from the beginning of the 13th century until the late 18th century. In southern India, Purandara Dasa and Kanakadasa of Karnataka composed songs devoted to the Krishna image of Udupi. Rupa Goswami of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, has compiled a comprehensive summary of bhakti named Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu. 19. In South India, Vaishnavas usually belong to the Sri Sampradaya. The acharyas of the Sri Sampradaya have written reverentially about Krishna in most of their works like the Thiruppavai by Andal and Gopala Vimshati by Vedanta Desika. In South India, devotion to Krishna, as an avatar of Vishnu, spread in the face of opposition to Buddhism, Shaktism, and Shaivism and ritualistic Vedic sacrifices. The acharyas of the Sri Sampradaya like Manavala Mamunigal, Vedanta Desika strongly advocated surrender to Vishnu as the aim of the Vedas. Out of 108 Divya Desams there are 97 Divya Desams in South India. 20. From the 10th century AD, with the growing bhakti movement, Krishna became a favorite subject of the arts. The songs of the Gita Govinda became popular across India, and had many imitations. The songs composed by the Bhakti poets added to the repository of both folk and classical singing. The classical Indian dances, especially Odissi and Manipuri, draw heavily on the story. The 'Rasa lila' dances performed in Vrindavan shares elements with Kathak, and the Krisnattam, with some cycles, such as Krishnattam, traditionally restricted to the Guruvayur temple, the precursor of Kathakali. 21. The most exalted figures in Jainism are the twenty-four Tirthankaras. Krishna, when he was incorporated into the Jain list of heroic figures, presented a problem with his activities which are not pacifist. The concept of Baladeva, Vasudeva and Prati-Vasudeva was used to solve it. The Jain list of sixty-three Shalakapurshas or notable figures includes, amongst others, the twentyfour Tirthankaras and nine sets of this triad. One of these triads is Krishna as the Vasudeva, Balarama as the Baladeva and Jarasandha as the Prati-Vasudeva. He was a cousin of the twentysecond Tirthankara, Neminatha. The stories of these triads can be found in the Harivamsha of
Jinasena (not be confused with its namesake, the addendum to Mahābhārata) and the Trishashtishalakapurusha-charita of Hemachandra. 22. The story of Krishna occurs in the Jataka tales in Buddhism, in the Vaibhav Jataka as a prince and legendary conqueror and king of India. In the Buddhist version, Krishna is called Vasudeva, Kanha and Keshava, and Balarama is his older brother, Baladeva. These details



24
resemble that of the story given in the Bhagavata Purana. Vasudeva, along with his nine other brothers (each son a powerful wrestler) and one elder sister (Anjana) capture all of Jambudvipa (many consider this to be India) after beheading their evil uncle, King Kansa, and later all other kings of Jambudvipa with his Sudarshana Chakra. Much of the story involving the defeat of Kansa follows the story given in the Bhagavata Purana. 23. Bahá'ís believe that Krishna was a "Manifestation of God", or one in a line of prophets who have revealed the Word of God progressively for a gradually maturing humanity. In this way, Krishna shares an exalted station with Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Muhammad, Jesus, the Báb, and the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, Bahá'u'lláh. 24. Members of the Ahmadiyya Community believe Krishna to be a great prophet of God as described by their founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. This belief is maintained by the Qur'anic Principle that God has sent prophets and messengers to every nation of the world leaving no region without divine guidance (see for instance Quran 10:47 and Quran 16:36). There is also a saying reportedly of the Islamic prophet Muhammad which says There was a prophet of God in India who was dark in colour and his name was Kanha. 25. Krishna worship or reverence has been adopted by several new religious movements since the 19th century, and he is sometimes a member of an eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, Biblical and even historical figures. For instance, Édouard Schuré, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and occult movements, considered Krishna a Great Initiate; while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual teacher for humanity along with Buddha. Krishna was canonized by Aleister Crowley and is recognized as a saint in the Gnostic Mass of Ordo Templi Orientis. https://www.speakingtree.in/allslides/shocking-facts-about-lord-krishna-no-one-knows

"The Dwarkadhish temple, also known as the Jagat Mandir and occasionally spelled Dwarakadheesh, is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Krishna, who is worshiped here by the name Dwarkadhish, or 'King of Dwarka'. The temple is located at Dwarka, Gujarat, India. The main shrine of the five storied building, supported by 72 pillars, is known as Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir, archaeological findings suggest it to be 2,000 - 2,200 years old."

Balakrishna, 8th cent. bronze. Mukul Banerjee.
[quote] Bala Krishna (Sanskrit: बाल-कृ ि bālakṛṣṇa, literally "child Krishna") sometimes translated to "Divine Child Krishna",[1] is historically one of the early forms of worship in Krishnaism and an element of the history of Krishna worship in antiquity. This tradition is considered as a part of the number of other traditions that led to amalgamation in a later stage of the historical development and culminate in worship of Radha Krishna as Svayam bhagavan. Other monotheist traditions are Bhagavatism and Cult of Gopala, that along with Cult of Krishna-Vasudeva form the basis of the current tradition of the monotheistic Krishna religion. The worship of Balakrishna, the divine child, while a significant feature of the Krishna religion, often receives less attention, however it is one of the most popular deities of Krishna in many parts of India today. Early evidence of such worship can be found or as early as the 4th century



31
BC according to evidence in Megasthenes and in the Arthasastra of Kautilya, when Vāsudeva (as the son of Vasudeva was worshiped as supreme Deity in a strongly monotheistic format, where the supreme Being was perfect, eternal and full of grace.
Some of the miraculous acts of the form are notable. Its is believed that Putana, a huge monster, was killed when the baby Krishna sucked her life from her by taking the poisoned breast she offered him. Bala-Krishna is often depicted as a small child crawling on his hands and knees or dancing with a piece of butter in his hand.
In the Bhagavad Gita, it appears Krishna is teaching a universal monotheistic religion of personal God and reveals himself to be all-God, svayam bhagavan. The historical fusion of Krishna with Vishnu involved a transfer of many of Vishnu's epithets, as well as his functions, to Krishna. The childhood episodes of Krishna's legend became the focus of the medieval devotional cults that started to develop in a number of movements in medieval India.
The Chola Empire ---------------
The Chola dynasty (Tamil: வசாழை் குைம் [ˈ͡tʃoːɻə]) was a Tamil dynasty which was one of the longest-ruling in some parts of southern India. The earliest datable references to this Hindu dynasty are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BC left by Asoka, a northern ruler; the dynasty continued to reign over varying territory until the 13th century AD.
The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. The whole country south of the Tungabhadra was united and held as one state for a period of two centuries and more. Under Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I, the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and Southeast Asia. The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the celebrated expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the overthrow after an unprecedented naval war of the maritime empire of Srivijaya, as well as by the repeated embassies to China. During the period 1010–1200, the Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh. Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of what is now Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of the Maldives. Rajendra Chola sent a victorious expedition to North India that touched the river Ganges and defeated the Pala ruler of Pataliputra, Mahipala. He also successfully invaded kingdoms of the Malay Archipelago. The Chola dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the Pandyas, who ultimately caused their downfall.
The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in building temples have resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture.The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centres of economic activity.They pioneered a centralised form of government and established a disciplined bureaucracy.



32
The Chola Art ------------
The period of the imperial Cholas (c. 850 CE - 1250 CE) was an age of continuous improvement and refinement of the Dravidian art and architecture. They utilised their prodigious wealth earned through their extensive conquests in building long-lasting stone temples and exquisite bronze sculptures. Most of these still stand proudly articulating those glorious days.
The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes. Among the existing specimens in the various museums of the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, Siva saints and many more. Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptor worked in great freedom in the eleventh and the twelfth centuries and the sculptures and bronzes show classic grace, grandeur and perfect taste. The best example of this can be seen in the form of Nataraja the Divine Dancer.
While the stone sculptures and the inner sanctum image empowering the temple remained immovable, changing religious concepts during the 10th century demanded that the deities take part in a variety of public roles similar to those of a human monarch. As a result, large bronze images were created to be carried outside the temple to participate in daily rituals, processions, and temple festivals. The round lugs and holes found on the bases of many of these sculptures are for the poles that were used to carry the heavy images. Admired for the sensuous depiction of the figure and the detailed treatment of their clothing and jewelry,
Although bronze casting has a long history in south India, a much larger and a much greater number of bronze sculptures were cast during the Chola period than before, further attesting to the importance of bronze sculpture during this period. It should be noted that when in worship, these images are covered in silk cloths, garlands, and jewels, and would not appear as they do outside a religious context. Decorating the bronzes in this way is a tradition at least a thousand years old as such decorations are referred to in 10th-century Chola inscriptions.
Hundreds of Chola bronzes have been smuggled out of India and have found their way into the private museums of art-collectors.
Chola period bronzes were created using the lost wax technique. It is known in artistic terms as "Cire Perdue". The Sanskrit Shilpa texts call it the Madhu Uchchishtta Vidhana. Beeswax and kungilium (a type of camphor) are mixed with a little oil and kneaded well. The figure is sculpted from this mixture fashioning all the minute details. This is the wax model original. The entire figure is then coated with clay made from termite hills until the mould is of a necessary thickness. Then the whole thing is dried and fired in an oven with cow-dung cakes. The wax model melts and flows out, while some of it vapourises.



33
The metal alloy of bronze is melted and poured into the empty clay-mould. This particular bronze alloy is known as Pancha Loham. When the metal has filled all crevices and has settled and hardened and cooled, the mould is broken off. The bronze figure thus obtained is then cleaned, finer details are added, blemishes are removed, smoothened, and polished well. Hence each bronze icon is unique and the mould cannot be used to create copies.
The forms of Chola bronzes are very plastic. They are devoid of intricate ornaments and designs. They are very expressive. There is grace, elegance, beauty, and above all else - life. By means of the facial expressions and gestures or mudras and the pose, we can imagine the surroundings of the figure of the god or goddess; what instrument or weapon he or she is holding; what he or she is leaning on; and what he or she is doing or about to do.
There is a pose called Rishabaandhika pose. We see Siva standing with one leg crossed over to the other side, across the other leg . We see that the way His arm is flexed and raised, it is resting on something. The way that His body is tilted suggests that He is leaning on something. In this scenario, Siva is leaning on his bull-vahana, Nandhi, on whose shoulders He is resting His arm.
The most famous of all the bronze icons is that of Nataraja.The symbolism presents Siva as lord of the cosmic dance of creation and destruction. He is active, yet aloof, like the gods on the Parthenon Frieze. Surrounding Siva, a circle of flames represents the universe, whose fire is held in Shiva's left rear palm. His left front arm crosses his chest, the hand pointing in "elephant trunk" position (gaja hasta) to his upraised left foot, which signifies liberation. His right foot tramples the dwarf Apasmara, who represents ignorance.
Siva's right front hand is raised in the "fear-not" gesture of benediction (abhaya mudra), while his right rear hand holds a drum with which he beats the measure of the dance. The snake, an emblem of Siva, curls around his arm. His hair holds the crescent moon - another emblem - and a small image of Ganges, the river-goddess whose precipitous fall from heaven to earth is broken by Siva's matted locks.
In 1931, Chola frescoes were discovered within the circumambulatory corridor of the Brihadisvara Temple, by S.K.Govindasamy, a professor at the Annamalai University. These are the first Chola paintings discovered. The passage of the corridor is dark and the walls on either side are covered with two layers of paintings from floor to ceiling.
Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments.
During the Nayak period, the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescos lying underneath have an ardent spirit of saivism is expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Chola. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholas en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola_art[unquote]

Greek culture in Afghanistan and India: Shane Wallace. Vaishnavam pre-dates Christ by 2 centuries, Brahmi inscription on Besnagar Heliodorus pillar.
Commemoration by erecting a yūpa (skambha) is a tradition traceable to Binjor on Saravati River Basin which evidences अष्टाशि yūpa of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization ca. 2500 BCE commemorating Soma Samsthā yāga (in Rigveda tradition). I suggest that the cakra atop the Vishnordhvaja of Chandragupta Vikramaditya signifies vajra as caṣāla of Skambha (yūpa) in Rigveda tradition (of Khamb baba in local tradition, of Atharva Veda Skambha sukta AV X.7,8) -- a metaphor which unites Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva traditions related to ancient metallurgy (carburization of metal using godhūma, wheat-chaff carbon fumes) of Bhāratam Janam.
The abiding mint/metallurgical traditions are traceable to: (1) Heliodorus Vishnordhvaja and Antialkidas coins of ca. 110 BCE and (2) Harappa Script hypertext signifiers (elephant, spokedwheel, yūpa -- as at अष्टाशि yūpa of Binjor on Sarasvati River basin) of metal-/mint-work.

On ancient coins, Antialkidas wears a helmet with bull's horns or a flat kausia. An elephant appears on the reverse/obverse of many coins. This is a Harappa Script hieroglyph which signifies Meluhha: karba, ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'; ibbo 'merchant.
He also appears to brandish a spear on one coin. A thunderbolt appears over his shoulder on another coin.

Abstract
In 1888 Rudyard Kipling published a collection of short-stories entitled The Phantom Rickshaw and Other Eerie Tales. Perhaps the most famous of these stories, ‘The Man Who Would Be King’, recounted the adventures of two British military veterans, Peachy Carnahan and Daniel Dravot Esq., played by Michael Caine and Sean Connery in John Huston's 1975 film of the same name. Both men have seen India's cities and jungles, jails and palaces, and have decided that she is too small for the likes of they. So, they set out to become kings of Kafiristan, a mountainous, isolated, and unstudied country beyond the Hindu Kush in north-eastern Afghanistan. They confide their plan to their recent acquaintance Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer), then editor of the Northern Star, who calls them mad. No man, he says, has made it to Kafiristan since Alexander the Great, to which Peachy replies ‘If a Greek can do it, we can do it.’ What they find in north-eastern Afghanistan are the last remnants of Alexander the Great's empire, a local culture and religion part-Greek and part-Kafiri. The story is fiction, but aspects of its historical context are true. Alexander spent most of the years 330–325 campaigning in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, and he left behind Greek kingdoms and culture that flourished throughout the Hellenistic period and even later. Traces of these Greek kingdoms are continually coming to light and the archaeological, artistic, and epigraphic evidence coming out of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India reveals a prosperous and culturally diverse kingdom.

The pillar of Heliodora, India
[quote]This pillar, from modern Besnagar, is a dedication to the god Vasudeva and preserves the dedicatory inscription of one Heliodora son of Diya of Takhkhasila (Heliodoros son of Dion of Taxila), a ‘Greek’ ambassador from King Amtalikita (Antialkidas). It dates from the late second century.56
The script is Brahmi but the language is Prakrit. Excavationsfrom 1963 to 1965



41
detected the remains of an elliptical temple building around the pillar which dated from the fourth century. Other pillars originally stood on site, and at least three capitals have been found. The Heliodora pillar, like Heliodotos’ altar, existed as part of a wider religious complex.57

This Garuda-pillar of Vãsudeva, the god of gods, was constructed here by Heliodora, the Bhãgavata, son of Diya, of Takhkhasilã, the Greek ambassador who came from the Great King Amtalikita to King Kãsîputra Bhãgabhadra, the Savior, prospering in (his) fourteenth regnal year. (These?) three steps to immortality, when correctly followed, lead to heaven: control, generosity, and attention.58
A man with an Indianized Greek name dedicates an Indian-style pillar, in an Indian language, at an Indian religious site, to an Indian deity. He is clearly presenting himself within an Indian cultural and religious context. This is possibly connected with his mission to the Indian court, but as a resident of Taxila in Pakistan – a site which has produced evidence of Indian deities – it is possible that Heliodora was already a worshipper of Vasudeva.

As with the dedication of Heliodotos and the stele of Sophytos, this monument is culturally monolingual, but it does describe Heliodora as a yona-dutena or ‘Greek ambassador’ of King Amtalikita, known from his frequently bilingual coins as Antialkidas Nikephoros, who ruled part of the Punjab in the late second and early first centuries (see figure 3). We do not know whether this is Heliodora’s self-representation as the pillar’s dedicator or a description of him by the text’s author, but it highlights a strong contrast between the Indian context of the dedication and theGreek definition of the dedicator. With his movement from the royal court of an Indo-Greek king to the religious world of Indian dedications, Heliodora expresses – but does not necessarily prove – a greater degree of cultural fluency than Sophytos. By the use of a specific ethnic title, this monument reveals his cultural bilingualism, moving from a Greek diplomatic context to an Indian religious one. However, this dedication is a single moment in Heliodora’s life.We do not



42
know how he would have presented himself in a Greek text or a Greek context, nor do we know how his Indian and Greek identities overlapped in his family, upbringing, daily life, or career.

A series of administrative texts from throughout Bactria reveal the stratigraphy of the ruling class during the Hellenistic period. From thesedocuments it appears that the upper echelon of the administration consisted primarily of people with Greek names, while the lower echelon consisted by and large of people with Bactrian and Iranian names. While such social stratigraphy might reflect the realities of a bilingual administrative system – Greek at the upper levels, Bactrian at the lower – it might also represent the use of situational identities, whereby a person assumed different cultural identities in different contexts, meaning that a Greek name might reflect an individual’s position in the Greco-Macedonian socio-political hierarchy rather than his ethnicity. In short, we should be careful not to ascribe ethnicity from names alone. [unquote](pp.222-224)

Bhagabhadra was one of the kings of the Indian Sunga dynasty. Heruled in north, central, and e astern India around 110 BCE. Although the capital of the Sungas was at Pataliputra, hewas also k nown to have held court at Vidisha.
He is best known from an inscription at the site of Vidisha in central India, the Heliodorus pillar, in which contactswith an embassy from the IndoGreek king Antialcidas is recorded, and where he is named "KasiputraBhagabhadra, the Saviorso n of the princess from Benares":
:"Devadevasa Va [sude] vasa Garudadhvajo ayam:"karito i [a] Heliodorena bhaga- :"vatena Di yasa putrenaTakhasilakena:"Yonadatena agatena maharajasa:"Amtalikitasa upa [m] ta samkas amrano :"Kasiput [r] asa [Bh] agabhadrasa tratarasa:"vasena [chatu] dasena rajena vadhamanas a"

This inscription is important in that in tends to validate that the Sungas ruled in the area of Vidisa around 100 BCE. This is also corroborated by some artistic realization on the nearby Sanchi st upa thought to belong to the period of the Sungas. Altogether, three Sunga pillars have also bee n found in the area.

It is thought that name Bhagabhadra also appears in the regnal lists of the Sungas in the Puranic r ecords, underthe name Bhadraka, fifth Sunga ruler of the Sungas. http://partners.academic.ru/dic. nsf/enwiki/1820831

Inscription on the board by ASI on the base of the pillar
First inscription of Heliodorus, 110 BCE
The second inscription on the pillar describes in more detail the spiritual content of the faith supported by Heliodorus:



50
Trini amutapadani‹[su] anuthitani
nayamti svaga damo chago apramado
Three immortal precepts (footsteps)... when practiced lead to heaven: self-restraint, charity, conscientiousness
"It is also interesting to note that the Heliodorus column has other historical merits. Around the turn of the century, a number of Indologists (Weber, Macnicol, and others) had noted " points of similarity' between the Vaisnava philosophy of unalloyed devotion and Christian doctrine. They had argued that Vaishnavism (worship of Visnu and Krsna) must have been an offshoot of Christianity, and cited the similarity between stories about Krsna and about Christ to further support their claim.(9) But the discovery of the inscription on the Heliodorus column laid their speculations to rest. Here was conclusive archaeological proof that the Vaisnava tradition antedated Christianity by at least two hundred years.
The column also struck down another popular notion. For centuries it was a common belief among scholars that India's orthodox tradition did not accept converts. An Islamic historian, Abu Raihan Alberuni, who went to India in A.D. 1017, tried to explain in his book Indica why the Indian orthodoxy did not admit foreigners. Alberuni suggested that the practice developed only after the Moslem incursion into India, sometime after A.D. 674.(10) Antagonism between the Moslems and Hindus seems to be the main reason behind the non conversion practice. For many centuries prior to Moslem presence, however, there had been no bar to conversion into the orthodox fold, as attested by the Heliodorus column."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliodorus_pillar Indo-Greeks: Antialcidas (c. 115-95 BCE) Antialcidas (also spelled Antialkidas) was one of the few Indo-Greek kings for whom we have evidence other than his coins. A few miles from the ancient city of Sanchi, there is a stone pillar (known as the Heliodorus pillar) that mentions him as the Greek king who sent his ambassador Heliodorus to the court of the king Bhagabhadra. At the time, the Sungas ruled in the area, so Bhagabhadra must have been a Sunga king. The purpose of the embassy is not specified. In all likelihood, Antialcidas followed Lysias in the area of Kabul and Kapisa. The two kings share all the same monograms, and there exist two mule coins that consist of the obverse of one king and the reverse of the other. The common monograms and the mules show that the two kings used the same mints, either contemporaneously or, more probably, in immediate sequence.

Antialcidas issued at least four different types of Attic weight tetradrachms which carried only Greek legends. These included two with the helmeted bust, as on this coin, but with two different legend arrangements (see next coin for the other arrangement), and one each with a bare-headed bust and a bust with the king wearing a kausia.He also issued at least two different monolingual drachms, a helmeted type and a kausia type. Thus his Attic coinage was the most extensive of all the Greek kings who ruled south of the Hindu Kush. Whether this was because he acquired territory in Bactria, north of the Hindu Kush, or simply an indication of a stronger nostalgia for the days when Greek kings ruled in Bactria, is not known. By this time, as far as we can tell, Bactria was under Scythian rule. (photo, courtesy CNG)
