HONFOGLALÁS... THE MAGYARS ARE BACK HOME
The Honfoglalás, (“conquest of the homeland” or “return” according to ancient Hungarian sources) is the last stage of a long trail that Hungarian populations, who were originally settled in the Carpathian Basin, travelled from the end of the second millennium B.C. to the end of the first millennium A.D..
Out of the Carpathian Basin
The arrival in Europe of the nomadic, war faring, pastoralist Celts at the beginning of the third millennium B.C. (first urn field in Europe, in the Balkan area: 2.700 B.C., Hencken) provoked, at the end of the second millennium B.C., large migrations of farmers from Pannonia to neighbouring and to far away lands:
• to Northern Europe: the first conical hats attested in Europe are the ones of the Venus of Willendorf, Pannonia (23.000 B.C., Historical Museum, Vienna, AT), of the Venus of Savignano, IT, (18.000 – 10.000 B.C., Museo Etnografico Pigorini, Rome, IT) and of the figurines found in Vinča, Pannonia, (5.000 B.C., Gimbuteniė). In the 16th–10th century B.C., the high priest(e)s(ses?) of Ezelsdorf (Nürnberg, DE), Shifferstadt (Ludvigshafen, DE), Avanton (Poitier, FR), and of the unknown place where the Berlin Museum conical hat was found (Schwarzwald?, DE), wore gold conical headdresses. One of these conical headdresses is supposed to be a Metonic Calendar (19 years cycle calendar, several centuries later re-discovered by the Greek Meton, 500 B.C.). Calendars, or supposed calendars, are a pre-Indo-European cultural marker spread all over Europe. These conical headdresses and the archaeological finds of that time in Europe are decorated with the same designs found in the Carpathian Basin over the previous millennia. The gold of the disk of the Nebra calendar (hidden underground in 1600 B.C. in Mittelburg, Halle, DE; but manufactured in 2000 B.C.) came from the Carpathian Mountains of the Siebenburger region, Erdely, RO (E. Pernicka, University of Freiberg, DE). In Shassburg (Siebenburger, Erdely, RO), typical Pannonico decorations and a calendar that the local Museum claims to be the oldest European calendar have been found (Bronze age, Shassburg Museum, Erdely, RO). Those high priest(e)s(ses?) were Pannonico migrants, who brought the Bronze Age to Nordia (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, USA). Those Pannonico migrants are likely those who brought their culture to Finnia: in a grave in Pribaltika, dated 800 A.D., the same spiral bracelets, dotted circles, and collars that had been used in Pannonia since 2000 years earlier, have been found (see the book “Magyar Art...”).
Migrations from the Carpathian Basin to Northern Europe have also been hypothesised at earlier times. • to Italy (Padania, Etruria, and Puglia): the Messapi are supposed to have migrated to Puglia, from Illyria, at the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C.. They wore conical headdresses (Siponto stelae, decorated with the same designs used in Pannonia), they were ruled by the Flavio “Daranthoa”, the general assembly of the population, and they were organized in a Flavio Confederation. The Terramare (Padania) culture, from which somebody has hypothesised that the Etruscan culture derived, does show typical Pannonico markers. • to the lands around Dzungaria: the Arsi, (Arsikantu, in Arsian; Or-hsi in Chinese, the so-called “Indo-European” Tocharians!) settled in Pazyryk and, later on, in the Tarim Basin and West Tien Shan. G. S. Lane (Chicago University, U.S.A) hypothesised that this population came there with the



“Pontic migration”, at the beginning of the first millennium B.C., from a region bordering to Greece, Italy, Germany and an area where unspecified FinnoUgric populations lived (i.e.: Pannonia). This migration would explain the traces of Hungarian (G. S. Lane, Mark Dickens) and other European languages in Tocharian. Instead, Tocharian was a Gandhara (India) dialect brought there by Buddhist priests; it did not come from Europe. All the populations associated to these migrations were not Indo-Europeans, or “proto-Celts”, but Pannonici fleeing the Celts (see “The Magyar Art...”).
Settlement in Central Asia
Archaeology has found around Dzungaria (Pazyryk, Altai, Russia; Tarim Basin, Xin Jiang, China) kurgans dated back to the 9th century B.C.– 3rd century A.D., which contained Pannonico artefacts and mummies of dolichocephalic, Europoid, red or blond-haired people, who were: • genetically close to the Russian Finno-Ugric populations (Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, RU; the Hungarians have not been considered); • culturally related to the Celts (V. H. Mair and J. P. Mallory). (On “Magyar Art...” it will be made clear that those “Celts” were actually Pannonici). • linguistically tied to the Hungarians (G. S. Lane, M. Dickens). Other similar, rich kurgans have been found in Aržan (Kyzil, Tuva, Russia). One of these kurgans, C14 dated 620 B.C., contained 22 kg of gold artefacts, collars, and amber. In Esik (Alma Ata, Kazakhstan) a Shaman-Amazon-Princess (according to J. Davis-Kimball) was buried, with her gold garments, in the 5th century B.C.. All the populations dwelling along the north western silk route (Tarim Basin Tanaïs) in the 2nd century B.C. – 2nd century A.D. shared common fenotypical features (“macaque appearance”, according to the definition of Yan Shigu: prognatism and receding chin), and cultural markers, which belonged to Pannonia and which shall reappear in the Carpathian Basin at the time of the Honfoglalás. A genetic research (J. D. McDonald, University of Illinois, USA) shows that the Y Chromosome R1a, in the mid of the 1st millennium B.C., had its highest values and was the main component in Central-Eastern Europe, in Central Asia, and along a corridor, that links the two regions. This corridor coincides with the trail of the northern silk route and with the route twice covered by the Hungarians, from and to Hungary. The high frequency and the spread of R1a in a wide region of Europe prove that R1a moved from Europe to Central Asia and back to Hungary. The presence of R1b (Basque, only frequent in Western Europe) around Dzungaria proves that Europeans brought there both R1a and R1b, from Europe. The presence of R1b in modern Hungary, in a percentage comparable to that of the neighbouring populations, proves that the Magyars had previously lived in Europe, the only place where they could have intermingled with the Basques, in ancient times. All the “Scythian” populations of northern Eurasia cannot be linked to the Greek Culture, because they predated the Greeks (Mikhail Piotrovsky, Hermitage, Sankt Petersburg, RU). These ancient, European, Pannonico populations, partly mixed with the Celts, brought to Central Asia cultural traits, which cannot, in any case, be related to the “Indo-European culture”, and which shall later reappear in Europe (where these traits had disappeared centuries earlier) with the Middle Age migrations from Central Asia.
Other (no return) migrations of the Hungarians
The Pannonici could have reached Linzi (Shandong, North East China), and Yunnan (South West China). A genetic research (Wang, Matsushita) has concluded that the ancient Linzis, who buried their horses, show “the smallest genetic distances from the Turks, Icelanders, and Finns” (The Hungarians have not been considered in this research). Furthermore, the genetic similarity of the Linzis of 500 A.D. and the



modern Japanese would prove a migration of the Linzis to Japan. Another genetic research (H.-J. Bandelt) has confirmed the previous one by concluding that “The Linzis had features in common with the Yunnan populations”. In fact, V. H. Mair (Pennsylvania University, U.S.A) has found “ancient frescos of Europoid equestrians, wearing Central Asian clothing, in Yunnan”. In a large area around Yunnan, roughly corresponding to the Dong Son cultural area (8th century B.C.), non Han minorities still use conical hats, trousers and leggings, and share animistic religion, Mother or Sun Goddesses, democracy, egalitarianism, matriarchy... The Linzis could have been those blonde populations, who contributed to the Chinese civilization, according to Chinese sources, and who, after having been subjugated by Emperor Chin (221 B.C.), could have migrated to Korea (Silla) and later to Japan (Yamatai). Mair said: “The new finds are also forcing a re-examination of old Chinese books that describe historical or legendary figures of great height, with deep-set blue or green eyes, long noses, full beards, and red or blond hair. Scholars have traditionally scoffed at these accounts, but it now seems that they may be accurate”. Mair is also convinced that the Tarim Basin shall be the Eldorado of our century’s archaeologists. I agree with him: the ancestors of the Hungarians, and their Rovàs, are under the sand of that desert. Japan was reached by the Ainu, a blue-eyed, Europoid population, who had left a cultural trail behind them along the Amur Valley (Smithsonian Institution, U.S.A.), which points to Buryatia (RU) and Kyzil (Tuva, RU). The attacks of the Huns, recorded by history, from the South, through the Orkhon valley, to the populations living in Tuva and Buryatia could have pushed these populations to descend the Amour and reach the Pacific Ocean (see “The Magyar Art...”).
Honfoglalás
The Pazyryki (Scythians, Siraces, Issedones, Wusun, Arsi, Parthians, Alans, Kushans...) were the masters of the Silk Road from 500 B.C. to 330 A.D.. Similar figurines of Europoids with long beards and hair, who were riding camels or horses and were wearing trousers, soft boots, jackets, and conical hats, have been found along the Silk Road from Tanaïs to China and Korea (Archaeological Museum of Shanghai, CN; National Museum of Korea, et alia). In 166 A.D., the Romans opened the sea route to China (Emperor Antoninus, Hou Han Shou Chronicles). In 330 A.D., the Chinese stopped garrisoning the eastern branch of the Silk Road – the Gan Su Corridor (A. Herrmann, Harvard University Press). In the 5th century, the fall of the Roman Empire wiped out the European demand for Chinese goods. In the 7th century, the emerging Islam became the privileged outlet for the Chinese luxury goods. In the Middle Age, Chinese junks, which could carry up to 1000 people including a military escort, sailed the routes from Arabia to China (Ibn Battuta). Trading along the Northern silk route started fading in the 4th century A.D. and died out with the Islam conquest of Central Asia. From the beginning of the 1st millennium A.D., the Silk Road Central Asian populations (Scythians, Siraces, Jaziges, Alans, Sarmatians, Bulgars, Huns, Avars, ...), started migrating westwards and finally reached the Balkans and the Carpathian Basin. All these populations shared a common culture, the one of the Pazuyryki and of the Arsi of Central Asia, who had earlier come from Pannonia. At the same time, several cultural and anthropological traits were migrating from Central Asia to the Carpathian Basin. In the first half of the 9th century, the Uyghurs invaded the Tarim Basin. At this time, the Arsi that lived in the Tarim Basin joined other populations north of the Black Sea and lead them to the Hungarian Plain.
Cultural markers, which spread together with the Pannonico migrants and traders, from Pannonia to Arsia and back to Hungary



The migrations of the Pannonici to Asia and back to Europe can be reconstructed by the trail of European cultural markers that they left in the places they passed through.
“Fashion”:
• The conical headdress existed in Europe since the Palaeolithic. It was later
worn in Phoenicia (since the 5th millennium B.C., terracotta Mother Goddess, National Museum of Beirut, Lebanon, up until the present day conical Lebbadé hat), in Sumeria (24th century B.C.), and in Troy (worn by the red-haired Paris, Aphaia temple, Ægina, GR). Such a large spread roughly corresponds to the Neanderthal range and to an area where agglutinative languages were spoken before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans and of the Semites. At the end of the 2nd millennium B.C., the conical headdresses and the Pannonico culture spread from the Carpathian Basin to Germany and Pomerania (1500 B.C.), to Cimmeria (1300 B.C.), Maeotia, and Caucasia (Kuban Valley and Urartu); to Italy (Messapia: 9th century B.C.); to Etruria (Haruspex headdress); to the Southern Ural region (Filippovka, Pokrovka, 8th6th century B.C.); to Pazyryk and Esik; to the Tarim Basin and to West Tien Shan (Oxiana and Saka, 6th – 4th B.C.), and to Kushania (Tillia Tepe and King Kanishta, 2nd B.C. – 2nd AD). The conical headdress became common to all the peoples along the northern silk route (Scythians, Parthians, Arsi, Alans, Kushans, Karakalpakstanis, Tanaïs...). The conical headdress and the Pannonico culture, which had disappeared in Europe 1500 years earlier, finally reached Chuvashia and Hungary. The conical headdresses used by the Matyo, Poloc, and Mari are more similar to the most ancient European and Central Asian headdresses, than to the Honfoglalás Magyar headdress: they may have survived during those 1500 years in which the Pannonici were not at home. The Chudes (a Finnic population that was dwelling in Nordia, Pribaltika, and what is now European Russia, and who have made the Rus hair русый, still used a conical headdress when (1539 A.D.) Olearius drew the Charta Marina. The same Mikhail 3rd (a Romanov prince of Moscovia), at the end of the 17th century, was depicted with a conical headdress. Conical headdresses still belonged to the 20th century local folklore in: Finland, the Volga/Kama region, Southern Siberia (Ethnographic Museum, Sankt Petersburg, RU), Hokkaido (Ainu Ethnographic Museum, Budapest, HU, neprajz.hu; Khabarowsk Museum, RU), Karakalpakstan and Uzbekistan (karakalpakstan.com and Hermitage, Sankt Petersburg, RU), Kalash valley (where an isolate blond population has found a refugium in a remote valley at the Pakistan/Afghanistan northern borders), Kazakhstan (bridal hats, Rudenko; China.com>minorities), Tuva, Buryatia, Xin Jiang, Gan Su, Yunnan (china.com>minorities), and in the regions of Thailand, Myanmar and Deccan, where the Hill Tribes had arrived from Yunnan. The same peoples who used conical headdresses in Northern Eurasia also wore trousers (both men and women), shirts, cloaks, knickers, belts, leggings, and soft boots. When the Germans appeared in Central Europe, they also wore trousers and cloaks, a non Indo-European habit that they had learnt in Scandinavia. The Pannonici used conical headdresses, soft boots, trousers, and jackets since 5,000 B.C. (figurines published by Gimbuteniė), and still did when they came back to Europe.
Religion • Bear cult: in the Palaeolithic, the inhabitants of Central Europe, from Franconia to Silesia, kept consecrated bear skulls in their caves and polished the bear teeth (H. Kühn), as the Ainu still do. The thanksgiving celebration in honour of the soul of the bear was astonishingly similar and performed with similar procedures by the Finns, the Siberians, and the Ainu (F. Maraini).



The bear cult was replaced by the Stag cult in Northern Eurasia up until the Indo-Europeans brought their lions (see “Magyar Art...”). • Naturalistic, Shamanistic, Animism spread from Europe, along the steppes, as far as to southern Siberia, Yunnan, and Japan (Daoism and Shintoism, Ainu and Yunnan animism). The Jomon culture of Japan also appears to have been animistic at its end and Japan is still substantially animistic. Animism is still the official religion of the Republic of Tuva, RU, and is still practiced by the Kalash, the Ewenki and the Yunnan tribes that migrated to Thailand, Myanmar and Deccan. Shamanism finally came back to Europe with the Magyars and their Taltos. • Mother Goddess cult: from the female statuettes of the European Palaeolithic (Venus of Willendorf) and of the Neolithic Carpathian Basin, to the Celtic Cybele of the Galatians, to the Goddesses of Yunnan, to the Hungarian, syncretic, Babba Maria. • Burial rites: inhumation (a Neanderthalian rite, as opposed to the IndoEuropean cremation rite), kurgans, barrows, tumuli, cairns, which contained horses and death masks, have been found all along the route from Irna (Eire), Sammallahdenmäki (Finland, UNESCO world heritage), Vix (Burgundy, FR, where a blond princess was buried with her cart), to Central Asia, Altai, Buryatia, Shandong, Korea (Silla Culture), and Japan (Kofun=Tumulus Culture). The burials of the time of the Honfoglalás contained death masks, horses, carts, and harnesses, as they did in Central Europe more than 1500 years earlier.
Social and political structures • Matriarchy: from the Mother goddesses of Willendorf and of the Carpathian Basin, to the Amazons, to the Scythian Princess Tomyris (who headed the army that killed the Persian king Cyrus), to the princesses of Central Asia, to the three Silla ruling queens of Korea, to the half dozen ruling Empresses of Yamatai (Japan), to the present day Yunnan, non-Han, populations, who astonishingly remind one of the social structure of the Amazons (e.g.: the Mosuo of Yunnan, Orie Endo, Bankui University, Japan). • Democracy, Egalitarianism, and elected chieftains: from the Etruscans, to the Novgorodians of Finnia, to the Kalash of Pakistan, up until Arpad. A Council elected king Almos, the father of Arpad. The Council was presided by a Taltos and decided that the land should be equally distributed to all the people (Stephan Sisa). In northern Europe, the Ting, ruling general assembly of the population, elected non-hereditary, ruling, civil servants for a term and not for life. The Ting survived in Flavia and all along the route travelled by the Magyars: kokous and käräjät (Finland), Thing (Scandinavia), Veče (Holmgard, preRussian Novgorod), Daranθoa (Messapia, IT), Witenagebot (Norse England), kuriltai (Mongolia), khural (Buryatia), khan kutermiak (Turkestans), Loya Jirga and Shura (Afghanistan), Jestak-han (Kalash, Pakistan), and back to Europe with the qoriltay (Bashkiria), the király and the elected biro (Hungary). These institutions were the ancestors of the Athenian general Assembly, which was gathered 10 times a year, and of the Roman republican Senate. (The Ting was never an “Indo-German” Institution. It never existed in Germany except when Göbbels used its name for the gatherings of nazis obliged to listen to his propaganda).
• Confederations (as opposed to Indo-European Empires). The “Dodecapolis” were the Etruscan, Messapic, Scythian, and Helladic (non-Greek) Confederations. All the pre-Indo-European populations and those culturally influenced by the migrating Pannonici, in Central Asia and Yunnan, were organized in confederations. After the arrival of the Indo-Europeans in Europe, the Old Continent, since the time of the Roman Empire, has always



been ruled by Tyrannoi, Kings, Emperors, and Feudal “agents” chosen by the Kings or the Emperors. To day, the Empires are over. The ancient Old European civilization is back again: after 2,000 years, Europe is ruled by a Confederation again; women and minorities have equal rights, and “chieftains” are elected, for a term, by the people, as it was in Flavia 3,000 years ago, as it was in Pazyrykia and Arsia, as it was at the early time of the Magyars.
Culture • Trading culture and, consequently, seafaring and equestrian culture. Vinča was the European hub of the Neolithic trading links; Pannonia was the hub of the Bronze Age trade. The “foreign” dolichocephalic long-bearded traders, who rode camels or horses and wore conical hats and trousers were Pannonici, who mastered the Silk Road, from Tanaïs to Korea. The Ainu were the merchants who controlled the trade between Japan and the Amur valley. The “hit and run technique” or “feigned retreat” was common to the Cimmerians, Amazons, Scythians, Parthians, Siberians, Silla Koreans, Emishi Ainu, and to the Magyars on their arrival in Europe. • Peace loving culture. The ancient graves in the Carpathian Basin did not contain weapons (Susan Tomory), nor the “Scythian” kurgans did, apart from daggers, a defensive tool. No weapons have been found in Arsia. The “Scythians” dwelling north of the Danube, the Linzis, and the Novgorodians refused confrontation respectively with Darius, Chin, and the Mongols. Maybe the Arsi of the Tarim Basin, when the Uyghurs invaded the Basin, did the same. Several Central Asian and Yunnan populations, instead of fighting and being exterminated, preferred migrate and survive in mountainous refugia (the Kalash, the Hill tribes...). • Suicide: the rulers committed suicide if they failed to accomplish their mission (could this be true for the Italian rulers, who allow Naples to be covered by “monnezza” and do not even resign!) from Celtia (Brennan after having been defeated by Furius Camillus; the Numantines, in order not to be enslaved by the Romans...) to China (Confucius, mandate of heaven), to the Samurais. A remains of this habit was the right that the Athenians had to kill their τυραννος, (who, being Indo-European, was not willing to commit suicide or resign). Caesar was killed by the Senate in order to prevent a τυραννος from ruling Rome. • Skull elongation, according to K. F. Smirnov (Academy of Sciences of USSR) originated in the second half of the 1st millennium B.C. in the region including Altai, Tien Shan, and Pamir (i.e. in Pazyrykia). This habit may have been brought to Central Asia by the Yue-chi/Thogary (Smirnov), a red-haired, green-eyed, Europoid, population that migrated in 160 B.C. from the Gan Su Corridor (West China) to Bactria and Sogdiana, and later founded the Kushan “Empire”. Later on, it spread to the Alans, the Sarmathians and the Huns, in Oxiana and north of the Caspian Sea. It finally reached the Carpathian Basin and Chuvashia (map after J. Werner, Castle Museum, Budapest, HU). • Designs of tattoos and of decorations are common to the Picts, the Celts, the peoples along the northern silk route, the Ainu, and the Iban of Borneo (Dong Son). Tattoo was alien to both the Indo-Europeans and the Hans. Emperor Chin sentenced criminals to be tattooed, so that they could be recognized. Scythian slaves in Athens were spread orange ochre so to be recognized.
Language
• Traces of Hungarian language have been found in the Tarim Basin (G. S. Lane University of Chicago, USA), Tibet (Körösi Csaba Sandor), Manchuria (James Xueyuan Zhu, IACD, Korea), Yugria (Khanty, Mansi...). The Ugrian populations still surviving in Siberia, along the Ob and Yennisey rivers, could be survivors



of Pazyryk, Kyzil and of the Minusinsk Basin populations. They fled the Huns and descended the rivers, when the Huns attacked the region (second half of the first millennium B.C., A. Herman). The Indo-Germanists and the Indo-Iranists label the Scythians as “war faring Indo-Iranian speakers”. As only 5 (five) glossae of Scythian language are known, this theory is pure Indo-Iranist speculation.
Music and Mythology • A map of Central Asia (University of Texas website, Lendvai, Vavrinecz Béla), reconstructs the migrations of a Magyar tribe from the analysis of northern Eurasian mythology and music. The pattern of that migration is congruent with the map of the Hungarian migrations in the book “Honfoglalás...”. • Throat (or overtone) singing is a technique by which a single vocalist produces two distinct tones simultaneously. This singing technique is spread from Northern Europe (Saami), to Uzbekistan (Karakalpakstan), Kazakhstan, Altai, Khakassia, Tuva, Buryatia, Western Mongolia, Hokkaido (Ainu), Chukchi Peninsula (Bering Straits), Northern Canada (Inuit), and... back to Bashkiria and Hungary (Wikipedia).
Alphabet • The Pannonico rovás, which derived from the Vinča script, existed in Europe in the middle of the second millennium B.C. and were copied by the Ugaritics, the Phoenicians, the Greeks and the Etruscans. The 16-letter rovás were brought to Northern Europe (Finnish runes) by a Pannonico population (see “Magyar Art...”). There they became 24-letter Germanico runes. In Central Asia, the 16-letter rovás evolved into Magyar rovás (see the book “The Ugaritic abjad...”). All along the trail of the Hungarian migrations, alphabets with signs similar to those of the Magyar rovás and representing a similar phonology have been found (see the book “Magyar Art...”).
The Pannonici have dwelled in the Carpathian Basin during at least several millennia. Some of them migrated. The Magyars came back home with their old European alphabet.
Art and religion • See the book “The Magyar art...”
Alternative theories
• Istvan Kiszely listed some proofs of the presence of the Magyars in the regions around Dzungaria (these proofs fill in a couple of pages of my book), but he, or his friends, insists in placing the urheimat in Yugria, which is some thousand kilometres far from the evidence he found. (Wikipedia). However, he did not identify the population which would later became the Magyars. Thus, he was unable to compare any population to the Bronze Age Pannonici. If he had, he would have found the truth (see the book “Magyar Art...”) • Turkics and Huns: in the last two centuries, the Hungarians started looking for their origins. At the time of the European nationalisms, everybody in Europe was looking for illustrious fathers. The Germans found war faring, nomadic,



pastoralist, ancestors.... Mussolini tried to revive the Roman Empire... Hitler revived the Walhalla, the runes, and the Ting. The Hungarians thought that the Turkish Empire or the Hun “Empire” could be good for their purpose. Empires were not part of the “cultural DNA” of the Magyars. The Hun “Empire” never existed: it is not enough to raid territories to make them become an Empire. The Turks and the Huns did have some cultural traits in common with the Magyars (both arrived in Europe with the same Pannonico conical headdress!) simply because they had lived, in Central Asia, close to the Magyars and had been partially acculturated by them (not vice versa!). The Pannonico culture was the leading culture in Europe in the Bronze Age (see the book “The Magyar Art...”); the Pazyryko culture was hegemonic in Central Asia, without ever being an Empire, approximately for the same period of time that goes from the foundation of Rome to the fall of the Roman Empire. • Finno-Ugric theory: the Hungarians reject on emotional, unscientific grounds the Finno-Ugric theory simply because they assume that it has been politically used against them. The humanity is grateful to Nobel for having invented the dynamite, but does not consider him responsible for the massacres caused by other people who used dynamite in war. Furthermore, in the scientific community out of Hungary, apart from A. Marcantonio, there are no doubts about the linguistic Finno-Ugric theory: some American Universities put Finnish and Hungarian studies in the same department: the department of Central Asian studies! The reality is that the Finns could be the blood brothers of the Hungarians and they are certainly their cultural brothers (See the book “The Magyar Art...”).
• Sumers: I do believe that the Sumers were connected to the Hungarians. The Sumers could have been the Middle Eastern populations, who, fleeing the incoming Semites, could have brought agriculture and/or their culture from Mesopotamia to Europe. Nevertheless, it could even be that Pannonici of the Gold Idol civilization migrated to Mesopotamia in the Copper Age (see the book “The Magyar Art...”). I do believe that the Sumerian language is tied to all the agglutinative languages, and in particular to the Ugro-Finnic languages (Simo Parpola, Helsinki University, FI: “the entire central core of the Sumerian vocabulary - more than 1700 basic words and morphemes - can be successfully matched with Uralic etyma”, 53rd congress of Assyriology, Moscow, July 2007).
László Botos: “The formation of the Magyar people cannot be tied to the Sumerian, Scythian, Hun, Sabirian, Avar, Parthian, Turkish peoples. Even so, the Magyars, during their long history, were connected to the above-mentioned peoples.” (“The Homeland reclaimed”). And... certainly, all those peoples were not “nomadic, warrior, pastoralists”! In fact, all those peoples belonged to the same, great, pre-Indo-European civilization of Agglutinia.... whoever was first: the Sumers, the Trypillians or the Pannonici (See the book “Magyar Art...).
However, what can be reliably demonstrated by archaeology is that Pannonici, in the Late Bronze Age, migrated from Pannonia to the territories around Dzungaria and that they came back to Europe at the time of the Honfoglalás (See the book “The Magyar Art...”).
