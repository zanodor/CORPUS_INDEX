PREFACE
The purpose of this book is to show how man's idea of God
developed from prehistoric antiquity to the time of Christ, and to place this development in its historical context. This task does not, however, consist merely in the accumulation of his
torical details ; it involves an analysis of the historical patterns
which emerge from the mass of detail. It is, therefore, a task both for the historian and for the philosopher of history. Since
the purpose of the book is thus both historical and philosophical, it becomes a matter of fundamental importance to define the respective functions of the historian and of the phi
losopher as clearly and precisely as possible. Only by the great
est care can we avert the vagueness of thought and the illogical formulation of conclusions which appear to be generally char
acteristic of works dealing with the philosophy of history.
Chapter I is largely devoted to the methods by which ancient
Near-Eastern history has been developed in the past century from a little collection of scattered facts to a vast and well
integrated body of knowledge. It may be observed in passing
that this sketch is unique in modern historical literature, since
there has been no comparable treatment of archaeological and
philological methodology in the light of their history. Chapter I forms an indispensable part of our work, providing the foundation both for the treatment of the subject-matter of history in
Chapter II and for the lavish use made of archaeological data in
subsequent chapters. Recognizing that history does form pat
terns, difficult though it may often be to see them clearly, we
have devoted Chapter II to an analysis of the recent develop
ment and the basic principles of the philosophy of history. Both our restatement of historical epistemology and our formu
lation of an organismic philosophy of history depend largely on the materials analyzed and interpreted in Chapter I.
The remaining four chapters are devoted to the development
of the idea of God and of the relation between God and man in the light of the historical evolution of the ancient Near East.
In Chapter III we have been forced to pay more attention to
cultural and national history than we have in subsequent chap
vii

ters, in order to indicate the nature and course of cultural
evolution clearly and effectively. In consequence, this chapter
contains the most up-to-date account of the present state of our
knowledge of prehistory and of the ancient Near East. In
Chapter IV we demonstrate the early date and originality of
Israelite monotheism; in Chapter V we show that the prophetic
movement was a reformation, not a religious revolution; in
Chapter VI we bring the book to a close with a new statement
of the historical position of our Lord. In an Epilogue we collect
the strands of our theme and recapitulate our conclusions.
In dealing with so wide a field mistakes and oversights are
inevitable. Nor can we be sure of having succeeded everywhere
in making our meaning clear. We shall, accordingly, be grate
ful to readers and reviewers who call our attention to errors and omissions and who uncover forced or inconsistent reasoning, so
that the necessary corrections can be made later.
Dr. H. M, Orlinsky has assisted me in reading proof and has
helped me to achieve clarity of expression, Drs. G. Ernest
Wright and Malcolm F. Stewart have contributed some very
useful suggestions. To my wife I owe an immense debt of
gratitude for reading the manuscript through twice and the
proof once; to her intelligence and taste are due innumerable
improvements in language and exposition. Without her aid
this book could not have appeared at all.

CHAPTER I
NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY
The light shed by the discoveries of modem archaeology on
the history of civilization is apparent to all, but the bearing of
these discoveries on the study of underlying historical processes
is not yet generally understood. Few realize, even today, what
a transformation in the matter, the scope, and the method of
history has been effected by archaeological research. Moreover,
the extraordinary progress of archaeology has been paralleled,
though not equalled, by philology, linguistics, and anthro
pology, all of which furnish data of fundamental importance
to the historian. Yet the latter is too often content to take the
results of archaeological and philological research which are
compiled for his use by the specialist, without attempting to
familiarize himself with these fields or at least to control the
methods employed by the specialist in obtaining his results. It
is, accordingly, not surprising that scholars often fail to recog
nize the fundamental change brought about in the philosophy
and especially in the epistemology of history by the use of
modern archaeological and philological methods. The phi
losophy of history, like die philosophy of science, is now
increasingly devoted to the analysis of historical data and of
the methods by which they are obtained, as a necessary prelude
to successful evaluation of, historical phenomena. The question
of method is, or should be, quite as important to the historian
as to the scientist. Only by competent analysis of methods
employed in obtaining factual data can one determine, for example, where these data stand in the hierarchy of probability,
whether they may be considered certain, probable, possible,
improbable, or impossible. Only where there is a sufficiently
broad basis of critically sifted data can inductive reasoning lead
to sound generalizations.
A. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION
Modern archaeological excavation may be said to have begun
with the first organized work at Herculaneum (1738) and
Pompeii (1748), and modern comparative archaeology may be

dated from the epoch-making researches of J. J. Winckelmann (1717-1768) in the history of Graeco-Roman art. It is interesting to note that the serious collection and interpretation of pre
Christian literature and inscriptions from the Near East began about the same time, with the remarkable expedition of the Dane, Carsten Niebuhr, in 1761-1767 and the recovery of the
principal works of Avestan literature by Anquetil-Duperron during the years 1755-1771.
The systematic surface exploration of the Near East did not begin until the turn of the century.
1 In 1798 Napoleon's scien
tific expedition began an elaborate exploration of the Nile
Valley which was promptly made available to scholars in the
stately volumes of the Description de I'Egypte (1809-13). The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 was followed by its de
cipherment through the combined efforts of Akerblad, Thomas
Young, and especially of Champollion, who published his first correct results in 1822. Mesopotamia was systematically ex
plored and described, with particular attention to its antiquities,
by Rich and Porter from 1811 to 1836, when Rich's posthumous
work appeared. In 1815 appeared the first publication of the results of Grotefend's decipherment of Persian cuneiform, which he had begun in 1802.
By the middle of the nineteenth century scientific exploration and excavation had been launched by competent scholars in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine. Richard Lepsius conducted
a well organized and very successful expedition for the purpose of recording the monuments above ground in Egypt (1842-45). Marietta began a career of thirty years of excavation in "Egypt with the discovery of the Serapeum in 1850. Paul Emile Botta commenced the excavation of Khorsabad, the ancient capital of Sargon of Assyria, in 1843 and A. H. Layard undertook the excavation of Nimrud (Calah) two years later. In Palestine
the brilliant surface explorations of Edward Robinson, whose
centenary we have just been celebrating (1938),s showed how
ancient topography should be reconstructed. We shall survey
the subsequent development of the Near Eastern field in
section B.
Work in the great field of prehistory, which was to yield some of its most remarkable discoveries in the Near East, began



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 3
to be scientifically cultivated at the same time. Jacques Boucher
de Perthes (1788-1868) began working in the Somme Valley
of France in the thirties and in 1846 he published his first
sensational account of finding human artifacts together with
the bones of extinct animals. In 1860 Eduard Lartet began the
excavation of palaeolithic caves, where he found the first clearly
defined stratigraphic sequence, enabling Gabriel de Mortillet (after 1869) to arrange palaeolithic remains in the classical
series Chellean-Mousterian-Aurignacian-Magdalenian.
Of late the greatest progress in the field of prehistory has
been made in three directions. First we may place the extension
of research by Dorothy Garrod and others to Asia and Africa,
making it possible for Oswald Menghin to write a world-history of the Stone Age (Weltgeschichte der Steinzeit, 1931). Second
we may put the development of geochronology by Count de
Geer and others, among whom Friedrich Zeuner has been most
active in the past few years.
3 Thanks to their study of glacial
and pluvial varves (laminations in sediment), as well as to the correlation of successive phases of glaciation with corresponding
phases of solar radiation, a new degree of precision in pre
historic chronology has been reached. As correlations between North European and Mediterranean river-terrace formations
and similar phenomena are being set up this chronology be
comes more and more solidly established. The results of Sandford and Arkeil in the Nile Valley since 1926 can provisionally be correlated with corresponding material in Europe, but it is
still too early to accept the theories of Leaky and others with
regard to correlations between Europe, Egypt, and South Africa.
There is so great a gap between Europe and geological deposits in China or the East Indies that no safe correlations at all can yet be made. Third we may list the sensational discoveries of
fossil human and anthropoid remains since 1925. Palestine,
with rich cranial and skeletal remains from Galilee and Carmel, has now replaced France as the focus of prehistoric research. Palaeanthropus Palestinus (sic!) exhibits just the mixture of
archaic and of neanthropic features which might be expected
from the crossing of Homo Mousteriensis (Neanderthalensis)
with Homo Sapiens, that is, of the species of man characteristic
of Middle Palaeolithic with modern man. Palestine thus ap

pears in Middle Palaeolithic as a bridge between the more advanced regions of Southern Asia and the more backward continent of Europe. The successive discoveries of Sinanthropus Pekinensis in China by Davidson Black and Teilhard de Chardin
and of Homo Soloensis in Java by von Konigswald have keyed
the interest of physical anthropologists to the highest pitch, as was vividly illustrated by the crowded sessions of the Inter
national Symposium on Early Man, held in Philadelphia in
February, 1937. 4 Further discoveries in Java, in India, and in South Africa have since reduced the gap between man and the
anthropoids to a very narrow interval, which is practically
bridged by a number of evolutionary series, the most striking of which is dentition. While our interest is concentrated on the Near East in the
present volume, a perspective in space is as necessary as one in time. It has well been emphasized by thinkers that no science can be regarded as solidly established while there is
any serious gap in recording and interpreting accessible evidence. So it is with archaeology. Until within the past few
years little had really been done outside of the classical fields of
Europe and the Near East. After the World War local and
regional archaeological work received a great impetus and there
is now scarcely a corner of the earth's land surface where some excavation has not been undertaken and where nothing is
known about past cultures. It is quite certain now that no early
civilizations worthy of the name ever arose outside of the Near East, India, China, Middle America and western South America. In 1921 the existence of a highly developed civilization in
the early Indus Valley was discovered; subsequent excavation at
Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and Chanhu-daro by Sir John Marshall and Ernest Mackay has accumulated a mass of detail and has
clarified the chronological picture, showing that the Indus culture reached its height in the first half of the third millennium B. C. and disappeared well before the end of the same mil
lennium. 6
Strictly speaking, this early civilization of India was
no less dependent on the West than was the later Aryan cul
ture, since there is close general parallelism and there are many
specific points of identity between it and the contemporary
culture of Mesopotamia and Susiana.



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 5
Since the First World War our direct archaeological knowl
edge of China before the first millennium B. C. has been carried back to the Chalcolithic by the discovery of painted-pottery cul
tures in northern China and to the second millennium B. C. by
the excavations at An-yang in Honan.6 It is still true that no
actual written document can be dated with certainty before the twelfth century B. C., but the names of kings of the Shang-Yin
Dynasty on the oracle bones from the site take us to the beginning of the dynasty, i. e., to about the middle of the second millennium. It is hardly likely that future finds will carry written records back before 2000 B. C. Comparative archae
ological investigations have shown with increasing clearness that nearly all basic elements of Chinese civilization penetrated from
the West at different periods, so that the eminent Sinologist,
C. W. Bishop, can justly call Chinese culture " a civilization by
osmosis." 7
It was formerly thought by amateurs like Rider Haggard that
the extensive remains at Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Rhodesia proved the existence of an advanced culture in South Africa
before the Christian era, but subsequent investigations by
trained archaeologists have shown that these speculations were
devoid of foundation; actually we must date the remains in question in late mediaeval and early modern times. 8
In America stratigraphic methods of excavation have begun
to be applied since the middle of the nineteen twenties and the relative chronology thus established has been translated into
absolute dates by the brilliant work of A. E. Douglass on tree
rings. The resulting method of dendrochronology has now carried the earliest Pueblo towns back to about the seventh century A. D. and the oldest datable deposits of the primitive
" Basket-makers " in New Mexico and Arizona back to about the third century A. D. To about the Christian era belong the earliest datable glyphs on Mayan monuments, though an addi
tional period of evolution must separate the oldest dated records
from the earliest sedentary communities. Not a single de
monstrable case of borrowing from the Old World can be
shown in any pre-Columbian culture of the past two millennia
in the Americas; in more remote times, but after the close of
the last glacial period at the very earliest and probably within



6 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
the past 20,000 years, there must have been wave after wave of
migration across Bering Strait. 10 The predictions of A. Hrdlicka
promise to be fulfilled by more intensive explorations and excavations in eastern Siberia and northern China, where archaic
racial stocks of Amerind appearance are already beginning to
be discovered.
Archaeological research has thus established beyond doubt
that there is no focus of civilization in the earth that can begin
to compete in antiquity and activity with the basin of the Eastern Mediterranean and the region immediately to the east of it Breasted's Fertile Crescent. Other civilizations of the Old World were all derived from this cultural centre or were
strongly influenced by it; only the New World was entirely independent. In tracing our Christian civilization of the West
to its earliest sources we are, accordingly, restricted to the
Egypto-Mesopotamian area. This historical situation provides
an unanswerable reply to the frequent complaint that disproportionate attention is paid by archaeologists to the Near East.
B. THE DISCOVERY AND INTERPRETATION OF ANCIENT NEAREASTERN WRITTEN DOCUMENTS
Logically it might be more natural to discuss unwritten docu
ments, i. e., human artifacts and uninscribed monuments, before
taking up written documents, but the study of the latter came
first in modern times, while the development of scientific
method in dealing with strata and artifacts is, in general, very recent.
1. Discovery and Interpretation: an Historical Sketch
After 1850, when the first stage of exploration, excavation,
and decipherment may be said to have closed, the progress of
research and discovery became more and more rapid as the
unparalleled value of the new historical and aesthetic treasure
became clearer. Even the World War, though it brought a
temporary set-back, was only the prelude to an extraordinary
burst of activity in the study of the past. The international situation is now bringing about a material reduction in the amount
of excavation and a corresponding shift in the personnel of



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 7
scholarship which give us leisure to take our bearings and to
consolidate the gains which we have made during the past two decades.
After the initial decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics by
Champollion there was a temporary interval caused by his death.
He was soon followed by a devoted little band of scholars, led
by men of the calibre of Lepsius and Brugsch, Birch and Good
win, de Rouge and Chabas. Lepsius
1
huge publication, Denk
maler aus Aegypten und Nubien (1849-56), provided a mass of
material for philological study and Brugsch's Hieroglyphisch
demotisches Worterbuch (1867-68, 1880-82) furnished an
elaborate collection of words and meanings, which was not
superseded for half a century. However, even in the eighties
there was still no clear idea of the grammatical structure of
Egyptian. Then came Adolf Erman, the founder of the so-called Berlin school of Egyptology, with a series of accurate and
methodical grammars and dictionaries of selected periods in the
long history of the hieroglyphic language. Employing a strictly
inductive method, i. e., taking only passages whose meaning was
reasonably clear and listing all occurrences of words, forms, and constructions in them, he built up a systematic picture of
the language which was actually used by the Egyptians at different stages of their history, without importing extraneous or
irrelevant data. Erman's first grammatical work was published
in 1880 and his last in 1933; the great dictionary of Egyptian
on which he had worked for decades began to appear in 1925
and is still in progress. The first half, containing words and meanings, was finished in 1931 and the second half, containing
passages where the words occur, is already partly published.
Thanks to Erman's brilliant pupils, K. Sethe and G. Steindorff,
followed by B, Gunn and A. Gardiner, we can now read Egyp
tian with astonishingly little uncertainty as to the sense of words
or the interpretation of passages. Even the vexed problem of
vocalization, peculiarly difficult in a script where as a rule only consonants are written, has been partially solved by Sethe and
the writer since 1923- 11 But Egyptologists have not stopped with the elucidation of the script and the language in which the Egyptians wrote: they have labored assiduously to collect and
to systematize all the knowledge that can be derived from



8 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Egyptian literature, powerfully aided by mural paintings and
artifacts. We have thus handbooks and monographs on all
phases of Egyptian civilization: religion, administrative and
economic life, arts and crafts, social and family life. The need of making this vast fund of information conveniently accessible
and of combining it into a living picture has led to the brilliant
syntheses of Erman-Ranke (1885-1923), of Wiedemann
(1920), and especially of Kees (1933).12
When we turn to the cuneiform field we find a parallel situation. After Grotefend's successful beginning the decipherment
of Old Persian was completed by Henry Rawlinson in 1846.
The Assyrian riddle proved more difficult to solve, but the efforts of Hincks, Rawlinson, and Oppert from 1846 to 1855
proved successful, though it was over twenty years before all
competent scholars were convinced that Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform had really been deciphered and could be read with essential correctness. That they were not convinced was largely
due to the lack of philological training and of scientific method on the part of most cuneiformists (with the brilliant exception
of the Irishman, Edward Hincks, the importance of whose contributions was not fully appreciated until after his death).
Rigid philological method was introduced into Assyriology, as
it had been into Egyptology, by a German school, founded by E. Schradcr and F. Delifczsch in the seventies and brought to
full development by the latter and his pupils, especially Haupt,
Zimmern, and Jensen. Delitzsch's first Assyrian grammar was
published in 1889 and his epoch-making Assyrian dictionary appeared in 1896; in 1914 he accomplished for the older non
Semitic Sumerian what he had already done for Assyrian.
After Delitzsch had placed knowledge of Assyrian on a solid
scientific basis by combining meticulous accuracy with sound
inductive method, a younger group of scholars, Ungnad, Lands
berger, and their pupils, attacked the complex problems of historical grammar and dialectology with extraordinary success. Happily, vowels as well as consonants are expressed in cunei
form script, so Landsberger and his school have been able to
raise our knowledge of the grammatical and lexical refinements of Accadian (Assyro-Babylonian) to a level above that of
Biblical Hebrew and almost on a par with that of Greek or



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 9
Latin. The Chicago Assyrian dictionary, now being prepared
by Poebel and his assistants, will provide a mine of information to workers in the cuneiform field. Owing to the wealth of
available material it is probable that very few passages in cunei
form literature will long resist the interpreter; in this respect the outlook is brighter than in Egyptian or indeed in Hebrew. Cuneiform, unlike Egyptian, was not the medium for only one
language (with a few unimportant exceptions); it was employed to write many different languages, mostly non-Semitic, in the course of its long history and wide diffusion. In fact, it
was originally the script of the Sumerians, who spoke a tongue
which has not yet been successfully related to any other langu
age, ancient or modern. For at least a thousand years Sumerian
was the sole written language of Mesopotamia (cir. 3500
2500 B. C.) and for some 2500 years more it remained the learned tongue of Western Asia, being at one time (about 1400
B. C.) taught in the schools of Syria and Asia Minor as well as in those of Mesopotamia and Susiana. Thanks to the many
bilingual texts and word-lists left us by the Accadians, it has
been possible to penetrate into the recesses of this mysterious
speech, by far the oldest dead language in history. The efforts
of Thureau-Dangin, Delitzsch, and especially of Poebel, whose Sumerische Grammatik appeared in 1923 and has already been
antiquated in important respects by his subsequent work, have
now solved all the main problems and Sumerian can be read
with general accuracy, though the obscurity of its early religious
literature provides us with plenty of work in interpretation.
Sumero-Accadian cuneiform was also used to write many
other languages: Hittite (Nasian or Nesian) , Horite (Hurrian) , Luwian, Proto-Hittite (Khattic), Balaic (all in Asia Minor), Urartian (in Armenia) , Cossaean, and Elamite (in the Zagros
and Susiana) . It was further used occasionally for a number of
known languages, such as Indo-Iranian, Canaanite (Hebrew) ,
Egyptian, Aramaic. Moreover, two independent scripts of al
phabetic nature, North Canaanite (Ugaritic) and Old Persian, both use the wedge as the primary element in forming char
acters. The cuneiform languages of Asia Minor are known to us mainly from the excavations of Winckler and Bittel at Boghaz
koy, the ancient Hittite capital, east of modern Ankara. Hittite



10 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
itself was deciphered by the Czech scholar B. Hrozny in 1915
and has been successfully interpreted by Forrer, Friedrich,
Goetze, Sommer, and others; it is now quite as well known as
Accadian was fifty years ago, owing partly to the fact that it is
Indo-European, Human is exceptionally interesting, not only because of its complex and enigmatic structure, which is equally
different from Semitic, Indo-European, and Sumerian, but also because of the curious way in which it has survived: in a letter
and in glosses in other cuneiform letters found in Egypt; in words, passages, and tablets scattered through the Hittite documents of Boghaz-koy; in tablets written in the cuneiform alphabet of Ugarit; in vocabularies and glosses in Accadian cunei
form literature; in words, constructions, and personal names in the business documents of Nuzi in eastern Mesopotamia; in fragmentary tablets excavated since 1935 at Mari, the ancient
Amorite capital on the Middle Euphrates. Complex as has
been the transmission of this material, it is rapidly yielding to
the brilliant onslaughts of Friedrich, Goetze, and Spei$er.
iy
There can be no doubt that it was the language which was
originally spoken by the Biblical Horites. 1 '4
What is true of Egyptology is also true of Assyriology, The wealth of data available in the scores of thousands of documents
which have already been published (but which do not begin to exhaust the material in our museums) has spurred two generations of scholars to the task of analysis and synthesis. Such
handbooks as Meissner's Babyhnien und Assyrian (1920-26)
and as the still incomplete Reallexikon dvr Assyriolagw
(1928 ) are supplemented by numerous recent monographs
on .special subjects such as religion and magic, law, administrative and economic organization, society and family life, arts and
crafts, etc. Owing to the much greater extent and variety of
cuneiform sources, a great deal more is known about many
aspects of Mesopotamia!! life than is true of Eirypt, though cor
respondingly less is known about features of daily life which
arc now very well known in Egypt, thanks to mural paintings and the dryness of its soil.
Turning now from cuneiform to Semitic alphabetical litera
ture, we find ourselves immeasurably poorer. Yet there are now
thousands of inscriptions, nearly all on stone, written in



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 11
Aramaic, in various dialects of Canaanite (Hebrew) , in South
Arabic and in North Arabic; there is also an immensely valu
able little corpus of clay tablets written in a Canaanite dialect and a cuneiform alphabet. The North-Semitic (Phoenician)
alphabet was finally deciphered by W. Gesenius, whose great
work on the subject appeared in 1837, and the South-Semitic
(Minaeo-Sabaean) alphabet yielded its secrets almost simultaneously to Gesenius and to E. Rodiger in 1841. The earliest inscriptions in Phoenician or Aramaic known to Gesenius (aside
from a few seals) belonged to the fifth century B. C; one by
one older inscriptions have since been found, pushing the date
back to the ninth century (Mesha Stone, found in 1868),
eleventh or twelfth century (sarcophagus of Ahiram of Byblus. 1923), sixteenth or seventeenth (miscellaneous finds in Palestine since 1929 ).
15 A still earlier stage of the North-Semitic alphabet, which was the direct progenitor of our own, seems to
be represented by the proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, first discovered by Petrie in 1905 and partially deciphered by Gardiner in 1916:
their interpretation is handicapped by the scantiness of the material and none of the proposed decipherments can be con
sidered as certain. 10 The recent discovery of the Ostraca of
Samaria (published since 1924) 17 and the Lachish Letters
(1935) ls has been of very great value for biblical studies. The South-Arabic and North-Arabic inscriptions are less important, but they still form a unique body of material for the study of
the pre-Islamic culture of Arabia and they frequently shed
valuable light on the Old Testament. The foremost authorities
on the two groups of proto-Arabic texts are, respectively, N. Rhodokanakis and F. V. Winnett. In spite of measureless
exaggeration of the antiquity of the earliest South-Arabic in
scriptions by Glaser and Hommel, it is now clear that none of them antedates the seventh or eighth century B.C., though
earlier ones will probably be found in future. The earliest
North-Arabic inscriptions are nearly, if not quite, as old, as has
just been demonstrated by Winnett. 1"
During the past ten years a most important and entirely
unexpected new script and literature have been discovered,
deciphered, and made accessible. This is the North-Canaanite
literature in a previously unknown cuneiform alphabet, which



12 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
has come to light in C F. A. Schaeffer's excavations at Ras
esh-Shamrah, ancient Ugarit on the coast of northern Syria.
The first documents were discovered in 1929 and published the
following year. Almost immediately deciphered by H. Bauer
and E. Dhorme, they have proved to be written in two languages, one a very archaic Canaanite dialect akin to pre-Mosaic
Hebrew and the other a Hurrian dialect (see above) . In eleven
campaigns from 1929 to 1939 several hundred tablets and fragments in this script have been unearthed; a number of them belong to unusually large tablets with three or four columns on
each side, containing originally several hundred lines. Nearly
all the new alphabetic documents, which date mainly from the fifteenth century B. C, are of religious character and most of
them belong to three mythological epics, which treat of the events connected with the death and resurrection of Baal, with
the marriage of the demigod Keret, and with another demigod
Daniel (Dan'el). The editor of these priceless documents, Ch.
Virollcaud, has admirably commenced the task of interpreting
this new material and many other scholars, among whom may be mentioned in particular R. Dussaud, H. L. Ginsberg, J. A. Montgomery and Z. S. Harris, A. Goetze, C. H. Gordon, and
the writer, have contributed to its elucidation.20 There is still
much that is obscure and the historical-geographical views of Virolleiiucl have not been accepted by most other scholars,- 1 but owing to the wealth of material already available and to the
resemblance of the language to Hebrew, most of the new texts can be translated with certainty or with reasonable confidence. In the present volume great care will be exercised not to draw on uncertain translations for evidence.
In addition to Egyptian hieroglyphics, Accadian and other cuneiform scripts, North-Semitic and South-Semitic alphabets, many other scripts have been recently discovered in the basin of
the eastern Mediterranean. Here we shall list only the most
important, in order to give some idea of the epigraphic riches
hein# deciphered and still to be deciphered. First we may men
tion the Hittite "
hieroglyphs," in which are written hundreds
of inscriptions from Syria and Asia Minor, apparently all dating
from between 1 500 and 500 B. C. and mostly from the Iron Age, between 1200 and 700 B.C. First recognized and pro



1NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 13
visionally identified as "Hittite" in the seventies of the past
century, decipherment was attempted by A. H. Sayce and P.
Jensen, followed unsuccessfully by many others. Finally, in
1928, a new phase was opened by P. Meriggi, followed closely
by E. Forrer, I. Gelb, H. Bossert, and especially by B. Hrozny; 22
scores of hieroglyphiform characters in this script can be cer
tainly or plausibly read and the language has been associated to the satisfaction of specialists with the two proto-Indo
European languages of Asia Minor already known, Hittite and Luwian. It must be confessed that there is still a great deal
to be done before philologically adequate translations of the
inscriptions can be given. Very similar in origin, as well as
apparently in structure, is the Aegean hieroglyphic script of the early second millennium, which developed about the middle of the millennium into two linear derivatives, one of which is known from Bronze-Age Crete, Cyprus, and the Greek mainland. First discovered by (Sir) Arthur Evans in the nineties of
the past century, the Cretan script is best illustrated by some 1600 clay tablets containing texts in the latest of its three
phases, linear B, belonging to the fifteenth century B. C. Nearly forty years after this great find at Cnossus an additional one of
six hundred tablets was made by Blegen at Nestor's ancient
capital of Pylus in southwestern Greece (1939).2S Many
efforts have been made to decipher this script, which seems to
have been used to write several languages, including Mycenaean Greek, but few generally accepted results have been obtained
so far. When all the documents from Cnossus and Pylus have
been published it will hardly take long to decipher them.24 That there were still other hieroglyphiform syllabaries in use in the coastlands of the northeastern Mediterranean in the Bronze Age is indicated by such chance finds as the Phaestus Disk.
We have not begun to exhaust the list of undeciphered and
partly deciphered scripts now known to have existed in the Near
East in antiquity. The point of diminishing returns has not
been reached and two new scripts seem to replace every script
that is successfully interpreted. One of the latest and most
interesting is the hieroglyphiform syllabary used at Byblus in
Phoenicia toward the end of the third millennium B. C. One
fragment of stone was published by the discoverer, M. Dunand,



14 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
in 1930 and a number of similar texts on copper were described
by him at the International Congress of Orientalists in Rome
(1935).- 5 Since this script appears to have been used to write
a very early form of Canaanite (Hebrew) antedating the
Patriarchal Age, we look forward eagerly to its decipherment.
2. Linguistic and Philological Method in the Interpretation of Written Documents.
The fundamental significance of sound method in decipher
ment and interpretation has been emphasized repeatedly in the preceding section. In conformity with our principle of stressing
methodology, we shall now give a succinct analysis of linguistic
and philological method in the interpretation of written docu
ments. Following recent usage we define "
linguistic
" as relat
ing to the scientific aspects of language as such, i. e., to the
form, structure, vocabulary, and comparative treatment of indi
vidual languages. Similarly we define "
philological
" as re
lating to the scientific study of documents, written or orally transmitted. This point must be stressed, since the usage of the
nineteenth century substituted "
philological
" for what we now
prefer to call "
linguistic/* owing to the fact that the technical
and comparative study of language had replaced the investiga
tion of documents as the primary interest of philologians. We
now revert to the eighteenth-century understanding of "
philology
" and apply the term "
linguistics" to the subsequently
developed technical part of the field. Of course a sharp distinc
tion is not always possible, especially when we deal with the
grammatical and lexicographical exegesis of a text.
The primary function of the linguist is to describe the phe
nomena of a given language or dialect as exactly and as com
prehensively as possible. The utmost precision is here necessary
in order to escape error in establishing the phonetic form of an oral or written document and in analyzing its grammatical structure. Of course, phonetic form in written documents is de
pendent on the accuracy and consistency of the orthography and
may be quite a different thing from the original phonemic
pattern of the document as read aloud. The analysis of the
structure of a language follows the same logical principles
whether the language is well known or is new, whether it is



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 15
found in ancient documents or is taken down from the mouths of living men. The analysis must always follow the same
logical sequence: induction, deduction, analogical reasoning.
Since all language is rigidly bound by law which operates as
effectively when it originates in custom and imitation as when it
arises from anatomical, physiological, or other, psychological,
sources linguistic phenomena are capable of as scientific treat
ment as are any data of biological origin. The methodological triad, observation, experiment, induction, on which natural
science is based, operates in a corresponding way in linguistics.
We include the word "
experiment
"
advisedly, since the linguist
who studies a new language as spoken by living men must con
stantly test and correct his observations and his tentative hy
potheses by devising suitable procedure for making such tests.
The investigator of ancient languages employs the same logical
method, though in a more restricted way, when he tests his
observations and inductions by applying them to new or previously excluded written documents. Just as the linguistic
anthropologist or the dialectologist restricts himself carefully to a given dialect or group of speakers, in order to avert con
fusion, so the up-to-date specialist in ancient languages is scrupulously careful to limit himself as far as feasible to a given
geographical dialect or historical phase of a language. Thus the
Assyriologist who wishes to specialize in Accadian grammar
distinguishes sharply between such phases as the following:
Old Accadian (cir. 25th-22nd century B. C), Old Babylonian
(cir. 20th-17th century B.C.), Middle Babylonian (cir. 15thllth century B.C.), Neo-Babylonian (cir. 9th-5th century
B. C.) , Old Assyrian, Middle Assyrian, Neo-Assyrian, the Larsa
dialect, the dialect of Mari, the dialect of Nuzi, etc. Sometimes different bodies of literature are written in different
dialects, as in the case of the Accadian texts of the hymnal-epic class, which belong to the end of the third millennium and
the beginning of the second. The prologue of the Code of
Hammurabi (18th century B. C.) is composed in a more archaic
and literary language than is the corpus of laws which follows it.
Since there is widespread vagueness as to the applicability of linguistic methods to the study of ancient historical sources
and data, we shall list a few fields where such application is



16 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
justifiable. Language may be used with caution to prove an original physical association between different groups of men.
Of course, it is no longer necessary to emphasize the fact that a
common linguistic inheritance does not necessarily carry with
it a common racial origin, since language may be borrowed whereas physical inheritance cannot. But for the historian it is
even more important to demonstrate linguistic relationship than it is to establish racial kinship, since the former has an intimate
bearing on past cultural association while the latter may be
quite devoid of concrete historical meaning (unless one is
primarily interested in prehistory) . The most important result of comparative linguistic science is the demonstration (now over
a century old) that the various branches of the Indo-European
family speak closely related languages which can all be traced
back to a common ancestral tongue; linguistic methods make it possible to reconstruct the most essential phonetic and morpho
logical features of the latter. It is increasingly probable that, as
shown by Forrer and especially by Sturtevant, Proto-IndoEuropean is a sister or aunt, not the mother of the newly
deciphered tongues of Asia Minor such as Hittite and Luwian. In the past few decades it has become certain that there is a similar genetic relationship between the Semitic tongues of Asia
(Canaanite-Hebrew, Aramaic, Accadian, Arabic) and the Hamitic of North Africa, with Egyptian taking an intermediate
position between them.26 Here, however, the time which elapsed between the original diffusion of Hamito-Semitic peoples and the earliest available documents in the individual
languages is much greater than in the case of Indo-European, so the difficulty of formulating the laws governing phonetic change as well as of reconstructing grammatical evolution is cor
respondingly greater. It must be said, most emphatically, that
most efforts to prove linguistic relationship in opposition to the
views of competent specialists are doomed to failure. In few
fields of learning has more nonsense been perpetrated by ama
teurs, i. e., by enthusiasts who are unwilling to submit to the
painfully rigid discipline of linguistic method.
Since observation and induction prove that each dialect and
each phase of linguistic history has its own phonetic and other
laws, which often overlap but seldom permit exceptions (them



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 17
selves due to the operation of conflicting laws) inside of each
dialect or phase, the greatest care is needed in applying linguistic
law to the solution of specific philological or historical questions. E. g., in deciding whether a given form of a Canaanite
name or word can be identified with a foreign name or word
transcribed into Egyptian, we must determine the exact time of the document or documents in which the transcription is found,
we must fix, if possible, the phonetic form which the given
Canaanite word would have at that time or earlier, and must then see whether the resulting equations of Canaanite phonemes
with Egyptian signs are in accordance with inductively estab
lished relationships of the same age and type. The procedure
sounds complex and it must be rigorous. What results can be achieved may be illustrated by the following chain of recent
investigations and discoveries. In 1923 K. Sethe and the writer
independently established the phonetic laws governing the principal changes in the Egyptian vowel-system from Proto
Egyptian to Coptic, over a period of at least 4000 years.27 This
was accomplished mainly by a rigorous confrontation of the
inner Egyptian principles of vocalism as inductively worked out by Steindorff and Sethe a quarter century before with cuneiform
transcriptions of Egyptian names and words, going back to
about 1400 B. C. Two years later a cuneiform vocabulary of
Egyptian words from the 14th century B. C. was published and the vocalic theories in question were confirmed throughout,
as far as the new evidence went. In 1934 the writer published a reconstruction of the vocalic system which was employed by
the Egyptians of the New Empire for writing foreign names
and words. In this work much use was made of reconstructed forms of Canaanite words and names, according to the evidence
of comparative linguistics, checked by transcriptions into cunei
form in the Amarna Tablets and elsewhere. The method was criticized by scholars who were not linguists, but discoveries
since 1934, especially from more intensive study of Ugaritic, have confirmed it most strikingly.
28
Formerly the main special use of linguistic method was in
determining the etymology and hence the primary meaning of a
given word. Biblical handbooks are cluttered with false ety
mologies, as well as with correct etymologies from which er



18 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
roneous or undemonstrable deductions have been made. Actu
ally, no competent lexicographer in any language fixes the
precise meaning of a word by its etymology but rather by
collecting as many passages where the word occurs as possible or practicable and by listing all meanings and shades of meaning
in them. Words change their meaning through use to such
an extent that the etymological method of fixing significance is only employed as a last resort, where other evidence is inade
quate. Wherever possible the combinatory method (i. e., the
collection .and comparison of all passages where a word occurs)
has replaced the etymological one in decipherment and interpretation, at least among competent scholars.
A few illustrations of the importance of linguistic methodology for the biblical scholar will be more effective than further
description. Many historians have thoughtlessly identified Zerah (Zrh] the Cushite (II Chron. 14: 9) with the Bubastite
pharaoh Osorkon I.28 If, however, we examine all certain cases
of transcription from Egyptian into Hebrew in the same general age and fix the approximate pronunciation of the consonants in question in both languages at that time, the identification is at
once seen to be absurd as it really is historically. The Hebrew
word shir,
"
song, poem," was long ago connected etymologically with Arabic sh??9 "poem," though the loss of the
consonant 'ayin could not be explained. Now we know that
Hebrew shir must be traced back through Canaanite to Old
Babylonian shwum, sherum (with the nominative ending um),
itself derived from parent Semitic sh'frum. Moreover, this
derivation fits perfectly into the picture which we now have of the passage of cultural loan-words from Accadian to Canaanite,
and the date of the borrowing may be fixed by comparative
linguistic methods to before the sixteenth century B. C. 30 Again,
Old Testament scholars have been inclined to make much of
the fact that kahin, the Arabic cognate of Hebrew kohen,
"
priest," means "
soothsayer, diviner." Unfortunately, however, the word is isolated in Arabic and may, therefore, like thousands of other cultural words in that language, be considered equally well as a loan-word from older Canaanite kahin
or from Aramaic kahna, both meaning "
priest"; should this
be true we would have an indication of specialization in func



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 19
tion among the Arabs and not of a supposed magical back
ground of the Israelite priesthood.31 Such examples can easily
be multiplied. In studying written documents from the ancient Near East
there are four main stages: decipherment of the script, linguistic interpretation, philological analysis, and historical interpretation. Success in decipherment requires great ingenuity and
usually demands erudition and industry. Grotefend, Bauer, and Dhorme, all three o which were cipher experts, illustrate
the necessity of ingenuity; Champollion and Hrozny illustrate the value of erudition. Many decipherers, like Grotefend, have been wholly unable to continue their work beyond the first
stages, because of inadequate linguistic preparation. The lingu
istic interpretation of an inscription may follow strictly combinatory methods, as best illustrated by recent work in Egyptian and Sumerian. or it may avail itself of the assistance given by
cognate languages, as in the decipherment of Assyrian and
Ugaritic. Here, however, rigorous linguistic training is essential if the translation is not to descend to the level of guess-work, as is unhappily illustrated by many of the translations of Ugaritic texts offered by free-lances in England and America. Intuition
is a very valuable heuristic aid when it is based on extended
practice and knowledge, but even then it must be disregarded
unless it can be otherwise controlled. The task of interpretation
is, however, not finished when a document has been correctly
translated. After the linguist has done all that he can, die philologist (in the narrow sense) must continue where he has left off and must determine the class to which the document
belongs, investigate its verse-form or literary category, establish the text by methods of textual (" lower ") criticism where
it is corrupt, fix its date and authorship if possible, and draw conclusions which can be utilized directly by the historian.
Finally, the historian attacks the documentary material, analy
zing it for the purpose of reconstructing some phase of human history: political, social, religious, aesthetic, economic, legal, etc. It goes without saying that there is seldom such narrow specialization in the persons of interested scholars: the scholar is often
decipherer, linguist, philologist, or philologist and historian;
in rare instances he may be all four. As in all other fields of



20 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
scholarship and science, the two most important essentials for success are precision and critical judgment. Without the strictest
precision that is attainable a scholar's work may produce and
transmit errors, often after they have been disproved by others; without severe critical method a scholar fails to avail himself of the aid which may be derived from the accumulated experience
of his guild.
C. THE DISCOVERY AND INTERPRETATION OF UNWRITTEN DOCUMENTS FROM THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST
Until very recently there was a general tendency on the part of ancient historians and biblical scholars to neglect or even to
despise the unwritten objects unearthed by archaeologists in
increasing profusion. Sensational discoveries in prehistoric Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Aegean, and Palestine, together with the increasing interest taken by natural scientists in archaeology
when divorced from written documents, have changed the pre
vailing attitude. It is now becoming hard to find a philologist
who denies the value of anepigraphic archaeology (the science of unwritten documents) , and the reverse has become fashion
able in certain circles with equally unfortunate results. To
the real student of antiquity neither discipline is any longer adequate in itself; it is only by the union of philology with
archaeology that we can make the ancient world live.
1. Discovery and Methodology
The discovery of the value of pottery, undecorated as well
as painted, for chronological purposes lies at the foundation of modern archaeology. It is true that any other class of objects can also be employed for this purpose, but since whole vases and broken sherds outnumber all other artifacts in ancient Near
Eastern sites a hundred to one, since pottery styles changed as
remorselessly as all other fashions, and since pottery was too breakable and once broken too unimportant to be preserved, it
is incomparably the most useful class of object for dating.82
The discovery of the chronological value of painted pottery was
made in the nineteenth century by classical archaeologists, whose work culminated in the brilliant synthesis of Furtwangler



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 21
(mainly in the eighties of the century). But the latter was
primarily an historian of art, hence common, undecorated wares failed completely to interest him. It was reserved for a young
Egyptian archaeologist, (Sir) Flinders Petrie, to discover that unpainted pottery might be just as good an instrument for
dating as was painted, if the same attention were paid to it.
This fact grew on him during his work in Egypt in the eighties
of the past century, especially after working at Naucratis in
1885, but he failed to understand its full implications until he
dug for six weeks on the scarp of a Palestinian mound, Tell
el-Hesi (1890) . Here he found over sixty feet of superimposed
debris of occupation, covering (as we now know) more than
two thousand years of history. This debris was, he found, clearly divided into strata, each characterized by its own types
of pottery, though there was not, of course, strict correlation between periods of occupation and ceramic phases. Several
strata he was able to synchronize with Egyptian dynasties, thanks to imported Syro-Palestinian pottery previously discovered in datable Egyptian tombs. In certain cases he was thus able to secure a nearly correct absolute chronology as well as an accurate relative chronology. That his absolute chronology
was not correct throughout was due to the still primitive state of
Egyptian archaeology itself.
Tell el-Hesi was not actually the first true mound, with
stratified deposits of successive occupation, to be excavated; that honor falls to Hissarlik, ancient Troy in northwestern Asia Minor, where Heinrich Schliemann began to dig in 1870. But
Schliemann remained a brilliant amateur, and though he recognized the implications of his work he was unable to develop a
method of excavating or of dating the layers of a mound.
Even the gifted Dorpfeld, who joined him at Troy in 1882 and
resumed work there in 1892, after Sdiliemann's death, neglected
pottery, though he developed a superior technique for accurate
planning and recording of superimposed constructional remains.
To Petrie and Dorpfeld we owe the elements of modern archae
ological method in the Near East. Petrie's discovery of the
importance of pottery for stratigraphy and chronology was
unhappily not accepted by Dorpfeld, who even failed to keep
pace with Furtwangler and became involved in an unfortunate



22 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
controversy with him. Dorpfeld has never given up his errone
ous point of view about ceramic chronology, which still mars the
pages of his Alt-Olympia (1935). Happily, all other Aegean
archaeologists now follow the methods introduced by Petrie and
employ pottery as the basis for their chronology of this region before the sixth century B. C. Eleven years after his work at Tell el-Hesi, Petrie published
an equally important ceramic discovery in his Diospolis Parva
(1901). This discovery was that of the principle of sequence
dating. Seven years previously he had begun to find Egyptian remains antedating the Pyramid Age, which up to that time had
marked the dawn of Egyptian monumental history. He and
others attacked the new field of prehistoric archaeology with great enthusiasm and success, finding numerous and extensive cemeteries containing thousands of tombs and burials, most of
which had been provided with vases of food when the original
interments were made. Some of the tombs were dated to the First Dynasty by written objects found in them. The rest were mute and appeared at first sight quite undatable. But Petrie had
already set up the principle that pottery could be used for
chronological purposes and he was also familiar with the
tendency of any kind of object to change its form after repeated imitation, i. e., after one form had been copied and the copy
had been copied in its turn a sufficient number of times. One
type, a large cylindrical jar with a wavy ledge-handle, showed a great many variations in the form of the handle, variations
which could be arranged in an evolutionary series. Which end of the series came first, whether the wavy handle had developed
from a rudimentary form or had been gradually reduced to a
vestigial form, might have been hard to decide, but luckily one end the vestigial one terminated in dated tombs of the First Dynasty, so the other end had to begin in a more remote pre
dynastic phase. By applying the same method to other series
of pottery types which he found with the wavy-handled jars he was not only able to corroborate his results but also to
prolong his sequence backward to a period long preceding the
first appearance of the jars in question. At first Petrie's se
quence-dating aroused the same skepticism and hostility that his
earlier use of pottery for dating had stirred up, but subsequent



HORIZONS IN HISTORY 23
discoveries have confirmed his method and his conclusions so
often and so brilliantly that all competent archaeologists now
take them for granted. It must, however, be remembered that
sequence-dating is purely typological and often requires confirmation by stratigraphy before its results can be considered
absolutely certain. The most important contributions made since Petrie's original discoveries in the field of ceramic chronology have been tech
nical and comparative. Petrie's technique in recording pottery
was rough and ready; his drawings were generally only in out
line and freehand; photography was seldom employed; descrip
tions were sketchy and wholly inadequate from our present
point of view. Important details of form were neglected and only the scantiest information was given with regard to paste,
finish, decoration, etc. G. A. Reisner and his pupils, especially
C. S. Fisher, have introduced incomparably more precise
methods. Virtually all competent excavators in the Near East
now devote much, often most of their time to excavating,
assembling, recording, classifying, and reproducing their
pottery. The latest important forward step in dealing with
pottery comes from the archaeological laboratories of New
Mexico; it consists in minute petrographical analysis of the
paste (composition) of pottery, with the aid of microphoto
graphs and of chemical analyses. In this way significant details which escaped previous students can be detected and valuable
conclusions for provenience and dating can be drawn.33
All other classes of objects made by human hand can now be treated in a comparable way, so that they may also be utilized
for the purpose of chronology and the history of culture.
Thanks to extreme care in clearing and describing the locus of objects (i. e., the place in which and the level at which they are
found), as well as in describing and analyzing their composi
tion, etc., their function and mode of manufacture may be
reconstructed. Art objects are among the most valuable both
for chronology and for the history of civilization, since so
much attention has recently been paid to questions of technique and motif connected with them, and since they usually represent the greatest technical and aesthetic effort of ancient cul
tures. However, since such objects were often prized as heir



24 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
looms or were stored in temples and palaces for generations
or even centuries, care must be taken in utilizing them for
chronological purposes.
The systematic archaeologist is thus forced to employ two divergent principles at almost every step in his work: stratigraphy, or the study of the relation of objects to the layers or deposits in which they are found and the relation of these
deposits to one another; typology, or the classification of objects according to types, following taxonomic methods, and the comparison of objects belonging to a type with one another, in order to determine chronological, geographical, and technical relation
ships. The principle of stratigraphy involves induction and experiment; that of typology is rather based on deduction and
classification. The complementary character of the two princi
ples in archaeology is somewhat like that of experiment and mathematical theory in physics. At an early stage of archae
ological research in any given country, all the advantage is with
the stratigrapher. At a later stage the typologist finds more and more to do and the trained typologist eventually acquires an advantage over the mechanical stratigrapher, except in dealing with undisturbed deposits. In the Aegean, for instance, typology has recently scored some signal victories over a stratigraphy
which had become more refined than the technique of observation and recording warranted.
Recapitulating what we have said about the development
of archaeological method, we must stress the fact that the strati
graphic method was first applied to archaeology in the Near East, but not until more than half a century after the beginning
of archaeological excavation. In some circles it was not properly employed until within the past decade. Under these circum
stances such progress as may be recorded was mainly typological
and historical. Occasional control was furnished by the dis
covery of uninscribed objects in close conjunction with inscribed
ones of known date, whether absolute or relative. Toward the
end of the 19th century came the discovery that unpainted
pottery could be used for dating and that the stratigraphic possi
bilities of ancient mounds were almost unlimited. Stratigraphy
and typology then developed apace. In Egypt, where nearly all
city mounds are still occupied by modern settlements and where



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 25
tombs and temples attract almost all excavators, stratigraphy
has only begun to be exploited in the past decade or so, whereas
typology can be employed to great advantage because of the
extraordinary number o intact, accurately datable tombs.
Stratigraphy will always labor under a hopeless disadvantage in the Nile Valley, especially in the Delta, because the steady rise o the subterranean water level has flooded almost all early
strata, often leaving nothing of pre-Ptolemaic date accessible to
the spade without prohibitive expense. In southwestern Asia,
on the other hand, a large proportion of the ancient mounds,
especially in Babylonia, are now deserted; the change of the
courses of Tigris and Euphrates in late pre-Christian times has
left once fertile and densely peopled districts an arid wilderness,
while other, formerly uninhabited tracts are now cultivated and
are dotted with towns and villages. Stratigraphy flourishes most
today in dealing with places and times where little intelligible writing is found, such as Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, or the
earlier phases of sedentary life in Mesopotamia and the Aegean.
The character and the direct value for history of what we
have called anepigraphic archaeology may be illustrated by a
brief sketch of its achievements in two directions: pre
Hellenistic Palestine, prehistoric Egypt and Mesopotamia.
As has already been emphasized, the history of modern archaeological research in Palestine goes back to Petrie's six weeks at Tell el-Hesi in 1890. In the following twenty years
the British Palestine Exploration Fund organized excavations
at some eight Palestinian sites, including especially five years
of work at Gezer (between 1902 and 1909), directed by R. A.
S. Macalister. The Germans and Austrians also dug at Taanach,
Megiddo, and Jericho from 1901 to 1909 and an elaborately
organized American expedition from Harvard University worked at Samaria from 1908 to 1910, under the admirable direction of G. A. Reisner. In spite of the quantity of objects
and of data brought to light and made accessible to scholars
(by 1913 virtually all pre-War excavations had been published),
the results were disappointing and we have not yet entirely recovered from the disillusionment which their publication
caused in philological and historical circles. This reaction was
due not only to the extremely small proportion of written docu



26 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
ments found by Palestinian excavators, but perhaps mainly to
the vague and conflicting character of their conclusions. As a result of the first decade of work in Palestine, though few
interesting objects and buildings had been found, Bliss had set
up a roughly blocked out but substantially correct chronology
going back to the early second millennium B. C. At Gezer, however, Macalister tried to arrange his chronology so as to cover a hiatus of several centuries (cir. 9th-6th centuries) in
the history of the city and consequently reduced most of his dates between 1200 and 300 B. C. by several centuries. This
erroneous telescoping of chronology was carried much farther
by the Germans, misled by similar gaps at Jericho and by premature historical interpretation of their finds; in their case the error amounted at one point to about eight hundred years
(cir. 1600-800 B. C.).84 What a chaos ensued may be seen by
examination of Handcock's systematic attempt at synthesis,
Archaeology of the Holy Land (1916) , where remains from the
Bronze Age are mixed with others from the Iron Age, where
" Israelite "
objects are generally Canaanite, where "post
exilic " remains are likely to be pre-exilic, and where " cultural
phases
" are invariably crazy quilts composed of pieces of
heterogeneous origin. In 1920 the British administration in Palestine established
a department of antiquities headed by a competent archaeologist,
John Garstang, and did everything possible to encourage ex
cavators. In 1921 the University of Pennsylvania Museum
began its important work at Beth-shan; in 1922 the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem undertook the first
in a long series of excavations, some of which were very im
portant; in 1925 the University of Chicago began work at the great site of Megiddo; in 1926 and 1928 the excavations at
Tell en-Nasbeh and Beth-shemesh, respectively, were launched; in 1927 the British School of Archaeology in Egypt (directed
by Sir Flinders Petrie) commenced a series of excavations in the extreme south; in 1929 Garstang resumed the excavation of Jericho which had been begun by the Germans before the War;
in 1930 the excavation of Teleilat el-Ghassul near Jericho was undertaken by the Pontifical Biblical Institute; in 1931 Harvard
University resumed work at Samaria; in 1932 the Lachish expe



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 27
dition was launched; in 1933 Mme. Marquet-Krause undertook
the excavation of Ai. This bald list mentions only the outstanding excavations in Palestinian mounds without attempting to
exhaust the list. Thanks to this unprecedented concentration
of activity in so small a country, we now have a remarkably
precise and detailed knowledge of the chronology and character of successive periods of culture in Palestine back to neolithic times. By 1929 the data amassed before the First World War had been correlated with subsequent discoveries and the broad outlines of the history of civilization were clear back to the 17th
century B. C, with no disagreement on chronology worth mentioning. In the past ten years innumerable details have been filled in and a series of remarkable undertakings has carried
our knowledge back to the beginnings of sedentary occupation in the Neolithic Age, thus bridging the gap between archaeology
in the narrow sense and prehistory. Moreover, the main stream of Palestinian culture has been correlated with that of Egypt and Mesopotamia back to the end of the fourth millennium, thus synchronizing the course of history in the two foci of culture in the Near East. Incidentally, the recent expansion of
archaeological activity in Syria, with important undertakings at Byblus, Ugarit, Hamath, Man, Rihaniyeh, Alalakh, etc., has not only brought quantities of written documents and art
objects to light; it has also yielded a mass of stratigraphical evidence for the chronology of civilization in early Syria. Since there are so many close parallels and virtual identities between the cultures of Palestine and Syria in any one period, the archaeology of the two lands is intimately interrelated.
The second most important field annexed by anepigraphic
archaeology is that of prehistoric Egypt and Mesopotamia.35
This we may call one field because of the chronological parallel
ism of its two parts and the close similarity in their basic culture
at any early period. The recovery of protodynastic and pre
dynastic Egypt began in 1895 with the work of Amelineau, de
Morgan, and Petrie in the oldest cemeteries, among which were
found the tombs of the kings of the First Dynasty. In 1901
Petrie formulated his system of "
sequence-dating
"
(see above) , carrying back predynastic culture to S. D. 30; since 1924 a
whole series of still earlier chalcolithic and neolithic cultures



28 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
has been discovered, beginning with the Badarian and going
back to the earliest sedentary culture now known to have existed
in Egypt, the Faiyumian which, to judge from Palestinian
parallels, is very early Neolithic. In Mesopotamia and Susiana
the recovery of prehistoric sedentary cultures really began at
Susa about 1898, soon after de Morgan had started excavating
the great mound of the acropolis. Until de Morgan published
his results in 1912 the world of scholars had no idea of the beauty of the pottery nor of the vast antiquity of this new
culture. In Mesopotamia itself the culture was first discovered
by Baron von Oppenheim at Tell Halaf, ancient Gozan in the extreme north, in 1911-13, but the significance of his finds did
not become evident until after the First World War. In 1918
and 1919 Thompson and Hall discovered prehistoric painted
pottery at two sites in southern Babylonia, and in 1928 the
German excavators at Erech (Warka) in Babylonia secured the first stratigraphic evidence for the historical position of
the painted-pottery cultures. The past decade has witnessed
extraordinary activity in the study of Mesopotamian prehistory
and the sequence of early cultures has now been worked out in
detail, thanks particularly to the work of Speiser and Mallowan
in the north. The last five years have shown that northern
Syria and Cilicia passed through closely parallel phases of Neo
lithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze. 36 Nowhere in the Near East outside of Palestine, however, has the gap between Palaeo
lithic and Neolithic been bridged.

2. The Historical Interpretation of Archaeological Data
It is advisable to enter into more detail in treating the historical exploitation of unwritten documents than in discussing the use of written documents by historians, since methods and
limitations are much less generally understood in the former case. It is true that interest in ancient architecture and art is
nearly as old as that in literature, but it is equally true that the critical study of the latter goes back to Bentley and Person in
the late seventeenth century and was notably advanced by men
like Friedrich Wolf and J. G. Eichhorn at the end of the eight
eenth, whereas the corresponding stages in treating anepigraphical materials can hardly be said to have begun until the



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 29
middle and the last quarter of the nineteenth century, respec
tively. Limitations of space prevent our dealing as fully with
this topic as we should like; we shall restrict ourselves to two
outstanding examples of the successful historical analysis of
anepigraphic archaeological subjects, followed by brief discussions of the bearing of archaeology in the narrow sense on
demography, sociology, race, civilization, and religion. In 1919 the curator of the Egyptian section of the Berlin
museums, Heinrich Schafer, published an epoch-making book
entitled Von agyptischer Kunst (" Of Egyptian Art ") . In the
first two editions of this work he restricted himself to the
analysis of line-drawing, but in the third (1930) he also in
cluded sculpture. As a result of an incisive examination of
the ways in which Egyptian artists reproduced objects and land
scapes in drawing and painting, Schafer was able to go far beyond the point reached by E. Lowy and J. Lange in 1891-92,
when they first described the law of frontality and symmetry
in early Greek sculpture. Starting with the accepted distinction
between conceptual and perceptual treatment of visual images
he showed with a wealth of illustration from Egyptian art as
well as from the drawings of children and savages, how domi
nant conceptual art was in Egypt and other lands in pre-Greek
times. Analysis of various types of conceptual reproduction of images yielded important historical, aesthetic, and interpretative criteria. Turning to sculpture he showed that it developed
directly from line art through the simple device of drawing five aspects of an object on five sides of a block of stone which was
to be carved into sculpture. From this principle, itself the result of Egyptian efforts to perpetuate accepted canons of form
and proportion, was inevitably derived a strict law of frontality, later borrowed and modified by the Greeks. Schafer's principles have since been applied to other ancient art and have profoundly influenced the whole approach of historians of art. Though
conceptual art tends to sprout afresh in every period of artistic
change, especially in the past half-century, it was definitively
replaced in Greece by perceptual art and perspective during the
age of Pericles, and gradually penetrated even into China about
the middle of the first millennium A. D. An illustration of inadmissible deduction is provided by W. Wolfs attempt



30 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
(1935) to explain Egyptian principles of line-drawing by the
pre-individualistic form of Egyptian society and its strong group
consciousness.57 That the two principles were roughly contemporary cannot be denied but that they were not concomitant nor interdependent is shown by the recent recrudescence of conceptual art in one of the most individualistic periods and in
some of the most individualistic circles in history.
Our second illustration lies in the field of architecture. Here
recent archaeologists and historians of architecture, especially
W. Andrae (Das Gotteshaus, 1930) andR. Engelbach (Ancient
Egyptian Masonry, 1930) 38 have traced the origin, development,
and modifications of the art of building in the Near East so
clearly and adequately as to revolutionize all historical approach
to this field. Their treatment may not be quite so psychologically
satisfying as Schafer's analysis of Egyptian art, but it is of
considerably more direct value to the historian. Three underlying principles have been recovered by analysis of the factual
material; they apply to all objects of human manufacture but are peculiarly evident in architecture. These principles (which
must be given here in our own formulation) may be stated as
follows: 1. Skeuomorphism, where change of material is ac
companied by minimal change of form; 2. Environmental dis
placement, where change of geographical or physiographical habitat involves inevitable change of form or material to suit
local conditions; 3. Change of function, which carries with it
some adaptation to new uses and purposes. The first principle is illustrated by Egyptian columns and capitals, going back to actual bundles of papyrus or lotus stalks, or to palm trunks;
another illustration may be taken from the recessed niches which characterize the exterior of Babylonian and early Egyptian adobe buildings and which are also derived from building with
reeds. The second is illustrated by the southward expansion of the northern hearth house (megaron, etc.) and the northward movement of the courtyard house (originally an enclosure for
cattle with a hut) , or by the evolution of the platform temple
of early Babylonia into the temple-tower (ziqqurat) . The third may be illustrated by the growth of typical synagogue architec
ture out of the private Graeco-Roman villa.89
Turning now to the bearing of archaeology on various



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 31
branches of historical science, we may select first the subject of
demography, or the state and movement of population. The
best recent illustration of its applicability here is furnished by
Nelson Glueck's work in Transjordan since 1933. In six years
he has traversed all southern and central Transjordan re
peatedly, recording all ancient sites and dating their occupation
from surface remains, mainly potsherds. The dating of sherds,
already known from previous work in Palestine and TransJordan, has been checked and corrected by several excavations in different parts of the country. Owing to the fact that there is
hardly a true mound in the whole of Transjordan south of the
Jabbok such surface exploration, if as carefully done as in this
case, yields entirely satisfactory results in the vast majority of
sites. In true mounds or in sites which have been continuously occupied for a long period, remains of earlier settlement are
often completely buried under later strata, but the discontinuity
of sedentary occupation in Transjordan precluded the formation of true mounds, so that sherds from earlier occupations, where they exist, are almost always to be found scattered on the surface or the slopes below a site. Several hundred pre-Byzantine
sites have been studied and proved to belong almost exclusively to three well-defined ages, with yawning gaps between them.
The first of these ages covers the latter part of Early Bronze and the beginning of Middle Bronze, between 2400 and 1900 B. C; the second covers the Early Iron, from the twelfth (or thirteenth) to the seventh century B. C.; the third is Nabataean
Roman and begins about the second century B. C. Occupation was still sparse in the first period, it increased several times in
density in the second (which corresponds to the kingdoms of
Edom, Moab, and Ammon in the Bible), and became still
denser in the third. Subsequent repopulations have not equalled
the density of population in early Roman times. It would have
been impossible to have deduced these facts from available
written sources.
Archaeology has a direct and obvious bearing on questions
of social and political organization, though great care must be exercised not to generalize on insufficient basis. Glueck's ex
plorations prove directly that periods of agricultural occupation
of Transjordan alternated with periods of nomadism. The



32 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
contrast between the ubiquitous fortifications of Canaanite age
and the large proportion of unwalled towns and villages in
Israelite or later times shows that there was marked improve
ment in public security, evidently combined with more stable
political organization. Periods in Babylonia and Egypt where
we find unusual activity in temple construction inevitably appear
in written documents as dominated by priestly systems. The coexistence of mansions and hovels in Bronze-Age towns of Palestine demonstrates striking social inequality, which contemporary written documents show were due to an aristocratic class system, where the normal population was divided into a patrician caste and an amorphous mass of serfs and slaves.
The disproportionate space occupied by granaries (grain-pits or
silos) inside Palestinian towns of Late Bronze and Iron I, when compared with towns of Middle Bronze and Iron II, indicates
both a sparser population and greater insecurity, deductions
which are justified by demographic and other evidence. The
plan and organization of such a South-Judahite town as Tell
Beit Mirsim (probably Kiriath-sepher) in Iron II, with striking homogeneity in plan and size of houses and with unusually numerous looms and dye-plants, suggests some sort of craft or
guild organization, a deduction supported by documentary sources.
Archaeology has often, however, been expected to carry more than its weight. Excellent illustrations are found in the
frequent attempts made to equate a given culture even a ceramic culture with a physically defined race or a linguistic group. Such deductions are based on the logical fallacy of concomitance where concomitant variation is not demonstrated.
Race, culture, and language are heterogeneous entities; they tend to be associated, but exceptions are so numerous that no safe rule can be established. Other equally cogent illustrations
come from efforts to define some still unknown aspect of civilization by a different aspect which is archaeologically known:
e. g., to describe religion on the basis of pottery painting or mathematical attainments on the basis of empirical mastery of
the art of building. Even more dangerous are the constantly recurring attempts to establish a correlation between line
painting and social organization, between architecture and



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 33
literary genres, between peculiarities of material culture and the intellectual, aesthetic, or spiritual life of a people (see
Chapter II). In the present work we shall strenuously resist all temptation to reconstruct the world of the spirit from fancied
material analogies. This warning does not mean that anepigraphic archaeology
cannot throw important light on religion. The excavation of
temples or outdoor places of worship, of idols, amulets, and cult-objects, of bones of sacrificial animals, etc., gives us a
picture of the material, physical aspect of any religion which cannot be entirely replaced by written documents, though such finds cannot enable us to reconstruct details of priestly organiza
tion, of liturgy, or of mythology. Cultic scenes like those familiar in Egyptian temples and tombs or like the representa
tions on the sarcophagus of Hagia Triada in Crete do replace mythological texts to a certain extent, and even such a plastic
tableau as is found on a pottery cult-stand at Beth-shan gives some idea of the nature of Canaanite mythology an idea con
firmed rather strikingly by the mythological poems of Ugarit
and other comparable data.
D. ORAL AND WRITTEN TRANSMISSION OF HISTORY
Though this is primarily a subject for the philologian and the folklorist, such brilliant illumination has been shed on many
pertinent questions by archaeology that we are amply justified
in including the following section in this chapter. As is well known, the pendulum of opinion has swung from one extreme to the other in determining the relative importance of history,
mythology, and pure story-telling in a given poetic saga or folkloristic cycle. First, let us consider the characteristics of oral tradition as a medium for the transmission of literary and
documentary matter.
1. The Characteristics of Oral Tradition
Strictly speaking, there is no hard and fast, or even reasonably
dear line which can be drawn between oral and written trans
mission of records. As has often been emphasized by scholars,
writing was used in antiquity largely as an aid or guide to



34 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
memory, not as a substitute for it. It was so employed in
classical antiquity, where pupils were expected to memorize
Homer and Vergil, and it has been even more completely true in
the East at all times. Even today Moslem boys learn the Qur'an
by heart and use the printed text only to correct mistakes. The
same is said to be true of Hindu students of the Vedas to this
day and the practice of committing the Chinese classics to
memory only began to disappear in the past generation.
Down to the World War Jewish students of the Bible and
Talmud in Eastern Europe often memorized large parts in extreme cases even the entire Bible or (mirabile dictu!) Talmud.
It is a very well-known fact that the Mishnah and Gemara were both composed and transmitted orally, and there is no direct
evidence that the Talmud had been reduced to writing before the Middle Ages, though it may be safely assumed that it was.
Similarly, the Qur'an was transmitted by memory (in large
part) from the time of its oral delivery at Mecca and Medina
until some time after Mohammed's death. The case of the Rig
veda is by far the most striking of all, since its oral composition
must be dated somewhere in the second millennium, probably before 1200 B. C, and it cannot have been reduced to writing
until after the brahmi script had been adapted from a Persian
Aramaic prototype about the fifth century B. C. The Vedas may
not actually have been put into writing until the renaissance of Sanskrit literature which began in the fourth century A. D.
It was not only the Rig-veda which was handed down for many
centuries by word of mouth; the later Vedas and the Brahmanas were also transmitted orally and it is believed by many scholars
that the great bulk of early Sanskrit liturgical and grammatical
work was composed by word of mouth.40
A clear distinction must be made between different forms of oral composition, since the ease and success of transmission
without the aid o writing depends largely upon the stylistic medium. Here it is generally recognized that the verse form is much better adapted for oral transmission than is any kind
of prose. The ease with which children learn poetry is well
known; lists and recipes were formerly put into verse for
mnemotechnic purposes. Historically this principle is illustrated
by the simple fact that very few prose compositions are known



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 35
to have been handed down by word of mouth, whereas this is certain of poetic works in all parts of the Old World. Aside
from verse forms we also have prose legal and liturgical codes
for which oral transmission is certain or probable. Here again
we note the tendency to put legal corpora into formulaic style;
this is illustrated by the Hebrew Book of the Covenant, the Ten Commandments, the Code of Hammurabi, the Sumerian,
Hittite, and Assyrian laws, etc. This is equally true of other
codes of law, such as the Laws of Manu in India. The Egyptian
Negative Confession, the religious and cultic prescriptions of the Shurpu series in Mesopotamia, the cuneiform collections
of omens, etc., all show the same tendency to stylistic uniformity.
In the case of the Talmud we have something else; here
individual opinions and stories are remembered separately and
the association of ideas and content provides the connecting
link. Moreover, the present uniformity of the Babylonian
Talmud should not mislead one into assuming that Talmudic
literature always possessed it. That it did not is established by comparing parallel recensions of Talmudic material such as are
found in the Yerushalmi and the Bavli. In practice the two forms of stylistic transmission cannot be
sharply differentiated, since there must nearly always have been a short period of prose transmission before the traditions
were put into verse form. In many cases we can show that our
present prose form of an orally transmitted document is the
result of a secondary adaptation or abstract. This secondary
prose stage is found in many Graeco-Roman logographers and
historians who narrate Homeric or other saga; it is found in
Geoffrey of Monmouth and his successors down to Malory; it
occurs in the Old Norse (Icelandic)
"
prose Edda," which gives a digest and account of older poetic sources (Edda) ; it is clearly
present in the prose version of certain biblical stories which also
occur wholly or partly in poetic form (e.g., the Song of
Deborah) .
Since the Gestalt psychologists have called attention to the
demonstrable tendency of the mind to grasp selected composite forms and patterns as easily as it can grasp simple ones, as well
as to the even more significant mental habit of impressing
familiar patterns on groups of sensations and ideations, it is



36 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
much easier for the folklorist to understand the mechanism of
transmission of story motifs. Following the folkloristic atomism
of investigators before the War, a reaction set in and it became
recognized that many units of story-telling were complex. Even
when story motifs can be found in different contiguous lands,
it is not safe to assume original relationship or borrowing
except where the motif is complex, forming a pattern. An illustration of such a complex motif is the widespread myth of
a goddess of fertility who seduces a young god or hero, who thereupon emasculates himself, leaving his testicles to form the commencement of a fertility cycle (the Adonis-Attis-Bitis
cycle).
41 The contemporary British school of comparative re
ligion, best represented by S. H. Hooke, is now applying the
principle of patterns with great enthusiasm to the history of ancient Near-Eastern religions.
42 In dealing with mythology
and cult-practices we can safely stress the psychological principle of Gestalt: the behavior of an element in a pattern is not
determined so much by the class to which the element may
belong as to the structure or field (i. e., pattern) of which it forms part. Since General Smuts has popularized the philosophical doctrine of holism, no thinker can fail to grasp the
obviousness and even the necessity of this principle. The
demonstration that it really operates in human thinking has often been given experimentally in the past decade and a half by the adherents and friends of the Gestalt school.
A very important characteristic of oral transmission of litera
ture and history is its didactic quality. This quality is largely responsible for oral transmission, especially in the field of law and liturgy, where there is little or no aesthetic pleasure in
reciting or listening to recitation. Even in singing or chanting
poetical compositions and in reciting prose tales, however, the
didactic part is by no means absent, since such appeal to the senses and the emotions has always been recognized by teachers and preachers as essential to successful instruction in traditional
ethics or social practice. Illustrations are innumerable; we may
cite the poems of Hesiod, the didactic poems of Egypt, of
Mesopotamia, and of Palestine, the fables of Aesop, the para
bles of Jesus, the haggada of the Rabbis. In judging orally
transmitted literature we must also remember that the direct



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 37
pedagogical complexion of this literature is indirectly increased by the selective character of transmission by word of mouth.
Unnecessary and superfluous elements are dropped and only
those elements are retained which have some positive appeal to
the emotions or the intellect or which have clear pedagogical
value. 48 Historical narratives or data (aside from bodies of customary
law or liturgy, etc.) are usually transmitted orally in the form of poetic saga, though prose tales and traditions of historical
nature are also common. From what we have said above, it is
reasonably clear that, as a rule, poetic sagas are preferable as historical sources to prose traditions concerning the same
events, unless the latter are quite recent. However, saga is
seldom labelled as such, but must be distinguished from myth
and from Marchen. There are no formal differences of language or style to indicate the distinction, which must therefore be
based entirely on intrinsic evidence. We cannot propose a com
pletely satisfactory solution of the problem, which has vexed scholars for nearly 2500 years, since Hecataeus of Miletus first
rationalized mythology. However, the comparative history of religions, comparative folklore, and comparative mythology
have made it possible to classify masses of ancient literary
material as mythology or as folklore. We can dismiss narratives
of definitely cosmogonic or cosmological nature at once, though
we cannot deny the ultimate historicity of this or that figure who plays a role in them without careful critical study of the figure
in question and not always even then. We can also today dis
miss narratives which are obviously associated with any one of
a number of standard fertility myths.44 But when we come to such epics as the Sumero-Accadian Gilgamesh or Lugalbanda and the Canaanite Keret or Dan'el it is not so easy, since they
are superficially hard to distinguish from the Accadian epic of
the King of Battle (shar tamkhari}** or from the Iliad and
Odyssey, all of which swarm with mythological or marvellous
episodes. Until about forty years ago historians were divided into two schools, one of which denied any historicity or at least
any appreciable historical value to mythically colored saga,



38 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
while the other was inclined to minimize the mythical element
and even to claim many demigods and "
high
" gods as origin
ally human figures. The study of the process of myth-making
by Hugo Winckler and others has shown that oral tradition
inevitably carries with it the possibility of adding folkloristic
elements, as illustrated by the legends often of mythical origin which have gathered around every notable monarch
or sage. The nature of the mythical or folkloristic framework
in which historical facts may be set by tradition, depends upon the suggestive power of the historical material in question.
We need only refer to the treatment of such well known historical characters as Alexander the Great in the Roman
Byzantine age, as Vergil, Charlemagne in mediaeval Europe, as
Solomon in early Islam and as Harun er-Rashid in more recent
Islam. The ancient Orient provides many striking cases, brought
to light by archaeological research in the past few decades. In
Mesopotamia outstanding illustrations are the monarch Sargon
of Accad (25th century B. C), Queen Semiramis (9th century
B.C.). Egypt yields such figures as Imuthes (Imhotep), originally a high official under king Djoser, first king of the Third
Dynasty (not later than the 26th century B.C.); Amenophis the son of Paapis (cir. 1400 B.C.); the composite figure of
king Sesostris; and many others. Syria yields the semi-mythical figure of the wise Dan'el, mentioned by Ezekiel and the central
figure of a Canaanite epic text; much later we find that Queen Stratonice (third century B. C.) has been decked with a myth
belonging to Astarte. Clearly, if we can remove the folkloristic
accretions we shall find important nuclei of truth in popular descriptions of these figures and their deeds. Each case must be
studied by itself; thanks to the evidence derivable from com
parative mythology and folklore, from pertinent philological
and linguistic analysis, and now from archaeological sources,
we can often determine the boundary between legend and
history. In recent decades there has been a steady increase of the use
of aetiology (the analysis of stories explaining ancient names
or practices) to identify legendary accretions in orally trans
mitted material. The discovery and application of the method
of form criticism, especially by H. Gunkel, M. Dibelius, and



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 39
their followers, have given a great impetus to the utilization
of the aetiological method, which has now reached a point
where its leading exponents are inclined to deny the historicity
of nearly all early stories of both the Old and the New Testament. This goes much too far. In the first place, the principle
works both ways, like many other phenomena which are closely
connected with social or psychological activity. The practice
of giving explicit aetiological explanations originated as a
mnemonic didactic aid, in accordance with the tendency which
we have discussed above. When events of the recent past are
mentioned, it is only natural to call attention to the place where
they occurred, especially if there should be some striking natural phenomenon near by or if the event has given its name to the
place, as very often happens. As a matter of fact the writer has found that Arab narrators of Dura in southern Palestine lay
great stress on explaining just where events of recent traditional history have occurred, and they often bring in names or other
peculiarities of the places in question.
46 The operation of the principle could hardly be reversed until it had been firmly established in the practice of narrators and teachers, as an obvious as well as a customary aid to memory, a kind of associational aid of the same basic nature as the quipu or as picto
graphs, but of much greater effectiveness. Intellectual curiosity
grows by what it assimilates, even among relatively primitive folk; curiosity must be frequently aroused and satisfied before
it can arise spontaneously. No one would think of asking why a
place had a certain name unless his interest in the meaning of
place-names had been somehow stimulated. The idea that a
peculiar natural formation or a curious custom had some
aetiological explanation would not occur to a man unless he had previously learned that such explanations existed in similar
cases. The principle in question is particularly clear in the aetiology of liturgical practice, since the concocting of historical or mythological explanations for a given cultic act or series of acts necessarily follows the stage of symbolic mimesis or the
dramatization of myths. Of course, myths themselves often
result from the combination of a series of still more primitive
cultic acts, usually of sympathetic or homoeopathic character. But such a primitive series of acts cannot be put into dramatic



40 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
form until they have been connected by a story sufficiently exciting to stimulate mimesis. In this connection it should be emphasized that recent discoveries in Egypt and Babylonia have
demonstrated the great antiquity of mimetic rites and cultic
dramas, previously assumed by many historians of religion
but without adequate proof.47
We now come to the vexed question of the historicity of oral
tradition. In preceding paragraphs it has been shown how
dependent oral tradition is on form and on mnemonic aids. We may go a step farther and point out that the reliability of tradi
tion is affected strongly by cultural and social forms. Where
great stress is laid upon noble lineage and on the validation of
claims of property or of prestige, as in either a patriarchal or a feudal society, genealogy and tribal or chivalric history flourish.
The importance attached to traditional genealogy among the
Hebrews, the Arabs of early Islamic times, the modern Suda
nese, the Malagasy, and the Hawaiians, to give only selected cases, is well established. Many Bedouin or half-Bedouin Arab
tribes still preserve their traditional genealogies by word of
mouth. The men of Dura, for example, though partly sedentary, are organized in strictly tribal and clan forms and nearly all intel
ligent men or tribal heads know their ancestral trees back ten or eleven generations to the time of the conquest of the older Arab
peasants by the Bedouin Abu Darahimah, and can give the more
salient facts about tribal movements from the time when their
ancestors left the Hejaz in Arabia. Moreover, it is very im
portant to emphasize that a difference often exists between
the reliability of oral tradition in regions or periods where
writing was known, even though sparingly used, and where it
was not in use at all. Other things being equal, the reliability
of tradition is much greater in the former case, since the control
exercised by written documents and by scribes or archivists, who must have had some preparation to use them, is by no means
negligible, as archaeological research is now demonstrating more and more clearly.
Since this question is very important for our judgment of the early historical traditions of Israel, three parallels may be briefly treated: Homeric Greece, royal and early republican Rome,
Arthurian England. We must emphasize the fact that early



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 41
Israel seems to have a distinct advantage in this respect over
the first parallel. In Greece the art of writing seems to have
been neglected by the Greeks themselves between the end of the Mycenaean age in the twelfth century B. C. and the
adoption of the Phoenician alphabet in the eighth. In other
words, the Greeks may have been unable to write in the age
which began soon after the events described in the Iliad and
they did not cultivate writing again until the age of colonization
and the beginning of the Olympiad chronology (776 B. C.).
48
The Iliad can hardly have been reduced to writing until the
seventh century at the earliest and may not have been written
down until the beginning of the sixth (under Pisistratus) . Yet
the Iliad, which records events belonging to the end of the
Bronze Age and was perhaps put into epic form a century or
two after the Fall of Troy, preserves the geography and the cultural life of the Mycenaean age with surprisingly few ana
chronisms, as shown most effectively by M. Nilsson in his
Homer and Mycenae (1933) . The principal towns of the Iliad, such as Mycenae, Argos, Orchomenus, and Pylus (where Blegen has just discovered a wealthy Mycenaean settlement of the 13th century with an archive of 600 clay tablets), prove to have been
the chief Mycenaean centres, though they later lost their importance in many cases. Houses, clothing, arms and modes of warfare, etc., are generally Mycenaean rather than of the Iron Age. Ethnic, political, and international conditions are generally not suited to the Iron Age but reflect earlier conditions, after the fall of the Hittite empire and before the Dorian invasion and the beginning of Greek colonization. In other words, the
burden of proof is increasingly on those scholars who deny the basic historicity of the Iliad.
Turning to royal and early republican Rome in the seventh,
sixth, and early fifth centuries B. C., we find ourselves com
ing into a milieu where writing was known. The earliest
Etruscan inscriptions go back to about the end of the seventh
century, which is probably also the date of the earliest known
Latin ones. But the Etruscans were a settled and civilized people
from the late eighth century, at least, and Greek colonies were
established in Campania about the same time. Excavations in
Rome itself have demonstrated beyond cavil that it was a



42 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
flourishing city with splendid public buildings in the seventh
and sixth centuries B. C. Etruscan influence in the art of build
ing is now just as clear to archaeologists as it is to philologists
in the Roman language, religion, and political organization. All this warns against taking the nihilistic attitude toward early
Roman historical traditions about the Etruscan dynasty and even
the early Republic that was so common in the 19th century.
49
Archaeology has also made great strides in England during
the past few years and is increasingly able to throw light on the obscure and involved history of Great Britain in the fifth
and sixth centuries A. D. Here writing was known and practiced by the Britons (Latin) and the Irish (Latin and oghams)
as well as the English (runes), but there was so complete a
displacement of population that a large proportion of the places mentioned in the Arthurian cycle and related British (Welsh)
poetry fell into English hands long before the sagas were reduced to writing or were employed by extant historians as
sources of history. However, thanks to the new control of
tradition which archaeology affords in the hands of men like
Collingwood, Wheeler, and Crawford, the substantial histori
city of the Arthurian cycle is becoming more and more evident,
however much poetic fancy may have refracted and embellished
the facts. 50 When we compare the situation in early Israel or during the
formation of the Gospel tradition with our three parallels, we find marked superiority in the former case and an almost en
tirely different situation in the latter (which we need not de
scribe here) . First of all, the Israelite traditions belong to a
firmly established people, with strong tribal, family, and cultic ties, which require the existence of validating oral documenta
tion. Secondly, writing was known all through the period and
was used to an extent scarcely paralleled in early Rome or in
Homeric Greece, to judge only from inscriptions on stone or other inorganic materials. Counting both published and re
cently discovered but not yet published inscriptions, we now possess over a score of inscriptions in the Phoenician (Cana
anite) alphabet from Palestine, Syria, and Cyprus, all dating
from between 1200 and 900 B. C.; four of them come from
Israelite sites. This alphabet was already known to the



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 43
Canaanites in the Late Bronze Age, as we know from half-a
dozen inscriptions, two of some length, belonging to the period
between 1400 and 1200 B. C. What appears to be the same
alphabet is known in a still earlier stage (between 1700 and
1500 B. C.) from three or four inscriptions, all found in Pales
tine. That this alphabet was known to nomads as well as to
sedentary Canaanites is certain from the proto-Sinaitic inscrip
tions, dating from between 1800 and 1600 B. C.51 That it continued to be used by the nomads (or was reintroduced among
them) is certain from the fact that the forms of alphabetic
characters used among North Arabs and South Arabs in the seventh century B. C. go back to prototypes which must have diverged from corresponding Canaanite forms before 1400
B. C. 52 Moreover, quite aside from the proto-Canaanite script
from which Phoenician is descended, we now know that the Canaanites of about 1400 B. C. also employed Accadian cunei
form, the Ugaritic cuneiform alphabet, and Egyptian hiero
glyphics in order to write. We can hardly, therefore, be sur
prised to find archaeological discoveries confirming Israelite tradition almost always, as far as they go.
2. The Transmission of Written Documents
It is hardly necessary to discuss the familiar subjects of
textual ("lower") and historico-literary ("higher") criticism,
except when new light can be thrown upon them. The princi
ples governing the reconstruction of written documents which
have passed through many scribal hands are well known and
need not be repeated here. The rules of external and internal
evidence upon which documents may be dated or assigned to a
given author or milieu are also well known. However, our new
knowledge of the ancient Near East can contribute a great deal
to the formal evaluation of biblical literature. We shall take
up successively the principles of categories of composition
(Gattungsgeschichte}, of the authority of the written word, of
scribal revision of orthography and grammar, with a few words about the analysis of sources.
The principle of Gattungsgeschichte, of the study of the
categories of literary style, was first recognized and applied to
Graeco-Roman literature by the great classical scholar, Eduard



44 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Norden, in his Antike Kunstprosa (1898) and his Agnostos
Theos (1913), in which he showed the bearing of his methods
on the New Testament. In the same year H. Gunkel, who had
been thinking and writing along somewhat converging lines,
sketched a program for Old Testament literature which recognized Norden' s principles as fundamental in all study of ancient literary forms. M. Dibelius has applied Gunkel's methods to
New Testament research, going back beyond the present written text to find the pre-literary forms of discourse and of tradition.
The student of the ancient Near East finds that the methods of Norden and Gunkel are not only applicable, but are the only
ones that can be applied. In classical literature authorship is
usually known, but modern tests of style and language must be employed with great care, since a single author might employ very different style and vocabulary in different types of composition, whereas different authors may converge in style and
vocabulary when they imitate the same category of writing. In the Old Testament anonymity is more in evidence than in Graeco-Roman literature and the importance of categories of
composition is correspondingly greater. In Egyptian and cuneiform literatures the author of a composition is seldom known,
even when the narrative is couched in the first person, since
anonymous scribes were responsible for the execution almost
throughout. In these literatures the importance of categories of form is so great that it is a comparatively simple matter to distribute all known compositions among a limited number of
categories, within which there is surprisingly little variation.
These facts give sufficient warning against using canons of
style and vocabulary too rigidly in trying to determine authorship of passages in the Old Testament. At this point, however,
we must caution students against supposing that there was no
originality in the ancient Near East. There undoubtedly were
many gifted poets and narrators whose works made such an
impression on their contemporaries that they were more or less
slavishly imitated by others until a new category of writing was established. The principle of the authority of the written word is not
really new, since it has long been recognized as obtaining in
most periods and regions where the art of writing has been



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 45
sufficiently practiced. However, biblical scholars have been misled by the analogy of Graeco-Roman antiquity into exaggerating the possibility of "pious fraud" in the fabrication of written records and documents beyond all analogy. Nearly
every book and passage of the Old Testament has been stigma
tized as a literary forgery by at least one scholar. Now it cannot
be emphasized too strongly that there is hardly any evidence at
all in the ancient Near East for documentary or literary fabrica
tions. A few demonstrated ancient fabrications are known from
Egypt: inscriptions which purport to go back to much more ancient times, such as the so-called Bentresh stela and the
decree of Djoser on a cliff near Elephantine. Both, however,
have been shown to belong to the Ptolemaic period; i. e., they
belong to a time when the ethos of the ancient Orient had
already disappeared for ever. Of course, there are historical romances where only intrinsic evidence can demonstrate the fact that they are novels and not historical documents. In such
cases however, the script and language nearly always prove late
date and the principle of categories of form nearly always shows at once what their nature is. Both Egypt and Babylonia are
amply supplied with historical romances, mainly of folkloristic,
not "
literary
" character.53 The prolonged and intimate study of the many scores of thousands of pertinent documents from
the ancient Near East proves that sacred and profane documents
were copied with greater care than is true of scribal copying in
Graeco-Roman times. Even documents which were never intended to be seen by other human eyes, such as mortuary texts, manuscripts of the Book of the Dead, and magical texts, are
copied so that we can nearly always read them without difficulty if the state of preservation permits. Moreover, ancient Oriental
historians and liturgiologists were accustomed to include the
variants which had come down to them, so that their chrono
logical lists show swelling regnal and dynastic totals: e. g., Hammurabi is correctly credited in one list with 43 years as king of Babylon and in another with 12 years (i. e., his last 12) as king of Larsa, so a later scribal scholar attributes 55
years to him. R. Weill and others have pointed out how this
principle explains the abnormal swelling of Egyptian dynastic
totals in Manetho. 5* Successive editions of the Egyptian mortu



46 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
ary texts known as the Book of the Dead illustrate this process
of expansion by addition, especially when a given text can be traced from the Pyramids of the Sixth Dynasty through the
Coffin Texts of the Twelfth to successive recensions of the Book
of the Dead proper (from the Eighteenth Dynasty to the Hellenistic-Roman age). In such cases later recensions often contain commentaries and glosses to the original incantations
and sometimes additional commentaries on commentaries. 55
A principle which must never be lost sight of in dealing with documents of the ancient Near East is that instead of leaving obvious archaisms in spelling and grammar, as later became the fashion in Greece and Rome, the scribes generally revised
ancient literary and other documents periodically. This practice was followed with particular regularity by cuneiform scribes.
As a result scribes of the Middle-Babylonian age nearly always revise Old-Babylonian texts, substituting current grammatical forms and even contemporary phraseology. Neo-Babylonian
recensions of the same texts are still farther modernized. The reverse is also found, and we have attempts to write Old
Babylonian in Neo-Babylonian times, but the results are so indescribably confused that the modern cuneiformist can usually
fix the true date after a single rapid perusal. That spelling
was also modernized by biblical scribes we know now, thanks to Hebrew documents contemporary with different stages of
biblical literature, such as the Lachish letters. Here again scholars have frequently come to grief in trying to take the
present Hebrew text as reflecting the orthography of its
prototype.
Finally, a few facts may be pointed out which bear on the conventional methods of historico-literary criticism of the Bible. The tendency of ancient Oriental scribes and compilers to add rather than to subtract has a direct bearing on such questions as the method of compilation used by the ancient scholars to
whom we owe the Pentateuch. This means that the divergences
between narratives in the parallel documents J and E should
not be considered as average variation, i. e., as typical of the
differences between the documents, but rather as maximum variation; the real difference between the narratives of J and
E was thus materially smaller than is commonly supposed.



NEW HORIZONS IN HISTORY 47
Some of the most striking variations may probably be due to
divergent traditions which were both incorporated into either
J or E, as the case may be. It also means that much of the
expansion evident in legal and liturgic passages is not due to literary doublets but to the normal swelling of the text by the accretion of commentaries or of subsequent court decisions,
etc. 56 Driver and Miles have shown that many of the diver
gences between the Code of Hammurabi and the Assyrian laws
of about 1100 B. C. may be explained in this way. 57 It further suggests a rational way of explaining some of the high biblical
numbers. As critical study of the Bible is more and more
influenced by the rich new material from the ancient Near East
we shall see a steady rise in respect for the historical significance
of now neglected or despised passages and details in the Old
and New Testaments.



CHAPTER II
TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF
HISTORY
It is not enough for the historian merely to accumulate a
great mass of facts, no matter how well tested they may be as
to their accuracy and how well selected with reference to their
cogency and their representative character. Unless long occupa
tion with these facts has impressed on him certain conclusions as to the pattern which they form and the picture into which they fit, the accumulated mass will never become history. This
is not due, as is sometimes supposed, to the fact that history arose as a prose form of saga and thus possessed dramatic form and dramatic appeal from the outset. It is rather due to
the fact that human life moves in patterns and configurations,
whether we consider the life of an individual or the life of a nation, whether we describe the movement of a culture or the
development of thought. It is the inner compulsion of the underlying drama of history which has led nearly every great historian of the past to write history in essentially dramatic
terms, whether we turn to Herodotus, to Thucydides, to Livy, to Gibbon, or to Macaulay. Under the influence of the un
consciously felt configuration of historical data Voltaire ex
claimed, "II faut ecrire 1'histoire en philosophe!" It is true
that he had a very definite propagandist purpose in writing history, but he might have abandoned it in favor of natural science if it had not been for the fact that his philosophical spirit found congenial material in the world of history. For some 2500 years most historians have been reading their
own world-view or their own partisan standpoint into history, until it has come to be doubted whether it is possible to write it
impartially. Leading exponents of this relativistic position in
America are C. A. Beard and C. L. Becker. On the other side is
the great German "
positivistic
" school founded by L. von
Ranke (1795-1886) and Th. Mommsen (1817-1903), and
brought to a climax by the work of E. Meyer (1855-1930) .
1
To members of this school, influenced both by the high ideals
48



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 49
of accuracy set up by the German school of classical philo
logians and by the example of natural scientists, the task of the
historian was to reconstruct as true as possible a picture of what
actually happened in the past "wie es eigentlich gewesen,"
to quote Ranke's famous phrase. Later historians of this school,
dominated by evolutionary philosophy, often preferred to recast
it as " wie es eigentlich geworden," feeling that it was even
more important to know how a thing came to be than to know
just what happened. It is obvious that, whatever happens to
future history, scholars must always be profoundly grateful to
the men who were the first to recognize the supreme importance
of accuracy and completeness, both in defining facts and in explaining changes. However, it should also be rather obvious that the historian cannot limit himself forever to the accumulation of new facts and explanatory theories. If he should go on
indefinitely without trying to interpret and classify his data,
history would eventually collapse under its own weight. Natural science has only been able to maintain its effective
life and to progress toward new triumphs by periodically ordering its house, simplifying the task of the scientist by classifying masses of heterogeneous data under inclusive rubrics which
we know as " natural laws." This also the historian must
endeavor to do, though his task is far more difficult, owing to
the vastly greater part which caprice and indeterminacy play
in the domain of human affairs.
It is no longer possible to construct a philosophy of history without assuming some kind of evolution, whether it be the
naturalistic progressivism of eighteenth-century rationalists, the
metaphysical unfolding of Spirit which we find in Hegel, or
nineteenth-century biological evolution. The combination of the evolutionary principle with positivistic historical research has given rise to a rather amorphous tendency to which the
name " historicism "
(Historismus} has been conventionally
applied. Since the term was coined by critics of the historical
method as a label for some sceptical and deterministic ten
dencies among modern historians, it has acquired a certain
pejorative connotation. At its worst historicism leads, as
pointed out by Troeltsch, to " relativistic scepticism regarding
values and to doubts as to whether historical knowledge is



50 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
attainable or is significant if attained "
(Gesammelte Schriften, III, p. 108). In biblical research historicism has led to an
exaggerated emphasis on the evolutionary principle in which
unilinear schemes have become beds of Procrustes. All social, religious, or institutional phenomena must be made to fit into a
given bed, regardless of the chronology or function which tradition accords them. If a phenomenon seems too advanced for its
traditional phase it is assigned
" on internal evidence " to a
later stage; if it appears too primitive it is pushed back into an earlier phase, regardless of extrinsic evidence or lack of evidence. Against this exaggerated form of historicism vigorous
protests have recently been made by men of such different backgrounds and viewpoints as the Swiss Old Testament
scholar, W. Eichrodt,2 and the American philosopher, Morris
R. Cohen. 3
Our brief survey of the philosophy of history cannot be
restricted to the field of religion in which we are here most
interested, since the history of religion cannot be adequately understood except as a part of the history of culture. Moreover,
the principles in which we are primarily interested apply to all
branches of history alike, though not always to the same degree.
The material from which the historian of religion selects his pertinent facts is the same as that from which every historian
must draw; religion is an essential part of human cultural evolu
tion and much more important even to the positivist than some phases of culture which have been given factitious signifi
cance in our own day. At the same time, we shall draw most of our illustrations from the history of religion, and all our
applications will bear primarily upon the religious history of
the ancient Near East, in particular on biblical religion.
A. GENERAL TENDENCIES IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
In order not to be crushed by the weight of partly irrelevant
material we shall limit ourselves to the period introduced by
Hegel's Philosopkte der Gescbicbte (begun 1825 but not fully
published until 1837) and shall select only a few outstanding phases of subsequent development. Owing to the significance
of the current encyclopaedic-classificatory movement we shall devote special attention to it.



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 51
1. From Hegel to the Sociologists
The dominating concept o Hegel's philosophical thought
was, as known to all, his " dialectical "
concept of three stages
in thought and nature: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. This
triad means that every concept or experience involves the existence of its opposite, which follows and reacts against its
activity. The inevitable conflict is reconciled by the synthesis,
which comprehends and elevates thesis and antithesis alike. Owing to Hegel's dominant interest in fields related to man,
such as political science, aesthetics, and religion, he was able
without difficulty to classify practically all phenomena on which
he touched in triads, a plan which gives his philosophy a
strangely artificial appearance, at the same time that it imposes
itself by its simplicity and harmony. According to Hegel three
main phases of history may be distinguished, both geographi
cally and politically. The first stage is Asiatic and is illustrated
by China, India, and the Near East. In this stage, the thesis, the individual is absolutely subject to the will of the ruler and the state is an absolute monarchy. Asia was the scene of man's infancy, where he was still dominated by nature instead of
spirit. The second stage is Mediterranean and is represented
by the classical civilization of Greece and Rome. Here man
grew to maturity, reacting against the absolutism of Asia and
developing some measure of individual freedom. Rome disciplined the culture of Greece and taught the individual to retain his freedom while subjecting his will to the needs of the state. In the third and final stage comes synthesis, in which Germanic
culture triumphs and man becomes conscious of his freedom, but freely wills the submergence of the individual in the uni
versal idea. This corresponds to old age, but Hegel emphasized
that the old age of spirit is its strongest phase and that only nature becomes senescent. Hegel impressed his contemporaries and successors both with the originality and sweep of his philo
sophical conceptions and with the wealth of illustration from
world-history which he gave to support them. The strongly nationalistic flavor of his philosophy of history prevented it for
decades from exercising much influence outside of Germany, but there it had tremendous success. Even the violent reaction



52 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
which set in against his teachings did not affect their triumphal advance, since his indirect influence on the past century has
been incomparably greater than his direct impact.
The best illustration of the influence of Hegel in the field
which interests us here primarily is F. C. Baur's work in New Testament history and theology, which began in 1831 and con
tinued until his death in I860. The Tubingen school which he founded, was very influential for several decades and has
exerted a lasting effect on New Testament studies. Since Baur was an ardent Hegelian he carried out a thorough-going recon
struction of New Testament history according to Hegelian
principles. To him the key to the beginnings of Christianity lay in the conflict between Jewish parochialism and universalism.
Jesus and the first disciples, headed by Peter, were resolute champions of a Jewish gospel. The antithesis to this thesis was
provided by Paul's universalism, followed in the second century
by a synthesis of Judaizing and universalizing tendencies, a
synthesis represented by the latest N. T. books and exemplified by the Catholic church of the early Christian centuries. All the
books of the New Testament were arranged in historical order
according to their relation to this controversy, beginning with the four Pauline epistles which were considered as authentic by
Baur (the rest being of later origin) , i. e., Galatians, Corin
thians I-II, and Romans. Then came the Synoptic Gospels and finally the Gospel of John, which Baur dated about 160 A. D.
or even a little later, accompanied by some minor epistles. Owing to the artificial and unilinear character of Baur's reconstruction and to the extreme lateness of his dates, his position
is no longer held by any scholar of repute, though it enjoyed a temporary and partial rehabilitation in the work of the Dutch school around the turn of the century. However, the problems which he formulated still remain in the foreground of research
and New Testament scholarship has never lost the Hegelian coloring which it received from Baur.
Somewhat less drastic in its application of Hegelian princi
ples to the reconstruction of history and much more solidly established in detail was J. Wellhausen's brilliant formulation of a coherent system of the religious evolution of Israel,
first presented in his famous Prolegomena (1878). In the



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 53
introduction to this work Wellhausen freely acknowledged his
debt to W. Vatke (1806-1882), from whom he had " learned
the most and the best." Vatke was an ardent Hegelian, who
was one of the first and most untiring exponents of Hegel's
system among the theologians of Germany; his most important
book on biblical theology (1835) is saturated with Hegelian
terminology. Wellhausen and his school, to which belonged in
the last decade before the World War practically every Protes
tant Old Testament scholar of standing in the world, reflect their Hegelian background in various ways: in the division of
O. T. religion into three phases, animism (polydemonism, etc), the prophetic stage (henotheistic) , the nomistic stage (monothe
istic) ; in the chronological arrangement of Hebrew literature
in the order, early poetry, prophetic writings, legal codes; in the unilateral theory of evolution and in the Hegelian view that
the fully developed religion of Israel unfolded gradually from primitive naturalism to lofty ethical monotheism. In stressing
the origin of these ideas we do not, of course, mean to refuse
them any validity. But for all the arbitrary and romantic elements in Hegel's
philosophy of history, both philosophers and historians must remain forever in his debt. For the first time he brought
together the data of history in a rational synthesis, exhibiting the progress of humanity from its Asiatic cradle to modern
Western Europe and clearly recognizing the fact of cultural
evolution. The connecting thread might be inadequate and the
resulting construction badly lop-sided yet an imperfect classifi
cation is better than no classification at all.
Over against the Hegelian and neo-Hegelian schools must be
set the positivistic school, which was not nearly so original as
that of Hegel and may be said to have emerged almost spon
taneously from the spirit of the age, much as has been true of
instrumentalism in more recent America. The initiator of the
movement was Auguste Comte, a younger contemporary of
Hegel, and its best known representatives were perhaps John
Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer. This movement was so closely identified with the scientific activity of the nineteenth century
that it spread rapidly and is found, explicitly or implicitly,
in nearly all historical and sociological theorizing of the past



54 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
sixty years. In his great work, Cours de philosophie positive
(1830-1842), Comte presented an encyclopaedic system of thought, which he endeavored (often with signal lack of suc
cess) to base on scientific methods. Somewhat like Hegel,
though quite independently, he based his system on a theory of three stages of mental activity: theological, metaphysical, and positivistic or scientific. All thinking begins with the first, passes through the second, and reaches its climax in the third
stage. In the theological phase itself, again superficially like
Hegel, he recognized three evolutionary stages, fetishism, polytheism, monotheism. Comte insisted at every opportunity that religion must be studied like any other natural phenomenon.
Mill was even more rigidly rationalistic in his outlook than Comte. Spencer's immense synthesis exerted tremendous influ
ence on his contemporaries, but is practically forgotten now.
He seized on the discovery of biological evolution by Darwin and built up a most elaborate system, half speculative, half
encyclopaedic, on the basis of the potent new clue to the
sequence of phenomena.
A multitude of historians and philosophers now adopted the
watchword " scientific method " and undertook to reconstruct
historical thinking along essentially positivistic lines. As long as they subordinated metaphysics (pace Comte) to the collec
tion of historical data according to the methods of the great German school of Ranke and his successors, no serious harm
was done by a little cheap rationalism, but the urge for sys
tematization often carried them far beyond the limits of objective knowledge, as illustrated by E. Renan in France and many
lesser men elsewhere. Through pragmatism the positivist path
in philosophy led to John Dewey and American instrumen
talism, where the philosophy of history becomes increasingly relativistic and history tends to become a means of liberal propa
ganda (C. A. Beard and others) . Thus the very philosophic
movement which was to emancipate history completely from the
bonds of tradition and theology and which was to make it
"
truly scientific/' has led to its almost complete dethronement from the place of honor among the social sciences. Positivists
and instrumentalists have almost throughout based their system
not on scientific method in the proper sense of the term, but



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 55
rather on unwarranted analogies with the natural sciences. Since the philosophical system of mechanistic materialism
seemed to suit the increasingly experimental and statistical
methodology o the natural sciences, they have uncritically
assumed the correspondence as proved and have then taken
the resulting corollaries as postulates for their own systems. Curiously enough, the confidence of instrumentalists seems to have been more shaken by the internecine war between the statistical and the causal wings which has resulted from the
discovery of the principle of indeterminacy in nuclear physics (W. Heisenberg since 1925) than by such devastating analysis
of their position as that of A. O. Lovejoy in his Revolt against
Dualism (1930).
Meanwhile the movement launched by Hegel was by no
means doomed to sterility but continued to influence thinker after thinker, who in turn built up schools from which new
branches sprang until the wine of Hegelianism is sometimes
extraordinarily watered. Marx and Engels converted Hegel's dialectical idealism into dialectic materialism and a whole army
of lesser fry has tried to apply Marxianism to historical research, with the most fantastic results, since biblical and ancient Oriental facts are forcibly adapted to the Marxist pattern. A good illustration of the monstrosities of this method is found in
one of the most serious monographs on the history of Israel
which has emanated from the Marxist school: a study by M.
Lurje (1927) , who is said to have been subsequently
"
purged."
In his effort to "
prove
" the existence of capitalism in the
period of the Judges, for instance, Lurje assumes (without any
proof, of course) that Heb. raham (maiden) in Jud. 5: 30
means "
prostitute
"
(in defiance of philological evidence and
of common sense) . If there were prostitutes there was proxe
netism, which according to Marx is functionally dependent on the capitalistic system hence there was already (in eleventh
century Israel!) a developed capitalistic system! 4
One result of the Hegelian revival during the past fifty years has been increasing emphasis in certain circles on the
historical side of the historico-philosophical union of Hegel. Formally this development has had its extreme statement in
the work of Benedetto Croce, for whom history and philosophy



56 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
are theoretically one and the same: history is philosophy and philosophy is history. However, Croce's system remains too
abstract and remote from the spirit of the times to exert much
influence, except in the field of aesthetics. Oswald Spengler's
grandiose work, Der Untergang des Abendlandes (partial appearance 1918, complete publication 1922), though fanciful and arbitrary to the highest degree, continues the Hegelian tradition in so direct a way and with so showy a facade that it
has had and is still having a great effect on German thought.
Spengler hardly mentions Hegel at all, yet his system is so
saturated with Hegelian concepts and methods that it often
appears as a caricature of Hegelianism. With a curious blend
of Hegelian philosophy and Goethean romanticism as his foun
dation, Spengler constructed his system by combining encyclo
paedic range (including for the first time the ancient Orient)
with intuitive reasoning, where clever and occasionally almost
brilliant apergus replace inductive reasoning and sober use of
analogy. His basic idea is that chronology and the concept of destiny are for the historian what mathematics and the principle
of causality are for the natural scientist. For Hegel's three
stages of history he substitutes the designations
"
Magical
"
(i. e., Asiatic, including Christianity and Eastern European cul
ture),
"
Apollinian
"
(Graeco-Roman), and " Faustian "
(Germanic). Moreover, these stages and the individual cultures
which compose them are living organisms, which are born,
mature, decline, and die. All human phenomena within their
scope are integrated in them, so that every aspect of a given
culture is in organic relationship to every other. In Spengler's
pessimistic mood inevitable fate is substituted for the advance of spirit in the Hegelian system, which was founded on an optimistic outlook on the future of Germanic culture. Some
of the outrageous extravagances of Spengler's treatment of his
"
Magical Culture " have been pointed out by the late C. H. Becker, one of the foremost specialists in Islamic culture of
modern times. 5 It is not necessary to point out here what a tremendous influence Spengler has exercised on the growth of
racist thought, with his intuitive racial and national mysticism
and his fatalism, as well as his glorification of " Aryan " racial
achievements. Indirectly, he has helped materially to launch



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OP HISTORY 57
current tendencies in German historical and biblical scholarship, much of which has recently been devoted to the task of demonstrating the alleged antithesis between all forms of
"Jewish" life and culture and corresponding forms of
Germanism. Historical and biblical studies have been increasingly influ
enced during the past fifty years by ethnology and sociology,
particularly since the work of Robertson Smith and Sir James
Frazer in England, of E. Durkheim in France, and of Max Weber in Germany. Robertson Smith (after 1885) correlated
ethnological and Semitic data with great skill and learning; he introduced Tylor's concept of animism into the history of
Semitic religion and tried unsuccessfully to acclimate totemism there; he interested Frazer and others in the task of extending
the new method into other spheres of ancient history and
religion. With the beginning of Frazer's monumental publica
tion, The Golden Bough, in 1890, the anthropological method announced its extension to all antiquity. Following in the foot
steps of the folklorist Mannhardt and of the Semitist and
sociologist Robertson Smith, he built up an encyclopaedic col
lection of ethnographic data for the purpose of demonstrating
the origin and development of many phenomena in the history
of religion, such as fertility cults, rites of purgation, totemism,
the belief in the after-life, etc. Unhappily his attempted explanations are invariably too narrow in their scope and too rigidly causal in their underlying motivation. Small wonder that in the preface to the third edition of his Adonis, Attis and Osiris
(1914), he pessimistically exclaimed, "The longer I occupy
myself with questions of ancient mythology the more diffident
I become of success in dealing with them! " Frazer's influence
on Anglo-Saxon (and to some extent on French) historians of
religion has been very great, though more often as a source of ethnographic ideas and material than as a systematist, since Frazer's remoteness from philosophical speculation as such is
characterized by the fact that he knew nothing of Hegel's work
until nearly twenty years after his Golden Bough had begun to appear.
8
E. Durkheim must be counted among the leading thinkers of
modern times and he is often called " the father of scientific



58 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
sociology." However this may be, there can be no doubt of the
great importance of his work and of its profound influence on
modern European and more recently American thought. His
most significant work for our purposes is probably Les formes
elementaires de la vie religieuse (1912). Durkheim combined
a strong philosophical talent with a thoroughly objective ideal
of precision in recording data. He insisted throughout his work on treating the social group as the only independent element in sociology and history; all other social phenomena, including
religion, are essentially functions of society. Social life must be
explained primarily from itself, not by bringing in such external
factors as environment and psychology (though he did not,
of course, deny the importance of these factors in themselves) . Social forms, social consciousness, and social forces are, in his opinion, the central facts for both historian and sociologist to
consider. In pursuing the train of thought begotten by his
emphasis on the centrality of the social group as such, he
insisted that the collective mind exists independently of the
organic social group to which it belongs. Religion, in Durkheim's thought, is a valuable preservative and cohesive force, which functions as the collective spirit of the group. In other words, the source of religion is society and the idea of the sacred
is only a reflection of hypostatized society itself. The great contribution of religion has been in the creation and preserva
tion of social solidarity and it must, therefore, exist forever, in some form or other. The best illustration of the influence of the Durkheim school
on our field is perhaps the work of A. Causse, now conveniently
summarized in his book, Du groupe ethnique a la communaute
religieuse (1937) . Causse's position, which is carefully thought
out and clearly presented, is a very interesting illustration of
the impact of sociological conceptions on Hegelian Wellhausenism, with the remarkable result that Causse has unwittingly (as the writer learns from a personal communication) become
even more Hegelian in some respects than Wellhausen. 7 Fol
lowing Durkheim, he makes the development of Israel's religion
practically a function of its social evolution. Yahweh became
god of Israel with the covenant that united the tribes ; He be
came lord of the land and master of the state with the estab

lishment of the monarchy; He became universal God with the destruction of the state and the emergence of the Diaspora. The
evolution of the idea of God in Israel starts with a conception
of the deity as the spirit of the tribe, apparently in very much
the Durkheim sense, and ends with God as universal spirit
(-with strongly socialized definition of the term "spirit,"), a
development which reminds one of Hegel.
Max Weber (1864-1920) is probably the greatest sociologist yet to arise in Germany. Combining the breadth and accuracy of the trained historian with rare gifts of philosophic insight,
he has produced several masterpieces of historical sociology,
among which his book on Das antike Judentum (1920),
planned to be the first volume of a great work on the social and economic ethics of the three world religions (Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam), ranks deservedly high. Weber's special interest lay in the field of sociology of religion, and his contributions to this field are of lasting value, because of the
sanity of his approach and the mass of carefully sifted data
which he employed in all his work. According to Weber
economic, social, and religious factors influence one another
so strongly that they may be said to be interdependent, yet none
is a mere function of the others. A religion is never simply a form of social or economic activity, nor is the reverse any truer.
However, in many cases, where sufficient data are available,
it is quite possible to show that a given religious factor has profoundly influenced economics, or that a religious element
is causally dependent on an economic or social one. It is quite
impossible to do justice to Weber in a paragraph; we shall have occasion to mention specific contributions of his below. His
work has strongly influenced contemporary German students of the history of Old Testament religion; A. Alt, the foremost recent historian of Israel, and his students show the effect of Weber's thinking in nearly all their work.
To the sociological school belongs essentially J. Pedersen,
whose Israel (since 1920) is one of the most important con
tributions yet made to our understanding of Hebrew life and thought. His knowledge of the Semitic world and of the
literature dealing with the subject is so vast and his use of
ethnological and sociological data so objective that the work



60 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
will have permanent value, regardless of shifting systems and
theories. This does not mean, of course, that we can accept all his historical views.
2. The Encyclopaedic-Analytic Tendency in the Philosophy of History
Since 1934 a new movement has appeared on the horizon
and has attracted such general interest, even among laymen,
that we may safely predict extraordinary attention to the philosophy of history throughout intellectual circles in the coming
generation. This is undoubtedly due in part to the crisis of
international civilization through which we are passing, a crisis
that urges thinking men to look for solutions, or at least to devise explanations and forecasts. Since 1934 Arnold J. Toynbee
(born 1889) of the University of London has brought out the
first six volumes of a great work, A Study of History, planned
to include over a dozen volumes. In 1937 Pitirim A. Sorokin
(born in the same-year) of Harvard University published three
still more massive volumes, with a fourth to come later, entitled Social and Cultural Dynamics. Both works are of great
importance to philosophers of history, dwarfing predecessors in
this field by their volume and by the mass of data which they
include. Both are products of the modern occidental method
of providing a staff of research assistants and secretaries for a
selected few distinguished scholars. It must be said that the outlay in money and time is more than justified in these two cases.
Toynbee began his career as a classical scholar (he is the
son-in-law of Gilbert Murray), attaining some distinction in
the fields of Greek and modern European history, as well as
in international relations-, before he undertook the task of re
ducing historical data to a comprehensive system. It is not easy
to appraise an incomplete system which is developed in nearly
3000 pages, especially when the entire work is apparently
intended to cover more than 5000 pages! It is even harder to
condense an adequate acount of his system into a few para
graphs. He has collected an immense body of material, making
the collections of illustrative data by Hegel and his successors



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 61
seem insignificant and futile by comparison. It must also be said that the data are seldom wrong in themselves, except
where Toynbee has been misled by the specialists on whom he
must rely, or when he has tried to "cut corners " in his simpli
fication of complex processes. The work is admirably arranged,
beautifully written, and is remarkably free from sloppiness in
dealing with facts and citations.
Toynbee's philosophy of history is essentially organismic, recognizing the importance of treating history as the life of
societal organisms. He divides historical mankind into twenty
one "
societies/* which he schematizes as "
wholly unrelated, unrelated to earlier societies, infra-affiliated, affiliated I, affil
iated II, and supra-affiliated." Of these societies over half are extinct and seven have been discovered and reconstructed by
modern archaeology. For the first time, then, the results of archaeological labor here receive proportionate attention in a
treatise on the philosophy of history. Analysis of the individual
societies shows that they are in some cases independent of all
other cultures, in some cases successive phases in the history of
a single culture (Sumeric, Babylonic; Mayan, Yucatec, Mexic),
and in some cases a congeries of different racial, national, and cultural groups of very dubious coherence (Syriac, Western,
Orthodox Christian, Far Eastern) . The task of distinguishing
cultural groups of mankind is by no means a new one (Toynbee
points to Count de Gobineau as an early predecessor) and it will probably go on for a long time to come. It is not unfair to say that sudht divisions really exist, but that they cross one another
and change chronologically, geographically, and culturally to such an extent that they become rather useless as units of classi
fication. The only sound method of broad classification is to
employ the criterion of physical race for one category, that of
linguistic grouping (in a very wide sense) for another, that of
religion for a third, that of cultural facies for a fourth, and so
on. An attempt to take a common material culture as the basis
in one case and a common religious culture (Islamic, Christian) or even a racial background (as in dividing Islam into two separate modern societies, the Iranic and the Arabic) in another
can only lead to confusion. The biologist has much more precise
criteria at his command when he undertakes to divide living



62 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
beings into families, genera, and species, but he does not employ the larger classifications as a rule except for taxonomic
and phylogenetic purposes, limiting himself exclusively to the individual species (and often to an even smaller unit) for all
experimental or comparative research. This principle is at
least as true in human culture as in zoology and botany; we are
helpless in trying to define cultures unless we limit them, so
far as practicable, to relatively small units within a complex
(which would correspond roughly to Toynbee's "society").
In other words, if we take Egyptian cultural history as such a
complex we shall find some difficulty in setting up generaliza
tions (except perhaps in physical race) which would be true of
all its phases. We can only approach satisfactory results when
we divide it into its successive chronological phases, Old Em
pire, Middle Empire, New Empire, Bubasto-Saite, etc., and take
each of these phases as our unit. The larger division or complex
retains its classificatory and historico-genetic significance, but must not be made the basis for detailed research. From the foregoing remarks it will be seen that we consider this side of
Toynbee's investigation as relatively futile. Unfortunately, the weakness of Toynbee's method does not
end here. " The next step," he writes,
" in a study of history is to put these twenty-one societies through their paces and
compare their performances in their geneses and growths, their breakdowns and disintegrations, their universal states and uni
versal churches and heroic ages, their contacts in Time and Space." In his first three volumes (we shall not deal here with
Vols. IV-VI) he does not follow out this challenging program, but limits himself to studying various principles which bear on
the genesis and growth of civilizations. Here his method is fundamentally sound, since his concrete illustrations are drawn
from specific episodes and happenings in history. The number of examples is so great, they are so judiciously selected and so widely distributed among the twenty-one
"
societies/' that the method may be fairly considered as inductive. It is true that
he supplements his historical examples by drawing freely from a vast store of mythological and literary lore as well as from
the biographies of great men. Since mythology and literature
reflect the empirical observation of many generations of primi



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 63
tive men (who were by no means blind to what went on in the world around them) and many centuries o reflection on the
part of thinkers and poets, they may be cautiously used to supplement historical examples, though Toynbee sometimes over
steps the bounds o prudence in drawing upon unhistorical
sources. Sometimes one can hardly regard all his examples as
serious, as when he gives an impressive list of great men, ending
with Polybius, Clarendon, Ibn Khaldun, Confucius, Kant, Dante and Hamlet.
The fundamental principles which he derives by his inductive
methods are the following:
"
Challenge-and-Response
" as a
partial explanation of the genesis of civilizations;
" With
drawal-and-Return " as a partial explanation of the nature of
their growth. Both principles are elaborately illustrated by
examples. The former is divided into a series of special cate
gories: chalepa ta kala (" good things are hard ") , the stimulus
of hard countries, the stimulus of new ground, the stimulus of blows, the stimulus of pressures, and the stimulus of penaliza
tions. He emphasizes, however, that while civilizations are born and progress by the aid of external stimuli there is, none the
less, a "
golden mean." He further points out that a challenge or stimulus may be inadequate or it may be excessive. Aside from such points as the author's acceptance of Ellsworth Hunt
ington's erroneous hypothesis of climatic change (see below) ,
which seriously vitiate certain parts of his treatment, we can
only praise its conception and execution. To be sure, there is
nothing at all new about the idea of the value of the " hard
way " in human life, but it has been so consistently disregarded
or denied by modern writers and thinkers that it is a matter of
the greatest importance to have it presented as dearly and con
vincingly as has been done by Toynbee. Similarly, the principle
of the " conditioned reflex " is almost a matter of common sense
and every-day experience, yet its demonstration by Pavlov must be considered as one of the greatest psychological discoveries of modern times.
Toynbee's principle of " Withdrawal-and-Return " is not quite
as significant as the one just discussed, but it is also important. This principle he illustrates mainly from biographical sources,
extending his treatment by analogy and confirmatory examples



64 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
to the field of history. Great men, especially men of prophetic type, often exhibit periods of action separated from one another
by phases of complete inactivity or withdrawal into seclusion,
after which they emerge with fresh and " daemonic "
energy. Sometimes nations, or cultures, instead of growing, reaching
a climax, and declining for ever, show periods of curious in
activity, often accompanied by withdrawal from participation
in the international scene, after which they emerge, apparently
fresh as ever, for a fresh career of activity. The sensational
resurgence of German power since 1938 is a striking illustration. This idea is again not really new, but it has likewise been dis
regarded by recent writers, who prefer to stress the merits of
active, as against contemplative life and to exalt the nervous
energy of Europe at the expense of the quiescence of some other parts of the world. Toynbee thus appears in both ap
proaches to the problem of history as an old-fashioned spirit,
acquiring the reputation of a great innovator and even of a
prophet because he presents old but neglected principles with elaborate logical proof of their salient reality. All honor to
him for reinstating forgotten truths!
A violent onslaught on Arnold Toynbee's work was launched in 1936 by Lucien Febvre, the well-known collaborator of Henri Berr, under the informative title,
" De Spengler a Toynbee:
quelques philosophies opportunistes de 1'histoire." 8 The collocation of Spengler and Toynbee has no apparent purpose
except to show contempt for the latter, to whom almost the entire essay is devoted. Perusal of Febvre's onslaught reveals
no clear basis for his depreciation of Toynbee, except that of
pique: Toynbee does not mention nor apparently recognize the existence of the Berr-Febvre school of historical synthesis. Emerging about 1901 with the creation of the Revue de Syn
these historique, followed by works on historical synthesis and by other periodicals and series of books devoted to the same subject, this school has had a great deal of influence on French
and American historiography, as may be seen, for example, in
the somewhat abortive effort of the so-called " new history
"
of Robinson and Beard.9 The most concise statement of its methods and objectives has been given by Berr and Febvre in
their joint article on "
History
" in the Encyclopaedia of the



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 65
Social Sciences (1932). We have gone through the volumes
of the Revue and other products of this school, and have tried to be fair to them, but it must be confessed that they are most
disappointing. The epistemological foundation is weak (see
below) and the plan to bring about a synthesis of the past life
of man in all its multiform activities is superbly conceived but
badly executed. Instead of a synthesis Berr and his colleagues
have produced part of an historical encyclopaedia, characterized
by many of the faults of a standard publisher's undertaking and
by few of its virtues, since too many of the contributors are
quite incompetent.10
Turning from Toynbee to Sorokin, we pass from a highly
cultivated British humanist to a Russian sociologist with a varied record of administrative and scholarly achievement in
his field. His thick book on Contemporary Sociological Theories
(1929) shows his talents in a most favorable light. They in
clude extraordinary control of sociological and philosophical literature in practically every European language, thorough
independence and trained critical judgment, exceptional ability
in analyzing and characterizing systems of thought. On the debit side may be noted an omnivorous attitude to bibliography and a sloppy treatment of facts and citations, both of which stand in striking contrast to the fastidious standards of Toynbee. The first three volumes of Social and Cultural Dynamics also
exhibit the foregoing merits, as well as a capacity for organizing
and administering an elaborate project of research, involving
a tremendous amount of statistical work of the most varied character. On the other hand, these volumes show a pronounced
lack of ability to synthesize a lack which can hardly be made up for entirely by the publication of the fourth volume, since
it already appears too clearly in the introductory chapters of
Vol. I, in which Sorokin develops his methodology and explains
his purpose. Here again we are embarrassed by the difficulty of
giving in a few paragraphs an adequate statement of material
which covers more than 2000 closely printed pages! We shall
compensate in part for the impossibility of doing Sorokin full
justice by contrasting his approach and method with those of the British thinker. In contrast to Toynbee's universal sweep, Sorokin restricts



66 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
himself almost entirely to Europe in the past 2500 years, thus
including only two and a half of the former's twenty-one
"
societies,'
' and only half of his chronological scope. This
plan has both merits and disadvantages. On the one hand it
escapes the necessity of dealing with less familiar or less known regions and ages; on the other it leads the author to generalize from inadequate evidence and sometimes to show a striking
myopia in his historical perspective. Moreover, as a philosopher
rather than a historian, Sorokin is more interested in abstract
types than in concrete phenomena, as is illustrated by his dis
tinction between two pure types of integrated culture, ideational and sensate, in addition to which he lists two modified forms,
idealistic and mixed. By " idealistic " he means " a balanced
synthesis of both pure types/' From the standpoint of anthropology, this classification can have little meaning, but as an
interpretation of Western civilization from its emergence in
the sixth century B. C. to the present time, in terms of its highest
cultural manifestations, it has clear validity, though it is perhaps only one of several equally cogent clues.
Sorokin's epistemological approach is somewhat novel, and
stands in striking opposition to that of the whole positivistic
school of sociologists. He distinguishes between four main
types of cultural " elements *'
(i. e., complexes or patterns) :
(1) spatial or mechanical adjacency (congeries), (2) association due to an external factor, (3) causal or functional inte
gration, (4) internal or logico-meaningful unity. Only the two
last are pertinent to sociological thought. He rejects the third type, which is employed by nearly all sociologists of recent times, and prefers the fourth. This substitution of subjective
for "
trans-subjective
"
(objective) methodology is very remarkable and threatens to relegate Sorokin's whole epistem
ological system to the sphere of intuitive metaphysics, taking it out of the world of causal-functional and statistical phe
nomena, which is the only one that we can control by scientific methods. Since this epistemological foundation does not seem
to fit his statistical-analytical methods of research, we shall have to await the appearance of the fourth volume before making a
detailed criticism. Meanwhile, some observations are in order.
In " the logico-meaningful method of ordering chaos " Sorokin



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 67
does not see any uniformity of relationship between the variable elements of a complex, but rather "identity of meaning or
logical coalescence." " Hidden behind the empirically different,
seemingly unrelated fragments
" there is "an identity of
meaning." He does not deny that there are causally or func
tionally related parts of cultural patterns, but insists that they are rare, or at least can seldom be proved by known methods to exist. Instead of wasting effort on making laborious and often questionable additions to the stock of such relations, he
prefers to look for a " central principle which permeates all
the components . . . and in this way makes cosmos out of a
chaos of unintegrated fragments/* To determine just what
that " central principle is in a given case, only experience
and intuition can serve. In other words, " the proof of the
pudding is the eating thereof," a principle which is very useful as long as the investigator remembers that the result must stand every logical and factual test but which becomes exceedingly
precarious and even futile when he enters a domain where such
tests become impracticable or even impossible.
One cannot deny that Sorokin has displayed his analytical
talents to very good purpose in demonstrating the inadequacy
of the causal-functional method as applied even by anthropologists of the high standing of Clark Wissler and the late
Edward Sapir.
11 On the other hand, his approach is far more
dangerous than theirs, since it is largely beyond the reach of
scientific methods and thus lends itself to charlatanry. He has
performed a real service in emphasizing certain epistemological aspects of sociological investigation, but the application of
"
logico-meaningful
"
terminology and methods belongs, as he
frankly admits, to his own " ideational " horizon and is foreign
to the " sensate "
sphere in which productive scholarship has
hitherto moved. It is misleading to use the word "
logical
" in
this connection, since logic is scientifically useless unless it starts with axiomatic or demonstrated premises and postulates.
Sorokin, however, begins with intuitively enunciated principles,
on which he constructs a logical structure which is then made a frame of reference for elaborate statistical tables, from which he naturally makes deductions which agree with his principles
thus providing a beautiful example of a "
logico-meaningful
"



68 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
argumentum in circulo. If a worker in the " sensate "
sphere may be permitted to propose a sensate modification o his
fourth type of cultural pattern,
"
empirico-adaptive
"
(a good sensate expression, according to Sorokin)
13 may be substituted
for "
logico-meaningful/' The type is empirical, since it contains, in the main, elements which do not necessarily have any
causal-functional relationship to one another, and it is adaptive, since the heterogeneous elements that go into the formation of a cultural pattern must often be modified in the process in
order to coexist. In other words, they become, to quote Max
Weber, interdependent but they are not functions of one another.
Sorokin, with many other sociological theorists, does not reckon adequately with the fact that every cultural complex is
itself a microcosm, in which opposing factors are constantly meeting and clashing, so that sometimes one, sometimes its
opposite, prevails. Despite warnings which he himself utters, from time to time, against over-emphasizing the integration of cultures, he frequently falls into the trap and stresses it himself.
However, it cannot be too strongly insisted that integration of
a culture is not necessarily a good thing. Perfect integration
of a personality leads to stagnation of that personality. Prac
tically all great men, and certainly all geniuses have been very poorly integrated. It is precisely the friction and conflict between imperfectly balanced or harmonized elements in a man's
mental make-up which may lead to innovations and discoveries.
Real greatness often emerges from profound spiritual or intel
lectual travail. A placid, bovine mind may be exceedingly well
integrated at a low level; a gifted demagogue may enjoy perfect
nervous and mental health, with few conscientious scruples or
intellectual struggles to prevent him from employing his talents
to personal advantage and to public disaster in other words,
he is well integrated at a higher level. The same is true, mutatis
mutandis, of groups and nations. A group may be so completely integrated that it exhibits little internal friction, a high degree
of efficiency in accomplishing its purposes, together with selfsufficiency and smugness but it will accomplish little of value
for the world. The early Christians were certainly not well
integrated as a group, since it required centuries for them to



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 69
come to a temporary agreement on normative theological doc
trines and social policies yet few will dispute their potential
capacities for good. Modern Jewish intellectual circles are generally as fine examples as can be found in history of lack of
integration, yet they are producing an astonishingly high proportion of the significant intellectual achievements of our age. It is even possible that the greatest advances in any group are
made when that group is in the highest state of excitation that can be attained without disaster to the group. All this obviously
means that there is most likely to be progress within a group
when that group contains an optimum number of polar ele
ments, i. e., of elements standing in real or potential opposition to one another. Nine-tenths of the bulk of Sorokin's work, as far as it has
appeared, is devoted to the statistical and analytical survey of
the fields of art (painting, sculpture, architecture, music, literature), the history of thought, science and technology, ethics
and juridical theory, systems of social relationship, government
and political theory, economic conditions, incidence of war and
revolution, types of personality and behavior. He selects such concrete illustrations of his principles as the statistical relation in different periods between ideational (conceptual) and visual
(perceptual) painting and the chronological incidence of nudity
in art (to illustrate the sensate type) . From elaborate statistical
tables of such material he obtains data for constructing curves showing both the fluctuation of types in the past 2500 years
and the tendency of various elements to vary concomitantly. In general Sorokin shows good judgment in selecting subjects for statistical treatment and his analysis of sources of error is
often excellent. On the other hand, collection of the material has obviously been affected by many sources of error, some of them due to inexperience of the collector (often a student) and some due to onesidedness of the available material. However, it is probable that errors will cancel out so often that the results
are not seriously vitiated. There can be no doubt that the results
of this gigantic undertaking are very worth-while, whatever weaknesses there may be in detail and these are many!
Sorokin has statistically proved that Western civilization shows
a fundamental tendency toward oscillation, an oscillation which



70 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
is illustrated in hundreds o different ways. As he observes,
however, this principle is not new, but was clearly enunciated
by Vico over two centuries ago. Moreover, every thinking man is well aware of the constant oscillation between such phe
nomena as war and peace, prosperity and depression, conser
vatism and desire to change, mechanism and vitalism, rational
ism and anti-rationalism. To be sure, the resulting picture is made very one-sided by Sorokin's careful selection of only those
phenomena that show clear oscillation, leaving out the opposite
ones of which there are many. It is made much more misleading by failure to point out that the oscillations in question are in large part due to the fact that Western civilization has
become a more and more composite thing, containing within itself so many opposing racial, national, religious, economic, and intellectual tendencies and movements that the resultant
is much more likely a priori to show a pulsating curve than any other kind, unless one selects (as Sorokin has not done) factors which do shift in one general direction. In short, Sorokin, like Toynbee, has demonstrated the obvious, an achievement which is much more useful than it may sound when put so bluntly,
since many historians and philosophers devote much of their
energy to denying or minimizing the obvious.
B. CURRENT ASPECTS OF HISTORICAL DETERMINISM
Innumerable efforts have been made to find a single key with which to unlock the mysteries of history. Some theorists have
drawn on physics and mechanics, some on biology, some on
geography, some on climatic change, others on racial, or physi
ological, or pathological, or economic, or societal, or psychological, or other decisive factors to explain the formation and
differentiation of cultures. We have neither space nor need to
dwell even briefly on all these hypotheses. Moreover, Sorokin has given an admirable detailed criticism of the various classes
of historico-sociological determinism in his Contemporary So
ciological Theories (1929), where he devotes over 750 pages to them, mentioning almost every scholar of the slightest
importance who had maintained either a deterministic or an anti-deterministic position prior to that year. Thanks to him
we can restrict ourselves here to a few observations on points



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 71
which he has not treated at all or has not sufficiently elucidated
for our purposes. Since we shall discuss the validity of
mechanical and biological approaches to the philosophy of
history briefly in section D, we need not deal with them here.
We shall also dispense with any discussion of certain new but
fantastic forms of biological determinism, such as the extra
ordinary development of racist theories since 1933, the attribution of fabulous powers to the endocrine glands as a result of
underlying chemical or other factors, and the like. These specu
lations are either rejected by all competent and independent
scientists or are too extravagant to be taken seriously. The
interpretation of material cultures by their political or religious
aspects is now so infrequent that we can disregard it, in spite
of Max Weber's partly correct explanation of modern European
capitalism as an outgrowth of Calvinistic culture. We shall select three types of determinism for brief discussion: geographical, climatic and economic.
It is, of course, quite idle to deny the tremendous importance
of geographical environment for human history. But the effect of such environment on peoples with different organization or
cultural preparation is often entirely different. White Europeans have succeeded where American Indians failed over a
test period of many thousand years. European Jews are now succeeding in the establishment of a flourishing agricultural population in the low-lying plains and river valleys of Palestine, where the Arabs, with inadequate organization and medical
science, had failed completely over a period of more than a
millennium. Arnold Toynbee's remarkable studies, to which we have referred above, have demonstrated with the utmost clarity that historical and cultural achievements are sometimes greatest where environmental conditions seem to be most unfavor
able. The geographical factor, important as it is, can seldom be used alone as an explanation of cultural phenomena, but must
usually be taken together with other factors and it is a mathe
matical commonplace that results become more and more uncertain as the number of variables increases.
The climatic factor in history has received disproportionate
attention during the past quarter-century, owing to the indefa
tigable efforts of Ellsworth Huntington. Since 1900 he has



72 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
been busily engaged in geographical exploration in Asia Minor,
Central Asia, Iran, Palestine, Central America, and elsewhere,
supplementing it by statistical studies and investigations on
climate and health, industry, achievement, etc. On the basis of this material he has developed an elaborate theory of cyclic
changes in rainfall and temperature, ultimately supposed to be caused by variations in solar radiation and magnetic action.
Owing to his great activity and industry, and to the enormous
mass of data which he has accumulated in support of his
theories, Huntington has exerted increasing influence on geographers, sociologists, and historians; and in many circles his views
are regarded as authoritative. With the assistance of archae
ology and dendro-chronology (tree-ring computations) , he has built up an elaborate theory of climatic periodicity, with long
and short variations in the amplitude of cycles. The short cycles are familiar to all students of weather reports and tree
ring graphs; the long ones are deduced mainly from historical
and archaeological data. According to Huntington, regions
which were once densely peopled and are now abandoned
illustrate the cyclic theory: they were inhabited because they had heavier rainfall and they have been abandoned because the rainfall has been reduced for centuries. Great migrations of
peoples are to be explained by progressive desiccation of semidesert regions; each successive period of drying up led to a
nomadic eruption. Semitic scholars like L. Caetani have made a great deal of the supposed inaridamento of Arabia as an
explanation for periodic migrations from the desert. According
to Huntington and Caetani the Moslem conquest of south
western Asia was primarily nothing but a result of progressive desiccation, which reached a point where Arabia had to dis
gorge its nomads into the surrounding fertile regions. In his
Palestine and its Transformation (1912) Huntington made a great deal of the climatic cycle as a key to the history of Israel.
Unhappily for Huntington's elaborate conclusions, he has based his system throughout on false premises and on induction
from wrongly observed facts. So far as the present writer
knows, not a single competent scholar who is both archaeologist
and historian has adopted his views. It is impossible to accept



TOWARD AN URGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 73
any o his many lines of evidence, mostly based on personal
observations, which converge to demonstrate his thesis with
respect to Palestine. He points to the Roman-Byzantine cities of the Negeb in southern Palestine, where there is not a single village today, as proof that there was then heavier rainfall than
there is today. The excavations of the Colt Expedition since
1933 have shown that the cities of the Negeb flourished at
different times during a period of nearly a millennium, so that
there were apparently never more than one or two large towns at a time. Moreover, all these towns were built on important
caravan routes, in an age when trade by land from Arabia to
Palestine and Egypt was at its very height. Almost every house
had one or two cisterns and there were reservoirs on every side,
with dry dams at the head of every suitable valley near a town. Some of these considerations and others convinced Woolley
and Lawrence in 191413 that Huntington's theory was wrong, but even they took for granted that the total population at one
time must have been much larger than we now know to have
been the case. At the oasis of Engedi Huntington found many
abandoned water channels which convinced him that there must have been much more water available in the Roman period.
Competent investigation of the southern basin of the Dead Sea
has since shown that the many abandoned water channels in all oases in this region are simply due to the fact that after
several years of irrigation an irrigated section must be abandoned because of the formation of a crust of alkali over the
surface of the soil. If the soil is left to itself for a generation or more the occasional winter rains will wash the alkali away and make further irrigation possible. Hence the rotation of irrigated terrains and with it the constant shifting of water channels. The same kind of superficial and erroneous observation is char
acteristic of all Huntington's work. At Jerash, for example, he regarded the stadium as an arena which could be flooded with
water for mimic naval combats (naumachy) and believed that
the ancient inhabitants were entirely dependent on the water of the stream which flows through it. Actually the excavations there since 1928 have shown that the site is honeycombed by cisterns, constructed in order to supplement the supply of the
Chrysorhoas.
1* In the Palmyrene he completely overlooked the



74 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
existence of an elaborate system of subterranean aqueducts, called juqur by the Arabs, which are found all over southwestern Asia in regions physically suited for them. It has been amply demonstrated in recent years that Huntington's observations are equally misleading wherever they have been made: in Central Asia (where the rivers have changed their courses and where there are ruins of very elaborate irrigation works), in Central America (where he completely mis
understood the physiographic and archaeological situation),
and elsewhere. Nor can a single really competent geographer
be found who accepts his conclusions. In passing, however, it must be emphasized that his elaborate hypotheses have set
scientists and historians to thinking, and have thus been of
considerable heuristic value to science as a whole, in spite of
their ephemeral character.
We should not take up economic determinism here at all,
since it has been adequately dealt with by Sorokin. Above
(p. 55) we have had occasion to mention the vagaries of the
Marxist interpretation of ancient history. However, economic determinism has enjoyed such an unexampled vogue in recent American literature that a vigorous protest against it is neces
sary.
15 The importance of the economic factor is very great
just as great as that of the closely related geographical one but
it must not be over-emphasized. The history of religious life in the Near East is full of individuals and movements which
challenge the principle. When the Israelites fled from Egypt
into the desert they were not seeking food and comfort but freedom and opportunity to serve their God. Prophets like
Elijah and Jeremiah were not looking for a chance to better
their economic status. The Rechabites would doubtless have
been much more prosperous, not to say comfortable, if they
had abandoned their semi-nomadic way of life and had settled
down and used their frugality and their high code of morals
for economic self-improvement. Modern history is full of
parallel examples.
As a counterpoise to these serious, though exaggerated,
theories we may be pardoned for saying a word about a futile but widely read example of psychological determinism Freud's
Moses and Monotheism (1939) . This book is simply the latest



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 75
of a long train of books and papers on history and religion
which have been issued by Freud himself and by other members
of the psycho-analytical school during the past generation. Like
them his new book is totally devoid of serious historical method and deals with historical data even more cavalierly than with
the data of introspective and experimental psychology.16
C. THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF HISTORY
The problem of the source and validity of historical knowl
edge has been raised increasingly by philosophers and historians
in the past generation. To what extent is historical knowledge
basically distinct from scientific knowledge? 17 To what extent
does history reflect opinion and propaganda rather than objec
tive fact? There are two opposing schools of thought with
regard to the answer brought to each question. Thanks to two
important books which have recently appeared, Maurice Mandel
baum's The Problem of Historical Knowledge (1938) and
Raymond Aron's study of German historical theory entitled
La philosophie critique de I'histoire (also 1938), we are in a
much more favorable position to discuss these elusive and com
plex questions than we were previously, since the extensive
German literature on the subject is very difficult to cover with
out losing one's way.
The current opinion, held by most philosophers and his
torians, both relativists and positivists, is that there is a funda
mental difference between historical and scientific knowledge.
Henri Berr and Lucien Febvre say: "While physical phe
nomena would be known even without the intervention of someone to describe and classify them, the historical past exists only to the extent that there is an image of it in other
words, to the extent that it is recreated by the mind." 18 Mandel
baum is more logical:
" The historian deals with specific events which once occurred in a certain place, and he seeks to delineate
the nature of those events. The natural scientist, on the other
hand, formulates judgments regarding 'typical* occurrences, establishing the relation which those occurrences bear to certain
of the conditions under which they appear." The statement of Berr and Febvre is very strange and can hardly be defended by any epistemologist in the form in which



76 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
it is put, which describes natural science from the standpoint of realism and history from that of nominalism. Physical phe
nomena doubtless exist without the intervention of some person
to observe them, but they are certainly not known to man unless
man is present when they transpire and is able to recognize
them as they transpire. Moreover, past physical phenomena
cannot be directly known either, but require the intervention of
some indirect instrumentality of cognition. Exactly the same is true in principle of history: current historical phenomena are
known to those who are in a position to recognize or to com
prehend them; the historical past can be known only through the intervention of an indirect instrumentality of cognition. Of course, it would be idle to deny that there is a real difference
in practice, for the historian is generally interested in past his
torical events of specific character, while the scientist is usually searching for contemporary evidence on which to formulate
natural laws of general application. But this intrinsic practical difference has led thinkers to postulate a drastic theoretical
difference which simply does not exist, as we shall see. Mandelbaum's definition of the difference between historical
and scientific thinking is superior to the one just discussed, but it is also inadequate. Since the primary function of the historian
is to collect as many facts as possible about the past and
present of man (for the past cannot be understood without
knowledge of the present), archaeological facts are entirely within the proper domain of the historian, even though he may
have to leave their collection and part of their interpretation
to the specialist. These facts, which cover the entire past of humanity, so far as it has been preserved and can be recon
structed, are tangible and contemporary, since they may be
handled and can be verified by visits to museums and by ex
amination of excavation reports and archaeological handbooks.
The physical and material past of man can thus be recovered by
substantially the same methods as are used in geology, palae
ontology, palaeobotany, and related fields. From the epistemo
logical point of view archaeological data are just as contempo
rairy as are the facts gathered laboriously by astronomers
through telescopes and spectroscopes, since the latter are also tangible records of events which transpired in the past some



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 77
times many millions o light-years ago. The historian of human
culture is, moreover, just as much interested in discovering
general laws as is the natural scientist, since every single phase
of past and present culture has its own pattern of constituent
elements. In a given group of sites or deposits from the same
age and region, the archaeologist always recovers pottery and
other human artifacts of the same types. There is some varia
tion, of course, but the limits of variation are always subject to
approximate definition which is all that can be expected of
most corresponding phenomena in the natural sciences. If we
rise in the scale to mental phenomena, we find a given language or dialect in all documents belonging to a given region and
period. This applies equally, as we have seen, to documents recovered by the archaeologist and to documents preserved in
libraries. Furthermore, if we study these documents we find that each period and region or group has similar habits of thought,
forms of organization, and types of economic and religious life,
etc. The scientific historian is much more interested in estab
lishing and defining these general laws than he is in fixing and relating individual facts, important as the latter are. If it is objected that the scientist endeavors to discover laws of more
general applicability than the ones we have mentioned, one can only point out that the primary purpose of the botanist and
zoologist, for example, is to establish the laws governing the life of individual species, of which there are millions. Similarly
the chemist devotes much of his energy to discovering the prin
ciples governing the activity of each compound of which there
are untold millions. Astronomers must study individual phe
nomena in Mars or the Moon before they are justified in devoting themselves to astro-physical studies. There is, accord
ingly, no basic epistemological difference between comparable fields of history and of science.
The principal reason for the failure of philosophers to
recognize this fact more fully is that they have limited the
definition of history too sharply. The historian of man is as
justified, however, in beginning his research with the fundamental facts of man's social life as the physicist is warranted in
beginning with basic physical data, or as the biologist is in commencing with elementary phenomena of living organisms.



78 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Just as these data lead to a principle of universal validity, such
as gravitation or unicellular life, so the historian arrives at
the basic principle of human societal life, which is quite as
immutable. As we ascend the hierarchic scale from plane to
plane of variability, our laws become progressively less general
and less binding or more uncertain in both history and sci
ence until we reach a plane where the number of variables
make prediction impossible, as far as the finite mind can tell.
In the social sciences we reach this plane much more rapidly
than in the physical sciences, but the basic modes of reasoning are the same. Mandelbaum has cogently distinguished between
two types of historical judgments which he calls "
judgments of
fact " and "
judgments of value." We would add a third type,
"
judgments of typical occurrence/' where the data are, as a rule, quite as objectively ascertainable as they are in many fields of natural science. Illustrations of such typical occurrences in
history have already been given above. If the objection be raised that some fields of natural science have a higher logical standard, since many of their laws can be stated in mathematical
terms, we reply that there is only a relative, not an absolute
difference, since statistics and chronology play a dominant role
in many branches of physics and chemistry, just as they do in biology and in history. It is again primarily a difference in the degree of variability and not in logical method.
Before we leave this subject, it may be well to stress the difference in historical certainty between the actions of groups
and of individuals. Archaeology and the history of civilization
have proved that the material, social, and mental characteristics of a given culture are relatively stable and can generally be
fixed with a decreasing margin of error as social organization
becomes more primitive and less self-conscious or sophisticated.
On the other hand, there is no way of telling how an individual will react within the limits set by environment and education.
It is, for example, impossible for men to judge the inner motives
of any superior acquaintance. Consequently, biography is an art
and not properly an historical discipline, though the conscien
tious biographer will spare no pains to make the external facts of his subject's life as accurate as possible. This principle has
been very effectively stressed by the school of Strachey, Maurois,



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 79
Nicolson and Ludwig, though some members o the group seem
to believe that they can closely approach absolute historical
correctness by clever application o this or that system of psy
chology. 19 Moreover, the reaction of a group cannot be pre
dicted if too many or too elusive variable factors are involved,
or if a group is under the influence of a superior personality of
unpredictable character. This is why a history of civili2ation, in any of its aspects, may possess scientific accuracy, whereas a narrative of past events may be colored by the opinions of past
narrators and a causal-functional history of movements may be
thoroughly misleading.
D. SOME FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING HISTORY
Without losing ourselves in detail we shall now undertake
to point out the extent to which principles of mathematics, of
the physical sciences, of biology, and of anthropology are
applicable to history. Mathematical and mechanical principles
may safely be assumed to have universal applicability within
the limits of their operation, which is not so wide nor so rigorous as was believed before the discovery of relativity and of the character of mathematics as an indefinite number of frames
of reference. Since these principles are merely forms of pure
logic, such general applicability may be postulated with all
reasonable confidence. The historical and sociological configura
tions, however, to which they are applied are less rigid than
physical configurations; and consequently the application must,
as a rule, be made in the form of analogy rather than of
rigorous demonstration. "
Every action is followed by an equal
and opposite reaction," but the reaction becomes mechanically
intangible unless it can be measured and historical reactions
can seldom be measured with any approach to precision. Yet the fact of a reaction is generally certain. Similarly, Vico's
principle of corsi e ricorsi (fluxes and refluxes) is mechanically
sound and has been adopted by Croce and Sorokin as normative
to their systems. One is justified in employing such terms as
continuum, integration, frame of reference, orbit, centrifugal
or tangential movement, operational method, etc., provided
only that one fully recognizes the limitations of their use and



80 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
does not attempt to deduce binding conclusions from their
analogical application. In this connection it may be observed
that Hegel's triad,
"
thesis, antithesis, synthesis," introduces an idea of limited mathematical and physical application, and has proved as miserable a failure in history as in natural science,
in spite of its undoubted classificatory value.
Turning from mathematico-physical to biological principles
of significance to the historian, we are immediately aware of
the increasing rigor with which they can be employed, since man
and society are both biologically controlled. We can safely use
such ideas as organism, life cycle, and species, as long as we remember that society is not really an organism in Durkheim's sense, but that it merely acts as an organism under certain
conditions. A societal organism is just as much an abstraction
as a centrifugal tendency is. Similarly, every organized human group is born, grows, declines, and dies, as it must if it is an
aggregation of individual living beings. Every known biological
organism and cultural group of the past has died, so we are
justified in expecting every similar organism and grouping of the future to die. Evolution and mutation are other exceedingly
valuable biological concepts which may be applied to history,
and both are illustrated by innumerable facts known largely as
the result of archaeological investigation. Orthogenesis is a very fertile heuristic principle in history, illustrated by many
cogent facts, such as the success of well-integrated movements which continue to develop in the direction of their early evolu
tion and the corresponding failure of most sectarian offshoots, and by the abnormal results which indefinite evolution along a certain line may have (as in the Hindu caste system).
Emergent evolution is another productive idea. In dealing with historical evolution there are many seductive errors of method
into which historians have been beguiled by insufficient facts
or by inadequate perspective. For example, the sequence of evolution is sometimes reversed and vestigial features are considered as rudimentary, as in certain studies of typological
development in archaeology. Then, again, evolution may be
telescoped into an impossibly brief period, as has been done by the Wellhausen school in reconstructing the development of
the religion of Israel or by Breasted in dating the dawn of



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 81
conscience. Evolution is not always homogeneous in human
history in fact the reverse is probably more common, as in the
development of Egyptian civilization, for example. In general,
it may perhaps be said that a homogeneous, evenly balanced evolution is just as likely in disturbed areas, as in ancient
Palestine, where a given society is more open to outside in
fluences and to equalizing currents, as in a relatively isolated land like Egypt.
When we come to consider the applicability of principles of
anthropology we are in a different situation, since anthropology
is simply one aspect of history (or the reverse) . Here our most urgent problem is to determine the correctness of anthropo
logical principles before applying them to history proper.
Principles which have been ascertained by the physical anthro
pologist or the ethnologist to be true usually prove of great direct value to the historian, and particularly to the historian
of antiquity, where conditions most closely parallel those of
"
primitive
"
peoples today. The reverse is equally true, since
the anthropologist is faced with many problems of a general type which he cannot solve with his present data, as, for
example, the question of the age of the belief in a supreme
deity of abstract nature, the age and source of myths or other
elements of culture. The old problem of cultural diffusion
versus the principle of Volkergedanken (where both sides are partly right), the question of the primary or secondary char
acter of totemism when compared to the socio-religious organi
zation of Egypt in the fourth millennium, and many similar
ones demand solution and solution can only come through the joint efforts of the cultural anthropologist and the historian of
antiquity. Is the modern savage degenerate or simply stagnant?
Was primitive man more or less inventive than his modern
representative? How far must puzzling cultural and social
phenomena be traced to adaptation or skeuomorphism? e. g.,
is the appearance of clothing in warm regions to be traced to the
southward migration of northern peoples with the established
custom of wearing some clothing as a protection against cold?
To what extent can we speak of spontaneous
" folklore," or is
folklore in reality the residue of literature, systematic teachings,
or miscellaneous information which has percolated down



82 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
through society from the elite at the top ? as Norman Brown has shown to be the case with the allegedly popular oral litera
ture of modern India.20 It will be recognized at once that problems of this kind are most important for the correct under
standing of antiquity, as well as of many phases of more
recent history.
E. TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
Having stated our approach to the epistemology of history
and to the use of analogy from other scientific domains, we can
sketch, with a clear conscience, our own attitude to certain basic
questions of the philosophy of history an attitude which will
profoundly influence our interpretation of the meaning of the
data contained in the following pages. The data themselves and their historical context are not affected by the interpretation
which we may give them, since they have been scrupulously
checked by the methods described and analyzed in Chapter I. But the interpretation of these data and contexts, as materials
for the historical panorama which we reconstruct, is undoubtedly
affected by our philosophy of history, just as is true of the work
of every philosophically minded historian of the past.
To what extent is it possible to create a grandiose synthesis of history, in the fashion of Hegel, of Spengler, or in a sense
of Sorokin? It is difficult to say, since the climax of human history remains in the hands of God, and interpretations of His
will by theologians are quite as divergent as are similar interpre
tations of history by non-theologians. We know enough today,
however, to be able fully to cover many features of human
history in diagrammatic form. The following table will illustrate what can be done in a broad way, with reference to the
relation between undifferentiated, differentiated, and integrated culture.
First Stage Prehistoric Undifferenti- Early and Middle
ated Culture Palaeolithic Second Stage Prehist. Partially Differ- Late Palaeolithic entiated Culture to Chalcolithic Third Stage Historic Differentiated Cir. 3000-400 B. C. Culture with Centre in the Near East

sive World Sweep of
West
This classification is naturally arbitrary and no single stage is invulnerable to serious criticism. It is simply presented to
illustrate the present writer's view of the possibilities. Will
the next great stage be an integrated culture or will it be a return to prehistoric lack of differentiation between cultures? From the standpoint of the present study, this table reflects
the writers conviction that the Graeco-Roman civilization of
the time of Christ represented the closest approach to a rational
unified culture that the world has yet seen and may justly be
taken as the culmination of a long period of relatively steady
evolution. It was in the fifth century B. C that we find the
greatest single burst of intellectual and aesthetic activity that
the world has ever known, with results unparalleled before or after, from the standpoint of the integral achievement of
man as intellectual, aesthetic, and physical animal Small wonder that such great geneticists as Galton and Bateson have
expressed their conviction that the climax of human evolution
was reached by the Attic Greeks in the fifth century B.C.!
It was, moreover, about the same time that the religion of
Israel reached its climactic expression in Deutero-Isaiah and Job,
who represented a height beyond which pure ethical monothe
ism has never risen. The history of Israelite and Jewish religion from Moses to Jesus thus appears to stand on the pinnacle
of biological evolution as represented in Homo Sapiens, and
recent progress in discovery and invention really reflects a
cultural lag of over two millennia, a lag which is, to be sure,
very small when compared to the hundreds of thousands of



84 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
years during which man has been toiling up the steep slopes of evolution. Another broad classification o human history may be made on the basis of man's mental achievement, as represented by
the highest religious and literary accomplishments of his his
toric past, seen in the perspective of the modern contrast
between primitive tribes and civilized nations. This progress
begins at an unknown time in the Stone Age with prelogical,
corporative thinking, to use Levy-Bruhl's terminology (see
below) . With the Greeks in the fifth century B. C. we may say
that the logical age of man begins, though it is quite true that
the uneducated man often remains at bottom the same prelogical, corporative thinker as his remote forefathers and
savage cousins. The intervening stage is represented by the ancient Near East from the third millennium to the fifth
century B. C. Here men start, as we shall see, with a prelogical, corporative tradition and after the late third millennium pro
gressively discard prelogical thought and enter the empirical
stage of logical thinking, where the highest thought is quite logical as a rule, but draws its sanctions from the results of experience and not from formal canons of thinking. Almost
simultaneously we see the individual beginning to receive
formal recognition in religion and literature, with personal responsibility proclaimed for the first time in ethical teaching.
Personalism tends to replace corporatism. It is significant that no fundamental change in man's highest achievement in modes of thought can be detected after the fifth century B. C. For
the past 2500 years civilized man has thought in much the same fundamental ways, as is vividly illustrated by the oscilla
tions between " ideational " and "
sensate," or " mixed "
types of culture which have been statistically and analytically established by Sorokin.
Turning from these broad horizons, where a single subjective dislocation can disorganize an historian's entire perspective, to
firmer ground, we wish to state our conviction that an inductive
organismic philosophy is the only proper way in which to approach the problem of the relation of historical contexts to
one another. And this organismic basis must be, as we pointed
out in discussing Toynbee's system, a modest one, not rising for



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 85
operational purposes beyond the level o the culture-unit. By
this we mean a geographically and chronologically limited hori
zon, in which there is a real homogeneity about the aspect o
any element or factor, which ceases as soon as we cross these
boundaries of space and time. Our European civilization is so
complex and is so continuously modified in all directions by the
influence of its many cultural centres that one who examines it
too closely and exclusively, as is the case with Sorokin, fails dearly to grasp the real existence of sharply defined cultures in
the ancient Orient as well as among more recent primitive
peoples. To the archaeologist these cultures are tangible reali
ties; to the linguist and anthropologist the same is true. The average historian, however, immersed in the study of complex
higher cultures, often fails to see what seems so transparent to
his colleagues. Actually, the historian of the West has just as
adequate evidence of patterns and configurations of culture, though they are never as clear, owing to the complexity of the
pattern of occidental civilization into which they are woven.
When one culture yields to another there is nearly always
(probably always under simple conditions) an abrupt change,
a true mutation of culture, in which a generation may suffice
for changes which might otherwise take a millennium to effect. In the ancient Orient, for example, a culture may last for
centuries with only the slightest modification, after which there
is a sudden interruption in its continuity, accompanied by changes so rapid that it is often hard for the archaeologist to
distinguish the successive steps. The cultural revolution is then
followed by a new culture or cultural phase, which may last
again for centuries with little internal change. What is true of
simple cultures is likewise true, mutatis mutandis, of patterns
of nomistic religion, etc. There was an abrupt break between
Judaism and Christianity in the first century A. D., followed by nearly two thousand years in which Judaism and Christianity themselves have changed but little, considering the magnitude
of the original break between them. Protestantism is not a new
religion, but simply an effort to return to early Christianity by discarding most of the results of nearly 1500 years of slow
development; and all Protestant leaders were formerly con
vinced that their systems reflected early Christianity as dosely as



86 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
possible, given the changed environment of the West. Bud
dhism and Islam similarly represent abrupt breaks with the past,
following which the standard forms of these faiths have changed but little, except for reformations like the Wahhabi movement, designed to restore primitive simplicity of faith and
practice. It is the present writer's firm conviction, based on historical evidence which will be duly marshalled in Chapter IV,
that Mosaism represents the same type of abrupt break with
the past, of evolutionary mutation. Like Christianity and Islam,
Mosaism changed slowly but surely in the following genera
tions, until gradual evolution was violently interrupted by the
Prophetic movement, which may be compared to the Wahhabi
movement or the Protestant Reformation with respect to the
seal of its protagonists and their desire to restore primitive
Mosaism. It was partly successful in eliminating elements
which it considered abuses and wholly successful in restoring
Israelite piety, so it may well be compared with the Catholic
Counter-reformation, which also succeeded in reforming numer
ous abuses without breaking up the Church.
It is, in the writer's judgment, a serious methodical error to
assume that all the various elements of any " authentic " culture
are linked together either in a causal-functional or in a "
logicomeaningful
"
way, a la Sorokin. Of course, there are elements
which are causally and functionally related to one another, but this is probably not true of all. Our standpoint is rather that
a culture represents an empirico-adaptive system, in which ele
ments have been brought together as a result of many quite dis
similar causes, but where they are adapted to one another by a
process which reminds one of the unconscious ability of any
man to make the products of his multifarious and often incon
gruous genes work together in tolerable harmony. These inner
bonds are, in general, quite secondary and no amount of intuitive guessing is likely to reveal them. However, the more we
can establish the existence of causal and functional as well as
of purely empirical relationships, the better we shall under
stand history and sociology. In this respect we agree entirely
with Max Weber.
In concluding these observations, it may be emphasized that organismic philosophy inevitably carries with it opposition,



TOWARD AN ORGANISMIC PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 87
open or implicit, to monistic or atomistic speculations. Thinkers
who deal habitually with patterns, configurations, and organisms cannot help but raise the question of entelechy, whatever
form the question may take. If patterns and organisms have
properties which none of the component units possesses, does
not the Cosmos likewise have properties which raise it high
above its most impressive constituent? If microcosmic man,
who alone of created beings is able to think consciously and purposively, is forced by circumstances over which he may have
little control to become one of a group which plays a definite
role in a larger pattern, itself perhaps a unit in a still larger
configuration, does not the human microcosm have its analogy
in a macrocosmic thinker who is above these configurations of
human societies ? The student of natural science, where amoral
law reigns supreme except where its rule is contested by the
principle of indeterminacy, may answer in the negative. The
student of modern history, mindful of its superficially meaningless oscillations and its frequent confusion of thought, may
also answer in the negative. The sympathetic student of man's
entire history can have but one reply: there is an Intelligence
and a Will, expressed in both History and Nature 21 for History and Nature are one.



CHAPTER III
PRAEPARATIO
In this chapter we shall describe the cultural and religious
evolution of the Near East from the earliest ages to about 1600 B. C. Since the purpose of the present work is not to recount
political history except in so far as it throws direct light on the
development of higher religious culture, we shall lay stress on
the evolution of civilization through successive cultures, and
especially on the unfolding of religious phenomena. Owing to
the extraordinary progress in our knowledge of the most ancient
Near East in the past ten years, we may advance beyond our
predecessors and construct a fresh synthesis, based directly on
archaeological material, both written and unwritten. We are
forced by new discoveries to diverge farthest from previous historians in the reconstruction of the successive cultures of the Stone Age and the following transitional period, the Chalco
lithic or Ceramolithic,1 about which very little was known ten years ago. In dealing with the historical period from 3000 to
1600 B. C. our new knowledge is of special importance for
chronology, and we can now fix dates and correlate the chro
nologies of Egypt and Mesopotamia with an approach to pre
cision which was unknown a decade ago.2 The Sumerian age in
Mesopotamia has been brightly illuminated by recent dis
coveries; the Dynasty of Accad has become historically and culturally tangible; the age of Amorite domination has emerged
from obscurity into an important place in history; Bronze-Age
Palestine and Syria are now better known than their Iron Age
was a decade ago.
A. THE EVOLUTION OF MATERIAL CIVILIZATION IN THE NEAR
EAST FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY B. C.
1. The Stone Age
Thanks to the extraordinary progress of our knowledge of
the Stone Age in the Near East, as briefly described above
(pp. 3 .), we can now present a correct chronological outline 88



PRAEPARATIO 89
of the succession of human types and cultures, though there
are still numerous minor gaps to be filled and much funda
mental knowledge of the earlier phases is entirely wanting.
No certain eolithic remains have been discovered and the Early Palaeolithic remains obscure, in spite of surface finds. Palestine
and other highland regions of Western Asia have yielded surface stations of Chellean and Acheulian type, but it is only in Egypt that flint artifacts of these ages have been discovered in characteristic geological formations. In the Nile Valley there is
a series of high gravel terraces which roughly parallel the present course of the Nile and which follow approximately the
same gradient as the modern river. In the highest of them, the
100-foot terrace, the British archaeologists Sandford and Arkell, working on behalf of the Oriental Institute, have collected a
respectable number of Chellean flints. The following, or 50
foot, terrace similarly yields Adieuiian flints. This geological
sequence is confirmed by Fr. Bovier-Lapierre's discovery of the same stratigraphical order in gravel beds near Cairo; the lowest or Chellean deposits here also contain characteristic early
Pleistocene fossils. Owing to the extraordinary complexity of
the observed phenomena, which seems to increase year by year,
there is still no assured correlation between the successive glacial
and inter-glacial phases of Central Europe, the raised beaches
of the Mediterranean, the Nile terraces, and the pluvial phases
of the Jordan Valley. While it is now certain that the former conservative dating of the Chellean of Europe in the third
Interglacial (the Riss-Wiirm phase) was too low and that the
Chellean must be dated back to the Second or even to the First
Interglacial, with Breuil and others, a more precise relative
chronology is still unattainable. The great advances made in
the chronology of solar radiation since the World War (Mi
lankovitch, Koppen, and others) have been so successfully correlated with the glacial oscillations of the Pleistocene by F.
Zeuner (since 1935) that we can be reasonably sure of the
approximate absolute chronology, especially since his results
coincide rather closely with the estimates previously made by
Penck and Bruckner on the basis of the rate of erosion.3 That
the magnitude of individual stages is roughly correct is also
proved by Count de Geer's geochronological work in Sweden



90 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
and by recent estimates of the time required to deposit the annual laminations of the Lisan terrace in the Jordan Valley
(Blake: 40,000 years, Picard: materially less). We need not concern ourselves here with the latest objections to the Zeuner theory, based on the fact that increased solar radiation auto
matically increases the rate of evaporation, which raises the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere and reduces the
effect of radiation, since this principle merely brings in a new factor of retardation in addition to those previously known.
The important point for us to know is that the oldest stone
artifacts so far found in the Near East, of characteristically Chellean type, cannot be less than 200,000 years old and may
possibly be much older. Very little is known about Near
Eastern man at this stage, since the earliest traces of cave
dwelling do not appear until later.
Toward the end of the Early Palaeolithic Age in the middle
or late Acheulian (Tayacian) , perhaps about 150,000 years ago,
appear the first cave deposits of human origin in Palestine.
Deposits of this general age have been found by Dorothy Garrod and by R. Neuville in a number of caves in different parts of Palestine. At that time the severity of climatic condi
tions in the first phase of the Third Glacial Age (according to
Breuil, whose view on the subject is generally accepted) forced
Acheulian man to take refuge in caves and to make his abode in them. Having formed the habit he continued to live partly
in caves even during warmer interglacial or interpluvial periods. In the early part of Middle Palaeolithic, many thousands of
years after the beginning of the cave-dwelling age, when nearly
forty feet of debris had accumulated during periods of living
in the Mugharet et-Tabun near Mount Carmel, the bodies of a dozen persons were left in this cave and a neighboring one. These remains have been carefully removed from the hard limestone matrix in which they were found imbedded, a task
which has taken Sir Arthur Keith and T. D. McCown some five years of hard work; and since 1937 full' accounts of the anthropological study of them have become available.4 Like the Galilee skull, discovered by Turville-Petre in 1925, and like a
group of four skulls discovered in Mugharet el-Qafzeh south of Nazareth in 1934 by R. Neuville, these skeletons belong to



PRAEPARATIO 91
the earlier part of the Levalloiso-Mousterian, and must thus be
at least 100,000 years old, in all probability. All of them belong
to the extinct species known as Neanderthal man (Homo
Neanderthalensis), like all known Mousterian skeletal remains
from Europe and Siberia, but most of the skeletons found near
Carmel show much more racial variation than do European
skeletons of that age. Most important is the fact that the indi
viduals from near Carmel show (with one exception) some
strikingly modern anatomical features, characteristic of Homo
Sapiens from his earliest known appearance in the Aurignacian
of Europe and found in all surviving races of man. This is
usually interpreted to mean that the Near East was a stage in
the journey of Homo Sapiens from his supposed cradle in the
Middle East to Europe; Palestine would thus illustrate the inevitable racial mixture that resulted from the meeting of
Homo Sapiens with Homo Neanderthalensis.
When these men lived human culture had advanced but little
beyond the Chellean level; the principal material distinction lies in the increase both in the number of distinct kinds of stone artifacts which were used and the increased differentiation of types in different regions. In the Chellean there seems to have been very little difference between the artifacts of Egypt and
Palestine and those of France. In the subsequent Tayacian,
Acheulian, and Micoquian, all belonging to the Early Palaeolithic, this is still true, but in the Middle Palaeolithic there is for the first time a marked difference between the stone cultures
of Europe and of Egypt and Palestine, though they may all be
termed " Mousterian " in general terms. This tendency toward cultural differentiation increased steadily in the Late Palaeolithic Palestine parted company from the Sebilian and Capsian
of North Africa and joined the domain of Aurignacian culture which then held sway over most of Europe and the Highland
Zone of Western Asia (Asia Minor, Armenia, and Western
Iran). During the long-continued Aurignacian period there is
no skeletal evidence from the Near East, where there is a
probable gap between the latest cave deposits of Aurignacian
type and the earliest of Mesolithic character. This gap is
bridged in Europe by the Solutrean, Magdalenian, and such
epi-palaeolithic cultures as the Azilian. Until we have more



92 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
evidence in Egypt or in Western Asia it is not safe to make
any inferences with respect to the development of human life
and culture. To judge from European analogies the gap corresponds to a period of at least 10,000 years (minimum date
cir. 20,000-10,000 B. C) in the Near East, during which there
was a remarkable improvement in the arts and crafts, from the
flint artifact itself, which was now specialized in many direc
tions, to the crafts of hunting, fishing, weaving of nets and mats,
and even carving and painting. Turning again to Europe for material to supplement our still
inadequate observations from the Near East, we can say with
reasonable confidence that the Mousterians had already begun
to inter their dead. In the Aurignacian age regular burials became customary and corpses were often buried with ornar ments of shells, teeth, and bone, as well as with flint tools and weapons and with red ochre for painting the body. Of much
more direct importance for us is the discovery, in deposits of clear Aurignacian age, of stone, bone, and ivory reliefs and statuettes of nude women. All are alike in stressing only
breasts, abdomen, navel, and hypogastric region, without any attempt to represent features or even in some cases to indicate
feet and arms. The breasts are invariably heavy and pendulous and the abdomen protrudes in a way which can only indicate a
woman in advanced pregnancy. This impression becomes a cer
tainty when we examine the " Venus " of Willendorf and note
the laterally distended navel, the exaggerated protrusion of the vulvar region, and the fact that the arms are placed over the
breasts as though to press milk out (a proleptic touch), all of which remind us forcibly of later Halafian parallels in
dhalcolithic Mesopotamia. The nudity alone does not warrant
any inference, since the Aurignacians had not yet learned how
to sew leather, if we may judge from the absence of awls and
needles, and presumably went naked when the temperature permitted. However, Halafian and later analogies, as well as
the dynamistic parallels in Capsian and Magdalenian art, make it evident that these figurines were used as amulets or were at least somewhat comparable to the amulets of later ages, being
used as sympathetic aids to fertility or to easy delivery or
to both.5



PRAEPARATIO 93
In the gap between Aurignacian and Mesolithic in the Near East falls the Magdalenian culture of southwestern Europe,
belonging to the physically superior branch of Homo Sapiens
which we call the Cro-Magnon race. Here the art of painting reached the highest point attained before the fifth millennium
B. C, and in some respects the highest stage reached before
the third millennium. The superb paintings of the walls of
Altamira and other caves in France and Spain are so well known
that no description is necessary; it is also a commonplace that the subjects chosen for execution, various details of treatment,
and above all the extraordinary inaccessibility of many of the
paintings, which are found in chambers and passages only
reached with the greatest effort, must be explained dynamisti.cally. In other words, the animals which are portrayed were
objects of the chase, often represented in slightly later Capsian
rock-drawings as being hunted by men, and the purpose of
representing them was to give the hunter control over them.
The technical excellence of the paintings is alone sufficient
proof that there was a class of men who specialized in this
form of sympathetic magic, which may better be called "
dynamism," to use Bertholet's happy term. Prehistorians have
explained the paintings and other objects of Magdalenian culture as illustrating still more developed religious and cultic practices, but most of their inferences remain quite uncertain.
Returning to the Near East, we find that the Mesolithic Age
is more adequately represented than almost anywhere else in the world, thanks to Miss Garrod's discovery of the Natufian
culture in 1928 and to subsequent finds.6 The past ten years have brought a mass of evidence for this culture from several caves and settlements in Palestine. While it cannot be pre
cisely dated as yet, we can hardly go wrong in placing its end
long before 6000 B. C. A reasonable guess is that it was at its
height about 10,000 years ago. According to R. Neuville, four phases of the Natufian can be distinguished, but there is some
doubt about details as yet. The Natufians were a small, slender,
long-headed people, markedly resembling the earliest pre
dynastic Egyptians and the chalcolithic men of Byblus. In other
words, they belonged to an historical race, probably to the same race from which the Hamites and Semites of later times de



94 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
scended. 7 The only marked difference is in stature and size of
bones, which are notoriously dependent on nutritional and
environmental factors, as is shown by recent biological and
medical observations and experiments. The Natufians had
already learned to grow cereals, presumably an early variety of
millet or wheat, as we know from the discovery of flint sickles
and sickle edges in considerable numbers. On the other hand,
they had not reached the pottery-making stage and there are no
ground edges on their microlithic implements. It is probable that they had learned to domesticate certain animals, though the
evidence is still inconclusive. Artistically they had made con
siderable progress, since several carved statuettes of men and
animals have been found; the best is a superb fawn carved from the end of a bone. They were also able to hollow out and shape stone basins and mortars, as well as to build simple constructions of stone. They buried their dead, laying the body
on its side with legs drawn up, and in certain cases, at least,
leaving ornaments in place. Palestine has also yielded the first certain stratigraphic evidence in the Near East for the next important step forward in culture, the grinding of stone artifacts and the, erection of mas
sive stone structures. This stage has long been known as the
Neolithic in Western Europe, where it lasted much longer, and
the term has often been erroneously applied to various relatively
early cultures of the Near East, nearly all of which have subse
quently turned out to be much later in date. The true Neolithic
(see below, 2) was first discovered in stratigraphic sequence by J. Garstang, in his excavation of the lowest occupied levels at Jericho in 1935-36. This culture, which must antedate the fifth millennium, exhibits two main stages, one before the invention of pottery, the ather after it, being in this respect
somewhat parallel to the Egyptian typological sequence
Faiyumian-Merimdean. The explorations and soundings of R. Neuville have brought to light some of the cultural stages separating the Natufian of Carmel from the pre-ceramic neolithic phase of Jericho, but it is not our purpose here to go into detail. Suffice it to say that the Tahunian I of Neuville is an intermediate culture which closely resembles the Natufian but exhibits the first arrow-heads; there are as yet no ground stone edges of true neolithic type.



PRAEPARATIO 95
The pre-ceramic Neolithic of Jericho is a culture o extra
ordinary interest. Here we find the oldest known permanent
houses; we also find mud figurines of domestic animals and
plastic statues of human beings. The latter occur in groups,
each apparently containing a man, woman, and child; they were
made by smearing gypsiferous clay on a kind of skeleton of
reeds, and though of normal proportions en face are very thin
in profile. The head which Garstang has published is nearly
life-size. These curious groups must have a cultic significance,
since they are otherwise inexplicable. The houses and supposed shrine are also very curious, since they are provided with care
fully laid, levelled, lime-surfaced, painted, and burnished clay
floors. In one place there are no fewer than seven superimposed
floors of this type. Walls were of beaten earth (pise) or of
"
plano-convex
" adobe. A building of stratum XI (the third
of the four early neolithic layers) contained a portico originally
supported by six wooden posts, a wide antechamber, and a large inner chamber. In and around this building there were no clearly domestic objects, but there were numerous animal
figurines, representing cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs, as well as
plastic models of the male organs, small cones, etc. We thus
find in this pre-ceramic culture, belonging to a very primitive agricultural and cattle-breeding folk, unmistakable indications
of a rather developed religious cult. The implications of this situation will be discussed below. The last great manifestation of the Stone Age in the Old
World was the megalithic phase. Strictly speaking, there never
was a "
megalithic culture," since megaliths seem nearly always to have been burial monuments: dolmens, menhirs, and crom
lechs, all built of huge, usually flat stones. Chronologically,
most megalithic remains can now be shown to belong to the Neolithic Age, though they seem to have survived into the
Chalcolithic in the Near East and they certainly lasted down into the late third millennium B. C. in northwestern Europe.
The circle at Stonehenge (second millennium) was a temple.
Megalithic burials appear in Palestine in their most archaic and
simplest form, which may now be dated roughly to the fifth
and sixth millennia B. C. The development of the art of build
ing megalithic tombs lagged greatly in Western Europe, where



96 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
it extended down to the close of the Neolithic. Burial chambers
were still constructed according to the megalithic principle o arrangement, though of far smaller stones, in the early Chalcolithic of the Jordan Valley and there are vestiges of this tradi
tion even in the Early Bronze of the southern Dead Sea district.
True megalithic monuments are found in the Near East exclu
sively in the hill-country of Palestine, especially in Transjordan,
and in the uplands of Syria, Asia Minor, Armenia, and Kur
distan. There can be no doubt that they belonged to pastoral
peoples, who herded cattle, sheep, and goats, and who may have been members of many different races, since there is not a scrap
of tangible evidence for the often inferred "
megalithic race/' Owing to the total absence of sculpture or carved ornament in
megalithic tombs, as well as to the paucity of offerings found
in those excavated, we have no basis for defining the religion of
their builders, except to say that great emphasis was obviously laid on after-life. It has plausibly been suggested that the mastabas and pyramids of Egypt are ultimately derived from
megalithic monuments, though we unfortunately lack all inter
mediate stages. On the other hand, the notion of the late Elliot
Smith that the pyramids were the prototypes of megalithic monuments, has been thoroughly disproved by archaeologists.
2. The Chalcolithic Age and the Irrigation Culture
We shall now describe the earliest sedentary cultures of the Near East as a whole, from their beginning in the potterybearing levels of Late Neolithic to the displacement of stone by copper as the dominant material of tools and weapons, about
3000 B. C, or even a little earlier. A number of names have
been proposed for this stage of human civilization; we have
preferred
" chalcolithic " because it is probably the one most
commonly used, but " ceramolithic " is in many ways a more suitable term, since it refers to the coexistence of pottery with
stone artifacts. 8 The boundary between true Neolithic and Chalcolithic is disputed, but there seems to be no reason why
we should not follow Garstang's rehabilitation of the neolithic
stage in the Near East, as a result of his work in 1935-6 at Jericho and in 1938-9 at Mersin in Cilicia. In the latter place
he has discovered twenty feet of accumulated neolithic debris,



PRAEPARATIO 97
with monochrome pottery and obsidian tools and weapons, but
without metal. The stage of culture in neolithic Mersin cor
responds roughly to that o late neolithic Jericho and also to that of the oldest layers of occupation in half a dozen recently excavated sites in northern Mesopotamia and Syria, all below
the oldest "
painted-pottery
" strata. All settlements of this age
which have been studied so far, are situated in large alluvial
valleys or in low plains and small valleys in which sufficient
running water is available for a developed system of irrigation.
The following stage, that of painted pottery, is extremely widespread, since it is found almost all over Western Asia and extends across Iran to Turkestan and the Indus Valley. Moreover, similar types of prehistoric pottery have been discovered in
Mongolia and northern China. In Egypt and Nubia we find a
parallel, but apparently distinct stream of ceramic tradition developing from the Neolithic of the Faiyum and Merimdeh.
Palestine and Southern Syria vary, sometimes following the
northern cultural tradition, sometimes the southern one. The main stream of culture then flowed through Syria and Mesopo
tamia, since it is in those lands that we find the greatest number
of settlements, the thickest deposits, and the highest cultural
level, which is not reached in any surrounding region at that
time except possibly in the still little known East, Iran and the
Indus Valley. In Mesopotamia and Syria the discoveries of the past ten
years (see above, p. 28) have brought to light a succession of
highly developed chalcolithic cultures, each represented by
occupational deposits of great thickness. The oldest seems to
be the Halafian, which was well distributed through northern
Mesopotamia and Syria, with a surrounding zone which it in
fluenced strongly. To judge from the many strata by which it is represented at some sites, it must have lasted for centuries
(fifth millennium B. G). The art of building was well de
veloped, including both houses with prevailing rectangular plan
and more massive buildings with circular ground-plan (tkoloi) , superficially resembling the Pueblo kivas. That these circular
buildings were shrines has been well demonstrated by Mal
lowan, who excavated the first examples at Arpachiyah near Nineveh. The earlier tboloi consist only of a simple circular



98 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
building on stone foundations and pise superstructure; the later ones are larger and have a rectangular antechamber before the circular chamber. At Arpachiyah there was a marked concentra
tion of figurines around the tholoi, a fact which suggests their cultic significance. Examination of the objects themselves
makes this inference certain, at least for the human figurines.
The latter are almost all plastic representations of nude, painted females, with the head hardly indicated, but with exaggerated
portrayal of the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, and vulvar region,
in keeping with the earlier Aurignacian practice. Most of these
figurines, like numerous ones of the same general type found in
other painted-pottery sites, are shown in a squatting position, with unmistakable indications of approaching delivery. In this connection it should be observed that squatting is the normal
position for women in labor in the modern East, just as it was
in the ancient Orient, as we know both from texts and from
figurines and drawings. Animal figurines are also abundant;
they nearly always represent cattle, sheep, pigs, and doves.
Since the dove was so closely associated with the mother goddess in the later Near East, both in texts and in art, it is only reasonable to explain the dove here in the same way. It was in the Halafian age, well before 4000 B. C, that the highest stage in the early history of the decorative art was
reached by vase-painters, probably in close imitation of skill
already attained by basket-makers and rug-weavers. The intri
cate polychrome geometric and floral designs with which the Halafians decorated the inside of shallow bowls and platters have not been surpassed in beauty, at least from our modern
viewpoint, at any subsequent time in history. That such decora
tive skill was not restricted to Mesopotamia is proved by its
closely parallel development in the roughly contemporary
Ghassulian of Palestine, where it serves to adorn fresco paint
ings. A site of about the same age near Persepolis in southwestern Iran, excavated recently by Herzfeld, shows almost
equal beauty in vase-painting and the art of painting frescoes seems not to have lagged behind. In the same general horizon
falls the marvellously delicate vase-painting of Susa I.
The Halafian was followed by the Samarran and especially
the Obeidian, to which corresponds a stage known in Syria as



PRAEPARATIO 99
Ugarit III, well illustrated by Ingholt's recent excavations at
Hamath on the Orontes. The Obeidian is the earliest clearly
defined culture o Babylonia, where we find its remains under
lying nearly all the oldest cities of the country, such as Ur,
Erech, Lagash, Eridu, etc. This proves that the occupation of
the marsh-lands of Babylonia by human settlers came rather
late in the history of the irrigation culture, probably not far
from 4000 B. C Babylonia rapidly distanced the older districts
of the north, since men were by this time able to apply their
acquired practice in draining marshes, digging canals, and
building dams to great advantage in the rich alluvial plains of
lower Mesopotamia. The civilization of Mesopotamia already began to assume, in the Obeidian age before 3500 B. C., the
basic forms which it was to exhibit for more than three millennia thereafter. In a late Obeidian stratum (XIII) at Tepe
Gawra in Assyria, Speiser has discovered (1936-7) well-built
rectangular temples with symmetrical plans and with elaborately recessed niches inside and outside, forming part of a construc
tional scheme which served both to buttress and to decorate the building.9 This new type of construction foreshadows a
series of similar temples at Tepe Gawra in the late chalcolithic levels X-VIII, as well as the elaborate group of late chalcolithic temples excavated by the Germans at Erech in southern Baby
lonia. Recessed niches continued to be characteristic elements
of temple planning down to the latest times in Mesopotamia.
After the Obeidian came the Warkan period in Babylonia,
with parallel, though not identical, cultural phases in northern
Mesopotamia and Syria. Now we witness an extraordinary burst of progress in the arts of civilization. This period is best
represented by the archaic temples of Erech, under the later
temples of Ami and Ishtar, the chief deities of the city. Here
the German excavators have, in the past ten years, brought to
light an artificial platform (for protection from the inundation)
on which was built a cluster of elaborately planned and con
structed temples. The objects from this age show that writing
had been invented and had already passed the purely pictographic stage, though many signs still have the form of the
object which they were meant to represent. Inventories and
business documents were inscribed with a stylus on clay tablets.



100 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Ownership and business responsibility were fixed by impressing seal cylinders, with exquisitely carved designs, on moist clay
sealings and dockets. The designs on these seals show that even in the third quarter of the fourth millennium B. C. art had already
passed far beyond any stage previously attained. Native skill,
empirically developed by generations of artists and craftsmen,
had reached the point where it became standardized, where
canons of proportion were established, and where the prevailing
motifs were processions of human and animal figures, temple facades, and fabulous monsters with interlaced necks and tails, etc. Standardization was thus accompanied by abstraction and
symbolism. The archaic cuneiform inscriptions so far published
are not entirely intelligible, but enough can be made out to indicate a complex economic life and an active cultic organi
zation. The language of the country was Sumerian, as it probably had been for the whole of the Chalcolithic Age (though
this is disputed and definitive evidence is lacking) . In the latest chalcolithic culture of southern Mesopotamia,
named after the site of Jemdet Nasr in northern Babylonia
where it was first identified, we have substantially only a continuation of the Warkan phase, with a considerable decrease
of elan, as well as a corresponding artistic impoverishment, though coupled with technical development. This period is characterized by growing complexity in the arts of civilization,
such as the increasing use of sculpture and of writing. The north was, of course, not so rich as Babylonia, but did not begin
to lag appreciably in culture until later, as shown by the small,
but symmetrically planned and well built temples of strata X
to VIII at Tepe Gawra. To this age or a little later belongs the
fantastic sculpture on the summit of Jebelet el-Beida in the extreme north of Mesopotamia, discovered in an ancient open
air shrine by Baron von Oppenheim.10
It is now possible roughly to synchronize the successive phases
of the Egyptian Chalcolithic with Syria and Mesopotamia. Egypt
remained much more restricted in its development and exhibits nothing comparable to the finest achievements of Halafian or
Warkan Mesopotamia. The flowering of Egyptian culture was to come later. Owing to the irresistible movement of the
Nile alluvium, which year by year rose in level and encroached



PRAEPARATIO 101
farther on the arid zone which bounded it on both sides, the earliest villages and cemeteries are now buried deep under the
mud. There is thus a gap between the neolithic cultures of the
Faiyum and the earliest discernible cultures of the Nile Valley proper. Since 1924 Brunton's discoveries have carried the latter back by bringing to light the Tasian and the closely related
Badarian which followed it. After the Badarian there is another
lacuna, and then we come to the predynastic cultures of the
fourth millennium which were distinguished by Petrie forty
years ago and named by him much more recently: the Amratian,
which was strongest in Upper Egypt, the Gerzean, which de
veloped in Lower Egypt, and the Semainean, which ushers us into the Dynastic Age. Since only villages and cemeteries have hitherto been discovered, our knowledge of art and architecture
is probably lop-sided, and architecture may have reached a much
higher level than we can infer from our present material How
ever, it is now certain that the level of Egyptian culture
remained considerably below that of Mesopotamia until the
First Dynasty, when under strong indirect influence from the
Euphrates Valley it forged ahead of the latter in a breath-taking
spurt.
The chalcolithic cultures of Palestine have all been discovered since 1929 but it was not until 1937 that their sequence and
relationship were adequately cleared up, thanks to stratigraphic excavations at Megiddo, Beth-shan, Jericho, 'Affuleh, and else
where. 11 The developed Early Chalcolithic of Palestine is
known as the GhassuUan, from the site near Jericho where it was first discovered; it has since been found or identified in numerous other sites in different parts of Palestine. This culture, which must be roughly contemporary with the Halafian of
Mesopotamia and is probably rather older than the Amratian
of Egypt, was characteristically chalcolithic in type, with a
highly developed flint industry, including polished axes, very
well made pottery, and rectangular houses of "
plano-convex
"
adobe on stone foundations. E. L. Sukenik has discovered models of Ghassulian houses which were used as ossuaries to hold the bones of the deceased.12 The houses of this period were decorated inside and outside with fresco designs painted on a lime surface; a portion of fresco recovered by A. Mallon



102 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
shows an astonishingly elaborate geometric pattern based on an eight-pointed star, around which were fragmentary remains of
an intricate field of dragons and geometric figures. The whole must have been a veritable phantasmagoria, showing that the
artistic imagination was abnormally active in Palestine nearly
6000 years ago. Another fresco, fortunately quite well preserved, represents a bird, painted with a naturalistic precision and an attention to detail which cannot be equalled in any
subsequent period of Palestine, until the Greek period. The most interesting and most enigmatic of all these mural frescoes
is unfortunately very badly preserved and a number of dubious
interpretations have been offered.13 All we can see with cer
tainty is a series of human legs and feet, all facing left except a smaller figure in front, belonging to the lower part of a nude
man facing right. Directly in front of him are two pairs of
somewhat geometrically drawn human feet (the first pair in embroidered shoes), each pair on a four-legged footstool.
Behind each stool are traces of chairs. The position of the
seated figures in this fresco is naturally conceptual and the figures must be thought of as seated side by side. From
Canaanite mythological texts and figured representations of the
second millennium B. C. we know that the gods were portrayed 2000 years later as sitting on thrones with their feet on stools,
so we are warranted in interpreting this scene in a similar way.
As a matter of fact, interpreters agree in regarding it as clearly cultic, but some are inclined to go considerably farther than
the fragment warrants. Suffice it to say that we have here evidence that the Ghassulians worshipped a goddess (in em
broidered shoes) and a god, the former taking precedence. We
also know that the dead were believed to pursue an existence
somewhat parallel to that on earth, since they were carefully buried in stone-lined graves, with ornaments and pottery (ori
ginally containing food).14 The Ghassulians of Khedheirah went farther, placing the bones of their deceased in houseurns, shaped like the houses of the living. This custom is also found in neolithic Europe, and reflects advanced conceptions of
the after-life.
The Ghassulian was followed by a period of many centuries,
during which we can discern a related, but definitely later cul



PRAEPARATIO 103
ture at Jericho (Jericho VIII), a still later stage at Beth-shan
(Beth-shan XVIII) and the Esdraelon culture, which is best
known from Megiddo and Beth-shan. The latter culture must be dated in the second half of the fourth millennium; it was
roughly contemporary with the Warkan and the Jemdet Nasr phases of the Babylonian Chalcolithic. Mesopotamian influences
are clear, especially in pottery and above all in the carved cylinder seals which were rolled over unbaked pottery in order
to decorate it with floral and animal scenes in relief. The early
cemetery of Byblus, recently excavated by M. Dunand, is char
acteristically Middle Chalcolithic; it shows that the coast of southern Phoenicia then belonged to the cultural domain of Palestine, not to that of northern Syria.
At the beginning of this section we stressed the fact that the settlements of chalcolithic age are practically all located in river
valleys and alluvial plains, where irrigation was possible.
Chalcolithic culture may thus be justly called "
irrigation culture," since its remarkable development would have been impos
sible without the powerful impetus given by the art of irriga
tion. 15 The monuments of the latest predynastic and the earliest
dynastic Egypt agree entirely with those of Sumerian civilization
in emphasizing the vast importance attached to the digging of
canals and the building of dams. Thanks to irrigation it was
possible to develop the arts of agriculture from their beginnings in the Mesolithic and their budding in the Neolithic of the Near
East to their brilliant flowering in the Chalcolithic. By the fourth millennium B. C. wheat, barley, dhurah (a kind of millet) , and other cereals were cultivated both in Egypt and in
Mesopotamia; such fruit as dates, olives, figs, grapes, etc., were
cultivated in different regions of the Near East; the Babylonians grew sesame for oil and the Egyptians grew flax both for oil
and for cloth; many garden vegetables were known and used.
It is probable that the domestication and development of garden
vegetables belong to the most important accomplishments of the irrigation culture, since most of them cannot be cultivated
in the Near East without an adequate supply of water. We
know that the cultivation of onions and garlic, of lettuce and
vegetable marrows, of melons, horse-beans and chick-peas, and
of many other kinds of vegetables and condiments, goes back



104 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
at least to the third and in part certainly to the fourth millen
nium in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The tremendous increase in
the amount and the variety of available food is reflected in the
striking rise of median human stature between the Mesolithic
and the late Chalcolithic, especially in regions where the irriga
tion culture was really able to operate properly. In order to dig canals and build dams, and especially in order to maintain the vital irrigating system after it had been finished,
a coordinated state organization was imperatively necessary. Without supervision and compulsory labor the canals silted up,
the dams broke, and the increasingly necessary dykes burst.
Every unusually high seasonal inundation and every unexpected flood caused by violent rains in the upper watersheds meant
wide-spread devastation, which had to be repaired immediately
lest famine and pestilence ensue. The perennial struggle with
the river-floods was much more acute in Babylonia than in
Egypt, where the rhythm of inundation is astonishingly regular. These three factors, the digging and dredging of canals, the
building and repair of barrages and dykes, and the uninterrupted adjustment of disputes between town and town, between
person and person about water-rights, made a stable and authoritative state a prerequisite to the maintenance of life
itself. Small wonder that the oldest organized states which we
find are in Mesopotamia and Egypt! First groups of villages
had to cooperate; then, as longer canals and higher dams were
undertaken, groups of district units. The same influence exerted
itself in religion. Since it devolved upon the latter to uphold the moral standards o the state, the priests were forced to apply religious sanctions in cases of carelessness or lack of
cooperation. The priests may sometimes, as in later periods, have taken over the upkeep of the irrigation system from a
state which had demonstrated its weakness. Whatever may have happened in detail, the discoveries at Erech in Babylonia have
proved that the temple-complex of Eanna was already before 3200 B. C. the centre of an elaborate economic organization, whose records and accounts were kept on clay tablets, individual items frequently rising above 3600 in number (3600 was a
round number in the sexagesimal system of the Sumerians). This is the age to which the Sumerian sagas of Gilgamesh and



PRAEPARATIO 105
other heroes clearly refer, since he is credited with the construc
tion of the wall of Erech, which according to archaeological
investigations was actually first built in the Warkan period.
To this general age must also be attributed the first union of Upper and Lower Egypt under one king, as recorded both on
the Palermo Stone and in the Manethonian dynastic lists.
3. The Early and Middle Bronze Ages: Mesopotamia
The history of Mesopotamia between 3000 and 1600 B. C.
may be divided into three main periods: 1. the classical Su
merian age from the end of the Jemdet Nasr period to the
triumph of Sargon of Accad about 2400 B. C.; 2. the SumeroAccadian age from Sargon to the fall of the Third Dynasty of
Ur, cir. 2400-2025 B. C.; 3. the period when Mesopotamia was
dominated by Western Semites, from the rise of Isin and Larsa to the fall of the First Dynasty of Babylon (cir. 1600 B. C.).
Our chronology follows the official Assyrian dates back to the
15th century B. C. and adjusts Babylonian chronology to them
with the aid of the new Mari synchronisms between Assyria,
Mari, and Babylonia, as pointed out by Sidney Smith and the
writer.16 There is perhaps a maximum error of fifty years back
to about 2400 B. C. ; the margin of error is less as we go down.
Before 2500 B. C. we can only reckon in centuries, with a
maximum error of one to two hundred years at the beginning of the third millennium. Since 1928 the relative chronology of the classical Sumerian
(often called "
early dynastic ") age has been firmly established
by the stratigraphic work of Woolley at Ur, of Jordan, Noldeke
and Heinrich at Erech, and especially of Frankfort at Eshnunna
and Khafajeh. This period may now be subdivided into three
phases, each represented by adequate monumental data. To the
first phase belong several hundred clay tablets from Ur, which
have been published (1935) by the late E. Burrows. These are
the oldest cuneiform documents which can really be read almost
throughout at the present stage of investigation, and they may
safely be dated about 2800 B. C. The third phase of the clas
sical Sumerian age is very well known, thanks particularly to
the famous Royal Tombs of Ur which belong to the early



106 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
part of it, and to the monuments of Lagash, which illuminate
its latter part. To the late second or the early third phase
belong also the Shuruppak tablets, about 1000 of which have
been discovered by a German expedition at the site of the
traditional home of the Babylonian Noah, now called Tell Farah. These documents have been studied and partly pub
lished (1922-4) by A. Deimel; they yield extremely valuable
information about cultural conditions and religious concepts
at about the 27th century B. C. The Royal Tombs of Ur, which
are a little later in date, are too well known to require description; their rich and varied contents illustrate both the great
wealth of a city like Ur about 2600 B. C. and the primitive barbarity of its customs. Several thousand tablets from the
Lagash period, mostly from the end of it in the 25th century
B. C., have been discovered and a large part of them have been
studied, mainly by A. Deimel and his students. The Lagash documents throw a flood of light on conditions in southern
Babylonia at this time, and since nearly all of them are con
nected with the temple administration, they are of direct interest
to the historian of religion. Of particular importance to us is also the group of inscriptions in which the last prince of this line, Urukagina (cir. 2450 B. C.), describes his administrative reforms, many of which relate to the exactions of the priests,
who had become increasingly powerful and had finally displaced the civil heads of the state, a generation or two
previously.
We now know that there were Semites (Accadians, to use the
term applied to them later in Babylonia) in Mesopotamia long
before Sargon of Accad. Kings with Semitic names appear in the Sumerian lists as reigning at Kish in northern Babylonia in three of the four pre-Sargonic dynasties of Kish, and Semitic
names occur sporadically in the Shuruppak (Farah) tablets. Sumerian documents of the Lagash period already have Semitic loanwords. Moreover, at Mari on the Middle Euphrates
we find a Semitic dynasty reigning about 2600 B. C., a century or two before Sargon of Accad. Since there do not appear to
be any signs of profound Semitic influence on Sumerian lan
guage or culture, while the reverse is certain, and since many
of the oldest names of towns and rivers in different parts of



PRAEPARATIO 107
Mesopotamia are demonstrably Sumerian, whereas not one
appears to be Semitic, we may be sure that the Semites did not precede the Sumerians there. It is probable that the Sumerians
created the irrigation culture of chalcolithic Mesopotamia while
the Semites were still in a semi-nomadic state. We shall point
out below that the true nomadism of Arab camel-herds was impossible before the domestication of the camel in the late second millennium B. C. ; earlier nomads were ass-herds, with vastly restricted scope of movement. However, the Semites must have begun to infiltrate into sedentary zones long before the end
of the fourth millennium, and northern Babylonia was already
dominantly Semitic before the time of Sargon, as we know from
the fact that his predecessor, the Sumerian king Lugalzaggisi,
had some of his inscriptions written in Accadian after his
conquest of Kish. 17
The Semitic Dynasty of Accad (dr. 2425-2245 B. C.) created an empire in the true sense for the first recorded time in history,
though Sumerian tradition credits much earlier rulers with ex
tensive conquests. Sargon and his successors, especially Rimush, Manishtusu, and Naram-Sin, ruled over a state which included
the whole of Mesopotamia and intermittently extended its sway
over Syria and Susiana (Elam) , besides sending expeditions to
southeastern Arabia and Asia Minor, if not farther. Until very
recently, our knowledge of this dynasty was mainly derived
from late sagas and from copies of its Semitic royal inscriptions
made in later times for the use of the temple-schools, but we
are now in a much more favorable position, thanks to dis
coveries at Nineveh, at Nuzi, and at Tell Ibraq, all in northern
Mesopotamia. The kings of Accad actually ruled northern Mesopotamia; business documents of the period, written in
Accadian, are known from Chagar Bazar, Tell Ibraq, and Nuzi; Manishtusu built a temple of Ishtar at Nineveh and Naram-Sin
built a great palace for himself at Tell Ibraq. In view of this
new material we are no longer justified in denying the essential
historicity of the epic called "The King of Battle" (shar
tamkhari}, according to which Sargon was persuaded by Ac
cadian merchants trading in Asia Minor to invade that distant
country.18 As might be expected, there was also a remarkable
artistic revival, which transformed and modernized the heavy



108 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Sumerian art of the Lagash period, long since standardized
and unable to make further progress. Sargonic art, as shown by the triumphal stela of Naram-Sin from Susa and the bronze
helmet from Nineveh,19 as well as by superb examples of seal
engraving, was not appreciably behind contemporary art in Egypt. However, while the Pyramid Age endured for nearly
400 years, the flowering of Sargonic culture hardly lasted more than a century. Long after the end of the Dynasty of Accad, its glories were remembered in saga both by the Accadians them
selves and by the Hurrians and Hittites of the north.20
The empire of Accad crashed under the blows of Gutian
barbarians from the Zagros Mountains (cir. 2250 B. C.) and
Babylonia sank into a brief dark age, from which few records
have survived. We know that Sumerian culture revived in the south, thanks to temporary freedom from Accadian overlordship, and a Sumerian renaissance began. Culturally this Su
merian revival was under the sign of Accad and its art was unmistakably influenced by the art of Accad. It has left us our
most important document of Sumerian religion, the long inscriptions of Gudea, viceroy of Lagash under the later Gutian kings (late 22nd century B. C.). This renascent Sumerian tradition
was able to impose itself on the new Sumero-Accadian empire
which was founded by Zur-Nammu of Ur and lasted over a
century (the Third Dynasty of Ur, cir. 2135-2025 B. C.). The
"
kings of Sumer and Accad," as they called themselves in their
official titulary, ruled over nearly as large a territory as the kings
of Accad, but we seldom hear of wars virtually never in the
royal inscriptions. From this time on the old practice of both Sumerian and Accadian princes is altered and peace reigns
undisturbed in later inscriptions of Babylonian kings, whatever the actual situation may have been. Only in the north of Meso
potamia was the Accadian tradition of celebrating martial
exploits continued; in the south it remained "bad form " for
nearly two millennia. The Sumerian renaissance which is documented by the inscriptions of Gudea continued through the
Third Dynasty of Ur, but it is increasingly clear that the two
linguistic groups lived together in harmony, while Semitic Accadian slowly, but irresistibly, gained ground as the language
of the people. By the 18th century B. C. Hammurabi could



PRAEPARATIO 109
speak of it as the language of the country and Sumerian seems
no longer to have been actually used for personal names after
his reign, though several kings of the following Dynasty of
the Sea Lands took Sumerian throne-names in the 16th century
B. C. The five hundred years from 2100 to 1600 were exceedingly active intellectually, and the material which has come into our hands from them, largely through the excavations of the
University of Pennsylvania in the precincts of the temple of Ellil at Nippur, is of extraordinary importance.
The empire of Sumer and Accad collapsed in its turn,
weakened by the obstinate encroachments of the nomadic
Western Semites, who were called " Amorites "
(that is,
"Westerners") by the Babylonians.21 The death-blow was
dealt by two former provinces of the empire, Elam and Mari.
According to Sumerian letters from the closing years of the dynasty, Amorite mercenaries played a considerable role in
these wars, probably on all sides. The heritage of the Third
Dynasty of Ur was taken over by numerous smaller states, the
most important of which were Isin, founded by the Accadian
governor of Mari, and Larsa, headed by an Amorite. Between 2100 and 1800 B. C. nearly all these states passed under
Amorite rule: Mari itself became Amorite in the course of the 20th century; Eshnunna passed under Amorite domination a little later; Babylon became the centre of an Amorite state
about 1900; Assur, the capital of Assyria, was occupied by an Amorite chieftain about 1800. In Babylonia and Assyria proper, however, the native Accadians continued to form the majority
of the population and neither the Babylonian nor the Assyrian
dialect of later times shows any appreciable Amorite influence. The Amorites were able to replace the Accadians only in northwestern Mesopotamia, from the frontiers of Babylonia up the
Euphrates to south of Cardiemish, and eastward to the Khabur
basin, as we know from the new Mari documents, discovered in 1935-8. North of Mons Masius and east of the Tigris the
population was dominantly Human.
The Hurrians (biblical Horites) have only been known to scholars for the past twenty years and most of our information
about them is less than ten years old.22 Since they played a role in ancient Near-Eastern cultural history fully as great as that



110 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
of the Hittites and almost equal to that of the Canaanites, a brief sketch of their history in the light of our present knowl
edge is in order. Physically they were prevailingly Armenoids of the brachycephalic type still dominant among the Armenians ;
linguistically they were certainly related to the Urartians of Iron-Age Armenia and perhaps connected with the Caucasic
peoples of later times, such as the Georgians and Mingrelians.
Their home-land was thus almost certainly the region south of
the Caucasus, and they first appear in history about 2400 B. C. in the Zagros region. After the Gutian triumph over the last
kings of Accad the Hurrians seem to have swarmed down from the Kurdish mountains into northern Mesopotamia, especially
the East-Tigris country. Hurrian names were common even in
southern Mesopotamia during the Third Dynasty of Ur and
they continue to be fairly numerous under the First Dynasty of
Babylon. Most interesting is the recent discovery of a number of fragmentary Hurrian tablets at Mari, where they must ante
date the 18th century B. C. One of them contains an incantation
against toothache (as known from the Accadian label) . To this early phase of Hurrian literature (cir. 2400-1800 B. C.) belong some of the Hurrian religious texts found at the ancient Hittite capital of Khattusas (Boghazkoy) in Asia Minor, as well as the
lost Hurrian originals of several mythological texts which had
been translated into Hittite. This we know from the fact that the gods are prevailingly Old Hurrian and from the status of
Urkish, which appears in them as the chief Hurrian religious
centre, whereas we know from the inscription of Arishen that it was the capital of an important Hurrian state soon after the fall of Accad, about the 22nd century B. C. It is not yet clear whether the intensive Hurrian settlement of the East-Tigris
country which we find in the 15th century B. C. goes back to this
age or not, but it is already practically certain that the Hurrian
occupation of Syria and parts of Palestine in the 15th century
is the result of the Hyksos movement and does not in general
antedate the 17th century. The Hurrians adopted the principal
gods, heroes, and myths of the Sumero-Accadians, which they combined with their own, producing a most extraordinary
syncretism. It was mainly through Hurrian mediation that Sumero-Accadian culture reached the Hittites and other Anato
lian peoples.



PRAEPARATIO 111
A bright light is shed on the ethnic composition and culture
of Northern Mesopotamia and Asia Minor about 1900 B. C. by the Cappadocian tablets, which consist of several thousand business documents and letters, written in Old Assyrian and forming part of the commercial archives of the Assyrian mer
chant colony at Kanish, modern Kiil-tepe in eastern Asia Minor.
These documents have been intensively studied by J. Lewy,
thanks to whose work we can follow the commercial and legal transactions of the Accadian colonists in Cappadocia and their
relations with the native " Hittite "
population in great detail
The texts show that this colony was, like scores of others, established in eastern Asia Minor in the 20th century B. C. by
a dynasty of Accadian princes of Assur which rose to power
after the fall of the empire of Ur, cir. 2000 B. C., and lasted until displaced by an Amorite chieftain (see above), about
1800 B. C. This brief Assyrian commercial expansion was rendered possible by the fact that the Amorite nomads had cut the old commercial route from Babylonia up the Euphrates by
way of Mari and Ibla and that the Assyrians had succeeded in
developing a new oae up the Tigris through Hurrian territory.
The 18th century B. C. is now one of the best known ages of antiquity, thanks to the thousands of Babylonian documents
from the time of Hammurabi (cir. 1792-1749) and his imme
diate successors which have hitherto been published and to the
discovery at Mari since 1935 of over 20,000 tablets, nearly all
belonging to the first half of the century. MM. Dossin, Jean,
Thureau-Dangin, and others have already described these docu
ments so fully and accurately that we can use them for historical purposes. Mari seems then to have been the most important
state in Western Asia, whose power extended up the Euphrates from the frontier of Babylonia proper to south of Carchemish,
a distance of over 300 miles in a straight line. The palace of its king Zimri-Lim was one of the show-places of the world, as
we are expressly told in one of the letters; it was found by
A. Parrot to cover more than fifteen acres. In the palace were mural paintings whose discovery has already revolutionized our idea of the development of Near-Eastern art in the early second
millennium B. C. Some 5000 of the tablets are letters to the
king from high officials and district officers of Mari, as well as



112 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
from scores of other Mesopotamian and Syrian princes. The
state of administrative efficiency was remarkably high, as we see from the detailed instructions given and asked, and from the
care paid to the irrigation system on which the prosperity of
the land depended. How closely details were watched and what
full records were kept appears, e. g., from two enormous tablets,
each of which contains nearly a thousand names of craftsmen
belonging to different guilds. Owing to the acute rivalry be
tween the Amorite princes of Mesopotamia and Syria, as well
as to the constant pressure of still unsettled nomadic groups
of Amorite, Aramaean, or Hebrew origin, great attention was
paid to defense and to public security. An elaborate system of
fire signals, by which news might be flashed for hundreds of
miles in a few hours, was maintained. The personal names of
the people of Mari were nearly all Amorite, with a small pro
portion of Accadian and Hurrian names, and the tablets, though written in Accadian, are full of Amorite words, expressions,
and grammatical peculiarities. Mari thus represents, as exactly as could possibly be expected, the result of the adoption of Accadian culture by a nomadic West-Semitic folk, speaking a tongue which must have been virtually identical with the
ancestral Hebrew of the Patriarchs, as we shall see. The culture of northwestern Mesopotamia, the region around Harran, which
often figures in these documents, was a mixture of Hurrian and Amorite elements, on a Sumero-Accadian foundation. The
Cappadocian tablets, the Mari documents, the Code and archives of Hammurabi, and the Nuzi tablets of the 15th century B. C.
are all important in defining and illustrating its various aspects.
With the victory of Hammurabi over Larsa, Eshnunna, and
Mari, the ascendancy of Babylon began. The empire founded
by Hammurabi covered about the same territory as had that of the Third Dynasty of Ur, and it lasted over a century and
a half (cir. 1760-1600 B.C.), though with reduced territory;
it was finally destroyed by a long-distance raid from Asia Minor, mentioned in both the Hittite and the Babylonian chronicles.
Owing to the fact that the reigning dynasty was itself of Amorite origin and was solicitous to maintain its suzerainty over
the west and northwest, as we know from several royal inscriptions, it was able to exert a disproportionate influence in the



PRAEPARATIO 113
west. Babylon, which had been an insignificant town in previous centuries, suddenly rose to be the administrative and com
mercial centre o a rich empire. Its buildings, now below the water-table of the Euphrates, must have been even more impres
sive than those of Mari, and its temple-tower, Etemenanki,
" the House of the Foundation Platform of Heaven and Earth/' was already one of the wonders of the world. In an Ugaritic
saga of the fifteenth century king Pabel (for Babel) appears
as a legendary figure of the past and in Hebrew tradition the
Tower of Babel appears as the centre from which men had dis
persed to the four quarters of the earth. How completely it was
destroyed by the Hittite king Mursilis, about 1600 B. C, appears
from the fact that it lay in ruins for generations and that the
earliest occupation levels found by the German excavators directly above the houses of the First Dynasty dated from about the 14th century B. C.
4. The Early and Middle Bronze Ages: Egypt
Egyptian history from about 3000 to the 18th century B. C. may be conveniently divided into four periods: 1. the Proto
dynastic (Thinite) Age, from the beginning of the First Dy
nasty to the end of the Second; 2. the Pyramid Age, covering the
four Memphite dynasties from the Third to the Sixth; 3. the
First Intermediate Age, from the late Sixth to the late Eleventh Dynasty; 4. the Middle Empire, from the late Eleventh to the Thirteenth Dynasty. Absolute chronology is fixed to within a decade back to about 2000 B. C., thanks to Borchardt's discoveries of datings of astronomical events according to the
vague calendar and of a detailed genealogy of Memphite priests
going back to the Eleventh Dynasty. The chronology of the third millennium is far from being settled in detail. However, careful examination of the Palermo Stone and its recently discovered Cairene fragment, as well as critical study of the famous
Turin Papyrus (belonging to the 13th century B. C.) in the
light of this stone and of contemporary datings and biographies
of officials, makes it certain that all systems based on the Manethonian lists are much too high. Even the Turin Papyrus offers totals and regnal years which are often demonstrably excessive. Since Scharff's criticism of the Meyer-Breasted



114 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
chronology in 1926 scholars have increasingly dated the accession of Menes, founder of the First Dynasty, about 3000 B. C.
The latest possible date for Menes is about 2800 B. C. ; we may
safely adopt a tentative date about a century earlier.23
The close of the Predynastic Age and the beginning of the Thinite period witnessed a sudden burst of progress in the arts
of civilization. This seems to have been connected in some way with an increase of cultural influence from Asia, since there
are numerous exact parallels between Mesopotamian and Egyptian culture at this time, the former being demonstrably older
and more original in nearly every instance. 24 This influence did
not apparently affect language, script, or religious life; but it
did bring new artistic motives, new artifacts such as the cylinder
seal, and new industrial techniques. Since there is no evidence of an invasion of Egypt at that time by Asiatics, as has been
rashly assumed, it is probable that this influence was brought
into the land by the Egyptians themselves, who may already have established some kind of ascendancy over Palestine and the coastland of Syria, just as they did in the First Dynasty.
The wealth of the state under the first Thinite kings is vividly
illustrated by successive tomb discoveries, especially those made by Emery at Saqqarah since 1936. While the order of kings is
not absolutely certain, the work of Sethe and Reisner has practically demonstrated that the Horus kings Aha, Nar-mer, and Djer must be identified with Menes, Athothis I, and Athothis
II of the later lists, respectively.
25 The first two completed the
union of Upper and Lower Egypt by force of arms; the third king already invaded Asia, as recorded in the Cairo fragment
of the Palermo Stone. In subsequent reigns we find increasing evidence of close relation with Asia; Usaphais claims to have
smitten the Easterners; Semempses has left a triumphal repre
sentation carved on the rock above the copper-workings of Sinai; from the tombs of the latter kings of the dynasty come
Syrian pottery and an ivory carving of an Asiatic Semite. In the Second Dynasty relations became still closer; its last ruler,
Nebka (Horus Khasekhemwey) ,* sent votive offerings to
Byblus, and he was presumably not the first pharaoh to do so.
Byblus and Ai have yielded numerous Egyptian objects of the
proto-dynastic period, showing that there was relatively con



PRAEPARATIO 115
siderable trade between Egypt and Syria-Palestine at that time. Since no temples of the age have been discovered and inscrip
tions are without exception very brief and stereotyped, we have
little information about Egyptian religion. What we have
comes mostly from the Palermo Stone, confirmed and illustrated
by contemporary sources.
With the Memphite Third Dynasty commences the Pyramid
Age (cir. 2600-2200 B. C). It opens in a blaze of glory, since
the founder, king Djoser, and his chief minister, Imhotep
(Imuthes), have immortalized themselves by the constructions which the latter built for his master at Saqqarah. The step
pyramid of Djoser is the oldest of the pyramids and the beauti
ful mortuary temple at its foot (discovered in 1924 and since
then excavated) is the oldest building of hewn stone known in the world. Imuthes became one of the heroes of Egyptian saga
and was ultimately deified, but his historicity, long doubted by
Egyptologists, has been effectually confirmed by an inscription
found in the temple which he built. A generation after Djoser' s death came Snefru, founder of the Fourth Dynasty (cir. 2550
2450 B. C.) . The triumphs of architecture and of art which we associate with his successors Cheops, Chephren, and Mycerinus
are known to all, especially since Reisner's excavations in the
mortuary temple of Mycerinus. Egypt was then an absolute monarchy, in which the deified king was served by an army of officials and functionaries of various kinds. The entire power and wealth of the state were organized for the purpose of
carrying out the tremendous building operations of each reign,
culminating in the great pyramid of the pharaoh, which had to
be finished in less than twenty years. What this meant may be
realized when we recall that the Great Pyramid of Cheops contains over two million blocks of limestone, each averaging
over two tons in weight and yet the geometrical accuracy of the construction and the precision with which the granite casing was finished still arouse the admiration of the ablest engineers. The most remarkable thing about the pyramids is, however, that
we should have almost no knowledge whatever of the early history of the Egyptians if it were not for their faith in a
glorious after-life for their kings!
Monumentally, the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties (cir. 2450-2200



116 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
B. C.) appear as pale reflections of the glories of the Fourth.
Historically they are very much better known, since temples,
tombs, and other remains are much more abundant and inscriptions are much more numerous and detailed. Egypt remained a wealthy and powerful country, and the abnormal concentration
on building which had characterized the preceding dynasty was
abandoned for healthier diversity of effort. The centralization of power in the hands of the king and his chief ministers was
also replaced by a great increase of district autonomy under local
nomarchs, whose semi-feudal office was generally transmitted
by heredity. The Egyptian empire in Asia was maintained:
Byblus, the emporium of the cedar trade, became virtually an
Egyptian colony, to judge from the quantity of votive offerings sent to its temple by kings of these dynasties; campaigns in Palestine or Syria are described by their military commanders,
one of whom gives us a list of captured towns with Canaanite
names. The Fifth Dynasty continued to show great interest in
the after-life of its pharaohs, who were descended from a
priestly family and built superb temples to the sun-god at
Abusir in Middle Egypt. The pyramid of Onnos, the last king
of the dynasty, inaugurates a custom which was happily continued in the Sixth Dynasty: the walls of the interior chambers
were covered with carefully carved and painted magical spells and hymns, all to be used by the spirit of the defunct king as he ascended to heaven to be united with the sun-god. These Pyramid Texts will hold our attention later, since- they date from between 2400 and 2200 B. C. and are thus not only among
the longest but also the oldest religious texts known; important
additions to their contents have been made by recent discoveries.
As we shall see they contain many texts which must go back to
the Predynastic Age, and it is very unlikely that the corpus as a whole had been changed appreciably by oral transmission after the Thinite period, several centuries earlier. This impression
of antiquity is confirmed by their archaic grammar and vocabu
lary, as well as by the predominantly phonetic writing, used to
prevent the hieroglyphs from being read with wrong words and
grammatical forms. Thanks to the admirable edition of them
begun in 1908 by K. Sethe and still in progress since his death,
they are now accessible to scholars generally.



PRAEPARATIO 117
In the course of the 23rd century B. C. (according to our
minimal chronology) the power of the pharaohs was so reduced
by the internal weakness of the state that several nomarchs
were able to make themselves entirely independent of the
throne. After the long reign (some 90 years) of Phiops II and
the ephemeral ones of his successors, the unity of the state was
entirely destroyed and for over a century rival Theban and
Heracleopolitan kings contended for the supremacy. The union
of the nation was not reestablished until the reign of the
Theban king Sebek-hotpe III, about the middle of the 21st century or a little later. During this dark age, known as the
First Intermediate, little is known about the history of the land,
and we are restricted mainly to the inscriptions of the local
nomarchs for such information as we possess. Civil war was intermittent; the maintenance of public order was hardly even attempted; Asiatic invasions devastated parts of Lower Egypt. According to the careful analysis of literary texts from this
period by J. Pirenne (1937),27 it appears that the leading cities
of the Delta made themselves independent of the state and set
up local councils, like some of the Phoenician cities in later
times. Under such conditions the irrigation works of Memphite
times must have suffered great damage and the agricultural
yield must have been greatly reduced. It is small wonder that
the literary texts of the age, preserved in papyrus, rolls of later centuries, exhibit profound pessimism, and begin to reflect in
generalized terms on the place and worth of man in the scheme of things (see the detailed discussion below) !
The Middle Empire is much better known than preceding
periods, though little information about external relations was available until Sethe's publication of the first execration texts in 1926 and the discovery of hundreds of additional ones in 1938.
From these documents, supplementing what was already known,
it is certain that the kings of Egypt controlled an extensive
African and Asiatic empire, extending from south of the Second
Cataract of the Nile to northern Phoenicia. The execration texts mention many towns of Western Palestine and at least one in
northern Transjordan. Gold and spices came from Nubia;
copper was mined in the Eastern Desert and Sinai; trade with
Asia was extensive. For nearly three hundred years, from the



118 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
reunion of Egypt in the 21st century to the breakdown of central
authority in the 18th, Egypt was united and enjoyed an unprece
dentedly high degree of prosperity. For over two centuries of the Twelfth Dynasty (cir. 2000-1800 B. C.) successive pharaohs
named Amenemmes or Sesostris, reigning an average of nearly
thirty years apiece and connected by regencies with predecessors
and successors, maintained peace and order in the land. Moreover, the kings did not exhaust the forces of their subjects in
building great structures for their own glory, and the most im
pressive public works of which we know were concerned with
the drainage and development of the Faiyum and the construction of a defensive wall across the Isthmus of Suez, in order to
keep Semitic raiders out of Egypt. We cannot be surprised,
therefore, to find that literature flourished as it never had before
and never did again, and that mathematics, medicine, and other disciplines then reached the climax of their development in
Egypt. The gradual breakdown of central power came in the
Thirteenth Dynasty, which was brought to an end after about
1750 by successive waves of Asiatic invaders, whom the Egyp
tians called "
Hyksos."
5. The Early and Middle Bronze Ages: Palestine, Syria,
Asia Minor
We have devoted what may have seemed disproportionate
space to tracing the history of early Mesopotamia and Egypt
in broad lines. Since Mesopotamia and Egypt were the foci of
ancient Near-Eastern civilization and since recent discoveries
have antiquated all existing handbooks, this has been necessary in order to provide the historical background for our main
theme. The lands between them and adjoining them on the north need not be surveyed in such detail, but since recent discoveries have even more completely antiquated what is said
about them in the latest handbooks, we shall devote ourselves
mainly to correcting widespread misapprehensions about their culture and ethnic status between 3000 and 1600 B. C. The cultural chronology of Palestine and southern Syria in
the Early and Middle Bronze Ages has been practically settled
by the archaeological work of the last ten years and has now
been systematized by G. E. Wright (1937) ,
28 The Early Bronze



PRAEPARATIO 119
may be divided into four phases which together lasted a
thousand years, from before 3000 to about 2100 B. C. The cultural climax of this millennium was in its second quarter, as illustrated by the extensive ruins of the city of Beth-yerah
(" House of the Moon ") at the southern end of the Sea of
Galilee and by contemporary strata at Beth-shan and Megiddo.
There is ample evidence now to show that the population of
Palestine and southern Phoenicia was already Canaanite, i. e.,
that the spoken tongue was the " mother " or " aunt " of the South Canaanite of the Late Bronze Age, a millennium later. Canaanite civilization in the Early Bronze undoubtedly reached
a high degree of development, illustrated by the fact that it
employed its own system of writing, a syllabic script obviously patterned externally on Egyptian, to judge from recent dis
coveries of M. Dunand at Byblus.29 The mythological poems
of Ugarit may well go back in part to Old Canaanite prototypes of the Early Bronze.
The extent of Egyptian influence is vividly illustrated by recent discoveries at Byblus in Phoenicia and at Ai in central Palestine. After the middle of the third millennium occupation
spread into southern Transjordan. About the 22nd century
B. C., or even a little earlier, we find a break in the continuity of occupation; fewer and fewer towns were inhabited and such
centres as Ai were destroyed and abandoned. This progressive
depopulation of the country reached its extreme point about
2000 B. C., after which date the curve of occupation rises even
more rapidly than it fell, except in southern Transjordan, where sedentary life ceased almost entirely for many centuries (cir.
19th-13th centuries B.C.).30 This situation shows such re
markable synchronization with what we now know about the course of the Amorite movement in Mesopotamia (see above,
p. 109) that it is difficult to separate it from the latter. That
the two movements actually belong together is shown by the fact that the numerous personal names from Palestine and southern Syria which are found in the execration texts already published and which will be multiplied several times by those
now in the course of publication, nearly all belong to precisely the same linguistic and onomastic type as the Amorite names
in contemporary cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia and Syria.



120 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
In the entire fertile crescent nomadic pressure seems to have
reached its height in the period between 2200 and 2000, when it
also penetrated into Egypt. From about 2000 B. C. on the
nomads seem to have become more interested in settling down
than in making fresh raids, so sedentary occupation began to expand, and with it the arts of civilization. In this connection it is important to define the nature of
" Amorite " nomadism at this time. As we have intimated above, the type of nomadic life then known in Western Asia
was essentially different from the nomadism of true Arab Bedu
during most of the past 3000 years. The latter is very well
known to us from the pre-Islamic Arab poets and especially
from the detailed accounts of men like Doughty and Musil,
describing the life of the Bedu in the half-century before the
First World War (since which conditions of life in Arabia have
been radically changed) . Arab nomadism is conditioned by the
domestication of the camel, which makes it possible for Bedu to
live entirely on their herds of camels, drinking their milk, eating camel curds and camel flesh, wandering through regions where only the camel can subsist and making rapid journeys of several
days, if need be, through waterless deserts. The Assyrian accounts of campaigns in Arabia in the seventh century B. C.
give an admirable idea of what the camel meant to the Arabs
of that time. We do not know exactly when the camel was
domesticated, though it is quite certain that wild camels were
common in North Africa and Arabia in very early times. The camel first appears in cuneiform inscriptions and monumental
representations about the eleventh century B. C. (inscription
of the Broken Obelisk and earliest orthostates of Tell Halaf, biblical Gozan) . From that time on it appears more and more frequently in cuneiform documents. It is interesting to note
that the great irruption of camel-riding Midianites into Palestine
also took place about 1100 B. C. or a little later. 81 Camels are
never mentioned in Egyptian inscriptions nor do they appear in pictorial representations of historical times; camel bones do not appear ever to have been identified in Bronze-Age deposits in Palestine. In short, the effective domestication of the camel
cannot antedate the outgoing Bronze Age, though partial and sporadic domestication may go back several centuries earlier.



PRAEPARATIO 121
It is very significant that no mention of the camel has yet been
reported from Middle-Bronze Mari, though it is situated on the
edge of the Syrian Desert. It is interesting to note that the Amorites of the 18th century B. C. sacrificed the ass where the
pagan Arabs of Byzantine times sacrified the camel.
So far as their mode of life was concerned, the nomadic Amorites of about 2000 B. C. could not have been far removed from the modern Sleib of the Syrian Desert, except that the
former were not travelling tinkers like the latter.32 Their
outward appearance may be reconstructed without difficulty
from the mural paintings of Beni Hasan, which portray a
nomadic chieftain named Absha with his clansmen and their families, 37 in all, about 1900 B. C. Asses are used for transportation. Both men and women are dressed in elaborately
woven, many-colored woolen tunics; the men wear sandals and
the women shoes. The men are armed with composite bows,
heavy throw-sticks, and javelins. One of them carries an eight
stringed lyre. This tableau shows that we must not picture the
Amorite nomads as too primitive, though they were doubtless
wild and savage enough from the standpoint of the Egyptians and Accadians. In 1924 E. Chiera published an exceedingly interesting Sumerian hymn to the god of the West, in which the following is said of the Amorites of the western hills:
" The weapon is (his) companion . . .
Who knows no submission,
Who eats uncooked flesh,
Who has no house in his life-time,
Who does not bury his dead companion." 3S
This is naturally a somewhat extreme description, but it vividly illustrates the attitude of the sedentary folk of Babylonia at an undetermined period in the third millennium. It may be
added that the Arab peasants of Syria still call the nomads
el-wukush, " the wild beasts/ ' If we compare the nomadic Amorites with the true Bedu of
a generation ago, we shall thus find fundamental differences,
because of the use of asses instead of camels for transport and
the total lack of horses for swift movement. The nomadic Amorites were dependent on pasturage for their herds of



122 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
cattle, sheep, goats, and asses and, apart from their herds, on hunting game and raiding crops for food. They could not,
therefore, live in any part of the true desert except in the late
winter and early spring. The rest of the year they were obliged to live either in oases, on the outskirts of zones of sedentary
occupation, or in the hill-country of Palestine, Syria, and Meso
potamia. They could not make dashes or long forced journeys without racing camels or horses, and had to travel and attack on foot, depending on ambush and darkness instead of on swift
and unexpected raids. In view of these facts, the difference in
culture (as distinct from mode of life) between settled Semites
and the nomadic Semites who lived cheek by jowl with them cannot have been appreciable, and the boundary between full
nomad and half-nomad must have been very much less apparent than among the Arabs today.
Turning to northern Syria and eastern Asia Minor, we pass
from Semitic territory to regions which have nearly always been
non-Semitic. The ethnic situation in Asia Minor about 1900
B, C. is fairly clear, owing to the evidence of the Cappadocian
tablets (see above, p. Ill) and especially of the later Hittite archives at Khattusas (Boghazkoy). Eastern Asia Minor was
still largely peopled by members of a linguistic stock known to themselves as the Khatti (Hittites), but termed by scholars
" Proto-Hittites " in order to distinguish them from the later
Hittites, whose official language was an Indo-European tongue
which they themselves called Nasi or Nesi. The Nasians seem also to have settled in Cappadocia before 2000 B. C., but we
do not yet know how long they had been in Asia Minor. Their
language was related to that of another early Indo-European
people known to the Hittites as Luwi. The Luwians occupied most of southern Asia Minor, entering probably not later than
the early third millennium, if we may judge from the evidence
of place-names; in the 18th century B. C. we find a Luwian
dynasty ruling as far east as Carchemish on the Euphrates. The
fact that a single linguistic group occupied the entire south of
the peninsula was obviously of great importance for the diffusion of cultural elements from east to west, as well as from west to east after the flowering of Middle Minoan civilization in Crete about the 20th century B. C.



PRAEPARATIO 123
In the same general age the native states of Asia Minor first
come into the scope of written history, thanks to the Cappa
docian tablets and to the Hittite archives, sources from which
we learn a good deal about their wars. It was not until the
17th century, however, that the Old Empire was established by
the Hittites; its founder, Labarnas, gave his name to his suc
cessors as a royal title. 34 The progress of Hittite arms was rapid.
Labarnas's son, Khattusilis, conquered most of eastern Asia
Minor; his grandson, Mursilis, invaded northern Syria, captur
ing Aleppo, which had been a century and a half earlier the seat
of an Amorite prince. Not content with this triumph, Mursilis
sent an expeditionary force hundreds of miles farther and de
stroyed Babylon, putting an end to the First Dynasty (cir. 1600
B. C) . Soon afterwards the Hittite power declined, the nobles
became occupied with palace intrigues and civil wars, and presently the Old Hittite Empire vanished from history.
B. THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE EARLY AND MIDDLE BRONZE AGES
Without succumbing to the temptation to enter into an elabo
rate discussion of comparative religion, we must first survey the situation in the field of primitive religion in order to see what light falls on the ancient Near East from this side. For perti
nent questions of general method we may refer to Chapters
I and II.
1. The Nature and Evolution of Primitive Religion
Thanks to the labors of many eminent ethnologists and his
torians of religion, we can see much more clearly in the difficult
field of primitive religion than was possible even a decade ago.
Certain conclusions emerge with high probability from their collections and their analyses, and certain general postulates
justify themselves so consistently that we may accept them as
binding. Recent progress has been mainly in two directions, in
systematizing and clarifying our ideas of ft
primitive
" and "
savage
"
mentality, and in demonstrating the antiquity and the
diffusion of belief in "
high
"
gods. The first we owe largely to
R. Levy-Bruhl, whose two great books, Les jonctions mentales



124 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
dans les societes injeneures (1910) and especially La mentalite
primitive (1922), have crystallized opinion and have been in
creasingly influential during the past decade. 34a Gathering a mass of ethnological data and analyzing it with the skill and
experience of a trained psychologist, he has reached very im
portant results, though many feel that he has somewhat exag
gerated the difference between the thinking processes of "
primi
tive " and " civilized " man rather by neglecting to analyze
the "
primitive
"
thought-processes of unsophisticated modern
man than by failing to understand those of the true savage.
Levy-Bruhl stresses the prelogical character of primitive thought, which fails to take account of contradictions, lacks any clear concept of causal relations, for which it substitutes simple ex
planation by sequence, or superficial concomitance, or accidental resemblance. Fundamental to primitive thinking are also im
personality and fluidity. The savage seldom or never thinks of the individual as having a distinct personality; all tends to be
merged in collective or corporate personality, or is dissolved in
factitious relationships between men, animals, plants, and cosmic or other inanimate objects and forces. There is a primitive power of abstraction which leads to a kind of elementary meta
physics, most characteristic of which is the long recognized idea
of impersonal power or force (called
"
pre-animism
" by Marett), which resides in unusual persons, objects, or phenomena, as well as in gods and spirits. This conception survives in early Near-Eastern religion and mythology, and remained dominant for millennia in magic. It is particularly the merit of
K. Beth to have repeatedly emphasized the importance of the
impersonal power, the mctna, orenda, and wakonda of ethnolo
gists, for the history of ancient Near-Eastern religion, as we
shall see below.35 A. Bertholet has recently coined the happy
term "dynamism " to replace Marett's "
pre-animism." 36
The second main development in recent study of the history
of primitive religion is the recognition of the worship of
"
high
"
gods as well as of spirits. These high gods may be
all-powerful and they may be credited with creation of the
world; they are generally cosmic deities who often, perhaps
usually, reside in heaven. These gods are found among savage
peoples in all parts of the earth, including Africa, Australia,



PRAEPARATIO 125
and South America. To have collected an immense body of data
demonstrating the belief in high gods and to have classified
pertinent ethnological phenomena as well as conceptions exist
ing with respect to them is the merit of the great Catholic
anthropologist, W. Schmidt, in his monumental work, Der Ursprung der Gottesidee (1912-36) .
3T Fr. Schmidt believes that
his data point to a primitive monotheism, which has gradually
degenerated, leaving only widely scattered supreme beings and
high gods to bear witness to it. He has also worked out an
elaborate but subjective system according to which, he believes,
primitive monotheism evolved into the various theological pat
terns found in primitive cultures of today. Among the most
influential and independent historians of religion who have been strongly influenced in their views by Schmidt may be men
tioned especially R. Pettazzoni and N. SSderblom, the latter of
whom is followed by an increasing number of younger scholars,
especially in Scandinavia. 38 German students of comparative
religion, such as C. Clemen and F. Pfister, generally oppose
Schmidt, though they have made many minor concessions to his
position.
39 Mediating views are held by such authorities as G.
van der Leeuw and K. Beth, both of whom emphasize the
dynamistic nature of primitive religion, which had previously found one of its chief exponents in Beth (see above) .
40 It has
been particularly interesting to see the reaction of American
anthropologists, nearly all of whom oppose Schmidt in his main
thesis, though accepting many of his ideas in detail. As a matter of fact, it is often very difficult to distinguish sharply
between dynamism and personalism, where a cosmic deity is concerned. There can no longer be any doubt that Fr. Schmidt has suc
cessfully disproved the simple evolutionary progression first set up by the positivist Comte, fetishism polytheism monothe
ism, or Tylor's animism polytheism monotheism. Nor can Marett's correction to pre-animism (dynamism) animism
polytheism monotheism escape radical modification. The sim
ple fact is that religious phenomena are so complex in origin
and so fluid in nature that over-simplification is more misleading in the field of religion than perhaps anywhere else. Moreover,
as has been stressed above, we must not forget the lapse of



126 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
over 100,000 years since the first Mousterian burials. During
so long a period many evolutionary tendencies undoubtedly completed their cycles, returning to stages which were often superficially like their starting points. Moreover, in Chapter I
we have already stressed the principles of imitation, adapta
tion, and skeuomorphism, as a result of whose operation arti
facts and institutions can be totally divorced from their primary
function when they are borrowed by another people, or when they continue in use among a given people after environmental conditions have been radically altered. Above (pp. 92 ff.) have been mentioned a number of the
principal phenomena of the Stone Age which bear on religion.
Thanks to the latest investigations of such men as Baron von
Richthofen (1932),41 F. R. Lehmann (1938) 42 and others, we
are now in a good position to distinguish clearly between certain, probable, and doubtful deductions. It is certain that the
belief in an after-life has a very long prehistory, going back
in some form as far as the Neanderthal men of the Mousterian
age. Moreover, this belief developed to an extraordinary degree
in the Neolithic, as we know especially from the megalithic monuments of the Old World. Just what physiological and
psychological sources it had, we can hardly demonstrate, though
we may safely stress various contributory factors, such as em
pirically discovered sanitary requirements, fear of the spirit of
the deceased (whose existence was inferred from dreams),
affection for the dead, and general inability to distinguish sharply between dead and living men, so far as the dynamistic operation of their spirits was concerned.
We have also mentioned the evidence from Magdalenian and
later ages for dynamistic conceptions. Among the hunters of the latest European Palaeolithic the flowering of imitative
aesthetic powers led to dynamistic practices such as the portrayal
of the animals which they hunted, sometimes representing them with missiles sticking in their bodies, and of mimetic dances,
where men put on animal masks. In the subsequent Neolithic
and Chalcolithic of the Near East, we find plastic models of domesticated animals, phalli, and the like, sometimes in close
connection with sanctuaries. The existence of such models can
hardly be separated from the fact that the physical basis for



PRAEPARATIO 127
existence had in the interim been shifted from hunting to
animal husbandry. Since it is sometimes still insisted that small models of animals were already made for children's use as toys,
it must be emphasized that the evidence from the early Near
East is more and more strongly opposed to this interpretation,
so far as the Bronze Age is concerned.43 By the Iron Age it is
quite certain that many plastic models were only intended as
toys and in Egypt we can demonstrate such use still earlier. Children doubtless played just as much in the Stone Age as in
the Iron, but their toys remained simple, like those of savages
today; the magical possibilities of models made them seem as dangerous for children as electric toys actually are today.
With the discovery of agriculture and animal husbandry in the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods religion became still more
complex. The triad of plastic statues from the Neolithic of Jericho suggests that the divine triads of the ancient Near East,
usually consisting of father, mother, and son,44 were already
known by the sixth millennium B. C, and that they were already worshipped with the aid of a shrine and rites of some sort It
was in this general age that the mythology and cultic symbolism
which we associate with the gods of fertility must have been
developed, since we find them full-grown in the early third millennium though not so crystallized in form as they appear later in the Adonis-Attis-Osiris and similar cycles.
The decorative art of the Chalcolithic is very instructive when compared with Magdalenian and mesolithic art. The imitative
aesthetic capacity of palaeolithic man some 20,000 years ago was already highly evolved, though there is no need to suppose
that the heights reached by Cro-Magnon man were equalled
anywhere else by his contemporaries. The Natufian man of
Palestine, many thousands of years later, was ahead of his
Magdalenian precursor so far as art in the round was concerned.
But in the chalcolithic cultures of Halaf, Susa, and Jericho about 4000 B. C. we find an extraordinary development of the
imaginative-aesthetic powers of man, resulting in astonishingly
complex geometrical designs and fantastic figures of dragons which carry us into the realm of phantasmagoria. It is very
doubtful whether man's artistic capabilities are actually any
higher today than they were in late prehistoric times, though



128 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
the number of motifs, techniques, and media available to him
now is, of course, immeasurably greater. When we bear in
mind also that mythology must have been developed during the Late Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic Ages, as shown both by the intrinsic nature of mythology and
by its distribution in history and geography, this flowering of
man's imaginative powers becomes very significant. We can
say with confidence that the amount of mythological lore current in the latest prehistoric age was far greater than the residue
which was still known in the ancient Near East about 2000 B. C. Quite aside from all deductive evidence is the fact that a great many myths which are referred to in the Pyramid Texts and the Surnerian literature of the third millennium vanish without
leaving any traces in later times. In other words, the same process of selection operated here as in other bodies of material
which are orally transmitted.
To work out a chronological scheme for the origin and evolution of mythology is a thankless task and one which can
probably never be satisfactorily accomplished in detail. Yet some things are already clear. Studied in the light of their
geographical diffusion certain creation-myths and especially the myth of the Great Flood appear as among the oldest religious inheritances of mankind, since they are found among primitive tribes in both continents and as far from the foci of migration as southern South America. As is well known, recent ethno
graphical, geological, and archaeological research has proved
that the prehistoric settlement of the New World proceeded by way of Alaska and was a long process, which began at the end of the Palaeolithic or in the early Mesolithic, and was finished
many thousands of years ago, except possibly for the Eskimo
migration. The story of the Great Flood must, therefore, go back like other American Indian cultural inheritances to an
age preceding the Neolithic of Asia, and possibly antedating the Mesolithic.
Additional light on the antiquity of religious expression and
thought is shed by linguistic science. We do not wish to return
to the day, over two generations ago, when Max Miiller de
clared that "
mythology is a disease of language." However, the
importance of linguistics for the history of religion is very great.



PRAEPARATIO 129
What we have said about the prehistoric climax of creative
mythology is closely paralleled by the facts of language. It is
now quite certain that language had developed in prehistoric
times to a degree of elaborateness which is seldom or never
found among living languages. Thus we know that Proto-Indo
European was more complex in its structure than any of its
living descendants, except possibly Lithuanian. We are also learning today, since the decipherment of Middle Canaanite and
the development of comparative Hamito-Semitic philology, that
this was also true of parent Semitic. The same phenomenon
appears whenever we compare a living language with a known
progenitor; cf. English, French, modern Arabic of any dialect, Hindi, etc. It is certain, for instance, that Sumerian had broken
down phonetically to an extraordinary degree by the late third
millennium B. C, just as .has been shown by B. Karlgren to be
true of modem Chinese. Many of the cliches which have become popular in the past
few decades with respect to language are false. It is, for ex
ample, not true that primitive man was incapable of abstraction.
It is quite true that logical and philosophical abstraction were
foreign to him. If we turn again, however, to the ancient Near
East and study the situation in the earliest periods which we can
reach through inscriptions or by linguistic methods, we find
extended power of prelogical abstraction. The earliest known
stages of the Egyptian, Sumerian and Semitic languages show
that general qualities, such as "
goodness, truth, purity," could be abstracted from the related adjectives and identified as
abstractions by some linguistic device such as suffix, prefix, or
internal vowel change. Moreover, such formations were known
before Egyptian separated from her Semitic sisters, i. e., at least
5000 B. C. Classificatory generalizations, such as " mankind,"
were equally familiar at just as remote an age. All the "
proto
metaphysical
"
conceptions which are known to the cultural
anthropologist from ethnological investigation are found in the
earliest Near East. Tabu is represented by the Sumerian nig-gig
and related conceptions elsewhere; the polar development of
" holiness " and " abomination " from the concept of inviola
bility or untouchability is well attested.45 The dynamistic power known to ethnologists by the term mana, etc., survives in traces



130 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
and has been shown by Beth to inhere in the term W, which
means "
god, God, divine power
" in Semitic, and perhaps also
in Egyptian ntr,
"
god." 46 The external soul is represented in
Egypt by the ku* (" ka").47 A precursor of the Indo-Iranian
arta and even of the Platonic idea is found in the Sumerian
gisb-gbar, the outline, plan, or pattern of things-which-are-to-be, designed by the gods at the creation of the world and fixed in heaven in order to determine the immutability of their crea
tion.48 The Sumerians also had substantially the same ideas
about fate or destiny (nam-tar] which we later find among the Greeks. Long before the fourth millennium men presumably applied
to their religion the habits of thinking which we have described.
By 3000 B. C. it is absolutely certain that they had. Using their
native powers of abstracting and classifying, they had abstracted
the idea of the " divine " from " divine being(s) ," and they had
associated this " divine "
category with all qualities which they
knew to be good in social relations. Similarly they had asso
ciated the " divine "
category with power and with the act of
creation. The empirical necessity of a single head for any com
plex organization had led them to infer a single power behind the complex manifestations of the universe. This power appears in various forms and with various limitations, but in each case a high god is head of the cosmos to his worshippers. So it
is with the Egyptian Ree
, properly the sun-god; so it is with the
Sumerian An, the god of heaven, at Erech, or En-lil,
" lord of
the storm," at Nippur and elsewhere; so it is with the con
temporary Dyeus-Pater,
" father sky," of the Indo-Europeans,
from whom the daughter peoples derived their Jupiter, their Zeus pater, and their Dyauf pita** Each of these high gods is the embodiment of goodness and power to his votaries though
we must remember that goodness was limited by its social connotations and that there might be rival aspirants for power.
2. Egyptian Religion between 3000 and 1600 B. C.
Just as Mesopotamia is unique in its importance for the
history of ancient civilization, so Egypt stands alone in its
significance for the study of ancient religion. The relative isolation of the Nile Valley and the conservatism that came from



PRAEPARATIO 131
physical uniformity and the stability of institutions, combined
to make Egypt the most conservative of countries in its religion.
It has well been said that the Egyptians, like newly hatched
chicks, carried their egg-shells around on their backs, i. e., they
preserved outworn customs and beliefs long after they had
become wholly incongruous in their new setting. This peculi
arity, which differs rather strikingly from what we find in
Mesopotamia, is illustrated in the Pyramid Texts (see above,
p. 116) ; it is still present in the native religion of the Roman
age. Our principal source for the earliest religion of dynastic Egypt is the corpus of Pyramid Texts, supplemented by miscel
laneous data from a great many inscriptions, mostly of later date but incorporating older material. Thanks to the work of K.
Sethe and others we can thread our way through the labyrinth
of early Egyptian religion with steadily increasing confidence. It must be emphasized strongly that all schematizations of
the religion of the most ancient Egyptians are misleading.50 It is clear that nothing quite like the types of totemism known
from Australia, Africa, or America had ever existed in Egypt,
though it possessed the raw materials out of which some form of totemism might have evolved. Nearly all the local gods,
each of whom was revered in a town or district (from which
arose the later system of forty-two nomes) were represented in
animal form, as we know from later idols, hieroglyphs, and allusions in Egyptian religious literature. Many of these divini
ties were believed to be incarnated in some special individual
beast, such as the Apis bull which became so well known in
later centuries. To many of these animal gods all representa
tives of their species were sacred, whence arose restrictions in
food, of which we hear more and more in late times. But
there does not appear to be a trace in early texts of specifically
totemistic phenomena such as consanguinity, exogamy, and the
like. Moreover, not all gods were specially connected with
animals ; some were conceived as trees, as human beings, or as inanimate objects, and some might be represented in a number
of different ways, often quite contradictory from the standpoint of modern civilized man. It is a mistake to suppose that most, if not all, the Egyptian gods began as local numina, often as
totems or fetishes. Before the Egyptians settled down as tillers



132 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
of the soil in the Nile Valley, more than 7000 years ago, they
must already have possessed complex religious beliefs, with high gods and lesser divinities, with elaborate mythologies and cult practices, like most of mankind, ancient and modern, in the neolithic stage of culture. This stage is reflected in Egypt by the
fact that a single god may be worshipped at a number of different places, geographically far apart. It is also reflected by the wide diffusion of the cult of such cosmic deities as the
sun-god Ree
, who can hardly have been originally a local god, since his very name means simply
"
sun, day." A striking characteristic of local Egyptian pantheons is the popularity of triads formed by father, mother, and son (as in neolithic Jericho), many of which were found in different parts of the
country. The expansion of the triads to enneads, or groups of
three triads, is in certain cases known to be very early, going back into predynastic times.
A remarkable link between primitive and sophisticated re
ligious thought is provided by the so-called "monument of
Memphite theology/' copied by the Egyptians in later times,
but which must go back to proto-dynastic times, as shown by
Breasted, Erman, and Sethe. 51 According to this text, Ptah, the head of the Memphite ennead, is the creator and source of its
other eight deities. From the union of the second and third of
these successively created gods sprang Atum, the chief god of
Heliopolis. Atum was the demiurge, through whose creative word everything was created: /' and every divine word came into
being through that which the heart thought and the tongue
commanded"; and further, "when the eyes see and the ears hear and the nose breathes air, they carry (what they have
received) to the heart (which decides what to do) and the
tongue utters (the commands) ." Ptah, moreover, is represented in this text as continuing to create, since whatever the other
gods did they did as manifestations of him. " It came to pass
that heart and tongue obtained the power over every member
(of the body), teaching that (Ptah) was in every breast and in every mouth, of all gods, all men, all beasts, all creeping things,
while he (Ptah) thinks and commands whatever he wishes/*
In this Memphite system from about 3000 B. C. we find primi
tive dynamism in the form of the creative word, primitive cor



PRAEPARATIO 133
porative psychology in the conflation of the personalities of the different gods, the conception of the impersonal high god in the
figure of Ptah. At the same time there are very definite signs
of theological speculation in the treatment of the ennead, in
the fact that Ptah is made superior to the Heliopolitan Atum,
as well as in numerous details of the text. We shall have occasion to say more later about the dynamistic and creative
function of the word in the ancient Orient.
Cruder, but not necessarily more primitive, than the Mem
phite cosmogony is that of Heliopolis itself. The son-god Atum
came into existence 52 in the primordial fresh-water ocean Nun (Hebrew tehom) , before heaven and earth had been created. In
the Nun he found no place to stand, until he mounted a hill and ascended (as the sun) on the bnbn stone in Heliopolis.
Then he found that he was alone and in order to create a com
panion he masturbated, whereupon he conceived and vomited
forth the god Shu (air) and the goddess Tefnet, from whose
marital intercourse were born Geb and Nut (earth and heaven) ,
parents of the two pairs Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys.
During the great Pyramid Age more and more attention was
focussed on the person of the reigning monarch and on prepara
tions for his future life as a god in heaven or in an elysium beneath the First Cataract of die Nile. This emphasis on the
king's future is not surprising when we recall that the Egyptians
already paid far more attention, relatively speaking, to their tombs and graves than did any other ancient people of historic
times. In this respect they continued and exaggerated the neolithic tradition. Moreover, Pharaoh was the incarnation of the god Ree
, of the falcon-god Horus (also a solar divinity) , and in proto-historic times he became the incarnation of Osiris.
Not least, he was head of one of the most absolute monarchies that the world has perhaps ever known at least this was true
in the early Memphite period, down to the end of the Fourth
Dynasty. An equivalent royal attention to the hereafter meant,
therefore, that the power of the state was concentrated on the
building of the royal tomb and mortuary temple. Thanks to the fact that the last kings of the Memphite period inscribed
the mortuary ritual of their predecessors on the walls of their
tomb-chambers, we have an unequalled body of evidence for
10



134 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
their beliefs (see above, p. 116). The standing theme, repeated
over and over with innumerable variations, is that the king is
not dead but still lives. In logical (but not prelogical) contra
diction to the solar traits of Pyramid mythology are the Osirian,
since Osiris represented the vegetation of the Nile Valley, which
dL s in the early summer, when dead is submerged under the
life-giving Nile inundation, and comes to life again as the
inundation subsides. The home of Osiris is in the fresh-water ocean of the underworld, whence the Nile rose at the First
Cataract, according to primitive Egyptian conceptions. Therefore the king not only sets and rises again with Re' and Horus, but he also dies and comes to life again with Osiris. At the same time his living spirit emerges from the mouth of the tomb
and flies straight to the never-dying (never-setting) circumpolar
stars. One spell represents the king as flying to heaven as a
heron, as a falcon, as a locust; another one has him climbing a
celestial stairway, rising with the fragrance of incense, flying as a bird, riding in the solar bark as a dung-beetle. Cruder primitive ideas are recalled by an extraordinary hymn which exhibits
the dead king as a gross cannibal, devouring the limbs of the
gods as they are cooked for him in a pot in the northern heavens. In this archaic document the constellation Orion appears as the father of the gods. Countless myths are alluded
to, but few are recited in detail, since the Pyramid Texts are not
a series of mythological epics but of spells, incantations, and
hymns. Through all there breathes the prelogical, dynamistic,
corporative breath of primitive humanity. From Egyptian religious soil early in the third millennium B. C. might have
arisen a Hindu pantheism like that of the pre-philosophical Brahmanas if corporative tendencies had prevailed, or a solar monotheism like that of the Aten, if individualizing tendencies
had won the victory. The latter ultimately triumphed for a
brief interlude, more than a thousand years later, but the time
had not yet come in the early third millennium, since primitive modes of thought were too strong and impersonal dynamism
had to be effectively replaced by a more systematic and a more personal stage of mentality in dominant circles before a true monotheism could arise. When the darkness of the First Intermediate Age descended



PRAEPARATIO 135
upon Egypt in the 22nd century B.C. high culture suffered temporary eclipse, old traditions were neglected, and the ancient
customs fell into desuetude. As often again in the recorded history of man, it seemed to thinkers that all worth-while pos
sessions of humanity had been lost in the general catastrophe
of civilization, when art, literature, and religion were negle^ |ed
and men lost interest in everything except their immediate needs
and wants. But this rude and untutored age, this stirring and
dramatic period of falling princes and rising commoners, of
war, terror, and barbarian irruption, provided the needed ca
tharsis through which civilization could be freed from' its time
honored, but suffocating inheritance and start afresh. And the fresh start took place on a new plane of mental attainment,
following a thousand years of organized and self-conscious
historical life. As in contemporary Babylonia we emerge toward
the end of the third millennium from a stage where prelogical,
dynamistic thought held almost undisputed sway over priests
and leaders of men into a stage where the best thought was
essentially logical, though still empirical and pre-philosophical.
From now on primitive logic and dynamism tended to be restricted increasingly to the realm of magic and folklore, from
which they emerged at disconcerting intervals as they still
do to warn men of the empirico-logical age that they could never quite lose the instinctive reactions of their savage
ancestors.
Among the most significant literary documents of antiquity
are the didactic and gnomic works of the outgoing Old and the
Middle Empire. So far as preserved they begin with the Maxims of Ptah-hotpe, vizier of Izezi (Assa) , which were composed not
later than the 23rd century B. G, and they continue down to about the 19th century. The Maxims of Ptah-hotpe and another nearly contemporary work are characteristic in diction and
attitude of the late Old Empire, where stability was traditional
and where shrewd aphorisms and wise counsels were in constant
demand on the part of persons ambitious for preferment. These
aphorisms are often noble and always worldly: doing right and
acting justly are necessary to success and will bring prosperity
if combined with prudence. It is very significant that there is no
reference to a special god. The worldly and perhaps slightly



136 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
cynical teacher may have recognized that gods and divine mani
festations of the all-father Rec or Atum or Khnum were alike,
so far as man's relation to them might be concerned. " The
god " referred to by Ptah-hotpe may, however, always be the
king. Next among dated works seems to be the Instruction for
Merikere, a Heracleopolitan king who reigned about 2100 B. C. This work, whose date is certain, is invaluable for our
knowledge of political, social, and religious life in the latter
part of the First Intermediate of Egypt. The rules for a success
ful life remain, of course, approximately the same, but there is
a very different spirit in important respects. The disillusionment
produced by a long period of anarchy brings with it a loss of faith in the necessary connection between traditional religion
and morality, on the one hand, and success, on the other. The god knows everything and punishes his enemies and those who rebel against his commands, at the same time that he rewards
his friends and those who obey him. However, " the good
conduct of the righteous man is more acceptable than the (sacri
ficial) ox of the evil-doer," an admonition that reminds one forcibly of the attitude of Isaiah and Jeremiah some fourteen centuries later. In contrast to this is a skeptical attitude toward
the recompense of good in this world; divine service becomes rather a means to bring happiness in the next world than an
instrument for ensuring immediate satisfaction in this one. Of
unusual interest, showing how close to monotheism individual Egyptian thinkers must have come in the late third millennium,
are the following words of the text: " One generation gives way
to another and (the) god, who knows the natures (of things) ,
conceals himself . . . Honor (the) god in his way, (honor)
him who is made of precious stones and formed of copper, just as water takes the place of water. There is no stream that can be hidden; it breaks through the dyke by which it is hidden."
These somewhat enigmatic sentences are clarified by the meta
phor which closes them. The invisible, unknowable deity, who
himself knows everything, acts as continuously as flowing water
and as irresistibly as the Nile inundation. Divine cult and adoration of images are necessary, but they must not blind us to the reality behind the barriers of the senses. Here we find,



PRAEPARATIO 137
possibly for the first time in our sources, conscious and explicit statement of the fluid concept of dynamism, which had previ
ously been unconscious and implicit. In the process of clarifying the conception by analogy, the Egyptian thinker of 4000 years
ago stood on the shifting boundary between dynamism, on the
one hand, and pantheism or monotheism, on the other. One is
vividly reminded of the part played by the principle of Tao in
the system of Lao-tze, some fifteen hundred years later. A step
in the direction of divine immanence would have led the Egyp
tian to the semi-pantheism of the apocryphal saying of Jesus
from Oxyrhynchus (cir. 200 A. D.):
"
. . . Lift the stone and there shalt thou find Me; cleave the wood and there am I." A
step in the direction of personalizing God might have led him
to true monotheism. To about the same time belong the pessimistic and misan
thropic poems known as the Song of the Harper and the Dialogue of a Misanthrope with his Soul, both antedating the
rise of the Middle Empire. The Song of the Harper is frankly
cynical and hedonistic: the dead, both kings and commoners,
rest in their tombs and none ever returns from beyond the
grave; the wise man will, therefore, enjoy life to the full, not
worrying about the day of death. The Dialogue of a Misanthrope with his Soul has been convincingly elucidated by A.
Scharff (1937),53 who has cleared away a number of ambigui
ties and uncertainties of previous interpreters. The author of this remarkable poem has well been called by Pieper
" the first
great poet of world-literature." Briefly stated, the poem con
tains a colloquy between a man who is so weary of life that he
plans to commit suicide and his soul (Egyptian akhu) , which
tries to dissuade him from such a rash step. Alternately, each
presents his case, the man painting the misery and suffering on earth and the bliss of life with the gods in the other world, and his soul pointing out that the after-life is a vain hope
and that the duty of man is to enjoy life on earth as fully as
possible, since there is nothing after it. Finally the man con
vinces his soul that death is really better than life, whereupon his soul bids him throw himself into the fire in order that he may
reach that bliss which the man has portrayed in such glowing colors. In keeping with the exaltation of the poet's spirit is the



138 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
picture which he draws of life in the other world, where the
deceased becomes a "
living god " himself, punishing evil-doers, occupying the bark of the sun-god and helping to distribute its
good things to earthly temples, engaging in unhindered conversation with Re* himself.
The so-called " Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage
" also belongs to the First Intermediate period and is intermediate in
type between the pessimistic compositions which we have described and the Prophecy of Nefer-rehu, from the Twelfth
Dynasty. The sage, Ipu-wer, paints in drastic terms the terrible
conditions existing in Egypt, where everything is in confusion,
with contempt for and neglect of everything noble and good, accompanied by elevation of the ignoble and bad. After long
enumerations of the evil things that have come -upon the land
during the reign of an aging king (whose name is not men
tioned) , he tells the latter that a good time will come, when
the Egyptians, aided by negroes and Hamitic tribes of the south, will drive out the Asiatics (evidently referring to the triumph
of the Thebans over the north) . Much of this important com
position is so badly preserved that it is dangerous to make
further deductions. Somewhat later is the Prophecy of Nefer
rehu, which is extremely interesting as the oldest certain example of a vaticmtum ex eventu^ since it purports to date from the reign of Snefru of the Fourth Dynasty, but describes in some detail events from the reign of Ameni (Amenemmes), the founder of the Twelfth Dynasty, six centuries later. It also begins with a dismal portrayal of conditions before this dynasty,
after which it predicts the coming of " a king from the south,
named Ameni, the son of a Nubian woman . . . who will receive the crown of Upper Egypt and will assume the crown of
Lower Egypt, who will unite the double crown ..." It goes on to describe the principal events of his reign and to promise a
return of justice and prosperity to the country. Among the most striking results of the feudal age and the social upheaval of the First Intermediate Age is the extension of the future prerogatives of the king to nobles and the well-to-do
generally.
54 The Coffin Texts of the Middle Empire contain many incantations and hymns from the Pyramid Texts, which
are no longer applied solely to the king. At the same time there



PRAEPARATIO 139
are interesting changes. The Osirianizing process which had
already set in strongly in the Pyramid Age now tends to domi
nate the hereafter, though the conflation of the mythology and
symbolism of Osiris with those of Re4 leads to most incongruous
results. The apparent contradiction did not disturb the ordinary
Egyptian, who was doubtless equally happy to expect a blissful
life with Re' in heaven or with Osiris in the nether world. Like
the unthinking man of today, who is often promised just as
conflicting things by the demagogue, so the Egyptian felt that
the future would in any case be safer if there were more and
better assurances. The Coffin Texts show another tendency
which makes the increasing incongruity of mortuary theology
easier to understand. When compared to the Pyramid Texts
on the one hand and the Book of the Dead on the other, we
note that they approach the latter more and more closely in
reflecting the fears of the common people with respect to the
traditional dangers of the journey to Elysium. More and more they become simple magical charms, with all the inner contra
diction that magic usually exhibits. The prevailing dynamism of the Pyramid Texts becomes magic before our eyes, and it thus diverges increasingly from the route followed by the evolu
tion of religion. Another and no less interesting result of the social upheaval
of the First Intermediate, was a change and development in the ideals of social justice. There has been a great deal of erroneous emphasis laid on the evolution of social justice in the ancient
world, suggesting that the idea is comparatively recent, or even
that it tended more and more to replace religion in the proper
sense. Actually no community, primitive or modern, can long exist without a body of customary law regulating the relations
between its members, or without a spirit of helpfulness and cooperation which protects the weaker members of the group
and strengthens mutual loyalty. This characteristic of group
life strikes deep root in the animal world and is found among
all vigorous primitive societies of today. In the Pyramid Age
we find both tomb biographies and aphorisms stressing the virtues of hospitality, kindness to inferiors, and charity to the poor
and helpless. Impartial justice is essential to kings and magis
trates. In the First Intermediate and the following Middle



140 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Empire there is an extraordinary increase in the attention paid
to social justice, a fact that again illustrates the profound catharsis which was effected by the upheavals of the late third
millennium in Egypt. As a striking example of justice, we are
referred to the vizier Achthoes (Kheti) , whose name shows that
he belongs to the First Intermediate, not to the Pyramid Age as
supposed by Breasted. Of him it was said in later times that
he decided against his own kindred, even when justice was on
their side, in order that he might not be suspected of partiality.
This, later Egyptians consider as " more than justice/' Among the many pleas for justice to the poor and oppressed, none is so impressive as the story of the Eloquent Peasant, referring to
events of the Heracleopolitan period and probably composed
before the end of the First Intermediate Age. Here we read of
a peasant who was arbitrarily and brutally robbed by an official
but who went to the court and so eloquently pled his case that
the king granted him justice. Both theme and rhetorical style were so popular that the work was copied and recopied in later times.
The foregoing pages have shown how religion and thought evolved in Egypt during a period of over a millennium. This evolution began in the age of dynamism and carried religion forward into a stage where it seemed to be on the point of
developing into pantheism or into monotheism, but where polytheism and magic were still dominant among the masses. By
the early second millennium both theology and ethics were being studied and expounded. Such branches of knowledge as
mathematics,55 surveying, and medicine were being logically
formulated and systematized. The prelogical age was coming to a close.
3. Mesopotamian Religion between 3000 and 1600 B. C.
The history of early Mesopotamia was so disturbed and its
cultural evolution was so complex when compared to Egypt
that its religious development is neither so clear nor so instruc
tive as that of the latter. The religion of the Sumerians was already much farther advanced on the whole than that of the
Egyptians at the beginning of our period, and it remained in
some respects more primitive at its end. Sumero-Accadian poly



PRAEPARATIO 141
theism was much more clear-cut and consistent than was con
temporary Egyptian, and the dynamistic plane of thought was
more sharply restricted to the domain of magic. The develop
ment of magic was also far advanced, and its association with embryonic science was so intimate as to make it virtually im
possible to make a clear separation between them.
When we compare the politico-religious organization of Babylonia at the beginning of the third millennium with that of
proto-dynastic Egypt, a pronounced difference immediately
appears. Whereas Egypt was broken up into dozens of districts,
arranged end to end down the Nile, Babylonia was divided into a relatively small number of city-states, distributed not only
along the two rivers but also located between them, thanks to several connecting water-courses. The country as a whole was,
therefore, more compact and there was much less cultural and
religious particularism. The gods worshipped in one place
were generally also recognized in adjacent towns, and recur in the pantheons of towns in other parts of the country. At first
blush, the total number of gods is alarming. The lists from
Shuruppak (Tell Farah) in central Babylonia, copied about
2700 B. C, name over 700 gods and we have no assurance that
we possess all of the lists. The vastly less complete material
from the 29th or 28th century at Ur in southern Babylonia
yields over forty names of deities.56 Throughout Babylonia the
Sumerians seem to have agreed on placing An (literally
" heaven," originally
"
high ") at the head of the pantheon with En-lil (" lord of the storm ") next to him. In the archaic
tablets from Erech, dating from before 3200 B. C (see above,
p. 100) we find, of course, the names of An and his consort
Inanna (literally
" mistress of heaven "), who were already the
chief deities of the city, as they remained for over 3000 years, down to the abandonment of the site in Parthian times. In
the slightly later tablets from Jemdet Nasr in northern Baby
lonia En-lil frequently appears. In Lagash, about 2500 B. C., Entemena dedicates a votive inscription to En-lil,
"
king of the
lands (km, "
foreign country," not kalam, " land of Babylonia"), father of the gods," and calls Nin-girsu, the chief
god of Lagash,
" warrior of En-lil." From the earliest historical
times En-liTs cult centre, Nippur in central Babylonia, was re



142 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
garded as a neutral, sacred city, which was never a dynastic centre and to which votive offerings were sent from different
parts of the country. In later times the Babylonians were to
identify Marduk, chief god of Babylon, with En-lil and still
later the Assyrians were to equate him with their national deity,
Assur. In fact the name became synonymous with belu,
" lord "
(Canaanite ba'al) . Illustrations of the stability and relative homogeneity of the
Sumerian pantheon may be multiplied with ease. The principal
members of the divine hierarchy had their places already
marked out almost as rigidly in early Sumerian times, as we
know from the lists of Shuruppak and the inscriptions of
Lagash, as they were in the early second millennium, from which date the great lists of gods, which remained canonical
down to the end of Babylonian history. In this respect the early Babylonian pantheon reminds one strikingly of the Greek, with En-lil playing the role of Zeus and, like him, being considered
as the father of gods and men and as ruler of the whole earth.
Of course, in practice there was at least as much variation in
function, genealogy, and mythology of the gods as there was in classical Greece. Yet it can hardly be denied that Babylonia and Greece came the closest of any known countries to setting up
an organized polytheistic system. The influence of the Babylonian system upon the neighboring lands of Western Asia was
very great, as we shall see.
When we turn to unilingual Sumerian religious texts from
the late third millennium, chiefly from Nippur, we find that a large number of the divine names of the lists were simply
liturgical appellations and that their bearers were not con
sidered in general as distinct deities. This is very well illus
trated in the Uttu myth, published in 1915 by S. H. Langdon, but not understood until more recently. Here the relations of
the god En-ki (" lord of the earth " or " lord of the under
world ") with a whole series of goddesses are described in such
a way that the identity of the latter is certain. The names are
fortunately all common and all transparent: Nin-sikilla is " the
Lady of the Pure . . . "; Nin-tud is "the Lady who Gives
Birth "; Damgal-nunna is
" the Great Spouse of the Prince ";
Nin-ghursag is "the Lady of the Mountain"; Nin-kurra is



PRAEPARATIO 143
" the Lady of the Highland." Other illustrations are provided
in great numbers by the liturgies. This phenomenon certainly
points to increasing syncretism and to a monolatrous tendency,
where the worshipper concentrated his adoration on a single
deity, with whom he identified all other gods of the same type,
but S. H. Langdon was hardly justified in considering it as a
close approach to monotheism.57 Tribal or national henotheism (on which see Chapter IV)
does not seem to appear in any cuneiform religious sources from
our age (3000-1600 B. C). On the contrary, the cosmic gods
of Mesopotamia were naively and unquestioningly believed to
rule the entire world, each in his own designated sphere or
function. The following excerpt from a Sumerian text extant in a copy of about the nineteenth century B. C. well illustrates
the prevailing attitude, as it is expressed or taken for granted in thousands of documents:
" Unto Enlil do foreign lands raise their eyes
(in adoration) , Unto Enlil do foreign lands pay homage.
The Four Quarters (of the earth) bloom like
a garden for
It would be hard to find more forcible statement of the uni
versality of Enlil's dominion in a document of the empirico
logical age. 58
Whereas in early Egypt, as we have seen, nearly all the gods are definitely associated with special animals or plants, there is
hardly a single clear case in Sumerian Babylonia. To be sure,
there are abundant signs of an older stage in which the boundary between animals, men, and gods was fluid: for
example, there are a few gods who bear the name of an animal,
such as Gud, the bull-god, Shaghan, the serpent-god; there are
numerous hymns in which a god is compared to some animal
or animals, but they are generally clear similes, as when Nin-gizzida is addressed as a bull and a dragon in successive
lines. Sumerian deities are nearly always anthropomorphic. On the other hand, where in Egypt there is generally a clear de
marcation between the sexes of the gods (except in a few



144 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
androgynous deities such as Hapi, the Nile), among the Sumerians the sex of the divinity is often a matter of secondary
importance and a number of deities are alternately or simul
taneously male and female. This is particularly true, as we
shall see, of deities in the Tammuz cycle, but even the moon-god
is addressed in successive lines of a very early hymn as "
mighty young bull . . . with lapis-lazuli beard . . . fruit which be
gets itself . . . womb which bears everything." The cult of
Tammuz undoubtedly goes back to the earliest Sumerian times,
like the parallel cult of Osiris in Egypt. His full name was in
Sumerian Dumu-zid-abzu, " the Faithful Son of the Subter
ranean (fresh-water) Ocean/' but he is also called in late Sumerian liturgies Nin-azu9
" Lord of Healing," Sataran (the
serpent-goddess), Ama-ushumgal-anna,
" the Mother Python of
Heaven," etc., etc. The father of Tammuz was named Nin
gizzida,
" the Lord of the Faithful Tree," and his mother was
called ZertuY, apparently meaning
"
young maiden," or perhaps
"
virgin."
59 The Tammuz liturgies are nearly all composed in a late dialectic form of Sumerian which was spoken in northern Babylonia in the second half of the third millennium B. C.
They deal at great length with the rape of Tammuz from his sister and wife, Geshtin-anna (literally,
" Vine of Heaven ") or
Nin-anna, later Inanna or Ninni (literally,
" Mistress of Heaven "), identified with the Accadian Ishtar. Tammuz was carried away into the underworld and all life on earth human,
animal, and plant languished and died. However, his sister penetrated into the nether world and succeeded in recovering
him, after being imprisoned three days and three nights.
60
There is a very interesting alternation in Babylonian mythological consciousness between the summer heat and the spring inundation as the cause of Tammuz's death; the inundation also brings him to life again. As a child he was said to lie in a
sunken boat and as he grew he lay in the submerged grain; as a
youth the flood carried him down into the subterranean ocean,
whence he was later transported to heaven. We lack space to
dwell on the cycle of Tammuz and to point out its many points of contact with other cycles of the dying god of fertility in the
Near East, nor is it necessary, since excellent spade-work has
been accomplished by Frazer, Baudissin, Langdon, and others.61



PRAEPARATIO 145
Since these cycles must strike root into the Neolithic Age as far
as animal husbandry is concerned and into the Chalcolithic in so far as they are connected with vegetation-spirits and the
inundation, we can hardly be surprised to find kaleidoscopic
variation in detail, together with an astonishing amount of simi
larity in general, between the Sumero-Accadian, Anatolian,
Canaanite, and Egyptian myths of this type. It is also clear that
conceptions which were originally associated with many differ
ent rites and deities have gradually been grouped around certain
gods in each cultural region: Tammuz in Mesopotamia, Osiris
in Egypt, Adonis in Syria and the later Hellenistic world, Attis in Asia Minor. This tendency of myths to cluster around selected figures is clearly due to the dramatic quality of the
cycles in question, which tended to spread and to oust or to absorb all rivals.
Before leaving the subject of Sumerian religion, it may be well to discuss a subject which will occupy us later and which
has generally been misunderstood the supposed Babylonian logos. Jensen, Langdon, and others have insisted on the high
development of an alleged system of metaphysics in early
Babylonia. We have already pointed out (p. 130) that one
aspect of this "
metaphysics/' the gish-ghar conception, belongs
to the domain of primitive dynamistic thought, though it may
be considered as a precursor of the Platonic idea. The second
aspect is that of the enem, or " word," translated into Accadian
as awatii)
" word." This enem is nearly always represented as the voice of the god En-lil,
" lord of the storm," which sweeps
destructively over cities and fields, over beasts and men. How
ever, since enem is written with the same ideogram as gu,
"
voice, thunder," it obviously meant primarily just that, as is established by its frequent alternation in the liturgies with ud,
" storm," defined as enem Ud-gu-de,
" the voice of the divine
Thunderstorm." 62 There is a striking parallel (published in 1938) in slightly later Canaanite mythology, where Baal, the
storm-god, creates the thunderbolt (baraqu) in order that men
may hear his word or command (kawatu Accadian awatu) .
63
However, it is clear that the dynamistic conception of " creative
word " is an essential part of the idea: thunder is the means by
which the all-father makes his creative commands known to



146 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
men. Sumerian enem is thus the most important ultimate source
of the New Testament conception of the logos, as has justly
been pointed out by the distinguished Catholic scholar, the late
L. Diirr, in a recent work (1938).64 The significant shift of
idea must have taken place before the Semites translated enem by awatu, and before the Sumerians themselves extended the
concept to Enzu, the moon-god, and other gods who had nothing directly to do with the storm.
In general it is hard to point out elements in the composite
Babylonian religion of about 2000 B. C. which are of Semitic,
rather than of Sumerian origin. To be sure, many names of
gods, such as Ishtar} Shamash (the sun-god), etc., are Semitic,
but their appellations and myths are nearly always of demonstrably Sumerian origin, and the same is increasingly true of their rituals. The infiltration of the Accadians seems to have been too slow and the superiority of Sumerian culture too marked to permit any vital contribution other than that of fresh and vigorous blood from the Semitic side. It is, of course, easy to point out differences between the Sumerian religious literature of the third millennium and the Accadian literature written in the so-called hymnal-epic dialect, which seems to have been spoken in northern Babylonia in the second
half of the third millennium, but we can never be sure whether these differences are attributable to a difference of race or simply to a new cultural age. At all events, it is certain that the Accadians borrowed Sumerian mythological cycles, such as that
of Gilgamesh, Lugal-banda, the Creation and Deluge, the Descent of Ishtar, Agushaya, etc., and transformed them into real epics, with a dramatic movement quite foreign to the long
winded, liturgical compositions of the earlier Sumerians (some
of which continued to be copied down to the end of the third
millennium and in a few cases much later) .
The union, stability, and prosperity brought to Babylonia by
Hammurabi about 1760 B. C. made it possible for scholars to devote themselves to learned pursuits with a singlemindedness and a continuity heretofore unknown. The following two cen
turies saw an extraordinary development of empirical scientific and scholarly interest, as is illustrated by many works on
philology, lexicography, astronomy, mathematics, and numerous



PRAEPARATIO 147
branches of magic and divination which were composed at that
time, frequently in a form which remained canonical throughout
later Mesopotamian history. While the Babylonians of this age
did not equal their Egyptian contemporaries in their literary and rhetorical sophistication or in their knowledge of practical
engineering and medicine, they surpassed them notably in less
useful, but more intellectual pursuits. For example, they de
veloped mathematics to the stage of being able to solve quadra
tic equations by the method of false position, employing a
technique which was in some respects identical with that of the
Greek algebraist Diophantus in the third century A. D.65 In astronomy they produced the great canonical list of stars and constellations and interested themselves in the movements of the planets, as we know from the Venus tables and other
sources.66 They arranged cuneiform signs, Sumerian and Acca
dian words and grammatical forms in great lists and dictionaries
which remained standard down to the latest times. They prepared elaborate compendia of various branches of divination
and magic, such as prediction by omens of every conceivable
kind (including astrology, hepatoscopy, lecanomancy, etc., etc.) , and such as exorcism of evil spirits by incantatory rites. In
theology the great list of the gods which was prepared by these early scholars also remained canonical. In short, they showed
such taste and talent for collecting and systematizing all recognized knowledge that Mesopotamian learning nearly stagnated for a thousand years thereafter. Since the principles employed
by these Babylonian scholars were no longer prelogical, but
were essentially logical, even though their logic was empirical and not analytical, the vast system produced by them exercised
an extraordinary influence on succeeding generations, not only in Mesopotamia but also in the whole of Western Asia.
Balaam, for example, was essentially a typical Mesopotamian
diviner, as pointed out by S. Daiches.67
Sumero-Accadian morality and ethics were fundamentally
much the same as Egyptian. Good and evil were recognized as
individually and socially effective. The gods, especially the
sun-god, are generally credited with higher standards than men.
Urukagina of Lagash, in the 25th century B. C, undertook to
reform the official corruption of his day and to check the



148 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
oppression of the poor, thus reestablishing the "
righteous laws of Nin-girsu,'' which had been violated by evil-doers. Begin
ning with the Third Dynasty of Ur we find references to royal
legislation, according to the "
just laws of the sun-god." The lofty standards attained by this legislation may be inferred from the last codification which it received, the Code of Hammurabi, cir. 1750 B. C. which was, as we know now, only the continuation of a series of Sumerian codes with the same formulation and point of view.
The Babylonians had become so accustomed to change and
civil disorder in the centuries from Sargon of Accad to Ham
murabi, that we nowhere find the burst of disillusionment and
misanthropy characteristic of Egypt after the 22nd century B. C.
That stage was to come much later in Mesopotamia. The nearest approach to it in this period is the interest in various
forms of primitivism, both chronological and cultural: in the
former type we find emphasis laid on a more blissful life in
hoary antiquity and in the latter we encounter a curious interest
in a simpler way of contemporary life. 68 The former is best illustrated in the myths of antediluvian times, including the Uttu
poem; the second is remarkably developed in the Old-Babylonian recension of the Gilgamesh Epic. Babylonian thought became strongly centered on this world, owing to the lack of
any expectation of a joyous life in the next, such as was created
in Egypt by the extension of royal rights and prerogatives to
commoners. More sophisticated thinkers, inclined to pessimism, stressed the impossibility of obtaining eternal life. This idea is
vividly expressed in the Accadian Gilgamesh Epic, which in this respect seems to offer a striking contrast to the older and more primitive Sumerian version. After the death of the erstwhile
wild man, Engidu, who has meanwhile become his bosom
friend, Gilgamesh is overtaken by a morbid fear of death,
which drives him to strange adventures and unparalleled hardships in his search for immortality a search which is almost but
not quite successful. In this epic the gloomy future of man
and the hero's fear of death are portrayed in strong colors, and a somewhat hedonistic way of life is inculcated. Thanks, however, to the very fact that their concept of future life was
negatively conditioned, the Babylonians were driven in later



PRAEPARATIO 149
centuries to a much more profound consideration of the
problem of divine justice and human suffering than we ever
find in Egypt. In Babylonia after 2000 B. C we also find a
pervasive idea of order and system in the universe, resulting in
large part from the tremendous effort devoted to the systemati
zation of knowledge and especially of divination (knowledge of
the future) , which surpasses anything found in Egypt.

CHAPTER IV
WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD . . .
(Hosea 11: 1)
In our analytical sketch of cultural and religious life in the
Near East we have now readied the stage at which the historical
memories of Israel begin to assume tangible form. According to the traditions preserved in the Priestly Document, Abraham left Mesopotamia on his way to Palestine some 645 years before
the Israelites left Egypt, that is, in the late 20th century B. C according to the most probable date of the Exodus. Unfortu
nately, there is no reliable test of the correctness of these
chronological traditions, since they have no precise link with
extra-biblical history. I we accept the probable hypothesis of
some connection between the Hebrew entrance into Egypt and
the Hyksos movement, and add three or four generations, we arrive at a date somewhere between 1900 and 1750 B, C. for
Abraham's migration. The Patriarchal Age of Hebrew history
would then fall somewhere in the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age in Palestine and during the late Middle Empire and
the Hyksos period in Egypt. We shall see that this interpretation of Israelite tradition fits exceedingly well into the frame
work of external history.
A. THE ANCIENT ORIENTAL BACKGROUND OF ISRAELITE ORIGINS
After some twelve or thirteen centuries of practically con
tinuous historical records in both Egypt and Babylonia, there is
a virtually complete interruption in the contemporary records
of Egypt and the lands of the Fertile Crescent. Thanks to the
Mari documents we can now fix the approximate date of events
in Mesopotamian history during the second millennium, with a
maximum error of a generation or so.1 The calendaric and astronomical researches o L. Borchardt have settled the chronology of Egypt after about 2000 B. C., with a maximum error of not over about seven years in the Middle Empire and almost
complete precision in the New Empire.
2 In the past few years
150



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 151
the discoveries o Borchardt and Farina have also fixed the
approximate chronology of the Hyksos Age.3 Contemporary Egyptian inscriptions almost vanish after about 1750 B. C. and do not resume their normal flow until about 1580; Babylonian
inscriptions fail us entirely after the fall of Babylon cir. 1600
and are almost completely lacking until after 1400 B. C. ; Assyrian records cease about 1780 and (except for a few short
inscriptions from cir. 1570-1520) do not appear again until
after 1450 B. C. There are hardly any contemporary Hittite
inscriptions of the Old Empire, but even later copies of early
documents in the archives of Khattusas break off about 1550
and contemporary inscriptions do not begin until after 1400 B. C. In short, it is certain that there was a catastrophic inter
ruption of the normal flow of ancient history. From later historical tradition and from a comparison of conditions before
the blank period with conditions after it we can now form a
fairly accurate general idea of what happened.
1. The Political and Cultural Background, 1600-1200 B. C.
In Egypt the strong Twelfth Dynasty was followed by a
period of virtual anarchy, during which several groups or families of kings successively obtained the upper hand, all for
ephemeral reigns. After about 1750 B. C. native Egyptian royal
inscriptions cease almost entirely. Then comes a very obscure phase in which princes with West-Semitic (Amorite or He
brew) names appear on scarabs. This phase was followed by
the Fifteenth Dynasty, which consisted of Semitic invaders
from Syria.
4 Thanks to G. Farina's reconstitution of the Turin
Papyrus
*
(1938) we know that it consisted of six kings and
lasted 108 years (according to the best recension of Manetho
it lasted 260 years!). The principal rulers of the Fifteenth Dynasty, Apophis I and Khayana, flourished in the 17th cen
tury; in the second half of the century the latter built up an
ephemeral empire, the extent of which may be guessed by
monuments of his which have turned up in places as far
remov&l as Babylonia and Crete. The Fifteenth Dynasty was
followed by a short but weak dynasty of foreign origin, under which the native Theban princes of Upper Egypt revolted,
waging persistent war against the foreigners until their capital,



152 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Avaris (later called Tanis) in the northeastern Delta, was
captured by Amosis I about 1560 B.C. 5 In later times the
Egyptians applied the term Hyksos, literally
"
princes of the shepherds/' to them, but this designation is probably a mistake for a phrase with nearly identical pronunciation, meaning
"
foreign chiefs, chiefs of a foreign country," applied to Palestinian and Syrian chiefs and princes in the literature of the
Middle Empire.
As a result of the Hyksos conquest of Egypt the Egyptian
social and political organization was transformed and hardly any traces of die native feudalism of the Middle Empire remained.
Military organization was entirely changed by the introduction of horse-drawn chariots and composite bows, and thenceforth
both the Egyptian chariotry and bowmen became famous. A great many Canaanite (Hebrew) words entered Egypt during
the Hyksos period and the following age, and with them came
Canaanite deities and Asiatic wares and arts. Most significant of all is the fact that the Egyptians lost much of their old
supercilious attitude to their Asiatic possessions, an attitude
which was equally characteristic of both the Old and the Middle Empire. Thereafter they celebrated their Asiatic victories and
the extent of their territory on every possible occasion. The
pharaohs entered into active diplomatic correspondence with the kings and princes of Asia, presumably following a Hyksos
precedent. To judge from the apparent total absence of letters
from Egypt in the Mari correspondence of the 18th century
B. C. such condescension had been unknown before.
Turning to Mesopotamia we find a much more complete
interruption of normal life than in Egypt. After the fall of
Babylon about 1600 B. C., northern Babylonia was conquered
by barbarian mountaineers from the southern Zagros mountains,
called the Kashshu, or Cossaeans, who gradually extended their sway over all southern Mesopotamia and ruled for some 450
years.
6 The country was transformed into a feudal state of strongly military character; the warlike Cossaean nobles were little interested in literature and learning, which seem to have
survived mainly in the south. It was not until the early 14th
century that business returned to its old contractual basis,
though with sweeping changes in custom and practice. Assyria



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 153
continued under native princes, but after cir. 1780 B. C. the
empire of Shamshi-Adad shrank to an insignificant district and
we hear nothing more about its political history for over three
centuries, though the list of kings is preserved. It would seem
that the onslaught of northern barbarians, about which we hear
occasionally in Babylonia after Hammurabi, finally over
whelmed Assyria and the other Mesopotamian states, both
Amorite and Hurrian. 7 In northern Mesopotamia, when the Dark Age finally came to
a close about 1500 B. C., we find that there was a powerful kingdom called Mitanni which controlled the north from the Mediterranean to the Zagros and this kingdom was ruled by
a dynasty of kings with characteristic Indo-Iranian names. Moreover, the royal gods were the well-known Vedic deities
Mithra, Indra, Varuna, and the Nasatyas, and the national sport was chariot-racing, with Indo-Iranian technical terms. There
was an aristocracy of chariot-warriors, called by the Vedic term
marya(nnt), literally, "youth, young warrior (s) ." 8 Extra
ordinary attention was paid to the horse, as we know from a Mitannian treatise on horse-training which was translated into Hittite about the 14th century B. C, and it must have fared
much better than the average peasant of the age. Sir Leonard Woolley's discoveries at Alalakh (Tell 'Atshanah) in northern
Syria since 1937 have yielded new historical data, carrying back the origin of the Mitannian state to before 1500 B. C. and
giving valuable new information about conditions in Syria a
century before the Amarna Age. Schaeffer's excavations at
Ugarit on the coast and du MesniTs work at Qatna (el-Mish
rifeh), near Hamath on the Orontes, have contributed very
extensive additional data of historical import, so that we now have an excellent idea of the state of culture and the ethnic
composition of Syria in the period following the Hyksos age. Excavations at such sites as Megiddo, Shechem, Tell Beit
Mirsim, Jericho, Tell el-'Ajjul, and Tell el-Fareah in Palestine
have clarified the sequence of cultural phases during the great
Dark Age to an extent that has not been remotely approached
elsewhere in the Near East, not even in Egypt. The Amarna tablets and several groups of cuneiform documents from Palestine and Syria, all dating between 1500 and 1300 B.C., have



154 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
given us a good idea of the distribution of linguistic stocks.
We can, therefore, compare the ethnic situation in Syria and
Palestine after the Hyksos age with what existed there in the
period between 2000 and 1750, which we now know from new
cuneiform and Egyptian sources. At that time there was not a
single clear non-Semitic name to be found south of Carchemish; all names were Canaanite or Amorite. Three centuries later this is changed. Canaanite and Amorite names still occur and
become commoner as we move southward, but both Syria and Palestine swarm with non-Semitic personal names distributed
among Hurrians, Indo-Iranians, and a third still unidentified
linguistic group. It follows from the foregoing facts that there must have been a great barbarian irruption from the northeast into the Fertile Crescent in the course of the 18th century B. C. This migration, probably a part of the general movement which carried the Indo-Iranians into India and Iran, must have been unusually terrifying, since swift horse-drawn chariots were used by the invaders in battle.9 The Cossaeans were forced from their mountains into Babylonia; the Hurrians were pushed con
siderably farther south in Mesopotamia and inundated Syria; a congeries of non-Semitic peoples of varied origin flooded Palestine. A. Hrdlicka has determined (1938) that the domi
nant racial type at Megiddo also shifted about this time from long-headed Mediterranean to broad-headed people of Alpine
affiliation.10 Since many, perhaps most of the invaders had
already been exposed to Syro-Mesopotamian culture, there was
no appreciable decline of material civilization. On the contrary,
the northern invaders built new towns and castles everywhere,
raising the density of population in Palestine considerably. There was a great improvement in the art of fortification. After a brief interlude in which earthworks largely replaced stone
walls, at least in some parts of tibe country,11 massive cyclopean
masonry with sloping glacis became the standard type of forti
fication. The patriarchal simplicity of social life in Amorite Palestine was replaced by a feudal system, in which there was increasing contrast between the houses of patricians and plebe
ians. At the same time the wealth of Syria and Palestine increased, owing in part to the fact that these lands had now



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 155
become internationalized in culture and served more and more
as manufacturing centres and as thoroughfares for trade. The
new wealth was concentrated almost entirely in the hands of
patricians, so that we find a great many rich tombs and houses,
together with a remarkable development of art, never really
surpassed and in some ways never equalled in any other preHellenistic age in Palestine.
The Egyptian conquest of Palestine and Syria began immediately after the expulsion of the Hyksos by Amosis I, about 1560 B. C. or a little later, with the siege of Sharuhen (Tell
el-Fare
ah?). His son, Amenophis I (1546-1525, according to
the new Borchardt-Edgerton chronology which we follow) presumably continued his father's conquests in Asia and the next
king, Tuthmosis I, invaded northern Syria. From about 1550 to about 1225 B. C. Palestine remained an Egyptian province
uninterruptedly except for brief rebellions, such as one at the
end of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut and others in the time
of Sethos I and Ramesses II. It is very important to emphasize
this fact, which has often been misunderstood in recent litera
ture. At first Egypt simply took over the Hyksos feudal organi
zation in Asia, which was very different from the contemporary
situation in Egypt itself, where all obvious traces of the Hyksos
regime had been eradicated. The local princes of Palestine and
Syria were permitted to govern their subjects as before, and were not molested as long as they paid their tribute properly and performed their part of the compulsory labor for the crown
(corvee). However, as time went on repeated uprisings brought reprisals and fortresses were built by the Egyptians in
various parts of the country in order to exercise a more effective
control. The Egyptian garrison at Beth-shan was first established about 1450 B. C., to judge from the most recent excava
tions there, but it was rebuilt again and again before the final decline of the Egyptian empire in Asia. Gaza and Joppa
remained for a long time provincial capitals, and they were
probably not the only ones. There was a curious double ad
ministration of government, which may have worked well under
strong pharaohs like Tuthmosis III and Harmais, but which
undoubtedly worked badly under a weak one like Akhenaten,
as we learn from the Amarna letters. This double system



156 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
consisted of the local feudal princes, each of whom was called
"
governor
"
(khazianu in Accadian) , on the one hand, and the
Egyptian commissioners, called "
inspectors
"
(rabisu in Acca
dian), on the other. The native governors were supported by
local forces of patrician chariotry and plebeian footmen
(khupsbu) , with which they were even permitted to wage in
ternecine warfare, provided it did not interfere with tribute or
reach dangerous dimensions. The Egyptian commissioners
raised tribute, saw to the execution of work on the roads and in the royal grain-lands of Jezreel or the forest-reserves of Leba
non; they were supported by contingents of Egyptian, Nubian, Bedouin, or Mediterranean slave-troops and mercenaries,
usually armed as bow-men. Since the Egyptian bureaucracy was
notoriously corrupt, as we know from innumerable documentary allusions, the troops often failed to receive their wages or
maintenance, whereupon they plundered the unlucky provin
cials. The native princes were allowed to correspond directly with the court, and to employ for this purpose cuneiform tablets written in Accadian, which had become the lingua franca of Western Asia (see below) . Excavations in many Late-Bronze sites of Palestine have
shown a progressive thinning out and impoverishment of the
population which suggest that Egyptian domination was very
oppressive. It is very significant in this connection that few new towns appear to have been founded in this age, to judge from
excavations; in Transjordan Glueck's recent explorations have shown that there was little or no advance in the frontier of
sedentary occupation until near the end of the Egyptian empire
in Asia, in the 13th century B. C. The increasing poverty of
tombs suggests that there was corresponding impoverishment of the upper classes, a deduction which is confirmed by the
growing inferiority of patrician houses, of fortifications, and
of art objects. To a certain extent this decline of Canaanite civilization may have been the result of inner weakness, but we
must not underestimate the effect of two or three centuries of
dishonest and rapacious administration by Egyptian bureaucrats.
The great edict of Harmais (Haremhab) repeatedly alludes to
the corruption and rapacity of Egyptian officials and soldiers about 1350 B. C.



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 157
The external history of Western Asia in this age centered
around the political relations of the central state, Mitanni, with
its neighbors. From the campaigns of Tuthmosis III (1490
1436 B. C.) in Syria to the time of Tuthmosis IV (1423-1413)
Egypt was almost continuously engaged in war with Mitanni.
At the end of this period the Hittites awoke from their sleep of two centuries and began to exert increasing pressure on Mitanni from the northwest. Naturally, therefore, the latter hastened
to make peace with Egypt and for three successive reigns
Mitannian princesses married pharaohs. About 1370 Suppiluliuma of Khatti conquered Mitanni, which he reduced to a
tributary state, though it continued to exist for another century
until its final subjugation by Shalmaneser I of Assyria (cir.
1280-1250 B. C). From 1370 to after 1225 B. C the Egyptian
and Hittite empires were neighbors in Syria, the boundary between them standing roughly at the Eleutherus Valley on
the coast and fluctuating in the interior. For the first fifty years (cir. 1370*1320 B. C.) each empire seems to have been too
much occupied by internal affairs to interfere seriously in the
affairs of its neighbor, and during much of this period the Hittites were kept busy by wars and rebellions in Asia Minor.
The energetic kings of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Sethos I (1319
1301) and Ramesses II (1301-1234), resumed hostilities, which
seem on the whole to have resulted unfavorably for Egypt,
though the Hittites were too much weakened by disorders in the north and west to take advantage of their victories. In the
year 1280 a formal peace was made by the two antagonists, who
seem to have kept it more or less faithfully until the final collapse of the Hittite Empire before the blows of barbarian invaders from the north, in the late 13th century B. C.
2. The Background of Religion and Thought, 1600-1200 B. C.
The late J. H. Breasted happily applied the term " the First
Internationalism " to the Late Bronze Age in the Near East.
Thanks to the archives of Amarna and Boghazkoy, supple
mented by recent finds in Syria, we see a sharp contrast between this age and the Middle Bronze, which has been so brightly illuminated by the archives of Mari. It is true that the princes



158 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
of Mesopotamia and Syria corresponded freely in the Middle
Bron2e, but they were all Accadians and Amorites, except for
a very few Hurrian and other rulers who lived in regions where cuneiform had long been known. In the 15th-13th centuries,
however, we find the Egyptians corresponding with Baby
lonians, Assyrians, Mitannians, Hittites, Arzawans (South
Anatolians) and Cypriotes, writing exclusively (it would appear) in Accadian but receiving letters in various languages.
Moreover, the Egyptian chancellery writes to its own Asiatic subjects in Accadian and expects to receive Accadian replies. So far does this custom go that about 1365 B. C. an Egyptian scribe writes ten letters from Tyre to the Egyptian court, all
composed in Accadian, though the mistakes of the scribe and his lavish use of Egyptian words and ideas prove his Egyptian
origin.
12 All the cuneiform letters written in Accadian from Egypt, Khatti, Mitanni, as well as from Canaanite and Hurrian subject states in Palestine and Syria, are written in types of Accadian which throughout betray the fact that their scribes
were using an unfamiliar tongue learned in school. Thus the
Egyptian scribes invariably reproduce Egyptian phonetic habits
and idioms, the Canaanite scribes always show that they are translating their ideas from Hebrew into Accadian, the Hittite and Hurrian scribes reflect Hittite and Hurrian linguistic prac
tice. The excavations at Amarna, Boghazkoy, and Ugarit have brought to light ample evidence of the existence of scribal schools, where non-Accadians learned the lingua franca with
the aid of vocabularies, unilingual, bilingual, and trilingual, of Accadian texts transcribed phonetically or otherwise, and of
exercise tablets. Of course, we may safely assume that most
of the instruction was given orally. It must also be remembered that the Accadian used in international correspondence and
even in literary composition was not contemporary Babylonian,
though it was influenced by it, but was a corrupt form of the
standard Accadian language used throughout Mesopotamia in
the 18th century B. C., as we know from the Mari archives. Moreover, there is such uniformity in the errors of the various national groups of scribes that there were evidently national schools which perpetuated
" dialects " of Accadian that remind one of national forms of Low Latin in the Dark Ages of Europe.



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD . . . 159
In view of this situation and the extraordinary amount of
reciprocal influence exerted by Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Syria
in the Late Bronze Age on material civilization, it would indeed be extraordinary if there were not a considerable amount of exchange of higher culture. As a matter of fact we find that
this was indeed the case. A few examples from the wealth of
available material must suffice. Many literary works were
translated from Accadian into Hurrian and Hittite, as well as from Hurrian into Hittite. About the 15th century B. C. we find a Hurrian hymn to the Babylonian goddess Nikkal translated
into North Canaanite at Ugarit.13 The Hittite treaty of 1280 B. C. was translated from Accadian into Egyptian. The Egyp
tian scribe at Tyre, of whom we have spoken, translated two
Egyptian poems into Accadian. In the 13th century we find that
the Canaanite myth of Astarte and the Sea, known from an
Ugaritic fragment, had been put into Egyptian.14 At Amarna
were found a number of Accadian mythological texts, such as Nergal and Ereshkigal, Adapa and the South Wind, transcribed
into special phonetic form for Egyptian students; we also find
that the Hittite recension of the Accadian epic of the " King of
Battle," dealing with the exploits of Sargon of Accad in Asia
Minor, existed at Amarna in more than one copy, to judge
from the number of fragments which have been found. Accadian astrological and divinatory texts have been discovered at Boghazkoy in Asia Minor, at Alalakh and elsewhere in Syria, and were doubtless in great demand, to judge from Hittite and
Hurrian translations of them. Egyptian and Babylonian scholars
and professional men were prized in other lands, as we know from numerous allusions. About 1300 B. C., for instance, the
Egyptian physician and architect (combining both professions,
like Imuthes!) Pareamakhu, who seems to be the son of an
Egyptian architect buried at Beth-shan in Palestine, was in
demand in at least two Anatolian courts.15 A little later a
Babylonian physician named Raba-sha-Marduk sojourned at the Hittite court. The impact of this cultural internationalism on the religion
of Western Asia was prodigious. The names and ideograms of Sumero-Accadian gods and goddesses were borrowed by Hur
rians, Hittites, Amorites, and Canaanites alike. A good half of



160 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
the known figures of the Hurrian pantheon in the second
millennium B. C. is of Sumerian or Accadian origin. The princi
pal deities of places like Aleppo, Qatna, and Kadesh on the
Orontes bore Mesopotamian names or names written with
cuneiform ideograms. The cult of Mesopotamian deities like
Dagan penetrated into southern Palestine. Local Canaanite
gods of Palestine were identified with such characteristically
Mesopotamian figures as the war-god Ninurta. The cult of
Ishtar of Nineveh was carried by Hurrians and Hittites into places as far removed from Assyria as Egypt and southwestern
Asia Minor.16 In slightly earlier (pre-Cossaean) cuneiform lists
of gods we find the Hurrian Teshub (Teshup) and Shaushka
and the Canaanite Addu (Hadad) and Ashtartu identified with
Adad and Ishtar, respectively. Similarly the Canaanites of the
Amarna letters identified the Egyptian Ree with their own sun
god, Shamash, while the Egyptians equated Canaanite Baal with
their own Seth, Ba'alat Gubla (" the Lady of Byblus ") with
Hathor. The Egyptians of the New Empire adopted the Canaanite goddesses Astarte and Anath, as well as the gods
Hauron and Rashap, etc., into their pantheon. In view of the dose parallelism in development, as well as of the interchange and cross-fertilization of cultural elements
which we have been describing, it will be better to treat the
outstanding phases of Late-Bronze religion, in so far as they are of special interest to us in the present study, thematically
rather than geographically. We shall accordingly treat the following subjects: tendencies toward monotheism; the growth
of individual responsibility and emphasis on personality. We
shall then sketch the religion of the Canaanites, as we know
it today. In the third millennium Mesopotamians and Egyptians had
naively regarded their cosmic deities as universal, as we know
from many passages in early religious literature. The sun-god
of Egypt or Babylonia was the only sun, so far as both learned
cosmology and instinctive reaction were concerned. Of course, there may already have been conscious identifications of SumeroAccadian with Anatolian or Egyptian gods, but evidence is lack
ing. In the age of Hammurabi the homogeneity of culture in
Mesopotamia, Syria, and eastern Asia Minor was so great that



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 161
identification of deities began to become popular, as we have
just seen. However, this was in itself no more decisive a tendency toward monotheism than was the corresponding pro
cess in Graeco-Roman times. The fact that there were many
cultic forms of a national deity led to a certain movement in the direction of theological universalism. In Asia Minor and
northwestern Mesopotamia we find that such divinities as
Teshub and Ghepat were worshipped in many different places,
after which the deities are named to distinguish them. This
was equally true of Ishtar and Adad in Mesopotamia, and of
Baal and Anath in Canaan. As a result of this phenomenon we
find in Canaanite an increasing tendency to employ the plural
'Asktarot, " Astartes," and *Anatot, " Anaths," in the clear sense
of "
totality of manifestations of a deity/
7 This is further illustrated by the frequent honorific greeting of Pharaoh in the
Amarna letters as " my gods, my sun-god," which means, of
course, that Pharaoh was extravagantly addressed as being the
writer's whole pantheon. If the Canaanites were accustomed
to use so grandiloquent an expression in addressing their Egyp
tian suzerain, referring (as we know from many passages) to
the fact that he claimed to be the living incarnation of the
sun-god, we may be confident that they had borrowed it from
cultic phraseology, where they magnified one of their own gods
in monolatrous fashion by addressing him as the totality of
gods, i. e., as equivalent to the entire pantheon. That this
explanation is correct we know also from the fact that the
Israelites took over the Canaanite plural, elohim,
"
gods/' in
the sense of " God." Belief in the universal dominion of a high god was the natural result of the slightest reflection about his cosmic func
tions, and was facilitated by the general identification of gods
with similar functions. This belief is explicitly attested by many passages in the religious literature of our period, a number of
which may be quoted. The most striking passages naturally
come from Egypt, where our sources are much more extensive.
Since the Aten heresy was a special development, which we shall
describe briefly below, we shall restrict ourselves here to the
great Egyptian Amun hymn of the 15th century (though most of the contexts are considerably older) :



162 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
" Thou far-traveller, thou prince of Upper Egypt, lord of the land of the Matoi (Eastern Desert of Nubia) and ruler of Punt (East Africa) , Thou greatest of heaven, thou oldest of the earth, lord of what exists . . . Legitimate lord, father of the gods, who created man and made the animals . . . Who made the upper ones and the lower ones, who illumines the two lands . . . Whose sweet odor the gods love, as he comes from Punt, rich in fragrance as he comes from the land of the Matoi, with fair countenance
as he comes from "God's Land "
(Asia) . . . Praise to thee who didst create the gods, who didst raise heaven and
stretch out the earth! "
" Thou art the only one, who created what there is ; the unique one,
who created what exists thou from whose eyes came men and from
whose mouth sprang the gods . . .
* Praise to thee!' (says) every wild animal, 'Hail to thee!' (says) every foreign land, as high as heaven and as wide as earth is and as
deep as the sea is . . .
Thou father of the fathers of all the gods, thou who didst raise heaven and stretch out earth, thou who didst make what is and create what exists . . . Dweller on the horizon, Horus of the east ! The foreign land brings
silver and gold to him and true lapis lazuli (which came from Iran by way of Syria) because of its love for him. Myrrh and incense (come) mixed out of the land of the Matoi . . .
" 17
Owing to the paucity o Mesopotamian religious texts of
comparable type which can be dated with certainty to the period
under discussion, we shall quote only from a prayer of Tukulti
Ninurta I of Assyria (cir. 1250-1215). The attribution of this
prayer to the first king of the name has now been made certain
by die discovery at Nineveh of extensive portions o a triumphal
poem of this king, referring to the same situation and using almost identical language in places.
18 The Assyrian king is
represented as praying to Assur for help against the Cossaean
king of Babylonia, Kashtiliash III, with whom he is at war.
Assur is repeatedly called " lord o lands " and "
king of all the gods." His foes are described as rebels against his authority,
as tc
trusting in their own might and despising the name of
God." One passage is particularly instructive.



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 163
" O lord, Assur, be gracious to thy land!
O Assur, great lord, king of the earth-gods, the land (mada***
Mesopotamia) , O Assur, is thine!
Assyrian Enlil, lord of the lands (km = foreign land) , the land,
O Assur, is thine! " 19
An Accadian cuneiform text found at Nineveh and only
recently published, describes the power of the Babylonian god
Marduk in the following terms:
" I am the great lord, Marduk; 1 watch everything and traverse the mountains (beyond Meso
potamia) . . .
The one who traverses the lands, all of them, from sunrise to sunset,
ami."
Marduk is then represented as saying that he went to the land
of the Hittites and set up his throne there for twenty-four
years, during which he advanced Babylonian interests in
various ways.20
A very interesting passage from Canaanite literature has
recently (1938) been published by Virolleaud.21 In the mytho
logical epic of Baal and Anath, which dates in its present form
from about 1400 B. C. and probably reflects an earlier stage of
mythopoeia, it is said of Koshar, who was identified with the
Egyptian god Ptah of Memphis: " His is Caphtor, the throne
on which he sits, and Egypt, the land of his inheritance." The
word Kptr9 biblical Kaphtor and Accadian Kaptara, certainly
refers to Crete, and the term used for Egypt is the native name
of Memphis, used in the same way in the Amarna tablets and
later adopted by the Greeks as the designation of the Nile
Valley.22 Phoenician gods are not infrequently said to be enthroned on an island in the sea; cf. Ezekiel's words about
the prince of Tyre (Ezek. 28: 2),
" I am a god; I sit on the throne of god in the midst of the seas." El appears in Ugaritic
literature as dwelling
" in the midst of the fountains of the two

1 from which " he causes the rivers to flow." To reach
him it was necessary to journey through
" a thousand plains,
ten thousand fields." 2S The ancient Canaanites can scarcely have
had any more difficulty in assuming the universality of a cosmic
deity than the Homeric Greeks had. With the Greeks of the



164 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Mycenaean age, whose conceptions are reflected in the Iliad, the
sun-god is happiest when sojourning with the Aethiopians, Zeus
is as much at home with the Trojans or Amazons as he is with
the Greeks. No matter how far Odysseus wanders, he never
gets beyond the jurisdiction of his enemy, Poseidon, or of his patroness, Athene. Another illustration of ideas in this general
age may be drawn from the Report of Wen-amun, early in the
llth century B. C. Wen-amun is sent to Byblus to obtain
cedars for the bark of Amun at Thebes. On the way he is
robbed by the men of Dor, so he is handicapped in his negotia
tions, since Egyptian suzerainty over Phoenicia had long previ
ously expired. Nevertheless, Wen-amun says to the Canaanite
prince of Byblus,
" There is no ship on the waters that does not belong to Amun, for his is the sea and his is Lebanon, of which
thou sayest,
'
It is mine! ' " The Canaanite is then represented
as admitting that Amun is supreme and as observing that he
taught and equipped Egypt first, so that Egypt .was able to instruct the Canaanites in the arts of civilization.
From the recognition that many different deities are simply
manifestations of a single god and that the domain of a high
god is universal, it was but a step, in a highly sophisticated and
empirically logical age, to some form of practical monotheism. This stage is documented twice in Babylonian literature, and the composition of both texts may be referred with much
confidence to the Cossaean period. The first has been known for more than forty years; its Cossaean date is established by the fact that the Cossaean god Shuqamuna and Tishpak, the
chief god of Eshnunna, appear in it. In this tablet Marduk of Babylon is successively identified with a whole list of male
deities: Enlil is a form of Marduk with reference to ruling and
decision, Sin is Marduk as illuminer of the night, Shamash is
Marduk as god of justice, etc. Since no goddess is mentioned,
it is possible that the Babylonian theologian drew the line at amalgamating the sexes and limited his monotheistic evolution
to a form of ditheism. The tendency, however, is unmistakable. The second document is of a somewhat different nature. It was
first published by Ebeling over twenty years ago, but has escaped
general attention.24 Though the copy which we possess comes from Assur, the intrinsic evidence makes it Babylonian and



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD . . . 165
dates it probably to the late second millennium B. C, when the cult of the war-god Ninurta became most popular. Here all the
important deities are listed successively as parts o the body o
Ninurta: e. g., his face is heaven; Enlil and Ninlil are his two
eyes; the protecting goddesses of his two eyes are Gula and Belili (Belit-ilani) ; his chin is Ishtar of the Stars; his lips are
Anu and Antum; his tongue is Pabilsag; his gums are the vault
of heaven and earth; his ears are Ea and Damkina; his skull is Adad; his forehead is Shala; his neck is Marduk; his throat
is Sarpanitum; his breast is Nabu and so on down to the lower extremities. In other words, Ninurta spans the whole
cosmos and all the gods and goddesses may be symbolically
equated with parts of his cosmic body. There can be little doubt
that this remarkable conception goes back to dynamistic sacri
ficial ritual, where the virtue and the symbolic meaning of the
animal to be sacrificed are extolled in hyperbolic terms. For
instance, the black bull which was sacrificed in the ritual of the
temple-musician (kalu) was symbolically designated as the great cosmic bull of heaven, companion of the god Ningizzida
and decider of fate. The dynamistic conceptions involved are closely related to an Indie parallel in the ritual of the horse
sacrifice (asvamedha) , where the horse is symbolically identi
fied with the cosmos and parts of his body are treated as cosmic
entities. 25 The idea of the cosmic body of Ninurta, taking root
in dynamistic and corporative ideas, was definitely on the way
to a pantheism of Brahmanic type. At the same time, there can
be no doubt that this incorporation of all the gods and goddesses in one all-embracing deity is monotheistic to the extent that it eliminates all but the one god from ultimate theological reality.
All of the monotheistic tendencies so far described remained partial or ineffective. It was reserved for an unknown Egyptian
to take a long step toward true monotheism not later than about 1400 B. C. This step consisted in divorcing the figure of
the supreme, universal sun-god, , Amun-Re', from its mythological trappings, and in adoring the solar disk itself as the only
god. It has often been maintained that this advance is due to
the heretic-king, Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) himself, but the first
traces of the new teaching date from the reign of his father
Amenophis III (1413-1377 B. C.), where they even appear in 12



166 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
a beautiful hymn to the sun-god found in the tomb of two
brothers, Suti and Hor. 26 In the second strophe of this hymn the sun is addressed by the appellation Aten,
" solar disk/' in words from which we may quote the following:
" O creator of what the earth brings forth, Khnum and Amun of
mankind! .... Excellent mother of gods and man, good creator who takes the greatest pains with his innumerable creatures. . . .
He who reaches the ends of the lands every day and beholds those
who walk there . . .
Every land adores him at his rising every day, in order to praise Him."
Here the Aten is described as both father and mother of creation, as the lord of all lands and men, as identical with the
creator-god Khnum of Elephantine. But in other strophes of
this same hymn we find Amun-Ree
appearing with the usual
mythological trappings, so it is evident that the Aten cult had
only obtained a precarious footing in certain quarters. As has
been pointed out by Sethe, Breasted, and others, the Aten
theology must have developed either in Heliopolitan circles or
among priests familiar with the solar theology taught in them.27
In 1377 Amenophis IV, the future heretic-king, became
pharaoh, though a weak, sickly lad of about eleven. His
mummy was found in the tomb of his mother, Queen Teye, in
1907, and was examined by the famous anatomist and authority
on Egyptian mummification, Elliot Smith. According to the
latter's examination he was definitely pathological, with an
abnormal pelvis and a peculiarly shaped skull; he was between
25 and 28 when he died. These facts agree with the evidence
of art, which exhibits him with distended skull, protruding
abdomen, and almost feminine build. The doubt first cast on the identification of the mummy has been largely removed by
the discovery that the mummy of his nephew (?) Tut-ankh
amun exhibits almost identical physical characteristics, especially
with respect to shape of the head. 28 The fact that he was not
over 28 when he died and that he reigned 17 years would make him not over eleven at his accession. His eldest daughter,
Merit-aten,29 cannot have been over twelve when she was mar
ried and she apparently bore no children; her youngest sister
was married to Tut-ankh-amun, who cannot have been over



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 167
thirteen when he became king. In view of these circumstances of age and physical health it is quite absurd to consider Akhe
naten as the founder of the Aten cult, or even as the " first
individual in history" (Breasted). He must, accordingly, have been the tool of others, either through his mother, Teye (who
was still alive in the eleventh year of his reign) , or his wife,
Nefretete (who was probably older than he), or some unidenti
fied favorite. Hence it- was only the flattery of his courtiers
which pictured him as the promulgator of a new "
teaching." so
Thanks to the ample documentation secured by successive
excavators of the new capital, Akhetaten, built for himself by
the young pharaoh when he was about 17, it is certain that the cult of die Aten did not attain its definitive form until after
some eight years or more of vacillation. In its full, though
brief, development it appears as a true solar monotheism, with
the solar formula, " who rejoices on the horizon in his quality (literally 'name') as light which is in the solar disk/' Ad
herents of the cult of the Aten were commanded to erase the name of Amun wherever it occurred; the names of all other
deities were sporadically obliterated (especially at Karnak),
showing clearly that the more fanatical monotheists regarded the solar disk as the only god. In the famous Hymn to the
Aten, which has been reproduced so often that it is familiar to
all," we find that the Aten is explicitly addressed as " the only
god, beside whom there is no other," as maker and sustainer of Syria and Nubia as well as of Egypt, as creator of everything,
lord of the universe, including the most distant lands. The Osirian mortuary ritual was modified with the disappearance
of Osiris and his retinue. The sarcophagus of princess MeketRe* substitutes the figure of the queen her mother for the four
protecting figures of Isis and Nephthys. In the official documents there is hardly a trace of the old mythology, except where
it was consistent with the new ideas: i. e.,.the sun-god is still
self-created, though we may safely conjecture that the Aten
worshippers abandoned the crude conceptions which more
primitive times had associated with such creation.
While the Aten cult was, accordingly, a true monotheism, it was not suited to become the national religion of Egypt. In the
first place, its atmosphere was much too ratified for the masses,



168 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
and even for the upper classes. The extraordinary emphasis
laid on "
truth," which led the young king and his advisers to substitute more lifelike representation for the standardized
canons of proportion and the living language of the country for an extinct literary tongue, was good in itself, but it ended
in materialistic hedonism. Moreover, the courtiers simply imi
tated the new fashions; now, for example, all royal retainers
were represented with the abnormal head and limbs of the king! Only cheerful and pleasant things could be described in
hymns or portrayed in art. The beautiful family life of the
king, with his young queen and three little daughters, absorbed the whole attention of artists, and the duties of pharaoh as king and commander, as magistrate and administrator were
disregarded. How little sexual ethics were reformed appears
from the king's marriage to his own third daughter.81 In
another respect the new religion was materialistic in its ten
dencies. The king remained the incarnation of the sun-god on
earth and was flattered and extolled by his courtiers (many of
whom were upstarts, as we learn from their own inscriptions) to a slavish and otherwise unparalleled extent. In order, appar
ently, to develop a consistent theological system, moreover, the Aten was not infrequently represented as a hierarchic triad
formed of the Aten proper, of " the living Aten in the temple
of the Aten at Akhetaten," and of the king himself, who is said
to be " the eternal son who has come out of the sun/' and to be
" born anew every morning, like the sun-god his father." The middle phase of the triad presumably linked the sun-god in heaven with his earthly incarnation by a hypostasis established
permanently in the new temple. The new Aten theology had
developed far from primitive dynamism or corporatism in the
direction of empirical cultic theology. A third weakness of the Aten cult was that it nowhere seems to lay any stress on social
justice or the well-being of the masses; the royal family and the courtiers were apparently quite without interest in the
improvement of their subjects' lot, which must have been ex
tremely hard, to judge from contemporary and slightly later documents. It is certain, at all events, that the Theban reaction came with a hatred and violence unparalleled in native Egyptian
history, and the names of the heretic-king and his immediate



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD . . . 169
successors were anathematized by priests and scribes down to
the latest times. However, the Aten " doctrine " was well
rooted in Heliopolitan theology and it had apparently been
well diffused before the reign of Akhenaten, so it could hardly
disappear overnight. We may confidently suppose that it con
tinued to be taught for generations in Lower Egypt, long jealous
of the ascendancy of Thebes. It is clear from our documentary sources that the priests of Thebes used their victory to enhance
their own power, and the inevitable resentment felt in Lower
Egypt may have been partly responsible for the return to
Hyksos traditions and to the cult of the long despised god Seth,
the enemy of Horus, which triumphed about 1320 B. C, with
the accession of Harnesses I.32
The strength of this reaction was never clearly felt by scholars until P. Montet's excavations at Tanis in the northeastern Delta since 1930. Now it has become obvious, thanks to the wealth of new inscriptional data from Tanis, the old
home of Seth. The Ramesside house actually traced its ancestry
back to a Hyksos king whose era was fixed 400 years before the
date commemorated in the "
400-year Stela " of Tanis. The
great-grandfather of Ramesses II evidently came from an old
Tanite family, very possibly of Hyksos origin, since his name
was Sethos (Suta) . This Suta appears as a chief of archers who
is mentioned several times in the Amarna tablets.33 Ramesses
II established his capital and residency at Tanis, which he
named " House of Ramesses " and where he built a great temple
of the old Tanite, later Hyksos god Seth (pronounced at that time Sutekh}** Ramesses II also encouraged the cult of many
other gods of the Delta, both Egyptian and Canaanite; he
particularly worshipped Baal, who had already been identified
with Seth by the Hyksos, and his sister and consort Anath, who
received a special temple. Seth and Baal were recognized as
the same divinity, who was the son of the goddess of heaven (Nut), lord of heaven and storm-god, for whose special use
the thunder weapon was created. Even in iconography the Ramesside representations of Seth-Baal are practically indis
tinguishable, except in artistic technique, from those of the
Canaanite Baal which have been found in considerable numbers during recent excavations in Palestine and Syria. In a similar



170 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
way Anath was identified with Nephthys, the consort of Seth,
and Astarte became Isis or Hathor, while the "
great shepherd," Horon, was identified with Horus. 35 This thorough-going cultic amalgamation of Canaanite and Egyptian deities in the 13th
century B. G, while hardly monotheistic, was undoubtedly the
culmination of a long-existing process of internationalizing high gods. Moreover, it was an even longer step in the direction of
monotheism when in such public documents as the treaty between Ramesses II and King Khattusilis of the Hittites the
chief male deities of Syria and Asia Minor are all called " Seth "
(Sutekh) . We are, accordingly, quite justified in insisting that
the universalistic tendencies of the " First International Age " reached their climax in the thirteenth century B.C., where Egyptian gods are freely identified with the leading deities of
Western Asia, and where the patron deity of the Egyptian king is also the chief god of Canaanites, Hittites, and Mesopotamians.
The development of personal religion and ethics, already evident both in Egypt and in Mesopotamia during the early
second millennium, as we have seen, attained new heights in both countries during the Late Bronze Age. Thanks to such
material as the 125th chapter of the Book of the Dead, we are
in an unusually favorable position to analyze and appraise the
situation in Egypt at this time. In the New Empire the Book
of the Dead takes the place of the Coffin Texts of the Middle
Empire, which in their turn had replaced the Pyramid Texts.
As will be recalled, the Coffin Texts contained much material from the Pyramid Texts, to which still more new material was
added. The Book of the Dead includes many spells and selections from the Coffin Texts and a little of ultimately Pyramid
origin. While there was no true " Book of the Dead " in the
New Empire, the mortuary papyri of that age are generally parallel in arrangement and repeat so many of the then recognized stock of texts that it has been possible to establish a
formal system of numbering
"
chapters." One of the longest
of these chapters is the 125th, containing the so-called "
Nega
tive Confession" which was supposed to be made by the deceased at the court of Osiris before being admitted to life in the other world. Thanks to the studies of Breasted, E. Drioton,
J. Spiegel, and others in the past few years, we now have a



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 171
much clearer idea of the origin and nature of the "
Negative
Confession." 36 As Drioton first pointed out (1922), the docu
ment is composite, containing elements which go back in
substantially their present form into the early Middle Empire
and others which can hardly antedate the end of the same age.
The oldest manuscripts containing this chapter belong to about
the 15th century B. C. The composite origin of the document and the addition of variants from different recensions explain
its repetitious character, which was not improved by a tendency
to make the number of individual declarations equal that of the
42 judges (one for each nome) . In the standard form of the chapter there are three parts: first, a declaration that the deceased has not committed any one of a long list of sins; second, another longer declaration to the same effect, usually in 42
sections; third, a short positive declaration, listing some of the good deeds of the deceased while on earth.
A careful analysis of the two negative declarations shows
clearly that the first is older than the second, as might be
inferred a priori from the more artificial form of the latter.
In the first, sins against the gods are particularly emphasized, though they are still fewer than the sins against men. In the second one sins against the king and the local god are men
tioned, and the catalogue of sins against men is considerably more detailed. Moreover, in the second there is a series of
faults of character, such as lying, greed, eavesdropping, sudden
anger, refusal to hear the truth, unseemly haste in acting,
garrulousness, vanity, arrogance, prodigality, etc., none of which
occurs in the first. The two lists include, between them, prac
tically every important type of transgression against religious obligations and the rights of others. Attention has been called to the absence of any reference to honoring parents or authori
ties, but this is probably to be explained by the ultimately royal origin of the nucleus of the confession. Since the king
was superior to all mankind, there could be no question of
honoring any one beneath him in dignity; his duties to relatives
and authorities were already covered by other declarations.
Social justice was amply recognized by the inclusion of many references to just weights and balances, true surveying of
fields, just use of water for irrigation, refraining from attempts



172 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
to corrupt magistrates and from any oppression, as well as by both negative and positive assurances with respect to feeding the hungry, giving water to the thirsty, clothing the naked,
and providing transport (across the Nile) for the one who had
none. Compared with the Ten Commandments, the Negative
Confession is unwieldy, repetitious, badly integrated, and lack
ing in any sense of balance between important and unimportant things. Yet there is not a single intelligible declaration which
could not be conscientiously repeated by a member of the
Society for Ethical Culture today aside, of course, from some
having exclusively to do with religious observances, and even
these could hardly be rejected in principle, since breaking one
of them would seriously offend a member of the religious group
in question. When we recall that every Egyptian was supposed to submit to trial before Osiris and to strive for justification if he wished to enjoy a happy life in Elysium, the moral force of
the Negative Confession becomes evident. On grave stelae of
the New Empire there are many illustrations of individual efforts to realize these ideals or of claims to have fulfilled them.
To be sure, in practice the ethical ideals of the ancient Egyptians
hardly affected the life of the average man, who was either too ignorant or too eager for pleasure and gain to listen to admoni
tion. Moreover, the ubiquitous sway of magic made both classes and masses sure of getting into Elysium, in view of the vast number and the reputed efficacy of the charms and spells which
make up the bulk of the Book of the Dead. Many charms
made extravagant claims which priests and magicians were not
slow to exploit to their own advantage. In general we know
that the Egyptians of the New Empire were excessively venal and corrupt, and that the efforts of a Tuthmosis III to raise standards of administrative honesty were transient in their results.
To the latter part of the New Empire belongs a remarkable
series of devout sayings and prayers, most of which are pre
served in graffiti and funeral stelae from the Thebaid, dating
from 1300-1100 B. C. While some of the material which they
contain may be shown to be older, much of it must be later than the Aten revolution. Thanks to the studies of Erman and
Breasted, there can be no doubt that Egyptian religion here



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 173
touches the highest point ever reached by any pre-Israelite faith
with which we are acquainted. 37 In these intensely human
documents we find a touching depth of simple piety. Take, for
example, the prayer of Neb-ree
, a painter in the Theban ne
cropolis under Ramesses II (1301-1234 B. C) :
" Praise to Amun! I make hymns to his name!
I praise him to the height of heaven and the breadth of earth;
I tell of his might to him who saileth upstream and downstream.
Thou, O Amun, art the lord of the quiet (pious),
Who cometh at the cry of the poor.
When I cried to thee in my affliction thou didst come to save me,
In order to give breath to the feeble, to save me from bondage.
Thou, O Amun-Ree of Thebes, art he who saveth him who is in the underworld . . . When men cry unto thee, thou art he who cometh from afar."
From the mass of material collected by Erman, we may quote
one other example, in a prayer to Thoth written down in the
late 13th century B. C., but composed somewhat earlier:
" Thoth, thou sweet fountain for one who thirsteth in the desert! It is sealed for one who talketh, but it open for one who is quiet
(pious) !
When the quiet one cometh, he findeth the fountain."
Turning to Mesopotamia we have our most important data
on conceptions of personal ethics and individual responsibility in the incantatory series Shurpu, especially in the second and third tablets of the nine of which it was composed. Just as in
Egypt we find a new sense of individual responsibility arising
after the eighteenth century B. C. The Shurpu series is devoted
to incantatory rituals by which a sick or bewitched man was supposed to be cured or freed from his state. Internal evidence
points strongly to the Cossaean period (between 1500 and 1150 B. C) as the date of its composition, as may be shown from
the divine names which it contains, from its language and style
(A. Sdhott, 1928 ),
88 and from other considerations (W. von
Soden, 193 5 ).
39 The first thing incumbent on the priest was to discover what the patient had done that was punishable by
superior powers. Since this investigation was generally rather hopeless, all possible sins, violations of tabus, and acts which



174 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
might have brought revenge from gods, men, or demons were
scrupulously listed and the patient was freed from the effect of
any one of them by the incantatory ritual which followed.
It is obvious that this "
shot-gun
" method depended partly
for its efficacy upon the completeness of the list of sins and
tabus. We have no means of knowing how much stress, if any, was laid on the actual identification of a transgression on which the illness or other trouble of the patient might be blamed. In spite of the magical associations of the Shurpu list,
it represents just as individual a relation between sin and punishment as the Egyptian Negative Confession. In the sins and
faults listed we can easily detect a much stronger sense of social
solidarity and patriarchal organization than in Egypt. No sins are stressed more often here than the breaking up of families and clans or the separation of father from son, of brother from brother, etc. Failure to honor parents, disinheritance of a legiti
mate heir, (trespassing) entrance into a neighbor's house,
approach to a neighbor's wife, murder or robbery of a neighbor, and similar sins are listed in great detail. Transgressions against
the gods are also emphasized. However, along with social and religious offenses are also listed, without any special order, acts of unkindness which might bring reprisals (e. g., to refuse the loan of irrigation water for a single day, to refuse the loan
of a water jar, damming up a neighbor's irrigation ditch) and acts which were merely unpropitious, such as swearing by the sun-god at his rising, swearing an oath (by a god) with
unwashed hands, sitting in a seat facing the sun. Other acts,
again, belong to the domain of empirically discovered hygienic tabus: e. g. 9 urinating or vomiting into a stream, drinking from a water tap, etc. In short, Shurpu carries us into a different
socio-cultural environment from what we find in contemporary
Egypt. In Mesopotamia at this time the organization of society
was more primitive than in Egypt, in part clearly as the result of reversion after a long period of feudal rule by the Cossaean
barbarians, since the Code of Hammurabi and contemporary
Old Babylonian literature reflect a definitely more complex state
of society. At the same time magic played a greater role in daily life, whereas in Egypt it was at that time relegated in large part to preparation for the future life, a field which was



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 175
virtually barred to it in Babylonia. The character of the indi
vidual was still of minor importance as compared to the stability
of the group to which he belonged yet the individual was now definitely accountable for his acts and he could not hope for a
healthy or happy life in this world unless he lived drcumspectly.
We can no longer adequately survey the religious background
of early Israel without a brief sketch of the religion of the
Canaanites of Phoenicia and Palestine as we now know it from
the alphabetic texts of Ugarit, supplemented by sporadic archae
ological finds. We have already described the discovery and decipherment of these invaluable documents (above, p. 12) and
warned against uncritical use of the translations of any scholar.
Happily there are now so many passages whose meaning is clear
that we can give an adequate account without using question
able material. The mythological texts and rituals from Ugarit, the myths recorded by Philo Byblius on the authority of a
Phoenician named Sanchuniathon (who seems to have flourished about the seventh century B. C), and the scattered evi
dence from other sources agree so completely in all main aspects
that there can no longer be any doubt that the Canaanites
possessed just as sharply defined a religious and mythological system as did the Egyptians and the Sumero-Accadians, though
it was much cruder as well as more debased. From the names of Early-Bronze towns in Palestine and Phoenicia we know that the Canaanites of the third millennium had the same gods as
appear at Ugarit and elsewhere later. It is highly probable that
the contents of the mythological poems of Ugarit are very early, going back into the third millennium in substantially their
present form.
The head of the Canaanite (Phoenician) pantheon was the god El (i. e., the god), just as among the Hebrews, where he
was early called El *Elyon,
" the Highest God," or El Shaddai
(see below) . El's consort was the goddess Ashirat, the Asherah
of the Bible, often called " Ashirat of the Sea," meaning ori
ginally perhaps
" She who Treads the Sea." This goddess was
also worshipped by South Arabians and Amorites; a votive
inscription in Sumerian which was erected to her by an Amorite
of the 18th century B. C. calls her " the bride of heaven." El
is usually described in the poems of Ugarit as residing in a



176 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
distant cosmic spot known as the " Source of the Two Deeps "
(" deep
" = tehom, as in Hebrew), from which " he causes the
rivers to flow/' He plays a rather passive role as " the father of
years," receiving suppliants and sending his instructions by his
messengers. In this respect he resembles Egyptian Re* and Accadian Anu. In one myth he is represented with realistic
imagery as seducing two unnamed women, who duly give birth to the two "beautiful and gracious gods," Shahar (Dawn) and Shalim (the Perfect One). Philo reports also that El
(Kronos) killed his son Sadidos and cut his daughter's head off,
" so that all the gods were struck with fear of the caprice of Kronos."
The great active figure of the pantheon was Baal or Haddu
(Hadad), the storm-god and king of the gods (as he is called
both at Ugarit and by Philo) . His common later title among
the Phoenicians was " lord of heaven "
(Ba'al shamern) , which has not yet been found at Ugarit, but which was already applied
to the Syrian storm-god in the 14th century B. C. 40 Baal was the son of Dagon, whose relationship to El is not clear in the
Ugaritic texts, but who was one of three brothers of El accord
ing to Philo. Baal's standing appellation in the epic literature of Ugarit is Al'iyan, which seems to be a contraction of the
formula " I prevail (*al'iyu) over the champions who encounter
me in the land of battle," since this is explicitly given as his
name in a text published in 1938 by Virolleaud.41 As Al'iyan,
Baal is the hero of a great mythological epic, extensive portions of which have been recovered from the ruins of 14th-century
Ugarit. Here the central theme is the glorification of Baal, for
whom a great temple is built and who is slain by monsters and
carried to the land of Death (Mot) . Mot is the son of El and
Ashirat (Shea) according to both the early epic and Philo, who
correctly renders his name as " Death/* After Baal's death all
life on earth languishes, so his sister,
" the virgin
" Anath, finds Mot, kills him in a terrible battle, after which she performs an
interesting dynamistic ritual with his body:
11 She seized Mot, son of El;
With the sword she cut him up, with the sieve she winnowed



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 177
In the fire she burned him, in the mill she ground him,
In the field she sowed him,
In order that the birds might eat their portion, in order that they
might destroy the seed (?) . . .
" 42
In no ancient mythology do we find such explicit identification
of the body of a god with the grain, which is successively reaped
and threshed, winnowed, baked as bread, and ground to meal
(these operations are transposed for greater consistency of
action) , and finally sowed as grain in the field. The purpose of
this ritual was not to revive Mot but to revive Baal by sympa
thetic action. Considering the extraordinary fluidity and varia
tion of these ideas, however, it is quite possible that Mot could
also be treated as a form of Adonis.
Goddesses of fertility play a much greater role among the
Canaanites than they do among any other ancient people. The
two dominant figures are Astarte and Anath, who are called in
an Egyptian text of the New Empire
" the great goddesses who
conceive but do not bear," i. e., who are always virginal but who are none the less fruitful. This somewhat sophisticated appella
tion was presumably an attempt to rationalize fluid Canaanite
conceptions of goddesses of fertility, who were sometimes treated as virgins and sometimes as mothers and creatresses of
all life. Thus Anath appears in almost the same breath as
"
virgin
" and as "
progenitress of the peoples/* 4S Philo Byblius also emphasizes the virginity of Astarte and of Anath' s sister, otherwise unknown. These Canaanite goddesses were
nearly always represented in iconography as naked, as we know
both from the many hundreds of " Astarte "
plaques from the period 1700-1100 B. C. which have been discovered by excava
tors and from the fact that the Canaanite goddesses Astarte and
Qudshu (or Qadesh) 44 always appear naked in Egyptian portrayals of this age, in striking contrast to the modestly garbed native Egyptian goddesses. Another dominant characteristic of
the Canaanite goddesses in question was their savagery. In
Egyptian sources Astarte and Anath are preeminently goddesses
of war; a favorite type of representation shows the naked
goddess astride a galloping horse and brandishing a weapon in
her right hand. In a fragment of the Baal epic which has just
been published (1938), Anath appears as incredibly sanguinary.



178 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
For a reason not yet known she massacres mankind, young and old, from the sea-coast to the rising of the sun, causing heads
and hands to fly in all directions. Then she ties heads to her back, hands to her girdle, and wades up to her knees yes, up to
her throat in human gore. 45 The favorite animals of the Canaanite goddess were the lion, because of its ferocity, and the
serpent and dove, because of their reputed fecundity.
Just as virginity and fertility appear side by side as char
acteristics of goddesses, so do emasculation and fecundity as contradictory features of gods. Emasculation appears often in
the myths collected by Philo, Lucian, and others; even El
castrates himself though he appears as the father of the gods
by numerous goddesses. El also castrates his own father, ac
cording to Philo. There can be no doubt that eunuchs played a
leading role in the cult of Bronze-Age Syria and Asia Minor,
and in certain periods even in Mesopotamia proper. The name
applied to them by the Western Semites was komer (which
already appears as kumrum in the cuneiform texts from Cappa
docia in the 19th century B. C), "
gallus," as we may confi
dently say after examining all early sources which mention this
word.46 That the term already designated
" male prostitute
"
(biblical qadesh) as well as " eunuch priest
"
(the meanings may have been practically interchangeable as in Graeco-Roman
times) is clear from the fact that kumru is found in an Egyptian text of the late second millennium with the determinative
" male dancer." 47 The popularity of sacred prostitution of both sexes among the later Syrians and Anatolians is well known. In
the late second millennium B. C. we find that one of the most common forms of the Syrian goddess is that of a naked woman
holding symbols of fertility such as lily stalks and serpents in
her upraised hands her name is " the holy one "
! A cult-stand of about the twelfth century B. C. from Beth-shan shows a remarkable tableau in relief: a nude goddess holds two doves in her arms as she sits with legs apart to show her sex; below her are two male deities with arms interlocked in a struggle (?),
with a dove at the feet of one of them; toward them from below creeps a serpent and from one side advances a lion. This may be considered as a terse epitome of the mythological
symbolism of Canaanite religion at the end of the pre-Israelite age in Palestine.



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD . . . 179
Before leaving this subject, it must be emphasized that there are many important parallels between Canaanite and Israelite temple-service and sacrificial ritual, as we know from such impeccable sources as the Marseilles Tariff, whose story is confirmed for the Late Bronze Age in a number of respects by the
ritual texts from Ugarit. A very interesting parallel from
Lachish has been reported to the " Times " by Sir Charles
Marston (July 8, 1939). In the 13th-century temple were found
many sacrificial bones, all from the right front leg of the
animal, just as in Mosaic ritual. The inference that this temple
was Israelite is contradicted by the well-known fact that the
same limb figures with equal insistence in the Assyro-Baby
lonian ritual, so that preference for it may safely be considered
as general throughout ancient Western Asia. There are also numerous points of contact between Canaanite and late Israelite
mythology and literature, as we shall see below. In view of the
geographical situation and the close similarity in language, it is very remarkable that parallels and points of contact remain so few.
B. THE HEBREW BACKGROUND OF ISRAELITE ORIGINS
1. The Geographical and Ethnic Background
The latest discoveries at Mari on the Middle Euphrates (see above, pp. Ill f.) have strikingly confirmed the Israelite tradi
tions according to which their Hebrew forefathers came to
Palestine from the region of Harran in northwestern Meso
potamia. The earlier migration from Ur of the Chaldees to
Harran remains without archaeological illustration (aside from the excavation: of the city itself) and the curious fact that the
Greek translators nowhere mention Ur but substitute the more natural "land (of the Chaldaeans)" suggests that the localiza
tion of Abraham's home at Ur was secondary and was not generally accepted in the third century B. C. Harran itself was
a flourishing city in the 19th and 18th century B. C., as we
know from: frequent references in our cuneiform sources. In
the time of Hammurabi it was under an Amorite prince. The city of Nahor, mentioned as the home of Rebekah's parents in
Gen. 24: 10, figures often as Nakhur in the Mari tablets as



180 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
well as in more recent Middle-Assyrian documents; it seems to have been located below Harran in the Balikh valley, to judge from both the Mari references and the Assyrian records of the
seventh century B.C., where Til-Nakhiri, "the Mound of Nakhuru," is the name of a town (with Assyrian vowel har
mony) in the Harran district.48 It was also ruled by an Amorite
prince in the 18th century B. C. In addition to the certain
location of the patriarchal cities Harran and Nahor in north
western Mesopotamia, we have hardly less clear indications in
the names of Abraham's forefathers which correspond to the
names of towns near Harran: Serug (Assyrian Sarugi, Syriac
Serug), Nahor, and Terah (Til Turakhi, "Mound of Terah,"
in Assyrian times, just as Nakhur had become Til-Nakhiri).
Peleg and perhaps Reu also correspond to later names of towns
in the Middle-Euphrates valley, but it is dangerous to push such
comparisons too far. 49 Besides these certain and probable geographical links between
the Hebrew Patriarchs and their traditional home in Padan
Aram, "the Plain of Aram" (Aram, paddana Heb. sadeh,
"field, plain"), we now have a wealth of other data pointing
to an original home of the Hebrew people in northern Meso
potamia, where they were under mixed Accadian, Hurrian, and
Amorite influence. Since the publication of the Nuzian documents of the 15th century B. C. it has become increasingly evident that the customary law reflected by the patriarchal stories of Genesis fits better into the framework of Nuzian
social and legal practice than it does into that of later Israel or into that of the Babylonian laws and economic documents of the 19th century or the similar Assyrian material of the 12th
century' B. C. Many striking parallels have been pointed out
by Sidney Smith, C. H. Gordon, E. A. Speiser, and others. 60 Moreover, the discovery of the Mari and related documents
from the 18th century B. C. is now bringing even more striking
parallels, especially in language and proper names: e. g., the
tribe of Benjamin and the name "Jacob." 51 When the eco
nomic tablets of Mari are published we shall doubtless find
many socio-legal similarities to the narratives of Genesis. The earlier cosmogonic and ethnogonic material of the first eleven
chapters of Genesis is mostly inexplicable unless we suppose



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 181
that it was brought from Mesopotamia to Palestine by the
Hebrews before the middle of the second millennium. Nothing like the matter contained in the pre-Priestly sources of Genesis
1-11 is found in Canaanite sources, whether we peruse the
mythological poems of Ugarit or the briefer but very pertinent
sketch given ,by Philo Byblius. Nor is there any hint of it in
our now fairly extensive miscellaneous evidence for Canaanite
beliefs and legends. In spite of A. S. Yahuda's imaginative
researches, there is no close parallel anywhere between Gen.
1-11 and Egyptian literature. On the other hand, the Meso
potamian parallels are many and striking, though they never
suggest direct borrowing from canonical Babylonian sources. It has been shown recently in detail that the situation can be
explained satisfactorily throughout if we suppose that the story of creation in Gen. 2, the story of Eden, the accounts of the
antediluvian patriarchs, the Flood-story, and the story of the
Tower of Babel were all brought from northwestern Meso
potamia to the West by the Hebrews before the middle of
the second millennium.52
The problem of the ethnic and linguistic background of the
Hebrew Patriarchs is hardly ripe for solution, since a vast quantity of relevant documentary material remains to be pub
lished and analyzed. However, a few cautious observations
may be made. The Israelites themselves believed in later times
that they descended from a "
fugitive Aramaean " ^Arammz
'obhedh, Deut. 26: 5), and their eastern relatives, with whom they maintained connubium for several generations, are always
called "Aramaean" in Genesis. On the other hand, in the
genealogical lists Eber, the ancestor of the Hebrews, is sharply
distinguished from Aram, whose brother Arphaxad (with a non-Semitic name!) appears as Eber's grandfather. Moreover,
in the lists of Abraham's offspring by Hagar and Keturah we
find North and South-Arabian tribes, some of which figure elsewhere as descendants of Eber through Joktan but not
through Abraham's direct ancestor, Peleg. In one passage both
Aramaean tribes and Chaldaeans are listed as descendants of Abraham's brother Nahor. The matter has been complicated in recent times by B. Moritz's discovery that most of the
nomadic tribes of Babylonia which figure in the Assyrian in
13



182 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
scriptions of the ninth-seventh centuries were really of Arab, not of Aramaean origin.
53 The nomadic Akhlamu who began
to settle in Syria and Mesopotamia about the twelfth century
B. C. may also have acquired both the name Aram and the
Aramaic dialect from their precursors. Without going into
further details, we can safely say that the Aramaean language sprang from a West-Semitic dialect spoken in northwestern
Mesopotamia in the early second millennium B. C., a dialect
which seems to have left clear traces in the Mari documents.
The Hebrew Patriarchs presumably spoke this dialect before
their settlement in Palestine, but there, at an uncertain period, they adopted a local Canaanite dialect which was not identical
with the standard speech of sedentary Canaanites, as may be
linguistically demonstrated. The genetic affiliations of the early Hebrews were probably so mixed that all the theories reflected
in later Israelite tradition have some justification. The fact that the standard genealogy in Gen. 11 made Eber son of the non
Semitic Arphaxad and that the Hebrew migration from Meso
potamia to Canaan may have been roughly contemporary with the movements which formed the prelude to the Hyksos Age
certainly suggests a composite ethnic origin, including Hurrian as well as Semitic elements. More and more evidence has accumulated to suggest that
the early Hebrews were connected in some way with the c
Apiru (Khapiru) ,
54 who play a very curious role in cuneiform documents of the 19th and 18th centuries, as well as in Nuzian, Hittite, and Amarna documents of the 15th-l4th centuries. In
Mesopotamia and Syria they appear as landless soldiers, raiders, captives, and slaves of miscellaneous ethnic origins; in Palestine they are often mentioned in Canaanite letters of the early 14th
century as raiders and as rebels against Egyptian authority, sometimes in alliance with Canaanite princes. Until recently
most scholars accepted the equation of the Khapiru (" Habiri,"
etc.) with the Hebrews, and the opposition of such eminent
scholars as E. Dhorme and B. Landsberger was based on ety
mologies now known to be erroneous. The discovery that the
true form of the name was *Apim complicates matters again.
However, Hebrew "Ibhn may well stand for an older *Iprt (by
a phonetic change common in that language and period) , which



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 183
may perfectly well reflect an adjectival form 'Apiru, by linguistic
processes of known validity in closely parallel circumstances.55
Until the question is decided, we must content ourselves with
saying that a Khapiru origin would square extraordinarily well
with Hebrew traditional history and would clear up many
details which seem otherwise inexplicable.
It is not our intention here to dwell on the history of the Patriarchal Age in Palestine. So many corroborations of de
tails have been discovered in recent years that most competent
scholars have given up the old critical theory according to which the stories of the Patriarchs are mostly retrojections from the
time of the Dual Monarchy (9th-8th centuries B.C.). Con
flicting versions of a given episode in the J and E documents
warn us against depending too slavishly on the present form
of the tradition. On the other hand they are altogether too
close in form and content to be of distinct origin, especially
when we remember that much close parallelism between them
has presumably been eliminated by die redactor, who saw no
purpose in unnecessary repetition (see above, p. 46). The
most reasonable view is that of R. Kittel, that they reflect different recensions of an old national epic, based on poems
which came down, like the lost source of Genesis 14, from the Patriarchal Age. The attempt of so great an authority on verse as E. Sievers to scan most of Genesis as poetry, at least illus
trates its poetic flavor. A unitary background for J and E is also
suggested by their remarkably homogeneous characterizations
of the Patriarchs. The figures of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
Joseph appear before us as real personalities, each one of whom
shows traits and qualities which suit his character but would not harmonize with the characters of the others. This is par
ticularly true of Jacob and Joseph. The Joseph story does,
indeed, exhibit distinctly folkloristic elements, some of which are essential features of the stories of Adonis, Attis, and Bitis, but the picture of Joseph which we get from them is not in the
least mythological, so we must probably reckon with the uni
versal human tendency to adjust elements of a story to a familiar
pattern (see above, p. 36) ,
56
The Egyptian sojourn of Israel is a vital part of early Israelite historical tradition, and cannot be eliminated without leaving



184 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
an inexplicable gap. Moreover, we know from the Egyptian
names of Moses and a number of the Aaronids that part of Israel must have lived for a long time in Egypt.
57 Then there
are a great many correct local and antiquarian details which
would be inexplicable as later inventions. Most striking is the
obvious relation in which the Joseph story and the later history
of Israel in Egypt stand to the Hyksos movement. The "
king who knew not Joseph
" and who oppressed the Israelites should
be a pharaoh of the New Empire, after the expulsion of the
hated Asiatics from Egypt. With this agrees the fact that the
Israelites were settled around the Hyksos capital of Egypt, in the "plain of Tanis" (Zoan, Psalms 78: 12,43). That there
was a long Semitic occupation of the northeastern Delta before
the New Empire is certain from the Canaanite place-names
found there in the New Empire, which include Succoth, Baal
zephon, Migdol, Zilu (Sillo), and probably Goshen itself.58 That there were a good many Semites among Hyksos officials
is certain, 59 and it is also clear that most of the Hyksos chiefs
bore Semitic names, among which is Ya'qob-har (literally,
"May the Mountain-god Protect"), formed with the element
"Jacob." It is impossible to separate the tradition quoted in
Num. 13: 22, according to which Hebron was founded seven years before Tanis, from the Hyksos invasion of Egypt, and
difficult to separate the Hyksos era of Tanis, according to which 400 years had elapsed at a time shortly before the accession of
Ramesses I (1320 B. C), from the 430 years assigned in Ex.
12: 40 for the duration of the Israelite sojourn in the district
of Tanis.60 In short, it must be considered as practically certain that the ancestors of part of Israel, at least, had lived for several centuries in Egypt before migrating to Palestine.
2. The Religious Background
There are some relatively secure types of evidence for the
pre-Mosaic religion of the Hebrews. The Israelites recognized
that their ancestors, who lived beyond the Euphrates, had
"served other gods" (Jos. 24:2). The chief god of the
Patriarchs was believed to have been Shaddai, as we read again
and again in the Priestly Code (confirmed by the evidence of
personal names, three of which appear in Numbers while one,



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 185
Shaddai-*ammt^ is attested by a contemporary Egyptian in
scription), and several other divine names are reported. Later
tradition recognized the deliberate choice of God by each
successive patriarchal generation, and A. Alt (1929) has
demonstrated the antiquity and importance of the principle.
62
There is some valuable material available in the personal names
of the early Hebrews, including names from the first generation or two after the Exodus. Since this last body of evidence is
the most objective from the standpoint of the historical critic
we shall consider it first.
The early Hebrew onomasticon consists quite largely of
abbreviated names (hypocoristica) such as Yishaq (Isaac),
Yffqobb (Jacob), Yosepb (Joseph), Yeh&dah (Judah), Gad,
Dan, etc., which are of no direct value for our present purpose.
It also fortunately includes a large number of names containing
an appellation of deity: el, "god"; sur, "mountain" (Aram. fur); shaddai "(god) of the mountain (s)."
63 In addition
there are many names containing the elements *amm, "
kindred, family, folk"; ab, "father"; akb, "brother." There has been
much discussion of the first word, which has the meaning
"paternal uncle" in Arabic, especially since this sense can be shown to exist in South Arabic at least as early as the seventh
century B. C. However, since Heb. *am always means " kindred, folk, people," and since the Babylonian scholars of the second millennium B. C. correctly translated this element (where it
occurs in Amorite names like Hammurabi, Ammisaduqa) as
"
family," we are certainly justified in adopting this meaning
the only one which suits many of the names containing it: e. g.,
Rehabh'am (Rehoboam), "Let (my) People be Widened." "
The terms of relationship which appear in this group of names
are nearly always interchangeable with the word el, "god," so it has been generally recognized by recent students that they
also refer to deity. Names of these two types were already
common in Semitic in the pre-Accadian age, as we know from the fact that they are relatively abundant in Old Accadian
documents (25th-23rd centuries), and they became progressively
less common as time went on; they are also much more frequent
in Old Assyrian records (20th-19th century) than later. In Amorite nomenclature of the period between 2100 and 1600



186 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
B. C. they abounded; in Canaanite they were much less common and the element *amm has not yet been identified in a definitely
Canaanite milieu. In Israel both types of name were in common
use until the tenth century, after which they went out of use rapidly and new names belonging to them ceased to be coined.
Since H. Ranke's convincing demonstration (1937) 65 that both Egyptian and Western-Asiatic sentence-names (i. e., names
which form a sentence, as most unabbreviated Semitic names
did in antiquity) represent utterances of a parent or person with authority at the birth of a child, it is easier to understand
their connotation. Such names contain a vow or invocation to a god, or a statement of good omen connected in some way
with a god. A name such as Yishmtf-el means " May El Hear "
;
Elt-sur is
" My God is (verily) a Mountain (in whom I can
trust)"; Peda-sur means "May the Mountain Redeem (me
from suffering)"; Shaddai-or (Shedeur) is "The One of the Mountain (s) Shines (shows favor to me)"; Eli- abb means
"My God is Father (to me)"; *Ammi-el is "(the god of)
my Kindred is God (to me) "
; Akhi-ezet means " My (divine)
Brother is (my) Help," etc. In most abbreviated personal
names, we must assume that the second element was originally
a name or appellation of deity, usually El: e.g., Ytfqobh is an
abbreviation of Ya*qobh-el9 "May El Protect," which actually
appears as a personal name in northwestern Mesopotamia (18th
century) and as a Palestinian place-name in an Egyptian list of the 15th century B. C.; Yishaq stands for Yisbaq-el9 "May
El Smile (favorably upon me in my distress) ." These illustra
tions, which can easily be multiplied, throw much light on the
pre-Mosaic religion of the Hebrews. Two facts emerge im
mediately. First, the principal deity of the pre-Mosaic Hebrews
was a mountain god, or was invested with mountain imagery.
This also appears, incidentally, in two names of early Hyksos
chiefs, formed with the element Ear, "
Mountain-god." The mountain-deity in question is clearly the storm-god Hadad, generally called Baal (lord) by the Canaanites, and often addressed as "great mountain," or the like, in Accadian invocations to Amurru, the "Western One," i.e., the storm-god of
the West. The second fact is that the Hebrews, like their
nomadic Semitic forefathers, possessed a very keen sense of



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 187
the relationship between a patriarchal group (clan or family)
and its deity, who was therefore an actual member of the
clan and could be addressed by a mortal kinsman as "
father, brother," and even as "kindred." All the members of the
clan were, accordingly, children, brethren, or kinsmen of the
god, who was the head of the house (family). Among the
Amorites and Aramaeans of the late second and early first millennia the expressions "belonging to the house of" and
" son of " are interchangeable, as we know from scores of
examples in the Bible and especially in the Assyrian and
Aramaean inscriptions. Consequently, the god who is con
sidered as patron of a family or a dynasty was called " the
lord of the house " among the Aramaeans of the ninth and eighth centuries B. C, as has just been pointed out by Euler
(1939).66 In the early first millennium the Aramaeans are
known to have named their children " Son of (god) Hadad,"
etc., and this custom later became very popular among the
pagans of Syria and Mesopotamia in the early Christian age.
67
There is no solid basis for the idea which is sometimes ex
pressed that there was a kind of " El " monotheism among
the early Western Semites and in particular among the early
Hebrews. It is true that very few specific names of gods appear among them during the nomadic or semi-nomadic stage and that the use of different appellations of gods in personal names seems to increase rapidly under sedentary conditions. However,
there are too many divine names known to have been common to the ancestors of the various Semitic peoples, and there is
too much evidence for polytheistic beliefs among the earliest South Arabians after the eighth century B. C. to warrant any such hypothesis. D. Nielsen has clarified the situation by
showing that early South-Arabian pantheons were often organ
ized in triads of father, mother, and son; he has also made it
probable that the system of triads was proto-Semitic, though
he has gone much too far in trying to carry it through Near
Eastern polytheism in general.
68 We pointed out above (p. 127) that such triads are archaeologically illustrated in neolithic
Jericho, not later than the sixth millennium. Early Hebrew
popular religion was presumably similar, with a father, El, a
mother whose specific name or names must remain obscure



188 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
(perhaps Elat or Anath), and a son who appears as the storm
god, probably named Shaddai, " the One of the Mountain (s)."
It is only reasonable to suppose that there were also other
minor divinities whose existence was recognized by different groups. Whether there was a sharp line of demarcation be
tween El and Shaddai is questionable, in view of the fluidity
of all known early Semitic pantheons. It is most unlikely that
the element el in early Hebrew names refers exclusively to the all-father El; it may also have been a surrogate for another
divine name (i. e., the god) or even in some cases a more
fluid dynamistic expression for impersonal supernatural power.69 It must similarly be emphasized that the fluid conception of the god of a clan as being its blood relative takes root in
dynamistic and corporative ideas of great antiquity. As Alt has pointed out (1929) there is no reason to doubt
that the divine appellations of Genesis 14-35 formed with the element El are pre-Israelite, since they are generally mentioned
in connection with very early shrines. 70 This observation yields
several important early Hebrew divine names, all of which
were prefixed in Hebrew tradition by the generic name for
"
deity," which is grammatically very incongruous in one case
(el-B$th*el or even hdel-Beth*el}. Four names are known:
*Elydn, "the Lofty One "; 'dlam, "the Eternal One," literally
" (God of) Eternity
"
; Bttfrel (Bethel) ,
" the House of God "
;
Ro*i, possibly meaning
" the One who Sees me." Since no fewer than three of these names occur as appellations of deity in Canaanite sources, it is clear that they are very ancient West-Semitic names for the all-father or the lord of heaven
(the storm-god). Again they point to the nobility of early
Hebrew conceptions of their high god or gods. Three of them recur in later Hebrew sources: two, "Elydn and 'Olam (usually
in a genitive compound) in biblical literature, and one, Betfcel, in the records of Elephantine.
As Alt has shown, biblical traditions with regard to the God of the Fathers are not of secondary origin, as has been rashly
assumed by critical scholars, but actually reflect pre-Mosaic
Hebrew religious ideas. This is particularly true of the names
applied to them in our earliest sources: the " God of Abra
ham"; the "Kinsman (pahad) of Isaac"; the "Champion



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD . . . 189
of Jacob." Much difficulty has been caused by the
current translation of the archaic appellation pahad as "
terror/'
whereas it should probably be rendered "
kindred, kinsman,"
as in later Palmyrene. 71 Each Patriarch is represented by
Hebrew tradition as choosing his God for himself, and as
selecting a different manifestation of Yahweh, the later God of Israel. Alt has illustrated the practice of choosing one's god
from Aramaic and Arabic paganism of the first Christian cen
turies, but closer parallels have been subsequently adduced by
J: Lewy (1934) from the Old Assyrian inscriptions of the 20th
century B. C, and by others from the Nuzian contracts of the 15th century and the Aramaic inscriptions of the eighth cen
tury. We can, accordingly, trace the existence among the early
Hebrews of two conceptions, both characteristic of their environment: 1. a dynamistic belief in an undefined but real
blood relationship between a family or clan and its god(s) ;
2. a recognition of the right of an independent man or founder
of a clan to choose his own personal god, with whom he is expected to enter into a kind of contractual relationship. In
combination, these ideas must have led to a form of tribal religion where both the collective and the personal aspects of deity were present, the former in tribal acts of religious nature and the latter in individual worship.
C. THE RELIGION OF MOSES
1. The Documentary Sources
In all three of the parallel pentateuchal documents (J, E, P)
the figure of Moses dominates the early national life of Israel.
The older sources, J and E, agree in the main with regard to the role of Moses and the leading events of his life. In view of
the principle of adding differences and eliminating unnecessary
repetition which was characteristic of ancient oriental compilers,
we may be sure that the parallelism between J and E was
originally much closer than appears in their present form.
As we have seen in dealing with the account of the Patriarchs
in Genesis, J and E must reflect two recensions of an original
epic narrative, the nucleus of which had presumably been re
cited by Hebrew rhapsodists before the Exodus. It is possible



190 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
that this epic included the story of Moses's early life and the Exodus, though the historical break between the Patriarchal
Age and the time of Moses does not favor such a view. It is
more likely that the whole story of Moses was added to the epic nucleus soon after the Conquest of Canaan and that the
combined narrative (whether in verse or prose we can hardly say) was recited by Levites or rhapsodists until the break-up of the amphictyonic organization under Philistine blows in the
eleventh century B. C. Thereafter, we may suppose, the two
recensions J (in the south) and E (in the north) were sepa
rately transmitted, being written down not later than 750 B. C. and combined in the JE recension during the eighth or seventh
century B. C. It is not necessary to repeat the arguments which have convinced several generations of scholars that J is the oldest docu
ment, containing earlier and later elements (L or Ji and J or
J2 ), which were put into substantially their present form be
tween cir. 925 B. C. (Division of the Monarchy) and 750 B. C.,
and that J was particularly interested in Judah. The recent
effort of Volz and Rudolph (1933-1938) to show that E is not,
after all, a primary source but simply represents supplementary
material added to J, has convinced but few scholars and does
not do justice to the homogeneity of these additions, nor to the
principles according to which such compilations were made
(see above) . That E is later than J and represents a northern
tradition is generally agreed. There has lately been a tendency to adopt lower dates than the standard ones held since Well
hausen's Prolegomena, according to which we must date J cir.
850, E cir. 750 B. C. This tendency may possibly be correct,
as far as concerns the date when J and E were first put into
writing; it is emphatically wrong with respect to the time of their first oral or written composition in substantially their
present form, since the discovery of the Lachish Letters (1935)
has proved that such fine classical Hebrew as we find in the JE narrative must be considerably earlier than the end of the
preexilic Jewish state. Its close grammatical and stylistic resemblance to the account of David's later life in Samuel, which cannot have been written after the tenth century B. C., brings
us to a date not too1 long after 925 B. C. So we come again to



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 191
the accepted date between 925 and 750 B. C. for the original content of both J and E. S. A. Cook and others are certainly right in placing the date of the later elements in JE after the
height of the Prophetic Age,72 but we shall see that the latter must be dated in the ninth century, not in the eighth. Since the date of the pentateuchal documents is a very im
portant question, we may be pardoned for observing at this point that a reexamination of JE's Table of Nations (Gen. 10) ,
in the light of our latest information regarding geographical
names and ethnic movements in the ancient Near East, points
to a period preceding the eighth century B. C., since not a word is said about several important peoples and nations which then
came into the limelight for the first time. Apparent exceptions,
such as the mention of the Cimmerians and Scythians, are now
being eliminated, since these peoples had certainly emerged upon the Syro-Phoenician horizon at a considerably earlier date than has often been supposed, judging only from cuneiform
references. 73 It seems increasingly probable that Gen. 10 is
derived largely from a document of the tenth century B. C.;
the references to Assyria and Arabia fit this general period
better than any other. 74
It follows from the foregoing observations that J and E do
not, as a rule, give independent traditions regarding the life of Moses and the beginnings of Israel, but rather reflect the official
version as it was known in the eleventh century B. C. However, it is highly improbable that substantial alterations were made
in its form during the period of the Judges. We must naturally assume, as in other parallel cases, a short period during which traditions and legends were first told, were repeated, and were collected into some sort of standard form. Thereafter changes would be comparatively few, as long as the standard version
continued to be recited. After it had been broken into two
strands, J and E, changes would become much more frequent, but are subject to our control because of the two independent
lines of tradition. Moreover, the story of Moses must have been too well known in the age of the prophets and too well controlled by written sources accessible to scribes to permit of
much unauthorized variation from the standard form. Further
more, as we shall see below, J and E are supplemented by P,



192 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
which very often goes back to quite independent oral and
written sources. Since many traditions imbedded in our three sources were actually formed and even phrased at different
times, we have a staggered chronological relationship between them which greatly enhances their historical dependability.
In spite of the four centuries or so during which stories of Moses's life were transmitted orally before being put into fixed
form, they ought, accordingly, to be at least as historically
reliable as the accounts of Zoroaster and Gautama (Buddha),
which were transmitted much longer by oral tradition. The Priestly Code is also important as an historical source for the Mosaic period. It is very different in character from the older J and E, but, in contrast to them, it belongs to a scribal circle which was interested in questions of chronology and
topography, ritual and liturgy, and which unquestionably had
access to early written documents. Moreover, it was also the
result of a complex process of collecting and sifting tradition,
as is clearly shown by the doublets in the description of the
Tabernacle, etc. Its language and style are, in general, older than that of the writings of the Deuteronomic school, though
its composition in its present form must be later and can hardly
be preexilic
75 A warning against dating it too late is provided by such archaic documents as the list of tribal heads and their
offerings in Num. 7, which can no longer be dismissed as ficti
tious. 76 A warning against dating it too early is furnished by
the variant lists of the Israelite tribal census in Num. 2 and 26,
which have been proved to be recensional doublets with a long manuscript tradition behind them. Since the original census
must have belonged to the United Monarchy and probably to
the time of David (II Sam. 24) , we must allow considerable time for the differences in manuscript transmission to have
arisen. 77 In brief, the material preserved in P is more hetero
geneous both in date and content than that of JE, and conse
quently less reliable on the average. On the other hand, some
of it, resting on early written sources, is perhaps more de
pendable for historical purposes than anything in JE. We must again emphasize the fact that alphabetic Hebrew writing was
employed in Canaan and neighboring districts from the Pa
triarchal Age on, and that the rapidity with which forms of



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 193
letters changed is clear evidence of common use. It is certain
that the Hebrew alphabet was written with ink and used for
every-day purposes in the 14th and 13th centuries B. C. (Lach
ish, Beth-shemesh, Megiddo), that quantities of papyrus were
exported from Egypt to Phoenicia about 1100 B. C. (Wen
amun) , that writing was practiced by a youth of Gideon's time
(early eleventh century) , that it was known in Shiloh before 1050 B. C, that several examples of writing from Iron I (cir.
1200-900 B. C.) have been found in Israelite Palestine, and that
David had a staff of secretaries. In the light of these facts,
hypercriticism with regard to the authenticity of much of the
material preserved by P is distinctly unscholarly, and its inde
pendent attestation of facts given by J and E is a valuable
guarantee of their historicity. It is even less likely that there
is deliberate invention or "
pious
"
forgery in P than in JE, in view of the well attested reverence which ancient Near-Eastern scribes had for the written tradition (see above, p. 45).
2. The Historical Foundations of Israelite Tradition
Steering as cautiously as possible between the Scylla of over
reliance on tradition and the Charybdis of hypercriticism, we
may confidently assume that Moses was a Hebrew who was
born in Egypt and reared under strong Egyptian influence. This
is independently attested by his clearly Egyptian name, supported by the Egyptian names current among his Aaronid kin
dred for two centuries. It is true that the sibilant in the name Mosheh (from the Egyptian abbreviated name Mase, pro
nounced Mose after the twelfth century B. C. and probably
sounding very much 1'kc it in the Delta a century or two earlier)
is differently treated from that in the name Pinehas (from
Egyptian Pi-nehasey
" the Nubian "), but the spelling of the latter evidently rests on correct oral tradition, while that of the
former reproduces orthographically the exact letter with which
the name had to be written in Canaanite alphabetic characters in the 13th century B. C. (since samekh was then always used
to transcribe an entirely distinct sound, ts or tsh} . The name
Pinehas, of which we have just spoken, is interesting as providing an independent (and absolutely reliable) confirmation



194 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
of the tradition that there was a Nubian element in the family
of Moses (Num. 12: 1).
The tradition in Ex. 1 that the Israelites were forced by the
Egyptian corvee to take part in the construction of the store
cities Pithom and Raamses is also independently supported by the excavations at Tell Retabeh (Pithom, which is not Tell
el-Maskhutah == Succoth, as formerly supposed) and Tanis, both of which were built (or rebuilt) by Ramesses II. Since
Tanis was called Per-Re'emasese (The House of Ramesses) only
for a couple of centuries (cir. 1300-1100), it is most improbable
that the tradition could arise if it were spurious. With our
present knowledge of the topography of the eastern Delta the account of the start of the Exodus given in Ex. 12: 37 and
13: 20 if, is perfectly sound topographically, and Alan Gardiner,
who long objected to its historicity on topographical grounds, has recently withdrawn his objections (1933).
78 Many addi
tional pieces of evidence for the substantial historicity of the account of the Exodus and the wandering in the regions of
Sinai, Midian, and Kadesh can easily be given, thanks to our
greatly increased knowledge of topography and archaeology.
We must content ourselves here with the assurance that there is no longer any room for the still dominant attitude of hypercriticism toward the early historical traditions of Israel. Even
the long contested date of the Exodus can now be fixed within reasonable limits. In 1937 the discovery in the remains of the latest Canaanite Lachish of a hieratic inscription dated to the
year 1231 B.C. (or possibly somewhat later, but in no case earlier) proved that the fall of this town into Israelite hands
took place in or after that year. Moreover, the long known, but often misinterpreted, text of the Israel stele of Marniptah,
which is dated in 1229 B. C, proves that Israel was already in Western Palestine in force (see below, p. 212), but had not yet
settled down (the name is written with the determinative for
tc
foreign people/' instead of "
foreign land ").
79 If we allow
the generation (" forty years ") which Israelite tradition de
mands, we thus arrive at a date not later than cir. 1260 for the
Exodus. However^ it is very probable that we must allow a generation for the Israelite occupation of Eastern Palestine and advance westward in force, so a date in the early 13th century



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 195
is safest for the Exodus. If we place it about 1290 B. C. we
can hardly be far wrong, since the early years of Ramesses II
(1301-1234) were largely occupied with building operations
in the city to which he gave his name, the Raamses of Israelite
tradition. The striking agreement between this date and that
of 430 years given in Ex. 12: 40, if we suppose that it belongs
to the era of Tanis (cir. 1720 B. C.), may, of course, be purely
accidental, but it is very remarkable.
Archaeological investigation has also shed some light on the situation in that general age in Sinai, Midian, and the Negeb
of Palestine. There were as yet no towns or stationary camps,
except probably in Edom, where Nelson Glueck has discovered
a sedentary occupation going back to the 12th or 13th century.
At the ancient site of Ezion-geber or Elath near e
Aqabah
Glueck' s recent excavations (1938-40) have proved that the
first buildings were erected on virgin soil in the tenth century
B. C. At Kadesh-barnea (*Ain el-Qudeirat) , the oldest fortress
belongs also to about the tenth century. In Sinai proper there
were intermittently worked copper mines at Wadi Magharah
and Serabit el-Khadem, but the former appear to have been
virtually abandoned after the Middle Empire, whereas the latter
were exploited on a large scale under nearly every pharaoh of
the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, down to Ramesses
VI (cir. 1140 B. C.) ; inscriptions of Ramesses II were particu
larly abundant in the temple there, which has been excavated
by Petrie (1905) and Starr (1930). To judge from the 'pot
sherds picked up by Glueck around the copper mines of the "Arabah, just west and south of Edom, intensive working began
there in the Early Iron Age, but no exact date can be set. Since Midian (the region south and southeast of 'Aqabah) is much richer in copper ores than either Sinai or Edom, it is hardly
possible that the Midianites of Moses's time had not begun to
exploit them, especially since there were excellent customers
close at hand in Egypt and Canaan. The marriage of Moses to
the daughter of a Midianite priest, variously named Jethro and Reuel, is exceptionally well attested by Israelite tradition, since
it appears repeatedly in different connections and since the
family of Reuel's son Hobab, Moses's friend, became Israelite
(Num. 10: 29, Jud. 4: 11). The clan in question, moreover, is



196 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
repeatedly named " Kenite," i. e.,
"
belonging to the copper
smith (s)"; cf. Gen. 4:22 and Arab, gain, Aram, qainaya,
" smith." In short, Sinai and Midian were at that time far from being the domain of barbarous camel-nomads, but were
actually occupied by semi-sedentary tribes which were connected
by close ties of commerce and industry with Egypt and Canaan.
It is interesting to note that camels are mentioned only once in the whole of the Pentateuch, aside from probably anachronistic allusions in a few passages in Genesis and from the mention
of the camel among unclean animals (cf. p. 120 on the transi
tion from ass-nomadism to camel-nomadism shortly before
1100 B. C.) . The Israelites of the wilderness wanderings were,
therefore, definitely ass-nomads and were, accordingly, re
stricted to just such a route as is marked out for them in Num. 33, where they were never far from oases or from the pasture
lands of the Negeb and Transjordan.
3. Moses and Monotheism
We are handicapped in dealing with this subject by the fact
that all our literary sources are relatively late, as we have seen,
and that we must therefore depend upon a tradition which was long transmitted orally. Many scholars go so far as to deny the
historian any right to use these sources to determine what the
religion of Moses actually was. Under the circumstances we must content ourselves with establishing certain facts and some
other probabilities. In the first place, it is absurd to deny that
Moses was actually the founder of the Israelite commonwealth and the framer of Israel's religious system. This fact is em
phasized so unanimously by tradition that it may be regarded
as absolutely certain. Nowhere is there the slightest breath of
doubt cast on this irrefragable fact by Israelite tradition. If we regard Zoroaster, Buddha, and Confucius as the founders of
nomistic religions we cannot deny this right to Moses. In this
case we are no more justified in insisting that the religion intro
duced by Moses was radically different from that of the Book
of Exodus than we should be in trying to divorce the other
higher religions which we have named from their founders. The Pentateuch reflects a series of traditions coming from circles
in which the " law of Moses " was the ultimate standard. In



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 197
order to determine the details of this law there had to be priests
or scribes whose primary function it was to preserve and
transmit them. As has recently been pointed out by S. Gandz
(1935), there was a class of priests who are called by Jeremiah
(2:8) "holders of the law" (tdfese hat-t6rab)> with name
and function which remind us of the Moslem " holders " (huffaz) of the Qur'an. 80 In many ways the transmission of
the Torah must have resembled that of the Tradition (hadzth)
in Islam; the apparent lack of the validating
" chain "
(isnad}
in Israel is presumably due to the anonymity of authors and
scholars there (aside from the prophets of the eighth century
and later).
81 In the course of time a great many laws and
practices which can hardly have been Mosaic were introduced into Israel; their lateness is often established by comparison
of the forms which they assume in JE, D, and P, which show
a progressive development first adequately emphasized by Wellhausen. There is absolute unanimity in our sources about the name
given his God by Moses. The spelling YHWH (pronounced
Yahweh^ as we know from Greek transcriptions) is always
found in prose passages in the Hebrew Bible, as well as in the
Mesha Stone (ninth century) and the Lachish Letters (cir. 589 B. C). Beside this fuller form there was also a normally
abbreviated form Yahu (the jussive form of the imperfect
causative which appears in Yabweh)?* which is found in all
early personal names (shortened in northern Israel to -yauand after the Exile to -yah} . It has often been maintained in
the past thirty years that Yahu is more original than Yahweh,
but all the epigraphic and linguistic facts are utterly opposed
to this paradoxical view. It has also been insisted that this or
that earlier non-Israelite divine name or element in a personal
name shows the existence of the prototype of the Tetragrammaton before Moses. In itself this is not impossible, but every
single suggestion has been effectively disproved, including the
latest from Ugarit, where Virolleaud suggests that a word yiv is identical with Yahweh. Unfortunately, the context does not lend itself in the least to such an interpretation, and the sup
posed yw should probably be read yr,
<c
offspring," which suits
the context well, so far as it is preserved. 88 It is well known



198 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
today that the most plausible of the older suggestions, Accadian
yaum in the name Yaum-ilu, means simply
" Mine (is the
god)/' Many different meanings have been attributed to
Yahweh by scholars who recognized its relative antiquity, but
only one yields any suitable sense: "He causes to be." The
other suggestions,
" He blows, He fells, He loves, He is kindly," etc., are totally without parallel in ancient Near-Eastern ono
mastics. 84 It is objected that " to cause to be " is too abstract
a meaning for so early a period. This again is erroneous, since
Egyptian and Accadian texts of pre-Mosaic days swarm with
illustrations of this idea, beginning with the Pyramid Texts.
Linguistically the form yahweh can only be causative, and to
judge from many analogies in Babylonia, Egypt, and Canaan,
it is an abbreviation of a longer name or litanic formula. A few
illustrations must suffice. In Sumerian Babylonia the name
Shagan (later Shakkan}, belonging to the god of animal husbandry, is an abbreviation of Ama-shagan-gub,
" He who Assists Bearing Mothers"; Dumuzi (later Tammuz) stands for
Dumu-zid-abzu\ Asari (a name of Marduk) represents the
fuller Asari-lu-dug\ Gish stands for Gishbilgamesh (later (?//
gamesh), etc. Similar abbreviated formulae are common as
divine names in later Accadian and Egyptian religion: cf.
Accadian Asusku-namer, Usur-amatsa, and Egyptian lusas, etc. It is, indeed, probable that many Egyptian names of gods are
just as abbreviated as the names of kings and commoners are
known to be in all early periods; e.g., the name Osiris is
probably an abbreviation of the fuller Osiris-onnophris. A most remarkable illustration comes from the Canaanite religion of
the 15th century B. C, where the standing appellation of the storm-god, Baal, usually given as Al'iyan, appears in its full
form as " I prevail (*al*iyu) over the champions whom I meet
in the land of battle." 85 The abbreviated name accordingly
means simply
" I will surely prevail." The enigmatic formula
in Ex. 3: 14, which' in biblical Hebrew means " I am what I
am," if transposed into the form in the third person required
by the causative Yahweh, can only become Yahweh asher
yibweh (later yihyeb), "He Causes to be what Comes into Existence." Later this formula was modified, presumably be
cause the old causative was no longer used in later Hebrew.



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 199
In the dialect of Moses the formula may even have been
Yahweh ze-yihu>eh, employing the ze which appears as a rela
tive preposition in Canaanite and poetic Hebrew as well as in
the appellation of Yahweh in Jud. 5: 5, Ze-Sinai,
" the One of
Sinai "
(as first pointed out by H. Grimme, in accordance with
widespread West-Semitic usage).86 If the ..restored formula
were isolated one would be justified despite the evidence in
suspecting its correctness, but we have it again and again in
Egyptian texts of the second millennium B. C: "(a god) who
causes to be (or who creates) what comes into existence "
(e. g.,
repeatedly in the great hymn to Amun from the 15th century
B. C.); Even if this view should prove to be wrong, there is ample evidence in the Bible that the Israelites had always
regarded Yahweh as Creator of All.
Another original characteristic of the Israelite God was that
He stood alone, without any family connections, whether con
sort, son, or daughter. The nearest approach to attributing a
family to Him that we meet before the Exile is the term bene
El or ben$ ha-elohim, " sons of God/' employed for the angels,
but this expression which was borrowed, as we shall see, from Canaanite does not necessarily have any more concrete meaning than does the frequent reference to the Israelites as children
of God; both angels and Israelites were created by God and
consequently might be poetically called His " children/'
Still another equally original characteristic of Yahweh is that
He is not restricted to any special abode. As the lord of all
cosmic forces, controlling sun, moon, and storm but not identified with any of them, His normal dwelling-place is in heaven,
from which He may come down, either to a lofty mountain like
Sinai, to a shrine like the Tabernacle, or to any spot which He
may choose. It is very significant that early Israelite poetry
refers in only the most general terms to Mount Seir and Edom
(Song of Deborah) , to Teman and Mount Paran (the hymn
imbedded in Habakkuk 3), to Sinai, Seir, and Paran (Deut.
33). The early Israelites laid so little stress on the exact spot
that even the name of the mountain varies in our prose sources
(Sinai or Horeb) . This does not mean that it was not a sacred
spot, but that there was no special cult associated with it, so
the precise name and location were unimportant. The same



200 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
situation is found in the early Christian church with reference
to the location of the inn where Jesus was born and the tomb in which He was buried. The frequently stated view that Sinai
must have been a volcano, a view popularized by A. Musil and Ed. Meyer, is without any solid basis. J. Morgenstern has
effectively shown that the biblical theophany of Yahweh in
Ex. 19 must be explained through the Hebrew imagery con
nected with the Glory of Yahweh (kebbodh YHWH) .
87 There
is no volcano, active or extinct, in all Sinai or Midian proper. However, in adjacent regions of Hauran and Arabia there are many volcanoes which must have been active within the past
few thousands of years. It is, therefore, quite possible that the
sublime picture of the theophany in Exodus 19 was ultimately influenced by folk memories of volcanic eruptions (preserved
in myth or metaphor) , combined with more recent recollections of terrific thunder-storms in the mountains of northwestern Arabia or Syria. In other words, the sublime description of the theophany may owe certain features to the two most majestic spectacles vouchsafed to mankind: a sub-tropical thunder-storm
and a volcanic eruption. We cannot emphasize too strongly
that the principle of skeuomorphism (above, pp. 30, 81) operates even more frequently in the world of ideas than it does
in that of objects.
88 Many ideas whose origin cannot be explained from the culture or the environment in which they are found, have been taken over from an entirely different cultural
environment where they have a perfectly logical explanation. Just as there is nothing in the Mosaic tradition which de
mands a derivation of Yahweh from an original volcanic deity
or storm-god, so there is nothing which requires us to explain
Him as a modified moon-god. It is improbable that the name
Sinai is derived from that of Sumerian Zen (older Zu-eri)>
Accadian Sin, the moon-god worshipped at Ur (in his form
Nannar) and at Harran, since there is no indication that the
name Sin was ever employed by the Canaanites or the Semitic
nomads of Palestine. 89 It is much more likely that the name Smai is connected with the place-name S?#, which belongs to a desert plain in Sinai as well as to a Canaanite city in Syria and perhaps to a city in the northeastern Delta of Egypt. It has also
long been recognized that it may somehow be connected with



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 201
seneh (Aram, sanya) , the name o a kind of bush where Moses
is said to have first witnessed the theophany o Yahweh. The
usual aetiological explanation is inadequate, though possible. Fundamental to early Israelite religion and profoundly
rooted in Mosaic tradition is the anthropomorphic conception
of Yahweh. Among the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and
Canaanites we find tendencies in this direction, but the concept
of deity remained fluid and subject to extraordinary variation.
Without considering the primitive dynamistic and corporative
elements inherent in the concept of deity in the ancient Near
East, we have only to glance at the mythologies, .he ico
nographies, and the litanies to see that Near-Eastern gods
shifted in disconcerting fashion from astral form to zoomorphic,
dendromorphic, and composite manifestations. Yahweh, on the
other hand, is virtually always referred to in the earlier sources
in a way which suggests His human form though His body was
usually hidden in a refulgent envelope called His Glory
(kabhodh} . The most drastic and at the same time the clearest
and presumably the most archaic illustration is the passage
Ex. 33: 23, where by special grace Moses sees Yahweh's back but not His face,
" for there shall no man see Me and live."
In the same way He appears in the early sources as having
traits of human psychology, such as capacity for love and
hatred, joy and sorrow, revenge and remorse, though always on a heroic plane.
90
There has been a great deal of futile writing about the
anthropomorphism of early Israel. First of all, we must be very
cautious in using material from the stories of Genesis 1-11, since most of this goes back to the Patriarchal Age, sometimes
perhaps in its very wording (e. g., Gen. 6: 1-4). To be sure,
some of these stories are more recent and they have nearly all been more or less influenced by later monotheistic conceptions
(so for example in the Story of the Flood when compared with
the cuneiform version) . Similarly, we must be careful not to
make uncritical deductions as to Mosaic or later Israelite religion from the narratives of the Patriarchs (Gen. 12-50), most
of which come down, as we have seen, in substantially their
present form from pre-Mosaic days. Thus the appearances of
God in Gen. 18-19 are to be explained from pre-Mosaic poly



202 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
theism, though the narratives have been revised in such a way as not to offend later Israelite, or for that matter Jewish or Christian readers.
Secondly, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the
anthropomorphic conception of Yahweh was absolutely neces
sary if the God of Israel was to remain a God of the individual Israelite as well as of the people as a whole. For the limited
few who are natural mystics or have learned to employ certain
methods to attain ecstatic state, the theological concepts attached
to deity matter relatively little; there is a striking parallelism between the psychology of mysticism in Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. For the average worshipper, however,
it is very essential that his god be a divinity who can sympathize
with his human feelings and emotions, a being whom he can
love and fear alternately, and to whom he can transfer the holiest emotions connected with memories of father and mother
and friend. In other words, it was precisely the anthropo
morphism of Yahweh which was essential to the initial success
of Israel's religion. Like man at his noblest the God of Israel
might be in form and affective reactions, but there was in Him
none of the human frailties that make the Olympian deities of
Greece such charming poetic! figures and such unedifying ex
amples. All the human characteristics of Israel's deity were
exalted; they were projected against a cosmic screen and they served to interpret the cosmic process as the expression of God's
creative; word and eternally active will. Equally vital to Mosaic religion was the aniconic character
of Yahweh, who could not be represented in any visual or
tangible form. In spite of the unanimous testimony of Israelite
tradition, scholars have made repeated efforts to prove the
existence of representations of deity in early Israel. Every effort
of this kind has been based on subjective arguments and on
arbitrary assumptions which have won only the most limited
acceptance even inj friendly circles.91 Of course, it would be
equally unscholarly to deny the possibility of such images or
portrayals in material form. But the testimony of our written
sources, plus the completely negative results of excavation,
should be evidence enough to prove that Yahwism was essen
tially aniconic and that material representations were foreign



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 203
to its spirit from the beginning. We shall show below that
there is no basis whatever for the idea that Yahweh was worshipped in bull form by the northern tribes at Bethel and Dan.
The golden calf simply formed the pedestal on which the
invisible Yahweh stood, just as in the Temple of Solomon the
invisible Glory of God was enthroned above the cherubim;
conceptually the two ideas are virtually identical. After the demonstration by R. Hartmann and especially by
H. Lammens of nomadic Arab parallels to the portable Taber
nacle and Ark of the Covenant, some of them going far back
into pre-Islamic times,9- it is captious to refuse them Mosaic
date, since they were completely foreign to sedentary Canaanite
practice and since they are known to have persisted for some
time after the Conquest of Palestine. The archaeologist no
longer has any difficulty in proving the antiquity of many details
in the description which is given in the Priestly Code. The uniform testimony of our sources with respect to the
existence of some kind of sacrificial ritual in earliest Israel can
hardly be erroneous, though the constant reaction of the prophets
against the formalism and externality of sacrificial cult hardly suggests that undue emphasis was laid upon it in the Mosaic
system. The sacrifice of domesticated animals, such as cattle,
sheep, goats, and doves, goes back to hoary antiquity and was
common to all Western-Asiatic religions from the third millennium B. C. on down; it might thus have passed into Israelite religion in the Mosaic period or later, with numerous other elements borrowed from the sedentary peoples of Palestine.
However the part played by animal sacrifice in Semitic religion was so vital that it may be doubted whether Moses could have
omitted it from his system without seriously weakening its
appeal to worshippers. Among the Semites of antiquity sacri
fice was a means of bringing gifts to the deity and of paying
him homage which was valid both for a single worshipper and for a group; it served to solemnize every important occasion
in the life of a group; and as shown by Bertholet it brought
the deity into dynamistic relationship to his worshippers, who
became united in flesh and spirit with him by jointly partaking of the sacrificial flesh. Both the substitutional sacrifice, where
an animal replaced a more primitive human sacrifice, and the



204 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
ceremony of the scape-goat (found also in related form in
Mesopotamia) emphasized a vital religious concept, that of
vicarious atonement for moral transgressions which would
otherwise have to be physically expiated by the people. The problem of the origin of the ethical, civil, and ceremonial
laws attributed in later Israel to Moses has been profoundly affected by the appearance of A, Alt's monograph, Die Ur
spriinge des israelitischen Recbts (1934) . In this epochal study
the gifted Leipzig scholar has distinguished sharply between
two main types of pentateuchal legislation: apodictic law and
casuistic law. The latter is found primarily in the Book of the
Covenant (Ex. 21-23), which is a fragmentary legal code of
the same class as the Code of Hammurabi (cir. 1750 B. C),
the Hittite Laws (cir. 14th century B. C.) and the Assyrian
laws (12th century B. C.).
93 All these codes go back in their basic formulation (provided that . . . then) to the Sumerian
jurisprudence of the third millennium (cf. above, p. 148). The Book of the Covenant represents the form which the more
or-less common corpus of older customary laws and court decisions took under the special conditions existing in Canaan,
and it probably passed into Israelite hands during the period
of the Judges. In the form which it takes in the Book of the
Covenant it can hardly be dated before the ninth century. How
ever, it is unlikely that the ninth-century form differed appre
ciably from its Canaanite prototype many centuries earlier, in view of numerous archaisms in practice and terminology which
have older Mesopotamian parallels.
94 The formulation and
spirit of the apodictic laws are unique and original in Israel;
those of the casuistic laws are at home throughout Western
Asia. Besides the Ten Commandments, which best illustrate
the spirit of the apodictic laws, we have many other examples,
such as the old list of curses imbedded in Deut. 27 and mis
cellaneous warnings that certain sins must be punished by
death, in different parts of the Pentateuch. The most striking
thing about the apodictic laws is their categorical character, which stands in sharp contrast to their nearest extra-Israelite
parallels, the Egyptian Negative Confession and the Babylonian
Shurpu; the Israelites are commanded not to commit sin, because
Yahweh so wills.



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 205
Of course, we cannot say how many of the apodictic laws
actually emanate directly from Moses, but the fact that they cannot be paralleled in this form outside of Israel and that they were believed by different schools of traditional thought in Israel to go back to the time of Moses is sufficient indication that they are in accord with the movement which bears his
name. Again we must stress the fact that oral transmission of
tradition is inherently more consistent and logical in its results
than written transmission, since it sifts and refines, modifying whatever does not fit into the spirit of the main body of tradi
tion (cf. above, p. 37). In general it subjects detail to mass
scrutiny instead of to the examination of a few who may be
mentally superior but who are bound to deviate more frequently
from accepted standards. The apodictic law of Israel was not so refined nor so all-inclusive as the Negative Confession of the Egyptians about 1500 B. C, nor did it lay so much stress
on social solidarity as the Babylonian Sburpu of somewhat
later date; on the other hand, it reflects a much more advanced standard of conduct in many respects. Vicious religious cus
toms, such as child sacrifice, necromancy, and sodomy (which
formed part of certain religious ceremonies in the ancient Near
East), are forbidden; work on the sabbath, which endangered
the physical and mental health of workers (as we know from
the recent experience of occidental nations), was prohibited;
95
the worship of all gods save Yahweh and the careless use of
His name were banned. As Alt has pointed out, there is nothing in this legislation that conflicts with conditions in Israel
under Moses. In this respect it is very different from the Book
of the Covenant, which presupposes organized sedentary so
ciety. As he has shown, an independent and very important
testimony to the antiquity of the apodictic code is provided by the fact that it was annually recited in connection with the Feast of Tabernacles at Shechem. Having sketched the certain or probable content of the
Mosaic system, let us consider possible sources of its teaching.
That it was a true "
teaching
"
(doctrina, in the empirical, not in the philosophical sense, of course) may be considered as
virtually certain, in view of its traditional name toYab, its tra
ditional content, and the fact that the slightly earlier system of



206 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Akhenaten was also known as the "teaching" (sbayet).** Since Moses bore an Egyptian name and according to tradition
had reached' a place of considerable social importance in Egypt in his early life, his original torah may well have contained
Egyptian elements which later disappeared before the impact
of native Hebrew conceptions. Some of these elements seem
still to persist, though we cannot be absolutely sure of any one
case, owing to the absence of direct documentation or of com
plex borrowings from Egyptian sources. Among such possible
Egyptian influences may be mentioned: 1. The concept of the
god who is sole creator of everything and the formula from
which his name, Yahweb, was derived (cf. Amun-Ree and his
litany in the New Empire) ; 2. The concept of a single god
and the establishment of a doctrine based on monotheism (cf.
the Aten) ; 3. Recognition of the necessarily international, cosmic dominion of the reigning deity (cf. Sutekh-Baal under
the early Ramessides) . On the negative side it is clear that the
religion of Israel revolted against virtually every external aspect
of Egyptian religion, including the complex and grotesque iconography, the dominion of daily life in the Nineteenth Dynasty
by magic, the materialistic absorption in preparing for a selfish existence in the hereafter.
Turning to assess the influence exerted by native Hebrew
religion on Moses, we are faced with the difficulty of determining just what the latter accepted and what was introduced
into Yahwism after his death from the older Hebrew stock.
Leaving the second alternative aside for the moment, since it has been partly stressed above and will be emphasized again
in other respects below, we can distinguish a number of clear
Hebrew factors and they are what gave Yahwism much of its vital power over the hearts and minds of Israel: 1. The
close association between god and worshipper (s), illustrated
by the giving of personal names and by sacrificial rites; 2. The contractual relationship between the deity of a tribe and his
people, as illustrated by the constant use of the word berith,
"
covenant," in early Israel (specific forms of this contractual
relationship may be later) ; 3. The association of terrestrial manifestations of deity with storms and mountains, and the
identification of Yahweh with Shaddai, "The One of the



WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD ... 207
Mountain (s)"; the adoption of the stories of the Fathers as
part of Israel's inheritance, and the identification of Yahweh
with the God of the Fathers; specific appellations of deity and
perhaps the nucleus of the cosmogony of Genesis, though the
latter may again have been developed later from the native
stock of myths and legends.
There is no clear trace of any West-Semitic influence of
characteristically Canaanite type on the earliest religion of
Israel. After the occupation of Palestine, however, this influ
ence became more and more significant, as we shall see below.
How remote early Hebrew tradition was from Canaanite influences may be illustrated by the total absence from it of any
story of the conflict between the creator and the dragon at the
beginning of world-history. After the seventh century B. C.
we find such references becoming more and more frequent and
the myth of the victory of Yahweh over Leviathan ultimately
obtained wide popularity in rabbinic literature.97
In bringing this chapter to a close we have yet one question
to answer: Was Moses a true monotheist? If by " monotheist "
is meant a thinker with views specifically like those of Philo
Judaeus or Rabbi Aqiba, of St. Paul or St. Augustine, of
Mohammed or Maimonides, of St. Thomas or Calvin, of Mordecai Kaplan or H. N. Wieman, Moses was not one. If,
on the other hand, the term "monotheist" means one who teaches the existence of only one God, the creator of every
thing, the source of justice, who is equally powerful in Egypt,
in the desert, and in Palestine, who has no sexuality and no
mythology, who is human in form but cannot be seen by human
eye and cannot be represented in any form then the founder
of Yahwism was certainly a monotheist.98



CHAPTER V
CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS
Our documentary sources for the history of Israel from the late thirteenth to the early fourth century B. C. are, in general,
remarkably reliable. Among them are first-hand memoirs,
written down by the author himself or an amanuensis, such as
the Book of Nehemiah and part of the Book of Jeremiah. They also include the priceless historical account of the last
years of David (II Sam. 9-20, 1 Kings 1-2), which cannot have
been written down later than the reign of Solomon. Most of
the matter in Kings is singularly accurate from the standpoint
of the modern historian, as has been shown by repeated archaeo
logical and epigraphic discoveries: e.g., Hezekiah's tribute,
II Kings 18: 14, amounts to 30 talents of gold and 300 of silver
in the Hebrew text, whereas the cuneiform inscriptions of Sennacherib list the amount as 30 talents of gold and 800
talents of silver, which is almost certainly exaggerated. This is not the only passage where Kings is more accurate than
contemporary cuneiform records. The work of the Chronicler
contains some matter of pre-exilic documentary origin which is not in Kings; this additional matter was formerly discounted
by historians, but it has repeatedly been shown to be original and important (especially by A. Alt and members of his
school). The post-exilic matter in Chronicles and Ezra
Nehemiah has been regarded by a number of scholars (notably
by C. C. Torrey) as largely apocryphal, but recent discoveries
and investigations have strikingly discredited this extreme posi
tion and have shown that E.. Meyer's brilliant defense of its
authenticity in 1897 was not only fully justified as far as it went
but was not even sufficiently comprehensive. Besides these documents and records of written origin there
is much traditional matter, some of which may have been orally transmitted for several centuries before being reduced to writ
ing. To this category belong most perhaps all of the narra
tives of Joshua and Judges, much in Samuel, especially in the first part of the book, such material as the Elijah-Elisha pericope
in Kings, and most of the matter contained in the prophetic
208



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 209
books. Some of this has probably been handed down with
exemplary accuracy, as may safely be inferred in the case of
the Song of Deborah and of most original poetic oracles and sermons in such books as Amos, Hosea, Isaiah. In these cases the poetic form of the document ensured its reasonably correct
transmission by word of mouth for generations and even for
centuries (see Chapter I) . M. Noth and K. Mohlenbrink have
recently made a vigorous attack on the historical reliability of the stories of the Conquest in Joshua, on various literary and
aetiological grounds, but they have been opposed with equal vigor by the writer (1939) ;
x
archaeological discoveries of the
past few years have proved that their attack far overshoots
the mark (see above, pp. 38 ff., for our criticism of the aetio
logical method when it is not supported by external evidence) .
The stories in Judges contain matter of very different historical value, ranging from the high level of the Gideon and Abimelech narratives (Jud. 6-9) to the low level of the pericope of
Samson, which is nearly pure folklore. Many of the stories in
Joshua and Judges were certainly handed down as poetic sagas
or triumphal poems; 2 the best examples are the accounts of the battle of Gibeon (Jos. 10) and of the Kishon in Jud. 4-5
where the same events are described in both verse and prose.
In their present form the Books of Joshua and Judges clearly belong to the seventh century B. C. (cf. Jud. 18: 30), but some of their contents must have been put into writing as early as
the tenth century.
As is increasingly recognized by competent scholars, most of
the prophetic books may more correctly be called "
anthologies of oracles and sermons," since their contents are seldom in correct chronological order. In other words, oracles and sermons
attributed by common consent to a given prophet circulated
under his name for many years sometimes perhaps for genera
tions and were then gathered from miscellaneous sources,
written and oral, by later collectors, much as was true of the
first edition of the Qur'an, over a millennium later. As already
noted, Jeremiah is in part an exception, though even here some
of the material in the last chapters was evidently collected later
and may contain wrongly attributed poems. The most re
markable case of erroneous attribution is Isaiah, which contains



210 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
at least one, perhaps two, and possibly three bodies of poems
from the exilic age or even in part later (Isa. 40 ff., and a number of preceding chapters). In most cases, thanks to historical
and other allusions, it is relatively easy to distinguish oracles which fit into the original prophet's environment from those
which do not. Our greatest difficulty in interpreting the Prophets is not the fact that extraneous material has been
included in their anthologies but the fact that the Hebrew text
is often in such a hopeless state of preservation that nothing
can be made of it without highly subjective emendation. Sometimes the Greek translation enables us to correct the Hebrew, but more often it fails us and we must be content to allow the text to remain unintelligible. It is unfortunate that commentators have so often tried to explain all difficulties instead of
limiting their exposition to passages whose sense is clear.
A. THE CHARISMATIC AGE OF ISRAEL
According to the standard tradition in the Book of Joshua
Palestine was occupied by the Israelites in the following stages:
Gilead and Bashan in Transjordan (before Moses's death), south-central Palestine, southern Palestine, northern Palestine
(all under Joshua's leadership) . Careful analysis of the narratives in Joshua by Alt and his pupils, applying the methods of Gunkel (p. 44) has led to some important conclusions with regard to the relative age and literary character of the matter
which they contain, though they have gone much too far in
unwarranted use of the principle of aetiology (see above).
Fortunately, a number of quite independent traditions, dating
in their present form from about the tenth century B. C, are
preserved in Jud. 1, so we can check our standard tradition from several directions. It follows, for example, that the role of Joshua has been expanded by tradition and that he had less
to do with the conquest of Judah and Galilee than would appear from superficial reading of the narratives of the book which bears his name. However, the school of Alt is not justi
fied in considering Joshua as only an insignificant local chieftain, nor in denying the historicity of Israelite traditions of the Conquest, just because various minor modifications must cer
tainly be made (e. g., in the stories of Jericho and Ai) and



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 211
still others may have to be introduced into the traditional
picture.
A very important addition may be made to the records in
Joshua and Judges 1 from other biblical sources. In Joshua there is a remarkable reticence with reference to the conquest of north-central Palestine, about which nothing is said except in the list of conquered towns in Ch. 12. In Gen. 34, 48: 22, I Chron. 7: 20 ff. (cir. 400 B. C), Jubilees 34 (cir. third cen
tury B. C.),
8 and elsewhere in still later sources there are allusions to, as well as circumstantial accounts of, the wars of the sons of Jacob in central Palestine, which must rest in part on
very old tradition, though the post-biblical narratives are pre
sumably full of legendary details.4 In all these sources the conquest of central Palestine is referred back to the late
Patriarchal Age. With this agrees, as has been recognized, the
curious silence of the Amarna Tablets about towns in central
Palestine, especially as contrasted with the many references to
places in the south and north. It follows that not all the
Hebrews from whom later Israel sprang, had participated in the Exodus under Moses; some of them must have occupied and have settled certain parts of Palestine before the Israelite invasion under Moses and Joshua. Judging from the references
in the Amarna Tablets to the Khapiru, it is very likely that the latter, then in intermittent conflict with the Canaanite princes
of the hill-country, represent a pre-Israelite phase of the Hebrew
occupation of Palestine. 5 With this would agree an Egyptian reference, from a stela of Sethos I found at Beth-shan (cir. 1310 B. C.) , to the e
Apiru of a mountain district with a Semitic
name. 6 Both from the results of archaeological surveys and
from early records we know that the Canaanite occupation was heavily concentrated in the plains and the low hill-country of
Western Palestine, and that much of the higher hill-country of both Western and Eastern Palestine was not occupied at all by
a sedentary population until about the beginning of the Iron Age, in the twelfth century B. C. It was, therefore, in these
regions where the Hebrews first settled down in late patriarchal times and where they were first joined by the Israelites proper in the thirteenth century.
The Israelites, however, proceeded without loss of time to



212 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
destroy and occupy Canaanite towns all over the country.
7
Bethel may have been one of the first to fall, as might be ex
pected from its exposed situation; it was taken at some time in
the thirteenth century B. C. and burned to the ground, as shown
by the indications of an unusually devastating conflagration which were found in the excavation of 1934. Lachish fell about
1230 B. C. or a little later, as is proved by a hieratic inscription on a bowl which was found in 1937 in the debris of the de
struction of the latest Canaanite city. Kirjath-sepher (if cor
rectly identified with Tell Beit Mirsim) was destroyed by fire
about the same time. The Egyptians themselves were greatly impressed by the Israelite advance, which they took ineffectual
measures to check, as we may infer from a couplet in the
triumphal poem of Marniptah, dated 1229 B. C.:
The people Israel is desolate, it has no offspring;
Palestine has become a widow for Egypt!
Archaeological excavation and exploration are throwing increasing light on the character of the earliest Israelite occupation, about 1200 B. C. First it is important to note that the
new inhabitants settled in towns like Bethel and Tell Beit Mirsim almost immediately after their destruction. The Israelites were thus far from being characteristic nomads or even semi
nomads, but were ready to settle down at once and live the life
of peasants, tilling the soil and dwelling in stone houses. A
second main point is that the new Israelite occupation was
incomparably more intensive than was the preceding Canaanite
one. All over the hill-country we find remains of Iron-Age (12th century ) villages which had not been inhabited in the Late Bronze Age (I5th-13th centuries) and which had often
never been occupied at all previously. Thanks to the rapidly increasing diffusion of cisterns, which were lined with true lime
plaster (previously not used) , the area of settlement was vastly
extended and the Israelites began cutting down forests and
settling in previously inaccessible districts (cf. Jos. 17: 15).
The population of early Israelite Palestine was mainly com
posed of three groups: pre-Israelite Hebrews, Israelites proper,
and Canaanites of miscellaneous origin. The Hebrews coalesced
so rapidly with their Israelite kindred that hardly any references



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 213
to this distinction have survived in biblical literature and the few apparent allusions are doubtful The Canaanites were
brought into the Israelite fold by treaty, conquest, or gradual
absorption. The four towns of the Gibeonite confederacy were
added to Israel by treaty, according to explicit tradition; the
Bene Hamor (Sons of the Ass) of Shechem were also incor
porated in some such way, to judge from various early refer
ences to them and to their god Baal-berith (Lord of the Cove
nant note that the sacrifice of an ass was an essential feature of a treaty among the Amorites of the Mari period) . Several
towns appear both as autonomous Canaanite cities and as names
of " clans " in the tribal genealogies: Shechem, Hepher, Tirzah,
perhaps Zaphon, etc. The standard tradition correctly empha
sizes the part played by the herem (devotion to death) in the
Israelite Conquest. The practice of devoting a recalcitrant foe to destruction as a kind of gigantic holocaust to the national deity was apparently universal among the early Semites. In the
Mesha Stone, from the ninth century B. C, a Moabite king
describes how he massacred all the Israelite population of
Ataroth as "satisfaction for the blood-lust" of Chemosh and
Moab. In the same inscription he says, "I captured (Nebo)
and killed everybody, seven thousand men, boys, women, girls,
and maidens, because I had devoted it to (the god) Ashtar
Chemosh." Strictly speaking this Semitic custom was no worse, from the humanitarian point of view, than the reciprocal massacres of Protestants and Catholics in the seventeenth century (e.g., Magdeburg, Drogheda), or than the massacre of Armenians
by Turks and of Kirghiz by Russians during the First World War, or than the recent slaughter of non-combatants in Spain
by both sides. It is questionable whether a strictly detached
observer would consider it as bad as the starvation of helpless Germany after the armistice in 1918 or* the bombing of Rotter
dam in 1940. In those days warfare was total, just as it is again
becoming after the lapse of over three millennia. And we
Americans have perhaps less right than most modern nations,
in spite of our genuine humanitarianism, to sit in judgment on
the Israelites of the thirteenth century B. C., since we have, intentionally or otherwise, exterminated scores of thousands of
15



214 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Indians in every corner of our great nation and have crowded
the rest into great concentration camps. The fact that this was
probably inevitable does not make it more edifying to the
Americans of today. It is significant that after the first phase
of the Israelite Conquest we hear no more about "
devoting
"
the population of Canaanite towns, but only of driving them
out or putting them to tribute (Jud. 1, passim). From the
impartial standpoint of a philosopher of history, it often seems necessary that a people of markedly inferior type should vanish
before a people of superior potentialities, since there is a point
beyond which racial mixture cannot go without disaster. When such a process takes place as at present in Australia there is generally little that can be done by the humanitarian though
every deed of brutality and injustice is infallibly visited upon
the aggressor. It was fortunate for the future of monotheism that the Israelites of the Conquest were a wild folk, endowed with
primitive energy and ruthless will to exist, since the resulting decimation of the Canaanites prevented the complete fusion
of the two kindred folk which would almost inevitably have depressed Yahwistic standards to a point where recovery was
impossible. Thus the Canaanites, with their orgiastic nature
worship, their cult of fertility in the form of serpent symbols and sensuous nudity, and their gross mythology, were replaced
by Israel, with its nomadic simplicity and purity of life, its lofty monotheism, and its severe code of ethics. In a not altogether dissimilar way, a millennium later, the African Canaanites, as
they still called themselves, or the Carthaginians, as we call
them, with the gross Phoenician mythology which we know
from Ugarit and Philo Byblius, with human sacrifices and the
cult of sex, were crushed by the immensely superior Romans,
whose stern code of morals and singularly elevated paganism
remind us in many ways of early Israel.
The social and political system of the new nation was ex
ceedingly simple. Socially, it was divided into a number of clan-groups which are known to us as "tribes"; in Hebrew
two designations are employed, both meaning "staff." The number and identity of these tribes vary somewhat in our lists; in theory there were twelve of them, whose organization went



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 215
back to Moses and Joshua. Tradition uniformly emphasizes both the religious character of the bond between die tribes and the existence of a central sanctuary at Shiloh, to which the
tribes could send representatives (Josh. 18: 1, 21: 2, Jud. 21: 12, I Sam. 1-4, Jer. 7: 12 and passim). A. Alt and his pupils have
correctly stressed the amphictyonic nature of this system, which
has a number of extraordinarily close parallels in the Mediterranean basin during the early centuries of the first millennium
B. C 8 When we add the force of this analogy to the consistent Israelite tradition, the soundness of the latter becomes evident. As a matter of fact, the only reason why the school of Well
hausen has consistently disregarded or even rejected the straightforward biblical account of the central Tabernacle at Shiloh is
that it does not fit into the postulated, but never demonstrated,
theory of progressive centralization of cult. Here we may safely
trust to our documents and assume an oscillatory movement
rather than unilateral evolution. The Tabernacle and the Ark
were under the charge of the Levitic priesthood, who perpetuated their Egyptian traditions as late as the early eleventh
century, when the two sons of Eli are called Hophni and
Phinehas, both Egyptian names. At the head of the priesthood stood the chief priest, called in our earliest sources simply
" the priest," since early Israel seems to have consistently eschewed
honorific titles. That he was de facto head of the priestly system is obvious from the narratives where he is mentioned, and any other organization would hardly have been workable.
Moreover, we know from the inscriptions of Ugarit that the
head of the local priesthood was called rabbit kahimma, " chief
of the priests," as early as the 14th century B. C.9
It is not, however, correct to speak of Israel in the premonarchic age as a theocratic state in the sense that the head
of the religious organization was also head of the state, as was to be true for a timej in the fourth and third centuries B. C. The Israelites were too fond of freedom and too particularistic
to follow a typical priestly leader and only the exceptional head of a priestly system can also become the leader of his
people in war and peace. Our traditions credit only two of the
early chief priests with being military leaders. Nor did the
tribal head or nas? have any real power beyond his tribe. It is



216 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
significant that none of the early narratives mentions a na$V\ it is only in the administrative lists which are incorporated
into the Priestly Code and the Book of Chronicles that we find
any reference to tribal chieftains.10 The tribes were too jealous of their prerogatives to submit under normal conditions to the
head of another tribe, even briefly. Neither Gideon nor Abimelech was able to extend his political power beyond the bounds of his native tribe of Manasseh. Yet there had to be leaders whose direction would be ac
cepted by Israel m times of crisis or danger, and there had to
be magistrates whose decision in civil cases would provide a
court of appeal for tribesmen who felt themselves oppressed.
And leaders arose, heads of clans like Othniel, military leaders
of humbler origin like Ehud, Barak, and Gideon, men of wealth like Jair, Ibzan, and Abdon, bastard adventurers like Jephthah,
priests like Eli, prophets like Samuel, and even Canaanite
chieftains like Shamgar of Beth-anath (cf. Jud. 5: 6) ,n Among
them later narrators included such semi-legendary figures as
the strong man, Samson, and the woman Deborah (cf. Jud. 4: 5 with Gen. 35: 8), but their inclusion helps materially to
explain the nature of the " office." Max Weber, followed by A. Alt, has happily applied the term "charismatic" to the
Israelite leaders of the time of the Judges. The "
judges
" were
respected and followed, regardless of tribal affiliations, because there was some special power about them which was believed
to represent the direct outpouring of divine grace (charisma) .
A popular military hero was most likely to be considered as a
charismatic "judge," but a man renowned for his wisdom and
- justice might also be placed on a level with the hero, as far as
recognition of his divinely granted superiority went. The name shophet,
"
judge," is an old Canaanite word, found later among
the Carthaginians in the sense of "magistrate, civic leader" (suffete) ; it must have developed the charismatic sense somewhat as follows: Local personages became distinguished far
and wide for their wisdom and their honesty, and men came to
them from increasing distances for adjudication of disputes.
But a judge had to have a measure of special divine favor in
order to employ the trial by ordeal, which was discontinued in
later Israel but which undoubtedly played an important part



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 217
in earlier times (c. the story o Gideon) . Hence his fame for
wisdom and honesty was supplemented by a reputation as a
special agent of divine power. The judge Samuel was even considered a diviner (seer) . Samson was a Nazirite from birth,
i. e., he was dedicated by special rites and ascetic practices to
a life of exceptional austerity. Since Samson's character other
wise belies this tradition, it presumably illustrates the common attitude toward the charismatic leader rather than any phase of the hero's life.
A. Alt has effectively directed attention to the possible signifi
cance of the institution of "
judges
"
(especially as seen in the
Minor Judges) as a channel through which the casuistic law
of the Canaanites, best known from the fragments preserved
in the Book of the Covenant (see above, p. 204), reached
Israel.12 As will be recalled, this law is much older than the time of the Judges and goes back in its ultimate formulation to Sumerian jurisprudence. During the second millennium it
developed in various ways in different countries, through the constant reciprocal influence of legal codes and bodies of cus
tomary law, altered from time to time by the addition of new
court decisions or the impact of some entirely new social,
cultural, or religious situation. Since Israelite culture was in many respects a tabula rasa
when the Israelites invaded Palestine, we might expect them to have been influenced strongly by the culture of their Canaanite
predecessors. Yet excavations show a most abrupt break be
tween the culture of the Canaanite Late Bronze Age and that
of the Israelite Early Iron Age in the hill-country of Palestine.
Early Israelite strata show no signs of the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few; the palaces of
Canaanite towns are replaced by large and small rustic enclosures and huts. Massive Canaanite fortifications are replaced
by thin walls of the new casemate type. The corvee was
obviously unknown in Israel at that time, except when imposed,
briefly by foreign conquerors. The word which means " feudal serf" in Canaanite documents (Amarna, Ugarit, etc.) comes
to signify "freeman" (hopbshi}, presumably because the
peasant, to whom the word was commonly applied, had ceased
to be a Canaanite serf and had become a freeborn Israelite.18



218 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Passing over other illustrations of the cultural relation between Canaanites and Israelites and of the effect of the impact
of the two peoples upon the latter, let us turn to the field
of religion which interests us particularly here. Owing to lack
of specific data for the time of the Judges, we shall postpone consideration of the cultic aspect of Canaanite-Israelite religious
syncretism until we reach the Monarchy, However, it is quite possible to gain an approximate idea of the influence of the
cult of Baal upon Yahwism as a religion during the age of the
Judges. The proportion of names formed with " Baal" seems
to increase rather steadily as we approach the end of the period,
since there are no examples from the time of the Exodus or
the Wanderings, and the number becomes considerable at the time of Saul and David. Furthermore, there is a detailed account of the conflict between Yahwism and Baalism in the story
of Gideon, whose father, Joash (with a Yahwistic name) called
his son Jerub-baal and erected an altar to Baal. The home of Gideon, Ophrah of Abiezer, has never been located with cer
tainty, but all hypotheses place it in districts on the periphery
of Manasseh, i. e., in territory which had probably been Hebrew
even before the Conquest, and had remained peculiarly exposed
to Canaanite influence.14 Since Yahweh and Baal were both lords of heaven and senders of rain, were both storm-gods and
givers of fertility, it is only natural that they should have been
assimilated, especially in northern Israel where the pagan
pre-Mosaic religion of the land remained dormant, constantly
awaking and impelling men to adapt elements of Baalism to
the worship of Yahweh. While we have no certain knowledge, it is only reasonable to suppose that the Levites were most
active in maintaining the claims of Yahwism against Baal, or
rather in defending Yahweh-Baal (Lord Yahweh) against the
Canaanite Baal. As we shall see below, the invasion of the Tyrian Baal and his votaries in the ninth century led to a violent
reaction against the whole dangerous practice of applying the
title "Baal" to Yahweh. Meanwhile the constant struggle between the Israelites and
the surrounding peoples was slowly but surely hammering them
into national unity. Hardly had they conquered most of the Canaanite towns of the hill-country than they were exposed to



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 219
new enemies of greater vigor and potential menace. In the first
quarter of the twelfth century came the Philistines and the
Tsikal from the regions of the Aegean, bringing a rude barbaric
energy from the north as well as exotic culture of Mycenaean
type. Before the end of the century they were menacing Israel
seriously, and about 1050 B. C. they defeated the Israelites in a great battle in the Plain of Sharon and destroyed Shiloh and
its Tabernacle, taking the Ark of the Covenant into captivity.
About the same time 15 came a never-forgotten irruption of the
Midianites, who had learned how to use the recently domesti
cated camel with terrifying effectiveness in long-range raids.16
Then there was intermittent fighting with the Canaanite citystates, with the Moabites and Ammonites on the east, and with Aramaean tribes from the Syrian Desert. Last, but not least,
there was bloody civil strife between tribe and tribe, or between all Israel and a single tribe. As shown by the writer's excava
tions, Bethel was destroyed four times between 1200 and 1000
B. C. One can hardly be surprised if under such conditions
Israel became martially minded and Israel's God became
"Yahweh, God of (the) Hosts (of Israel)/' one of whose
primary functions was to defend His people against foes whose
only aim seemed to be to destroy it utterly and to devote it to
their impure gods. In an early triumphal poem, celebrating the
first victory of Israel over its foes, we read for example (Exod.
15:3,6):
Yahweh is a man of war Yahweh is his name!
Thy right arm, O Yahweh, is majestic in power;
Thy right arm, O Yahweh, shatters the foe!
In the couplet just quoted is found the Canaanite poetical
device in which two successive lines of verse have the scheme
abc-abd, which has been shown by H. L. Ginsberg (1935) to be characteristic of Ugaritic poetry.
17 Yahweh here replaces
"Baal" of the Canaanite prototype. The same device also occurs repeatedly in the Song of Deborah, though subordinated
there to the device of climactic parallelism, which has not yet
been identified in Ugaritic literature. It is highly improbable that dominant circles in Israel were



220 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
"henotheistic" in the time of the Judges, since the spirit of
Moses and his influence were still alive and victories over the
Canaanites were too recent and too impressive to permit them to subordinate Yahweh to the Canaanite cosmic lord of heaven,
especially since the latter was worshipped all over the Semitic
Near East. Moreover, we see from the Song of Deborah that
Yahweh was believed to be particularly at home in regions which were definitely outside of Israelite control and far beyond the immediate purview of the northern tribes. The ignorant or
moronic are often polytheists or henotheists in an age of mono
theism, as every experienced priest or pastor or orthodox rabbi
knows. Many backward Catholics are polytheists, many ignorant
Protestants are tritheists, and moronic Jews express henotheistic
ideas. The parade example of early Israelite henotheism is
singularly weak. In a speech to the king of the Ammonites
Jephthah is represented as saying (Jud. 11:24), "Wilt thou not possess what Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess?'*
It is generally recognized that this speech, which cannot be older than JE, was originally addressed to a king of the
Moabites; in any event it probably belongs to the seventh century and cannot be older than the eighth century B. C. It does
not, therefore, in any case prove henotheism in the time of the
Judges. However, it is quite unnecessary to suppose that it proves henotheism at any period, since the objectivity of the approach ad hominem is entirely characteristic of Hebrew
thought and literature before the Exile. Patriarchs, national
heroes, and religious leaders are described with the most im
partial portrayal of faults and sins as well as of virtues. Israel's
defeats are mentioned as often as are her triumphs. When the
Egyptians speak of the Israelites they call them "Hebrews,"
not " Israelites." When Israelites address foreigners they use
language suitable to their horizon and capable of producing a
friendly reaction. There is nothing "modern" about this
principle, which must have been a commonplace in the ancient
Orient though no other known people of antiquity can approach the objectivity of the Israelites in such matters, to judge
from their literature.



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 221
B. THE UNITED MONARCHY AND THE BEGINNINGS OF THE PROPHETIC MOVEMENT
As A. Alt has pointed out, there was a striking difference
in political organization between the various peoples in Pales
tine and southern Syria in the eleventh century B. C18 While the Israelites maintained their loose confederation on the
amphictyonic principle, depending for guidance on spontaneously arising leadership, the surrounding nations were all
highly organized. Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites all had
kings who were much more than tribal emirs, as we know from such monuments as the Balu'ah stela of the twelfth century and
the Mesha Stone of the ninth, which confirm and illustrate the
biblical data. The Philistines had their seramm, "
lords," who seem to have been tyrants after the Aegean model. The Canaanites of Phoenicia were still organized in city-states ac
cording to the Bronze-Age prototype, but freedom from foreign
domination and the great expansion of their commerce in the
Early Iron Age had made Tyre, Sidon and Byblus powerful nations with authority centralized in the hands of the king, as
we know from Egyptian and biblical sources, supplemented
by native inscriptions. No help against these potent adversaries
could be expected from the ancient empires of the Near East Egypt had ceased to maintain effective rule in Asia after the
reign of Ramesses III (1195-1164 B. C), though half-hearted
efforts were made by several of his ephemeral successors, down
to about 1150, to support Egyptian garrisons. The Assyrian
Empire, after controlling Mesopotamia as far west as the
Euphrates for over two centuries (cir. 1300-1100 B. C.) had,
under Tiglath-pileser I (1113-1074 B. C.), conquered northern
Syria and made the Phoenician states briefly tributary, but his successors were too weak to maintain the supremacy of Assyria
over Syria, and the Assyrian border was kept in the Euphrates
Valley.
The advance of the Philistines after the destruction of Shiloh (an event known from the Danish excavations there) threat
ened to reduce Israel to hopeless servitude, and the Philistines
neglected no effort to assure their domination, if we may judge by their ruthless control of the manufacture of iron tools and



222 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
weapons (I Sam. 13: 19-21) . Iron was just coming into general
use in Palestine in the eleventh century B. C, as we know from
excavations,19 and the iron monopoly was not only a powerful
aid to Philistine superiority in arms, but also a valuable commercial privilege, as the Hittites had found two centuries previ
ously. The leaders of Israel, in particular the aging Samuel, had no recourse but to find a king, and it can hardly be acci
dental that their choice fell on Saul, who was not only famous for his stature and prowess, but was also a member of die weak
est and most central tribe, that of Benjamin. In a confederacy
where tribal jealousy ran high, it was of great importance that
the new king should not excite particularistic friction from the
start. Though Toynbee seems to have overlooked the case of the
Israelites between 1200 and 900 B. C., it would be difficult to
find a better illustration of his principle of "
Challenge-andResponse under the stimulus of blows/* Under this stimulus the
Israelites attained national unity in spite of the centrifugal forces operating to break up the confederation. Saul (cir. 1020
1000) was unable, it is true, to advance beyond a loose political
confederacy, mainly, as would appear from our sources, because
of innate weakness of character. But his successor, David (cir.
1000-960) who was the last of the great charismatic figures in
Israelite political life, effected a true unity, cementing it by a victory over a palace revolt in the later years of his reign.
David made no attempt, so far as we know, to establish a
centralized state; the needs of his personal and official treasury
were presumably met by the spoils of war and by regular levies from the conquered Canaanites of Esdraelon, Sharon, and
Galilee, from the subjugated Hebrew border-states of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, and from the tributary Philistines and
Aramaeans. The prototype of the census-lists in Numbers prob
ably dates from fails reign (see II Sam. 24) , especially since the
total of about 600,000 suits the demographic requirements for
Israelite population at that time exceedingly well, if we suppose that it originally included both sexes and all ages.
20 His son
Solomon (cir. 960-925) soon found himself in a difficult position, since he undertook a series of most elaborate building
operations throughout the country and also established a power



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 223
ful standing army of chariotry, both of which occur for the first time in the history of Israel. It is true that scholars used to
belittle the tradition preserved in Kings, to say nothing of the
obviously exaggerated form which is given by the Chronicler,
and reduce his building operations to very modest dimensions.
However, archaeological discovery at Megiddo since 1929 has
shown that Solomon's building activities in a single one of his "chariot-cities" (I Kings 9: 15-19, 10: 26) included well
constructed stables with cement floors for at least 400, and perhaps many more horses. At Hazor and Tell el-Hesi similar installations from the Solomonic age have also been found.
Moreover, Nelson Glueck's work at Ezion-geber on the Red Sea since 1938 has demonstrated that Solomon built an elaborate
copper refinery there, covering an acre and a half and surrounded by a strong brick wall. Nothing like it is otherwise
known from the ancient Near East yet it was so relatively
insignificant an enterprise that it is not even mentioned in our
sources. The expense of his extensive and costly building operations and of his relatively huge military establishment was not diminished by his elaborate mercantile and industrial enterprises, such as caravan trade in the desert, naval expeditions in
the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, and copper mining and
refining in the Arabah (of which nothing was known before
Glueck's recent explorations and excavations) . Moreover, the
scale of his personal life appears to have been proverbially lavish. Solomon was, therefore, compelled to resort to the
corvee (I Kings 5: 13 ff.) and to reorganize the fiscal adminis
tration of the entire tribal confederacy, substituting twelve new
districts (I Kings 4: 7 ff.) for the former tribal units and plac
ing royal officers over each one. 21 It is hardly surprising,
therefore, that his death was immediately followed by a general
rebellion of the northern tribes and the Division of the Mon
archy (cir. 925 B.C.). During this period of nearly a century of national unity
Israelite culture must have made progress comparable to the
cultural advance which we see in Egypt from Nebka to Cheops and in Babylonia from Sargon I to Naram-Sin. Israelite life
had remained at a low cultural level during the preceding two centuries, as excavations have conclusively demonstrated. Even



224 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Saul was only a rustic chieftain, as far as architecture and the amenities of life were concerned; a clear idea of his cultural status is given by the writer's excavation of his citadel at
Gibeah. Not a single building nor object from Palestinian soil can yet be attributed with confidence to David; probably the
so-called "
Jebusite
" revetment of the recently excavated city
wall of early Jerusalem dates in part from his time. On the
other hand archaeology is beginning, as we have seen, to shed a vivid light on the cultural achievements of the reign of
Solomon. Moreover, comparative archaeological investigations
can now clarify many details of the construction and decoration
of the Temple and palace of the king, by comparison with
similar remains excavated in other nearly contemporary sites of
Syria and Palestine. The glowing accounts of the Book of
Kings may be slightly over-drawn, but when we compare the
tangible illustrations brought to light by excavations with what
we have from earlier and later Israel, it must be confessed that they are relatively correct.
The advance of material civilization was evidently accom
panied by progress in higher culture, especially in literature.
David was himself a musician and poet of note, according to a
persistent tradition which can hardly be erroneous, since musical and poetic accomplishments were not considered as any
more virile by the ancient Orientals, especially in a warlike age,
than they are today. Solomon is also said to have been a most productive author of verse and gnomic literature. Unhappily
nothing seems to have been directly preserved of this mass of
literary production, so we may possibly infer that it was more
prolific than inspired. Nor must we forget that literary works
had to be extremely good to pass muster in Israel, if we may
judge from the average level of literary composition in the
Bible, even when seen through a text corrupted by many cen
turies of scribal transmission. The remarkable level to which prose literature could aspire under Solomon is shown by the brilliant narrative in II Sam. 9-20, written in flawless classical
Hebrew. Though we may go perhaps a little too far in calling
the age of Solomon " the Golden Age of Hebrew literature/'
it may be affirmed with confidence that during his reign Hebrew
prose took the literary form which remained classical in the



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 225
subsequent history of Judah. That the Hebrew of Solomon's court was the dialect of northern Judah and Benjamin might be
expected from David's own background and history, and appears almost certain after recent epigraphic discoveries in vari
ous parts of Palestine.
In the absence of adequate direct records of Israelite religion
under Solomon, we must draw our conclusions from such sources as the account of the construction and equipment of the
Temple. Here the process of Canaanization appears to reach
a climax. The Temple was not intended primarily to be a
public place of worship for all Israel, but rather, as has been conclusively demonstrated by Alt, Mohlenbrink, and Scott
(1939),22 to be a royal chapel into which the palladium of
Israel was brought as a sign that the worship of Yahweh was
thereafter to be under the special protection of the king. It was built by a Canaanite architect from Tyre, undoubtedly following Phoenician models, since there was none in Israel to follow.
The closest parallels in plan, details of arrangement and furnishing, and nomenclature come from Phoenicia (Cyprus),
Syria, and Mesopotamia. The Temple received a new, Ca
naanite name, hekhal (a word originally borrowed by the
Canaanites from the Sumerians before 2500 B. C, as shown by
A. Poebel). The pillars of Jachin and Boaz, the Sea, the portable lavers, the great altar, the decoration of walls and
objects with figures of cherubim (winged sphinxes) , lions, bulls, palmettes and lilies, etc., are all of contemporary Canaanite
inspiration. However, Yahweh Himself remained invisible, enthroned in majesty above the cherubim of the cella, which was
called " the Holy of Holies."
The process of Canaanizing sacrificial practice and ritual
probably began much earlier, and its roots doubtless go back
through Moses to the Patriarchal Age. Yet it is at this time
that it may have reached its culmination, and most of the ritual
preserved in the Priestly Code must reflect the practice of the
Temple of Solomon. R. Dussaud has shown (1921) the close
relation existing between the terminology of tie Priestly Code
and much later Phoenician sacrificial practice, as we know it
from Carthaginian sacrificial tariffs of about the fourth century B. C. 23 Recent discoveries at Beth-shan and especially at Lachish



226 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
(1939) have 'proved that there was even greater similarity between the sacrificial materials of Canaanite cult in the thirteenth century B. C. and those of the Priestly Code than existed
between the latter and the Carthaginian system. This is particularly evident in the extensive use of the right front leg of a
sacrificial animal (which is also characteristic of Mesopotamian
practice) ,
24 On the other hand, there were such far-reaching differences between the Egyptian and the Canaanite-Hebrew
sacrificial systems that any appreciable influence from the for
mer upon the latter is excluded. In this connection it is curious to note that the Egyptians of the late second millennium B. C.
borrowed the practice of offering holocausts (burnt offerings),
to which they applied the Canaanite-Hebrew word kalil
(Egyptian chelil) .
25
There is no indication that the Israelite idea of God was
permanently influenced by Canaanite conceptions in this age.
But it is clear that the doctrine of angels began to receive
certain modifications which eventually developed into the elabo
rate Judaeo-Christian angelic hierarchy of Graeco-Roman times. Owing to the difficulty of dating our scattered references pre
cisely, it is hard to define the early Yahwistic conception, but
we may safely infer that it was not very different from what we
find in the Pentateuch (outside of Genesis) and other prose
narratives dating in their present form from the early monarchic
age. The subject is exceedingly complex and obscure, and there
were certainly many diverging tendencies and fluctuations in Israelite thought in different periods and circles. Yahweh was believed to have created astral as well as terrestrial beings, and
the former were popularly called " the host of heaven " or
" the sons of God "
(bene 'El or bent ha-'Elohtm) . This meant simply
"
gods
" in Canaanite, as is clear from numerous pas
sages in Ugaritic literature, illustrated by many parallel Semitic
expressions. In Gen. 6: 1 ff., for example, we have an original
myth in which the (astral) gods had intercourse with mortal
women, who gave birth to heroes (literally, "meteors/'
nephftim), an idea that may often be illustrated from Baby
lonian and Greek mythology.26 But the Israelite who heard this
section recited, unquestionably thought of intercourse between
angels and women (like later Jews and Christians) ; the pas



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 227
sage would presumably have been eliminated by later editors if
it had not been interpreted in some less objectionable way by verbal exegesis.
27 In Job (fifth century B. C.) the expression is
still employed in the sense of "
angels/*
A very interesting and instructive passage, which has been misused, is Deut. 32: 8 f., from the Song of Moses, which
seems to date from the seventh century B. C., where we read (with the Greek translators of the third century B. C.) :
When the Most High gave the nations their heritage,
When He divided mankind,
(Then) He fixed the territories of the peoples
According to the number of the sons of God ; But Yahweh's share was His people,
Jacob was His inherited possession.
The third and fourth hemistichs have been rendered as follows by T. J. Meek (1939),28 in an effort to demonstrate Yahweh's rank below the Most High:
" He assigned the realms
of the nations to the various deities "() What the passage
really means, however, is clear from Job. 38: 7,
When the morning stars rejoiced together
And all the sons of God shouted with joy.
There are many passages in the Old Testament where the stars serve as a simile for "multitude"; specific references to "counting" the stars are found in Gen. 15: 5 and Psalms
147: 4. We must, accordingly, explain the fourth hemistich in the passage quoted from Deut. 32 as meaning simply
" according to the number of the stars," i, e., God created and assigned
abodes to a multitude of different nations, but of them all he chose Israel as his special charge. It may be added that this passage, like a number of others in this poem, is full of
Canaanite literary reminiscences, as we know from Ugaritic
literature, so we need not take any single simile or poetic phrase
too literally. The monotheistic standpoint of the author of Deut. 32 is clear from a number of passages: pagan deities are
" evil spirits
"
(shetttm, v. 17),
" not divine "
(v. 21) ;" I am I
(so !) and there is no God beside Me "
(v. 39) .
29
It is generally recognized by scholars that only part of the
early prose passages which mention "
messengers (angels) of



228 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
God " or " the messenger of Yahweh " reflect their original
sense. In some places, as in the patriarchal narratives (e. g., Gen. 18: 2; 19: 1) , the original pre-Mosaic tradition referred to early Hebrew deities or demigods. In some later passages the
term "
angel of Yahweh " has clearly been substituted for
" Yahweh." In the post-patriarchal period there is remarkable fluctuation: e. g., in Ex. 33 different strands of JE represent Yahweh himself, or his angel, or his Presence (pamm) as going before Israel to guide it through the desert. In this case
it is safe to say that the earliest post-Mosaic version repre
sented Yahweh Himself as leading Israel; the replacement of
God Himself by His messenger is orthodox Israelite doctrine,
but the use of the term " Presence " reminds one strongly of
the late Canaanite (Carthaginian) idea that Tanit was the
"
presence (power) of Baal " (Iemit pene Ba'al) and may have been felt by orthodox Israelite theologians to verge perilously on pagan hypostatizations of deity. At all events it does not seem to appear elsewhere in biblical literature until the seventh
century B.C. (Deut. 4: 37); for later occurrences see below,
p. 267) . It is very clear that standard Israelite thinking in early
pre-exilic times insisted on the ideal anthropomorphic character
of Yahweh, who was a personal God and not an impersonal manifestation of deity. While prophetic theology had not yet
been reduced to "logical" terms, it was undoubtedly acutely conscious of divagations which might lead to disastrous practical results. In other words, it had reached an advanced stage of
empirico-logical development.
C. THE DIVIDED MONARCHY AND THE CHARISMATIC PROPHETS
1
. The Age of the Ecstatic Prophets
The first effect of the Division of the Monarchy (cir. 925
B. C.) was to implement the popular reaction against the process of centralization of government, both in secular and in
religious spheres. In order to weaken the possible appeal of
the Temple of Solomon to Israelites who were moved by the
fact that it contained the Ark of the Covenant and was thus the heir of the Tabernacle at Shiloh, Jeroboam I built two new
sanctuaries of Yahweh at Bethel and Dan. Both of them



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS
claimed to represent the true Levitic priestly tradition o Moses
and Aaron: die ancestor of the later priestly line at Dan was
said to be a certain Jonathan of the family of Gershom, son of
Moses (so with the original Massoretic text, the Alexandrine
Greek, and the Vulgate) ; the priestly line at Bethel is said by
the hostile Deuteronomic editor (I Kings 12: 31) to have been
of non-Levitic origin, which implies that it had claimed falsely
to be Levitic, and the originality of this claim is confirmed by the Ephraimitic tradition in Ex. 32, according to which Aaron
himself made the prototypic golden calf. Moreover, in pre
sumable reaction against the representation of Yahweh in the
Temple of Solomon as an invisible deity enthroned above the
two cherubim (winged sphinxes), which is now known to have
been influenced by contemporary Canaanite inconography
(where kings and gods are shown sitting on thrones supported
by two cherubs), Jeroboam represented Yahweh as an invisible
figure standing on a young bull of gold. It is true that the
" golden calves " have been assumed by most scholars to have
been direct representations of Yahweh as bull-god, but this
gross conception is not only otherwise unparalleled in biblical
tradition, but is contrary to all that we know of Syro-Palestinian iconography in the second and early first millennia B. C.
Among Canaanites, Aramaeans, and Hittites we find the gods
nearly always represented as standing on the back of an animal or as seated on a throne borne by animals but never as themselves in animal form. It is true that the Hurrians considered the two bulls Sheri and Khurri, who supported the throne of
the storm-god Teshub, as minor deities, but they were not identified with the great storm-god! It was, therefore, pointed out
by K. Th. Obbink in 1929 that the "
golden calf " must have
been the visible pedestal on which the invisible Yahweh stood.30
In 1938 the writer showed that no other interpretation can be
squared with the known facts.81 The storm-god of Mesopo
tamia is actually represented on seal-cylinders of the second
millennium B. C. as a schematic bolt of lighting set upright on the back of a bull, and this iconographic device may go back
to Sumerian seals showing the bull who was the central figure
in the ritual of consecration of a sacred drum with the winged
shrine of music (so labelled!) on his back.32 The bull on
16



230 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
which the storm-god stood is sometimes clearly represented as
a bullock of two or three years, just at the prime of life and
vigor, so the term *egel9 which is also applied in biblical Hebrew
to a three-year old animal, is entirely suitable. 33 Conceptually there is, of course, no essential difference between representing the invisible deity as enthroned on the cherubim or as standing
on a bull. We may safely assume, in the light of the conflate
tradition preserved in Ex. 32, which probably has a very early
nucleus, that the pre-Mosaic Hebrews had also been accustomed
to thinking of their chief god, the storm-god Shaddai, as standing on a bull, and the pre-Israelite Hebrews of central Palestine almost certainly shared ideas of this kind with their Canaanite
neighbors, who portrayed Baal in the same way. So Jeroboam may well have been harking back to early Israelite traditional
practice when he made the "
golden calves." It is hardly neces
sary to point out that it was a dangerous revival, since the taurine associations of Baal, lord of heaven, were too closely bound up with the fertility cult in its more insidious aspects to
be safe. The cherubim, being mythical animals, served to en
hance the majesty of Yahweh, " who rides on a cherub "
(II
Sam. 22: 11) or "who thrones on the cherubim" (II Kings
19: 15, etc.), but the young bulls of Bethel and Dan could only debase His cult. Like Solomon Jeroboam took the cult of
Yahweh under his direct protection, and the sanctuary at Bethel
was said by its chief priest to be " a royal chapel and a dynastic temple" (Amos 7: 13).
At this dangerous moment in the history of Yahwism, when
its pristine purity threatened to be violated by the Canaanizing encroachments of temple-cult, in both South and North, came
the prophetic movement like a refreshing west wind, blowing
from the sea and dispersing the stagnant air of the sirocco.
Since the phenomenon of prophetism is of paramount significance for proper understanding of the development of Israelite
religion, we must devote some attention to its nature and history
before analyzing its function in ninth-century Yahwism. It has repeatedly been emphasized since the work of G. Holscher (1914) that the prophetic movement takes root in
group-ecstaticism, i. e,, in dances or other physical motions
repeated so often by the members of a group that they finally



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 231
succumb to a kind of hypnotic suggestion, under the influence
of which they may remain unconscious for hours. 84 In this state the subconsciousness may be abnormally active, and persons of
a certain psychological type may have visions and mystic experi
ences which thereafter control, or at least affect their entire life.
This phenomenon is universal among mankind, being found
among savages, in antiquity, and among the highest religions
of today, as all students of the subject know from such parallels
as the Moslem dervishes, the Jewish Hasidim, and Evangelical Protestant movements among Quakers, Methodists, Pentecos
talists, and others. To primitive man, however, as shown by
L. Levy-Bruhl in his important work, L experience mystique et
les symboles chez les primitijs (1938), certain aspects of mysticism, such as the consciousness of direct communion with
invisible beings, are almost every-day matters, whereas modern
man has relegated them to the background often to his great loss. Mass activity is not essential to the mystic experience in
modern man, since it can be attained through a long course of special ascetic training, as in the Hindu yoga or the somewhat
parallel methods of the Hesychast monks of the late Byzantine age, or through concentrated meditation and prayer, as in the
case of Christian mystics of mediaeval and modern times. However, there can be no doubt that the desired results come much more rapidly and with less effort of will when the indi
vidual is a member of a group, all engaged in the same exer
cises. Moreover, many so-called prophetic phenomena are not
mystical at all, in the proper sense, but pathological. To this
category probably belong most cases of hypnotic and clairvoyant
subjects. The Hebrew seer (ro'eh) was perhaps a clairvoyant,
but more probably an offshoot of the general class of diviners,
which originated in Mesopotamia and spread in all directions as early as the middle of the second millennium B. C. (see
above, p. 159).
85 Balaam (thirteenth century B. C.) was a di
viner, not a prophet, though he played a role somewhat like that of later prophets.
86
The current explanation of the word nabhi\ "
prophet," as
"speaker, announcer/' is almost certainly false. The correct
etymological meaning of the word is rather lf one who is called
(by God), one who has a vocation (from God)," as appears



232 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
from the fact that this is almost always the sense which the
verb nabu,
" to call," has in Accadian, from the middle of the
third millennium to the middle of the first. The king is re
peatedly termed "the one whom the great gods (or a special
high god) have called." Using a noun (nibitu] derived from
this verb, the king is styled
" the one called by the great gods,
etc/' The verbal adjective nabf means "
called," in the Code of Hammurabi. All Hebrew verbal forms from this root are transparent denominatives from the noun nabh?, and throw no
light whatever on the derivation of the latter.87 This interpre
tation of the word suits its meaning exactly; the prophet was
a man who felt himself called by God for a special mission, in which his will was subordinated to the will of God, which was communicated to him by direct inspiration. The prophet was thus a charismatic spiritual leader, directly commissioned
by Yahweh to warn the people of the perils of sin and to preach reform and revival of true religion and morality. There are no clear traces of the prophetic movement as such in Israel before the end of the eleventh century.
38 The only
apparent exception is that of Eldad and Medad (Num. 11:
26 ff.), but the names are pagan and their rhyming assonance
suggests the legendary character of their association. The first
reference which is clearly authentic belongs to the beginning
of Saul's reign, cir. 1020 B. C. However, the Report of Wen
amun, from the early eleventh century, describes a case of
ecstatic trance at Byblus in Phoenicia, which obviously belongs
to the same picture, though it was apparently a pathological condition rather than the result of group activity. It is significant that all early references are to a state of frenzy followed by trance, a fact which indicates that the movement was just
commencing at that time. The correctness of this inference is
supported by Mesopotamian parallels (there is none from
Egypt, aside from the passage just cited, which refers to for
eigners) . In Assyrian inscriptions of the first millennium we frequently hear of a makhkhu, a kind of priest or diviner who
did not belong to any of the regular categories of earlier times.
The derived adverb makhkhutash means " like a madman, in a
state of madness." The words occur only rarely in documents
antedating the first millennium. A collection of extremely in



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 233
teresting poetic oracles from the seventh century B. C. has been
preserved on an Assyrian tablet in the British Museum, dating
from the reign of Esarhaddon. All the oracles are attributed
to different men and women of Arbela, who delivered them in
the name of, their goddess, Ishtar of Arbela. Most of these bearers of oracles were females, but there is not the slightest
concrete basis for the usual assumption (e.g., Jastrow, Langdon, Guillaume) that they were priests.
39
It has been suggested that the ecstatic movement from which
Israelite prophetism arose, is somehow akin to Dionysiac frenzy
and that there was a revival of it in Asia Minor about the end of the second millennium which swept over Greece in one direc
tion and Syria-Palestine in another. The legendary Bacchantic
irruption into Greece, of which Euripides wrote so eloquently,
and the prophetic movement in Israel may then have a common
historical source. 40 Since mass-movements of this type spread
with infectious rapidity, this suggestion is not historically improbable, but it must certainly be modified in at least one
respect. The ecstaticism of the prophets of the Tyrian Baal,
described so vividly in I Kings 18, belongs to the Dionysiac
type, while that of the early prophets of Yahweh as described in I Sam. 10 and 19 has nothing orgiastic about it, but rather reminds one of the activities of certain extreme Pentecostal groups of today. Perhaps the Yahwistic movement arose partly
as a reaction against pagan ecstaticism, which must have threat
ened the religion of Israel as few other movements of history.
In keeping with the point which we made above, that the
nabhf was primarily a man who felt himself specially called by
God for a religious mission, are other facts.41 The true prophet
felt himself to be under a strong compulsion (Jeremiah) or was conscious of an experience which transformed his life (Hosea,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.), i. e., a true conversion, as in
the typical case of Saul (I Sam. 10: 9) . From the time of David
on, the prophetic mission was closely associated with moral and
political reformation as well as purely religious revival, as is
shown clearly by the role of Nathan. It can hardly be acci
dental that the flow of charismatic energy in Israel was diverted
from military and political heroes and leaders to religious leaders almost immediately after the consolidation of the



234 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Monarchy. Seen in this light the establishment of the Monarchy
seems to have been almost a prerequisite for spiritual revival, under the conditions which then prevailed. References to prophetic activity increase in number after the
time of Saul and the movement reached its climax in the ninth century under Elijah and Elisha, who founded schools of
prophets whose members are called " the sons of the prophets,"
i. e,, probably "the members of prophetic houses or groups,"
following widespread Semitic idiomatic usage in that period.
At first sight it is curious that practically no oracles have sur
vived; what we have belongs to the category of Deuteronomic
sermon, though it presumably rests on a traditional nucleus.
The prophets of the ecstatic period, including Elijah and Elisha,
were men of deeds, not men of words, and the ecstatic tradition
was still too strong to be broken. Except in very unusual cases,
no prophet could emerge from an ecstatic experience to give
a poetic address couched in such perfect literary form as are the best preserved oracles of Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah. In other
words, we must differentiate sharply between the age of the
great natural prophets, which came to an end in the ninth cen
tury B. C. and that of the literary prophets, which began seve
ral decades later.42 But the latter carried on the religious move
ment which had been inaugurated by their forerunners, whose
spiritual heirs they most certainly were. If we want to know
how Elijah and Elisha reacted to the evils of the ninth century,
we have only to read what Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah said in
the eighth. Our most instructive historical document for the entire
prophetic movement is the pericope of Elijah. In its present
form it is obviously the product of oral tradition, which has
seized on certain episodes and has developed their dramatic
aspects. The Elijah stories cannot have been handed down long
by tradition, since they bear a very close relation to the facts
of external history as we know them from other sources, and
since they are written in the purest classical Hebrew, of a type
which can hardly be later than the eighth century. At that time
Israel was quivering under a religious invasion which threatened to crush the already seriously weakened body of Yahwism under
its weight. Ahab's queen, Jezebel of Tyre, seems to have been



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 235
an unusually ardent missionary of the cult of the Tyrian Baal,
a god who was generally known in later times as Melcarth
(literally,
" King of the City/' i. e., probably of the underworld,
as in Ugaritic) and of his mother or wife, Asherah (I Kings
18: 19).43 With its epidemic ecstaticism, its colorful ritual of
fertility, and probably its picturesque initiations, it stood in sharp contrast to the sober hues and stern morality of Yahwism, even
when the latter was made more palatable to the common man
by sacrificial ritual and solemn chants. Elijah and Elisha threw
themselves with unexampled ardor into the conflict and won a
signal triumph. The menace of Melcarth was definitely exor
cised, and with its elimination Yahwism triumphed at last over the direct onslaught of Baalism.
A vivid picture of Elijah's theological faith has been handed
down in I Kings 19, which describes his pilgrimage to Horeb,
the Mount of God, where Moses had received his first revelation more than four centuries earlier. The prophet stands on the craggy summit of the sacred mountain, face to face with
his God. First comes a mighty windstorm, which seems to split
the mountains with its force but Yahweh is not in the wind. Then comes a terrifying earthquake but Yahweh is not in the
earthquake. Then a devastating fire but Yahweh is not there.
Finally comes, a gentle, murmuring whisper ("a still small
voice ") and this belongs to Yahweh, the God of Hosts. When
we recall the majestic theophany of Yahweh at Horeb, cen
turies before, and the celebration of the power of God over the elements in subsequent hymns, this complete reversal of
tradition might seem to belong to a different religion. Yet it
is the same religion, with a spiritual aspect which was latent from the beginning and may have been as familiar to Moses
as it was to Elijah, though it could hardly have survived the
vicissitudes of the following three centuries of bitter struggle
for existence on the part of a rugged but earthy people. Yahweh
remained a person, but His spiritual side was henceforth in
creasingly stressed and the external character of His theophany
in nature was more and more restricted to the sphere of poetic
imagery. At the same time that the very nature of spiritual com
munion 44 between the prophet and his God led to the spiritual!



236 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
zation of His relationship to man in general, there was no modi
fication of the dominant concept of Yahweh as a person and as
a person with human emotions, though on a heroic scale and
divested of the littleness of man's emotional reactions. The
Holy One of Israel could do nothing little or cheap; His sense
of justice was a consuming fire which destroyed everything that
violated it. The outstanding concept of God in the Prophetic
Age was His character as a "
jealous God "
(El qanno\ later El qanna
3
}
. Just what this expression means is clear from many passages in which the verb qtnne* and the noun qin'ah occur.
The basic sense of these words is both " to be jealous
" and " to be zealous," and it is a good semantic illustration of the close affinity of these ideas that "jealous" and "zeal" come from the same Greek word, and that German Etfer, "zeal/' is the
stem of Eifersucht,
"
jealousy." Joshua is jealous for Moses's prestige; Saul is zealous to defend Israelite nationalism at the
expense of the Gibeonites; Phinehas and Elijah are zealous to
uphold the sole right of Yahweh to be worshipped in Israel.
Similarly, Yahweh is zealous for the well-being of His people
and jealous of His sovereignty and of the honor of His name. In the ninth century B. C. there was nothing soft or flabby
about the worship of Yahweh. It might still be weak in certain
deeper spiritual values and it might not be perfectly suited for
an era of disillusionment, but for a people of extraordinary
native vitality, which had not yet suffered seriously from the
blows of Providence, but which had advanced rather steadily
in number, in prosperity, and in culture for several centuries,
a full-bodied religious faith was necessary, if the faith in ques
tion was to resist the seductive wooing of a religion of dramatic
affective contrasts and lustful appeal to the senses.
2. The Age of the Rhapsodist Prophets
Between 842 and 836 B. C. the religious revolution inspired
by Elijah was translated into political action in both the North
and the South. With the accession of Jehu in Israel and Jehoash
in Judah the way was clear for undisturbed worship of Yahweh,
according to the ancient custom of Israel. But Baalism was too deeply rooted in tradition and custom to be so easily destroyed.
The Canaanizing elements which had entered into official



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 237
Yahwistic cult with Solomon and Jeroboam were only the
public recognition of an increasing tendency to adapt Baalistic
practices to the local cult of Yahweh in open-air shrines and
at rustic altars throughout the country. Our documentary sources list among such practices the planting of sacred trees
called asherah and of altars of incense known as bamman. The former were called after the goddess of the name, but in one
passage they are specifically referred to as "trees of Asherah/'
which are to be cut down, and elsewhere such terms as "
plant,"
or "chop down" and "burn/* are used of them, so their sec
ondary nature is certain. From the connection in which they
stand td the goddess of fertility it is clear that they were associated with pagan rites of fecundity and some idea of the license to which the periodical celebration of such rites gave rise may
be obtained from the poetic addresses of Amos and Hosea. The
meaning attached to the term bamman has been explained only
recently by H. Ingholt (1940), who has discovered that the
word meant "altar of incense" in Palmyrene.45 This agrees with the etymology of the word, with such references as Hos.
4:13, and with archaeological finds of the past few years, which
have brought to light numerous homed altars of incense in Israelite towns of the period between the tenth and the seventh
century B. C.46 For some reason, presumably because of its extremely close connection with licentious pagan ritual, the use
of incense was opposed in early Israel, and there is no clear evidence for its official use that antedates the Priestly Code.
We may suppose that it entered gradually with the Canaanizing
of temple ritual. When it finally came into general use in Yahwistic ritual it possessed good traditional backing and had
been effectively dissociated from pagan practices/
7
In addition to these pagan cult-objects there were also figu
rines of the goddess of fertility, which appear in definitely
Israelite sites from the time of the Judges on. The earliest ones, from Tell Beit Mirsim in the South, are simply nude females
represented as about to give birth, and there is absolutely no
indication of pagan symbolism about them, so we may safely
suppose that, whatever their origin, they were considered as
charms to aid expectant mothers.48 The characteristic later
forms reflect known Canaanite (Phoenician) prototypes of the



238 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Iron Age, such as standing female figures, fully clothed and veiled with tambourines pressed to their bosoms (representing
the goddess as a musician) , and as female busts whose promi
nent breasts are supported by the hands, as if to suckle an infant
(dea nutrix type) .
49 The former type is common in the North;
the latter is more characteristic of the South. At all events, there is nothing either cultic or obscene about these figurines,
though later biblical writers seem to have included them under
the general head of twaphim (literally, "vile things").
Besides the cult-objects and amulets already described, it is certain from many allusions in the Prophets and the Books of
Kings that there was constant percolation of different non
Yahwistic cults, in particular of novel religious systems and
practices which can, as a rule, only be named without being
described. As Israel became more wealthy and as more and more Israelites took an active part in commerce, the danger of
such pagan intrusion became correspondingly greater. It was
an age of very active syncretism and new religious cults came into Palestine from all directions. Among the innovations were
astral cults (Amos 5:26) from Babylonia, and slightly later
the vowing of sacred horses and chariots to the sun-god in
Assyrian fashion, and the cult of Mesopotamian Tammuz and of Ishtar, the Queen of Heaven,
About the middle of the eighth century Amos appears on
the scene, closely followed by Hosea and Isaiah. 50 Their ap
proach is dissimilar, as might be expected from such different
men: Amos was a poor peasant of Tekoa, one of the poorest
villages of Judah, who (like the modern Arabs of the district)
spent part of his time at home as a shepherd and part of his time as a day-laborer working at one of the most inferior tasks;
Hosea was a man of higher social position who had passed
through bitter marital experiences; Isaiah was a high-born
statesman and royal adviser. But their point of view and their
targets of attack are virtually identical. To all three the wickedness of Israel was comparable to that of the legendary Cities of
the Plain. They were profoundly moved by the decay of reli
gion and the spread of paganism, by the social corruption which
existed on every side, and by the economic oppression which accompanied increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few.



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 239
Amos, the poor herdsman and laborer, inveighed against the
luxury of the rich and their oppression of the poor; in unfor
gettable similes he draws a picture of Yahweh' s anger at the
wickedness of the people and their rulers. Israel's sin is just as heinous as the most notorious atrocities of Damascus, of Ammon, and of Moab, which he names and because of which he threatens dire punishment to these wicked countries. But
since Israel has been chosen by Yahweh from all the peoples of the earth and has learned through a marvellous national
history to rely upon Him, there is less excuse for its persistent wickedness than there is for the sensational outrages of its neighbors. It has often been supposed by modern scholars that
Amos was the first monotheist of recorded Israelite history, but there is not the slightest hint of any such innovation in the
poetic addresses which bear his name. If we follow them with
out any preconceived ideas, we see in Amos a worthy successor
of Elijah, a man on,' fire with zeal for a revival of religion and
of social morality, to whom the Canaanizing practices of official
Yahwism were almost as abhorrent as were specifically pagan
rites, but he was no religious innovator, much less the earliest monotheistic teacher of Israel. Hosea was a man of deep emotional and spiritual life, whose
unhappy matrimonial experience, vividly pictured in two successive passages, served to point his crushing indictments of
Israel. Hosea does not devote much time to social injustice and oppression; for him the trouble lies much deeper, in the
increasing paganizing of Yahwism. His rhapsodic sermons
attack the cult of Yahweh Himself as practiced in the Northern Kingdom; he excoriates the cult of local shrines and central
temples, the dead formalism of sacrifices and offerings, and
especially the role played by the young bull (calf) of Yahweh,
on which he heaps scorn. Israel is a faithless wife, who has
committed adultery and has broken her solemn contract with Yahweh, by virtue of which he espoused her and showered gifts and kindness upon her. Hosea's ideal is a return to the simple semi-nomadic life of antiquity, eschewing both the comforts
and the attendant evils of civilization. 51
Isaiah, coming just when Israel was in the act of collapsing
under the blows of Assyria, and when Judah was seriously



240 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
imperilled, saw the Divine judgment in the very process of fulfilment. His oracles and visions are full of the majesty and awful holiness of Yahweh, and the eschatological element
dominates all else. Isaiah's eschatology undoubtedly had an
Oriental prehistory, certain glimpses of which we get from
time to time. It is probable that the eschatological framework
of later prophecy was largely derived from him.52
D. CATHARSIS
Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah all share the concept of impending
catastrophe, which they employ most effectively in their ser
mons. By the time of Hosea and Isaiah the Assyrian advance,
which had been partly interrupted for half a century, had been
resumed and the new policy of Tiglath-pileser III (746-727
B. C), to conquer small states, deport their populations, and
turn them into Assyrian provinces, was filling Syria and Pales
tine with justified foreboding. The security of immediately
preceding centuries had been rudely broken; wickedness was
on the increase, and the Day of the Lord was at hand. The Assyrian conquest of Gilead, Galilee, and Sharon in 733 B. C.
was followed by the fall of Samaria in the first months of 721,
and later rebellions proved futile; Samaria proper was settled
by newcomers, themselves deported from Babylonia, Elam, and Syria by Sargon, Esarhaddon, and Sardanapalus of Assyria.
Then came Judah's turn. After narrowly escaping in 701 Judah
seems to have been invaded at least twice in the first half of
the following century. 53 After 625 B. C. the rebellion of the Chaldaean Nabopolassar against his Assyrian suzerain gave
new confidence to the land, and Josiah appears to have briefly
reoccupied most of the former territory of Israel. However,
the fall of Nineveh in 612 B. C. and of Harran about 609 B. C
only led to the substitution of Egyptian sway for Assyrian. In
605 Nebuchadnezzar defeated the Egyptians at Carchemish and
some two years later the Chaldaeans occupied Judah. 54 In fif
teen years there were at least three major Chaldaean invasions of
Judah, 65 which was finally brought to its knees by the destruc
tion of Jerusalem in 587 and completely crushed by subsequent
calamities.
It is not surprising that this age of growing insecurity, when



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 241
the very foundations of life were trembling, should give rise
to an earnest effort to find a cure for the increasing malaise of the social organism. Under such circumstances spirits turn with nostalgia to the past and endeavor to recapture the vital ele
ment underlying former prosperity and stability. So the men
of Judah turned back to the Mosaic tradition, endeavoring to
recover it as fully as possible and especially to reorganize the
religion of the state on as pure a Mosaic basis as possible. The
industrious work of the scribal groups to whom we owe the
collection and the writing down of the matter of JE made it necessary for the Deuteronomic reformers to extend their investigations to more remote districts in the search for Mosaic
traditions. Hence we find in Deuteronomy much material which has been correctly identified by Welch, Gressmann and others
as of Northern, Israelite provenience and as coming apparently
from Shechem. This new matter (some of which was already
found in substantially the same form in JE) became the nucleus
of the Book of Deuteronomy. Characteristic of the preamble
and of the other additions made in the late seventh century B. C. by the Deuteronomists is the disproportionate attention
paid to antiquarian points, illustrated by numerous explanatory parentheses. It is very important to note that this nostalgic revival of interest in the past and this pronounced tendency to
archaism, which are otherwise unknown in biblical literature,
have close parallels in contemporary Egypt and Western Asia.
In other words, the Deuteronomic reaction was not an exclu
sively local phenomenon, but was part of a general tendency
which extended to all lands of the ancient Near East. The sun of the ancient Orient was commencing to set and its peoples could not help but be obscurely and unhappily conscious of the
approaching darkness. Since this important point has not
hitherto been understood, we must devote some space to it. In Egypt, after centuries of weakness, a revival of national
spirit was inaugurated by the Libyan princes of Sais, who uni
fied the country and made it independent in the second half of the seventh century B. C. Guided by priests and scribes, whose antiquarian interest had begun to exhibit itself under
the later Bubastites and Ethiopians in the eighth century, the
Saite kings of Dyn. XXVI (660-525 B. C.) deliberately tried



242 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
to restore the Pyramid Age. Drawing and sculpture followed
Old-Empire models so closely that we have examples of early
mural paintings which had been covered by a grid of lines in
the Sake age, for the purpose of assisting copyists to make exact
duplicates of the scenes in question. Royal inscriptions imitated
ancient prototypes; new scarabs bearing the names of pharaohs
of the Old Empire were circulated. In religion an effort was
made to revive ancient gods and forms of cult. In Assyria and
Babylonia the same thing appears. Sargon II (722-705 B. C.) filled his inscriptions with archaisms and with reminiscences of the national epics, which had been composed in Old Babylonian
times. Sardanapalus (668-626 B. C.) collected the greatest
library of the ancient Orient and the first true library which was
installed in a royal palace, so far as we now know. His scouts
explored the magazines of Babylonian temples for lost documents and his scribes copied out thousands of old tablets in
the beautiful chirography of the Sargonid age. His brother, Saosdudiinus king of Babylonia, even had his official inscriptions written in the long extinct Sumerian tongue. Nebuchadnezzar, following the tradition of his immediate Assyrian
predecessors, also harked back to the past, ordering his scribes
to compose a number of his royal inscriptions in the long
disused script and language of early Babylonia, an undertaking which they carried out with notable lack of success. Nabonidus
(556-539) surpassed them all by his zeal for antiquity, which
led him to make excavations in many of the then known temple
sites of Babylonia in order to determine the name and date of the first builders. His scholars were ordered to decipher all early inscriptions which came to light and to date their authors (which they were able to do with relative accuracy though not with absolute precision) . Moreover, he endeavored to revive ancient cults and rituals which had long since been abandoned,
and he thus incurred the bitter enmity of the priests of Marduk in Babylon, whose established prerogatives were threatened by
his innovations. 56
It is highly probable that there was a similar revival of interest in the past in Phoenicia at about the same time or a little
earlier. The discovery of the North-Canaanite mythological
epics of Ugarit has demonstrated the genuinely Canaanite origin



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 243
(aside from Greek names) of the material preserved by Philo
Byblius (see above, pp. 175 f. ) . The latter attributes the collection
of this material to a certain man of Berytus named Sanchunia
thon, alleged to have lived in the time of the Assyrian queen Semiramis (late ninth century B. C). Since the wildest fables
about the latter and about the date of her reign circulated in
the Hellenistic Near East, this proves nothing directly, except
that Sanchuniathon was believed to be relatively ancient. However, O. Eissfeldt has pointed out (1938) that other evidence
makes it difficult to date him later than the seventh century
B. C. 57 The name is found in Carthaginian inscriptions of the
fourth or third century B. C. and the divine name SakMn first
appears in Phoenician personal names of the fifth century B. C. Other onomastic evidence prohibits a date before about 1000
B. C. and makes one about the seventh century most probable. Now, it is very remarkable that there is a veritable flood of allusions to Canaanite (Phoenician) literature in Hebrew works composed between the seventh and the third century B. C. ;
illustrations, which are increasing constantly in number, abound in Job, Proverbs, Isaiah (the exilic sections and Deutero-Isaiah) , Ezekiel, Habakkuk, the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Jubilees, and parts of Daniel, all of which can be dated in their present
form between cir. 600 and cir. 200 B. C. Many of the Psalms
have been adapted from Canaanite prototypes, but here the
question of date is more difficult and some of them may go back to the early Monarchy. This direct literary influence must be distinguished from the indirect influence on poetic style which
we find from the earliest times, as in the Song of Deborah.
The natural explanation is that there was a revival of Canaanite literature about the seventh century B. C., which brought with it not only a renaissance of the early epic literature, but also an
unexampled diffusion of Phoenician writings. How this literature influenced the Jews of the Exilic Age is easy to understand,
since Phoenician and Biblical Hebrew were only dialectically distinct, and there was little more difference between Phoenician and North Israelite than there was between the latter (which
we know from the Ostraca of Samaria) and South Israelite
(which we know from the Bible and from the inscriptions of
Jerusalem and Lachish) . In keeping with the literary revival



244 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
to which we can point is also the fact that the Byblian inscrip
tions of the Persian period contain many archaisms which had
disappeared in normal Phoenician long before the middle of
the first millennium B. C. 58
In the light of these extra-Palestinian parallels the Deuteronomic movement of the late seventh century appears somewhat
differently from the interpretation given it by the school of
Wellhausen. Instead of being a progressive reform based on
an advance beyond previous levels of religion and cult, it was a conscious effort to recapture both the letter and the spirit of
Mosaism which, the Deuteronomists believed, had been ne
glected or forgotten by the Israelites of the Monarchy. The
theory of De Wette and his successors that Deuteronomy is
"
pious fraud " is contrary to ancient Oriental practice (see above,
pp. 44 f.); the materials contained in the book were really
believed to go back to Moses and probably do reflect, in general,
a true Mosaic atmosphere. The first eleven chapters and some other insertions are written in an elaborate rhetorical style without counterpart in the classical Hebrew literature of the early
Monarchy, but with good syntactic parallels in the Lachish
Letters of 589 B. C.59 Otherwise the contents are in large part
considerably earlier, as has been increasingly recognized by
scholars. The Blessing of Moses seems to date from the ninth
century and the legislative portions reflect a juristic phase prior
to Jehoshaphat's reorganization of the judicial system of Judah,
though details have been modernized. 60 The religious-ethical
point of view is, however, definitely that of the seventh century B. C, ; Deuteronomy clearly follows the direction of develop
ment already marked by J, which preceded the height of the
prophetic movement in the ninth century B. C., and by E, which
followed it. The Deuteronomist avoids the inconsistency into
which J and even E sometimes fell by their use of pre-Mosaic
or crude early Israelite matter. To him Yahweh is the sole God
in heaven and earth, who must be worshipped as a spirit with
out any visible form (Deut. 4: 12), He is absolutely pure and
holy, and perfectly just; and He has shown unequalled kindness
to His chosen people, Israel. The influence of Isaiah and his school comes to fruition in the Book of Deuteronomy, in which
the concepts of Yahweh's sublime holiness and of His non



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 245
corporeal nature are strongly emphasized. This contrasts rather
strikingly with the anthropomorphism of early Israelite lan
guage, though the difference was little felt, we may suppose,
by contemporaries, who were so used to poetic imagery that
they did not attempt to derive logical conclusions from it, as
many modern scholars do. Deut. 4: 19 is usually taken to mean
that the sun, moon, and stars had been distributed by Yahweh to the nations as objects of their worship, and it was in fact so
interpreted by most rabbinical commentators. This explanation
is perfectly possible, but the text actually says only that the
heavenly bodies have been assigned by Yahweh to all nations alike (and there is, accordingly, no reason why Israel should
worship them) , whereas Yahweh has chosen Israel as his own exclusive property. There can surely be no question but that
the Israelites knew perfectly well that the visual distribution of the heavenly bodies was the same over surrounding lands
as it was over Israel.
Deuteronomic literature is saturated with the concept of inevitable Divine justice, which is impartially visited upon the individual evil-doer as well as upon the nation as a whole.
For the first time in the records of Israel, as far as we possess
them, the concept of theodicy is inextricably interwoven with
history. The narratives of Judges were collected and edited,
with recurring emphasis on the theme that Divine punishment is always retribution for the sin of the nation. Similarly the chronicles of Israel and Judah were edited, every successive ruler of importance being judged by his inferred attitude to
the correct cult of Yahweh as reconstructed for the Mosaic age
by the Deuteronomic school. No similar works have been
recovered from Egypt, but several are known from later Babylonia, the two clearest of which belong to the end of the second
millennium B. C, as is proved by language and contents. At
that time Babylonia had also passed through a shattering series
of invasions and civil disorders, which had aroused thinking
circles to raise the question of theodicy. In one of them (pub
lished by E. Ebeling in 1923) an ostensibly prophetic appraisal
of successive late Cossaean and Babylonian kings from the
twelfth century is given, each being judged by his relation to
the gods. 61 In contrast to the Deuteronomists this text lacks
17



246 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
any clear-cut sentiment of the causal relation between sin and
punishment. The other document (found in the Spartoli tab
lets) is couched in narrative form and pictures the disasters
that come upon the land and its kings for neglect of the cult
of Marduk. Here the most interesting point is that each invader comes to a terrible end after serving as the instrument of
Marduk, thus being punished in turn for his own offense against
the chief god of Babylonia. 62
The traditional interpretation of the Babylonian conquest of
Judah as almost completely depopulating the country and as
transferring the centre of Jewish life and thought to Babylonia for nearly three generations, has been vigorously criticized by
critical scholars, notably by S. A. Cook and C. C. Torrey. The latter has been extreme in his revulsion against the standard
tradition, maintaining that Judah may have been decimated but
was not depopulated, that the refugees returned to Jerusalem and other towns and reoccupied them soon after the catastrophe
of 587, and that there was no true Babylonian captivity at all.
The centre of Jewish life remained, he supposes, in Palestine,
where it had always been. The mission of the prophet Ezekiel, so far from having been carried out among the exiles in Baby
lonia, is entirely apocryphal. Since there was no "
Captivity," he says, there could not have been a "Restoration"; the tradi
tions preserved in Ezra are as apocryphal as are his memoirs,
and all records of the Restoration except the Memoirs of
Nehemiah are, he insists, historically worthless. The merited
reputation of Torrey as a Semitic philologian has given these disconcerting views wide currency, but they are as totally devoid of historical foundation as they are of respect for ancient oriental records. Excavations in Judah since 1926 have shown with increasing weight of evidence that the Chaldaean destruction of Jewish towns was thorough-going and that few of them
arose from their ruins. Until the excavations at Bethel (which
was in the Assyro-Babylonian province of Samaria) in 1934
no remains of the sixth century which could be dated after cir. 587 B. C. were known; the land was an archaeological tabula
rasa for that period. Work at Beth-zur (O. R. Sellers and the
writer, 1931) and at Bethel (the writer and J. L. Kelso, 1934)
has shown that Jewish revival was slow and that the first



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 247
settlers were few and poor.
63 Innumerable detailed finds, the
most important of which have not yet been published, though familiar to the present writer from personal communications, disprove practically every one of Torrey's concrete arguments
for his position. The facts are precisely the opposite of what
they should be if Torrey's contentions were correct. We need
only point to the work of E. Meyer, H. H. Schaeder, R. de Vaux,
and the writer, who have marshalled the accessible material
against Torrey.6* In short, we are justified in rejecting his position completely, without any concessions except that Torrey's searching criticisms of the sources and their interpretation have
been of immense heuristic value.
The salient phases of Jewish history after the Exile may be
briefly summarized as follows: The final Chaldaean invasion
of Judah almost completely denuded the central hill-country
and the Shephelah of Judah, leaving Jewish settlers only in the Negeb (Neh. 11: 25 ff.), which appears to have been separated
from Judah at an earlier date, and in the district to the north of Jerusalem which was under the control of the Babylonian governor of Samaria. The southern hill-country, south of Beth
zur, was gradually occupied by the Edomites (Esdras 4: 50),
who had been pushed out of their home in Mt. Seir by Arab
invasions. The northern hill-country of Judah was attached to the province of Samaria and the Jewish remnant gradually resettled it after a fashion, reoccupying a number of ruined
villages south of Jerusalem (Neh. 7: 26) . The Jews still hoped
for the restoration of the captive Jehoiachin, who was then
residing with his family in Babylon, as we know from tablets
which have just been published by E. F. Weidner (1940).65 Jeremiah and Ezekiel pleaded with them to be content with
their lot, which was only the deserved punishment for their
sins. However, hope lingered and after Jehoiadhin's death it
was transferred to his grandson, Zerubbabel. The fall of Baby
lon in 539 B. C and Cyrus's promises to the Jewish exiles in Babylonia fanned their growing excitement and stimulated a
vigorous proto-Zionist movement among the Jews of the Dia
spora. Between 538 and 522 a considerable number of Jews
had returned to Palestine, and the Temple was built in the
years 520-515 B. C, but not until there had been an abortive



248 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
revolutionary movement to make Zenibbabel king. The following years are obscure but the data in Ezra 4 make it clear that
the young community in Jerusalem was constantly being hampered in its development by the authorities of the Persian
province of Samaria, who then controlled it directly, as shown
by A. Alt (1934) .
66
Finally, in 444 B. C, Nehemiah, who had attained an important post in the royal household, obtained special authority from Artaxerxes I, came to Judaea as autono
mous governor, built the city wall, and reorganized the adminis
tration of the new province. As a result of Nehemiah's efforts
the official practice of the Temple in Jerusalem, embodied in
the Priestly Code, was made standard for Judaism throughout
the Persian Empire, as we know particularly from the Passover Letter of the year 419 B. C., discovered at Elephantine in Upper
Egypt. Nearly half a century later (397 B. C.) came the priest
and scribe, Ezra, who was armed with special royal authority
to reorganize the ecclesiastical administration of Judaea. The traditional date for Ezra makes him prior to Nehemiah, but this is not only opposed to the indirect evidence of our sources, but is also in direct contradiction to the statements in Ezra 10:6;
Neh. 12 : 23, 26. Since the distinguished Catholic scholar, A. van
Hoonacker, first proposed this shifting of Ezra's date, it has
been adopted by more and more scholars, and may now be said
to be virtually certain.67 Ezra's activity ushers in the period of
the autonomous theocratic state of Judah, which in the fourth
century B. C. struck its own silver coinage and controlled the administration of the Temple treasury for the benefit of the
ecclesiastical authorities. 68
The foremost spiritual figure of Judaism (as we must hence
forth call Yahwism) during the Exile is indisputably the
prophet Ezekiel. Influenced by Torrey's denial of the authen
ticity of Ezekiel, several recent writers, notably A. Bertholet
and S. Spiegel, have plausibly suggested that the prophet may
have uttered some of his earlier prophecies in Judah and some
later ones in Babylonia.69 The writer is not convinced and
believes that R. Kittel's portrayal of Ezekiel's personality and
career (1927) 70 is substantially correct. Ezekiel was one of the greatest spiritual figures of all time, in spite of his tendency to
psychic abnormality a tendency which he shares with many



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 249
other spiritual leaders of mankind. A certain "
abnormality
"
is required to divert a man's thoughts and his emotional experi
ences from the common treadmill of human thinking and feel
ing. While the individual is undoubtedly happiest when his
personality is most fully integrated, the traditional motto, mens sana in corpora sano, is not well calculated for progress since
it conduces rather to stagnation (see above, pp. 68 f.) . Whether the dramatic scenes of life in Jerusalem which he saw in his
visions were literally accurate or not is immaterial, since their
deeper historical meaning can hardly be disputed. Until the possibility of true clairvoyance has been disproved and it can not be disproved merely by justified criticisms of Rhine's cheap
experiments or by unmasking such outstanding mediums as
Palladino or Cranston it would be rash to deny the possibility
of Ezekiel's autoptic visions. As a poet Ezekiel was even inferior to Jeremiah, and neither of them ever touch the lyric and dramatic heights reached almost casually by Amos, Hosea,
and Isaiah; the strength of the great exilic prophet lay in his
vivid imagination and profound moral earnestness, in both of
which he is unsurpassed by any other rhapsodist prophet. The tendency of the latest commentators (especially of Bertholet
and Galling) is to consider the book as essentially a unit, including the pericope of Gog and Magog, as well as the account
of the future Temple. Most of the recent critical dissection of
Ezekiel is unnecessary; it is clear, however, that the manuscript tradition must have been very corrupt, since the present massoretic text is full of doublets and conflate readings, many of which were not yet incorporated in the recension used by the
Greek translators of the second century B. G Unlike his prophetic predecessors Ezekiel could not lay his
principal emphasis on collective guilt, since Israel and Judah
were no longer nations and every Israelite group had to fend
for itself. It is not surprising, therefore, that the idea of indi
vidual responsibility, explicit in the apodictic law (above, p.
205) from the beginning of Yahwism in Israel and emphatic
ally reiterated by the Deuteronomists, receives powerful ex
pression in Ezekiel's words: "The soul that sinneth, it shall
die. The son shall not be responsible for the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father be responsible for the iniquity



250 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be his (alone) and the wickedness of the wicked shall be his (alone) ."
A generation after Ezekiel came the great unknown prophet
whose collected poems were attached to the anthology of Isaiah
possibly because he bore the same name (which was common
in that age, as shown by a number of other biblical and in
scriptional occurrences). The exact extent of the writings of
Deutero-Isaiah is uncertain; competent opinion ranges from
Torrey's view that chapters 40-66 are substantially a unit to
Duhm's complicated dissection. The general opinion of scholars
is that Isa. 40-55 forms a unit, coming from the period just before and just after Cyrus's victory over Nabonidus of Babylon (539 B. C.) . In two respects Deutero-Isaiah marks the culmina
tion of the Mosaic movement as such: in his clear-cut and sweeping definition of the concept of ethical monotheism and in his doctrine of vicarious suffering. It is frequently asserted that true ethical monotheism does
not appear in the Old Testament before Deutero-Isaiah. This
statement is very misleading, as the reader may conveniently see for himself by examining the exhaustive classification of
pertinent data made by Count Baudissin as long ago as 1876.71 Unmistakable claims of world-power and uniqueness for
Yahweh appear with the earliest known rhapsodist prophets,
Amos and Hosea, and become frequent in Isaiah and Jeremiah.
Along with them appears outspoken repudiation of pagan
deities and their claims. For instance, Amos and Jeremiah call
pagan deities "lies" and "falsehood"; Isaiah and Jeremiah
call them "vanities" and "illusions"; Jeremiah and the
Deuteronomic school call them "no-gods"; Ezekiel, the
Deuteronomists, and Jeremiah call them gillulim, which seems
to mean properly "pellets of dung." This list is surely op
posed to the idea that pagan deities were conceded real exist
ence by the prophets. If we had poems or sermons from the
climax of the prophetic movement in the ninth century B. C.,
we should doubtless find the same attitude toward the claims of pagans for their deities. The words of Elijah in I Kings
18: 27 or in II Kings 1: 6 have a flavor of ironic pragmatism
which is quite characteristic of early Israel (see above, p. 220) ;
it was enough for the prophet to deny the pagan god any power,
after which the question of his existence became an unimpor



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 251
tant consideration. As a matter of fact there is no single utterance in pre-exilic sources which sounds as polytheistic as the assertion of the Chronicler (II Chron. 2: 5, which is not taken
from Kings but is quite original with the Chronicler) that
" our God is greater than all the gods." Yet few would claim
that orthodox Jewry was polytheistic in the fourth century B. C. ! In the second century B. C. the Jewish author of Aristeas
declares that the God of Israel is identical with the Greek Zeus and about the same time the translators of the Septuagint
render various Hebrew terms for pagan gods as " demons "
(daimonia) . Moreover, the book of Enoch says that the pagan
cults were introduced by fallen angels and this conception was
generally held both by rabbinical theologians and by the early
Church Fathers. Philp Judaeus sees no harm in identifying the
Hellenic gods and demons with Jewish angels and in regarding
all of them as emanations of the divine essence, forming a
bridge between God and man. In order to understand the view-point of Yahwistic thinkers
of the Prophetic Age (since we cannot directly control the ideas
of their predecessors) , we must bear in mind that they lived
in an age of empirical logic, many generations before the dawn
of systematic philosophical reasoning. Nowhere in the prophetic writings of pre-exilic times is there any hint of cosmic
speculation. The prophets were not interested, so far as we can
tell, in how the world had come into existence or how the forces of nature operated; it was quite enough for them to know that
God controlled them. They had a real moral interest in know
ing why God did certain things, but the idea that any of God's
actions were subject to general physical laws which man might discover by observation and reasoning was totally foreign to
them, as it was to all pre-philosophical thought. Similarly it
was enough for them to know that pagan deities had no real
power and could be over-ruled at any time by Yahweh: whether
their existence was real or only nominal, whether they were angels or demons or simple illusions mattered little, since they were in any event evil or powerless. By the middle of the sixth
century B. C. all was changed for the orthodox Jews; they were
now living in the Diaspora, among idolators, where it was
increasingly difficult for worshippers of Yahweh to preserve
their faith and that of their families. No compromise was



252 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
longer possible; either the pagan gods existed or they did not
exist, and if they did not exist it was well to sweep away all other intermediaries between the invisible spiritual lord of the
universe and His people Israel. The pure ethical monotheism
of Deutero-Isaiah would have been too rarified a faith to have had permanent religious value if it were not for His doctrine
of the infinite kindness and generosity of God, who feeds his
flock like a shepherd, who carries the lamb in His bosom and
gently leads pregnant ewes (Isa. 40: 11). , In order to obtain a clear perspective for Deutero-Isaiah's
concept of vicarious suffering, a brief survey of pertinent germinal conceptions and of the development of belief in theodicy is necessary. Among these germinal concepts may be noted in
the first place the widespread primitive custom of charging
some object, animal, or person with the sin or suffering of a
group, after which the object, animal, or person is sacrificed or
driven away in order to carry the sin and suffering of men away with it. Frazer has collected a mass of illustrative material in
his book, The Scapegoat (1913). The Hebrew ceremony of
the "
scapegoat for Azazel " may perhaps have had a Canaanite
origin. Sumerians and Babylonians also believed that man was
created by the sacrifice of a god or gods, who were killed that
man might live. This is attested by a Sumerian text according
to which the Lamga-gods (the "carpenter*' gods) were killed
that man might be given life with their blood. In Accadian
inscriptions this role falls to the cosmogonic deity Qingu. 72
Behind the gruesome mythology and human sacrifice of the
Canaanites lay the same idea that life and fertility must come
through death and sacrifice of fertility. The sufferings of Attis and of Bel-Marduk were in later times considered as vicarious.
It was hardly possible for such primitive conceptions to ac
quire any deeper religious value until they had been combined
with a much more acute sense of the problem of divine justice
than was possible for prelogical man. The question of theodicy
always comes to the fore during prolonged times of crisis, when
human emotions are winnowed and purified by a sustained
catharsis. So it was in Egypt between 2200 and 2000 B. C,
so it was in Babylonia after 1200 B. C., and so it was among
the Jews between 700 and 500 B. C. In Egypt, however, the
problem of theodicy was not seriously ventilated perhaps the



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 253
time was not ripe. The first clear and detailed treatment of
the problem appears in two Babylonian texts written probably
between 1200 and 800 B. C 73 The older one is well known as
the "
Babylonian Job/' and was entitled " Let me Praise the
Lord of Wisdom," from its opening lines. A man, who seems
to have been originally rich and powerful, complains bitterly
that all his past piety and attention to the service of the gods
have been in vain; he has been overtaken by the most grievous
illness and misfortune, until his whole life is utterly miserable.
No amount of prayer and sacrifice, no efforts of priests or
magicians are of any avail. He concludes that the will of the gods is inscrutable and that divine justice follows different
ways from its human counterpart. At last, after all hope has
been given up, Marduk suddenly turns and rewards him for
his persistent virtue by freeing him from his ban and restoring
his health. The text ends in a burst of praise to Marduk, who
must be adored by men wherever they live,
" as far as the earth extends and heaven spreads and the sun shines and fire
glows and water flows and the wind blows." The other, later
composition was first adequately published by E. Ebeling in
1922, but was not fully understood until B. Landsberger's
treatment in 1936. 74 It is a very remarkable dialogue between
two men, one of whom is a poor wretch who has never had
anything but suffering and who does not believe in the existence of divine justice, a view which he illustrates by many
examples. The other is a pious man who unceasingly preaches
humble acquiescence in the will of the gods, together with
unremitting attention to their cult; after long effort he finally
succeeds in converting his skeptical antagonist. Here also is stressed the inscrutability of divine justice and the need of the most complete humility and abnegation of self in one's relation
to the gods.
In the history of thought, though probably not in time, Job
is intermediate between these Babylonian texts and DeuteroIsaiah. This book, which seems to have been written in the
fifth (or the sixth) century B. C., is built around the story of
an ancient West-Semitic wise man, who must have been well known since Ezekiel brackets him with Noah and Daniel (the
Dan'el of Canaanite legend, who becomes the father-in-law of the wise Enoch in the book of Jubilees, written about the third



254 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
century B. C). The name "Job" first appears in an Egyptian
list of Palestinian chieftains from about 2000 B. C., and also occurs once in the I4thl century B. C. 75 The prose introduction
to the book, as we have it, is written in very late Hebrew and the poetic part is saturated with allusions to Phoenician
(Canaanite) literature. In character it bears an extremely close
relation to the Babylonian works which we have listed and they
may have been known indirectly to the author of Job in some
Aramaic adaptation, just as Accadian, gnomic texts passed into contemporary Aramaic literature in the form of the Akhiqar
Romance. The Hebrew author comes to a conclusion which
superficially resembles that of his Babylonian precursors, though after a vastly superior literary effort. Job rises to the heights of unquestioning faith and plumbs the depths of disillusion
ment and skepticism, while his friends reiterate all the shop
worn arguments for the existence of a direct relationship be
tween suffering and sin. Job has the last word after silencing
his friends (the Elihu speech is generally recogni2ed as sec
ondary), but God Himself replies to him and proclaims His
tremendous superiority to man so eloquently that Job repents
his rebellious spirit and is suitably rewarded. The conclusion
of the author of Job is profounder than that of the Babylonians: suffering is not necessarily a result of sin, but may be inflicted
by the Almighty for the purpose of testing and tempering man.
In other words, human suffering may be part of God's purifying
process. The combination of these two concepts, vicarious
suffering and purification through suffering, lies behind DeuteroIsaiah's doctrine of salvation. The most obvious characteristic of the Servant of Yahweh in Deutero-Isaiah is his humility and meekness in the presence
of his tormentors. Humility, silence, and meekness became increasingly characteristic of ancient oriental piety after the
late second millennium B.C. The inscriptions of the Neo
Babylonian kings (sixth century B. C.) often begin with the
words (following the titulary),
" the meek and humble one."
The words " I am a humble man "
appear at the commence
ment of an inscription of a king of Hamath about 800 B, C.76 Humility is also a characteristic of the worshipper in late
Egyptian and Assyrian prayers to the gods. It is, therefore,
entirely in order when we find the pious worshipper of the



CHARISMA AND CATHARSIS 255
Psalms frequently called *anaw, " humble." This concept can
hardly antedate the Exile in its present form, and we may attribute its increasing popularity to the influence of Deutero
Isaiah and his followers.
After many efforts by Old Testament scholars to interpret
the Servant of Yahweh as the people Israel itself, or as some
historical character such as Jeremiah, Jehoiachin, Zerubbabel,
Cyrus or even Moses (E. Sellin) there has been a pro
nounced reaction. 77 The figure changes so frequently and so
disconcertingly as we endeavor to fix it that we must regard it
in all probability (unless we wish to resort to subjective and futile surgical operations on the text) as a standing theme
which is differently treated in different poems. In other words, the concept is presumably older than Deutero-Isaiah and it so
impressed itself upon his sensitive spirit or seemed so ideally suited to his religious message that he utilized it in various
ways. All of these varying applications have a common theme:
it is the humble Israelite worshipper of God through whom the
people must be saved. Only by submitting to the severest tests
without losing faith or showing a rebellious spirit, only by being ready to undergo the most brutal martyrdom can the
servant of Yahweh do his divinely imposed duty. The experi
ence of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, to say nothing of their prophetic
predecessors, many of whom had suffered cruelly or had even
been put to death, was sufficient to indicate what the true
servant of Yahweh must be like in order to serve his God to
the fullest effect. When not only the leaders themselves, but also every pious Israelite is ready to give himself as a vicarious
victim for his people, then God will restore Israel and will
give it a glorious future. In this interpretation the different
aspects of the Servant of Yahweh receive due consideration.
The Servant is the people of Israel, which suffers poignantly
in exile and affliction; he is also the pious individual who atones
for the sins of the many by his uncomplaining agony; he is
finally the coming Savior of Israel:
My righteous servant shall justify many
And their guilt shall he bear . . . And he shall bear the sin of many
And intercede for transgressors (Isa. 53: 11-12).



CHAPTER VI
IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . .
(Galatians 4: 4)
A. THE RISE AND DIFFUSION OF HELLENIC CULTURE
When we move from Judah of the fifth century B. C. into
contemporary Attica we seem to enter a different world. In
Greece at that time there was a new spirit abroad; men found
that the human mind possessed hitherto unimagined poten
tialities, and there seemed no limit to the beauty that man might create or to the profound truths that his reason might
deduce by introspection and observation. In the fifth century B. C. Israel had reached the summit of its spiritual evolution
and like its Egyptian, Phoenician, and Aramaean (Mesopo
tamian) neighbors, it looked back into the past, seeking the source of life there and endeavoring to preserve that past and thus to avert disintegrating change. This awareness of a rich
tradition and consciousness of national dignity gave a certain
moral grandeur even to late Egyptian and Babylonian literature,
but they were fatal to progress. The Near East had reached the
term of its development and there was little hope of any signifi
cant forward movement without powerful outside intervention.
The imposition by the Persians of a common government on
most of the known world, accompanied by the diffusion of a
common material civilization and of a common Aramaic lan
guage of communication, brought with it countless benefits,
but it also brought inevitable stagnation, just as it did in the
Roman Empire some five centuries later.
In the Greek world, especially in its cultural centre, Attica,
new life was stirring. Though a rarely endowed people, the
Greeks had not emerged from die age of barbarism that fol
lowed the collapse of the aristocratic culture of the Mycenaean
Age until the eighth century B. C. Then they awoke with
startling suddenness and reacted to the advanced civilization of their
^
Near-Eastern neighbors, among whom the Canaanite
Phoenicians undoubtedly played the most important role. The
Greeks of Ionia and the Islands led the way by shifting from
256



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 257
piracy to commerce and colonization, by imitating Phoenician
artistic models, by borrowing the Phoenician alphabet and
adapting it to Hellenic use. About 776 B. C. national events
began to be systematically recorded in writing and a century later arose Hesiod, the first Greek writer whose work and
personality are at all tangible. It is very significant that the
literary aspect of higher culture preceded the artistic aspect
in its development. When the Homeric epics were put into
approximately their present form Greece was in the artistic
barbarism of the early Geometric Age. Hesiod wrote when
Greek art was just beginning to free itself from its swaddling
clothes. The greatest of early Hellenic lyric poets, Archilochus,
Alcaeus, and Sappho, wrote during the century beginning about
650 B. C., when sculpture was still unbelievably stiff and crude
in comparison with its later development. While Thales was
inaugurating Greek philosophical thought about 600 B. C., art still remained oriental and archaic in character. Then, after 500 B. C., came a burst of cultural progress unexampled in
history, which in half a century brought Attica to the age of
Pericles, to the drama of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides,
the sculpture of Phidias, and the painting of Polygnotus.
Greece had now far surpassed the best artistic and literary pro
ductions of the ancient Near East; it was about to reach heights
of philosophical and scientific thought which were to usher in
a new era in human history, the age of logical thinking and philosophical speculation. There is less intellectual difference,
in consequence, between the modern thinking man and his
Hellenic precursor, some 2300 years ago, than there was between the educated Greek of the fourth century B. C. and the learned Near-Eastern scribe of the same period.
The beginnings of Greek philosophical speculation under
the influence of the Milesian school of the sixth century were
modest enough. What we know of Thales, Anaximander, and
Anaximenes does not suggest that they had even reached, much
less surpassed, the empirical knowledge of science and mathe
matics already possessed by the Babylonians and Egyptians. The cosmogony of Thales attributed the origin of everything
to water, just as was true of Egyptian and Babylonian
mythology, as well as of the Priestly Code in Israel. Thales



258 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
borrowed his first notions of geometry and surveying from
sources going back to Egypt and his ability to predict eclipses
came from Babylonia, where it was still a comparatively recent
discovery (going back probably to the eighth century B. G),
It is hardly likely that his actual knowledge of empirical
mathematics and astronomy could compare with that of the
most learned Egyptians and Babylonians of his time. On the
other hand, he possessed something which they lacked: intel
lectual curiosity. Instead of being contented with empirical
knowledge he wished to understand the facts which he had
learned; he wanted to know why things happened and how they happened. For the first time the Ionic Greeks realized that Nature is one and that her manifestations follow definite laws, which man can discover by sufficient effort of his intellect.
Thales's successor Anaximander was able to discard mythology
completely and to erect a logical system of cosmogony which
was entirely free of mythological connotations. When the
European Greeks took up the torch laid down by the lonians,
they made such rapid strides that philosophical speculation
was fully developed and elaborately ramified by the middle of
the fifth century B. C. However, this speculation was generally
(except in the work of Pythagoras and his disciples) devoted to the service of skepticism in religion and its scientific results
were much more valuable than its achievements in the social and ethical field. In the realm of practical morality and of
loyalty to accepted values it was, indeed, so destructive of con
vention and so generally demoralizing that a powerful reaction developed. It is not our purpose to dwell on the great work of Socrates, of Plato, or of Aristotle, since they have become part of our
inherited intellectual tradition and there is no question of vital
importance to us here which remains to be solved, thanks to the wealth of literary sources and to the devoted research of several generations of modern Hellenists and philosophers.
Socrates polished the dialectic method of the Sophists until it
became an instrument which skilfully combined analysis with
deduction; he applied this powerful new tool primarily to the
purpose of ethics and social morality. To Socrates religion was
not less real because he conceived of the divine in immaterial



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 259
form. . . . The majestic edifice of philosophical idealism which
Plato built and the vast structure of encyclopaedic science
which Aristotle erected on a solid foundation of observation
and logical reasoning were already standing when Alexander
conquered Asia and reduced it to the rank of a great province
of Hellenistic culture. The idea that Greece and Hellenic culture were little known in Western Asia before Alexander the Great is difficult to eradicate. Actually, as we know from recent archaeological
discoveries, there was not a century of the Iron Age during
which objects of Greek origin, mostly ceramic in character,
were not being brought into Syria and Palestine. Greek traders a,nd mercenaries were familiar in Egypt and throughout West
ern Asia from the early seventh century on,, if not earlier. As early as the sixth century B. C. the coasts of Syria and Palestine were dotted with Greek ports and trading emporia, several of
which have been discovered during the past five years. None
of these could begin to approach the prosperity of the great Hellenic harbors of Naucratis and Daphne in Egypt. There
were Greek mercenaries in the armies of Egypt and Babylonia, of Psammetichus II and Nebuchadnezzar. About 500 B. C.,
a recently discovered inscription of Darius Hystaspes tells us,
Ionian, Carian, and Lydian craftsmen were summoned to Susa (Shushan) to help decorate the royal palace. In the fifth cen
tury, as we know from Greek sources, the Near East was
flooded with Greek adventurers, among whom were such
learned men as Hecataeus, Herodotus, Ctesias, and Xenophon.
Archaeological research in the past generation has shown that Greek art was by this time highly prized in Western Asia and there is no excavation of any extent in a fifth-century site which
does not yield Greek pottery and other objects. The wealthy Phoenicians buried their dead in marble sarcophagi which had
been carved by Greek craftsmen. The commercial influence of Greece became so great that the Attic standard of coinage began to displace older media of exchange even before 450
B. C. and by the middle of the fourth century Greek coins were
being imitated by the Persian satraps and local rulers of Cilicia, Syria, and Palestine. Even the South Arabians then fashioned
crude local imitations of Attic coins for their purposes. The



260 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
little priestly state of Judaea received permission to strike its
own silver coins, which imitated Attic issues but added the
inscription Yeh&d, "
Judaea," as E. L. Sukenik has recently discovered. 1 From the standpoint of material civilization
Alexander's conquest only intensified and organized a movement which was already well under way.
With this preparation, it is not surprising that Alexander's
triumph found the Greeks amply prepared to take advantage
of it. The Macedonian colonies which he scattered lavishly over Western Asia and Egypt became the centres of an ex
ceedingly rapid process of Hellenization. The following cen
tury must have witnessed a mass emigration of Greeks and
Anatolians (for every Mysian and Pamphylian was now a
Hellene) comparable only to what has happened in Europe
during the past century of migration to America. From Epirus to Pontus and from Sicily to Cyprus, the world of the Northern Mediterranean disgorged its swarms of traders and mercenaries into the Near East. The Phoenicians had become so Hellenized in the preceding centuries that their cities rapidly became foci
of Hellenization. One of the most instructive illustrations of what happened is the story of the Sidonian colony founded by
Apollophanes at Marisa (Mareshah) in the low hill-country
of Judaea about 250 B. C. 2 The Phoenician origin of the colony is established by the numerous Phoenician names which appear
in its tombs during the first two or three generations after its foundation. But it speedily became so Hellenized in language
that all the tomb inscriptions of the second century B. C. are
in Greek and there is even a neatly written interchange of Greek
notes by a lover and his mistress, written on the wall of one of the tombs early in the second century. In the ruins of the town of Marisa was found a quantity of Greek magical curses
on tablets of soft limestone, dating from the second century
B. C. A further example of the intensity of Greek influence is
the mass of papyri from the Ptolemaic age which have been discovered in Egypt. Among the most important of them for
our purposes are the archives of Zeno found at Gerzeh in the Faiyum and published since the War. Some of them refer to conditions in Palestine, throwing considerable light on the
process of Hellenization in the third century B. C.



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 261
Soon after Alexander's conquest of Egypt the cultural centre
'of the Hellenic world was shifted to Alexandria by the pro
longed efforts of two unusually enlightened monarchs, Ptolemy
Lagi (323-285) and his son, Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-247 B. C). In the third century B. C. Alexandrian culture reached
hitherto unequalled heights, stimulated by the presence or the visits of the leading philosophers and scientists of the age.
How brilliant an age it was may be illustrated by the simple
enumeration of a few great names of that century: the Cypro
Phoenician Zeno (cir. 360-263 B. C.), who founded the Stoic
school of philosophy, and his most distinguished pupils, Cleanthes of Assos, Chrysippus the Cilician, Diogenes the
Babylonian, and Antipater of Tarsus; the Athenian Epicurus
(cir. 341-270 B. C.), who founded the Epicurean school; the
geometrician Euclid, who flourished at Alexandria about the
beginning of the third century; the geographer Eratosthenes;
the mathematician and engineer Archimedes, who discovered the first principles of differential calculus in the late third century (not rediscovered for nearly 2000 years) ; Aristarchus of
Samos, who discovered the heliocentric principle of astronomy in the late third century B. C., and his pupil (?), Seleucus the
Babylonian. Such a list as this shows both how active intellec
tual life then was and how international its scope had become.
Many non-Hellenic natives of the Near East caught the
Greek spirit and pursued historical, philosophical, and scientific
studies in Greek fashion. Among the earliest of them were the
Egyptian historian Manetho and the Babylonian Berossus,3 who
put the native chronicles and king-lists into Greek early in the
third century B. C. ; the investigations of the past few decades have increasingly demonstrated the faithfulness with which
they reproduced their sources. Babylonian astronomers, who
had for several centuries devoted painstaking attention to astronomy and in the service of astrology had accumulated
impressive records of their observations, were drawn into the current of international science. They alone among Near
Eastern scholars had continued to develop the empiric science of the ancient Orient, This unexpected vitality of the Babylonian mind, which had slumbered in most respects since the age of Hammurabi, seems to have been partly due to the influx
18



262 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
of new blood which came into Babylonia with the Chaldaean and Aramaean tribes from the tenth century B. C. on. By the
eighth century Babylonia was largely Chaldaean in blood, and
the vigorous new settlers soon became thoroughly Babylonian
in culture. In 747 B. C. a new system of keeping systematic records of astronomical observations seems to have been introduced, and before the seventh century the art of predicting lunar and solar eclipses by use of empirically discovered cycles had been developed. As P. Schnabel has demonstrated (first
in 1923, corrected in 1926, accepted by Fotheringham and
Schaumberger) , the two greatest advances in Babylonian as
tronomy were made by two Chaldaean scholars, Naburianus
(Nabu-rimani) , who flourished about 508 B. C., and Cidenas, about 379 B. C. Through the study devoted by the latter to the older records of solar and lunar observations, with the aid of his own precision and insight, he was able to discover the
fact of the precession of the equinoxes nearly 250 years before
it was scientifically explained by Hipparchus (cir. 130 B. C.),
and to develop the calculation of lunar movements to a degree
of precision which was not surpassed until the eighteenth century A. D., as has recently been shown by J. Schaumberger (1935) .
4 The rediscovered Chaldaean observations of the moon have enabled European astronomers to introduce important corrections into their tables. It is very possible that Cidenas
was already under indirect Greek influence. At all events, the scientific importance of the Chaldaean astronomical records was
well known to Aristotle, who commissioned his pupil Callis
thenes to investigate them, which he did in the year 331 B. C. 5
In the following decades the Babylonian scholar Berossus, who founded a Greek astrological school at Cos about 280 B. C.,
made the first translations of Babylonian astronomical texts into Greek, followed probably by others, since it has been lately
shown by Schnabel and Schaumberger that Geminus (of Tyre ?) ,
the pupil of Posidonius, published Greek versions of Baby
lonian astronomical tables in the early first century B. C6
About 250 B. C. a distinguished Chaldaean astrologist and
writer, named Sudines (Shum-iddin) , was active at Pergamum.
Apparently Chaldaean astrology was favorably received from
the outset in most Greek philosophical circles, and even Hip



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 263
parchus became an adept. The first Greek to popularize it in
Egypt may have been Critodemus, and it was embraced there
with such extraordinary ardor that Egypt became the classical
land of astrological
" research " in the second century B. C.
(Cumont, 1937),
7 thanks to the activity of two native Egyp
tians, Nechepso and Petosiris (cir. 150 B. C.). It is quite possible that these Egyptian astrologers simply took advantage of
the situation to popularize an Egypto-Chaldaean astrology
dating back to the Persian period, to which the legendary
Ostanes must have belonged.8
The Stoic philosophers took up astrology with such en
thusiasm that it became an integral part of the Stoic system in the later Hellenistic period, as illustrated especially by three
successive generations of philosophers, all of Near-Eastern origin: Boethus of Sidon in the second century, Posidonius of
Apameia in Syria (cir. 135-50 B.C.), Geminus (of Tyre?), in the early first century. Posidonius in particular, with his encyclopaedic learning and his facile combination of Stoic with Platonic and Aristotelian views, exercised a tremendous, though somewhat obscure influence over his contemporaries.
9 The Stoic doctrine of the heimarmene ("allotted destiny") and of the essential harmony of the world of nature with the divine
was so perfectly congruent with the principles of Babylonian astrology that they were practically fused. Outside of philo
sophical circles astrology was everywhere received with open arms, so it may be said to have become the fashionable creed of the Hellenistic world in the second century B. C. Theologically Stoic doctrine varied from essentially mate
rialistic pantheism to true theism or polytheism. Above the unchanging destiny of nature the Stoics set the free divine
element which created it and which could rise above it. This
divine element has its origin, they taught, in pure fire, from
which the world came and to which it will ultimately return. This divine fire they identified with creative reason (logos
spermatikos] , which embraced a multitude of embryonic forms,
called " creative reasoning bodies " (16got spermatikoi} . Since the divine must be good and must therefore prevail over evil,
the Stoics built up a theocentric system of ethics, which con
sidered the eternal laws of destiny as essentially good and



264 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
maintained that what seems evil and unjust to man, with his
limited knowledge, would really appear good and just to him i he possessed divine knowledge. This form of theodicy en
joyed exceedingly great popularity in the Near East in later
times and is still the dominant type today in Islam. The Stoic
system could be adapted to any religion, since the Stoics de
veloped an elaborate method by which they explained all the
crudities of Greek and Oriental religion allegorically, treating
them as examples of profound insight into the laws of nature, couched in sensuous dress. Thanks to this elastic quality which
it possessed, to the large part which was taken by Orientals in
propagating it, and to its intimate association with astrology
and other forms of divination, Stoicism was able to color
practically all subsequent pagan thought and to form the philosophical basis for Gnosticism.
Over against the Stoic system stood the Epicurean, which developed almost pan passu with the former and in constant
opposition to it. The Epicureans held in theory precisely oppo
site positions to those which we have just outlined. Where the Stoics saw the operation of eternal divine law the Epicureans
recognized the sway of chance (tyche), which was, however,
considerably limited in their expanded system. Where the Stoics considered doing one's duty as the principal function of
man the Epicureans believed that man's obligation is to enjoy life to the fullest, since the gods either do not exist or will not
interfere and man has no destiny to support. To be sure, the
sounder Epicureans did not maintain for a moment that the
enjoyment of life permitted all sorts of excesses; their con
tention was that reasonable virtue and especially philosophic
detachment from the storms of life are essential to the greatest
measure of human happiness. To the orthodox Epicurean
astrology and all forms of divination belonged to the same
limbo of superstition to which he attributed religious observ
ances and beliefs. Epicureanism was thus essentially anthropo
centric, again in opposition to the Stoics. However, many Epicureans, especially among later eclectic circles, recognized
the existence of a god or of many gods, but did not think that
they took an active interest in man. Epicureanism was more in
keeping with the traditions of Hellenism than with those of



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 265
the Near East, yet we find ample evidence that the East par
ticipated in its development. The best known early Epicurean scholar, Philodernus (cir. 150-75 B.C.), whose writings have
been recovered in part from the ruins of Herculaneum, proba
bly came from Gezer in Palestine,10 and Zeno the Epicurean
was a native of Sidon. In this connection it may be noted that
the Platonist Antiochus (cir. 125-67 B. C.) was born at Ascalon.
Even the ruling Epicurean principle of chance, which seems so foreign to Oriental religion, was actually harmonized with the
latter, and the Greek Good Fortune (agathe tyche) became in
Aramaic dress nahsha tabha, a popular object of worship,11
while every Syrian town had its Tyche (Gadda), identified
with the local divinity. It must be admitted that neither the Oriental nor the average Greek saw a clear distinction between "fortune" and "fate."
B. JUDAISM AND THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE
HELLENISTIC AGE
The fourth century B. C. marks a major interruption in the continuity of Jewish evolution. Until then neither the norma
tive theology nor the basic legal system of Judaism was fixed. It is certain from the literary and historical analysis of the
pentateuchal documents that the Priestly Code, in spite of the
relative antiquity of most of its contents, does not antedate the beginning of the sixth century B. C. It is equally clear that
the four documents were not put together into the present form of the Torah before the Babylonian Exile. Many scholars
follow the Wellhausen school and insist that the Priestly Code circulated in separate form down into the middle of the fifth
century or even into the fourth, but there is no concrete basis
for this view. The Passover Letter of the year 419 B. C. only
proves that the Jewish colony at Elephantine was considered as
heterodox and was probably still in a "
pre-Deuteronomic
"
stage of religious development. Since there is not a single pas
sage in the whole Pentateuch which can be seriously considered
as showing post-exilic influence either in form or in content, it is
likely that die entire Pentateuch was compiled in substantially
its present form before 522 B. C. However, this does not mean
that its form was already fixed according to the standards pre



266 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
vailing in the time of the Septuagintal translation (cir. 250
B. C.) or in that o the Samaritan recension (which Samaritan
palaeography practically compels us to place between cir. 100
and cir. 63 B.C.),12 to say nothing of massoretic standards
more than a millennium later. G. von Rad has demonstrated (1930) that the Chronicler (who must be dated about 400 B. C.
according to recent research) possessed a Torah which must
have been substantially like ours, but which contained a few
laws which are not found in the Pentateuch as we have it.18 At
the same time, the Chronicler went considerably beyond the
pentateuchal law in insisting on the mandatory character of numerous regulations which he regarded as of Davidic origin; so he must have been well on the way to creating a kind of super-Torah. In other words, the Pentateuch had long been
completed by 400 B. C., but there was no standard recension of
it as yet, and different copies contained slightly varying collections of traditional material. This reminds one somewhat of
the relation between different recensions of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, but especially of that between the massoretic
Hebrew recensions of Jeremiah or Ezekiel and the forms underlying the Greek translations of the second century B. C.
The oldest extra-biblical Jewish work is almost certainly the
book of Jubilees, preserved mainly in an Ethiopic translation
of a lost Greek version of the original Hebrew. The latter was probably not written in the late second century B. C., as sup
posed by nearly all recent authorities, including R. H. Charles
and E. Schiirer. Ed. Meyer (1921) was the first to see that the
book must be a century older and that the book of Enoch to which it refers must have been a precursor of the extant book
of that name.14 S. Zeitlin has now (1939) published a strong
argument for a still earlier date and has even suggested that
it might belong to the early post-exilic age.
15 While this date is demonstrably much too high, he shows that the book is older than the time of the disputes between the Pharisees and Sadducees, which began about the middle of the second century
B. C., and that it even opposes many pentateuchal laws and
traditions. If we bear in mind that its historical and geo
graphical point of view is essentially pre-Hellenistic, that its
angelology is on a par with that of Job and earlier than that



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 267
of Daniel and Enoch, that it contains several clear allusions to
Canaanite (Phoenician) mythology and legend,
115 and that all the arguments for a Maccabaean date are feeble, we may attri
bute it to the early third century B. C. (possibly even to the
late fourth century) . An earlier date is rendered virtually im
possible by the presence of numerous Greek geographical names
and by the fact that the war between Esau and Jacob takes place
in Idumaea (southern Judah) , not in Seir, and that Esau is said
to have been buried at Adoraim, which was the commercial centre of Idumaea in the early third century B. C., as we learn
from the Zeno Papyri. Since the Idumaeans had only occupied the southern hill-country of Judah in the sixth century B. C.
(see above, p. 247), sufficient time must be allowed to establish the tradition that Esau was buried in Adoraim.
The book of Jubilees is not only interesting because it shows that the canonic form of our Pentateuch can hardly be earlier than about 300 B. C. and was presumably fixed by the scholars
of the " Great Synagogue
"
;
17 it also illustrates the advance of
Jewish theological ideas at the beginning of the Greek period,
before Hellenism had begun to make any inroads into Jewish
thought. The author of the book repeatedly eliminates or refines passages and concepts which he considers as too crude.
God remains personally aloof from contact with humanity and
His transactions with man are usually carried on through angels.
For instance, the angels, not God, bring the animals to Adam
in order that he may name them; the Presence of God, not God himself, issues the order to destroy the children of the fallen
angels; the angel of God often takes God's place in His deal
ings with the Patriarchs, etc. In the story of the sacrifice of
Isaac, the tempter becomes the head of the evil spirits (Mastema
=
Satan) , whereas in the original God Himself is represented
as testing Abraham. While this advance in the idealization of
God was strictly in keeping with the tendency of prior centuries which reached a climax in Deutero-Isaiah, it nevertheless repre
sented increasing spiritual danger, especially in circles where interest in the letter of the Torah eclipsed attention to the spirit underlying it. It is also characteristic of the times that
astrology, not idol-wotship, serves as the principal target for the author's attacks.



268 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
The most important step toward the Hellenization of Jewry
after Alexander's Conquest was taken during the reign of Ptolemy
Lagi, about 300 B. G, when many thousands of Jews came to
Egypt, either as voluntary immigrants and mercenaries (accord
ing to Hecataeus of Abdera, who was a contemporary) or as
slaves (according to Pseudo-Aristeas, who wrote in the second
third of the second century B. C, as recently shown by E.
Bickermann) ,
18 The substantial historicity of the former statement has been confirmed by O. R. Sellers's discovery at Beth
zur (1931) of a coin bearing the name of Hezekiah, who seems
.to be the priest mentioned by Hecataeus in this connection.19
It is likely enough that Ptolemy carried many Jews as slaves to
Egypt after his capture of Jerusalem. At all events, epigraphic
data make it certain that thousands of Jews settled in Egypt in
the third century B. C. and that they were in the main fresh immigrants, not descendants of the Jewish colonists of the
Persian period. Two Jewish-Aramaic papyri and at least eight
ostraca from Tbo, now Edfu in Upper Egypt, and Zawiyet
el-Meitin have recently been discovered, all dating from the
third century B. C.; their evidence is supplemented by that of
the Zeno Papyri, which contain a number of Jewish names, as well as by that of Aramaic tomb inscriptions from Alexandria
itself and of Aramaic graffiti on coins from Demanhur. The
personal names of the new Jewish colonists do not carry on the
preexilic onomastic tradition, like the Elephantine Papyri, but
belong to three main types: familiar biblical names like Abram, Judah, Joseph, Simeon (Simon) ; Aramaic names not found in
the Old Testament but common later; Greek names. It is curious enough that the list of seventy-two Jewish translators
of the Septuagint, as given by Pseudo-Aristeas, though hardly
quite authentic, reads like a list of contemporary names from
the newly discovered inscriptions! Among the Jewish immi
grants were men of distinguished ancestry, like Akabiah son of Elioenai, a namesake of the Davidic prince mentioned in
I Chron. 3: 24, and perhaps his grandson. In view of this great
influx of Jews, it is not surprising that it became necessary to
translate the Torah into Greek within half a century (about
250 B.C.). That there were still Jews in Egypt who read
Hebrew in the late second century B. C. is shown by the Nash



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 269
Papyrus, containing the Decalogue and the Shema, evidently for ritual purposes; its date, hitherto obscure, has lately been
approximately fixed by the writer.20
The first certain traces of the impact of Greek thought on
Jewish theology appear in the late third century B. C. One is recorded by the Jewish treatise Pirqe Abhoth, a very reliable
work dating from the third century A. D. According to the
tradition which it preserves, Antigonus of Socho, who followed
Simon the Just and probably flourished in the second half of
the third century B. C, taught:
" Be not like slaves who serve the master on condition that they receive a reward, but be like
slaves who serve the master on condition that they receive no
reward; and let the fear of Heaven be incumbent upon you."
The meaning of this passage is generally watered down by
translators, but the Hebrew is clear. Antigonus, whose Greek
name betrays the Hellenistic influence under which he had been reared, here expresses the lofty sentiments which animated the
best of the proto-Sadducean school, who opposed the growing popular belief in a blissful future life, as well as the traditional view according to which the soul continues indeed to exist, but
in a shadowy, inactive state. The authors of Isa. 29: 19 (sixth
century B. C. ?) and of Job already seem to react against the pallid traditional view of Israel, which was no longer enough
for an age which had removed God so far from the world and from contact with mankind. In Jubilees (third century B. C. ?)
we find an interesting intermediate position: the dead rest in the earth and there is no resurrection of the body, but their
souls rejoice in their knowledge of God's vindication of justice.
Ben Sira, however, at the beginning of the second century, states explicitly on several occasions that there is no resurrection;
death is the destiny of all mankind, and when a man dies he
becomes the prey of worms. And yet, the book of Daniel,
the book of Enoch, and other works of the same general age show that a positive doctrine of the after-life had akeady
gained the upper hand as early as 165 B. C, so we may safely
suppose that it had been current for a long time in certain
circles.
The teachings of Antigonus and of Ben Sira, from which later Sadduceanism derived its conceptions regarding immor



270 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
tality, are not simply a continuation of earlier Jewish views,
but represent a definitely new stand on a question which had
always previously remained unsettled, so far as we know.
Pre-philosophical Jewish thought was content to know that the
dead still existed and that their continued existence was in some
way the reflection of their life on earth; it did not ask, so far
as we know, for a precise definition of what constituted the
future life nor did it enquire how we know that the human
spirit continues to exist. But as post-exilic Jewish circles developed increasingly concrete ideas on the nature of the future
life, on the coming of a divine judgment followed by a sharp
separation between the righteous and the wicked probably
under indirect Iranian influence (see below) more conserva
tive groups found it necessary to clarify their opinions. The
Greek dialectic spirit was abroad; debates between adherents of the two influential new schools, the Stoic and the Epicurean,
could be heard on all sides. Antigonus of Socho was evidently influenced by the Stoic position that the foremost obligation of
man was to do his duty, regardless of what might come. Both
orthodox Stoics and Epicureans denied the existence of conscious after-life and the latter rejected belief in any kind of
immortality. The impersonal
" Heaven " of Antigonus sounds
suspiciously like the Stoic heimarmene, though in itself it is
simply a euphemism for the Tetragrammaton, YHWH, which
was no longer pronounced after the fourth century B. C.
Over against the Stoic tinge of Antigonus we may set the
equally clear eclectic coloring of the book of Ecclesiastes, whose
author was probably nearly contemporary with him. The title
applied to himself by its author, Qphileth, is still enigmatic;
it may contain some Aramaic literary allusion which escapes us.
Efforts made to find specific Greek influence in the book have
consistently failed; it is likely that it reflects the general im
pression made by Greek dialectic methods and philosophical
attitudes on a highly intelligent Jew who did not read Greek.21 Ecclesiastes agrees with Epicurean ideas in his view that reasonable^and virtuous enjoyment of life is man's highest good and
in his firm belief that there is no future life at all (3: 19 ff.,
etc.). On the other hand he approaches Stoic teaching in his
emphasis on man's duty to " fear God and keep His command



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 271
ments, for this is all of man/' Moreover, his statement, " Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, but the spirit shall
return to God who made it "
(12: 7) is certainly not Epicurean
but distinctly Stoic, since the latter school taught that human souls were offshoots of the world-soul, to which they returned
after death. Furthermore, Ecclesiastes's doctrine of the cyclic recurrence of natural phenomena (1: 5 ff.) is rather Stoic than
Epicurean, though it probably arose from still earlier sources; but his statements with reference to chance and destiny are
clearly tinged with Epicureanism. The effect of Ecclesiastes's
teachings on the young would be definitely Epicurean, since it
is precisely in those views where he approaches Epicurus most
closely that he diverges farthest from traditional Jewish ideas. Though the misunderstood attribution of the authorship of Ecclesiastes to Solomon and its extremely pious interludes and finale assured the book an ultimate place in the Canon, Epicu
reanism as such was banned by orthodox Jewry and the name
of its founder became synonymous with " unbeliever" in the
period of the Mishnah, and has kept this meaning in Hebrew
ever since. The ppposition between the more aristocratic conservatives
who believed in maintaining old Jewish religious beliefs as they
were stated in the Law and the Prophets, and the representa
tives of the masses, who attributed equal practical value to
later literature and traditions, must have continued to grow in
intensity during the early second century, but it was overshadowed by the far greater actuality of the conflict between
Judaism as a whole and Greek paganism. As has recently been shown by E. Bickermann (1937) the cult of Zeus Olympius
introduced into the Temple in Jerusalem at the same time that
the cult of Zeus Xenius was imposed on the Samaritans, was
actually liberal Judaism in a Hellenized form. 22 In other words,
the Hellenizing high priests Jason and Menelaus (cir. 175-165)
went so far in their efforts to win the support of the new
Seleucid overlords of Palestine that they actually proposed or
accepted the reorganization of Judaism as a Syro-Hellenic re
ligion. In the face of such a menace as this there was no longer
any major significance in the fight against astrology or in the
debate between those who defended belief in the future life



272 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
and those who opposed it. All pious Jews, regardless of party
and creed, now rallied to the support of the Maccabaean
patriots, who struggled with an energy and a zeal seldom ap
proached and perhaps never surpassed in history, until under
Simon (143-135 B. C.) they attained their goal, the autonomy
of Judaea and the purification of Jerusalem. Hardly had this
been accomplished when strife broke out between the Sadducees
and the Pharisees, as the two chief parties were thenceforth
entitled. For two full centuries, from cir. 130 B. C. to 70 A. D.,
Jewish religious life was characterized by this party conflict,
in which the Pharisees gained ground steadily at the expense of their more aristocratic brethren.
Thanks to repeated statements of Josephus, supplemented
and confirmed by other Jewish and Christian data, we know
the essential differences between the Sadducees and the Pharisees. It is very interesting to note that these differences were
basically due to the different ways in which Jewish groups reacted to the challenge of Hellenic ways of thinking. Their conservative insistence on restricting the scope of canonical
Hebrew literature had confirmed the Sadducees in their con
viction that belief in a future life, in a divine judgment, in bodily
resurrection, and in an angelic hierarchy were unscriptural and
therefore contrary to the religion of the fathers. The thinking
of their predecessors, such as Antigonus of Socho and Ben Sira,
who had developed their beliefs under the irresistible pressure
of new Greek ways of thinking, enabled them to buttress these instinctive reactions with a philosophical scaffolding. The
Sadducees, probably reacting against the Stoic attitude of some
of their precursors, insisted on freedom of the human will and
opposed the Stoic doctrine of predestination (heimarmene)
with the utmost vigor. Ben Sira, who may be considered as
the prototype of the Sadducees, again and again declares that
man, not God, is responsible for sin. The Pharisees, on the other hand, allowed for a duality of factors in human life: the
predestination or providence of God and the free action of man's will. In this respect it was the Pharisees who carried on
the Old Testament tradition and who marked out the delicate but fundamental line which orthodox Christianity was to take. 28
In spite of the fact that it was the Sadducees who first came



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 273
under strong Hellenistic influence because of their patrician
connections, it was the Pharisees who eventually became more
thoroughly Hellenized. In fact, we are hardly going too far
if we say that the Pharisaic movement represents the Helleniza
tion of the normative Jewish tradition. This fact seems to have
been first pointed out by E. Bickermann (1935),
24 but he did
not go nearly far enough, since he overlooked the most im
portant aspect of this Hellenizing process, that of the exegetic and dialectic methods employed by the Pharisees in developing
the ritual law. The Pharisees, first of all, laid extraordinary emphasis on study of the law and the formation of schools of
disciples. Ben Sira had snobbishly restricted the professional
study of the Torah to patricians with background and leisure.
According to Ben Sira no craftsman or peasant could hope to
become a sage. On the other hand, the Pharisees believed that
the poorest man might aspire to become a great scholar if he
had enough ability and industry. All this emphasis on the value
of systematic study and on the widest possible scope of educa
tion was foreign to early Israel and to the ancient Orient in general, but was part and parcel of the liberal Hellenistic
ideal. 25 Again, Pharisaic insistence on the need of extending
the operation of the Law to suit new conditions and to cover
all possible eventualities was thoroughly Hellenistic. The
Pharisees took up a slogan which may once have served as a
rallying cry for the members of the traditional Great Syna
gogue, "Make a fence for the Torah," since it is attributed
in the Pirqe Abhoth to Simon the Just in the third century B. C.
Instead of limiting the scope of canonical legislation it now
extended its scope by hedging the rules of the Torah around
with new regulations which protected the observance of the
original rules. For instance, in order to ensure proper Sabbath
observance they introduced many rules defining what constitutes
work, even including under this head many harmless acts such
as carrying a shawl or picking up a towel. In order to ensure that a kid was never cooked in milk (Ex. 23: 19) they set up
an elaborate system of differentiation between milk-foods and
meat-foods, even counting fish among the milk-foods. How
ever, these distinctions were only carried out in detail in tan
naitic times, after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A. D. We men









276 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
standing of Judaism and early Christianity has been greatly
over-estimated. Some scholars have gone so far as to connect
the emergence of pure monotheism among the Jews with the
victory of the Achaemenian dynasty! R. Reitzenstein has de
rived the idea of the " Son of Man " from Iranian sources.
The whole question is immensely complicated by the fact that
the data for the history of Mazdayasnianism (the religion of
Zoroaster) are very obscure and conflicting. In fact no two specialists agree in their interpretation of the evidence, as is
particularly clear if we compare the views of the latest com
petent writers on the subject, such as A. Christensen (1931),
G. Messina (1930), E. Herzfeld (1930), E. Benveniste
(1929), and especially H. S. Nyberg whose recent work,
Die Religionen des alien Iran (1938), is revolutionary in its significance.
28 The following sketch will limit itself strictly to
what has been demonstrated or at least recognized as probable
by the consensus of recent opinion.
Early Iranian religion was substantially identical in general
character and even in detail with the Aryan faith of the Rig
Veda; it was a naturalistic polytheism essentially like Homeric
Greek religion. At the head of the pantheon stood Ahura
Mazda, " the Lord of Wisdom "
(cf. Sumerian Zen, the god
of the moon, whose name has the same meaning) ; among the
most important deities were Mithra, the god of light, and the
goddess of fertility, Ardvisura Anahita, " the Great Stream,
the Unblemished One." This period of Iranian religion is re
flected by some of the Yashts of the Avesta, which have been
only lightly worked over by later Zoroastrian editors; their
constant references to chariot-warriors show that their original
composition must antedate the ninth century B. C. at the latest,
since cavalry had replaced chariotry by that time. Somewhere
in the seventh (or the sixth) century B. C. arose Spitama Zara
thushtra (Zoroaster), member of an Iranian agricultural and cattle-breeding community in the far northeastern marches of
Transoxiana (so Nyberg) , who preached a new gospel, the gen
eral nature of which is clear from the Gathas of the Avesta. It is true that the latter do not appear to have been reduced to
canonical form until about the third century A. D., but they
seem to have been put into writing under the Parthian kings,



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 277
probably in the first century A. D. Judging from linguistic and palaeographic evidence, they were transmitted orally for not less than 500, and perhaps for over 800 years. Zoroaster taught
that there was only one supreme being, the good and bright
Ahura Mazda, against whom stood the independent representa
tive of the evil and dark forces of nature, Angra Mainyu
(Ahriman). Ahura Mazda created five or six (later increased
to seven) minor deities, called " the Beneficent Immortals "
(Amesha Spentas), all of whom bore abstract names: Good Thought, Best Order (Truth), Desirable Domination, Bene
ficent Devotion, Holiness, Immortality, to whom a seventh,
Beneficent Spirit, was later added. To oppose these, Angra Mainyu also created evil deities or spirits. Zoroaster seems to have simplified the native religious cult of the Iranians by emphasizing the sacredness of fire, of the cow, and of the
haoma plant, which was used to make a fermented sacred drink.
According to Zoroaster the good Ahura Mazda will ultimately
prevail over the forces of evil. The old Iranian gods were in general relegated to the rank of demons (daivas) . There must
have been some form of belief in the divine judgment and the separation between the good and the evil in the next world,
but it cannot be traced with certainty back to the Achaemenian
period.
Epigraphic discoveries have made it quite certain that Darius
and his immediate successors (cir. 522-405?) were the only
Achaemenian kings who can safely be called Mazdayasnians,
and some eminent authorities are inclined to deny that even
they were true Zoroastrians. And yet, the inscriptions of
Darius and Xerxes, especially those published by E. Herzfeld in
the past few years, contain nothing which is definitely anti
Zoroastrian, and the references to "Ahura Mazda, the great
god who1 has created heaven, earth, mankind " and to the sway
of the Lie (drauja) , etc., suggest that they were followers of
Zoroaster. However, the Magian priests against whom Darius
fought and the Persians whose religion is described by Herodo
tus about 450 B. C. were certainly not Zoroastrians but rather Iranian polytheists (Magians) . Moreover, about 400 B. C. the
inscriptions of Artaxerxes II abandon Mazdayasnian phrase
ology and frankly list the chief gods of the pantheon as Ahura
19



278 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Mazda, Mithra, and Anahita. About the same time, according to Berossus, as cited by Clement of Alexandria, supported by
a passage in the Avesta, the Iranian gods were first represented
in the form of images. 30 That pre-Zoroastrian Magianism was
the form of Iranian religion which continued to hold sway over the western half of the old Achaemenian Empire, is perfectly clear from the present evidence. In Hellenistic times Magianism was combined on the one hand with Greek paganism (Mithra became Helius, etc.) and on the other with astrology, as is evi
dent from the rock inscription of Antiochus of Commagene in
the first century B. C. It also became strangely fused with
Orphisn* (Cumont, 1934), and the Orphic "Ageless Time"
became identified with the non-Zoroastrian Iranian "Unending
Time" (Zervan Akarana).31 In the late first century A. D.
Mithraism emerged as a rival of Christianity, especially in
military circles.
There is no clear trace of Iranian influence on Judaism before
the second century B. C., though the beginnings of this influ
ence may well go back a century or two earlier. In the form
which Iranian religion takes in all inscriptions and literary sources of the last four centuries B. C. it can hardly have possessed any appeal to the Jews as a monotheistic or aniconic
system. Even in the Gathas Ahura Mazda is only the mighty
head of a hierarchy of good minor deities, against whom are arrayed Angra Mainyu and his evil followers. Iranian influences must have entered into Judaism first as a result of certain features which reminded the Jews of corresponding elements
in their religion. These common features may be identified in Judaism with ease: a tendency toward dualism and to the crea
tion of a personal antagonist to God; a tendency toward the formation of an organized angelic hierarchy; developing belief in the last judgment and in rewards and punishments after
death. In a number of passages in Jewish literature dating
from cir. 400-165 B. C. we find the idea of a personal Satan
developing from the original sense of an angelic plaintiff in the celestial court, where the Almighty was allegorically represented as sitting in judgment over the deeds of men, (Zech. 3 ;
Job 1; cf. for still older conceptions I Kings 22: 19 ff.), to its
final sense of the chief of the invisible powers opposed to God



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 279
(so partly in Jubilees) . But it is not until the late second cen
tury B. C, in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, that we
find characteristically dualistic conceptions: e. g., the spirit of
error is set against the spirit of truth (Test. Jud., 20) and
Beliar (Belial) is set against God (passim), light is opposed to darkness (passim}, and the seven evil spirits are arrayed against the seven good spirits. This type of dualism decreased
greatly in importance in later Judaism and seems, in fact, to
have been rejected by orthodox rabbinic circles, though it obtained considerable popular support in still later times. In
Christianity, on the other hand, the modified dualism of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs achieved a signal triumph, since it offers a simpler and more intelligible solution of the
problem of evil than any other ever proposed. The very fact
that it was rejected by normative Judaism shows that it was
foreign to Jewish tradition, and Iranian influence can hardly be denied, especially in view of the parallels which will be described
in the next two paragraphs.
It is highly probable that the idea of seven archangels was
taken from Iranian sources. In the earlier books of the Old
Testament and the earliest apocryphal and pseudepigraphical literature there is nowhere any suggestion that certain angels
formed a specially privileged group in the celestial hierarchy,
nor do any angels receive personal names identical with those
of human beings. In Daniel (cir. 165 B. C.) Michael and Gabriel appear, and in Enoch Uriel (Ori'el,
" God is my
Light ") and Raphael, as well as many other names, are added.
The number of the principal angels (archangels) varies from four to seven, the latter being distinctly later than the former,
as is clear not only from their literary age but also from the fact that only these four have genuinely early Israelite (or
Canaanite) names, after which all others have obviously been
modelled. It is curious to note that all four names belong to a type which was in most active use before the tenth century
B. C. and which became archaistic after the Exile. There can,
therefore, be little doubt that these angelic figures have a pre
history (Israelite or pagan?) which escapes us entirely.
32 In
any case only the idea of seven chief angels and of their rela
tive station was taken from Iranian sources, since the names
are absolutely diflferent in character.



280 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
The idea of the Last Judgment also has strong Jewish roots,
though Iranian conceptions appear to have influenced details.
Since God was believed to sit in judgment on the deeds o all
mankind (see above) , and since the last Day of the Lord was
an old eschatological concept in Israel, it was a natural transi
tion to the Last Judgment. In the form in which it appears in
Daniel (7:9-12) Iranian influence is most unlikely, but in
Enoch (41: 1 and passim) and elsewhere in the last century
and a half before our era, we find such distinctively Iranian
details as the use of the balance to weigh the deeds of men.33 The apocalyptic picture of the end of the world (e. g., Rev.
8ff.) calls to mind many Iranian parallels, though in view of
the obscurity of Zoroastrian literary chronology, it cannot be definitely shown that they antedate Sassanian times (third
seventh centuries A. D.). The idea of the destruction of the
world by fire is much more likely to be derived from the astro
logical interpretation of the Stoic ekpyrosis, the conflagration which follows a cosmic cycle, since P. Schnabel's studies (1923) have shown that this theory goes back to the last two centuries
B. C84
From the foregoing paragraphs it appears that Iranian conceptions did not begin to influence Judaism until the last two
pre-Christian centuries, and even then exerted no effect except
where the ground was already fully prepared for them. When
we turn to the sphere of influence which we shall term "
protoGnostic," for lack of a better expression, the situation changes
materially. Here, however, even greater caution is needed than
in dealing with Iranian influences, since we are largely depen
dent upon fragmentary bits of information and indirect infer
ences. First we must dispose of the alleged antiquity of the
Mandaean and Hermetic literatures, both of which have been
erroneously traced back to pre-Christian times by eminent scholars.
In his Poimandres (1904) Reiteenstein traced the curious documents of pagan mysticism which are known as the Hermetic Corpus back to the work of the astrologers Nechepso
and Petosiris (see above), now known to have flourished in
the second century B. C Subsequent research has, however,
made it increasingly clear that he was entirely wrong and that



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 281
the literature in question must be in the main posterior to the rise o Neo-Platonism about the middle of the third century A. D., though its roots are undoubtedly older. Hermeticism thus drops out of consideration as a source for any phase of
early Christianity.
85
The Mandaean situation is much more complex and elusive,
but general agreement seems now to have been reached by competent scholars on certain basic points.
86 Since John the
Baptist (Yohanna) is the central figure of the Mandaean
system and baptism in the (symbolic) Jordan plays the principal role in their ritual, it is only natural to look for traces of
very early religious ideas in their elaborate literature. Until
recently, however, Mandaean literature remained virtually inaccessible, because of the peculiar script and dialect of Aramaic in which it was written, to say nothing of a still more obscure
theological and ceremonial terminology and of almost hopeless corruption of the text in many places. These difficulties were
removed by the brilliant work of M. Lidzbarski in editing,
translating, and explaining the principal religious works of the Mandaeans (1905-1925). Since 1937 Mrs. E. S. Drower has begun the publication of her rich folkloristic and mythicomagical data on the Mandaeans of modern Iraq. Lidzbarski
himself inaugurated a period of exaggerated respect for the
antiquity of Mandaean literature, in which he was eagerly followed by such scholars as R. Reitzenstein (1921 ) and R.
Bultmann (1923 ), and numerous others, all of whom en
deavored to demonstrate Mandaean influence on early Chris
tianity, especially on the Gospel of John. W. Bauer incorporated
the new parallels into the second edition of his standard com
mentary on John (1925). 37 Meanwhile, however, E. Peterson
(1923), M. J. Lagrange (1927-1937), F. C Burkitt (1928),
and H. Lietzmann (1930) headed a reaction against these ex
treme views. The criticisms and warnings of these scholars
were so obviously sound that they had great effect; and the sensational discovery of the long-lost original Manichaean literature (in Coptic translations from the fourth century
A. D.), followed promptly by its publication (since 1933),
has almost completely killed the Mandaean fashion, since this
system is obviously later than the Manichaean (third century



282 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
A. D.). The prevailing view today is probably that of Burkitt,
whose philological arguments are decisive: the Mandaean sys
tem arose in southern Iraq about the fifth century A. D., under
the influence of Dosithaean, Marcionite, and Manichaean
teachings. There is probably nothing in their literature which
antedates the fifth century A. D. in its extant form, and most
of it does not antedate the seventh century A. D. 38 Yet the explicit statements of Theodore bar Koni in the eighth century
and of an-Nadim in the tenth indicate that the Mandaean sect
was only a derivative of older groups, among which the Baptist
Dosithaeans may be considered as the oldest. Of real impor
tance is the increasing mass of evidence showing that the
Mandaeans inherited the debris of Canaanite and Aramaean
mythology, on the one hand, and of Babylonian mythology and
folklore, on the other. 39 While nothing in Mandaean literature can be directly employed to demonstrate the existence of a given
conception in the first century A. D. or earlier, Mandaean names, ideas, and practices which can be proved to go back
to pre-Christian paganism often possess exceptional value for the historian of Christian and Gnostic beginnings.
Few problems in the history of religion are so elusive as the
question of Proto-Gnosticism and Judaeo-Gnosticism. Since the earliest literary remains of Gnosticism proper do not ante
date the second century A. D. and, since the earliest Gnostic
known to Irenaeus and Hippolytus was Simon Magus (cf. Acts
8: 93.) it is obvious that we cannot use Gnostic data directly in any reconstruction of Hellenistic Jewish currents of thought.
However, there is now direct evidence that some of the central ideas of the Gnostic system go back into the ancient Orient.
We shall, accordingly, discuss this evidence briefly, after which
we shall characterize Proto-Gnosticism as a movement and
point out its relation to Judaism and Christianity.
The central figure of Gnostic mythology is that of Sophia,
"Wisdom." It is true that the Sophia appears in very different roles in different Gnostic systems and that her figure is split
into two, but the standard form is that of the Lesser Sophia,
who descends from the world of spirit and light into the sphere
of matter, where she becomes besmirched and cannot rise. She
is then raised by God or by a special emanation from Him



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 283
(generally identified by the Christian Gnostics with Christ) and
returns to her original place in heaven. The Lesser Sophia also
received the name Achamoth, " Wisdom," which identified her
with the Canaanite-Hebrew hypostatized Wisdom. The latter first appears in a remarkable gnomic document which has been
incorporated into the Book of Proverbs (ch. 8-9), but which is
now known to be of Canaanite origin, since it swarms with words and expressions otherwise found only in such Canaanite texts as the Ugaritic tablets and the Phoenician inscriptions.* In this document, whose rich pagan imagery offered no
stumbling-block to orthodox Judaism, since it was interpreted
quite symbolically, Wisdom is called both Hokhmab and
Hakhamoth (Hokhmoth}, the latter being a form of probable
Phoenician origin. Wisdom here appears as the first creation
of Yahweh, who was emanated (lit.
"
poured out ") by Him
before the beginning of creation; 41 she also appears as owning
a temple with seven pillars, the cosmic significance of which
is clear.42 The original Canaanite text of Prov. 8-9 can hardly be later than the seventh century B. C, but the glorification of
wisdom has much earlier roots in Canaanite, since we read in
the epic of Baal from Ugarit (cir. 15th century B. C.) :
" And
the lady Asherah of the Sea (consort of El) answered,
' The
wise El has attributed to thee (O Baal) wisdom (hkmt},
together with eternity of life and good fortune/" 43 In the
recently discovered Aramaic Proverbs of Akhiqar, from about
the sixth century B. C, we read: ft
(Wi)sdom is (from) the
gods, and to the gods is she precious; for (ever) her kingdom is fixed in heav(en), for the lord of the holy ones (i. e., the
gods of heaven) hath raised her/' 44 A Jewish counterpart to
this is found in Enoch 42: 1-2 (second century B. C.) :
" Since Wisdom found no place to dwell, she received an abode in
heaven; when Wisdom came to dwell among men and found no abode, she returned to her place and dwelt among the
angels." Ben Sira (early second century B. C.) makes Wisdom
similarly say:
" I came forth from the mouth of the Highest,
and like vapor I have covered the earth; I have made my abode
in the heights, and my throne on a pillar of cloud (24: 3-4) ."
Here Wisdom is poetically likened to a breath issuing from
the mouth of God and spreading until it penetrates into all



284 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
recesses. In the Wisdom of Solomon (7: 25) Wisdom is called
" a breath of the power of God and an emanation (outflowing)
of the pure effulgence of the Almighty/* Finally in Philo
Judaeus we find that Wisdom (Sophia or Episteme) was the
first emanation of God, who created the world and became the
mother of the Logos, remaining herself a virgin, since God
does not generate in human fashion.
These passages, which may easily be increased in number,
prove conclusively that the central concept and myth of the
Lesser Sophia is of Canaanite-Aramaean origin, going back at
least to the seventh century B. C. Sophia evidently replaces an older Canaanite goddess of wisdom, like the Mesopotamian
Siduri Sabitu, who is called in a text of the late second mil
lennium, "
goddess of wisdom, genius of life," and who is undoubtedly the prototype of the sibyl Sambethe, later identified with the Lesser Sophia.
45 There is nothing essentially
Hellenic about either the idea of preexistence, which was char
acteristic of the gods in general, or the idea of emanation, since the latter is simply a euphemistic substitute for the basic idea
of creation by sexual act. All figures of early Near-Eastern and
Hellenic theogonies, both concrete deities and abstractions, were
created by the outpouring of semen; and the concept was so
simple and so capable of receiving philosophical interpretation that it was seized upon by the early Greek cosmologists, from
Thales on. The idea of the descent of Wisdom to earth is probably connected with the myth of the descent of Ishtar or
Anath to Hades, as clearly illustrated by later Gnostic myth
ology. The myth of her elevation to heaven is again transparently connected with that of the exaltation of Ishtar or
Anath to be queen of heaven.46 Gnostic thinkers had merely
to identify the eternal Wisdom with the Iranian world of good
and light, and with the Stoic divine fire and creative reason. Since the author of the Wisdom of Solomon already places God
over against matter in essentially Gnostic fashion, and since he considers the body as the prison of the soul, which exists before
and after life, it is safe to assume that the decisive step toward
a Jewish Gnosis had already been taken in the first century
B. C4T At all events, the elements were at hand, and by the
middle of the first century A. D. they had already been fitted



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 285
into the first known Gnostic system by Simon Magus. Since the latter was a younger contemporary of Philo but does not
seem to have borrowed anything directly from him, we may
safely suppose that both drew inspiration from a common
proto-Gnostic background.
The concept of Sophia completely overshadowed that of the Logos in Jewish as well as in Gnostic thought. In early Chris
tian thought the Logos displaced Sophia, as we know especially
from the prologue to the Gospel of John. The Christian Logos
concept has generally been considered to be specifically Greek, but a brilliant recent study by the Catholic theologian, L. Diirr (1938) , has effectively demonstrated that it is really of Oriental
origin.
48 The idea goes back to a dynamistic conception of the third millennium B. C. (see above, pp. 145 f.) > which makes the
voice of a god act as a distinct entity with power of its own.
Sumerian and Canaanite texts show that the divine voice or
command was concretely represented by the mighty sound of thunder. Later, in Egyptian, cuneiform, and biblical literature,
we find many passages where the command of a god, the word
issuing from his mouth, is virtually hypostatized. For example,
in Deutero-Isaiah 40: 8 we read,
" But the word of our God will exist for ever/' In the Wisdom of Solomon, some four centuries or more later, occurs the remarkable passage (18: 15) :
" Thy almighty Word (Logos) sprang from heaven, from the royal throne, a stern warrior, into the land devoted to destruc
tion, bearing Thy unchanging command as a sharp sword."
As Diirr has shown, with a wealth of illustration, this idea is Semitic, not Hellenic; in the Proverbs of Akhiqar from Ele
phantine (see above), the word of an earthly monarch is described in terms which closely resemble the passage just
quoted from the Wisdom of Solomon: " Mild is the word
(milletha) of a king, but sharper and more cutting than a twoedged sword. . . . Gentle is the tongue of a king, yet it breaks
the ribs of a dragon (tanmn)." In the Judaeo-Hellenistic literature outside of Philo there is
no clear evidence that the "Word" or "Command" of God was substituted for the Divine Name. However, in the Tar
gums there are numerous examples of this development, which
have recently been collected and critically discussed by G. F.



286 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Moore (1922) and by Strack-Billerbeck (1924).
49 The term
used is memra, "word, command/' which is frequently sub
stituted for the name of God in passages which were considered
as likely to be misinterpreted and thus had to be protected against further misconstruction. In Deut. 3: 22, for example,
it is not God but his Memra which fights for the Israelites (cf.
also Ex. 3: 12; Gen. 21:20). In Deut. 4:24 it is not God
Himself but His Memra which is a consuming fire; in Deut. 9: 3 His Memra is a consuming fire which goes before Israel.
In the light of the entire rabbinic material, Moore was per
fectly justified in insisting that Memra is a " verbal buffer to
keep God from seeming to come to too close quarters with
men and things/ However, in view of the extraordinarily close
parallelism between such uses of Memra in the Targums and the examples from Aramaic and Judaeo-Hellenistic literature which have been cited above, it is perfectly clear that the tar
gumic Memra is simply a fossilized expression surviving from
a period when influential Jewish groups were engaged in
"
building a fence " around the holiness of God, by substituting words denoting aspects or qualities of Him, such as Divine Wisdom, the Divine Word, the Divine Presence (Pamm in
earlier times, Yeqara in later), for His Divine Name. It is
still uncertain whether Philo's combination of Wisdom with
the Logos by considering the latter as son of the former (in
other passages this idea is variously modified) was original
with him or was derived from older sources. If the writer is correct in explaining the divine names of the
Jewish pantheon at Elephantine in the fifth century B. C. as
hypostatized aspects of Yahweh, we should have a paganizing
prototype of Philonic hypostatic speculation, completely stripped
of its philosophical trappings, at least a century before Alex
ander the Great. 50 According to this view, the three divine
names Eshem-beth'el, Herem-beth'el, *Anath-beth*el (= 'Anatfa
Yahu) , meaning respectively
" Name of the House of God " (=- God) ,
" Sacredness of the House of God," and "
Sign( ?)
51
of the House of God " would reflect pure hypostatizations of
deity, probably influenced by contemporary Canaanite-Aramaean
theological speculation, in which Beth'el frequently appears as
the name of a god (from thej seventh to the fourth century



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 287
B.C.). 52 However this may be, it is clear that pagan theo
logical conceptions had entered into post-exilic Jewry through the circles to which these Jews belonged, and through hereti
cal groups like the Phrygian Jews who identified Sabazius with
Hebrew Sebaoth. 58 Of course, all such divagations were vigorously repulsed by orthodox Judaism, but as in most such cases
the very intensity of the reaction produced somewhat analogous
phenomena in reverse. Just as the Church Fathers, from the
second century A. D. on, found it increasingly necessary to
employ Greek philosophical methods and terminology to explain their views to non-Christians as well as to defend them from heretics, so Jewish thinkers of the Hellenistic age were
compelled to adapt the methods and the terminology of their
pagan antagonists to their own purposes, both in order to combat the latter and in order to distinguish between orthodox Judaism and the vagaries of such groups as the Essenes and
the Therapeutae. Moreover, the direct evidence of Jewish
writings from the period 600-200 B. C. proves that pagan
Phoenician literature was then exerting a very considerable direct and indirect influence on Jewish thought, and the evidence of the Elephantine Papyri and of Tobit demonstrates
that pagan Aramaic literature also began to exercise similar influence after the sixth century B. C.
It is increasingly clear that indirect pagan influences entered
mainly through the compositions of eschatologists, who swarmed in Jewry during the period which began with Daniel and Enoch
and which ended with the Apocalypse and IV Esdras. The
eschatologists were pneumatic souls who saw visions of the future while they were in ecstatic condition, and translated them
into words with which they stirred men's imaginations and
whipped them up to action. Without unfairly identifying the phenomena of ecstatic vision with ordinary dream-life, there
can, be no doubt that they both exhibit a divorce between con
scious will and involuntary imagination, a separation which leads to unusual and often fantastic associations of ideas. At
the same time, the spiritual exaltation of the visionary is undoubtedly transferred to his subconscious mental life, where
it is translated into grandiose and often majestic imagery, drawn from many different sources and often quite destitute of any



288 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
logical connection, though all the more powerful in its emo
tional effect. In practice, conventional ideas and patterns of
imagery would prevent the visions of an ecstatic from assuming
the pathologically bizarre forms illustrated by De Quincey and Baudelaire. Through the eschatologists innumerable elements of pagan imagery and even entire myths entered into the litera
ture of Judaism and Christianity, though it is safe to say that only an infinitesimal amount of the original mass has actually
survived, since visionary excesses invariably repel sober scribes
and theologians. The admission of Daniel and the Apocalypse to the Christian canon has immeasurably enriched the affective
and aesthetic life of Christianity, without in the least demoraliz
ing its theology (except in the case of certain chiliastic sects) .
Among the eschatological groups we may count the enigmatic
Essenes, who already formed a distinctive Jewish sect in the
second century B. C. Since we possess none of their writings
but only descriptions of their tenets and their organization given by Philo and Josephus (who had spent some time with
them in his youth), it is difficult to place them in the religious
history of the time. None of the alleged Hellenistic elements of their system can stand serious criticism, in view of our lack
of first-hand documentary sources, since Philo and Josephus
were both given to Hellenizing Jewish phenomena which they described. They rejected marriage and lived in semi-monastic
communities, owning everything jointly. They also rejected bloody sacrifices, though they still revered the Torah and the Temple. In place of the sacrificial system they introduced an elaborate system of sacramental meals and of lustration with
water. They further possessed an extensive esoteric literature,
access to which was only allowed members of the order. Accord
ing to Josephus, they were interested in the virtues of plants
and stones, they possessed an elaborate angelography, knowl
edge of which was incumbent upon the neophyte, they were
rigid predestinarians, and they attached great importance to the
art of predicting the future, in which they seldom made mis
takes. The last three statements are particularly significant,
since we can only infer from them that the Essenes, in opposi
tion to virtually all pre-cabalistic Jews, were believers in
astrology, which harmonized just as well with their strict pre



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 289
destinarianism as it did with the Stoic heimarmene. It is hardly likely that any extant Jewish esoteric works, from Enoch to the Qabbala, can be attributed to the Essenes, at least in their present form. It seems probable that the Essenes represent a
sectarian Jewish group which had migrated from Mesopotamia
to Palestine after the victory of the Maccabees. 54 This theory
would explain their interest in the virtues of plants and stones (Berossus is said to have composed a treatise on the latter subject), their attention to divination and astrology, their fre
quent lustrations (hygienically necessary in Iraq, but not in
Palestine), as well as their prayer to God for sunrise, per
formed daily before dawn, facing eastward, since all of these
points were characteristic of Mesopotamian practice. Moreover, it is easier to explain their refusal to take part in sacrificial
ritual if they had come from a region so far from Jerusalem
that performance of sacrifices was physically impossible at the
time when their beliefs were crystallized. The relatively great ceremonial significance of lustration with water in Mesopo
tamian ritual has been repeatedly emphasized; and it is now
known that the Euphrates was the centre of a cult of water
traceable in the upper Euphrates Valley from about 2800 B. C.
to the third century A. D., when we have a mosaic showing the
river-god Euphrates with an accompanying bilingual caption in
Greek and Syriac:
" King (river) Euphrates." In the second
century A. D. there was a Baptist sect of Gnostics whose cult of the living water of the Euphrates is thus illustrated by Hip
polytus: "We are the chosen pneumatics from the living
Euphrates which flows through the midst of Babylon "
" Mesopotamia is the stream of great Ocean flowing from the
midst of the perfect man/' As has been shown by the writer,
on the basis of Mesopotamian iconography (1919-24), the
concept of the water of baptism as " a fountain of water gush
ing forth to eternal life" (John 4: 14), whose effect on the
believer is such that " rivers of living water shall flow from
his belly" (John 7: 38) is not only genuinely Oriental but is
specifically Mesopotamian in origin.
55 It is significant that the second citation is quoted by St. John from an otherwise unknown
written source, which at least proves that there was a proto
baptist literature which was definitely tinged with proto-Gnostic ideas.



290 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
In this milieu John the Baptist must certainly be placed, since
he combined the zeal of an Israelite prophet with a true soterio
logical passion for saving souls from the wrath to come (Mat.
3: 7), and since he united an unusually pronounced asceticism
with the practice of initiating converts into the kingdom of
God by baptism in the Jordan, Unfortunately, we know next
to nothing of his own doctrine; and that of his alleged pupil
and successor, Dositheus of Samaria, is even more obscure, though Simon Magus is said to have emerged from his school.
Since John the Baptist was a prophetic evangelist who taught
that repentance, confession, and baptism must precede remission
of sins, it is most unlikely that John's system was itself proto
Gnostic. However, it is generally recognized that John forms
the most important channel through which eschatological and
soteriological ideas and practices passed from Essene or proto
Gnostic sources into Christianity. The speculations of R, Reitzenstein with regard to the origin of Christian baptism
(1929) have been effectively refuted by H. H. Schaeder and
others, 56 and may now be considered as antiquated. The view
that Christian baptism originated in the Jewish baptism of gentile proselytes, which is attested as early as the first century
A. D. as shown by J. Jeremias (1929),57 is possible, but it is
perhaps more likely that both go back to a common source
among the Essenes or a similar group. 58
One of the most characteristic features of the eschatological
pattern of this age is the doctrine of the divine Messiah who
was to appear in human form and who was regularly entitled
" the Son of Man/' The latter feature of this belief has been
referred by W. Bousset (1913), R. Reitzenstein (1921), and
C. H. Kraeling (1927) to the Iranian myth of the archetype
man, Gayomart, which undoubtedly did underlie some of the
later Gnostic conceptions of the figure of Anthropos (Primal
Man) ,
59 Not content with this hypothesis Mile. Maryla Falk
has recently (1937) tried to derive the complex Logos
Anthropos system (or rather its reconstructed form) from the
Hindu figures of Purusha and Vac. Since both the systems
which she compares must be reconstructed from disparate ele
ments before they can be equated at all, and since the con
necting links are missing, we can hardly treat her hypothesis seriously.
60



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 291
Practically every detail of Jewish messianic expectation may
be shown to be derived from the Old Testament, especially
from Isaiah and Deutero-Isaiah. However, in the earliest
apocalyptic literature, Dan. 7:9-14 and Enoch (passim), we
encounter another belief: the Son of Man is represented as
residing in heaven, where he was created by God before the creation of the world in order to appear as Messiah in the
fulness of time. The ramifications of this Jewish belief in the
preexistence of the Messiah, traces of which survived into rabbinic times in the idea of the preexistence of the Messiah's
name, have been discussed fully by W. Bousset, G. Dalman,
and others, and need not concern us here. The meaning of the
term " Son of Man " has been discussed so often in the past generation that all possibilities would seem to be exhausted. However, this is not quite true, since there is important cunei
form evidence which remains to be properly appraised, though
attention has been called to it by H. Zimmern and other
Assyriologists. We now have extensive remains of a Neo
Assyrian mythological epic which is generally called " Ea and Atrakhasis," the nature of which is elucidated by another
Assyrian fragment and two long fragments in Old Babylonian,
from the first quarter of the second millennium B. C. 61 These texts describe the beneficent intervention of Atrakhasis on behalf of mankind at least twice when it was threatened with
complete destruction, once from a prolonged drought and once
from the great Flood. 62 The standing appellation of Atrakhasis
(lit. "the Very Wise One") in the Assyrian recension (sev
enth century B.C.) is "man" (amelu). Similarly, in the
Adapa myth, the hero is also called both " the Very Wise "
(using the same expression) and " seed of mankind "
(zer
ameluti), i. e.,
" member of the human species." It is, in fact,
very likely, though by no means certain, that Adapa(d} is the
Sumerian name (meaning perhaps "chosen counsellor") of
the figure which was commonly called Atrakhasis. Since
Hebrew ben 'adham and Aramaic bar nasha both mean pri
marily
" human being
" in distinction to " man," as we know
from a great many occurrences and similar expressions in these
languages, the expressions are all parallel. There are a number
of points, into which we shall not enter here, which make it



292 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
very probable that Atrakhasis, the recurrent Mesopotamian
savior of mankind from catastrophe, son of the god Ea, yet
explicitly called " man," was actually fused in Jewish-Aramaic
tradition with the figure of the Messiah, as reconstructed from
messianic prophecies in the Old Testament. On the basis of
the attested Jewish belief and its probable prehistory it is, there
fore, practically certain that Christian tradition was correct in
recognizing the term " Son of Man " in the Gospels as explicitly stating the messianic role of Jesus.
D. JESUS THE CHRIST
1. The Documentary Sources
During the century that has elapsed since K. Lachmann made
the revolutionary observation (1835) that the Gospel of Mark
underlay both Matthew and Luke, New Testament scholars
have labored very industriously to build up a logical system of
historico-literary criticism, analogous to what was accomplished in the nineteenth century by Old Testament critics of the Pen
tateuch. By the World War there was general agreement with
respect to two Gospel sources, Mark and Q, which included
many sayings of Jesus found in both Matthew and Luke but
not in Mark. Since Matthew and Luke often reproduce these
sayings in the same order, Q was taken to be a real entity and
not a hypothetical construction (see below) . Beyond this point
there was no agreement, and the residue of matter in Matthew
and Luke which came neither from Mark nor from Q was
sometimes explained in one way, sometimes in another. The
Gospel of John was set apart from the Synoptic Gospels and
was considered as much later in date. The usual chronological
scheme was simple: Mark and Q were prior to the Fall of
Jerusalem in 70 A. D.; Matthew and Luke were dated between 70 and 90 A. D.; John was placed between 90 and 120 A. D.
The radical members of the Tubingen and the Dutch school
thought that John was even posterior to 150 A. D., but they
had very few adherents in this extreme position. To maintain
it they were forced to perform the most remarkable somersaults in dealing with early Christian tradition and literature.
In 1919 M. Dibelius, followed closely by R. Bultmann and



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 293
others, introduced the new method of Formgeschichte, usually
called " form-criticism " in English. This may be defined as
an effort to get behind the documents (Mark, Q, etc.) to the
oral sources, especially by grouping the latter according to
their form and their literary character, but also by analyzing
their " Site im Leben," i. e., the situation in which they arose or through which they were modified. Dibelius was at first strongly influenced by E. Norden, H. Gunkel and others, but since material for the analysis of form was too often lacking,
he and his successors have pushed their research out in in
creasingly subjective directions. As we have already pointed
out with emphasis (see above, pp. 38 f.), the principle of
aetiology must be used with great caution in fixing the historical content of oral tradition, since it works both ways, i. e., aetio
logical explanations originate as a necessary didactic aid to memory and the reversal of the process is a strictly secondary
phenomenon. Moreover, Dibelius and Bultmann, together with their followers, endeavor first to reconstruct the life of the
earliest Church, the methods of preaching and evangelizing
which it employed, and the development of Christian doctrine,
after which they determine the hypothetical
" Sitz im Leben " of a given verse or passage, in order to judge its historical value
or more usually to reconstruct its evolution as a literary entity.
As E. Fascher has pointed out, the leading exponents of the school disagree completely in their theories as to the relation of the principal categories of form-criticism to the life of the
early Church, and vicious circles are evident throughout their
work. 63 The method employed by form-critics is essentially an
application of the "
logico-meaningful
"
principle of Sorokin (see above, pp. 66 ff.), which is only a prolix statement of the familiar adage,
" The proof of the pudding is the eating thereof." In practice it becomes a complex case of the logical
fallacy known as argumentum in rirculo, except where it can
be controlled by entirely independent outside facts. In New
Testament studies such outside facts are seldom available and many of those which have at one time or another been thought
to exist, have been disproved by the progress of archaeological
and papyrological research. From the standpoint of the objective historian data cannot be disproved by criticism of the acci
20



294 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
dental literary framework in which they occur, unless there are
solid independent reasons for rejecting the historicity of an
appreciable number of other data found in the same framework.
However, form-criticism has yielded some very valuable re
sults, first by classifying the material found in the synoptic
gospels under such heads as apothegm-stories (sayings of Jesus for which the rest of a narrative serves as a framework),
miracle-stories, parables, and various types of logia (sayings),
and secondly by pointing out a number of blocks of material
which may be traced directly back to Jesus in their present form
(e. g., Mat. 5: 17-48; Mat. 6: 25-32; Luke 6: 27-38) . A number
of scholars, notably C. F. Burney and B. S. Easton, have discovered striking phenomena characteristic of Hebrew and
Aramaic verse in some of these blocks, and have thus enhanced
the probability that we are dealing with original matter. 64
The next important recent advance in uncovering the sources
of the Gospels has been made by C. C. Torrey, who published
his first study, The Translations Made from the Original
Aramaic Gospels, in 1912 and has recently followed it with
two works (The Four Gospels, 1933; Our Translated Gospels,
1936), in which he has collected the results of a generation of
work on the Aramaic sources of the four Gospels. In these and
other studies along the same line Torrey undertakes to demon
strate that the whole of Mark and Matthew, most of Luke, and the entire Gospel of John were written in Aramaic, from which they were translated into Greek. This sensational conclusion
he reaches by marshalling an impressive list of awkward trans
lations from Aramaic into Greek, together with reproduction
in Greek of syntactic and idiomatic peculiarities of the supposed
Aramaic original, as well as direct errors and misinterpretations.
Torrey concludes that all the Gospels were written before 70
A. D. and that there is nothing in them which could not have
been written within twenty years of the Crucifixion. It is diffi
cult to imagine a more complete volte-face than would be
necessary for New Testament criticism if Torrey's views were
proved correct. He has consequently been attacked with the
greatest vigor by many New Testament scholars, led by E J
Goodspeed and D. W. Riddle. Other scholars, few of whom
are specialists in the New Testament, have rallied to his sup



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 295
port, but the majority remains on the side-lines, equally awed
by Torrey's learning and impressed by the authority of his
antagonists. 65 The present writer holds an intermediate posi
tion, as will become evident in the following brief discussion.
To begin with, there can be no doubt whatever, in spite of
various innuendoes, that Torrey is thoroughly competent as an
Aramaic scholar and that he is at home in all the Aramaic
dialects of importance for this type of research. Quite aside
from his personal record as an Aramaic philologian is the
endorsement of his competence by such authorities as T.
Noldeke and E. Littmann.66 Moreover, it must be said em
phatically that his basic method is sound: first, the analysis of types of translation Greek and the systematic comparison of
them with standard Greek prose of the Hellenistic period; secondly, an exhaustive search for phenomena in the Greek of
the Gospels which are hard to explain except as evidence of
translation from Aramaic. Every philologist who is familiar
with languages can immediately detect the original tongue
from which a given translation was made, if he knows both the original language and the one into which the translation
was made. There are many amusing and instructive illustra
tions of linguistic phenomena peculiar to translations. Judged
by the severest standards, it must be said that Torrey has proved
a respectable proportion of his examples. On the other hand, there are difficulties which Torrey has not surmounted. There
is no literary Greek of precisely comparable type, since the Koine, or vulgar Greek of the time, was not used for literary
purposes and the examples from contemporary papyri, though extremely valuable for grammar and vocabulary, are yet very
different in subject, style, and atmosphere, as pointed out effec
tively by A. D. Nock, who writes (1933): "Any man who
knows his classical Greek authors and reads the New Testament and then looks into the papyri is astonished at the simi
larities which he finds. Any man who knows the papyri first
and then turns to Paul is astonished at the differences. There has been much exaggeration of the Koine element in the New
Testament." 67 Much more serious than the lack of comparable
Greek is the absence of any satisfactory examples of Pales
tinian Aramaic from the period 50 B. C.-70 A. D., aside from



296 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
over two hundred inscriptions, the majority of which consist
only of one or two names each.68 The inscriptions prove, more
over, that the Jewish Aramaic of the first century A. D. was
different in detail from the official Aramaic of the Persian
Empire (which continued in use for a century or two after
Alexander as a literary tongue), from the contemporary Ara
maic of the Nabataean and Palmyrene inscriptions (which was
much like the literary Aramaic of the Persian period), from
the Mesopotamian Aramaic of the Peshitta, from the Jewish
Aramaic of the Targums and the Jerusalem Talmud (which
belongs mainly to the period 300-600 A. D., as we know from
contemporary synagogal inscriptions), and from Christian
Palestinian Aramaic (which seems to belong to the seventh
century A. D. and later) .
69 To be sure, there were many ele
ments common to all these dialects, and a trained linguist is generally safe in inferring the existence of a word or a form
at a given period from earlier and later occurrences of it. In addition to these linguistic sources of error is the fact that Torrey, Burney, and others often base their theories on arbitrary judgments as to what the original text should have said. More
over, Torrey neglects many of the assured as well as the proba
ble results of New Testament criticism, both textual and
literary and no amount of clever improvisation can replace sound philological method. The present writer believes that Torrey has demonstrated
the existence of a much more important and much more far
reaching Aramaic substratum of our Greek Gospels than had
been suspected previously by any competent scholar. On the other hand, not a single case of alleged scribal error adduced
by Torrey is convincing. The most plausible examples can just
as well be explained as failure to hear correctly or to understand the precise sense of a recited Aramaic word or form, For instance, it would be a simple matter for a listener to confuse the
passive plural participle *abbidhin9 "(they) are done," with
the active 'abhedMn, "(they) are doing," since the accent was
on the last syllable in both cases. In other words, the Aramaic substratum may be entirely, or almost wholly, oral. The sig
nificance of this observation appears from the demonstrated
fact that the teachings of contemporary Jewish scholars were



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 297
handed down mainly by tradition. It has already been empha
sized (see above, pp. 33 ff.) that oral composition and transmission of literature played a far greater role in antiquity than
is generally supposed. As is well known, even Graeco-Roman
writers generally composed and polished their work orally
before reducing it to writing. This had always been the custom and writing materials were' too expensive to be wasted on tenta
. tive efforts. Even today the old-fashioned Jewish or Moslem scholar never dreams of looking up passages in the Bible,
Talmud, or Qur'an, but depends on his memory for citations.
It follows that we should not expect to find the words and acts
of Jesus put into writing until the expansion of missionary
activity, the flood of new gentile converts, and the menace of
heretical teachings made it practically impossible to continue without written documentation.
J. Jeremias has recently (1930) pointed out, following T.
Soiron, that the sayings of Jesus common to both Matthew and
Luke are not only often arranged according to a common word or idea, which serves as a connecting link, but often differ in their order because of the selection of different words or ideas to serve as a bond. 70 He has correctly observed that this phe
nomenon is so characteristic of oral transmission, which is accustomed to utilize similar mnemotechnic devices, that one can only conclude that the first and third Gospels drew their
" Q " matter from related oral sources. The efforts so far made
to Weaken the force of this argument are extremely feeble, and the observation must stand. However, Jeremias goes unneces
sarily far in using it to prove that the supposed source Q never
existed. We must rather admit the existence of oral collections
of material, which assumed slightly differing forms as they were circulated among early Christian communities. With our present evidence it seems rather hopeless to try to reconstruct
the exact development of the synoptic Gospels from the Ara
maic form in which substantially all of the pericopes and categories which have been isolated by form-critics must once have circulated, to the final form which they assumed not later than
about 80 A. D. All we can; say is that a period of between
twenty and fifty years is too slight to permit of any appreciable corruption of the essential content and even of the specific



298 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
wording of the sayings of Jesus. When we compare this in
terval with the centuries of oral transmission between Moses and the reduction of JEP to writing, or between Zoroaster and the final codification of the Avesta under the Sassanian kings, or between Rabbi Aqiba, for example, and the writing down of the traditions which circulated about him, it hardly seems possible that there was any serious modification of the historical
tradition. We have mentioned the case of Rabbi Aqiba because of the reconstruction of his career published by L. Finkelstein in 1936, an account which is almost entirely based on Jewish tradition, some of it not put into writing for at least four cen
turies after his death. Of course, Finkelstein's portrait is not
necessarily correct in detail, but it is very interesting to see that a satisfying reconstruction can be presented on the basis of such
data. The characteristics of oral transmission which we have
repeatedly emphasized above appear clearly in the synoptic
Gospels: tradition has exercised its selective and refining in
fluence, eliminating sayings and stories which did not suit the idea of Christ which the early Christians acquired from the
mass of first-hand tradition about Him as well as from their
vital religious experience of conversion through faith in Him.
In some respects tradition may have idealized; in other respects
it just as certainly failed to grasp the true stature of Jesus. The beneficial effect of oral transmission more than outweighs the
slight historical loss through refraction, combination, and formation of doublets. However, only modern scholars who
lack both historical method and perspective can spin such a web
of speculation as that with which form-critics have surrounded the Gospel tradition. The sureness with which early Christian
leaders distinguished between normative and aberrant sayings
of Jesus becomes very clear when we analyze the so-called
agrapha, or apocryphal logia, collected from extant and from recently excavated documents. The agrapba generally express
gnostic or antinomian ideas which are foreign to the Gospels
(for an illustration cf. above, p. 137). 71
The Book of John stands apart from the synoptic Gospels,
as recognized since the time of Origen (third century A. D.V
In view of the extremely late date to which it has often been assigned, Torrey s demonstration that it rests on an Aramaic



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 299
substratum has been peculiarly resented by many New Testa
ment scholars, though it has been enthusiastically accepted in
principle by men of the standing of J. de Zwaan (1938). 72
Meanwhile the sensational publication of a fragment of the
Gospel from the early second century (C. H. Roberts, 1935)
and of a roughly contemporary fragment of an apocryphal
gospel dependent on John (H. I. Bell, 1935) has dealt the
coup de grace to all radically late dating of John and has proved that the Gospel cannot be later than the first century
A. D. There can be no doubt that John is the latest of the
Gospels, but it is hard to accept the usual critical view that it mainly reproduces ideas of its author and cannot claim to reflect
the thought of Jesus. As has been repeatedly stressed in recent years, the personal allusions in the Book are so intimate and
express so sensitive and delicate a spirit on the part of the
author that pious fiction is psychologically almost unthinkable.
At this period we cannot, it is true, urge the relatively complete absence of pious fraud from contemporary literature as an
argument for authenticity (see above, pp. 44 ff.), but we can
effectively stress the psychological argument, as emphasized by
F. Torm (1913) and others. 73 Moreover, the objections to the
authenticity of the Book because of its alleged ignorance of history and geography have been considerably reduced in re
cent years. 74 One cannot, of course, place John on the same level with the synoptic Gospels as a historical source, but one
is quite justified in maintaining that it does reflect a side of
Jesus which was too mystical for the ordinary man of that day
to understand and which He presumably held in reserve for a
few intimates. The authors of Hebrews (5: 12 f.) and I Peter (2:2) recognized the difference between teachings suitable for
neophytes and for advanced disciples, and St. Paul takes this
point repeatedly for granted. It would be rather strange, to
say the least, if the apostolic recognition of the difference between simple teachings which could be understood by all and
more profound intellectual or mystic doctrines which could
only be understood by a limited number did not go back to the
example of Jesus himself. That the Apostles actually followed His example is proved by the references to Jesus's messianic
secret in the synoptic Gospels. The advanced teachings of



300 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Jesus as transmitted by the Gospel of John contain nothing that
can be reasonably adduced as evidence of late origin. The slight
dualistic element was already present in Judaeo-Hellenistic
literature as a legacy from Iranian religion. The so-called
Gnostic elements have little in common with later Gnosticism and are rather proto-Gnostic; they consist mainly in a revival
of dynamistic concepts and metaphors, such as identification of Jesus's person with abstractions (the way, the truth, and the life) and with concrete entities (light, bread, vine). Since these ideas strike deep into the psychic inheritance of mankind,
and since they do not form the basis of any mythology, as with the Gnostics, their tremendous affective and emotional value is evident, and has been demonstrated by two millennia of Chris
tian believers and mystics. Practically every motif in the Gospel
of John can be paralleled in the synoptic Gospels; it is only
the rich accumulation and development of ideas which is different.
In dealing with the Gospels the historian cannot but see a profound difference between their contents and typical examples elsewhere of matter which has been long transmitted by
oral tradition. What we have in them is rather a reflection of
reports of eye-witnesses who were overwhelmed by the pro
found experiences and the extreme tension of mind and body
through which they had passed. Men who see the boundary
between conventional experience and the transcendental world
dissolving before their very eyes are not going to distinguish
clearly between things seen in the plane of nature and things
seen in the world of spirit. To speak of the latter as " halluci
nations " is quite misleading, since nothing like them is other
wise known either to historians or to psychologists. Here the
historian has no right to deny what he cannot disprove. He
has a perfect right to unveil clear examples of charlatanry, of
credulity, or of folklore, but in the presence of authentic
mysteries his duty is to stop and not attempt to cross the
threshold into a world where he has no right of citizenship.
2. The Religion of Jesus
During the past thirty years the work of C. Montefiore,
I. Abrahams, J. Klausner, L. Finkelstein, and other Jewish



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 301
scholars, ably seconded by such Christian specialists as H. L.
Strack and P. Billerbeck, P. Fiebig, J. Jeremias, R. T. Herford,
G. F. Moore, H. Danby, has succeeded in revolutionizing our conception of the character and the development of the Phari
saic movement. It is true that most of these scholars represent
the Pharisees of the time of Christ as prototypes of the rabbis
of the second century B. C, thus failing to allow for such
factors as a pronounced change in the relative place allowed to
eschatology by the Pharisees. It is probable that the first-hand
epistles of St. Paul present a more accurate reflection of certain aspects of the Hillelite school in which Paul was educated than do the tannaitic traditions of the second century A. D. 75 Yet
we may whole-heartedly accept the rehabilitation of the Phari
sees, who were God-fearing men with views which closely
approximated standard Christian theological positions with
respect to the attributes of God, the question of predestination
and free will, and the problem of the after-life. On the other
hand, the Pharisees were rigorous legalists and their great aim
was to perpetuate the Jewish Torah in the purest possible form,
in order to maintain Israel's privileged place as the chosen
people of God. This aim was in itself a noble one and it has
proved astonishingly successful in keeping Judaism and the Jewish people intact until our day, in which they are making
contributions to Western civilization which would not have
been possible if they had been assimilated into the gentile world
many centuries ago. For this great achievement we may thank
the Pharisees without reservation. 76
But the teaching of the Pharisees was not at all suited to
become the vehicle of a great evangelistic movement, which
was to embrace all mankind in its parish and was to transform
Jewish doctrines of man's relation to God into a new religion
of incomparable vitality. So reaction against the Pharisees had
to come. With Jesus this reaction assumed the only form it
could effectively take, that of a sweeping religious reformation,
in some respects following the lines of the prophetic movement
some nine centuries previously, in some ways prefiguring the
Franciscan movement of the thirteenth century and in other
ways the Wesleyan revival of the eighteenth. Again and again
Jesus insisted that He came to fulfil the Torah and the Proph



302 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
ets, not to destroy them. In order to fulfil them, however, He
rejected the increasing mass o secondary regulations and restrictions, to some extent following precedents set by the Samaritans, the Sadducees, and the Essenes, but adopting a consistently spiritual attitude to ritual which was foreign to any of
these groups. His hostility to the Pharisees as a body was based
mainly on His profound sympathy for the poor and suffering,
to whom the Pharisees as a group showed charity but scant
sympathy, feeling in typically puritanic fashion that their misery
must somehow be the result of sin. Jesus's attitude toward the
"
under-privileged
" was in no sense comparable to that of
modern exponents of the " social gospel," and it was still less
like that of Marxian socialists. He fully recognized the close relation between sin (i. e., violation of natural and moral law)
and suffering, but to Him suffering was not only the normal
divine punishment of sin but a potent requisite for salvation,
putting the unhappy and disoriented soul into a state of recep
tivity to Divine grace. Suffering was thus a blessing, or it was at least capable of yielding a blessing to the receptive sufferer. Through Jesus's exaltation of suffering the old problem of
theodicy received a powerful new solution, one which had been
at best only adumbrated in the Old Testament and which seems to have been quite foreign to Greek thought. This exaltation of the value of suffering had no ultra-ascetic nor encratic aspect,
since Jesus did everything possible to alleviate the suffering of
others, at the same time that He showed His own willingness
to eat and drink with friends and hosts. In this respect as in
others, we can only admire the exquisite balance of Jesus's
ethical teachings and the success with which He could state them so dramatically and categorically that none could miss
their meaning, yet without failing to correct over-emphasis
whenever it became necessary. In the fine balance and the
universality of His ethics we may detect Hellenistic influence
(see below) . It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the true greatness
of Jesus's ministry does not lie in His ethical teachings. The
ethics of Jesus agree strikingly, if compared in detail, with contemporary Jewish ethical teaching, as may be seen by read
ing the exhaustive collection of early rabbinic parallels given



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 303
by Strack and Billerbeck. Moreover, even the Golden Rule, which is nowhere adequately stated in rabbinic sources, has an excellent Assyrian parallel from the seventh century B. C. (at
the latest) :
" As for him who doeth evil to thee, requite him
with good "
;
77 the connecting link is perhaps furnished in part
by several passages in Judaeo-Hellenistic literature. It is, how
ever, true that in no pre-Christian or Jewish source do we find
the same accumulation of lofty ethical injunctions in brief
compass. Nor do we find elsewhere that astonishing balance
with regard to fundamentally non-religious and societal ques
tions such as the relation of master and servant, of state and subject, and such as the place for resistance and non
resistance, etc. Jesus has been turned into a social revolutionary,
a pacifist, a prohibitionist, a royalist, a republican, a Y. M. C. A.
secretary, an anti-Semite, but every effort of this kind has been
accompanied by flagrant disregard of the material as a whole.
On the other hand his ethico-religious doctrine has been considered by Christian theologians as too exacting for normal
human life and has accordingly been labelled "interim ethics,"
i. e., ethics to be practiced only during the brief period of
waiting for the end of the world and the last judgment. This
view seems to be correct so far as expectation of the imminent
end of the world is concerned (see below) , but since Jesus is
never represented as basing His ethical code on the nearness
of the last judgment, it is far more reasonable to assume that
He meant people to live on just as high a moral plane as they
would if the end were expected at any moment. That this interpretation is correct would follow logically if one of the
Oxyrhynchus logia which makes Him bid His disciples live as
though every day were Sabbath, is authentic. Lofty as the ethical teachings of Jesus are, they might not be considered quite so impossible to carry out in life if would-be followers
were not inclined to make their own eclectic selection and
exegesis of injunctions to be followed.
The idea of God in the Gospels is no longer restricted to
the lofty, but rarified ethical monotheism of Deutero-Isaiah.
A nearly complete cycle separated the beginnings of Israel from
the beginnings of Christianity, and the anthropomorphic con
cept of God in early Israel returned at the end o this cycle to



304 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
the centre of our field of vision but the human form and emotions of Yahweh had become spiritualized in the process. God
still loves and hates in the New Testament, but His love has far wider and deeper connotations. There is still only one God,
as in Israel, but the acute danger of polytheism is over and He
appears in different hypostases or aspects. In one hypostasis
He has drawn even closer to man than Yahweh could in earliest Israel, when He was still father and brother and kindred to His
own (see above, p. 187) . In another hypostasis He is the one
eternal Creator and Lord of the universe, as He was to Deutero
Isaiah. In still another He is the Holy Spirit, alternately con
ceived as the Divine Wisdom or as the Paraclete. It should hardly be necessary to add that the trinitarian idea of God has
immeasurably enriched the concept of monotheism, without in the least detracting from its unified character.
Even though we deny the substantial influence of Hellenism
on Jesus's idea of God and admit it only in the Patristic Age,
we cannot fail to recognize the profound effect of Hellenism in the formation of Jesus's other religious ideas. In them there is a fine Hellenic sense of balance and of proportion which are
foreign to contemporary Judaism. Even in reacting against the exaggerated emphasis laid by the Pharisees on the Torah and
against their essentially Hellenistic dialectic (see above) , Jesus
replaced this form of Hellenism with a far wider and deeper
one: Hellenistic universalism and philanthropy, which underlie
the whole subsequent history of Christianity.
78 It has. often
been stressed of late that He was born and reared in a land
(Galilee) where Jews, Syro-Phoenicians, and Greeks rubbed shoulder to shoulder, and where cosmopolitan influences were
stronger than anywhere else in Jewish Palestine.
Vital to all understanding of the teachings of Jesus, as well
as of the faith of the earliest Church, is the problem of His
messianic consciousness and eschatological doctrine. This im
portant question has been brought into the foreground of
discussion again after several generations during which theo
logians and New Testament scholars did their best to evade it or to maintain that Jesus was either not conscious of being the
Messiah or first reached this conclusion toward the end of His
ministry. The messianic framework of the Gospels was re



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME ... 305
garded by most up-to-date scholars as quite a secondary thing, imported into the primitive Church long after the Crucifixion.
However, increased realization of the antiquity and the inescapably messianic connotation of the expression
" Son of Man "
(see above) has of late brought increasing recognition* that Jesus's messianic consciousness was the central fact of His life.
No treatment of the subject which tries to evade or to deny
this fact can hope to do justice to it. Jesus was the spiritual
heir of a long line of Jewish eschatologists (see above), who had developed an elaborate doctrine, part of which is clearly
documented in the Gospels. The messianic framework of the
Gospels cannot, indeed, be proved to reflect the beliefs of Jesus throughout, but its central features clearly antedate the Cruci
fixion. And these central features are the belief that the Messiah is both Son of Man and Son of God (created according to Enoch before the beginning of the creation of the world) ,
and that He is to suffer abasement and eventual death at the hands of His own people, for whom He will shed His blood
as a vicarious and expiatory sacrifice.
It is true that most New Testament scholars have tried to date the introduction of these basic features of Christology
(i. e., messianic doctrine, since Greek cbristos is simply a literal translation of Hebrew mashiah) to the Apostolic Age, between
30 and 50 A. D. or even later. Against this, however, is the whole weight of early Christian literature, combined with the difficulty of positing a situation where the scattered and often
opposed groups of apostolic Christians could agree on such startling innovations. Paul and Peter fought bitterly over the
question of the extension of ancient Jewish ritual to gentile
converts; they would certainly have fought much more bitterly over any supposed innovations with respect to the person of
their Lord. This dilemma has been felt by the exponents of the
"
Christ-myth
"
hypothesis, notably by its most recent advocate, P. L. Couchoud, whose historical extravagances would other
wise merit no attention whatever. To this school there never
was a historical Jesus but only a savior-god, Christ the Lord,
who was originally worshipped by a pre-Christian sect resem
bling the Roman mystery-religions. Opponents of this school have no trouble in pointing out the total lack of any real



306 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
parallel for such a sect or for its alleged teachings quite aside
from the incredible hypothesis that there is no historical basis
for the Gospels or for the teaching of St. Paul. It is historically
dangerous to adduce parallels from Gnosticism in its manifold
forms, from Mithraism, from Isiac, Neo-Pythagorean, and Hermetic systems, or from Apollonius of Tyana, since most of
these parallels cannot be shown to antedate the second or even
the third century A. D. The first known Gnostic, Simon Magus, was for a time in intimate contact with Christianity (see above) . All that can be proved from a detailed study of the mystery
religions of the Roman Empire is that there was widespread
spiritual discontent and deep-seated yearning for salvation in
the first century A. D., 79 and that St. Paul seems to have
adopted a number of expressions and points of view which had
originated with adepts of the mysteries.
80
On the other hand there are many striking parallels with more ancient Near-Eastern religious ideas, such as the virgin
birth of a god, his astral associations, birth among cattle, im
prisonment, death, descent to the underworld, disappearance
for three days, resurrection, exaltation to heaven, etc. 81 It is true that some of these parallels can be shown at once to be probably secondary: i. e., there is no mention of the descent
to the underworld in the Gospels (though it already appears
in I Peter 3: 19) and the three-day interval in the tomb is
actually reckoned as two. However, a sufficient number of direct parallels remain to indicate a relationship of some kind.
What that relationship may have been, we cannot determine by historical methods, but a reasonable explanation for part of
it is at hand, though it must remain theoretical. We have in
the Gospels a great many allusions to messianic predictions in
the Old Testament. Rendel Harris and others have suggested
that the first written document of Christianity consisted of a
collection of these messianic passages, in the form of " Testi
monies." However this may be, there can be no doubt whatever
that Jewish eschatologists of the last two pre-Christian cen
turies had combed the Old Testament for messianic prophecies,
and every messianic detail in the New Testament has its correspondence somewhere in the Old. With these texts from the
Old Testament they combined (as in Enoch and later apoca



IN THE FULNESS OF TIME . . . 307
lypses) miscellaneous matter drawn from apocalyptic visions
which were considered authoritative. As we have indicated
above (pp. 287 .), examination o Jewish eschatological literature discloses many reminiscences of pagan Near-Eastern
literature through which apocalyptic imagery was greatly em
bellished and as a result of which Christian affective and mystic
life has been immensely enriched. It is, we maintain, through
the channel of Jewish eschatological literature, most of which
has inevitably perished, that the field of messianic prophecy
was extended to cover many verses which were not recognized as properly messianic by orthodox Jewish tradition. This prin
ciple would both explain how many passages of the Old
Testament which have no original messianic application were
so interpreted and how the messianic framework of the Gospels
came to bear such a striking, though quite superficial, resemblance in details to the corresponding framework of the cycles
of Tammuz, Adonis, Attis, Osiris, etc. The affective religious
value to early Christianity of these superficial resemblances
must have been very great, since the cycles to which we have referred had been gradually put into extraordinarily effective
dramatic forms, all essentially alike in principle (see above,
pp. 144 f.) . The underlying dramatic forms which had swayed
the religious emotions and impulses of the Near East for three
millennia made the same psychological appeal to the multitudes
of the first century A. D. as they had to their forefathers and
they still exert as powerful an effect today. The new religious content of this ancient framework was, however, as different as light is from darkness. The Church Fathers saw truly when
they represented these aspects of paganism as part of the divine
preparation for Christianity. We can never know to just what extent details of the messianic tramework of the Gospels are
literally true. Because of their highly intimate and personal character some of them are set forever beyond the reach of the
critical historian, within whose epistemological range they can not be drawn (see above, pp. 75 ff.). In other words, the historian cannot control the details of Jesus's birth and resurrection
and thus has no right to pass judgment on their historicity.
On the other hand the historian is qualified to estimate the
historical significance of the pattern and its vital importance



308 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
for the nascent Christian movement as embodied in the person
of its Master. A number of coincidences between a literal sequence of events and a traditional pattern are necessary before the former can be appropriated and modified by the latter (see
above, pp. 35 ff.). It follows that the historian must recognize the presence of an important factual element in the Christian adaptation of the messianic tradition. Since, accordingly, there
can be no complete factual judgment and since the historian cannot settle questions which are outside of his jurisdiction, the
decision must be left to the Church and to the individual be
liever, who are historically warranted in accepting the whole of the messianic framework of the Gospels or in regarding it
as partly true literally and as partly true spiritually which is
far more important in the region of spirit with which the
Christian faith must primarily deal. The historian, qua his
torian, must stop at the threshold, unable to enter the shrine of the Christian mysteria without removing his shoes, conscious
that there are realms where history and nature are inadequate,
and where God reigns over them in eternal majesty.



EPILOGUE
The task which we have set ourselves is completed; the reader
must decide whether we have succeeded in executing it. In
covering a field of such extent, both chronologically and geo
graphically, the underlying historical pattern may sometimes
have been obscured by unconscious selection of data. At other
times the fragmentary nature of available material has made it
hard to discern the texture of the pattern. Throughout we have resisted the temptation to modify our statement of historical
fact in order to produce a simpler but less objective picture.
We have endeavored to make the facts speak for themselves,
though our care to state them fairly and to provide evidence
to support them, where necessary, may sometimes have made
it difficult for the reader to follow the unfolding scroll of
history.
How does the picture of the history of monotheism which
emerges from our study compare with the picture which has
been handed down by biblical tradition? The tradition of Israel represents Moses as a monotheist; the evidence of ancient Oriental religious history, combined with the most rigorous critical treatment of Israelite literary sources, points in
exactly the same direction. The tradition of Israel represents
the Prophets as preachers and reformers, not as religious inno
vators; rigid historical and philological exegesis of our sources agrees with tradition. Christian tradition represents Jesus of Nazareth as the Christ of faith; historical and literary criticism, assisted by the evidence of Near-Eastern religious history, finds
that there is nothing against the tradition except prejudice.
Mosaism is a living tradition, an integrated organismic pattern,
which did not change in fundamentals from the time of Moses
until the time of Christ; Moses was as much a monotheist as
was Hillel, though his point of view may have been very dif
ferent in detail. Christianity is also an integrated organismic pattern; it arose with Jesus of Nazareth, not with Paul or John, and its orthodox branches have modified their basic faith only
in detail. A double strand runs through our treatment: first, the as
cending curve of human evolution, a curve which now rises,
21 309



310 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
now falls, now moves in cycles, and now oscillates, but which has always hitherto recovered itself and continued to ascend; second, the development of individual historical patterns or
configurations, each with its own organismic life, which rises,
reaches a climax, and declines. The picture as a whole warrants
the most sanguine faith in God and in His purpose for man.
In detail it does not justify either fatuous optimism or humanistic meliorism. Contrary to the favorite assertion of the late
J. H, Breasted, man has not raised himself by his own boot
straps.
82 Every human culture has risen and has fallen in its
turn; every human pattern has faded out after its brief season
of success. It is only when the historian compares successive
configurations of society that the fact of real progress makes
itself apparent. Nothing could be farther from the truth than the facile belief
that God only manifests Himself in progress, in the improve
ment of standards of living, in the spread of medicine and the
reform of abuses, in the diffusion of organized Christianity.
The reaction from this type of theistic meliorism, which a few
years ago had almost completely supplanted the faith of Moses,
Elijah, and Jesus among modern Christians, both Protestant
and Catholic, is now sweeping multitudes from their religious
moorings. Real spiritual progress can only be achieved through
catastrophe and suffering, reaching new levels after the pro
found catharsis which accompanies major upheavals. Every
such period of mental and physical agony, while the old is
being swept away and the new is still unborn, yields different
social patterns and deeper spiritual insights. Our own age is
witnessing a true catharsis which will, we believe, bring pro
found spiritual rebirth and will prevent man from destroying
himself, as man has every apparent intention of doing.
Several hundred thousand years after primitive man had
begun to make his first artifacts, and a little over two thousand
years ago, Greek civilization reached its climax. Between 450
and 100 B. C. Hellenic thinkers formulated all the elements
of modern science, philosophy, and art, and Jewish thinkers
plumbed the depths of human relationship to God. However,
just before man's fumbling hands could make use of the power
ful new tools which were now at his disposal and just when



EPILOGUE 311
he should have entered a new era of progress, original intel
lectual activity practically ceased and further progress was
delayed for a millennium and a half. Meanwhile the civilized world had achieved unity and prosperity under Graeco-Roman
culture and Roman domination, only to discover that its material and intellectual life was so far ahead of its spiritual
development that the lack of integration became too great to permit further progress on the old lines. Jesus Christ appeared
on the scene just when occidental civilization had reached a
fatal impasse.
The civilization of that day was in many respects comparable
to what it is today. Philosophy ranged over just as wide fields
of speculation; men's religious attitudes varied from the loftiest ethical monotheism to the most benighted superstition, just as today. Moreover, the modern world had, a quarter of a century ago, almost achieved comparable unity under the sway of a cul
ture which was the lineal offspring of Graeco-Roman civiliza
tion; a few years later the same world achieved partial unity of political life under the League of Nations; there seemed to
be no end to mechanical progress or to the advance of knowl
edge, employing the tools which had been forged so successfully
by the Greeks. Yet today we see Occidental civilization totter
ing; we see intellectual activity declining with unexampled
speed over a large part of the globe; we see a sensational re
vival of such pseudo-sciences as astrology (Babylonian in origin), Neo-Gnosticism ("New Thought" in all its varied
forms), racial mysticism, etc.; we see scientific methods and discoveries judged by Marxist and racist gauges instead of by
independent scientific standards. In short, we are in a world which is strangely like the Graeco-Roman world of the first
century B. C. We need reawakening of faith in the God of the
majestic theophany on Mount Sinai, in the God of Elijah's
vision at Horeb, in the God of the Jewish exiles in Babylonia,
in the God of the Agony at Gethsemane . . .

88 The new microphotographic and petrographic methods were first systematically utilized by Kidder in his Pottery of Pecos (1931-36) and have been introduced into Near-Eastern studies by Mrs. Enrich in Early Pottery of the Jebeleh
Region (Philadelphia, 1939). These methods are now being extended and refined by Vladimir Fewkes in the laboratories of the University of Pennsylvania
Museum. New techniques of considerable importance are being developed by the ceramic department of the University of Pittsburgh, in collaboration with J. L. Kelso. 3 * The extent of their error was freely admitted by Watzinger in 1926 (Zeits. Deutsch. Morg. Ges., 80, pp. 131-36, and has since been recognized by all
specialists.

Gordon Childe, New Light on the Most Ancient East, London, 1934. Thanks
to cultural synchronisms it is now possible to establish far-reaching chronological parallelism between Egypt and Babylonia; cf. the latest syntheses by A. Scharff, Zeits. Aeg. Sprachet 11 (1935), pp. 87-106, and Historische Zeitschrift, 161 (1939), pp. 3-32.

1935), and The Origins of Early Semitic Ritual (London, 1938). While the

*7 Schroeder's classical treatment of the Hellenic and Indie materials in his
Mysterium und Mimus im Rigveda (Leipzig, 1908) has been remarkably illustrated and in part confirmed by the work of H. Zimmern (especially in his study
of texts relating to the "
passion of Bel-Marduk "
; cf . Zeits. Morg. Ges., 76, pp. 36-55) and K. Sethe (see his Dramatische Texte zu altagyptischen Mysterienspielen, Leipzig, 1928).
*8 The debate between Ullman and Carpenter must be decided in substantial
favor of the latter; cf. the writer's provisional observations, Pal Expl. Fund Quar. State., 1936, p. 213, where the proposed date "in the ninth century"
may be lowered to " about 800 B. C. or a little later." Mr. John V. Walsh
is now engaged in preparing a detailed study of the problem. Ullman's arguments are both epigraphkally and historically fallacious ; Carpenter's essential arguments
are correct, but we must substitute " current cursive " for "
archaizing lapidary
"
script as the medium through which the borrowing took place.
49 For the strong reaction against hypercriticism cf. Tenney Frank, A History
of Rome (1923) and Proc, Am. Philos. Soc., 1931, pp. 193 ff.; Hugh Last in
Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. VII, Ch. XII (1928); Altheim, Epochen der romischen Geschichte (Frankfurt, 1934).
60 See Collingwood and Myres, Roman Britain and the English Settlements (Oxford, 1936), Ch. XIX, especially pp. 320-24. Recent volumes of Antiquity bear eloquent testimony to the increasing seriousness with which literary tradition is being regarded in England, in spite of the obviously imaginative character of most of the Arthurian legends.

58 The Assyriologist B. Landsberger and his pupils have been inclined to exaggerate the amount of literary fabrication in early Babylonia. The admirable monograph by H. G. Giiterbock, Die historische Tradition . . . (Zeits. f. Assyr., 42, 1934,
g PP- 1-91) goes too far in this direction; for example, it is unlikely
that the inscription of Lugal-anne-mundu of Adab is a later fabrication, and
most of the supposed anachronisms vanish if we suppose that this king really
lived in the late Accad or even the Guti period; cf. Th. Jacobsen, The Sumerian
King List (Chicago, 1939), pp. 102, 138 ff. On the other hand, it is clear that many texts of the so-called naru type are essentially historical romances.
6 *Cf. Jour. Asiat., llth series, Vol. 6, pp. 101-117.
55 The best illustration of this practice will be found in the elaborate critical edition of Ch. 17 of the Book of the Dead by H. Grapow, Religiose Urkunden,
56 In this connection it may be interesting to note that the late H. M, Wiener,
who was in his day one of the pillars of the Mosaic theory of Pentateuchal origins, once told the writer that, in his opinion, not over one-third of the Jaws
attributed to Moses actually came from him, the other two-thirds consisting of
later commentary, glosses, and the results of court decisions.
57 The Assyrian Laws, Oxford, 1935, pp. 12-15 and passim. The formulation
of the authors is too drastic; cf. San Nicol6, Or. Lit.-zeit., 1936, cols. 5l4f.



NOTES TO CHAPTER II 317
NOTES TO CHAPTER II
I The use of the term "
positivistic
" for this school is an extension of the original sense of the term, as used by Comte of his own philosophy; this extension has become general in current German writing (cf. the writer's observations
in his presidential addresses, Jour. Am. Or. Soc., 56 [1936], pp. 122 ff., and
Jour. Bib. Lit., LIX [1940], p. 97). Among philosophers generally there is a current tendency to employ the term with reference to the nineteenth-century rational-empiric attitude to reality; cf., e.g., C. H. Kaiser in the Journal of Philosophy, June 20, 1940, pp. 3 37 if., passim.
* Theologie des Alien Testaments, Vol. I, p. 5 ; cf. the writer, Jour. Bib. Lit., LIX, p. 96.
8 Reason and Nature, New York, 1931, pp. 369-85. This chapter was, however, written in 1913 (p. 369, n. 1) and it reflects the anti-historical bias of contemporary American thinking, going so far as to say (p. 370), "the more
developed a science is the less use it makes of history." He goes on to say:
" Thus history has no applications in mathematical investigations, and next to
none in physical researches." Of course not! Mathematics is simply a body of abstract and symbolical forms of logic, divorced as far as possible from non
mathematical considerations. By "
physical researches " Cohen was undoubtedly thinking mainly of investigations in mathematical physics, where mathematics
reigns supreme. On the other hand, the importance of the historical perspective to the scientist is being increasingly recognized and is practically illustrated by the rapid growth of attention to the history of the sciences in this country. Since
" scientific method " is only the result of accumulated and systematized experience, it cannot be divorced from the history of that experience without fatal results. The innumerable references to facts derived from the history of science and philosophy in the body of Cohen's work form the best antidote for the statements just quoted. Cf. also his instructive analyses of Jewish philosophies of history in his article in Jewish Social Studies, I (1939), pp. 39-72. ^Studien zur Geschichte der wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Verh'dltnisse . . .

21 The philosophical contrasting of " History " and " Nature " seems to go back to J. G. Droysen (cf. E. Rothacker, Historische Zeitschrift, 161 [1939],
pp. 84-92). It has been ingeniously applied to Hebrew and Jewish history by
S. W. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews, especially Vol. I, pp. 3-32 (cf. the review by Canon H. Danby, Jour. Bib. Lit., 56 [1937], 395 ff.).
As we have tried to show, however, there is no such ontological dualism as History Nature. It would be idle to deny that history and nature may often be
advantageously contrasted, or that they frequently exhibit a real polarity, but
aesthetic or adventitious dichotomies of this type cannot be made the framework for a systematic philosophy of history. Since writing these lines I have read the illuminating article of R. Anthes in Zeits. Deutscb. Morg. Ges., 92 (1938), pp. 421-440, in which the latter presents some very sound objections to the con
trasting of " Nature " and " History " as done by W. Wolf in his Wesen und Wert der Agyptologie (Leipzig, 1937). The point of view reflected by Anthes' paper is closely related to mine. My attitude to most of the philosophical tendencies criticized in this chapter is generally in accord with the neo-scholastic point of view as stated, e. g., by Ludovico D. Macnab (El concepto escolastico de la bistoria, Buenos Aires, 1940, especially pp. 83ff.). However, there is no formal contact between my rational empiricism in dealing with historical problems and the methods of scholastic philosophy, which moves in a different sphere and deals with theological problems which lie beyond the scope of this book.
NOTES TO CHAPTER III
1 The term " Ceramolithic " was suggested by the writer some years ago to designate the period when stone and pottery were used together (cf. G. E.
Wright, The Pottery of Palestine . . . , New Haven, 1937, p. 4) and has had limited success, but it is better to adhere for the present to more generally recognized classifications.

and G. A. Barton, Proc. Am. Pbftos. Soc., 82 (1940), pp. 134fT., who limits
himself to Anglo-American literature. The authority of Schuchhardt, Alteuropa,
2nd ed. (Berlin, 1926), pp. 27-31, inclines Lehmann to leave the question of religious or secular purpose open; Barton, on the other hand, decides without reserve for the religious interpretation, to which Mme. Passemard also inclines.

Striking parallels from the later Near East, still unknown to these scholars, tip the balance definitively in favor of the latter; see especially Mallowan, Iraq, III, p. 20, and the writer, Melanges . . . Dussattd (Paris, 1939), p. 119.

Age, New Haven, 1937, and the table on p. 107. On the chronology of the
Ghassulian, over which a bitter debate raged for a number of years, see now the observations of A. Bea and R. Koeppel in Teleilat Ghassul II (Rome, 1940), pp. v, 50, which show that there is now practical unanimity, ]our. Pal. Or. Soc., XVII (1937), pp. 15-30.

16 Cf. the writer's discussion, Ann. Am. Sch. Or. Res., VI (1926), pp. 67-74,
which is now out of date, but which has been proved strikingly correct in its main contentions. 18 See Sydney Smith, Alalakh and Chronology, London, 1940, especially pp. 1 ff., 26 ff., 48 f.; the writer, Bull Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 77, pp. 25-30, No. 78, p. 23, n. 1; A. Ungnad, Arch. f. Orientf., XIII, pp. 145 f. The synchronism between Egypt and Babylonia by way of Byblus and Mari which the writer has
pointed out, squares perfectly with the astronomical chronology set up by Smith and Sewell, on the basis of the Venus observations of the Babylonian king Ammisaduqa; Hammurabi would then have reigned 1792-1750 B. C. and the end of the First Dynasty of Babylon would fall about 1595. It must be em
phasized that the now available material makes this chronology certain with a maximal error of not over a generation probably less on either side.

21 The older literature on the Amorite question, including Clay's Amurru (1909) and The Empire of the Amorites (1919), is so completely out of date
that it cannot be used at all. The new material from Mari now enables us to see the scattered data previously known in their true perspective.

320 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
Historiscbe Zeitscbrift, 161 (1939), pp. 3-32, covers the ground adequately from
the Egyptian point of view. Farina's renewed study of the Turin Papyrus has
demonstrated that Eduard Meyer was wrong in reading the length of the Eleventh Dynasty as 242 years (Die altere Cbronologie Babyloniens, Assyriens
und Agyptens, 1925, pp. 63 F.). The writer has become more and more con
vinced of the correctness of his estimate of the length of the period covered
by the first eleven dynasties, which he published provisionally in Ann. Am. Sch.
Or. Res., VI (1926), pp. 72 f., according to which Menes would fall between 3000 and 2800 and may most safely be dated about 2900 B. C.

There can be no doubt that Beth went too far in his enthusiasm and introduced dynamistic conceptions into many expressions and passages where they do not belong. Grapow's criticism of his
Egyptological competence was also quite justified. On the other hand, Grapow showed an amazing dogmatism and inability to see the nature of the problem with which Beth was grappling. In these investigations both philological competence and training in the history of religion and ethnology are needed; cf. the writer's observations about the successful collaboration of the two disciplines in another case (Jour. Bib. Lit., 1940, p. 86).

*A The subject of divine triads in the ancient Near East, particularly Arabia and Syria, has been discussed repeatedly by D. Nielsen, especially in his books Die altarabische Mondreligion (1904), Der dreieinige Gott in religionsgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung (1922), and in his paper "Die altsemitische Muttergottin," Zeits. Deutsch. Morg. Ges., 1938, pp. 526-551. Owing to Nielsen's strong
tendency to over-schematize and to a certain onesidedness in dealing with the material, his work has been only moderately successful and must be used with great caution.
*5 The close relation between the ideas of tabu and of holiness was shown in classical form by Robertson Smith, The Religion of the Semites (new ed., 1894),
pp. 446-454. The best illustration of the interpenetration of these concepts is found in the various meanings of the stem farm in Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew:
Arabic haram means " what is tabu," both because it is illicit or because it is
particularly sacred; Jiaram and hartm mean also " sacred precincts "; haram means
"
illicit, improper," even " abominable." In Hebrew the denominative verb
hefyrtm means both " to devote something to destruction as abominable " and
" to consecrate something to God as sacred." An excellent illustration is offered
by the stem w*b, which means " to purify " in Egyptian whereas in Hebrew the
derived noun td*ebah means " negative tabu, abomination "
; the original sense
of the root may be preserved partly in Arabic wa*aba, " to taice (something) entirely," i.e., to have something intact or unsullied (Latin intactus, integer). "See above, n. 35. *7 For the pronunciation ku 1 see the writer's treatment in his book The Vocali
zation of the Egyptian Syllabic Orthography (New Haven, 1934), pp. 26, 61. The best discussion of the nature of the ku from the standpoint of Egyptology is still the paper of SteindorfT, Zeits. Ag. Spr., 48 (1910), pp. 152-59; the best treatment from the point of view of comparative religion has been given by Van der Leeuw, ibid., 54 (1918), pp. 56-64 (and in Jour. Eg. Archaeol, V, p. 64). For the most recent expert statement see H. Kees, Kulturgeschichte des Alien Orients: Agypten (Munich, 1933), pp. 319 f., where a bibliography of the pertinent literature will also be found.
"See the writer's observations, Jour. Bib. Lit,, XXIX, pp. 150f.; Jour. Soc.
Or. Res., VII, p. 79; Jour. Am. Or. Soc., 54, p. 121, n. 48. A thorough up-todate study of this Sumero-Accadian conception is very much needed
49 For an admirable discussion of this figure and his original role as the head
of the Indo-European pantheon see M. Nilsson, Arch. Rel., XXXV (1938),
pp. 156fT. It is still uncertain whether the name Dyeus is ultimately the same
as the common noun deiwos (deus), "god." If the words are identical we should have an excellent parallel to Semitic el,
" god," and El, " head of the divine hierarchy." The root-meaning of the Indo-European words connects them
with heaven through the concept of " light
"
; the original meaning of the Semitic
word was undoubtedly " strong."



322 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
50 This statement applies even to so careful and penetrating a study as that of K. Sethe, Urgeschichte und alteste Religion der Agypter (Leipzig, 1930),
which is a valuable corrective to the fantasies of earlier Egyptologists but goes much too far in correlating the evolution of Egyptian religion with the hypo
thetical development of Egyptian political organization.
"For the latest treatment see Breasted, The Dawn of Conscience (1933), pp. 29-42, where the most important literature is mentioned.
53 The abstract terms " to come into existence " and " to cause to come into existence" are common in Egyptian religious literature from the Pyramid Texts
on down and there is no reason to deny them a still greater antiquity. Moreover, it is hardly likely that these concepts possessed even an empirico-logical
connotation in the Egyptian mind. In other words, they do not answer the
question " how? " or " why? " but simply " what was the first thing to happen? "

5* See Breasted, op. tit., pp. 223 ff., where we find the best and most recent account of this socio-religious revolution, based largely on the Coffin Texts, which are now being edited for the first time by the Oriental Institute of the
University of Chicago.
55 For the most recent light on the progress attained by Egyptian mathematics
in the Middle Empire see S. Gands, Proc. Am. Acad. Jew. Res., IX (1939), pp.
13f., on a remarkable text from the nineteenth century B. C. The great Rhind Papyrus was written in the seventeenth century but was copied, according to its
colophon, from an original of the nineteenth century. On Egyptian mathematics, with full references to the work of Peet, Struve, and Neugebauer since 1920, see Kees, op. cit. (1933), pp. 291 rT.
56 On this material see also Meek, University of Toronto Quarterly, VIII (1939), pp. 187 f. The Ur data, which Meek does not mention, were published by E. Burrows in his Archaic Texts (Philadelphia, 1935), pp. 19 if.

58 See Langdon, Oxford Editions of Cuneiform Inscriptions, I (1923), p. 50. Langdon's translation of line 4 is grammatically impossible; the writer's changes follow the rules stated by A. Poebel, Sumerische Grammatik (1923), 147, 626, and p. 302.
69 See Am. Jour. Sem. Lang., XXXVI (1920), p. 262. Unfortunately, no

new Sumerian text from Nippur published by S. Kramer in Bull. Am. Scb. Or. Res., No. 79 (1940).
61 Langdon's Tammuz and Ishtar (Oxford, 1914), though inaccurate in detail
and now antiquated in many respects, remains the best account of the cult of
Tammuz and related figures in Babylonia. Progress in the interpretation of the
difficult dialectic Sumerian hymns and dirges belonging to the Tammuz cycle
has not been very rapid, in spite of the efforts of Witzel and Frank; it is to be hoped that Poebel and his pupils will soon attack this important body of
material. The writer's point of view, though slightly antiquated in detail, has
not been appreciably modified since he wrote " The Goddess of Life and Wis
dom" (Am. Jour. Sem. Lang., XXXVI, pp. 258-294) ; cf. also Jour. Bib. Lit.,

were not wholly unknown, however, as we now know from the Mari correspondence, which shows that horses were in demand for use in drawing chariots early in the eighteenth century. However, negative evidence from Western-Asiatic sources makes it certain that they were still used very sparingly at that time. It is probable that chariots were still too cumbersome to be of much practical utility in warfare. By the sixteenth century all had changed and horse-drawn chariots dominated the military scene completely.

*8 The writer has maintained this interpretation of the word komer for many
years (cf. Proc. Am. Philos. Soc., 1930, p. 450), but has never had occasion to
defend it in detail. A few illustrations of the available evidence must suffice. In the Old-Assyrian tablets from Cappadocia the word is used constantly (kum
rum, kumra) in the sense of " member of a class of priest

(J. Lewy, Rev.
Hist. ReL, CX [1934], pp. 46 f.). It is there used as synonym of Accadian pastsu (Ulf-ME), as shown by Lewy (Archives d'Histoire de Droit Oriental, II, 1938, p. 124) ; patisu is a regular appellation of Tammuz, notably in a
passage where the latter appears particularly akin to Attis and Adonis (cf. Am.
Jour. Sem. Lang., XXXV, pp. 180ff.), and may thus have some such meaning
as "
gallus." In the light of the certain connection between the cult of the goddess Kubaba(t) and the galli (Albright, Arch. Orientf., V, pp. 230 f., Bull.
Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 78, pp. 26 f., n. 21; Benveniste, Melanges Dussaud, I, pp. 249 ff.), the kumrum of Kubabat (Lewy, loc. cit.) was presumably the pro
totype of Greek kybebos, " gallus." The fact that a kumrum might have a son
is no objection, since adoption was exceedingly common at that time and parallels
from Mesopotamia are easy to adduce. In the Amarna Letters the related word
kamiru means "eunuch" (Jour. Am. Or. Soc., 35, p. 394). About 600 B.C. two grave-stelae of priests of the moon-god Shahar at Neirab in Syria exhibit the priests (called kumra in both cases) as beardless, in striking contrast to the
usual practice of the day in representing men. In Syriac kumra acquires the
sense of "
priest
" in general.

6* The name of this people in cuneiform was formerly read Khabiru, but since the sign BI also had the reading pi and since Semitic 'ayin is generally transcribed as & in cuneiform the reading "Apiru has been maintained by the writer since 1930; see The Archaeology of Palestine and the Bible (New York, 1932

in Ugaritic (cf. Bull Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 77, p. 32), combined with the recognition that the name appears as 'a-pi-ru in Egyptian transcription (Albright,
Vocalization of the Egyptian Syllabic Orthography [New Haven, 1934], p. 42,

58 Cf. Jour. Eg. Arch., X (1924), pp. 7f. The writer has long planned to
discuss the name " Goshen," which is non-Egyptian in form, since Eg. g (which is a voiceless-unaspirated stop, Worrell, Coptic Sounds, pp. 17 ff.) was heard by Semites as q\ cf. Heb. qeseth, "scribal palette," from Eg. gsf and qoph,
" baboon," from Eg. g'f. Suffice it to say that " Goshen " also reappears as a place-name in southern Palestine and that the element gus appears as the first part of a number of compound place-names in northern Palestine and Syria; its
original meaning seems to have been "mound (of earth)," Heb. gus, Axab. juthwah.

63 On the meaning of the name " Shaddai " see the writer's discussion, ibid., pp. 180-193, to which important additions can now be made, rendering the
philological explanation of the name inexpugnable. We now know, for example,
that the adjectival-gentilic formation in question was common among the
Amorites of the Upper Euphrates valley in the early second millennium. A
number of good additional parallels to the formation of the name itself can also be adduced from Accadian. E. Burrows' posthumous paper (Jour. Theol Stud,, XLI, 1940, pp. 152-161) is antiquated.

71 Since the writer may not publish his treatment of this subject for some time,
a few indications are called for. The word pahid, pafyd originally meant "
thigh, hip, loins," as shown by Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic cognates with this
meaning. In Palmyrene pahda means " family, clan, tribe " and in Arabic fahid
is said by the native lexicographers to mean " a small branch of a tribe con
sisting of a man's nearest kin "
; in North Canaanite (Ugaritic) pfyd means
"flock" (Dan'el, II, 5, lines 17, 23: 'emr b-pfyd = " lamb from the flock").
78 Cf. S. A. Cook, Jour. Bib. Lit., LI (1932), p. 275 and n. 3.
73 For the Cimmerians see the observations and references of J. Wiesner in Der Alte Orient, 38: 2-4 (1939), p. 75; for the Scythians see J. Przyluski,

7i The tenth century B. C. is accidentally the date assigned by A. Hermann, in his fanciful book on Die Erdkarte der Bibel (Braunschweig, 1931; cf. H.
Philipp in the Philologiscbe Wochenschrift, 1932, cols. 175-80), to the "Phoe
nician " map of the world which is supposed to have become the nucleus of
Hebrew cosmography. It is very significant that the Arab tribes listed in Gen. X are almost entirely different from the tribes known to us from the Assyrian inscriptions of the eighth and seventh centuries, as well as from the Sabaean and Minaean inscriptions of slightly later date. The writer formerly dated the
bulk of the material in Gen. X about the end of the eighth century (cf. Recent
Discoveries in Bible Lands, New York, 1936, p. 25), but the weight of the evidence is against so late a date.
75 H. L. Ginsberg has made a very interesting stylistic comparison between the Priestly Code and the oldest Aramaic papyrus from Egypt (515 B.C.); cf.
Jour. Bib. Lit., LIX (1940), p. x.
78 G. B. Gray's careful study in his Studies in Hebrew Proper Names (London, 1896), pp. 190 f., has proved to be completely misleading, since his evidence was still almost exclusively biblical and there were few extra-biblical sources which might have enabled him to control his statistical deductions about the
probability of early occurrence of certain types. F. Hommers treatment m Die
altisraelitische Vberlieferung (Munich, 1897), pp. 298 fT., though much less critical, was based on original extra-biblical sources and has proved to be correct
in principle, though wrong in many details. M. Noth takes a somewhat cautious intermediate position in Die israelitischen Personennamen (Stuttgart, 1928), pp.
7 f., but our material has increased greatly in the past twelve years and we need no longer be so cautious.

'
Offspring(?) of the goddess(?)'[ ]." Note that in Keret, line 25, the word yr also means "offspring (of a woman)."
84 Among the latest ideas are Mowinckel's explanation as ya huwa, (O He,
O That One!) and A. Lukyn Williams's Ya-hd (supposed to be a solemn cry
of some kind). Very extraordinary from the linguistic point of view is K. G.
Kuhn's contention that the original form of the name was Yaw (Orientalische
Studien [LJttmann Festschrift], Leiden, 1935, pp. 25-42), with Littmann's own suggestion that the name is derived from Indo-European Dyeus (Zeus). There is much useful material for the history of the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton in the article by O. Eissfeldt in Zeits. Alttest. Wiss., 53 (1935), pp. 5976, but it needs critical philological sifting. For example, it is quite certain that the Babylonian writing ya-a-ma reflects a pronunciation you at the end of a theophorous compound; for the phonetic rules in question see C. H. Gordon,
Arch. f. Orientf. XII (1938), p. 110, 17-18, 20. Moreover, as C. H. Gordon has pointed out to me, the writing Yhbyh in the Jewish incantations of the
seventh century A. D. means YH-b-YH, i. e., it is a kind of " exponential "
strengthening of the Tetragrammaton.

The constantly swelling material from Syria and northwestern Mesopotamia in the eighteenth century, from Ugarit and other sites some centuries later, from new documents such as the Egyptian Execration Texts, etc., yield no clear examples of the name Sin; the Canaanite name of this god was Yerah, not Sin. 90 Cf. the discussion of biblical anthropomorphism by W.

this subject.
95 It is true that many scholars date the introduction of the seventh-day rest into Israel much later, but their evidence is most unsatisfactory. Quite aside from the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian seventh-day tabus, which have been frequently discussed in recent years, is the undoubted fact that the Egyptians
divided the month into four parts, each of which was named djn't, literally
"
part," from the Pyramid Age on down. Moreover, the tabu against travelling on certain lunar feasts goes back to a very early age in Israel, as will be shown
by one of my pupils.
96 See above, n. 30. On the etymology of Heb. torah and the denominative
origin of hdra, "to teach," see Jour. Bib. Lit., XLVI (1927), pp. 182 8. Some
details of my demonstration must now be modified, but these changes do not affect my thesis at all.
97 It is, of course, by no means unlikely that the triumph of Yahweh over the dragon was known in early Israel; our point is that it did not become part of
the normative doctrine of Yahwism until later times. 98 For some further observations which are pertinent in this connection see the
writer's remarks, Jour Bib. Lit., LIX (1940), pp. 91-96 and 110-112, especially p. 112. The latest study of Israelite monotheism, Bruno Ballscheit's Alter und Aufkommen des Monotheismus in der israelitischen 'Religion (Berlin, 1938) is very disappointing, though he has some excellent observations on the use of
such terms as " henotheism," not to mention "
practical monotheism " and "monolatry" (pp. 10 f.) as well as on the character of later Israelite monotheism. However, he completely fails to understand the nature of ancient Near
Eastern, especially Canaanite, conceptions with regard to the nature and scope of their deities. The first scholar (aside perhaps from the present writer) to recognize the nature of Canaanite religion in this respect is O. Eissfeldt (Zeits. Alttest. Wiss., 1939, pp. 14 ff., especially p. 15).

Alttest. Wiss., 1935, p. 202. The probability is that the actual course of events was closer to the biblical tradition than any of our critical reconstructions have been, and that some vital clues still elude our search.



330 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
2 For the latest treatment of the poetic sagas reflected by the citations from the
"Book of Jashar," etc., see S. Mowinckel, Zeits. Ahtest. Wiss., 53 (1935), pp. 130-152. As usual Mowinckel offers some original and helpful suggestions, but his date for the collected material (after the Assyrian invasion of 738 B. C.) and his attempts to relate it to J and E are not acceptable.
8 See Chap. VI, pp. 266 f., for the date of the Book of Jubilees. *For the writer's view see Bull. Am. Scb. Or. Res., No. 35 (1929), p. 6, and
against it see Abel, Rev. Bib., 1925, pp. 208 ff., 1936, pp. 106 f.; S. Klein, Zeits. Deutsch. Pal. Ver., 1934, pp. 7 ff. Abel and Klein defend the theory that the stories preserved in Jubilees refer to the Maccabaean wars which date a century or more after the probable time at which the Book of Jubilees was written !
8 See Chap. IV, n. 54.
6 See the writer, Ann. Am. Scb. Or. Res., VI (1926), pp. 35 f. and n. 73; A. Rowe, The Topography and History of Betb-shan (Philadalphia, 1930), pp. 29 f. In the years 1924-25 the writer spent many hours before the stela, trying to determine its exact reading in line 10, but the surface is too weathered for
certainty. The signs
' and py are dear; the final rw (Rowe: r) is probable; the
determinatives are clear. In the following groups we can be certain of the words
t of the mountain of Y[ ] " and of the following determinative; it is probable that the third sign of the name is d but Rowe's Yrd[n\ can hardly be correct. It is certain that the name 'A-pi-ru (or
c
-p/> ) is phonetically identical with the name formerly read "Khabiru," as noted above; see already the writer, Vocali
zation of the Egyptian Syllabic Orthography (New Haven, 1934), p. 42, VII B. 4. 7 For details see especially Bull. Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 74 (1939), pp. 15-23.

9 In view of the continuous influence exerted by Egyptian culture and organization on Palestine in these centuries, as long emphasized by Alt and his pupils
(see now also R. de Vaux, Rev. Bib., 1939, pp. 394-405, who stresses it for the tenth century B. C.) it would scarcely be surprising to find that the triumph of
the high-priests of Amun and the establishment of their " theocracy " about
1080 B.C. had repercussions in Israel. On the nature of Hrihor's victory and the attendant circumstances see especially H. Kees, Heribor und die Aufricbtung des tbebanischen Gottesstaates (Gottingen, 1936).

" be base, vile," and the partially assimilated hbt, "be low, lowly, humble"; Can. hpt represents a very common type of partial assimilation of the middle voiced to the adjacent voiceless consonants.
14 On the site of Ophrah see most recently the writer, four. Pal. Or. Soc., XI, pp. 248-251, and Abel, Jour. Pal. Or. Soc., XVII, pp. 31-44. Both views, however divergent they may be in detail, place Ophrah in districts peculiarly exposed to Canaanite influences.

25 For the fullest discussion of this question see Dussaud, op. cit., pp. 159 ff. (with a contribution by I. Levy) . It should be added that the word qrr seems first to appear in the Twentieth Dynasty (Sethe apud Burchardt, Altkanaanaische
Fremdworte, ad voc.), though it remained rare until much later, and that the word has been adapted to the native Egyptian verbal stem qrrt "to burn," known since the Pyramid Age.
28 See now J. Morgenstern, Heb. Un. Col. Ann., XIV (1939), pp. 76-126, and the writer's comments, Jour. Bib. Lit., 1940, p. 300. *7 There was undoubtedly much more exegesis of the Hebrew text in preexilic
times than we often realize. Sometimes we can follow the operation of exegetical considerations in our text, e.g., in Gen. 3: 1 ff. (see F. M. Th. Bohl, Genesis, I, Groningen, 1923, pp. 68 f.).
28 Univ. Toronto Quar., VIII (1939), p. 196; see Budde, Jour. Bib. Lit., XL (1921), pp. 41 f.
29 There is no question that this was also the later exegesis of the First Com
mandment (Greek: plen emu, Targum: bar minnl, " except me "), but since this use of *al panai was unique, not all exegetes agreed, as shown by Jerome's coram
me, followed by the English Bible: " before me." The original sense was, how
ever, more concrete: " Thou shalt not prefer other gods to me." This rendering agrees with the clear sense of 'al panai in several other passages (e. g., Gen. 50: 1, II Kings 13: 14, and especially Deut. 21: 16 and Gen. 16: 12). Since Yahweh had no pantheon, no other deities could be associated with him anyway, but a rebellious Israelite might deliberately choose to worship another god. Jews and Christians have recited this commandment for twenty-five centuries without supposing that there actually were other gods in existence as rivals of God,
and there is no more reason to credit the Israelites with henotheistic or monolatrous ideas when they recited it. The emphasis is laid on the legalistic aspect
of the Commandment, which concerns itself with what men may do, not on the
ontological aspect, which requires development beyond the empirico-logical stage
of thought. Early Yahwistic theologians were doubtless in a position to answer



332 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
the question " Is there any god besides Yahweh in the cosmos ? " if it had been
put to them, but we have no reason to suppose that anyone thought of asking it for example, who would then have thought of asking
" Does the world in
which we live really exist? "

Both among Canaanites and Israelites three-year-old bulls were sacrificed as particularly pleasing to deity; cf. A. Rowe, The Topography and History of Beth-shan (Phil
adelphia, 1930), p. 13, and E. A. Speiser, Bull Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 72, pp. 15-17. ** Die Profeten (Leipzig, 1914), pp. 129-143.
35 A. Guillaume, in his Prophecy and Divination (London, 1938) has stressed the relationship of the Hebrew seer to the Mesopotamian diviner, but has exaggerated its significance.

A very interesting seal from the early second millennium, discovered in a thir
teenth-century stratum at Beth-shan, bears the legend "Manum the baru, the servant of Ea." 8T The etymology is original with the writer (barring correction). For the latest statement of the usual etymology see Guillaume, op. cit., pp. 112f., but his formulation of the case does not strengthen it at all. There is no basis for
E. Ebeling's rendering of na-bit ilani1^ as " Prophetin der Gotter "
(Mitt. Vord. Ges., 25 [19183, p. 52, top of page [line 23] ) ; the word nabtt is clearly archaic for nibtt (cf. the parallel ba'tt, "sought of"), "the one called (by the gods),
(their) favorite." Four lines previously in the same text occurs the phrase na-ba-at
ta-bi-ni, "she who creates (lit. names) the multitude" (contrast Ebeling and for the meaning of tabinu see the material collected by Mullo Weir, Lexicon of Accadian Prayers [London, 1934], pp. 357 f.).

The word which appears as se-lu-tu, supposed to mean some kind of female
priest, is otherwise unknown and is probably a mistake for se-ib-tu,
" old
woman "
; for old women as experts in Hittite ritual and divinatory lore see A.
Goetze, The Hittite Rjtual of Tunnawi (New Haven, 1938), and the writer's
comments, Jour. Bib. tit., 1940, p. 316 (with regard to the " witch of Endor *').



NOTES TO CHAPTER V 333
40 On the historical background of the Greek stories see now Dodds, Haw. Theol. Rev., 1940, pp. 155-176. In culture there was so close a relationship between Macedonia and Thrace on the one hand, and Asia Minor on the other, that his emphasis on eventual Macedonian origin does not affect the validity of the Anatolian theory.
"This aspect of the prophetic experience has been correctly emphasized by
J. Hempel in his essay " Berufung und Bekehrung "
(Beerjestschrift, Stuttgart, 1935, pp. 41 flf.) ; cf. Hempel in Der Alte Orient, 38 (1938): 1, p. 23.
*a Cf. the writer's observations about the historical background of the shift
from ecstatic to rhapsodic prophetism in the article cited above, n. 38.
48 Eissfeldt's discussion of the Baal of Jezebel (Zeits. Altest. Wiss., 57, 1939, pp. 19 ff.) is correct in emphasizing the cosmic sweep and the prestige of this
deity, but can hardly be correct in identifying it so specifically with Ba'al-shamem,
" the Lord of Heaven." That the Baal in question was identified with Ba'al
shamem may be considered as virtually certain, just as the Ishtar of Nineveh was identified with the Ishtar of Arbela. However, the dominating traits of Melcarth were probably chthonic; the Baal of Tyre was lord of the storm but
he was also lord of the underworld and of its fertility-producing powers. It must be remembered that Baal spent some time every year in the underworld and that even such a chthonic divinity as Nergal was also originally a storm-god
(Nin-girsu, etc.).
** We have carefully avoided the misleading term " mystical communion "
;
see J. Lindblom for an exceedingly clear statement of the reasons why Israelite prophetic experience cannot be identified with the unio mystica (Zeits. Alttest.
Wiss., 1940, pp. 65-74. On the other hand, such recent writers as Hempel, Heschel, Tor Andrae, and others are fully justified in recognizing a certain kinship to mysticism in the prophetic experience. The Israelite prophet identified
his utterance with the command of Yahweh, much as the mediaeval Christian mystic identified his sufferings with the sufferings of Christ and received the
impression of the stigmata on his own person. The more extreme forms of
mysticism among Christians, Jews, Moslems, but especially among Brahmans and Buddhists of the Middle East, where the mystic becomes one with God, have no
counterpart in Israelite religious experience, so far as we know.

Lindblom, Lunds Universitetes Arsskrijt, N.F., Avd. 1, Vol. 34, No. 3 (1938), pp. 91-100, but he has certainly begun his reasoning at the wrong end, i. e., he should start with the altar of incense itself and not with theoretical considerations.

334 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
52 After a period of extreme skepticism with regard to the authenticity of the
ostensibly early Israelite eschatological predictions (mostly introduced by the words, "in that day") there has been a reaction, led by H. Gressmann in his
Ursprung der israelitisch-judiscben Escbatologie (1905), followed by T. H.
Robinson and J. Hempel (see his discussion in Gott und Menscb im Alien Testa
ment, second ed., 1936, pp. 27, 247 fl, etc.).
68 The writer still believes in the "two-campaign" theory of Sennacherib's
invasion of Judah; cf. Jew. Quar. Rev., XXIV (1934), pp. 370 f.
5 * On the chronology of this period see the writer's observations, Jour. Bib.
Lit., LI (1932), pp. 84 ff., with which such dates as are given by S. Mowinckel
in his monograph in Acta Orientalia, X (1932), pp. 161-277, passim, coincide.
66 Cf. Bull Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 47 (1932), pp. 12-14; No. 61 (1936), pp. 15 f.
"See especially Landsberger and Bauer, Zeits. f. Assyr., XXXVII (1926),
pp. 88-98, where previous literature is cited and criticized. On the general
situation see also the remarks of W. von Soden in his paper, Zeits. Alttest. Wiss., 1935, pp. 81-89.
67 See Forschungen und Fortschritte, 14, pp. 251 f. (reprinted in Eissfeldt,
Ras Schamra und Sanchunjaton, Halle, 1939, pp. 67-71). A date in the sixth century is not, however, excluded. If Porphyry and his source, Philo Byblius, are correct in attributing also to Sanchuniathon the authorship of a history based on previous work by Hierombalos priest of the god leuo in the time of Abibalos
king of Berytus, it may be observed that the latter name was particularly common among Phoenician kings of the tenth (Abibaal of Tyre and his namesake of Byblus) and of the seventh century (Abibaal of Arvad and his namesake of Shamshimoron [Samsimuruna in cuneiform]), and that the priest's name presumably reflects Phoenician Yerem-ba*al (e would then be a copyist's error for o). The latter name occurs in the hypocoristic form Rmb*l in a Phoenician inscription from Abydos in Egypt, dating from about the fifth century B. C. (now republished by Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, III, p. 102); it is strictly parallel in form and meaning to Hebrew *Yerem-yabu (Jeremiah), on the etymology of
which see the correct observations of M. Noth (Die israelitiscben Personennamen,
p. 201). The Hebrew name is common in biblical and extra-biblical occurrences from the seventh-fifth centuries B. C. Our date for Sanchuniathon in the seventh or sixth century B. C. thus becomes still more plausible.
58 Cf. Z. Harris, Development of tbe Canaanite Dialects, New Haven, 1939, p. 97, n. 6. Archaizing is, however, seldom consistent, as may be seen by examining late Egyptian and Babylonian texts.
69 See the provisional observations, Bull. Am. Scb. Or. Res., No. 73 (1939),

61 For a translation see Ebeling in Altor. Texte (Tubingen, 1926), pp. 283 f.
The writer would identify the last three kings of the middle column on the "first" side of the tablet with the last three kings of the Third Dynasty of
Babylon, since regnal years and political events agree perfectly. The following
restoration then refers to the Fourth Dynasty (Nebuchadrezzar I). The original text of these prophecies ex eventu may then belong to the eleventh century B. C.

336 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
10 According to Strabo (XVI, 2, 29) Philodemus was one of several distin
guished literary figures which came from " Gadara near Ascalon." Since the Gadara of the Decapolis (Muqeis) is far from Ascalon beyond Jordan, there has obviously been confusion of Gazara (Gezer) with Gadara. This confusion is very natural, since Heb. Gezer received the Aramaizing form Gedar (occurring as Gadara several times in Josephus, as pointed out by Schiirer, Gescbichte des
jiidischen Volkes*'6
, p. 339, n. 5) by a common back-formation (cf. Bib. Achzib, Gr. Ekdippa, now ez-Zib). Of course, Philodemus may have come from the other Gadara, but Gezer was still a flourishing town in the second century B. C, as we know from excavations. 11 Cf . Ingholt, Berytus, II, 92, and the writer, Bull. Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 66, p. 31. Aram, nahsa, Syr. nelisa meant properly
" omen, augury." 12 Such recent discoveries as the Lachish Ostraca and miscellaneous sealimpressions, etc., from the Persian period make it clear that the revival of preexilic script in Maccabaean coins after 135 B. C. (there were no bronze coins struck under Simon as formerly thought; see Sellers and the writer, Bull. Am. Sch. Or. Res., No. 43, p. 13, and H. Willrich, Zeits. Alttest. Whs., 51 [1933], pp. 78-9) was purely archaizing and does not represent a continued evolution of the current script, as in the case of Aramaic (for which see the writer's paper
on the Nash Papyrus, Jour. Bib. lit., LVI [1937], pp. 145-172). If we compare the oldest lapidary examples of Samaritan writing with the coins of the Hasmonaeans (for which see the convenient table in Narkiss, Coins of Palestine [Hebrew], Jerusalem, 1936), dated between 135 and 37 B.C., a relatively late date for the origin of the Samaritan script as such seems highly probable. Moreover, since Shechem and Samaria were conquered by the Jews between 128 and 110 B.C. and were lost to the Romans in 63 B.C., it would be only natural to date the final schism between the sects somewhere in the early first century B. C. It was presumably then or somewhat later that the entire Samaritan Pentateuch was retranscribed into the archaizing
" Samaritan "
script, which
symbolized the refusal of the Samaritans to follow the " modernists " of Jerusalem.

(La lettera di Aristea a Filocrate, Napoli, 1931; cf. A. Barrois, Rev. Bib., 1932, pp. 104-12) is too high, but is excused by the fact that Pseudo-Aristeas employed older materials; cf. L. H. Vincent, Rev. Bib., 1908, pp. 520 F., and 1909, pp. 555 fT. (on the topography of Jerusalem) and

Note also the present writer's observation that the list of Jewish names given by Pseudo-Aristeas in connection with the translation of the Septuagint contains authentic personal names of the third century and so may conceivably reproduce the membership of a real advisory body after all.

The application of Aristotelian methods to exegesis and hermeneutics was largely the work of Aristarchus of Samothrace (cir. 215-145 B. C), who reached the summit of his reputation at Alexandria cir. 150 B. C; he correctly stressed the importance of analogy in philology. The most important of his pupils and successors were the authors of the first Greek grammar, Dionysius Thrax (c. 166 B.C.) and Didymus (cir. 65 B. C-10 A.D.), a contemporary of Hillel.

bibliography is appended. His contention that Philo was actually member of a Jewish mystery-cult goes too far, and has not hitherto found any adherents in the ranks of specialists. 28tt These are not, of course, the only works of this age important for the understanding of Hellenistic Judaism, but they are the most important for our present purpose. For an interesting recent treatment of the bearing of the Sibylline Oracles on the ideology of the Jewish diaspora just before the time of Christ see J.

specialists in the Iranian field, H. H. Schaeder, and as Zaehner observes, even if many of the author's somewhat paradoxical conclusions rest on slender founda
tions, his work retains its fundamental value as a reconsideration of the entire subject by a very brilliant and learned scholar.

motif may go back ultimately to Egypt. The balance was also known in Babylonian and Elamite religion, where it played a similar part; cf. Meissner, Baby

balance is not " Shugurnak " but Shushinak, the chief god of Susa) .

86 There is now a vast literature dealing with the Mandaeans, which has been listed (up to 1930) by S. A. Pallis, Essay on Mandaean Bibliography (Copen
hagen, 1933). The soundest recent treatment of the subject is to be found in J. Thomas, Le mouvement baptists en Palestine et Syne (Gembloux, Belgium,
1935), pp. 186-267.
87 In his valuable study, Untersucbungen fiber den Ursprung der jobanneischen Theologie (Lund, 1939), E. Percy has attacked Bultmann and Bauer with great
vigor and success; cf. P. Benoit, Rev. Bib., 1940, pp. 259-64 and W. L. Knox, Jour. Theol. Stud., XLI (1940), pp. 66-68. Bultmann has replied to Percy's
criticisms with equal vigor in Orient. Lit.-zeit., 1940, cols. 150-75. The writer's reaction may be briefly stated as follows. Mandaeanism is definitely post-Gnostic,
reflecting an advanced form of dualism which is more Iranian than anything comparable in the Western forms of Gnosis. The Gospel of John reflects certain concepts which must have been current in proto-Gnosticism but, as Percy makes clear, without attaching to them dualistic connotations of Iranian character; i. e. light and darkness, truth and lie are contrasted ideas in John and these
ideas possess dualistic potentialities, but they are in no sense cosmological and
metaphysical entities as assumed by Bultmann. On the other hand, Bultmann is right in objecting to Percy's arbitrary exegesis of John and to his constant denial of soteriological implications to the Mandaean conceptions under discussion.
88 It must be emphasized that, though Mandaean is very closely related to Babylonian Aramaic, as was recognized by Noldeke in his epoch-making Mandaische Grammatik (1875), its orthography is considerably later in type and the laryngals are thrown together. Even in the oldest amulets the confusion of laryngals is already evident, though the system of vowel-letters is still com
paratively undeveloped. Now the orthography of Babylonian Aramaic was presumably fixed during the Amoraic period of the Talmud, i. e., between 300 and 500 A, D. It follows that the oldest Mandaean inscriptions can hardly antedate the sixth century. Lidzbarski's dating of a lead amulet about 400 A. D. was thus highly improbable (contrast J. Thomas, op. tit., p. 214, n. 3) and a date a century or more later is probable.
88 For references to Lidzbarski and H. Bauer and for additions to their material see the writer, Am. Jour. Sem. Lang., LIII (1936), pp. 11 f. For Babylonian survivals cf. (in addition to the material collected previously by Anz
and Zimmern) the writer's suggestions and observations, Am. Jour. Sem. Lang.,
XXXVI (1920), pp. 265 f., 291 fF., now in part superseded. At an early opportunity the writer hopes to describe a number of unrecognized Babylonian elements in Mandaeanism, some of them very striking (the figure of Miryai, the Virgin Mary, has, for example, been assimilated to the Babylonian Sabitu
Sambethe). None of these pagan elements proves that the Mandaean system is particularly ancient: they only show that it has inherited much pagan material from earlier syncretistic sects.

cbristliche jiidische Gnosticismus, Gottingen, 1898, and subsequently) carried his conclusions so far that a reaction set in and respectable scholars stopped mentioning its possible existence (cf. Moore's Judaism, 1927, and BoussetGressmann, Die Religion des Judentums, 1926). The soundest treatment of the subject by a friendly Jewish scholar up to recently was L. Blau's article,
" Gnosticism," in the Jewish Encyclopedia. (V, 1903, pp. 681-6). In recent years the situation has changed, owing to new materials and methods being employed
by competent scholars. H. Odeberg's publication of "Third Enoch " (The Hebrew Book of Enoch, Cambridge, 1928; cf. Lagrange's review, Rev. Bib., 1930, pp. 452-5) has brought to light a Hebrew work with definitely Gnostic tendencies, dating from the second or third century A.D. This confirms the views of G. Scholem, the foremost living authority on the Qabbala, who has maintained a much higher antiquity for the principal ideas of the Zohar than hitherto supposed by critical students; cf. especially his article "Kabbala" in
Encyclopaedia Judaica, IX (1932), pp. 630-732, and Die Geheimnisse der Schopjung, Berlin, 1935. In this connection it may be mentioned that Scholem
has pointed out probable dependence of the palmistry of the Qabbala on lost cuneiform prototypes, in which the lines of the hand were compared to cunei
form characters. The earliest Jewish scholar with Gnostic tendencies who is mentioned in the Talmud is Johanan ben Zakkai, a contemporary of St. Paul
and the first " Christian " Gnostic, Simon Magus.
48 See Chap. Ill, n. 64.
"See also the important study of V. Hamp, Der Begriff "Wort" in den aramaischen Bibelubersetzungen, Munich, 1938). Hamp comes to the same conclusion as Moore after an exhaustive analysis of the relevant targumic mate
rial ; he also goes a shade too far in treating memra as exclusively a " translation phenomenon"; cf. P. Benoit, "Rev. Bib,, 1939, pp. 617 ff.
50 Cf. Am. Jour. Sem. Lang., XLI (1925), pp. 92-98, 284; XLIII, 233 ff. The
usual view is that these figures are polytheistic borrowings from Aramaean paganism; see for elaborate discussion and full bibliographic references A.

62 In addition to the material collected by Vincent see J. P. Hyatt, Jour. Bib. Lit., 1937, pp. 387 ff. 68 For the latest discussion of the subject, with fairly adequate bibliography, see W. O. E. Oesterley, The Labyrinth (London, 1935), pp. 115-158.
64 On the relative antiquity of Mesopotamian proto-Baptist ideas and practices
see the writer, Am. Jour. Sem. Lang., XXXVI (1920), p. 293 (cf. J. Thomas, op. cit.} pp. 307 f.). "See the writer's discussion, Han. Theol Rev., XVII (1924), pp. 190 ff. Contrast Torrey's interpretation, slightly modified by de Zwaan, four. Bib. Lit., LVII, pp. 165 f. Even if they are correct in principle, the Greek of John reflects
a very early exegetic interpretation for which there is no Hebrew scriptural warrant. 56 See Schaeder, Gnomon, 5 (1929), pp. 353-370; J. Thomas, op. tit., passim (especially pp. 415 ff.). "Zeits. Neutest. Wiss., XXVIII (1929), pp. 312-20.
68 On the ultimate origin of the idea see G. A. Barton, Jour. Am. Or. Soc., 56 (1936), pp. 155-65. Barton's treatment is rather superficial and unnecessarily sensational in its statement, but may be partially correct; cf. the writer's observa
tions, Jour. Am. Or. Soc., 39 (1919), pp. 70 ff.; Am. Jour. Sem. Lang., XXXV (1919), pp. 161-195; and especially ibid., XXXVI, pp. 292 f.

69 A good illustration of the situation is provided by the " Usziah "
inscription, discovered and published by E. L. Sukenik; cf. the writer's observations, Bull. Am. Scb. Or. Res., No. 44 (1931), pp. 8 ff. When the inscription was first examined, there were two words in it which defied Jewish scholars: the second, which is found in Biblical Aramaic but not in Jewish Aramaic; the third, which

is not known from any Jewish Aramaic dialect but appears in Samaritan. Two
such words out of eight is a rather high proportion!

78 Cf. above, n. 65.
78 Zeits. Neutest. Wiss., XXX (1931), pp. 124-144. In this connection attention may be called to the admirable brief statement of the question and equally sympathetic resolution of it by J. A. Montgomery, The Origin of the Gospel according to St. John, Philadelphia, 1923. "Cf. the writer, Harv. Theol. Rev., XVII (1924), pp. 193 ff.; M. J. Lagrange, Rev. Bib., 1937, pp. 321-41; and contrast C. C. McCown, four. Bib.
Lit., LIX (1940), p. 120, n. 10.
76 It is often assumed or deduced that Paul had not been trained in Jewish
law " at the feet of Gamaliel," or at least not for long (cf., e. g., A. D. Nock,
St. Paul, 1938, pp. 27-33). On the other hand, J. Klausner, From Jesus to Paul
(Hebrew, Tel-Aviv, 1939-40), II, 9-12 and passim, protests vigorously against
the views of Gratz and other Jewish and Christian scholars who insist that Paul
was only an " 'am ha'ares," a man ignorant of Jewish law. On the resemblance between Pauline and rabbinic methods of exegesis see P. Bonsirven, Exegese
rabbinique et ex&gese paulinienne (Paris, 1939), who devotes more than 400 pages to a careful analysis of the question (cf. the review by P. Benoit, Rev. Bib., 1940, pp. 288 fT.).
78 To this extent the writer agrees with the interesting remarks of J. Klausner at the end of Vol. II of the work cited above.
77 S. H. Langdon, Babylonian Wisdom (London, 1923), p. 90, line 6.
78 Cf. H. Preisker, Arch. Rel.f XXXV (1938), pp. 93-114. The Pharisees had, however, begun the movement toward Hellenistic universalism which reached its
culmination with Jesus and Paul; cf. above, n. 24. On the relation between Jesus and the Pharisees see also S. Zeitlin, Essays and Studies in Memory of Linda R. Miller (New York, 1938), pp. 235-86.
70 See A. D. Nock, Conversion, Oxford, 1933.
80 For the most exhaustive and also the most extreme statement of the theory of Pauline dependence on Hellenistic mystery-cults see R. Reitzenstein, Die hellenistischen Mysterienreligionen, ihre Grundgedanken und Wirkungen, third ed., Leipzig, 1927. For a much more sober verdict by a first-class scholar see
A. D. Nock, St. Paul, London, 1938 (it is characteristic that the word " mystery "
does not appear in his index), especially pp. 77 ff.
81 The most thorough and critical treatment of these matters remains that of C. Clemen, Religionsgeschicbtliche Erklarung des Neuen Testaments, Giessen, 1934, pp. 62 ff., 192 ff. There is, of course, a vast literature on the subject including, on the liberal side, the works of A. Loisy (e.g., Histoire et mythe a propos de Jesus-Christ, Paris, 1938) and, on the conservative side, the voluminous
writings of M. J. Lagrange. New material from the ancient Near East continues
to make its appearance. On the "virginity" of the Canaanite deities Anath
and Astarte see especially the writer, Jour. Pal. Or. Soc., XII (1932), p. 193; on the probable
"
virginity
" of the mother of Tammuz, Zertur-Siduri, see Am. Jour. Sem. Lang., XXXVI, p. 262. For the three days spent by a god of fertility
in the underworld see Jour. Am. Or. Soc., 39, pp. 89 f., where the lunar and agricultural basis of the number is shown, S. Kramer has just discovered and
23



342 FROM THE STONE AGE TO CHRISTIANITY
translated a new fragment of the Sumerian original of the Descent of Ishtar in which the goddess Innini is explicitly said to remain three days and three nights in the underworld (Bull. Am. Sck. Or. Res., No. 79, Oct., 1940). It must be remembered that the three days spent by Christ in Hades is a tkeologumenon from the Old Testament and does not correspond to the chronology of the Gospels, where a day and two nights seem to elapse between the crucifixion and the Resurrection. 83 For detailed exposition of Breasted's humanistic philosophy of religious
evolution see The Dawn of Conscience (New York, 1933), especially pp. 411-20. Cf. also Time, XVIII: 24, pp. 23 f. (Dec. 14, 1931) ; the writer, The American Scholar, 1936, pp. 295 ff. For a discussion of the historical significance of Judaeo-Christianity from a theistic point of view, paralleling and supplementing
the treatment here, see the writer's paper " Archaeology and Religion," presented
at the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in New York City, September, 1940 (to appear in the publications of the Conference). It may be observed in this connection that it is singularly one-sided to recognize that man's physical constitution is an elaborately designed structure which will at best require a vast amount of research to understand, but at the same time to insist that the emotional, aesthetic, and religious ideas and aspirations of man are idle vestiges of a savage past or are mere puerile superstitions. It is far more
" reasonable " to recognize that, just as man is a being evolved by the eternal spirit of the Universe, so his religious life is the result of stimuli coming from the same source and progressing toward a definite goal. In other words, the evolution of man's religious life is guided by divine revelation. Since, moreover, the affective religious life of man has a much more complex and elusive structure,
composed of psychological and historical elements, than the body of man, how much more research will at best be required to comprehend it! Yet the positivistic rationalist and the religious humanist claim in their bybris to understand enough of it to be able to direct man's ethical and social aspirations, often
in serene disregard of our religious heritage.
