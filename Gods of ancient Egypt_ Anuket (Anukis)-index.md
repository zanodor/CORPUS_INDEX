Gods of ancient Egypt: Anuket (Anukis)
Anuket
The ancient Egyptian Goddess Anuket (also known as Anket, Anqet,
Anjet or Anukis) was a personification of the Nile as "Nourisher of the
Fields". She was also a goddess of the hunt and was worshipped as a
protective deity during childbirth.
She was associated with the lower
cataracts (near Aswan) and probably
originated in Nubia or Sudan.
Specifically, she was associated with
Setet Island (Sehel island) and Abu
(Elephantine) 1st nome of Upper Egypt,
and was goddess of everything south
of the Egyptian border. She was widely
worshipped in Nubia, and given the title "Mistress of Nubia". In
southern Nubia, Khnum merged with the ram-headed Amun, so
Anuket and Satet (Satis) in some places also appear as wives of
Amun.
She was originally the daughter of Ra, but seems to have been
associated with Satet since ancient times. In fact both these
goddesses were called the "Eye of Ra" (along with Sekhmet , Bast
and Hathor, amongst others). Similarly, both Anuket and Satet were
linked to the Ureas (the royal cobra on the god's crown). During the
New Kingdom she was placed in the Abu triad with Khnum and



Satet. These three water deities protected the Nile cataracts and the
area the Egyptians believed to be the source of the Nile. In later
times she was identified with Nephthys at the temple "Per-Mer" due
to Satet's links with the goddess Isis and Khnum's link with Osiris.
However both Satet and Anuket are closely linked to Isis, who took
on the attributes of the fertile waters of the Nile as well as being a
form of the star Sirius.
Anuket was generally depicted as a
woman wearing a tall headdress made
either of reeds or of ostrich feathers,
often holding a sceptre and the ankh
symbol, but was occasionally shown in
the form of a gazelle.
Her name means "embrace" and may
have originally referred the embrace of
the waters of the inundation. She was
also depicted suckling the pharaoh
during the New Kingdom, and became a goddess of lust during later
periods. In this form, she gained association with cowrie shells,
which resemble the vagina. The Festival of Anuket was held when
the innundation began. People threw coins, gold, jewelry, and
precious gifts into the Nile to please the goddess.
