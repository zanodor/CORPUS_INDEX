Tithi in Jyotiṣa, Hindu astronomy; Itihāsa Mahābhārata
War occurred in 3067 BCE
--the unusual occurrence of eclipses on 13th tithi reported in , Mahābhāratam (3031 and 3067 BCE)
This is an addendum to; nābhijānāmi amāvāsyāṁ trayodaśīm candrasūryāv ubhau grastāv '13th

"...a tithi is a [duration of two faces of moon that is observed from earth], or the time it takes for the longitudinal angle between the Moon and the Sun to increase by 12°. In other words, a tithi is a time-duration between the consecutive epochs that correspond to when the longitudinal-angle between sun and moon is an integer multiple of 12°. Tithis begin at varying times of day and vary in duration from approximately 19 to approximately 26 hours." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithi

For example, on Sept. 21, 2021, moonrise occurs at 6:20 PM and Purnima tithi is reckoned upto 5:24 AM. Thanks to MM Pandit for this lucid summary.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN_HGYd18j0 (9:56) This is a link to a Youtube video which explains tithi as a lunar day in Hindu calendar.
"Understanding the hindu calendar helps to understand the traditions practiced by hindus for millennia. This video clearly walks you through the calculations of a lunar day and the names of the Tithis andPakshas . Astronomy was a well developed science in ancient India and understanding these systems, brings a new perspective to our understanding of the science of Jyotisha.

This is a knowledge which was available and known to everyone a few generations back, and lost now due to modern schooling. Knowing these basics will help you to figure out the Panchangam or the Hindu Calendar and bring it into everyday use. "
Why did the Moon rush to dwell with the sun within 13 tithi-s, sometime in 3067 BCE?
Using Lodestar software, Balakrishna notes:
3129 BCE Solar Aug 11 13d20h20m (End/Start date)
3129 BCE Lunar Aug 25
According to Balakrishna, August 3129 BCE skymaps provides a pair of solar-lunar eclipses occurring within 13 days, 20 hours, 20 minutes duration separating them.
(Dating Mahabharata- Two Eclipses in Thirteen Days by Dr. S. Balakrishna
Abstract Mahabharata war is considered by many to be a historical event. The epic states that a singularly ominous pair of eclipses occurred in - Thirteen days - some time before the war. Using modern astronomical software, our article shows that a number of Thirteen day eclipse pairs were visible in Kurukshethra. Article suggests some candidate dates for Mahabharata war.)

In this table presented by Balakrishna, the tithi duration in years 1397, 1708, 1853, 2056, 2529, 3129 BCE, ranged between 13d20h8m to 13d21h30m.
The variations in tithi duration caused by moon's celestial rotation is the key issue to be analysed to explain
the eclipse on 13th tithi reported in , Mahābhāratam. Did such an eclipse occur in
3067 BCE?
Narahari Achar explains as follows:
[quote]Search for a lunar eclipse in Kartika Only two dates: 3067 BCE and 2183 BCE In both of these years, there is also a solar eclipse at Jyeshtha
Saturn at Rohini, Oct 21, 2183 BCE; Solar eclipse at Antares 2183 BC...Two important events:
Amavasya at Jyeshtha Bhishma’s expiry on Rohini, Magha shukla ashthami War takes place
between these two nakshtras. Two events one at Jyeshtha and another at Rohini. Interval : 13 days. 40 days =(13+27) 67 days =(13+27+27) 94 days= (13+27+27+27) First two ruled out 67

days corresponds to 2183 BCE 94 days corresponds to 3067 BCE For 2183 BCE, war should begin on an amavasya For 3067 BCE war ends on an amavasya. War could not have taken place much before 3000 BCE War could not have taken place much later than 2000 BCE. [unquote]

" The date of 3067 BCE is proposed on the basis that the equinox occurred near Jyeshtha; and there occurred a solar eclipse at Jyeshtha in the middle of an eclipse season, the solar eclipse being bordered by two lunar eclipses. The earlier lunar eclipse occurred on krtika full moon. The second lunar eclipse followed the solar eclipse in less than fourteen days. It is demonstrated that the simulations of the events described in the epic satisfy the stringent astronomical conditions surprisingly well. The simulations persuasively point to a date ~3000 BCE for the events and hence for the Mahbhrata war. The accuracy and the limitations of the simulations are also discussed."
"The problem of eclipse pairs occurring within an interval of thirteendays is addressed next. It is shown that one must really consider an eclipse season with three eclipses, with two lunar eclipses bordering a solar eclipse. The fact that there was an equinox at Jyeshtha renders the conditions to be very stringent and leads to the proposed date of the event. This also turns out tobe identical to the date, which had been proposed by Raghavan. The simulations show that the astronomical events must have occurred around 3000BCE, thus establishing the date of the war also as ~3000 BCE. Preliminary reports of this study have been presented14 at the International Conference on Mahābhārata in Montreal, and at the WAVES conference in Dartmouth."

Thus, 13-tithi eclipses have, in fact, been recorded on skymaps, an event which is viewed with
awe by Veda Vyāsa who says:
caturdaśīṁ pañcadaśīṁ bhūtapūrvāṁ ca ṣoḍaśīm
imāṁ tu nābhijānāmi amāvāsyāṁ trayodaśīm

An eclipse season similar to the one in 3067 BCE occurs 36 years later in 3031 BCE. such occurrences of eclipses are called 'Aparvani' eclipse sequences occurring in less than 15 tithi-s. All such aparvani eclipses relate to the moon and the sun coming together in less than 15 tithi-s. The variations in the duration of a tithi caused by the oscillating movements of the moon are the clear reason for the aparvani eclipses recorded in historical time sequences narrated in the Epic,

aparvaṇi grahāv etau prajāḥ saṁkṣapayiṣyataḥ
(Mahabharata 6.3.28, 29)
"A lunar fortnight had hitherto consisted of fourteen days, or fifteen days (as usual), or sixteen days. This, however, I never knew that the day of new-moon would be on the thirteenth day from the first lunation, or the day of full-moon on the thirteenth day from the same. And yet in course of the same month both the Moon and the Sun have undergone eclipses on the thirteenth days from the day of the first lunation. 3 The Sun and the Moon therefore, by undergoing eclipses on unusual days, 4 will cause a great slaughter of the creatures of the earth. (Translator, Kisari Mohan Ganguly’s Footnote: This sloka is omitted in many editions, though it is certainly genuine. I have rendered it very freely, as otherwise it would be unintelligible. The fact is, three lunations twice meeting together in course of the same lunar fortnight is very rare. The lunarfortnight (Paksha) being then reduced by two days, the day of full-moon or that of new moon, instead of being (as usual) the fifteenth day from the first lunation becomes the thirteenth day. Lunar-eclipses always occur on days of the full-moon, while solar-eclipses on those of the new moon. Such eclipses, therefore, occurring on days removed from the days of the first lunation by thirteen instead of (as usual) fifteen days, are very extraordinary occurrences.)

The text is unambiguous. It refers to an unsual amāvāsyāṁ trayodaśīm and also to two consecutive eclipses related to this unusual event of thirteenth-tithi amāvāsyā. (A lunar day is a tithi)..."There are approximately 29.5 lunar days in a lunar month. The first fifteen days begin with the first phase of the waxing moon (pratipat) and end with the full moon (pūrṇimā). [...] In accordance with the lunar day, one would utter, [for example, amāvasyā-tithau]."(Arcanadipika cited at https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/amavasya)
"Amāvasyā ( ) refers to the “new moon”. Āpastamba-yajña-paribhāṣā-sūtras.—“let a man sacrifice with the Amāvāsyā sacrifice at the time of the Amāvāsyā, new moon. And let a man sacrifice with the Paurṇamāsyā sacrifice at the time of the Paurṇamāsī, full moon, thus it is
said. [...] Let a man observe that new-moon day (amāvāsyā) as a day of abstinence, on which the
moon is not seen”.Amāvāsyā is the dwelling together, i.e. the conjunction, of sun and moon...That which falls on the fourteenth day is called Pūrvā-amāvāsyā, or Sinīvālī, the ἕνη καὶ νέα; that which falls on the pratipad, the first day of the new phase, is called Kuhū, Uttarāamāvāsyā. Śvoyuktā. See also Ait.-Brāhm. II, 4; Nir. XI, 31-32...Amāvāsyā ( ) refers to “new-moon” day. The next day marks the start of the counting of tithis (lunar day), which at

fifteen days reaches purṇimā (full-moon), after which the counting of tithis starts again for
another fifteen days where it ends with amāvāsya again. The term is used throughout Jyotiṣa literature. Amāvāsyā(literally the “dwelling together” of the Sun and Moon) is the period of newmoon, or that point of time when the longitudes of the Sun and Moon are equal...Amāvāsyā ( ).—The time when Pitṛs worship moon and when the sun, moon and constellations meet together in the same maṇḍala; Pitṛs drink the nectar of the moon (1/15) part of it remaining;
there is no moon, middle sun—half night half day.1 yajñas with 21 saṃjñas.2 Only when two of its kalas remain, the moon enters the orbit of the sun and stays in the ray called amā and hence the period is amāvāsyā,3 fit for śrāddha.4"

The dates arrived at by Prof. Achar and Srinivasa Raghavan close to this date --and consistent with the skymap observations of the war events recorded by Veda Vyāsa are: Sept. 29, Oct. 14 and Oct. 28, 3067 BCE.

I hope astronomers will explore the tithi durations on the three dates: Sept. 29, Oct. 14 and Oct. 28, 3067 BCE.
