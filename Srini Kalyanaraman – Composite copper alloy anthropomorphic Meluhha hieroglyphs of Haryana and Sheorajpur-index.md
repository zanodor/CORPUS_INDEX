Composite copper alloy anthropomorphic Meluhha hieroglyphs of Haryana and Sheorajpur: fish, markhor, crocodile, one-horned young bull
Oxford English Dictionary defines anthropomorphic: "a. treating the deity as anthropomorphous, or as having a human form and character; b. attributing a human personality to anything impersonal or irrational."
The copper anthropomorph of Haryana is comparable to and an elaboration of a copper anthropomorph of Sheorajpur, Uttar Pradesh. Both deploy Meluhha hieroglyphs using rebusmetonymy layered cipher of Indus writing.
The hieroglyhs of the anthropomorphs are a remarkable archaeological evidence attesting to the evidence of an ancient Samskritam text, Baudhāyana śrautasūtra.
Baudhāyana śrautasūtra 18.44 which documents migrations of Āyu and Amavasu from a central region:
pran Ayuh pravavraja. tasyaite Kuru-Pancalah Kasi-Videha ity. etad Ayavam pravrajam. pratyan amavasus. tasyaite Gandharvarayas Parsavo ‘ratta ity. etad Amavasavam
Trans. Ayu went east, his is the Yamuna-Ganga region (Kuru-Pancala, Kasi-Videha). Amavasu went west, his is Gandhara, Parsu and Araṭṭa.
Ayu went east from Kurukshetra to Kuru-Pancala, Kasi-Videha. The migratory path of Meluhha artisand in the lineage of Ayu of the Rigvedic tradition, to Kasi-Videha certainly included the very ancient temple town of Sheorajpur of Dist. Etawah (Kanpur), Uttar Pradesh.
Haryana anthropormorph (in the Kurukshetra region on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati) deploys hieroglyphs of markhor (horns), crocodile and one-horned young bull together with an inscription text using Indus Script hieroglyphs. The Sheorajpur anthropomorph deploys hieroglyphs of markhor (horns) and fish. The astonishing continuity of archaeo-metallurgical tradition of Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization is evident from a temple in Sheorajpur on the banks of Sacred River Ganga. This temple dedicated to Siva has metalwork ceilings !!!
Both anthropomorph artefacts in copper alloy are metalwork catalogs of dhokara kamar 'cire perdue (lost-wax) metal casters'.
Hieroglyhph: eraka 'wing' Rebus: eraka, arka 'copper'.In 2003, Paul Yule wrote a remarkable article on metallic anthropomorphic figures derived from Magan/Makkan, i.e. from an Umm anNar period context in al-Aqir/Bahla' in the south-western piedmont of the western Hajjar chain. "These artefacts are compared with those from northern Indian in terms of their origin and/or dating. They are particularly interesting owing to a secure provenance in middle Oman...The anthropomorphic artefacts dealt with...are all the more interesting as documents of an evergrowing body of information on prehistoric international contact/influence bridging the void between south-eastern Arabia and South Asia...Gerd Weisgerber recounts that in winter of



2
1983/4...al-Aqir near Bahla' in the al-Zahirah Wilaya delivered prehistoric planoconvex 'bun' ingots and other metallic artefacts from the same find complex..."
In the following plate, Figs. 1 to 5 are anthropomorphs, with 'winged' attributes. The metal finds from the al-Aqir wall include ingots, figures, an axe blade, a hoe, and a cleaver (see fig. 1, 1-8), all in copper alloy.

Fig. 1: Prehistoric metallic artefacts from the Sultanate of Oman: 1-8 al-Aqir/Bahla'; 9 Ra's alJins 2, building vii, room 2, period 3 (DA 11961) "The cleaver no. 8 is unparalleled in the prehistory of the entire Near East. Its form resembles an iron coco-nut knife from a reportedly subrecent context in Gudevella (near Kharligarh, Dist. Balangir, Orissa) which the author examined some years ago in India...The dating of the figures, which command our immediate attention, depends on two strands of thought. First, the Umm an-Nar Period/Culture dating mentioned above, en-compasses a time-space from 2500 to 1800 BC. In any case, the presence of “bun“ ingots among the finds by nomeans contradicts a dating for the anthropomorphic figures toward the end of the second millennium BC. Since these are a product of a simple form of copper production, they existed with the beginning of smelting in Oman. The earliest dated examples predate this, i.e. the Umm an-NarPeriod. Thereafter, copper continues to be produced intothe medieval period. Anthropomorphic figures from the Ganges-Yamuna Doab which resemble significantly theal-Aqir artefacts (fig. 2,10-15) form a second line of evidence for the dating. To date, some 21 anthropomorphsfrom northern India have been published." (p. 539; cf. Yule, 1985, 128: Yule et al. 1989 (1992) 274: Yule et al 2002. More are known to exist, particularly from a large hoard deriving from Madarpur.)

The anthropomorph from Lothal/Gujarat (fig. 2,11), from a layer which its excavator dates to the 19 th century BCE. Lothal, phase 4 of period A, type 1. Some anthropomorphs were found stratified together with Ochre-Coloured Pottery, dated to ca. 2nd millennium BCE. Anthropomorph of Ra's al-Jins (Fig. 1,9) clearly reinforces the fact that South Asians travelled to and stayed at the site of Ra's al-Jins. "The excavators date the context from which the Ra’s al-Jins copper artefact derived to their period III, i.e. 2300-2200 BCE (Cleuziou & Tosi 1997, 57), which falls within thesame time as at least some of the copper ingots which are represented at al-Aqir, and for example also in contextfrom al-Maysar site M01...the FrancoItalian teamhas emphasized the presence of a settled Harappan-Peri-od population and lively trade with South Asia at Ra's al-Jins in coastal Arabia. (Cleuziou, S. & Tosi, M., 1997, Evidence for the use of aromatics in the early Bronze Age of Oman, in: A. Avanzini, ed., Profumi d'Arabia, Rome 57-81)."
"In the late third-early second millennium, given the presence of a textually documented 'Meluhha village' in Lagash (southern Mesopotamia), one cannot be too surprised that such colonies existed 'east of Eden' in south-eastern Arabia juxtaposed with South Asia. In any case, here we encounter yet again evidence for contact between the two regions -- a contact of greater intimacy and importance than for the other areas of the Gulf."(Paul Yule, 2003, Beyond the pale of near Eastern Archaeology: Anthropomorphic figures from al-Aqir near Bahla' In: Stöllner, T. (Hrsg.): Mensch und Bergbau Studies in Honour of Gerd Weisgerber on Occasion of his 65th Birthday. Bochum 2003, pp. 537-542).

With curved horns, the ’anthropomorph’ is a ligature of a mountain goat or markhor (makara) and a fish incised between the horns. Typical find of Gangetic Copper Hoards. At Sheorajpur, three anthropomorphs in metal were found. (Sheorajpur, Dt. Kanpur. Three anthropomorphic figures of copper. AI, 7, 1951, pp. 20, 29).
One anthropomorph had fish hieroglyph incised on the chest of the copper object, Sheorajpur, upper Ganges valley, ca. 2nd millennium BCE, 4 kg; 47.7 X 39 X 2.1 cm.

Thus, together read rebus: ayo meḍh ‘iron stone ore, metal merchant.’

A remarkable legacy of the civilization occurs in the use of ‘fish‘ sign on a
copper anthropomorph found in a copper hoard. This is an apparent link of the ‘fish’ broadly
with the profession of ‘metal-work’. The ‘fish’ sign is apparently related to the copper object
which seems to depict a ‘fighting ram’ symbolized by its in-curving horns. The ‘fish’ sign may
relate to a copper furnace. The underlying imagery defined by the style of the copper casting is
the pair of curving horns of a fighting ram ligatured into the outspread legs (of a warrior).



7
The center-piece of the makara symbolism is that it is a big jhasa, big fish, but with ligatured
components (alligator snout, elephant trunk, elephant legs and antelope face). Each of these
components can be explained (alligator: manger; elephant trunk: sunda; elephant: ibha; antelope:
ranku; rebus: mangar ‘smith’; sunda ‘furnace’; ib ‘iron’; ranku ‘tin’); thus the makara jhasa or
the big composite fish is a complex of metallurgical repertoire.)
One nidhi was makara (syn. Kohl, antimony); the second was makara (or, jhasa, fish) [bed.a
hako (ayo)(syn. bhed.a ‘furnace’; med. ‘iron’; ayas ‘metal’)]; the third was kharva (syn. karba,
iron).

The extraordinary presence of a Lothal anthropomorph of the type found on the banks of River Ganga in Sheorajpur (Uttar Pradesh) makes it apposite to discuss the anthropomorph as a Meluhha hieroglyph, since Lothal is reportedly a mature site of the civilization which has

produced nearly 7000 inscriptions (what may be called Meluhha epigraphs, almost all of which are relatable to the bronze age metalwork of India).

"Anthropomorphs occur in a variety of shapes and sizes (Plate A). The two basic types dominate, as defined by the proportions in combination with certain morphological features. All show processes suggestive of a human head, arms and legs. With one exception (no. 539) all are highly geometricising and flat. Fashioned from thick metal sheeting, these artifacts have stocky proportions and are patterned on both sides with elongated gouches or dents which usually are lengthwise oriented. Sometimes, however, the patterning is chevroned or cross-hatched. Significantly, the upper edge of the 'head' shows no thickening, as is the case of type H anthropomorphs. Examples have come to light at mid doab and a broken anthropomorph from distant Lothal as well. The only stratified example derives from Lothal, level IV. height range. 23.2-24.1cm; L/W: 0.65 - 0.88: 1; weight mean: 1260 gm." (Yule, Paul, pp.51-52).
"Conclusions..."To the west at Harappa Lothal in Gujarat the presence of a fragmentary import type I anthropomorph suggests contact with the doab." "(p.92)

A clipped enlargement of the 'inscription' from the photograph of composite anthropomorph
It appears that the inscription is composed of Indus Script hieroglyphs and no Brahmi letters can be discerned. Hopefully, Prof. Naman Ahuja's response to my request will provide for a transcript with sharper visibility.
According to the curaorf, Naman Ahuja, the inscription in Brahmi reads “King/Ki Ma Jhi [name of king]/ Sha Da Ya [form of god]” and according to the curator, “looks unmistakably like the Hindu god Varaha”. The Uttar Pradesh archaeological department has accepted this as an antique piece and dates it to the second to the first millennium BCE.

The hieroglyphs of the inscription include the following, possible metalwork catalog:
Hieroglyph: baraḍo = spine; backbone (Tulu) Rebus: baran, bharat ‘mixed alloys’ (5 copper, 4 zinc and 1 tin) (Punjabi)
.

Image from from The Art Newspaper
The remarkable artifact 30 cm tall, 2 kg., is said to have been found under the foundation of a home in Haryana. It was in display in Brussels and later in Delhi in September 2014.
Description which appeared in The Art Newspaper reads: “The figure has a cast relief on its chest of a unicorn-like animal, similar to motifs found on seals of the Harappa culture, which thrived until around 1900 BCE.”
The inscription above this creature; according to the curator Naman Ahuja the inscription represents “a combination of Harappan signs and Brahmi letters.”
I have requested Prof. Naman Ahuja for a photograph with legible reading of the inscription. From the photographs which appeared in The Art Newspaper and Business Standard report, It appears to have some Indus Script hieroglyphs.

A remarkable combined (ligatured) hieroglyph is reported by N. Ganesan. (I have requested for
details of provenience). The hieroglyphs are: 1. crocodile; 2. one-horned young bull; 3.
anthropomorph (with ram's curved horns, body and legs resembling a person)
See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/01/crocodiles-help-scholar-link-indus.html
The rebus readings of the composite hieroglyph may be suggested:



16
1. khoṇḍ, kõda 'young bull-calf' Rebus: k dār ‘turner’. कोंद kōnda ‘engraver, lapidary setting or
infixing gems’ (Marathi)
2. kāru 'crocodile' (Telugu) Rebus: kāruvu 'artisan' (Telugu) khār 'blacksmith' (Kashmiri)
3. tagara 'ram' (Kannada) Rebus: damgar 'merchant' (Akkadian) tagara 'tin' (Kannada) The
anthropomorph 'ram' hieroglyph together with incised 'fish' hieroglyph reads: tagara ayo 'metal
alloy (with tin)'. This was the stock-in-trade of the artisan/merchant damgar.
These rebus readings may explain the deployment of 'crocodile' hieroglyph on the Dholavira
tablet:

A count of six locks of hair on the bearded person in the middle, flanked by – holding apart -
two one-horned young bulls. Personified as bull-man (bearded person ligatured to the back of a
bovine) battles with lions. (Mesopotamia. Cylinder seal)
Many examples of Meluhha hieroglyphs present a person ligatured to bovine features. The same
pattern is repeated in hundreds of Akkadian/Sumerian/Elam/Persian Gulf cylinder seals. These
are Meluhha hieroglyphs denoting rebus a smith. In the example of Pict-103 presented below, the
smith is a dhokra kamar, a smith engaged in lost-wax casting. The same hieroglyph as shown on
Pict-103 (Mohenjo-daro seal) is repeated on a Dholavira molded terracotta tablet.

About a temple in Sheorajpur with metal ceiling
Stunning metallic ceiling of Shivrajpur temple. Sheorajpur has yielded a bronze anthropomorph with 'fish' Meluhha hieroglyph Link: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/01/meluhha-hieroglyphs-snarling-iron-of.html
Could this be the work of dhokra kamar? this is an amazing structure by any standards as a ceiling of a S'iva temple called Kereshwar in Shivrajpur, a village on the banks of Ganga.

Many bronze artifacts are also venerated in the temple.
I hope some researcher will find out the sources for these bronze/brass marvels which echoe the anthropomorph of ancient India?
Sheorajpur anthropomorph with 'fish' hieroglyph and 'markhor' horns hieroglyph. ayo'fish' Rebus: ayo 'iron, metal' (Gujarati) miṇḍāl markhor (Tor.wali) meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: meḍ 'iron' (Ho.) Prima facie, it appears that these are products of dhokra kamar metalworkers NB: Some historical notes:
Pratihara emperor, Mihir Bhoja, has ruled in nearby Kanpur since nearby Kannuaj was the capital of Parihar. At Shivrajpur, 20 km from the Kanpur Central railway station, there is an ancient temple built by Chandel Raja Sati Prasad. The history of the temple and architecture needs further investigations and researches.
