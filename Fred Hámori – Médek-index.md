Introduction
Mesopotamia housed distinct local populations belonging to the linguistic
groups of Dravidian (agglutinative), Hurro-Urartian, (agglutinative),
Sumeria (agglutinative) and later Semitic (Babylonian, Assyrian,
Chaldean, flexive) languages. In the whirlwind of history, in the 5th mill.
BC Sumerians entered the stage, no later than the 3rd mill. BC the
Turkic tribes came to the fore, Indo-Aryan migrants started showing up
at about 1500 BC, between 1000 and 900 BC Medians moved in, with
their recurved bows attesting that they brought over the steppe nomadic
technology never mastered by the Indo-Aryan migrants.
Between 1000 and 500 BC major upheavals shook the area, with
Cimmerians and Scythians from the north assailing Assyrians,
Babylonians, Medes, and the Assyrian tributaries Chaldeans, Egyptians,
Lydians and Arameans. The scepter of local domination passed from
Babylonians to Assyrians to Guties to Assyrians to Medes, to Scythians,
back to Medes, back to the Iranian Achaemenid Empire, to Macedonian
Greeks, Parthians, and finally to the Iranian Sassanid Empire. That clear
and unambiguous sequence of events was successfully mangled by the
European kulturträgers of the 19th c. that injected Iranian myths into
the falsified Iranian prehistory, replacing real players with effigies of the
pseudo-Iranian heroes. At every turn of the history, scientific research
debunked falsification, but the unfading legends invented in the Sassanid
time continue to serve nationalistic purposes of the politicians.
Terminology:



Iran - A name of a country from 1934, after the Turkic officer Reza
Khan, title-name Reza Khan Mirpanj ( رضا خان میرپنج ), a commander of
the Cossack Cavalry Brigade, staged a coup against the Qajar dynasty,
and took a title-name Reza Khan Sardar Sepah ( رضا خان سردار سپه ).
Upon being proclaimed a Shah, Reza Khan took a throne name Reza
Shah Pahlavi ( ( )رضا پهلوی r. 1925 – 1941), and proclaimed his son
Mohammad Reza a Crown Prince of Persia. Americans know him as
their puppet the Shah of Iran. In 1935 the ancient official name of
Persia was changed to Iran. In shaping history, Reza Khan followed in
steps of the Achaemenid Cyrus II (Achaemenids, 550 – 330 BC),
Partho-Sassanian Ardashir I (Sassanids, 224–651 AD), and Saman
Khudat (Samanids, 819–999), who shamelessly exploited the local
Iranian patriotism for their ends.
Iranian - A western branch of Indo-Iranians, aka Indo-Aryans and
Aryans, a group of E. European tribes of the 3rd mill. BC who
migrated south-east to the Hindustan peninsula and Iranian plateau,
reaching them ca 2000 BC and 1500 BC respectively. The term is
collective supra-tribal and supra-political, its origin lays in the modern
linguistic taxonomy of the Iranian linguistic branch, a subfamily of the
Indo-European linguistic family. The genetic origin other than the
native components is still undecipherable. They only became
noticeable after 700 BC, so that the earlier dates are exaggerated
guesses.
Semitic - An eastern branch of Afro-Asiatic languages of the people
marked by predominant Y-DNA haplogroup J1c3 associated with
Middle Eastern origins that spread from southwest Asia to Africa in a
series of reciprocative movements
Dravidian - The exonym Dravidian refers to the native population of
the Iranian Plateau marked by predominant haplogroups L1 Y-DNA
and HV14 and U1a mtDNA. Nearly extinct in their native area,
Dravidians migrated to and flourished in the Hindustan peninsula.
Reportedly, Dravidians of the 5th mill. BC and later migrations



brought agriculture to India. Some experts claim that they were the
basis of the Mohenjo Daro and Harrapa civilization. On the Iranian
Plateau, Dravidian languages were largely supplanted by dominant
Persian languages by the 10th c. AD, while their culture and art
gained monikers of “Sassanid art”, “Persian art”, etc.
Persians - Confederation of 10 tribes after Indo-Aryan peasant
migrants reached Fars and coalesced in Fars ca 500BC. Fars is an
allophone of Pars and Parth, a branch of the nomadic Dahae
(Tokhars), that gave its name to the Persian coalition. Some of the
native tribes were the Elamites of Fars. The term Persian originated as
a toponym, it was a supra-ethnic term. The allied tribes encounter
literate population and enter historical period as:
– leading tribes Pasargadai - most noble and hence nomadic including
Achaimenidai clan, Maraphians, Maspians;
– peasant tribes Panthaliaians, Derusiaians, Germanians (Kerman,
Karmania, Καρμανία, Kermania, Germania, Carmonia, Žermanya,
Go'asheer, Bardesheer, translated as “bravery and combat”, i.e. Tr.
“fortress” is likened to Tr. er “fortress”. Geographers have recorded
Kerman's ancient name as "" (). );
– nomadic tribes Daoi, Mardians, Dropicans, Sagartians, Yautiyans,
Uxians.
Mede history is a link between the old Mesopotamians like the
Sumerians, Hurrians, Elamites and the later Semitic people from the
south, who were then followed by the ancestors of the Persians. This
is a critical attempt to find how this nation fits into the scheme of
Mesopotamian history before the Persians came to power. Media
originally was a northern Mesopotamian country located at first
between the Caspean Sea on the north and the great rivers of
Mesopotamia on the west. The area changed as a results of it's growth
in power to become the Mede Empire (728 to 550BC) and later it's
loss to the Persians. The people of course continued much longer in



the area. The province of Atropane was it's center. The ties between
the Medes and the Scythians are also very important as it caused the
exodus of various tribes to the north and east, perhaps to escape
Persian rule. I bring up various problems with the current
presumption that the Medes were closely related to Iranian and
therefore are considered to be IndoEuropeans. My goal is not to
substitute an alternate solution, but to show that no solution is truly
available due to lack of information about their language. Much of
what we know is inconclusive presumptions.
When we talk about ancient history, we are not talking about hard
and provable scientific facts, especially when discussing the events
that occurred in the ancient world. We base much of our assumptions
and modern interpretation of fragments, tainted by our current views
and what we think we know about the past. If we are wrong about
some things it can affect our judgment about many other of our
assumptions as well. True there are few records of certain events that
can be partially trusted, but even dates using various calendars are not
always reliable. Our current Christian calendar was only introduced
around 1000AD, long after the death of Christ. There were many
dating methods in the past and we can't be sure that their
relationships to one another is always correct. In the case of many
languages of the area of Iran and Azerbaijan, such as the language of
the Medes, not a single contemporary document nor a single
monument remains from Media itself. Based on such a vacuum of
data, the Medes were claimed to be IndoEuropeans. Hopefully this
will explain why I have some reservations about the commonly
propagated and "accepted" history and language of the Medes. To me
the modern version of Mede history is more of a myth than facts. This
also occurred with the earlier Mittani, who probably gave the name of
the territory which later changed to Media.



The term Mede appears to be a geographical designation originally,
rather than an ethnic one. It is rarely mentioned, but there was an
earlier Mittani Empire (1500 to 1300BC) in roughly the same area as
Media. These names are obviously very
similar and perhaps they were
related. The Mittani were
aboriginal Hurrian -Subarian in
language and in their time, there
started a slow infiltration of
IndoEuropean type speakers into
the region. The predecessors of
the later Persians were a multi
lingual coalition formed after 1000BC, and only became significant
after 700BC. The Persian language could only have developed around
this time frame into a unique language.
Old legends from Mesopotamia about the Mittani claim that their 40
clans came from the south, to escape growing Semitic tyranny at
home. The same happened with some of the Sumerians who had to
leave their homelands. The Babilonian Berossus, who translated the
history of Mesopotamia into Greek, for Alexander the Great,
apparently also equated the Mittani and Medes for some reason, in his



timeline of history. It was Strabo in the 1st century AD that mentioned
the similarity of Mede and Persian, long after the independence of
Media was lost. As subjects of Persia they naturally would have
learned the language of their rulers, even if they didn't abandon their
own. Speaking multiple languages was the rule not the exception in
the past. Even George Syncellos (?-810AD), who lived many years in
Palestine and later moved to Byzanteum , in his great work
Chronologia, wrote that there were two Mede empires one before the
Assyrians and one after.
The Mittani
The belief that the Mittani were IndoEuropean is based upon a few
Hindu deities mentioned in a Hittite document from the Mittani area,
by a charriot horse trainer Kikkuli around 1400 BC, deities such as
Mithra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatya,[1] along with many other local gods
that were not IndoEuropean. These Hindu gods are not known in
Europe so that they cannot be IndoEuropean, but only Iranic at best
which has been blown totally out of proportion. IndoEuropean is a
purely linguistic category, and since the language of the Mittani was
Hurrian, according to even the Hittites, they cannot possibly be called
IndoEuropean just because the Hittite author was stationed in Mittani
territory. It's a repeat of the old story of the tail waging the dog. That
their treaties included gods of the their various ethnic communities is
not unusual. This strangely lead to the conclusion that the Mittani
rulers were also IndoEuropeans rather than Hurrian, even though
their language and their documents were not in IndoEuropean nor
Semitic language but in Hurrian. Most reference to the Mittani claim
them to be IndoEuropean, even though at best this element was
insignificant. The Mittani Empire did not last until the beginning of
the Mede empire, because of their conquest and subjugation by the
Hittites and Assyrians, however there is no reason to think that the
people of the region could not have survived, even if there were other



ethnic elements in Media. There is good reason to presume that the
infiltration of Iranic and Hittite elements did over time affect their
ethnic makeup, even though its not certain at all that it replaced their
culture and language. Subjugation is paying tribute and some political
control and not a demographic change. From the following
information we can not prove that some amount of change did not
happen, but we can show that since the names of Mittani rulers did
not have Indo European names, a complete language replacement
could not and did not happen. But that's just my politically incorrect
opinion, it takes very little to convince our IndoEuropanists friends of
the opposite, regardless of their lack of tangible evidence. They have
done this with a host of other historic people in ancient history, so
they can be made to appear to rule everywhere.The I.E. categorization
of the Medes follows a similar method as was the case with the
Mittani and is just as unjustifiable.
AN OUTLINE OF MEDIAN HISTORY
In their early history the Medes lived under various chiefs rather than
a single king, just like their neighbors the Urartuans or even the
Sumerians who had city states like the Greeks.
880 BC Arbaces destroyed the Assyrian capital Niniveh. /Diod. ii. 32
sqq
836 BC Assyrian conqueror Shalmaneser II, receives tribute from the
Amadai during the wars against the tribes of the Zagros Mtns.
829 BC Urartu Hurrians win control of Mannai and Mada from Shasi
Adad V.
812-782 BC Adad-nirari III claims subjection of Madai and Parsua.
800 BC Hadad-nirary defeated Kana-ziruka, the ruler of the Matiene
region Medes
730 BC The Assyrian Tiglathpileser III encounters Parsua (Persian)



folk in central Zagros mountains.
719 Sargon II establishes central Parsuash (Kirmansah) as an Assyrian
province.
715. Diaukku (Herodotus' Deioces), a Mannaean or Median chieftain,
joins Urartu in an anti Assyrian alliance. He is later captured by
Sargon and exiled.
The Greek Herodotus also writes of Deioc(es), 728BC-675BC
[Daiukku in Assyrian cuneiform documents] as the founder of the
Mede royal house. His name Dayuku is Subartuan in origin according
to König. The Subar, Supri were the natives of northern Mesopotamia,
who probably preceded the Sumerian settlement in the south, from
northern Mesopotamia. The Subarian name later was applied to the
Sumerians through a *b>m sound shift by their neighbors, even
though the Sumerians never called themselves, their land or their
language by anything like that. The implication is that they were
viewed somehow to be related or similar to Subarians. Later the
Subarians remained in northern Mesopotamia in the land of Subartu,
where they eventually allied with the western Huns, mentioned in the
Avesta and became known as Sabirs, then becoming the basis of the
Bulgars and Magyars as reported by the Byzanteen Emperor,
Porpurogenitos concerning the Magyars . The source of the emperors
statements derived from a visiting Magyar prince visiting his court.
712 Ukshatar (Cyaxares I), a rebellious chieftain of north Zagros, pays
tribute to the Akkadian Sargon.
710 onwards Medes form extensive kingdom in north Iran.
The founder of the Mede state was a man called Arphaxad who was
called Arbaces by the Greeks. In 708BC the Medes gained
independence from Assyria, under the leadership of Arpha-xad. This



name is much like the Scythian legend's Arpaxa(is), mentioned by
Herodotus, and the Hurrian city-state of Arpad. In an article about
Scythian vocabulary list, I wrote that Arpad means leader of
men/army. Arpaxad was known as a dispenser of justice, who
attracted people toward him as a leader of his people. A variant of the
name Arbat or Árpád is commonly used in Turkic and Hungarian.
700-650 Pursua (Persian) folk move south into Parsumash (Bakhtiari
hills):
In 692, Sennacherib lists Anshan and Parsu-mash amongst his foes.
700-668 Cimmerian invasion of the Near East from Eastern Europe.
They are also considered to be IndoEuropean for no known reason.
Mannai revolt joined by Ishpakaia, a Scythian (or Cimmerian)
678 BC Teushpa, a Cimmerian leader, breaks Assyrian hold on
Kurdistan.
675?BC Teispes (Chishpish), son of Hakamanish of Parsumash, takes
the land of Anshan.
674 BC Kashtaritu/Khshathrita (Pharaortes son of Deioces?) leads a
coalition of Medes, Mannai and Cimmerians against Esarhaddon, the
Assyrian ruler.
The next ruler who followed Arphaxad was Phraort(es) 675BC
653BC, who was also called Katrites. He extended his rule over the
Iranian plateau as far as the Hindu Kush. He ruled for 22 years, and
died in an unsuccessful war against the neighboring Assyrians.
670 BC Khshatrhrita takes the land of Parsumash and reduces Teispes
to vassalage.



660 BC The Assyrian king Assurbanipal regains Mannaean territory.
653?BC Khshathrita dies, eventually succeeded by his son Khuvakh
shatra (Cyaxares II)
653-625 BC Scythian domination of western Iran and actually much
of the Near East.
The Scythians from the north seized power for 28years. However at
the end of this time their leaders were invited to a great banquet by
the Medes and massacred. During the Scythian occupation the Medes
reorganized their armies into independent units of horsemen, archers
and infantry. Cyaxares added the Urartuan (Hurrian speaking) lands
around lake Urmia and strengthened his power. Later they won a
decisive victory over the Scyhians.
639 BC Cyrus I succeeds Teispes in Parsumash/Anshan; Ariaramnes
succeeds Teispes, and becomes king of Parsa.
Cyaxar(es) was the next Mede ruler (625BC to 653BC) who organized
an alliance against the Assyrians with the aid of the Chaldean
Nebopalesar. Their attack on Assyria was unsuccessful partly because
the Scythians under the leadership of Madyas sided with the
Assyrians. The Scythians were very well paid off for their timely help.
Madyas was given an Assyrian royal bride and the usual lands and
wealth to go with it.
625-585 BC Cyaxares II (Khuvakhshatra) rules Media and with the
help of the Chaldean Nabopolassar, the Chaldean defeats Assyria and
Urartu in 612 BC. The Medes then spread their control over northern
Mesopotamia, Armenia and Cappadocia. When Cyaxares attacked
Lydia, the kings of Cilicia and Babylon intervened and negotiated a
peace in 585 BC, whereby the Halys river was established as the
Mede's frontier with Lydia in 585BC.



584-550 BC Astyages suceeds Cyaxares in Media.
Astyag(es) [Istuvgu in cuneiform texts] (585BC-550BC) was the last
Mede ruler, that was deposed by a palace coup in 593BC when the
Persians took over as rulers. There were several Mede attempts after
this, to regain independence from the Persians, but none succeeded.
553-550 BC The Persian king Cyrus rebelled against the Mede king
Astyages, son of Cyaxares and won a decisive victory in 550BC. He
captured the Median capital city of Ekbatana (modern Hamadan). The
Mede king was the grandfather of the wife of Cyrus. The Persian king
Cyrus II (Kurus) was mentioned in Nabonidus' chronicle as King of
Anshan. Cyrus then made peace with the Medians and consolidated a
Persian - Median Empire by utilizing Median and Persian
administrators known as "satraps".
Start of Achaemenid Persian Empire, 559BC - 530BC
549 BC Cyrus II subjugates his cousin Arsames and thereafter is
mentioned by Nabonidus as king of Anshan and Parsu.
547 BC onwards Cyrus conquers Lydia and establishes Achaemenid
Persian Empire.
409 BC A rebellion against Persian rule of Darius II.
The non Persian tribes of the north, especially the Cadusii were always
troublesome and many expeditions of later Persian kings are recorded.
(Kad=tribe, Usi or Uzi are Turkic tribal names.)
330 BC Alexander the Great occupied Media.
In 328 Alexander appointed as satrap of Media a former general of
Darius called Atropates (Atrupat), whose daughter was married to
Perdiccas in 324, according to Arian.



Persian kings
Achaemenes Teispes
The "Teis-pes" name is Hurrian in origin, from their deity Teshub.
Tuspa is a Urartuan-Hurrian name.
Cyrus I (Kurush) a name similar to an Assyrian title for governor. The
kur, chur title was also a tribal ruler of the Huns and was also found in
Türkic KÜR to mean courageous and fearless. Whether there was any
link between the later and the Kurush name is unknown, but is not
impossible since the Huns were in the vicinity of Iran according to the
Avesta (ca 1000BC) , long before the documented appearance of the
Huns next to China around 300BC.
Cambys(es) I (Kambiz)



Cyrus the Great, (Kyros)
THE MEDE LANGUAGE REMAINS
Richard Fry, the expert of Persian history summarized the situation as
follows: "The Medes themselves were a mixture of indigenous and
Iranian peoples... for their tribal names are also a mixture of
Iranian(?) and non-Iranian names, in spite of all the attempts to
explain them all from Iranian." To me all of the tribal names can be
explained without the use of Persian although since we cannot know
what the names signified, even this is nothing more than an educated
guess just as the Iranic explanation.



Richard Fry further writes: "In Azerbaidzan (N.E. Iran) and Western
Iran, the Iranian newcomers came in contact with a larger settled
inhabitants, who were not Indo-Europeans and these were the
Urartuans, Manai, Hurrians. ... These were related to the "paleo
Caucasian" languages, which are sometimes called Japhetic languages.
[2] South of them lived the Elamites and further east of them the
Dravidian people of Makran, Seistan (aka Scythians) next to Sind
(India)." None of these were Indo-European and yet Japhetic is being
appropriated to mean IE, erasing with this euphemism the oldest Near
Eastern languages. The Sumerians, Urartuans, Hurrians, Manai,
Dravidians fell out of the Biblical story of the sons of Noah, even
though they created the first great civilizations. According to Richard
Fry the founders of the Achamenian dynasty of Persia were very likely
Elamites. The Elamite language which was also the language of the
written records in Persia was also not Semitic nor IndoEuropean, even
though for some unknown reason the Bible links the Elamites to the
sons of Shem, perhaps due to a later subjugation or political union.
The researcher of the ancient world, John Baldwin (1929-2015),
stated the problem as follows: "The so called old Iranian documents
were forced into being represented as Iranian history, which is illogical
and created so much confusion, that it is hard to understand how it
could have happened. Those who see nothing else except Persians in
the prehistory of Iran and coolly reject dynasties before Gilshah as
mere fairy tales, do nothing or worse than nothing with the
Pesdadians and then commence the histories with the Kaiani dynasty,
and then add to them the most famous of the Pesdadian kings. They
contrive this to begin only in 600 BC. With such methods all of this
becomes Iranian history and Zoroaster is to be from the age of Darius
Hystaspes." Since the pre-Sasanian history of the Avesta didn't exist
except as oral tradition, and was written down in the 9th through the
11th century in the so called Pahlavi books, it was written in the



language of the latest times. Its original could have been anything
else.
Persian experts like Richard Fry claim that at best some of the Mede
ethnic elements were Iranians, but many were not. In the beginning,
none of the Mede ethnic elements were Iranians, but eventually at the
end of the Achaemenid period they would have been diluted by Iranic
immigrants. The Greek historian Herodotus also separates the Persians
as "artai" and the Medes as "aryan". This term "aryan" has nothing to
do with a race or even a language group, and has been hijacked by the
Europeans, especially the Germans, to give the word an unintended
new meaning. The literature of the time of these nations used the
term independent of the language type! It just refers to the ruling
elite, of any type of ethnic group or language.
The Uralic, Altaic, Sumerian, Dravidian term URU for blood, town
(clan residence), clan relations, power and strength etc are linked to
the term ary/er/erim for clan chief so that the term "aryan" is nothing
more than a variation of this term for blood lines, clans/family and
their strongman, ruler. Slaves of course did not have clan affiliations
or a chief.
The Persians took over the Mede Empire by means of a palace coup
over their Mede rulers, however even the so called first Persian royal
house "achamenian" were partly of Mede descent, with Hurrian-Mede
names.
THE SIX MEDIAN TRIBES MENTIONED BY HERODOTUS
Herodotus mentioned the 6 Mede ethnic "tribes", some of which are
similar to the Scythian tribal names. For this reason the two groups
are often associated to each other. Scythians with origins from the
area of Media included the famous Amazons, Sarmatians, Paralati.
They too have been hijacked by the Europeans to be singularly Indo



European on equally unproven grounds. The following explanations of
the tribal names are by no means conclusive and simply illustrate how
guessing based on linguistics can produce a great variety of results,
without any of it being certain.
1. The "Busae" group supposed to derive from the Persian term "buza"
which means the aboriginals < not Iranians>. We know that the
aboriginals couldn't have called themselves by such meaningless name
and that the aboriginals of Iran were not Indo-Europeans. It may very
well be their name which was later used to refer to them as natives.
However in that case it had a different meaning to the natives
themselves. Was this really based on an originally Iranian term or
their own designation is not known for certain. I believe that there
may be a relation to the Scythian "pasi-ani" which in Turkic became
"petchegen ", which in Hungarian is Besenyö. This tribe was often
allied with the Parthians. The Turkic "Petchegen" from Bečenek meant
"inlaws" and was the marital partner tribe of the Kangars in the area
bordering the Aral Sea.
2. The second group is called " Parae-tak-(eni)" in Persian and it
supposedly came to mean nomads. This name is much like the
Scythian "Para-la-ti", one of the royal tribes ruled by the Scythian
Kolaxis[3], but its doubtful that it meant simply nomads. Similarly in
Sumerian the term bar=rib, boundary, wastelands. It was in such
lands that were useless for cultivation that the "nomads" and
shepherds worked their flocks. (Hungarian "par-lag", Sumerian "par
im", Scythian "para-la-ti" perhaps are linked). Generally the nobility
did not have anything to do with farmers and lived a semi nomadic
life, which offered a lot more leisure and freedoms from repetitive
chores. By no means was this "nomadic" culture" a lower culture than
those of the simple settled farmers as European scholars of the past
have claimed. Perhaps there is also a link to Turkic paraltto shine,
make shining (rendered in English “Sublime”); because of their



homophony. The Etruscans also originated, before their move into
Europe, from North Western Anatolia, and in their language their
ruler or commander was called a "parnix" which reminds me of
Hungarian "parancs" that means a command, in other words a
commander. Could the prince of Troy, called Paris, be related to this?
All of these are nothing but guesses and have little historic substance,
without local validation, since words can be twisted and turned to fit
many situations.
3.The third group is called "Stru-khat". Here the term "Chat, Khat,
Had, Geta" can mean clan or clan territory as in Scythian "xoda",
Uralic "xonta", Turkic "guz", Hungarian "had" and Dravidian languages
or "KAATI" which means the royal house of the Hatti. The term STRU
in Mesopotamia meant to cover, while Turkish "chatir" and Hungarian
"shátor" or Sumerian "sudug" means a simple tent or a temporary
cover or shelter. If this is relevant then these people also lived in a
portable shelters in a nomadic way. We can't be certain however that
the interpretation is valid, since we don't know anything about
Median vocabulary, let alone grammar.
4. The fourth tribe was the "Ari-zan-ti" Note that the "-ti" suffix is the
plural suffix in proto Uralic and proto Turkic languages. The " hari, ari,
khari" name may derive from the name of the highlands and
mountains of northern Mesopotamia and was also the ethnic name of
the Hurrians. A similar name in Hurrian is "iuri" that meant lord. This
word is usually latched onto by I.E. scholars as "aryan", which they
misinterpret to be unique to Iranic and IndoEuropean. Yet Herodotus
does not even call the Persians "aryan", but the Medes! The term is
found all over the Near East to mean the same thing strength, power,
dominance, rule in non IE languages.
Sumerian ur "sir,lord, title of kings and gods", uru "strong, mighty"
Hungarian ur "sir, lord, master", erö=strength, erös "strong"



Hurrian iuri "lord, king"
FinnoUgrian *uras "strong dominant male"
Turkic erik "strong male", iri "big, mighty"
Dravidic ur-am "force, bravery"
The term "zanti" however could refer to a tribal name and if we take
into consideration the centum/kentum dialectal variation then Zanti
can be Khanti or Hanti or Hun, which is also a tribal designation that
doesn't refer to any specific tribal group. There were Khanti in Ugrian
and there were Xiung Nu near China and there are Kion Huns
mentioned in the Avesta and Hunas written on the walls of Persepolis,
the old capital of Persia. These need not be identical related people,
but they are likely to be the predecessors or even close relations of the
later Turko-Hun people. That of course is also speculative, but less
ridiculous than the unexplained reason for calling Medes Iranians
ethnically. Iran should be used as a geographical term, which is still
inhabited by a large number of diverse ethnic elements with their own
languages. This was even more like that in the distant past, before the
infiltration from the north of the ancestors of the Persians who were
probably greatly diluted by the locals. We know that even the oldest
native peoples living there were not related to the old Persians
linguistically. Yet they were Iranians in the sense that their homeland
was Iran.
5. The fifth group was the "Budii". A similar name was mentioned by
the Greek historian Herodotus living amongst the Scythians north of
the Black Sea by the name "Budi-ni" as well as the eastern Saka. The
ni ending is another type of plural suffix. Budha was of the tribe
"Budha"., which was Scythian "sakiya" in Sanskrit documents. The
name could also be related to BUDIN the non noble masses in Turkic
languages. They were serfs and workmen, rather than nobles and
warriors. We can't be sure that the name did not go through some
distortions causing us to misinterpret it based on our currently



inadequate knowledge of history, nor can we be sure that the proper
language we use to interpret is valid. Ancient history after all is 90%
biased guesses and a sprinkling of reliable evidence. A name taken out
of context can be interpreted in many ways.
6.The sixth tribe, which is also stated by many experts to be non
Iranian, is the Magi. They were a priestly class, who were the carriers
of not Iranian religion but ancient Mesopotamian religion deriving
possibly from the Sumerians, Babylonians and Hurrians. This religion
was later reformed by Zoroaster, who some have claimed to be of
Median origin [4], who introduced his reforms in Iran, before there
was a Persia. Zoroaster's date of birth is not known but is estimated by
Avesta experts to be in the range of 1000BC to 800BC. The Magi
name implies also a link with the language of the Sumerians, who
called their language "Emegir", which is usually translated from the
Sumerian language to mean the "princely or noble tongue".
Simplified, over time to Magi. The old religion of the Sumerians was
adopted all over Mesopotamia and its priestly tongue remained
emegir or emegi, or Magi. The Magian religion had spread into
Central Asia probably as early as the time of Sumerian rule. The later
schism between Zoroastreanism, which was adopted by the Persians
and the old Magian religion was one of the main reasons for the long
standing feud between Iran and Turan, which is described in their
religious books known as the Avesta. This change eventually resulted
in changing the local Magian religious language to an early form of
Persian when it was finally written down in the 9th century AD.
Generally the eastern areas of Iran and beyond as well as some of the
Medes clung to the older form of the Magian faith. Although many of
the Medes eventually became Zoroastreans as did many western Huns
living in Turan. Zoroaster may have originated in Media, although
apparently his countrymen rejected his new religion at first, which
attempted to eliminate certain "negative" features of their ancient



faith, much like Protestanism reformed the Catholic faith. That also
didn't go smoothly and caused Christian infighting.
MEDE PERSONAL NAMES
König writes that there are no Mede basic words that are known for
sure, only personal names or titles. However there are a handful
which are perhaps from Mede that were recorded by Herodotus (484
425BC). Words like "spaka" (k/s and p/b alteration Turkicköbäk) for
dog, "čithra" for divine glory, "zura" for evil (Turkic. šär for evil,
Hungarian szörnyü=horrible),while "zura-ka" for evil doer. (
Hungarian and Sumerian -ik, -og are verbative suffixes) Obviously
there must be more remaining words from Mede, although we have
no way of recognizing them. Early Mede names are known from two
Assyrian military reports. The first from 800BC that lists 28 names. Of
these 19 are certainly not Iranian and 4 are Chaldean-Urartuan
Hurrian, 4 are unknown, leaving one which "might be" Iranian. The
second report is from ca. 700 BC and lists 26 names. Of these 5 sound
"sort of" Iranian, the others are not. It would be interesting to know
what names they are referring to in many articles that claim that the
Mede rulers were mainly IndoEuropeans. The reason for this claim is
not explained in the articles I have seen. Even if true the few Persian
sounding names only proves the possibility of Persian allies. It's quite
obvious that there was a strong Mede influence on the Persians, so
that Mede personal names were also present in Persia, which replaced
the Median Empire. These could then become interpreted later to be
Persian. The question might be considered whether these words have
a meaningful Persian etymology? Here are examples of Mede names.
Gobrias was the governor of Kurdistan and a Mede.
Mazares and Harpagos were Medes who conquered Ionia for Cyrus.
It was the Assyrians who first recorded the name of the new Mede



nation as "Mata", which is based on an ancient Mesopotamian word
for a land area rather than any IndoEuropean or Iranian word. The
name Mada however is presumed to come from Indo-European for
"middle". The question is, middle of what? This label has little value in
defining a people and therefore it is unacceptable. I propose that it
may have represented the land, where the 6 tribal names coexisted.
The Mata word and its use is found in many old languages such as:
Ancient Anatolian ma =earth
Sumerian ma-ta, ma=land+ta=locative suffix,
Finnugor maGhe=land, (Finn,Estonian,Chuvash,Zurjen,Vogul etc
ma=land)
Parthian megala=province,
Old Hungarian magha =land and megye=province. gy is similar to dj.
Old Egyptian mat =land.
Old Japanese ma =country, land
Maidu Indian(of California) ma=place, land of
Maya Indian (of Mexico) ma =land
Obviously we are dealing with a very ancient word because it is so
widely spread. To my expected critics of including American Indian
languages to this comparison, let me reassure them that these
similarities are not singular coincidences, but have a broader
vocabulary base in the Americas than they could imagine.[5]
A legend remains about a dream of the Mede king Astyages, before
the rule of the Persian Cyrus. In a dream Astyages dreamed that from
the womb of his daughter Mandane a river flows and grows into a
mighty sea, which overwhelms Asia. Later in another dream he
dreams that from the womb of his daughter a grape vine grows, which
grows into a great giant tree that covers Asia. This dream foretold of a
new empire, which would topple his own but would be an offshoot of



it.
A similar dream is told over 1,000 years later about the Árpád dynasty
kings of Hungary. Where in a dream Emese, the mother of the royal
clan dreams that a sacred Turul eagle descended upon her (the holy
spirit) to impregnate her and from her womb a river flowed, which
grew in strength and flowed westwards. Overflowing the mountains
and then from it a great golden (royal) tree grew in the west. This
prophesized the rule of the Arpad house kings in Central Europe, but
also having bloodlines in France, Spain, England, Germany, Poland,
Greece, often as local saints.
There seems to me a marked similarity in the two legends, one
foretelling the end of the Mede (Mada) Empire and the beginning of
the
Persian one and the other foretelling the
beginning of a new central European
Magyar kingdom. Considering that both
nations were founded by an
"Arpad/Arpoxad" and both share a similar
name Mada/Madja~ Magya seems even
more curious, but certainly not conclusive.
There is however plenty of proof that
Magyars also lived in this area long ago
found in later Armenian and Papal records
as well as the presence of many military
and administrative titles that have Assyrian
origin. These titles were used by the
Magyars during their occupation of Hungary in the 10th century.
Horka (Harku a minor king), Tarján &Turkic Tarkhan? (Tartan the
engineering corps of the army), Kündü (Kundu is the link or emmisary
to god), Kádár (Kudur to do with law and judgement ), Solt & Zsolt
(Salat noble from kings family), Kusan (Khasánu vice king), Vezér



(Vizir =military commander), zakan a title of Arpád (Zakhanu a form
of magistracy, governing) possibly linked to khagan. All of these had
similar meaning./6 A province of the Magyars was known as Lebedi,
which the Greeks mistook to originate from a Magyar prince named
Lebedi, although it originated in Mesopotamia where Labuttu means a
province in Assyrian. The presence of so many common terms with
similar meaning cannot be a coincidence. Some of this is explained as
Turkic borrowings but here we have something quite early and in the
vicinity of Subartu, which was claimed to be the homeland of the
Magyars in the 9th century. If you look at our maps you can see that
early forms of the name Turk is also to be found there. This is identical
to the claims of the origin of the Magyars by the Magyar prince
visiting Byzanteum.
The image from the old Persian capital, Persepolis showing a Mede
and a Persian. It is worth noting that the Mede is dressed as a
horseman with boots and riding pants, while the Persian and most
IndoEuropeans were dressed in flowing robes that were not
convenient for horse riding. The Mede also carries a Scythian style
bow & arrow case hanging from his belt. These trappings were
common among the Scythians, Huns, Turks and Hungarians. Early
Hungarian clothes culture has many ties to northern Iranian apparel
and many carry their old names as well.
If we gather together the names referred to as Median, we discover
that almost all are non-Iranian, and most are Urartuan, Hurrian or
Elamite in origin. When western historians claim that the Medes are
Persian type of Iranians and also that their language is unknown, they
make a mockery of science and base everything on 19th century racist
biases, without conclusive proofs. Since Europeans spend the most
money on historic research and most others very little, they have
rewritten much of the world's history to aggrandize themselves, with
little effective opposition.



Yet I cannot truly believe that the Mede (Mada) language is not
represented in the ancient records, since they were an important
element in the Persian Empire. Perhaps it is undetected, simply
because it does not agree with the presumptions of biased historians.
The trilingual inscriptions of Behistun dealing with the so called
"Scythian text", which is non Iranian and according to some is
distantly related to Ural-Altaic, is probably Mede, since it was a
prominent language in the Persian Empire! [7] This evaluation was
from before modern times, before the Scythians were recast into a
new Indo European image, by modern European historians, who
threw the older history books into the garbage and ignored even the
claims of their own early orientalists. I don't claim that these old
references were completely reliable, but then nothing is.
At the same time, while this group is claimed also to be "Scythic" it is
not identical to the "Scythians" of the Black Sea, since the Medes have
many ties to the Hurrians and Elamites and by Herodotus time were
overrun by Iranian immigrants.
Yet there were some groups amongst the Scythians of Eastern Europe
that were claimed to originate from Media, with the same names as
the Mede tribes, showing a common Mesopotamian origin of both the
Scythians and Medes. (Budi/Budini, Paraetakeni/Paralati, the
Amazons ) etc. Herodotus also mentioned the coming of the Scythians
into Eastern Europe from south of the Caucasus Mtn. Some of the
Magyars also moved to these same areas in Eastern Europe along with
them.
Another major evidence against the Iranian origin of the Medes is that
Berossus, the Babylonian priest, who wrote down the ancient history
of Mesopotamia for the benefit of Alexander the Great, claimed that
the Medes were ancient Mesopotamians in origin. Perhaps he was
referring to the Mittani in this case rather than the Medes. That is



possible. Indeed his timetables imply that they were much the same as
the Sumerians, some of whose remnants came north after the loss of
their homeland to the Semitic Akkadians. This could be interpreted as
associating the Magi tribe's origin to the rest of the Mede tribes.
CONCLUSION
One must always be careful in accepting broad sweeping
generalizations of identity when talking of events thousands of years
earlier. From the Mede ethnic names alone one can see that these six
Mede tribes are not the same nor Iranian, else they would share a
common name. The exception being that the names imply classes of a
common society.. which sometimes also have different origins. Yet
there is likely a seed of truth in the statements of Berossus even if his
lists seem to be so different from our current understanding of history.
The view of Berossus may be based on one of the six Mede groups,
who are the carriers of ancient traditions and language. It is generally
agreed that the Magi are the most likely carriers of a reformed form of
the early Sumerian religion, which remained almost unchanged in the
religious motifs of the Hurrians-Urartuans. However none of these
early groups needs to be prePersian or Iranian. Just like the Hittites
were not the same as the local native Hatti. Their name was simply
taken over by their new masters. Even the Hittite language was less
than 20% indo European. Even this percentage can be an
exaggeration, since terms that are more than just IE cannot be claimed
to be IE in origin as is generally done.
The evidence indicates that a portion of the ancient Sumerians also
came from the north originally, from the direction of the Caucasus
Mtns. Their close relations to the northern Mesopotamian city of Arata
near Urartu implies this. Their traditions of the longest and shortest
day, also indicates their northern origins. Their building mountain like
temples to simulate their sacred mountains in their ancient northern



homelands, in the Caucasus could be seen as a possibility. The
presence of the so called Caucasus type racial element amongst them,
now known as "Armenoid" as well as so called "Asianic" types set them
apart from the curly haired and hairy Semites and Persians.
Unfortunately we cannot definitively place the Medes to belong to a
single linguistic group with trustworthy facts to support it and must
admit that they were perhaps a mixture or simply of an unknown
types of natives. Often it is much better to say that we don't know
something than to invent something, which then becomes a dogma.
1 ) Mithra is the god of justice, judgement, true speech, light and the
sun. Varuna (ur/ár-nagy) is the god of the celestial sea and water, and
law. Indra (on-dörg) is the god of rain, thunderstorms, the head of the
Devas, Nasatya (néz) is purushic ether, light of the senses of
knowledge and action.
2 )I cannot help but comment on the fact that today the native
cultures that existed for thousands of years have been removed from
some of the historic maps . This is shown on the designations of a map
I saw called "The world as known by the Hebrews". Today Japhetic has
become IndoEuropean, and that is just wrong. By changing Cymerian ,
Scythians, Magog, Mada to IE.
