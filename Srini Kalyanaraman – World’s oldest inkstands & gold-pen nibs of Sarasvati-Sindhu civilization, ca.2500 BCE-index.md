Gold pens like styluses with nibs
The pendants were perhaps worn with a thread of fibre passing through the eye of the needle-like ending of the pendants. Why needle-like endings? Maybe, the pendants were used as 'writing' devices, styluses 1) either to engrave hieroglyphs into objects; 2) or to use the needle-ending like a metal nib to dip into a colored ink or liquid or iron or zincoxide paste or cinnabar-paste. The writing on one pendant is in free-hand Indus Script inscription.

"The (pomegranate-shaped) vase content was sampled twice and analysed in the Labs of Sapienza University. Data collected suggest that inside the vase there was an organic fluid, leaving traces of iron oxide.“ (Lorenzo Nigro, 2018, Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) from Motya and its deepest oriental roots in: Vicino Oriente XXII (2018), pp. 63-64).

https://oi.uchicago.edu/collections/highlights/highlights-collectionpottery The kernos ring -- apart from use as an ink-stand with iron oxide pigment liquid to write on metal -- is a metalwork catalogue, shows two quails. vartaka 'quail' rebus: vartaka 'merchant' rebus: vartaka 'bell-metal' dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' Thus, cast bellmetal merchant. Antelope: ranku 'antelope' rebus ranku 'tin' ḍ̠āṛhū̃ 'pomegranate' rebus ḍhālako 'a large metal ingot'
I suggest that the kernos ring of vessels is like an ink-pot containing iron oxide liquid used as a writing ink, to write on metal objects, like copper tablets or gold pendants. The gold-pendants with sharp nibs might have been used as writing instruments.
