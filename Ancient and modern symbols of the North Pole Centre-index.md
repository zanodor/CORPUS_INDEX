Ancient and modern symbols of the North Pole Centre
NORTH POLE CENTRE
Examples of Rock Art symbolizing the Celestial North Pole.
Of course our ancestors have noticed that the stars are revolving.
That is, except from the point in the heaven where no movement
seems to take place. The seemingly rotating figure on the
northern hemisphere symbolizes the Greatest male deity in the
Mythological Story from all over the World. This figure symbolizes
for instants Chronos, Zeus, Odin, Saturn (not the planet) and
several other names.
But the figure are also symbolized with several other
phenomenon's, of which the Heavenly Ship and a White Horse or
Bull are the most common.



Picture 1 with a 4 spoke wheel drawn on the spot for the celestial
north pole centre on the star map. Pictures 2, 3 and 4 above are
from Sweden and pictures below 5 and 6 from USA. Picture 7 are
a detail of a Danish ritual kettle found on the location Gundestrup,
Jutland. Picture 8 is from Sweden.



The common for detail for all these pictures is a male figure with a
centre point in form of a wheel, a circle or concentric rings.



Above 3 pictures of the centre point marked as wheels. The first
picture from Sweden, Bohuslen, locality Loevaasen, is showing
the Milky Way figure made with rows of Cup Marks on the rock.
The last picture from the island Bornholm, Denmark, Olsker,
locality Bloeholtshuse, is showing the shape of a so called ship.
Concerning the so called rock carvings and other art pictures
showing ships, the origin has come when the Milky Way contours
are being seen horizontal. In many cases both a man and a ship is
shown together as for instance on the Egypt picture in the middle



above with the 5 pointed star as the symbol for the circumpolar
centre.
The rock carving ships with a so called "sun wheel" or other circle
markings above the ship, is by intellectual scholars interpreted as
"a ship transporting the Sun over the day- or night Sky". But in
fact these kinds of carvings is showing the night contours of the
Milky Way with the celestial marking of a turning point, namely
the pole centre.
The Sumerian Milky Way god, Shamash, and the Wheel of the
Celestial Pole.



The Sumerian Shamash and Wheel "flying in the Sky"
THOR ́S HAMMER AND THE CELESTIAL NORTH POLE
Thors Hammer resembling the celestial pole axis and the Milky
Way contours as seen below.



ROCK CARVINGS OF THE CELESTIAL NORTH POLE
A sketched part of a Danish Rock Carving from Northern Jutland,
locality Udsholt. The dark round markings represent the Star
constellation of Ursa Minor or "the Little Dipper" with the pole star
placed in the centre of a 4 spoke wheel. Here the Wheel is
without any doubts NOT a so called "Sun Wheel", but a "Night
Wheel" symbolizing the North Pole centre on the night Sky.
MULTI COSMOLOGICAL MEANING STONE



The Rock Art Debel- Stone from Denmark inserted in a Star Atlas
picture. Arrow number 1 marks the Celestial North Pole. Arrow 2
marks the Circum Polar Centre. Arrow 3 marks the contours of
the Milky Way. Arrow 4 marks the constellation of Sagittarius and
arrow 5 points towards the Milky Way Centre.
VAULTING HUMAN FIGURES AND THE POLE CENTRE
If You observe the night sky with its stars, star constellations and
the white contours of the Milky Way, it all seems to vault over a
longer time period around the centre point, we call The North
Pole centre. The white contours of the Milky Way is often
described mythological as "a white God" as seen above in the
Star Atlas picture to the right. Beside a Swedish rock carving
shows human like figures revolving around a centre point, carved
as a wheel, often called a "Sun-Wheel" which in this case
apparently is a wrong description.
The very same meaning and symbolic shows these 2 Rock



Carvings from Norway and Sweden.
