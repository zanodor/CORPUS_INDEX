MILKY WAY RIVER MYTHS
One sees what one have learned to see - and one judges everything on what one haven't learned to see!
This goes very much for the interpretations of the global Flood Myths that some scholars are taken very literary even for some mythologists that even can't connect what they read to what the Myth really says because they la cosmological knowledge that is incorporated in the Myths.
In the Wikipedia text below, all kind of mythological misunderstandings are taking place. Just have in mind every River is mentioned in myths, it most certainly tells of the Milky Way River - and of Milky Way Ships sailing around Heavenly Oceans.

The Milky Way Oceanus
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus
n classical antiquity, Oceanus (from Greek: Ὠκεανός, lit. "ocean"[1]) was believed to be the world-ocean, which the Romans and Greeks considered to be an enormous river encircling the world. (Namely the Milky Way Contour
Strictly speaking, Oceanus was (Of course NOT! Ivar) the ocean-stream at the Equator in which floated the hemisphere (oikoumene οἰκουμένη).[2] In Greek mythology, this world-ocean was personified as a Titan, a son of Gaia.
In Hellenistic and Roman mosaics, this Titan was often depicted as having the upper body of a muscular man with a lo and horns (often represented as the claws of a crab), and the lower torso of a serpent (cf. Typhon).
On a fragmentary archaic vessel (British Museum 1971.11-1.1) of ca 580 BC, among the gods arriving at the wedding and the sea-nymph Thetis, is a fish-tailed Oceanus, with a fish in one hand and a serpent in the other, gifts of bounty prophecy. In Roman mosaics, such as that from Bardo (illustration, left) he might carry a steering-oar and cradle a sh
Roman mosaic from Bardo, 2nd century CE
Some scholars believe that Oceanus originally represented all bodies of salt water, including the Mediterranean Sea Atlantic Ocean, the two largest bodies known to the ancient Greeks. However, as geography became more accurate, to represent the stranger, more unknown waters of the Atlantic Ocean (also called the "Ocean Sea"), while the newcom generation, Poseidon, ruled over the Mediterranean. (Rubbish)
Oceanus' consort is his sister Tethys, and from their union came the ocean nymphs, also known as the three-thousand and all the rivers of the world, fountains, and lakes.[3] From Cronus, of the race of Titans, the Olympian gods Hera mentions twice in Iliad book xiv her intended journey "to the ends of the generous earth on a visit to Oceanus, w gods have risen, and Tethys our mother who brought me up kindly in their own house."[4]

In most variations of the war between the Titans and the Olympians, or Titanomachy, Oceanus, along with Prometheu Themis, did not take the side of his fellow Titans against the Olympians, but instead withdrew from the conflict. In mo of this myth, Oceanus also refused to side with Cronus in the latter's revolt against their father, Uranus.

In the Iliad, the rich iconography of Achilles' shield, which was fashioned by Hephaestus, is enclosed, as the world itse believed to be, by Oceanus:
Then, running round the shield-rim, triple-ply, he pictured all the might of the Ocean stream.
When Odysseus and Nestor walk together along the shore of the sounding sea (Iliad ix.182) their prayers are great Sea-god who girdles the world." It is to Oceanus, not to Poseidon, that their thoughts are directed.
Invoked in passing by poets and figured as the father of rivers and streams, thus the progenitor of river gods only once in myth, as a representative of the archaic world that Heracles constantly threatened and bested.[5] loan from Helios of his golden bowl, in order to cross the wide expanse of the Ocean on his trip to the Hesperides tossed the bowl, Heracles threatened him and stilled his waves. The journey of Heracles in the sun-bowl upon Oceanu favored theme among painters of Attic pottery.

Mythology among cultures
Armenian
Ancient Armenian mythology called the Milky Way the "Straw Thief's Way". According to legend, the god Vahagn stole the Assyrian king Barsham and brought it to Armenia during a cold winter. When he fled across the heavens, he spille the straw along the way.[1]
Khoisan
The Khoisan people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky
Cherokee
A Cherokee folktale tells of a dog who stole some cornmeal and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling t along the way. The Milky Way is thus called Gili Ulisvsdanvyi "The Way the Dog Ran Away".[3]
Eastern Asia
Peoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the "Silvery River" of Heaven (Chinese: 柞မ Japanese: ginga). In one story, the stars Altair and Vega were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of magpies and crows formed a bridge over the galactic celebrated as Qi Xi, the Seventh Night (Chinese: Ӡॗ ; pinyin: qī xī, Korean: chilseok and Japanese: tanabata
Egyptian
In Egyptian mythology, the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. It was deified as a fertility cow-goddess by Bat (later on syncretized with the goddess Hathor).
Finno-Ugric



Among the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was called "The Pathway of the Birds" (Finnish Estonian: Linnutee). The Finns observed that the migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where believed Lintukoto (bird home) resided. In Estonian folklore it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with th maiden who chases birds of prey away.[4] Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory bird Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter.[citation needed] The name in the Indo-Europ languages has the same meaning (Lithuanian: Paukščių Takas, Latvian: Putnu Ceļš).
Jacopo Tintoretto's "The Origin of the Milky Way"
Greek and Roman
The Greek name for the Milky way (Γαλαξίας Galaxias) is derived from the word for milk (γάλα, gala). One legend exp Milky Way was created by Heracles when he was a baby.[2] His father, Zeus, was fond of his son, who was born of woman Alcmene. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife Hera's milk when she was asleep, an a would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke up and realized that she was breastfeeding an unknow pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way.
A story told by the Roman Hyginus in the Poeticon astronomicon (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk the goddess Ops (Greek Rhea), the wife of Saturn (Greek Cronus). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his positio the Pantheon and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son Jupiter (Greek Zeus): She wrapped infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed i milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way.[5]
Older Greek mythology associates the Milky Way with a herd of dairy cows/cattle, where each cow is a star and whose the blue glow.[citation needed] As such, it is intimately associated with legends concerning the constellation of Gemini is in contact. The constellation was named for the twins, Castor and Polydeuces, who sometimes raided cattle. In addi (in combination with Canis Major, Orion, Auriga, and the deserted area now called Camelopardalis) may form the orig myth of the Cattle of Geryon, one of The Twelve Labours of Heracles[citation needed].
Hindu
In the Hindu collection of stories called Bhagavata purana, all the visible stars and planets moving through space are l dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens is called śiśumãra cakra, the dolphin disc. The Milky Way form abdomen of the dolphin and is called Akasaganga which means "The Ganges River of the Sky".[6]
Hungarian
In Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians is supposed to ride Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Romania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called "The Warriors" Hungarian: Hadak Útja .[7]
Māori
To the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe as well as a reminder of how the stars were made.[8]
The slight bulge of the Milky Way around Scorpius is also sometimes pictured as a whale.

In addition, the dark patches are where a dangerous creature known as a yura lives; the Kaurna call these patches Yu which literally means "monster water."

Further south the band of stars that Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie.
In addition, the Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represe camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band repr mixture of both.

The Deluge myth = Flood Myths = Milky Way River Myths
"The Deluge", frontispiece to Gustave Doré's illustrated edition of the Bible. Based on the story of Noah's Ark, this shows humans and a tiger doomed by the flood futilely



attempting to save their children and cubs.
A deluge legend or flood legend is a legendary story of a great flood sent by a deity or deities to destroy (rubbish as an act of divine retribution (rubbish) . It is a widespread theme among many cultures, though it is perhaps best k modern times through the biblical account of Noah's Ark, the Hindu Puranic story of Manu, through Deucalion or Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

Flood legends in various cultures
Ancient Near East
Sumerian
Further information: Eridu Genesis
The earliest extant flood legend is contained in the fragmentary Sumerian Eridu Genesis, datable by its script to BCE.[1]
The story tells how the god Enki warns Ziusudra (meaning "he saw life," in reference to the gift of immortality given h



gods), of the gods' decision to destroy mankind in a flood—the passage describing why the gods have decided this is l instructs Ziusudra (also known as Atrahasis) to build a large boat—the text describing the instructions is also lost. Afte left to repopulate the earth, as in many other flood legends.
After a flood of seven days, Zi-ud-sura makes appropriate sacrifices and prostrations to An (sky-god) and Enlil and is given eternal life in Dilmun (the Sumerian Eden) by An and Enlil.
Babylonian (Epic of Gilgamesh)
Further information: Epic of Gilgamesh
The "Deluge tablet" (tablet 11) of the Epic of Gilgamesh in Akkadian.
In the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, toward the end of the He who saw the deep version by Sin-liqe-unninni to the great flood (tablet 11). This was a late addition to the Gilgamesh cycle, largely paraphrased or copied verbatim Epic of Atrahasis (see above).
The hero Gilgamesh, seeking immortality, searches out Utnapishtim in Dilmun, a kind of paradise on earth. Utnapishti Ea (equivalent of the Sumerian Enki) warned him of the gods' plan to destroy all life through a great flood and instruc build a vessel in which he could save his family, his friends, and his wealth and cattle. After the Deluge the gods repen action and made Utnapishtim immortal.
Jewish
Main article: Noah's Ark
The best-known version of the Jewish deluge legend is contained in the Book of Genesis (Genesis 6–9). Two non-cano the Enoch and Jubilees, both later than Genesis, contain elaborations on the Genesis story.
Genesis tells how "...the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the heart was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and was grieved in His he Lord said, 'I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things of the sky; for I am grieved that I have made them.'"[2]
God selects Noah, a man who "found favor in the eyes of the Lord"[3] and commands him to build an ark[4] to save No family, and the Earth's animals and birds. After Noah builds the ark, "all the fountains of the great deep burst open, floodgates of the sky were opened"[5]. Rain falls for 40 days, the water rises 150 days, and all the high mountains are The ark rests on the mountains, the water recedes for 150 days, until the waters are gone and Noah opens up the ark point Noah sends out a raven and then a dove to see if the flood waters have receded. Noah and the animals leave th offers a sacrifice to God, and God places a rainbow in the clouds as a sign that he will never again destroy the Earth b

Islamic
The Quran tells a similar story to the Judeo-Christian Genesis flood story, the major differences being only Noah and f from the laity enter the ark. Noah's son (one of four) and his wife refused to enter the ark thinking they will manage t himself. The Quranic ark comes to rest on Mount Judi, traditionally identified with a mountain near Mosul in modern name appears to derive from the local name of the Kurdish people, although this is not certain.
Asia-Pacific
China
There are many sources of flood legends in ancient Chinese literature. Some appear to refer to a worldwide deluge bu versions record only a regional flood:



Shujing, or "Book of History", probably written around 500 BCE or earlier, states in the opening chapters that Em facing the problem of flood waters that "reach to the Heavens". This is the backdrop for the intervention of the fa who succeeded in controlling the floods. He went on to found the first Chinese dynasty.[7] The translator of the 1 dated the Chinese deluge to 2348 BCE, calculating that this was the same year as the biblical flood[8]. In fact, th flood legend (including the biblical flood) was erroneously linked to a flood mentioned in the Sumerian king list actually dated to 2900 BCE.
Shanhaijing, "Classic of the Mountain & Seas", ends with the Chinese ruler Da Yu spending ten years to control a whose "floodwaters overflowed [to] heaven".[9]
Chuci, Liezi, Huainanzi, Shuowen Jiezi, Siku Quanshu, Songsi Dashu, and others, as well as many folk legends, a references to a woman named Nüwa. Nüwa repairs the broken heavens after a great flood or calamity, and world with people. There are many versions of this legend.[10]
The ancient Chinese civilization concentrated at the bank of Yellow River near present day Xian also believed that the flooding along the river bank was caused by dragons (representing gods) living in the river being angered by the mist people.
Lao (Indochina)
Legend of Khun Borom.
India
Incarnation of Vishnu as a Fish, from a devotional text.
Matsya (Fish in Sanskrit) was the first Avatara of Vishnu.
According to the Matsya Purana and Shatapatha Brahmana (I-8, 1-6), the mantri to the king of pre-ancient Dravida, who later becomes known as Manu was washing his hands in a river when a little fish swam into his hands and begged its life. He put it in a jar, which it soon outgrew; he successively moved it to a tank, a river and then the ocean. The fi warned him that a deluge would occur in a week that would destroy all life. Manu therefore built a boat which the fish mountaintop when the flood came, and thus he survived along with some "seeds of life" to re-establish life on earth. H religious tradition holds the Bhagavata Purana to be one of the works of Vyasa written at the beginning of Kali Yuga (a BCE) which pre-dates the Sumerian creation legend.
Andaman Islands
In legends of the aboriginal tribes inhabiting the Andaman Islands people became remiss of the commands given to th creation. Puluga, the god creator, ceased to visit them and then without further warning sent a devastating flood. Only survived this flood: two men, Loralola and Poilola, and two women, Kalola and Rimalola. When they landed they found lost their fire and all living things had perished. Puluga then recreated the animals and plants but does not seem to ha further instructions, nor did he return the fire to the survivors[11].
Indonesia
In Batak traditions, the earth rests on a giant snake, Naga-Padoha. One day, the snake tired of its burden and shook t into the sea. However, the God Batara-Guru saved his daughter by sending a mountain into the sea, and the descended from her. The Earth was later placed back onto the head of the snake.
Australia
According to the Australian aborigines, in the Dreamtime a huge frog drank all the water in the world and a drought sw the land. (Tidalik — this story originates from the Murray-Darling riverina of New South Wales and Victoria. The Murra



frequently experiences drought-flood cycles lasting up to years at a time, linked to El Niño/La Niña events in the Pacifi way to finish the drought was to make the frog laugh. Animals from all over Australia gathered together and one by o to make the frog laugh. When finally the eel succeeded, the frog opened his sleepy eyes, his big body quivered, his fa and, at last, he burst into a laugh that sounded like rolling thunder. The water poured from his mouth in a flood. It fille deepest rivers and covered the land. Only the highest mountain peaks were visible, like islands in the sea. Many men were drowned. The pelican who was blackfellow at that time painted himself with white clay and went from island to is great canoe, rescuing other blackfellows. Since that time pelicans have been black and white in remembrance of the G Flood[12].
New Zealand
In a tradition of the Ngati Porou, a Maori tribe of the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, Ruatapu became angry father Uenuku elevated his younger half-brother Kahutia-te-rangi ahead of him. Ruatapu lured Kahutia-te-rangi and a number of young men of high birth into his canoe, and took them out to sea where he drowned them. He called on th destroy his enemies and threatened to return as the great waves of early summer. As he struggled for his life, Kahutia recited an incantation invoking the southern humpback whales (paikea in Maori) to carry him ashore. Accordingly, he Paikea, and was the only survivor (Reedy 1997:83-85).
Some versions of the Maori story of Tawhaki contain episodes where the hero causes a flood to destroy the village of h jealous brothers-in-law. A comment in Grey's Polynesian Mythology may have given the Maori something they did not before — as A.W Reed put it, "In Polynesian Mythology Grey said that when Tawhaki's ancestors released the floods o earth was overwhelmed and all human beings perished — thus providing the Maori with his own version of the univers (Reed 1963:165, in a footnote). Christian influence has led to the appearance of genealogies where Tawhaki's grandfa reinterpreted as Shem, son of Noah of the biblical deluge.
Malaysia
According to the legend of the Temuan, one of the 18 indigenous tribes of peninsular Malaysia, the "celau" (storm of p is for the sin of the people who angered the gods and ancestors so much that a great flood was sent in punishment. O the Temuan tribes, Mamak and Inak Bungsuk, survived the flood by climbing the Eaglewood tree at "Gunung Raja" (R Mountain), which thereafter became the birth place and ancestral home of the Temuan tribe.
Europe
Greek
Greek mythology knows three floods. The flood of Ogyges, the flood of Deucalion and the flood of Dardanus, two of w two Ages of Man: the Ogygian Deluge ended the Silver Age, and the flood of Deucalion ended the First Bronze Age.
Ogyges
The Ogygian flood is so called because it occurred in the time of Ogyges,[13] a mythical king of Attica. Ogyges is some synonymous to "primeval", "primal", "earliest dawn". Others say he was founder and king of Thebes. In many traditio Ogygian flood is said to have covered the whole world and was so devastating that Attica remained without kings unti Cecrops.[14]
Plato in his Laws, Book III, estimates that this flood occurred 10,000 years before his time. Also in Timaeus (22) and (111-112) he describes the "great deluge of all" happening 9,000 years before the time of Solon, during the In addition, the texts report that "many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years" since Athens were preeminent.[15]
Map of eastern Mediterranean and Greece during 10,000 BCE.
The theory of the flood in the Aegean Basin, proposed that a great flood occurred at the end of the Late Pleistocene of the Holocene. The Holocene is a geological period that began approximately 11,550 calendar years BP (or about 96 continues to the present. This flood would coincide with the end of the last ice age, estimated approximately 10,000 when the sea level rose as much as 130 metres, particularly during Meltwater pulse 1A when sea level rose by some parts of the northern hemisphere over a period of less than 500 years.[16]
The map on the right shows how the region would look about 12,000 years ago, or 10,000 BCE, when the sea level



been 125 meters lower than today. The Peloponnese was connected to the mainland and the Corinthian Gulf was not f Islands around Attica, such as Aegina, Salamis and Euboea, were part of the mainland. The Cyclades formed a big isla Aegeis, while Bosporus and Hellespont was not formed yet.
These geological findings support the hypothesis that the Ogygian Deluge may well be based on a real event.
Deucalion
The Deucalion legend as told by Apollodorus in The Library has some similarity to Noah's Ark: Prometheus advised his Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few who escaped to high mountains. The mountains in were parted, and all the world beyond the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. Deucalion and his wife floating in the chest for nine days and nights, landed on Parnassus. An older version of the story told by Hellanicus ha "ark" landing on Mount Othrys in Thessaly. Another account has him landing on a peak, probably Phouka, in Nemea. When the rains ceased, he sacrificed to Zeus. Then, at the bidding of Zeus, he threw stones behind him, and men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women. Appollodorus gives this as an etymology for Greek derived from laas "stone". The Megarians told that Megarus, son of Zeus, escaped Deucalion's flood by swimming to th Mount Gerania, guided by the cries of cranes.
Dardanus
This one has the same basic story line. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Dardanus left Pheneus in Arcadia land in the North-East Aegean Sea. When the Dardanus' deluge occurred, the land was flooded and the mountain his family survived, formed the island of Samothrace. He left Samothrace on an inflated skin to the opposite shores of and settled at the foot of Mount Ida. Due to the fear of another flood they didn't build a city, but lived in the open for His grandson Tros eventually built a city, which was named Troy after him.
From The Theogony of Apollodorus
This one has the same basic story line as Deucalion. Prometheus moulded men out of water and earth and gave them which, unknown to Zeus, he had hidden in a stalk of fennel. But when Zeus learned of it, he ordered Hephaestus to na to Mount Caucasus, which is a Scythian mountain. On it Prometheus was nailed and kept bound for many years. Every eagle swooped on him and devoured the lobes of his liver, which grew by night. That was the penalty that Prometheus theft of fire until Hercules afterwards released him.
And Prometheus had a son Deucalion. He reigning in the regions about Phthia, married Pyrrha, the daughter of Pandora, the first woman fashioned by the gods. And when Zeus would destroy the men of the Bronze Age, Deucalion advice of Prometheus constructed a chest, and having stored it with provisions he embarked in it with Pyrrha. But Zeu heavy rain from heaven flooded the greater part of Greece, so that all men were destroyed, except a few who fled to t mountains in the neighbourhood and Peloponnesus was overwhelmed. But Deucalion, floating in the chest over the days and as many nights, drifted to Parnassus, and there, when the rain ceased, he landed and sacrificed to Zeus, the Escape. And Zeus sent Hermes to him and allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to get men.
And at the bidding of Zeus he took up stones and threw them over his head, and the stones which Deucalion threw and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women. Hence people were called metaphorically people (Laos) from laas, And Deucalion had children by Pyrrha, first Hellen, whose father some say was Zeus, and second Amphictyon, who rei Attica after Cranaus, and third a daughter Protogonia, who became the mother of Aethlius by Zeus. Hellen had Dorus, Aeolus by a nymph Orseis. Those who were called Greeks he named Hellenes after himself, and divided the country sons. Xuthus received Peloponnese and begat Achaeus and Ion by Creusa, daughter of Erechtheus, and from Achaeus Achaeans and lonians derive their names. Dorus received the country over against Peloponnese and called the settlers after himself.
Aeolus reigned over the regions about Thessaly and named the inhabitants Aeolians.

Germany/Scandinavia
In Norse mythology, there are two separate deluges. According to the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson, the first occurr dawn of time before the world was formed. Ymir, the first giant, was killed by the god Odin and his brothers he fell, so much blood flowed from his wounds that it drowned almost the entire race of giants with the exception of th Bergelmir and his wife. They escaped in a ship and survived, becoming the progenitors of a new race of giants. Ymir's then used to form the earth while his blood became the sea.
The second, in the Norse mythological time cycle, is destined to occur in the future during the final battle between the giants, known as Ragnarök. During this apocalyptic event, Jormungandr, the great World Serpent that lies beneath th surrounding Midgard, the realm of mortals, will rise up from the watery depths to join the conflict, resulting in a catas that will drown the land. However, following Ragnarök the earth will be reborn and a new age of humanity will begin.



The mythologist Brian Branston noted the similarities between this legend and an incident described in the Anglo-Saxo Beowulf, which had traditionally been associated with the biblical flood, so there may have been a corresponding incid broader Germanic mythology as well as in Anglo-Saxon mythology.
Irish
According to the apocryphal history of Ireland Lebor Gabála Érenn, the first inhabitants of Ireland led by Noah's grand Cessair were all except one wiped out by a flood 40 days after reaching the island. Later, after Partholon's and reached the island, another flood rose and killed all but thirty of the inhabitants, who scattered across the world. As Christian monks who first wrote the story down (it had previously been oral tradition), it is likely that references to th Noah were inserted into the story, in an attempt to Christianise it.
Finnish
In the Kalevala rune entitled "Haava" (The Wound, section 8),[17] Väinämöinen attempts a heroic feat that results in a wound, the blood from which covers the entire earth. This deluge is not emphasized in the Kalevala version redacted b Lönnrot, but the global quality of the flood is evident in original variants of the rune. In one variant collected in Ostrobothnia in 1803/04, the rune tells:
The blood came forth like a flood the gore ran like a river: there was no hummock and no high mountain that was not flooded all from Väinämöinen's toe from the holy hero's knee.[18]
In the analysis by Matti Kuusi, he notes that the rune's motifs of constructing a boat, a wound, and a flood have paral flood legends from around the world.[19]
Americas
Aztec
There are several variants of the Aztec story, many of them are questionable in accuracy or authenticity.
When the Sun Age came, there had passed 400 years. Then came 200 years, then 76. Then all mankind was drowned and turned to fishes. The water and the sky drew near each other. In a single day all was lost, and Four consumed all that there was of our flesh. The very mountains were swallowed up in the flood, and the waters rem tranquil during fifty and two springs. But before the flood began, Titlachahuan had warned the man Nota and his saying, 'Make no more pulque, but hollow a great cypress, into which you shall enter the month Tozoztli. The wa near the sky.' They entered, and when Titlacahuan had shut them in he said to the man, 'Thou shalt eat but a sin maize, and thy wife but one also'. And when they had each eaten one ear of maize, they prepared to go was tranquil.

Inca
In Inca mythology, Viracocha destroyed the giants with a Great Flood, and two people repopulated the earth. survived in sealed caves. See Unu Pachakuti.
Maya
In Maya mythology, from the Popol Vuh, Part 1, Chapter 3, Huracan ("one-legged") was a wind and storm god who ca Great Flood (of resin) after the first humans (made of wood) angered the gods (by being unable to worship them). He lived in the windy mists above the floodwaters and spoke the word "earth" until land came up again from the seas.
Later, in Part 3, Chapter 3&4,
Four men & four women repopulate the Quiche world after the flood all speaking the same language (but a confusing reference) and gather together in the same location where their speech is changed (affirmed several times) after which they disperse throughout the world.
Like many others, this account does not present an "Ark". A "Tower of Babel" depends upon the translation; some ren peoples arriving at a city, others, at a citadel.
Hopi



In Hopi mythology, the people moved away from Sotuknang, the creator, repeatedly. He destroyed the world by fire, a cold, and recreated it both times for the people that still followed the laws of creation, who survived by hiding undergr became corrupt and warlike a third time. As a result, Sotuknang guided the people to Spider Woman, and she cut dow reeds and sheltered the people in the hollow stems. Sotuknang then caused a great flood, and the people floated their reeds. The reeds came to rest on a small piece of land, and the people emerged, with as much food as they star people traveled on in their canoes, guided by their inner wisdom (which is said to come from Sotuknang, through the top of their head). They travelled to the northeast, passing progressively larger islands, until they came to the Fourth they reached the fourth world, the islands sank into the ocean.
Caddo
In Caddo mythology, four monsters grew in size and power until they touched the sky. At that time, a man heard a vo him to plant a hollow reed. He did so, and the reed grew very big very quickly. The man entered the reed with all good animals. Waters rose, and covered everything but the top of the reed and the heads of the monsters. A turtle the monsters by digging under them and uprooting them. The waters subsided, and winds dried the earth.
Menominee
In Menominee mythology, Manabus, the trickster, "fired by his lust for revenge" shot two underground gods when the play. When they all dived into the water, a huge flood arose. "The water rose up .... It knew very well where Manabus He runs, he runs; but the water, coming from Lake Michigan, chases him faster and faster, even as he runs up a moun climbs to the top of the lofty pine at its peak. Four times he begs the tree to grow just a little more, and four times it it can grow no more. But the water keeps climbing "up, up, right to his chin, and there it stopped": there was nothing stretching out to the horizon. And then Manabus, helped by diving animals, and especially the bravest of all, the Musk the world as we know it today.
Mi'kmaq
In Mi'kmaq mythology, evil and wickedness among men causes them to kill each other. This causes great sorrow to th sun-god, who weeps tears that become rains sufficient to trigger a deluge. The people attempt to survive by canoes, but only a single old man and woman survive to populate the earth.[20]
Polynesian
Several different flood stories are recorded among the Polynesians. None of them approach the scale of the biblical
The people of Ra'iatea tell of two friends, Te-aho-aroa and Ro'o, who went fishing and accidentally awoke the ocean go with their fish hooks. Angered, he vowed to sink Ra'iatea below the sea. Te-aho-aroa and Ro'o begged for forgiveness Ruahatu warned them that they could escape only by bringing their families to the islet of Toamarama. These set sail, the night, the island slipped under the ocean, only to rise again the next morning. Nothing survived except for these f erected sacred marae (temples) dedicated to the god Ruahatu.
A similar legend is found on Tahiti. No reason for the tragedy is given, but the whole island sunk beneath the sea exce Pitohiti. One human couple managed to flee there with their animals and survived.
In Hawaii, a human couple, Nu'u and Lili-noe, survived a flood on top of Mauna Kea on the Big Island. Nu'u made moon, to whom he mistakenly attributed his safety. Kane, the creator god, descended to earth on a rainbow, explaine mistake, and accepted his sacrifice.
In the Marquesas, the great war god Tu was angered by critical remarks made by his sister Hii-hia. His tears tore thro floor to the world below and created a torrent of rain carrying everything in its path. Only six people survived.
Hypotheses of origin of flood legends
The publication of The First Fossil Hunters by Adrienne Mayor, followed by Fossil Legends of the First Americans
hypothesis that flood stories have been inspired by ancient observations of fossil seashells and fish inland and on mou gain ground. Though the Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, and Chinese all commented in ancient writings about seashells impressions of fish that they found inland and/or in the mountains, it was Leonardo da Vinci who postulated that an deluge could not have caused the layered and neatly ordered strata he found in the Italian Apennines. The Greeks hyp that the earth had been covered by water several times, and noted the seashells and fish fossils that they found on m as the evidence for this belief. Native Americans also expressed this belief to early Europeans, though they had ideas down previously.[citation needed]
Some geologists believe that quite dramatic, greater than normal flooding of rivers in the distant past might legends. One of the latest, and quite controversial, hypotheses of this type is the Ryan-Pitman Theory, which argues f catastrophic deluge about 5600 BCE from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea. This has been the subject of discussion and a news article from National Geographic News in February 2009 reported that the flooding might have mild".[21]
There has also been speculation that a large tsunami in the Mediterranean Sea caused by the Thera eruption



1600 BCE geologically, was the historical basis for folklore that evolved into the Deucalion myth. However, the tsunam South Aegean Sea and Crete; it did not affect cities in the mainland of Greece such as Mycenae, Athens, and continued to prosper, therefore it had a local rather than a regionwide effect[22].
Another theory is that a meteor or comet crashed into the Indian Ocean in prehistoric times around 2800-3000 30-km undersea Burckle Crater and generated a giant tsunami that flooded coastal lands.[23]
The Biblical Deluge
Flood geology
Main article: Flood geology
Proponents of flood geology contend that the Biblical Deluge, Noah's Ark, is to be taken literally in which most observe processes, like fossilization and sedimentary strata, are a later result of this event.
While some people hold the belief there was a worldwide flood, flood geology itself has been rejected by mainstream biologists, and historians, many of whom consider it pseudoscience.[24] Though at one time even prominent workers i archaeology were willing to argue support for flood geology,[25][26] this view is no longer widely held.[27]
Sumerian king list flood
Main article: Sumerian flood myth
The Sumerian king list mentions a flood which divides older, possibly mythic kingships from more recent and possibly kingships in Sumer. In the 1920s, archaeologists associated this historic flood with a layer of riverine deposits which i Sumerian settlements over a wide area of southern Mesopotamia. This led to speculation at the time that the flood me Noah's Ark had been found, by trying to connect the Ancient Near East flood legend (beginning with the Sumerian and continuing with the later Atra-Hasis legend, the Utnapishtim episode in the Epic of Gilgamesh, and Noah's Ark) wi historic flood. However, there is no evidence that the flood legend in the Eridu Genesis was the same as the historic mentioned in the king list, or that the Sumerians themselves ever linked them together.
Popular Culture
As a well-known part of Genesis the flood myth has appeared in various films and stories. A notable example is Heinlein's Lost Legacy, which combines a worldwide flood with the sinking of the Lost Continents of Atlantis and searching for Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat have been filmed and shown on television.
