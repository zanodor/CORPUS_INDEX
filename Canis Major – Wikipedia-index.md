Canis Major is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. In the second century,
it was included in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern
constellations. Its name is Latin for "greater dog" in contrast to Canis Minor, the "lesser
dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the
hunter through the sky. The Milky Way passes through Canis Major and several open
clusters lie within its borders, most notably M41.
Canis Major contains Sirius, the
brightest star in the night sky, known
as the "dog star". It is bright because
of its proximity to the Solar System. In
contrast, the other bright stars of the
constellation are stars of great
distance and high luminosity. At
magnitude 1.5, Epsilon Canis Majoris
(Adhara) is the second-brightest star
of the constellation and the brightest
source of extreme ultraviolet radiation
in the night sky. Next in brightness are
the yellow-white supergiant Delta
(Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant
Beta (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white
supergiants Eta (Aludra) at 2.4 and
Omicron1 at 3.0, and white
spectroscopic binary Zeta (Furud),
also at 3.0. The red hypergiant VY
Canis Majoris is one of the largest
stars known, while the neutron star RX
J0720.4-3125 has a radius of a mere
5 km.

History and mythology



KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, was
seen as an arrow aiming towards
Orion, while the southern stars of
Canis Major and a part of Puppis were
viewed as a bow, named BAN in the
Three Stars Each tablets, dating to
around 1100 BC. In the later
compendium of Babylonian astronomy
and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the
arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the
warrior Ninurta, and the bow with
Ishtar, daughter of Enlil.[2] Ninurta was
linked to the later deity Marduk, who
was said to have slain the ocean
goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and
worshipped as the principal deity in
Babylon.[3] The Ancient Greeks
replaced the bow and arrow depiction
with that of a dog.[4]
Sirius A, the brightest star in the night sky, lies in Canis Major.
In Greek Mythology, Canis Major represented the dog Laelaps, a gift from Zeus to Europa;

Cephalus, so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky.
[5]
It was also considered
to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs,
[6]
pursuing Lepus the Hare or helping Orion fight
Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient
Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second
dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter.
[5]
Canis Syrius was the
name used in the 1521 Alfonsine tables.
[5]
The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as Custos Europae, the dog guarding Europa but
failing to prevent her abduction by Jupiter in the form of a bull, and as Janitor Lethaeus,
"the watchdog".
[7]
In medieval Arab astronomy, the constellation became al-Kalb al-Akbar,
"the Greater Dog", transcribed as Alcheleb Alachbar by 17th century writer Edmund
Chilmead. Islamic scholar Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī referred to Orion as Kalb al-Jabbār, "the
Dog of the Giant".

Among the Merazig of Tunisia, shepherds note six constellations that
mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called Merzem, includes the stars
of Canis Major and Canis Minor and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.

In non-western astronomy
In Chinese astronomy, the modern constellation of Canis Major is located in the Vermilion
Bird (ܖො๟ɯ; Nán Fāng Zhū Què), where the stars were classified in several separate
asterisms of stars. The Military Market (敎૱; Jūnshì) was a circular pattern of stars
containing Nu

[9]
The Wild Cockerel (ᰀ櫚;
Yějī) was at the centre of the Military Market, although it is uncertain which stars depicted
what. Schlegel reported that the stars Omicron and Pi Canis Majoris might have been
them,
[10]
while Beta or Nu

have also been proposed.

Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism
Húshǐ (ୢᎡ ), the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing Delta,



Epsilon, Eta and Kappa Canis Majoris and Delta Velorum. Alternatively, the arrow was
depicted by Omicron2 and Eta and aiming at Sirius (the Wolf), while the bow comprised
Kappa, Epsilon, Sigma, Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and Pi and Omicron Puppis.[13]
Both the Māori people and the people of the Tuamotus recognized the figure of Canis
Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. Te
Huinga-o-Rehua, also called Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua and Te Kahui-Takurua, ("The
Assembly of Rehua" or "The Assembly of Sirius") was a Māori constellation that included
both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars.[14][15] Related was
Taumata-o-Rehua, also called Pukawanui, the Mirror of Rehua, formed from an undefined
group of stars in Canis Major.[16][17] They called Sirius Rehua and Takarua, corresponding
to two of the names for the constellation, though Rehua was a name applied to other stars
in various Māori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies.[18][19] The Tuamotu people
called Canis Major Muihanga-hetika-o-Takurua, "the abiding assemblage of Takarua".[20]
The Tharumba people of the Shoalhaven River saw three stars of Canis Major as Wunbula
(Bat) and his two wives Murrumbool (Mrs Brown Snake) and Moodtha (Mrs Black Snake);
bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a
wombat down its hole. He spears them and all three are placed in the sky as the
constellation Munowra.[21] To the Boorong people of Victoria, Sigma Canis Majoris was
Unurgunite (which has become the official name of this star[22]), and its flanking stars
Delta and Epsilon were his two wives.[23] The moon (Mityan, "native cat") sought to lure
the further wife (Epsilon) away, but Unurgunite assaulted him and he has been wandering
the sky ever since.[24]
Canis Major is a constellation in the Southern Hemisphere's summer (or northern
hemisphere's winter) sky, bordered by Monoceros (which lies between it and Canis Minor)
to the north, Puppis to the east and southeast, Columba to the southwest, and Lepus to
the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the
International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'CMa'.[25] The official constellation boundaries,
as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a quadrilateral; in the equatorial
coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between
06h 12.5m and 07h 27.5m, while the declination coordinates are between −11.03° and
−33.25°.[1] Covering 380 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 43rd of the 88
currently-recognized constellations in size.[26]

Stars
See also: List of stars in Canis Major
Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include
Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), the brightest star in the night sky, as well as three other stars
above magnitude 2.0.[6] Furthermore, two other stars are thought to have previously
outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around
4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million
years ago. Another, NR Canis Majoris, will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87
million years' time.[27]
The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Omicron to
label the most prominent stars in the constellation, including three adjacent stars as Nu
and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron,[28] while subsequent observers designated
further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from
Central Europe.[3] Bayer's countryman Johann Elert Bode later added Sigma, Tau and
Omega;[29] the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille added lettered stars a to k
(though none are in use today).[29] John Flamsteed numbered 31 stars, with 3 Canis Majoris
being placed by Lacaille into Columba as Delta Columbae (Flamsteed had not recognised
Features



Columba as a distinct constellation).[30] He also labelled two stars—his 10 and 13 Canis
Majoris—as Kappa1 and Kappa2 respectively, but subsequent cartographers such as
Francis Baily and John Bevis dropped the fainter former star, leaving Kappa2 as the sole
Kappa.[28] Flamsteed's listing of Nu1, Nu2, Nu3, Xi1, Xi2, Omicron1 and Omicron2 have all
remained in use.[31]

Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky at apparent magnitude −1.46 and one of the
closest stars to Earth at a distance of 8.6 light-years. Its name comes from the Greek word
for "scorching" or "searing". Sirius is also a binary star; its companion Sirius B is a white
dwarf with a magnitude of 8.4—10,000 times fainter than Sirius A to observers on
Earth.[32] The two orbit each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in
1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the
basis for the ancient Egyptian calendar.[6] The star marked the Great Dog's mouth on
Bayer's star atlas.[33]
Flanking Sirius are Beta and Gamma Canis Majoris. Also called Mirzam or Murzim, Beta is a
blue-white Beta Cephei variable star of magnitude 2.0, which varies by a few hundredths
of a magnitude over a period of six hours.[34] Mirzam is 500 light-years from Earth, and its
traditional name means "the announcer", referring to its position as the "announcer" of
Sirius, as it rises a few minutes before Sirius does.[6] Gamma, also known as Muliphein, is a
fainter star of magnitude 4.12, in reality a blue-white bright giant of spectral type B8IIe
located 441 light-years from earth.[35] Iota Canis Majoris, lying between Sirius and Gamma,
is another star that has been classified as a Beta Cephei variable, varying from magnitude
4.36 to 4.40 over a period of 1.92 hours.[36] It is a remote blue-white supergiant star of
spectral type B3Ib, around 46,000 times as luminous as the sun and, at 2500 light-years
distant, 300 times further away than Sirius.[37]



Epsilon, Omicron2, Delta, and Eta Canis Majoris were called Al Adzari "the virgins" in
medieval Arabic tradition.[38] Marking the dog's right thigh on Bayer's atlas is Epsilon Canis
Majoris,[33] also known as Adhara. At magnitude 1.5, it is the second-brightest star in Canis
Major and the 23rd-brightest star in the sky. It is a blue-white supergiant of spectral type
B2Iab, around 404 light-years from Earth.[39] This star is one of the brightest known
extreme ultraviolet sources in the sky.[40] It is a binary star; the secondary is of magnitude
7.4. Its traditional name means "the virgins", having been transferred from the group of
stars to Epsilon alone.[41] Nearby is Delta Canis Majoris, also called Wezen. It is a yellow
white supergiant of spectral type F8Iab and magnitude 1.84, around 1605 light-years from
Earth.[42] With a traditional name meaning "the weight", Wezen is 17 times as massive and
50,000 times as luminous as the Sun. If located in the centre of the Solar System, it would
extend out to Earth as its diameter is 200 times that of the Sun. Only around 10 million
years old, Wezen has stopped fusing hydrogen in its core. Its outer envelope is beginning
to expand and cool, and in the next 100,000 years it will become a red supergiant as its
core fuses heavier and heavier elements. Once it has a core of iron, it will collapse and
explode as a supernova.[43] Nestled between Adhara and Wezen lies Sigma Canis Majoris,
known as Unurgunite to the Boorong and Wotjobaluk people,[23] a red supergiant of
spectral type K7Ib that varies irregularly between magnitudes 3.43 and 3.51.[44]
Also called Aludra, Eta Canis Majoris is a blue-white supergiant of spectral type B5Ia with a
luminosity 176,000 times and diameter around 80 times that of the Sun.[45] Classified as
an Alpha Cygni type variable star, Aludra varies in brightness from magnitude 2.38 to 2.48
over a period of 4.7 days.[46] It is located 1120 light-years away. To the west of Adhara lies
3.0-magnitude Zeta Canis Majoris or Furud, around 362 light-years distant from Earth.[47]
It is a spectroscopic binary, whose components orbit each other every 1.85 years, the
combined spectrum indicating a main star of spectral type B2.5V.[48]
Between these stars and Sirius lie Omicron1, Omicron2, and Pi Canis Majoris. Omicron2 is a
massive supergiant star about 21 times as massive as the Sun.[49] Only 7 million years
old,[49] it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now processing
helium.[50] It is an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations,
which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day
interval.[51] Omicron1 is an orange K-type supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an
irregular variable star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99.[52] Around 18
times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 65,000 times its luminosity.[53]
North of Sirius lie Theta and Mu Canis Majoris, Theta being the most northerly star with a
Bayer designation in the constellation.[54] Around 8 billion years old, it is an orange giant of



spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the
Sun's diameter.[55] Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light-years distant,[56]
its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1
magnitude bluish star.[57] The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III,[56] while the
companion is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V.[58] Nu Canis Majoris is a
yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.7, 278 light-years away; it is at the threshold of
naked-eye visibility. It has a companion of magnitude 8.1.[6]
At the southern limits of the constellation lie Kappa and Lambda Canis Majoris. Although of
similar spectra and nearby each other as viewed from Earth, they are unrelated.[26] Kappa
is a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable of spectral type B2Vne,[59] which brightened by 50%
between 1963 and 1978, from magnitude 3.96 or so to 3.52.[60] It is around 659 light-years
distant.[61] Lambda is a blue-white B-type main sequence dwarf with an apparent
magnitude of 4.48 located around 423 light-years from Earth.[62] It is 3.7 times as wide as
and 5.5 times as massive as the Sun, and shines with 940 times its luminosity.[54]
Very Large Telescope image of the surroundings of VY Canis Majoris
Canis Major is also home to many variable stars. EZ Canis Majoris is a Wolf–Rayet star of
spectral type WN4 that varies between magnitudes 6.71 and 6.95 over a period of 3.766
days; the cause of its variability is unknown but thought to be related to its stellar wind and
rotation.[63] VY Canis Majoris is a remote red hypergiant located approximately 3,800 light
years away from Earth. It is one of largest stars known (sometimes described as the largest
known)[64] and is also one of most luminous with a radius varying from 1,420 to 2,200
times the Sun's radius, and a luminosity around 300,000 times greater than the Sun. Its
current mass is about 17 ± 8 solar masses, having shed material from an initial mass of 25
32 solar masses.[65][66] VY CMa is also surrounded by a red reflection nebula that has
been made by the material expelled by the strong stellar winds of its central star. W Canis
Majoris is a type of red giant known as a carbon star—a semiregular variable, it ranges



between magnitudes 6.27 and 7.09 over a period of 160 days.[67] A cool star, it has a
surface temperature of around 2,900 K and a radius 234 times that of the Sun, its distance
estimated at 1,444–1,450 light-years from Earth.[68] At the other extreme in size is RX
J0720.4-3125, a neutron star with a radius of around 5 km.[69] Exceedingly faint, it has an
apparent magnitude of 26.6.[70] Its spectrum and temperature appear to be mysteriously
changing over several years. The nature of the changes are unclear, but it is possible they
were caused by an event such as the star's absorption of an accretion disc.[69]
Tau Canis Majoris is a Beta Lyrae-type eclipsing multiple star system that varies from
magnitude 4.32 to 4.37 over 1.28 days.[71] Its four main component stars are hot O-type
stars, with a combined mass 80 times that of the Sun and shining with 500,000 times its
luminosity, but little is known of their individual properties. A fifth component, a magnitude
10 star, lies at a distance of 13,000 astronomical units (0.21 ly). The system is only 5 million
years old.[72] UW Canis Majoris is another Beta Lyrae-type star 3000 light-years from
Earth; it is an eclipsing binary that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 5.3 to a
maximum of 4.8. It has a period of 4.4 days;[6] its components are two massive hot blue
stars, one a blue supergiant of spectral type O7.5-8 Iab, while its companion is a slightly
cooler, less evolved and less luminous supergiant of spectral type O9.7Ib. The stars are
200,000 and 63,000 times as luminous as the Sun. However the fainter star is the more
massive at 19 solar masses to the primary's 16.[73] R Canis Majoris is another eclipsing
binary that varies from magnitude 5.7 to 6.34 over 1.13 days,[74] with a third star orbiting
these two every 93 years. The shortness of the orbital period and the low ratio between
the two main components make this an unusual Algol-type system.[75]
Seven star systems have been found to have planets. Nu2 Canis Majoris is an ageing
orange giant of spectral type K1III of apparent magnitude 3.91 located around 64 light
years distant.[76] Around 1.5 times as massive and 11 times as luminous as the Sun, it is
orbited over a period of 763 days by a planet 2.6 times as massive as Jupiter.[77] HD
47536 is likewise an ageing orange giant found to have a planetary system—echoing the
fate of the Solar System in a few billion years as the Sun ages and becomes a giant.[78]
Conversely, HD 45364 is a star 107 light-years distant that is a little smaller and cooler
than the Sun, of spectral type G8V, which has two planets discovered in 2008. With orbital
periods of 228 and 342 days, the planets have a 3x2 orbital resonance, which helps
stabilise the system.[79] HD 47186 is another sunlike star with two planets; the inner—HD
47186 b—takes four days to complete an orbit and has been classified as a Hot Neptune,
while the outer—HD 47186 c—has an eccentric 3.7-year period orbit and has a similar
mass to Saturn.[80] HD 43197 is a sunlike star around 183 light-years distant that has a
Jupiter-size planet with an eccentric orbit.[81]



Z Canis Majoris is a star system a mere 300,000 years old composed of two pre-main
sequence stars—a FU Orionis star and a Herbig Ae/Be star,[82] which has brightened
episodically by two magnitudes to magnitude 8 in 1987, 2000, 2004 and 2008.[83] The
more massive Herbig Ae/Be star is enveloped in an irregular roughly spherical cocoon of
dust that has an inner diameter of 20 AU (3.0 × 109 km) and outer diameter of 50 AU
(7.5 × 109 km). The cocoon has a hole in it through which light shines that covers an angle
of 5 to 10 degrees of its circumference. Both stars are surrounded by a large envelope of
in-falling material left over from the original cloud that formed the system. Both stars are
emitting jets of material, that of the Herbig Ae/Be star being much larger—11.7 light-years
long.[84] Meanwhile, FS Canis Majoris is another star with infra-red emissions indicating a
compact shell of dust, but it appears to be a main-sequence star that has absorbed
material from a companion. These stars are thought to be significant contributors to
interstellar dust.[85]
Deep-sky objects
The band of the Milky Way goes through Canis Major, with only patchy obscurement by
interstellar dust clouds. It is bright in the northeastern corner of the constellation, as well
as in a triangular area between Adhara, Wezen and Aludra, with many stars visible in
binoculars. Canis Major boasts several open clusters.[86] The only Messier object is M41
(NGC 2287), an open cluster with a combined visual magnitude of 4.5, around 2300 light
years from Earth. Located 4 degrees south of Sirius, it contains contrasting blue, yellow
and orange stars and covers an area the apparent size of the full moon—in reality around
25 light-years in diameter.[87] Its most luminous stars have already evolved into giants. The
brightest is a 6.3-magnitude star of spectral type K3. Located in the field is 12 Canis
Majoris, though this star is only 670 light-years distant.[88] NGC 2360, known as Caroline's
Cluster after its discoverer Caroline Herschel, is an open cluster located 3.5 degrees west
of Muliphein and has a combined apparent magnitude of 7.2. Around 15 light-years in
diameter, it is located 3700 light-years away from Earth,[89] and has been dated to around
2.2 billion years old.[90] NGC 2362 is a small, compact open cluster, 5200 light-years from
Earth. It contains about 60 stars, of which Tau Canis Majoris is the brightest member.[6]
Located around 3 degrees northeast of Wezen, it covers an area around 12 light-years in
diameter, though the stars appear huddled around Tau when seen through binoculars. It is
a very young open cluster as its member stars are only a few million years old. Lying 2
degrees southwest of NGC 2362 is NGC 2354 a fainter open cluster of magnitude 6.5,
with around 15 member stars visible with binoculars.[87] Located around 30' northeast of
NGC 2360,[91] NGC 2359 (Thor's Helmet or the Duck Nebula) is a relatively bright emission



nebula in Canis Major, with an approximate magnitude of 10, which is 10,000 light-years
from Earth. The nebula is shaped by HD 56925, an unstable Wolf–Rayet star embedded
within it.[92]
ESO 489-056 is an irregular dwarf galaxy, located 16 million light-years distant.[93]
In 2003, an overdensity of stars in the region was announced to be the Canis Major Dwarf,
the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it
represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation in the thin and thick disk and
spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae
variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a
separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy.[94] On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC
2298—which appears to be part of the Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal
poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of
extragalactic origin.[95]
NGC 2207 and IC 2163 are a pair of face-on interacting spiral galaxies located 125 million
light-years from Earth. About 40 million years ago, the two galaxies had a close encounter
and are now moving farther apart; nevertheless, the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be
incorporated into NGC 2207. As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed,
sparking extensive star formation in both galaxies.[96] Supernovae have been observed in
NGC 2207 in 1975 (type Ia SN 1975a),[97] 1999 (the type Ib SN 1999ec),[98] 2003 (type 1b
supernova SN 2003H),[99] and 2013 (type II supernova SN 2013ai).[100] Located 16 million
light-years distant,[93] ESO 489-056 is an irregular dwarf- and low-surface-brightness
galaxy that has one of the lowest metallicities known.[101]
