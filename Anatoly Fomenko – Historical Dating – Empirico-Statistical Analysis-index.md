FOREWORD
Today the methods of applied statistics have penetrated very different fields of knowledge, including the investigation of texts of various origins. These "texts" may be considered as signal sequences of different kinds, long genetic codes, graphic representations (which may be coded and represented by a "text"), as well as actual narrative texts (for example, historical chronicles, originals, documents, etc.). One ofthe most important problems arising here is to recognize dependent text, i.e., texts which have a measure of "resemblance", arising from some kind of "common origin". For instance, in pattern-recognition problems, it is essential to identify from a large set of "patterns" a pattern that is "closest" to a given one; in studying long signal sequences, it is important to recognize "homogeneous subsequences" and the places of their junction. This includes, in particular, the well-known change-point problem, which is given considerable attention in mathematical statistics and the theory of stochastic processes. As applied to the study of narrative texts, the problem of recognizing dependent and independent texts (e.g., chronicles) leads to the problem offinding texts having a common source, i.e., the same original (such texts are naturally called dependent), or, on the contrary, having different sources (such texts are naturally called independent). Clearly, such problems are exceedingly complicated, and therefore the appearance of new empirico-statistical recognition methods which, along with the classical approaches, may prove useful in concrete studies (e.g., source determination) is welcome. The present book by A.T. Fomenko, professor of pure mathematics, is mainly aimed at developing such new methods to be applied to recognizing dependent and independent narrative texts and dating them (with respect to texts with known reliable dates). The author proposes a new approach to the problem ofrecognizing dependent and independent narrative (historical) texts based on the several new empiricostatistical models (regularities) which he has discovered during his extensive statistical emperiments involving various quantitative characteristics of concrete texts, chronicles, originals, and so forth. Verification of these models (statistical hypotheses) on concrete chronicles confirmed the efficacy of the models and made it possible to put forward new methos for dating texts (more precisely, for dating events described in the texts). The approach proposed in this book is nonstandard and requires attention and diligence on the part of the reader to new and probably unfamiliar logical constructions. At the same time, the basic ideas of the author seem quite natural

Xll Foreword
from the viewpoint of modern mathematical statistics and can easily be included in the conceptual system of applied statisticians. The author's scientific results and ideas are very interesting, and perhaps already today we may speak of the appearance of a new (and rather unexpected) scientific trend in applied statistics whose development is of undisputed importance. This book is a result of a tremendous amount of work done by the author and his colleagues, most of whom specialize in mathematical statistics and its applications. Since the book is devoted to problems at the interface of several branches of science, the necessity of establishing contact between people of different professional backgrounds becomes obvious. Many concepts and terms customary to specialists in one branch require translation into the language of specialists in another field ofresearch. This should be borne in mind by representatives ofboth the natural sciences and the humanities. Such "difficulties of communication" are typical and must be successfully overcome with any mixed group ofscientists working on joint problems. One may hope that many of the readers of this book will join to form such an interdisciplinary group in order to successfully continue the studies started here by this well-known mathematician. Along with developing new empirico-statistical methods for dating events, the book also includes applications to the problem of modern scientific argumentation of the chronology of past events. One should clearly distinguish between the main statistical result obtained by the author (namely, the layered structure of the global "chronological map" and its representation as a "sum" of four layers) and its various interpretations and substantiations. Stating hypotheses and providing substantiations ofresults are beyond the scope ofexact mathematical knowledge, and therefore special care should be taken in formulating conclusions concerning the possible structure of a new "statistical chronology of antiquity". The author has repeatedly insisted upon the necessity of critical analysis and upon distinguishing between strictly established facts and hypotheses or interpretations concerning these facts. The concepts proposed by the author are new, sometimes unexpected, and deserve extensive and thorough investigation. The book is written at a high scientific level, it is a unique phenomenon in the scientific literature in the field of applications of mathematical statistics, and the reader will not remain indifferent to it. The book also enables us to get to know the engaging personality of its author-mathematician and investigator of history .... I hope that, after perusing the first few pages of the book, the reader will be intrigued to read to the end with unabating interest. He will, at the very least, get to know an interesting set of scientific problems and, perhaps, will even engage in further investigations in this new and promising field of science.

PREFACE
This book presents new empirico-statistical methods for the discovery of dependences between texts, on which we base our dating methods. As one of various possible applications, the datings (or dates) of certain events described in ancient and medieval texts are analyzed. The problem of recognizing dependences (and dependent texts) arises in many branches of applied statistics, linguistics, physics, genetics, and so forth. For example, as applied to source research, the discovery of dependent texts with a common primary source or original (which may not have survived) is of considerable interest. On the other hand, it is useful to have an idea which texts may be called independent or are based on substantially different primary sources and archival data. Meanwhile, the concept of text itself can be treated extremely differently. We can consider a sequence of symbols, signals, codes (of various kinds; for example, genetic codes in DNA chains) as a text, where the general problem in the search for "dependent texts" consists of finding "similar" portions in a given long signal sequence, i.e., textual fragments "duplicating" each other.
Today, there are many methods for finding dependences of this sort. We suggest certain new empirico-statistical procedures which can prove useful both in analyzing narrative texts (such as annals and chronicles) and in studying biological codes to find so-called homologous fragments, and so on. For the reader's convenience, we divide the contents into several "topics", which may be helpful in getting oriented in the material and in separating reliable statistical evidence from hypotheses. This devision is arbitrary in the sense that the highlights listed in the following are intimately related to each other. Therefore, it would be more correct to speak of the book's "fibres", rather than of its parts. The book's chapters receive different emphasis, and I will briefly describe this accentuation here. I hope that the reader will be able to relate each fragment of the book to some particular "fibre", and, in particular, to make out the author's attitude toward each fibre.
The first fibre. The problem of discovering statistically covert dependences and dependent texts is solved, to which purpose a number of new statistical models (or hypotheses) are formulated. They are then checked against sufficiently extensive experimental data consisting of concrete narrative texts like annals or chronicles. It turns out that the suggested models can be confirmed.

XlV Preface
In other words, we managed to discover interesting statistical regularities controlling the chroniclers' process of creating long narrative texts. The discovery of these laws is one of the principal results of our work. And on their basis, the methods for dating the events described are offered, for which the texts under investigation are statistically compared with those whose dating is undisputed. The methods are then verified against sufficiently extensive concrete material. We see that their application to texts describing the events from the 13th to the 20th century supports the efficiency of the method. Namely, the statistical datings obtained are consistent with those that had been known previously and were established by traditional methods. In particular, textual pairs originating from common primary sources, and known a priori as dependent between the 13th and the 20th century, also turn out to be dependent from the point of view of our methods; and pairs of texts known as positively independent prove to be independent from the standpoint of our methods as well.
The discovery of the laws that govern the distribution of information in large historical texts, with the establishment and experimental verification (based on these laws) of new dating methods (there being eight of them at present}, is the first basic result of our work. Certainly, the dates we obtained cannot be regarded as absolute and final. Therefore, we will speak in the following only of "statistical datings", although, for brevity, we will sometimes omit the term "statistical", which is always implied. We thereby regard the obtained empirico-statistical dates only as a formal result of the statistical experiments carried out with narrative texts and do not believe that they are undisputed. Meanwhile, the consistency of these dates with those known earlier and obtained by the classical methods points to the objective character of our results.
The second fibre. This fibre can be called "critical". Here, we analyze the traditional datings of events of the ancient and medieval history of Europe, Egypt, and the Mediterranean. To make it convenient for the reader, we gather here the vast data scattered throughout the scientific literature, known to the specialists of various disciplines (however, often not of general common knowledge), and shall reveal the serious difficulties on the way to justifying the dates of certain ancient events. We shall inform the reader of the fundamental research of the remarkable Russian scientist and universal scholar N.A. Morozov (1854-1946), Honorary Member of the USSR Academy of Science, who was the first to pose and fully formulate the problem of justifying ancient chronology by means of the methods of natural science, and who collected enormous critical material, putting forward daring hypotheses. We also speak of Isaac Newton's chronological research (questioning the dates of many ancient events), of well-known representatives of the critical school in chronology, and of various others working in the field. We then let major specialists in archaeology, source research, or numismatics speak and often resort to quoting and supplying the opinions of well-known scientists, juxtaposing different points of view so that the reader



Preface xv
can form his own attitude toward the problems touched upon. The analysis of the dates of ancient events is the basic application of the empirico-statistical methods we worked out. I was therefore forced to analyze possibly all preserved versions of the datings of particular events. As a matter of fact, ancient and medieval texts often differ with respect to the dates of many important events. Attempting to stay as close as possible to the "original" versions (and perhaps to reconstruct them), we usually preferred the versions established in the chronological documents from the 11th to the 16th century. The chronologists of that time were nearer to the ancient events described, which is very important. The versions recorded between the 17th and the 20th century are often the consequence of later, secondary treatment, sometimes blurring the original chronological scheme. The reader should always remember this when looking at the dates given in this book. Let me clarify this thought. Consider the evolution in time of historical documents and that of attitudes toward the datings of the described events. In the absence of a unique system for denoting dates in antiquity and the Middle Ages, the same events and documents could be dated differently by different chronologists belonging to different epochs. Let an event occur in the year to and be fixed in a document X written in t 0 ( or around this time) by a contemporary. X starts "living" when generations succeed each other. Another chronicler living in a later year t could no longer have access to all the necessary information and might "calculate" the date of an event. Denote by D(to, t) the date ascribed to an event in X, and actually occurring in to, by a chronicler who lived in the year t. It is clear that D(t0 , t) _can be different from to by some positive or negative value. The chronicler's version of the date can turn out to be older (then D(t0 ,t) is less than to) or, on the contrary, younger (then D(to, t) is greater than t). Thus, D(t0 , t) establishes the point of view elaborated by the chronicler in t with respect to the datings pertaining to X. It is obvious that D(t0 , t) is dependent either of t0 or t. We can assume that
D(to, to) = to, i.e., the contemporaries mostly date the contemporary events correctly. Let us construct the graph of the dependence of D(t0 , t) on t for a fixed to. We then obtain the visual representation of the evolution of the later chroniclers' view of dating an event actually occurring in t0 . It is convenient to represent it in the form shown in Fig. A. Dating the event t0 , given by the contemporary chronologists, is denoted by D(t0 , 1986). In other words, D(to, 1986) indicates the modern version of the dating if the event actually occurred in to. Of course, D(to, 1986) can be different from the true dating, for example, be more ancient or younger. Since the same event in to could be described by the contemporaries in several different documents (this being the typical situation), these individual versions start existing individually as separate texts not related to each other from the viewpoint of subsequent generations. We have represented this fact schematically in Fig. B by doubling or repeating some events and their datings several times. The further evolution of each version is represented by its own

curve, each emanating from the same diagonal but subsequently behaving absolutely independently. Meanwhile, different versions of the description of an event, outwardly totally different, can diverge far from each other from the standpoint of later chronologists. The complete evolution of datings of ancient events is given in Fig. C. Each subsequent epoch finds its own attitude toward the datings of the past events. These versions can vary substantially with time (we give examples of this in the book). Starting with the period from the 16th to the 17th century (see Fig. C), the chronological version of ancient times suggested by I. Scaliger and D. Petavius, is being "stabilized",

and the modern point of view coincides, in its basic features, with their chronology. This circumstance shows in the increasing straightening of the "alignment" of the dating trajectories. Today, we have assimilated only this version. However, very little is known about all the previous versions, which often differ sharply from today's. In other words, we are only well aware of the topmost line for the dates D(to, 1986) and know very little of other lines, which obviously make up the bulk of the diagram. Thus, the enormous base of the chronological iceberg is hidden, within which the modern version of ancient chronology has been formed. The basic question formulated in the critical fibre of the book (the second "fibre") is related only to the underwater part. It is in this sense that we paid so much attention to the ancient chronological versions of the l0th- to 15th-century scientists. We now elucidate what is meant by "correct" , or "authentic" , chronology in terms of the graphs in Figs. A, B, and C. It is the chronology in which the evolution of the date of an ancient event would be represented by approximately vertical lines (see Fig. D). Only in this case can the dates accepted today be regarded as realistic. To verify whether today's ancient chronology satisfies this condition, we should exhibit chronological tables associated with each horizontal line in Fig. C, made up by subsequent chronologists of ancient times. In other words, we should find the originals of those ancient

chronological versions forming the steps of a staircase which the dates were "ascending" . Meanwhile, we have to see that the transition from each version to the previous or subsequent one is represented by vertical lines in Fig. C. However, an attempt to descend into the past on these "steps", say by jumping over the 20 to 30 years that make up a generation, permits us to move only to the 12th and 13th centuries (with the "staircase" breaking earlier than that). Here we only discover "dating" of pieces that are not united into chronological tables preserved until today, and which fix the viewpoints of the ancient chronologists. Earlier than approximately the 13th century, no sequence of "shorter" predecessors of the chronological table can be found. It is desirable that the "shortening" of the table (respectively, its "extension") occurred approximately by 20 to 30 years, in the hope that the events of this time were described by a contemporary. The important characteristic of the second "fibre" is that the critical material is gathered only here. It thus acquires a new quality and permits us to embrace a larger volume of critical data on the basis of one point of view, accumulated in special works on ancient chronology. We assume that the reader is at least roughly familiar with tradtional ancient chronology (having studied it at school, university,



Preface XIX
etc.) In general, we do not repeat the traditional version, since we believe it to be known by everyone, but rather focus our attention on the account and criticisms of the competing versions, which are sometimes much different from the traditional one and were developed by many scientists between the 16th and the 20th century. Within the framework of the second "fibre", we also supply a brief analysis of the traditional dating methods based on archaeological or radiocarbon data, which is of use if the reader would like to estimate the degree of reliability and accuracy. We shall also pay much attention to the dating of events that are about one, two, or three thousand years old and will demontrate, again_/ by citing a number of authors, the difficulties that arise. Dating of material more than three thousand years old is beyond the scope of this book.
The third fibre. The author has constructed the so-called global chronological diagram (GCD), which can be regarded as a sufficiently complete and traditional "textbook" for ancient and medieval chronology. All the basic events of ancient history with their traditional dates, lists of the names of principal characters, and so forth, have been plotted on the time axis, and the basic preserved primary sources marked for each epoch. The diagram contains tens of thousands of dates, names, references. Occupying an area of several tens of square metres, it is a convenient collection of statistical data and a guidebook to the building of the traditional version. The graphic representation along the time axis of the principal dates proved useful for the statistical experiments. Since the GCD contains too much material, it was included in this book only in abbreviated form as short tables or graphs and is often replaced by this shorter version. We stress once again that the GCD is based on the traditional dating of ancient events, arising from the Scaliger and Petavius chronology.
The fourth fibre. The whole set of empirico-statistical methods we developed was applied to the GCD statistical material (see the first "fibre"). All possible pairs of time intervals (epochs) along with the basic texts describing them were considered, and the texts were statistically examined and compared. The "proximity coefficients" or textual "dependence coefficients" were subsequently calculated. If the dependence coefficient for two texts X and Y was the same (in order) as for two a priori, positively dependent texts from the 13th to the 20th century, then X and Y along with the associated time intervals were called "statistically dependent". This was represented in the GCD by denoting the corresponding time segments by the same symbols, for example, by the same letter T. The symbols were chosen arbitrarily. However, if the proximity coefficient was the same (in order) as for two a priori independent texts from the 13th to the 20th century, then X and Y were termed "statistically independent" and hence represented by noncoincident symbols like the letters H and C. We would like to make it clear that by investigating experimentally reliably dated texts describing the 13th to the 20th century, it was discovered that the proximity coefficients distinguish between



XX Preface
a priori dependent and independent texts. For example, one of these coefficients, p(X, Y), did not exceed 10-8 for two texts known previously as dependent and was not less than 10-3 for two surely independent texts, which shows the difference of about 4-5 orders. Now, comparing two arbitrary texts X and Y, we can say whether the value of the coefficient is in the zone for dependent or independent texts. It can also be in the zone of "neutral" texts. It goes without saying that the indicated bounds for the values of the coefficient have been found experimentally. Further discovery of dependent and independent texts is then carried out within the framework of the experimental material (which is, though, sufficiently large). For vast computational experiments, the GCD revealed pairs of statistically dependent texts and the corresponding epochs. The results of applying different methods turned out (and this is very important) to be remarkably consistent; namely, if a pair of texts (and periods) were statistically dependent from the standpoint of one method, then they were also dependent from the point of view of other methods applicable, in principle, to the tests in question. This consistency seems to be important. Our methods discovered no unexpected, formerly unknown duplicates of documents belonging to the period from the 13th to the 20th century. However, for documents preceding the 13th, and especially the 10th century, the same methods led to the quite unexpected discovery of many new statistical duplicates regarded as independent in all respects, and referring to different epochs.
The global chronological diagram showing all statistical duplicates is the second principal empirico-statistical result obtained by the author. The third basic result is the decomposition of the GCD into the sum of four chronicles practically identical to each other, but shifted by considerable time intervals. To give a rough idea, the third statistical result can be formulated in the following way: The modern "textbook" of traditional ancient and medieval chronology and history is the sum, from the statistical point of view, of the four replicas of one shorter "chronicle". The principal part of the book concentrates on these three empirico-statistical results. The subsequent "fibres" are mostly of hypothetical and interpretational character. Roughly speaking, they are required so that we may answer the question: What do the obtained empirico-statistical results mean?
The fifth fibre. It can be called interpretational. Here, we offer different hypotheses which can explain the regularities discovered and the reasons for the duplicate appearance. We do not regard this material as final. The "shorter" textbook I suggested certainly does not claim completeness and can only be regarded as a possible version. Interpretations of the obtained statistical results can be of different nature and will require much work by many specialists in various fields. My attitude toward many of the questions discussed is a result of cooperation and numerous discussions. In particular, the statistical results were reported at the Third, Fourth, and Fifth International Vilnius Conferences

PROBLEMS OF ANCIENT AND
MEDIEVAL CHRONOLOGY
§1. The Global Chronological Diagram of Ancient and Medieval History1
1.1. The moon's elongation and R. Newton's conjecture
Chronology informs us of how much time has passed since a certain historical fact. Meanwhile, the chronological data of a narrative source describing the fact should be reduced to the modern dating units, i.e., be referred to by B .c. or A.D. This problem proves to be quite complicated, since many a historical inference depends on which date we ascribe to the events discussed in the source. Modern global chronology embracing the majority of events of the past is the result of the lengthy work of chronologists who lived from the 15th to the 19th century A.D. Thus, all the major events of ancient and medieval history are associated with certain dates in the Julian calendar, which permits us to study historical processes, evolution of scientific and cultural ideas, technological progress, and so forth, within the scope of large time intervals [1], [2], [4]. However, such research has led to the discovery of certain phenomena which cannot easily be explained for the present. We give an example from natural science, namely, from astronomy. The lunar theory deals, inter alia, with a parameter called the second derivative of the moon's elongation (D"). Depending on time, the values of this parameter should be available for past eras. It can be computed if the ancient eclipse data are known. The problem has been solved by the prominent American astronomer R. Newton [10). The

graph (Fig. 1) he obtained turned out to be extremely surprising. Newton wrote:
"The most striking feature of Fig. 1 is the rapid decline in D" from about A .D. 700 to about A .D. 1300.... This decline means that there was a 'square wave' in the osculating value of D". . . . Such changes in D", and such values, are unexplainable by present geophysical theories . ... " ([10}, p. 114)
To explain this square wave (one-order jump), Newton was forced to suggest that there should exist some nongravitational interactions in the earth-moon system (11]. These enigmatic forces do not manifest themselves in any other way, which is in itself quite unusual. Below, we shall see that there is at least one more explanation of the jump in D".
1.2. The Dark Ages and the Renaissance epochs
Let us return to chronology. In the history of Europe and the Mediterranean, there are several Renaissance epochs during which many achievements of ancient scientific thought, lost in the period of the Dark Ages, were discovered. The epoch in the history of Europe when many scientific facts and cultural habits of the past were rediscovered (from the 13th to the 16th century) has been studied most extensively. Such duplication is explicitly traced in astronomy, military engineering, architecture, literature, and many other branches of science and art. For example, the famous Greek fire, which had played such an important role in the sea battles of antiquity, and which had then been forgotten for centuries, was rediscovered only in the Middle Ages.



§1 The Global Chronological Diagram 3
Apart from the classical Renaissance, the Carolingian Renaissance (the time of Charlemagne) is also generally known, when many authors imitated the antique paragons, duplicating the literary themes which had been forgotten earlier. Similar phenomena (termed Restoration) are also known in the history of ancient Egypt. The prominent Orientalist B.A. Turaev noted that the culture of the Saite period had reproduced that of the Old Kingdom: 2,000-year-old texts again went into use, tombs were decorated following the ancient ways, titles that had sunk into oblivion were reintroduced, and so forth. As we see, duplicates present themselves as a rather frequent phenomenon in history. Naturally, the question arises as to how they are distributed in time: in a random manner or subject to some covert governing law?
1.3. How to substantiate ancient chronology
To calculate the dates of ancient events is not as simple as it may seem at first glance. The final proof of the correctness of certain dates still remains a problem today. It continues to attract the attention of historians and the specialists of physical and chemical dating methods. It is but natural: The further we move from an ancient event in time, the harder it is to date it. The contradictions that often arise in doing so have caused some historians to express doubts regarding the dating of certain events, as suggested by the first chronologists of the 16th to the 18th century, which, by the way, are still accepted with few exceptions at present [12], [13]. A new scientific discipline was born, namely, hypercriticism, which denied not only the correctness of dating a particular event, but also the trustworthiness of certain ancient events. The famous representative of this school, who specialized in the history of ancient Rome, T. Mommsen, noted, in particular, that different versions of dating the foundation of Rome diverged to the extent of 500 years, and that this oscillation influenced the dating of all the documentation counting years since the "foundation of Rome" ((14]; (14*], pp. 513-514). Chronological problems interested the Egyptologists, too. Thus, H. Brugsch stressed the enormous difference in the determination of the date when Menes had been placed on the throne, writing that the difference between the extreme conclusions was striking, it being equal to 2,079 years. In spite of all the discoveries in this branch of Egyptology, the numerical data were (at the end of the 19th century) still in a very unsatisfactory state ([16]; [16*], pp. 95-97). Another example: The chronology of certain events in Egyptian history, which was given by Herodotus in his famous Histories, differs by more than a millennium from that accepted today. Herodotus' chronology is much shorter than the modern version; sometimes, he even places near each other (see [171) rulers who according to the modern version are separated by 18 centuries ((17*], pp. 512, 513, 516). But especially many discrepancies show up if one compares the dates given in medieval texts with the dating ascribed to them today. The distinguished



4 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
modern chronologist E. Bickerman even speaks of "the chaos of medieval datings" ([4], p. 78). Chronology in its present form was created in a series of fundamental works by the founders of modern chronology as a science, J. Scaliger (1540-1609) and D. Petavius (1583-1652). It became a precise science later; however, the work is not yet completed, and, as Bickerman notes, there is no sufficiently complete investigation of ancient chronology that would satisfy modern requirements ([4]; [4*), p. 90). It is not surprising that certain sceptical minds have drawn dramatic conclusions from the above-mentioned difficulties. Thus, as early as the 16th century, a professor of Salamanca University, de Arcilla, published two papers in which he stated that the whole of history preceding the 4th century had been falsified (see de Arcilla, Programma Historicae Universalis, Divinae Florae Historicae ). The same conclusion was reached by the historian and archaeologist J. Hardouin (1646-1724), who regarded the entire classical literature as the work of 16th-century monks. Isaac Newton devoted many years to historical and chronological studies. Having thoroughly investigated practically the entire historical and theological literature, he wrote Abreges de la Chronologie [19], asserting that the time scale of the chronology of antiquity was unnaturally extended. Newton made up his own tables in accordance with a new version of chronology which related the biblical texts to the history of the Mediterranean. In his book Newton, V.G. Kuznetsov wrote that Newton had collected
"fantastically large volwnes of historical material. This was the total of forty years of work, toilsome research and enormous erudition. Newton, in fa.et, studied all the basic literature in ancient history and all primary sources ... " ((18), pp. 104-105).
"Certainly, being unable to read cuneiform and hieroglyphic texts and having no archaeological data, which were then unavailable, ... Newton was in error to the extent not only of tens or hundreds of years, but even millennia ... " ({18), pp. 106-107).
As a matter of fact, many of the most important events of Greek history were chronologically moved forwards by Newton by 300 years, and those of Egyptian history by 1,000 and even 1,800 years. And now in this century, in his Historie und Kritik, the German researcher R. Baldauf was proving on the basis\of philological arguments that not only ancient but even early medieval history was a later falsification. An attempt to systematize the considerable critical material and to analyze historical paradoxes and duplicates from the standpoint of natural science was carried out in the work of a scientist with encyclopaedic knowledge, the revolutionary, public figure and honorary academician, N.A. Morozov (1854-1946) [3]. He actually held the opinion of de Arcilla and believed that traditional chronology had been artificially stretched [2]. It should be noted that he apparently came to this idea independently of de Arcilla. Remarkable scientific intuition and strict logical argumentation permitted Morozov to list numerous data in support of such a conjecture. However, his striving to dot all the i's led to poor substantiation of many of his statements; some contained factual



§1 The Global Chronological Diagram 5
errors, and the new chronological version as a whole (including the hypothesis regarding the falsification of ancient history) was rejected, which does not at all lessen his achievements, for the problem is so complicated and many-sided that one mind alone, even if outstanding, is unable to solve it completely.
1.4. Statistical dating methods: new possibilities
To overcome the above difficulties, we should try to consider the subject from a different angle and create a certain independent dating method which is not based on subjective estimation. This done, we can start analyzing the whole of chronology. In my opinion, an approach involving the statistical analysis of various numerical characteristics associated with ancient texts is most suitable for this purpose. The interested reader can learn about concrete methods and some of their applications to the analysis of global chronology from the short bibliography at the end of the section. Here, we shall confine ourselves to a short account of the essentials and give several examples. We make the immediate reservation that the methods suggested by the author do not pretend to be universal. Moreover, the results obtained by each individual method cannot be regarded as impeccably trustworthy. A sound criterion of their validity is the consistency of the dating obtained by different methods (today, there are seven of them). The general scheme is as follows. First, a statistical hypothesis is formulated for modelling some process (e.g., loss of information with time). Then numerical coefficients are introduced which permit us to quantitatively measure the deviations of experimental curves from those predicted theoretically. Further, the model is checked against a priori true historical material, and if it is confirmed, then the method can be used for the dating of events. For simplicity, we give an example. Let a period in the history of a region P from a year M to a year N be described in a text X (chronicle or annals) broken into separate chapters X(T), each of which is devoted to the events of a year T. We calculate the volume of all the chapters (number of pages or lines) and represent the obtained data as a volume graph, plotting the years, T, on the horizontal, and the volumes of the chapters on the vertical axis. A similar graph for another text, Y, describing the same events, in general will have different form; most probably, the interests or tendencies of the chronologist will have bearing on it. But how essential are these differences? Is there anything common between th~ volume graphs? Indeed, there is. But, before stating the details, some words about the information-loss pattern.
The essential characteristic of any graph is its peaks, or extremal points. In our volume graph, they correspond to the years in which the curve attains local maxima. Such peaks indicate the years described by the chronicle in the time interval under investigation with the finest points of detail. Denote by C(T) the volume of all texts created by contemporary writers and describing a year T. We call it the "primary stock" (Fig. 2a). The precise form of its graph is not known to us, since texts get partly lost in the course of time.

We now formulate the information-loss model, namely, there will be more texts for those years to which more texts were originally devoted. It goes without saying that to verify the model in this form is difficult, because the graph of the primary stock remains unknown. But one of the corollaries can



The Global Chronological Diagram 7
be verified. Later authors, X and Y, while describing the same period (and not being its contemporaries), will be forced to employ approximately the same set of ancient texts available. Therefore, they will be able to describe best those years from which more texts remain. Eventually, the model conjecture is formulated as follows: The graphs of the volumes of chapters for two dependent texts X and Y (i.e., describing the same period of history and the same region) must have simultaneous peaks; in other words, the years described in detail in X and Y should coincide or be close (Fig. 2b). On the other hand, if two texts X and Y are independent (either describing essentially different periods of history of the same length, or for different regions), then the graphs of t.'ie volume for X and Y attain local maxima at different points (Fig. 2c).
After the mathematical formalization, an experiment was carried out in which the model (maximum coTTelation principle) was verified for several hundreds of pairs of dependent and independent historical sources. The principle was confirmed, which made it possible to offer a method for dating texts and also for discovering interdependency among them. For example, to date events described in a chronicle, we have to try to choose an a priori dated text such that the volume graphs attain maxima practically simultaneously. If, however, the dating of two comparable texts is unknown, but the peaks in the graphs coincide, then we can assume with a high degree of probability that the texts are dependent, i.e., the events described are close or coincide. Now, just a few words about some other methods of dating. They are based on the statistical analysis of such parameters as the frequency of mentioning the names of historical characters and that of various astronomical phenomena, the period of the rule of kings in various dynasties, formalized biographical data of historical figures, and so on. All these methods have been verified for undoubtedly true material of the 13th to the 20th century, and their validity has been confirmed [5], [6], [7].
1.5. The duplication effect in ancient history and chronology
The methods briefly described above are applicable not only to the dating of texts. They also permit us to find various literary borrowings, repetitions, literary cliches, citations, and parallels in the texts being compared. For example, if in comparing two dynasties of kings a certain dependence is discovered {i.e., if the corresponding graphs of the rule duration are extremely close), then this can be interpreted in different ways. One interpretation consists of our probably having discovered an intentional imitation by the annalist of a certain authoritative source. However, another version is also probable, namely, that we are dealing with duplicates which were never recognized to be identical and are narrating the same events, and which were related to different historical epochs. Sometimes these methods help discover the proximity of chronicles, i.e., their having originated from the same source. In particular, they make it



8 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
possible to indicate the duplication effects discussed at the beginning of the section in connection with the Renaissance epochs. As it turns out, there are essentially more such historical epochs than is usually thought. To avoid a terminological muddle, we will speak in the following simply of duplicates. It is now time to formulate our problem: to find possibly all duplicates in ancient and medieval history, and if we succeed, to construct on their basis a hypothetical chronology without repetitions and Renaissance periods which are sometimes hard to explain.
1.6. The global chronological diagram and the "modern textbook" of ancient and medieval history
Before coming to the thorough analysis of historical texts for the purpose of discovering and systematizing duplicates, we have to construct as complete a table of events of the ancient and medieval history of Europe as possible and also that of the Mediterranean region, Egypt, and certainly the Near East, showing their traditional dating. To this end, the author has investigated 15 basic chronological tables and 228 fundamental primary sources (chronicles, annals, records, etc.). Together, these texts contain the description of practically all the basic events of the period from 4000 B.C. to A.D. 1800. All this information was then represented graphically on the plane. Each historical epoch with all of its basic events was shown on the time axis. Meanwhile, each event was represented by a point or horizontal line-segment in accordance with its duration, with the beginning and end of the line-segment being those of the event (e.g., a king's rule). Simultaneous events were represented one above the other, so that any ambiguity or overlapping would be avoided. Thus, a maximally complete chart was constructed. We will call it the global chronological diagram (GCD); see Fig. 3, upper line. To see which events took place in a particular year according to modern chronology, we have to draw a vertical line through that year on the GCD and collect all the events being intersected. We have applied the above dating and duplicate-recognition methods to the enormous historical data recorded on the GCD. The entire period of history on the diagram was broken into epochs, for which, roughly speaking, a set of characteristic graphs was calculated. For example, for each epoch (a linesegment on the time axis) in the history of each region, the volume graphs for all the basic primary sources describing this epoch were plotted, and those for different epochs were compared pairwise. As a result of the extensive experiment in which hundreds of texts were investigated, containing altogether tens of thousands of names and hundreds of thousands of lines, the author unexpectedly discovered pairs of epochs which are regarded as independent in traditional history (in every sense), but with extraordinarily close and sometimes even practically indistinguishable graphs.

We illustrate this with an example. The volume graph of the primary sources describing the history of ancient Rome from 753 to 236 B.C. exhibits peaks practically in the same years as a similar graph constructed for medieval Rome from A.D. 300 to 816. To verify this fact, these two time intervals of 500 years in length should be superimposed first (Fig. 4). The same coincidence of the two seemingly independent series of events (antique and medieval) was also discovered by other methods. The GCD happened to include quite a number of duplicates, i.e., pairs of historical epochs which are as close as are undoubtedly dependent texts describing the same historical period. We once again emphasize that the results obtained by different methods are invariably consistent.

1.7. The "modern textbook", a composition of four identical pieces
Let us once more carefully consider the upper line in Fig. 3. To represent the set of all the discovered epochs of duplicates clearly, they are marked on the GCD by the same geometric symbols and letters (chosen arbitrarily). More precisely, duplicates are designated by the same letters, and the epochs that are considerably different from one another by different ones. Some of the letters repeat continually (e.g., T repeats eleven times, and C four times). The length of the geometric figures indicates the duration of the corresponding epoch. Say, the black triangles T are associated with periods that are about 20-30 years long, and the rectangles C with periods approximately 300 years long. Certain intervals of time on the GCD are covered by several figures. Thus, the period from ea. A.D. 300 to 550 is represented by four superimposed rectangles Il, [(, C, P, which means that part of the chart devoted to this period is composed of four pieces designated by different letters. In other words, in the set of events which occurred in the interval from A.D. 300 to 550, those making up the piece II are first distinguished, then those composing K, and so forth. The events falling into a particular piece are most often associated by what happened in the region. By the way, all the Renaissance epochs noted by the historians are contained in the duplicates on the GCD. But the main thing is that a rather complicated structure of the GCD is naturally obtained as the result of one quite surprising process. If the four
lines (chronicles) C1, C2, C3 , C4 (also shown in Fig. 3) are distinguished in the chart and are glued together along the vertical line by superimposing, then we shall obtain, as can be expected, the same line on the GCD, consisting of



§1 The Global Chronological Diagram 11
the lettered epochs. But the most surprising fact is that these four chronicles are represented by practically the same series of letters and symbols. The four duplicate pieces differ from one another only by their position on the time axis. Thus, the second chronicle differs from the first one only by a backward shift in time of about 333 years, the third by a shift of already 1,053 years, and the fourth by an approximately 1,778-year-long shift. Admitting a certain liberty, we can say that the "modern textbook" of the ancient and medieval history of Europe, the Mediterranean region, Egypt, and the Near East is a composite chronicle obtained by gluing together four practically identical replicas of the abridged chronicle C1 . Three other chronicles are derived from it by redating and renaming the events described, while the whole of C1 is lowered (i.e., shifted back in time) by about 333, 1,053, and 1,778 years, respectively. Thus, the entire GCD can be restored from its part C1 . Another fact to be emphasized is that nearly all the information in the chronicle C1 is concentrated to the right of A.O. 960. The periods P, T, C (to the right of the 10th century A.O.) are very rich in information, whereas K, H, Il (from A .o. 300 to 960) contain very few events.
1.8. Certain corollaries and interpretations
This formal decomposition of the "history textbook" into the sum of four chronicles can be interpreted differently. First, that the periodic behaviour I discovered is possibly accidental. It can be calculated, however, that the probability of such a random event is extremely small. Another possible interpretation is that insufficient written evidence casting light on certain periods of ancient history encumbers the application of statistical methods. Finally, a third possible explanation, which seems to me worth notice, is that the existing global chronology of the period preceding the 13th century A .o. requires quite substantial corrections in certain cases. These will require the redating of certain blocks of events now related to earliest antiquity, for which the chronicles C4, C3, C2 of the modern chronological chart should be distinguished and lifted upwards in accordance with the mentioned shifts. After this formal procedure, the known written history of Europe, the Mediterranean, and so forth, will be abridged, and most of the events now dated as having occurred earlier than the 10th century A.D. will be placed in the interval from the 10th to the 17th century A.O. This hypothesis can help explain certain long-known paradoxes of traditional chronology, including those mentioned at the beginning of the section. However, I do not at all agree with the assumption of N.A. Morozov and some of his predecessors that the information today available regarding ancient history is, allegedly, a later falsification. The results obtained by new methods of dating show that most of the primary sources which have been prescribed are originals describing real events. Almost all the events mentioned in ancient documents did occur; the question remains only where and when.



12 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
Generally speaking, the principal result of the work done is of formal statistical character, and no more. Nonspecialists in history have already attempted to interpret this result in a pseudoscientific manner, with the data of social science being ignored. I am decisively against such conclusions.
1.9. What is to be done with the moon's elongation?
Let us return to the beginning of the chapter, to the moon's elongation and its second derivative. The computation of D" was based on the data of ancient eclipses adopted by traditional chronology. The attempts to explain the surprising square wave in the graph of D" do not touch at all upon the question whether the data of the eclipses were determined correctly. We will assume that an eclipse has been dated correctly if its characteristics exactly described in a historical source coincide with the parameters of the real eclipse offered by chronology. Morozov suggested a method of "impartial" dating, namely, the comparison of the characteristics of an eclipse given in a primary source with those from astronomical tables. Analysis demonstrates that, while not questioning the chronology of ancient events and a priori regarding it as true, the astronomers often could not find a suitable eclipse in the "desired" century and thus resorted to strained interpretations. For example, in the History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides, three eclipses were described, traditionally dated as belonging to the 5th century B.C. However, even in the last century, a discussion around this triad started, being caused by the fact that there were no eclipses with suitable characteristics in the assumed epoch. Still, an exact solution can be found if we extend the interval of the search. One solution is the 12th century A.O., and the second one the 11th century A.O. There are no other solutions.
A similar effect of "shifting the dates forwards" can be extended to those eclipses which are traditionally dated in the interval from A.O. 400 to 900. It is only after A.O. 900 that the traditional dates are satisfactorily consistent with the precise datings given by astronomy, and undoubtedly after A.O. 1300. But why, in fact, speak of it here? Because such a shift of dates is completely consistent with the GCD being glued together from four identical chronicles. If an earlier and traditional date for an eclipse was assigned to an epoch, say, labelled by Con the GCD, then its precise astronomical date lies much farther to the right on the time axis. It occurs in the period of history denoted on the diagram by the same letter. In particular, the date shift just described is reduced to advancing certain groups of eclipses up by about 333 years, others by 1,053 years, and so on. In such a. time advance, the mutual occurrence of dates inside each of these groups is practically unaltered, and the group is advanced as a block. But what's to be done with D"? Its recalculation on the basis of the reconsidered dates of ancient eclipses showed that the graph (Fig. 5) is qualitatively altered. It cannot now be moved reliably to the left earlier than the 10th

No square wave is found in the second derivative, and no mysterious nongravitational theories should be invented.... It goes without saying that the work discussed here cannot claim to be the basis for any final conclusion, the more so as the most complicated, multifarious and often subjectively interpreted historical data are analyzed here by strictly mathematical methods. To process the material will certainly require a large variety of methods, purely historical, archaeological, philological, physical and chemical, and, inter alia, mathematical, which as the reader can see, will permit us to look at the problems of chronology from a new angle.

2.1. Parameter D" and R. Newton's paper "Astronomical evidence concerning non-gravitational forces in the Earth-Moon system"
The present section discusses in more detail my results described in [4] (see the list of references at the end of §3). It is known that, for certain problems of computational astronomy, the behaviour of the so-called second derivative of the moon's elongation D"(t) as a function of time t should have been known
for large time intervals in the past [13]. Let nM be the acceleration of the moon with respect to ephemeris time, and WE that of the earth. The quan
tity D" = nM - 0.033862tiJE, which is the second derivative of the moon's elongation, is called an acceleration parameter [10], [13]. D" is normally measured in arc seconds per century squared. The dependence of the parameter D"(t) on time has been established in a series of remarkable works by the American astronomer R. Newton [9], (10], [13), who calculated 12 values of the parameter D" on the basis of the investigation of 370 observations of ancient and medieval eclipses, extracted from historical sources ((11), p. 113). In computing the date tec1. of the observation of a particular concrete eclipse, the parameter D" can be neglec~ed. Therefore, it can, in turn, be found from the distribution of ancient eclipse dates tec1., which is a priori regarded as known. In R. Newton's papers (9], [10], [11], (13], the computation of D" was based on the dates of ancient eclipses contained in the chronological canons of F. Ginzel and T. Oppolzer (8], (12). They are generally accepted in the contemporary literature. The results of Newton, related to those of Martin, who studied about 2,000 telescopic observations of the moon from 1627 to 1860, allowed him to construct an experimental curve for D"(t) in the interval from 900 B.C. to A.O. 1900. In the following, we will sometimes designate
A.O. by "+", and B.C. by "-". In Fig. 6, the symbol• indicates the values of the parameter D" calculated by means of solar eclipse data, while ◊ denotes those of D" which were computed from the lunar eclipse durations fixed in the documents. The sign A implies the values of D" calculated on the basis of information regarding the duration of solar eclipses. Finally, V indicates the values of D'' computed from the phases of solar eclipses (see (111). Commenting upon the graph of D" obtained, Newton wrote:
"D" has had surprisingly large values and ... it has undergone large and sudden changes within the past 2000 years ... " ((11), pp. 114-115).

Newton's paper "Astronomical evidence concerning non-gravitational forces in the Earth-Moon system" [9] was also devoted to the attempts to explain this strange gap (one-order jump) in the parameter D". Thus, on the basis of Newton's works [9]-[11], we can make the following conclusions. ( 1) In the interval A .D. 400-600, the parameter D" starts falling sharply (one-order jump). (2) Before this interval, until A.O. 300-400, the values of D" do not deviate much from zero. (3) Starting with about A .D. 1000, the values of D" are close to those of today; in particular, they are practically constant. (4) In the interval 6000 B.c. to A.D. 1000, the parameter D" undergoes considerable variance, with the oscillation amplitude reaching up to 6011 /century2 . Hereafter, the bounds of the time intervals indicated are approximate. Newton writes that D" "has even changed its sign near about A.O. 800" ([11), p. 115). In the following, we shall point out two bounds in the behaviour of the graph D", the first of them being about A .D. 500 (the beginning of the square wave on the graph), and the other one about A .D. 1000 (the end of the square wave). In the present section, we give the results of a new interpretation and calculations of the graph of D", based on the dates of astronomical observational data made precise, which form the basis for computing the parameter D". The curve of fY' which we obtained has qualitatively different character. In particular, the incomprehensible one-order gap of the graph completely vanishes. As
it turns out, the new graph of D" is, in reality, oscillating around a constant numerical value which coincides with the modern one. As a corollary, the



§2 The Moon's Elongation and Ancient Eclipses 17
necessity to invent "nongravitational forces" for the explanation of the "gap" in the graph becomes unnecessary.
2.2. Available observations of ancient solar and lunar eclipses
Let X be the set of all available observations of ancient solar and lunar eclipses. Their complete list has been given by F. Ginzel ([8], pp. 167-271). Let A be the set of all eclipses described in the ancient texts X. We have to bear in mind that the same eclipse may be described in several ancient texts. We denote them by Xec1.. Let tec1. be the date ascribed to a particular eclipse in accordance with the traditional chronology. These traditional dates have been fixed in the papers of F. Ginzel and T. Oppolzer [8], [12]. They all form a basis for the computation of D"(t). In computing D"(tec1.) (i.e., at a point fec1. on the time axis t), the theoretical, calculated characteristics of an eclipse, obtained for the date tec1. on the basis of modern lunar theory, are compared with the description of the eclipse, portrayed by the ancient sources Xec1 .. The deviation between these two groups of data is exactly what permits us to find the value of the parameter D" at the moment tec1 .. This value of D" certainly depends on the choice of the eclipse date, and only those ancient texts are important which contain sufficiently much information about it, e.g., the description of the trajectory, phase, and so on. The analysis of all the ancient texts available (see F. Ginzel [8]) permitted us to distinguish a list of sufficiently complete descriptions of eclipses. We do not have the space to give it here. All our computations in the following are related just to these eclipses. Newton's attempts to explain the mysterious square wave of the function D"(t) do not touch upon the problem of the precision and correctness of the dates ascribed to the ancient and medieval eclipses by traditional chronology [8], [12]. In other words, the question as to how well the descriptive parameters of an eclipse, fixed in an ancient text, correspond to the calculated eclipse parameters found for the moment tec1. on the basis of lunar theory, was addressed, with tec1. meaning here the date ascribed by traditional chronology {8], [12]. The dating and the description of a given eclipse can be regarded as correct only in the case where the two groups of characteristics, i.e., calculated and fixed in a historical source, coincide. Note that changing the dates of the eclipses will alter the graph of D". The relation between the problem of calculating the parameter D" and the known investigations of N.A. Morozov (2] was indicated for the first time in the author's paper [4], which, in particular, touched upon the problem of correctly dating ancient eclipses and their descriptions. On the basis of the analysis of considerable factual data, Morozov suggested and partly substantiated his fundamental conjecture that the traditional chronology of the ancient world might be artificially extended in comparison with the real situation. An important role in forming this conjecture was played by the method of astronomical dating.



18 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
The descriptions of eclipses from certain ancient texts started to be employed for dating these sources and related events as early as the 16th century. However, the method was applied only for the purpose of obtaining the dates in a somewhat more precise and, usually, quite narrow, prescribed time interval where traditional chronology placed them and the simultaneous eclipse under investigation.
2.3. A method of formal astronomical dating
In paper (2], a method of formal astronomical dating was suggested, consisting of the extraction of the eclipse's descriptive characteristics from a historical text, and then purely mechanically recording all dates of the eclipses with these characteristics from the modern astronomical tables. The recalculation of the ancient eclipse data was performed just by this method in the indicated work, with the dates traditionally being ascribed to the time interval from 700 B .c. to A.o. 400. For the purpose of computing the parameter D", I carried out a new series. of calculations of the ancient and medieval eclipse dates, thus confirming, in particular, the effect of shifting the dates of ancient eclipses forwards from 700 B.C. to A.O. 400 ([2]; (4]; see below). We now describe the method of formal astronomical dating in more detail. The papers of Ginzel and Oppolzer [8], [12] supply a list of 89 ancient eclipses and indicate the ancient texts which reported them. The latter are usually (traditionally) dated to have occurred in the interval from 700 B.c. to A.O. 592. A list of the eclipses' descriptive characteristics extracted from an ancient text can be complete to varying degrees. For example, the moment of an eclipse during an entire day can be indicated, but not its phase, and so forth. Besides, the canons of Ginzel and Oppolzer contain the complete and theoretically calculated list of eclipses occurring from 900 B.C. to A.O. 1582, with the basic characteristics including the date and phase of an eclipse, the umbra coordinates, and so on. The problem of dating an eclipse described by an ancient text (and, therefore, that of the accompanying events) is solved as follows. We take the eclipses from the canons (8), [12], all of whose calculated characteristics exactly coincide with those in a historical source. At the same time, it is required that (1) there should be no deviation from the description in the document, and (2) the time interval in which the astronomical solution is sought should not be bounded. This means that we do neglect the a priori outside information of "nonastronomical origin". Analysis shows that requirements (I) and (2) are not fulfilled in the classical works [8] and [12] in the overwhelming majority of cases: The date of an eclipse is usually sought there not in the possible whole historical time interval, but only within naJTOw prescribed limits (normally, one century) in which, according to earlier chronological tradition, an approximate date of the event studied (and, therefore, of the eclipse) was pre-established. The application of the method of formal astronomical dating to eclipses



§2 The Moon's Elongation and Ancient Eclipses 19
traditionally dating from 700 B.C. to A.O. 400 [2], [4) shows that the written evidence concerning them can be separated into two classes.
(1) Short and vague evidence (without any details). Here, it is often unclear whether the text describes an eclipse at all. In this class, the astronomical dating of written evidence is either senseless or allows for so many possible astronomical solutions that they all fall into practically any of the prescribed historical epochs. (2) Detailed evidence. In this class, an astronomical solution often turns out to be unambiguous (or there are two or three solutions).
2.4. The effect of shifting the dates of eclipses forwards
One important fact discovered in [2] is that all the eclipses of the second class are not dated by the formal astronomical approach traditionally as, for example, in [8] and [12], by 700 B.C. to A.O. 400, but substantially later. These dates sometimes differ from the traditional ones by several centuries. Meanwhile, these new astronomical solutions (dates) fall into the time interval from A.O. 400 to 1600. The forceful distortion of the dates, made by the earlier chronologists, and fixed in the classical papers [8] and [12], is due to the pressure of chronological tradition. The astronomers had to look for the required astronomical solutions only within a narrow, prescribed time interval. More than that, in most cases, an exact astronomical solution could not be found, and the astronomers had to exhibit an eclipse only partly satisfying the description contained in the ancient document (see the examples below). In making use of the method of formal astronomical dating, this deviation (strained solution) vanishes, which leads to the appearance of new astronomical solutions {dates), although different from the traditional ones. Continuing the investigations started in [2], the author has also analyzed the medieval eclipses from A.O. 400 to 1600 on the basis of formal astronomical dating methods. It turned out that the effect of shifting the eclipse dates forwards, which had been discovered in the above-mentioned paper only for ancient eclipses, could be extended also to the eclipses traditionally dated as belonging to the interval A .o. 400-900. In particular, many pieces of written evidence (due to the extreme vagueness of their formulations) proved to admit a large spectrum of astronomical solutions distributed over the entire possible period of history. It is only beginning with about A.O. 900, and not A.O. 400, as was suggested originally [2), that the traditional eclipse dates become satisfactorily consistent with the results of the application of the formal astronomical dating method. Finally, this consistency becomes reliable only after about A.D. 1300. This result agrees with the theory of empirical corrections employed in ([8], pp. 4-6), to revise the formulas for the calculation of eclipse dates. Thus, as 21 "basic eclipses" receiving detailed descriptions in at least 10 ancient texts, we can take those dated to the right of (later than) A.D. 840 (42 reports) and distributed in the interval up to A .o. 1386 (8). On the other hand, we



20 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
recall that it is since A.D. 1300 ([12], p. 114) that the graph of parameter D" has finally been stabilized and aligned. Thus, this moment of the graph's stabilization coincides with the origin of the interval of reliable consistency of the dates of ancient eclipses and with the results of the application of the formal astronomical dating method. An extremely small number of the dates of eclipses in the time interval from A.D. 400 to 900 we discovered and which do not contradict the formal astronomical dating method, is of little importance statistically. At any rate, this is true from the standpoint of the new computation of the graph of D". Before stating the results of the new computations of the graph of D", we shall dwell at length on the effect of shifting the dates of ancient eclipses in the Middle Ages. Above, we have indicated the difficulties facing the astronomers in dating many of the eclipses traditionally. They were caused by the requirement of traditional chronology to place the dates of eclipses in a narrow, prescribed time interval. The formal astronomical dating method removes these obstacles. Because of considerable factual material, we give here only a short summary, the final results, and typical examples.
2.5. An example: three eclipses of Thucydides
Example 1. Consider the three famous eclipses of Thucydides (the so-called triad; see [8], pp. 176-179, eclipses 6, 8, 9). They are linked into one triad by their having been described in one historical text, namely the History of the Peloponnesian War (Bks. II, 27-28; IV, 51-52; VII, 18-19, 50). The descriptive characteristics of the triad, which are extracted from Thucydides' text unambiguously, are of the following form. (1) All three eclipses were observed in the Mediterranean region, namely, in a square approximately bounded by the longitudes 15° E. and 30° E. and the latitudes 30° N. and 42° N. (2) The first eclipse was solar. (3) The second eclipse was solar. (4) The third eclipse was lunar. (5) The time interval between the first and second eclipses was 7 years. (6) The time interval between the second and third eclipses was 11 years. (7) The first eclipse occurred in summer. (8) The first (solar) eclipse was total (since "the stars were visible,,), i.e., its phase et> is 12". (9) The first eclipse occurred in the afternoon (local time). (10) The second (solar) eclipse occurred at the beginning of summer. (11) The third (lunar) eclipse occurred at the end of summer. (12) The second eclipse occurred approximately in March. Condition 12 is not clearly determined from Thucydides' text and, therefore, is not included in the final list of conditions. The problem arises to find a triad of eclipses completely satisfying all conditions 1-11. Work [8] gives the traditional astronomical solution, namely, 431, 424, and 413 B.C. However, as has been known long ago, it does not satisfy



§2 The Moon's Elongation and Ancient Eclipses 21
all the data of the problem. As a matter of fact, the eclipse of 431 B.c. was not total as required by condition 8. It was only annular with phase 10" for the observation zone and could not be observed as total anywhere on the earth's surface ([8], pp. 176-177). This important circumstance was noted by many authors, e.g., J. Zech, E. Heis, N. Struyck, G. Riccioli, F. Ginzel, and I. Hoffman [8]. A considerable number of astronomical papers were devoted to the recalculation of the phase cl> of the eclipse of 431 B.c., for which various admissible corrections were introduced into the equations of the lunar theory in order to make the phase close to 12". Thus, Dionysius Petavius obtained
cl>= 10"25 for the observation zone, Struyck 11" ([8], p. 176), Zech 10"38 [14], Hoffman 10"72 ([8], p. 176), and Heis even 7"9(!) ([8], p. 176). In the modern literature, the phase value is assumed to be 10" [8]. We stress once again that, due to its annular form, the first eclipse in 431 B.C. was total nowhere on earth for any latitude and longitude. Accordingly, Ginzel wrote2 :
"The insignificance of the eclipse phase was somewhat shocking. . . . According to the new calculations, the phase was equal to 1011 • ••• " (8).
Besides, certain other conditions were not fulfilled either. For example, the umbra passed through the observation zone only after 17 hours local time, and even after 18 hours according to Heis (8], which means that condition 9 (the eclipse occurring in the afternoon) is satisfied only approximately. Certain authors ([8]; see the survey) carried out the calculation of the coordinates of bright planets, thinking that they could have been seen during the annular eclipse, in order to satisfy the important condition 8. However, the obtained results showed clearly that the planets' positions on the celestial sphere during the eclipse of 431 B .c. did not provide for their reliable visibility. If Venus could have been visible, then, for example, Mars was only 3° over the horizon (Heis's computation), while Jupiter and Saturn were below the horizon, and so forth ([8], p. 177). Johnson suggested another astronomical solution for Thucydides' first eclipse, namely, 433 B.C. Although it soon became clear that this solution still did not satisfy the data of the problem posed, it was now for other reasons [8]. Besides, this eclipse had a short phase, namely, 7"8 [8]. The largest variation possible of certain constants in the lunar equations, with the purpose to increase the phase of the eclipse in 431 B.C., was made by Stockwell. However, it yielded only 11"06 for the observation zone, which did not account for the completeness of the eclipse either. The computations were questioned in the literature, too (8]. In this connection, an attempt to revise Thucydides' text itself, and, in particular, condition 8, should be noted also. However, its detailed analysis carried out at the author's request by E.V. Alexeeva (Faculty of Philology, Moscow University) showed that the eclipse characteristics were unambiguously determined from Thucydides. This circumstance had not been questioned earlier, though.

22 Problems of Ancient an-d Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
No other astronomical solutions in 600-200 B.C., which would be more suitable than the traditional solution of 431, 424, 413 B .c., seem to have been found. It is because of this fact that this incorrect "solution" has been retained in spite of the above contradiction repeatedly discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, the application of the formal astronomical dating method and the extension of the search interval (for astronomical solutions) to 900 B .c.A.D. 1600 yield two and only two exact solutions, the first having been given in paper [2] (Vol. 4, pp. 509, 493-512), while the second one was given by the author of the present work during the repeated analysis of all the eclipses from the indicated interval and the construction of their trajectories on the diagram. Thus the first solution yields August 2, 1133, March 20, 1140, and August 28, 1151, whereas the second is August 22, 1039, April 9, 1046, and September 15, 1057. Note that the fact of the availability of exact solutions itself is nontrivial. In both exact solutions found, even condition 12 is fulfilled, the one not originally included in the list of basic data. Besides, the first eclipse is total in both solutions (for the observation zone), which is just what was required by condition 8.
2.6. An example: the eclipse described by Livy
Example 2. Consider eclipse 25 (see [8], pp. 189-190) described in the History of Rome by Livy (Bk. XXXVII, 4.4). The characteristics extracted from Livy's text are as follows. (1) The eclipse was solar. (2) It occurred 5 days earlier than the ides of July, i.e., on July 10.
(3) The approximate coordinates of its observation zone were 30° < lat. N.
< 45° and 10° < long. E. < 25°. (4) In the observation zone, the moon's trajectory passed below the centre of the sun during the eclipse if the moon and sun were projected on the celestial sphere. The traditional solution suggested in Ginzel's canon [8] was March 14, 190 B.C. However, since condition 2 was not fulfilled, the astronomers also offered other astronomical solutions, e.g., July 17, 188 B.c. But the conditions of the problem posed were not satisfied in this case either ([8], p. 190). Owing to the absence of other astronomical solutions for the time interval 300-100 B.c., determined beforehand due to the a priori requirements of tradition, and which would satisfy conditions 1-4 better, the traditional one of 190 B.C. was retained in the canon. Meanwhile, the application of the formal astronomical dating method and extension of the interval in which an exact solution was being SQught to the periods from 600 B.c. to A.O. 1600 permits us to reach the following conclusion [2]. (1) As it turns out, there is an eclipse fully satisfying all the conditions of the problem.



§2 The Moon's Elongation and Ancient Eclipses 23
(2) This exact solution is unique for the interval from 600 B.C. to A.O. 1600. (3) It is July 10, A.O. 967. (4) It is stable with respect to a small perturbation of the initial data, namely a perturbation of the principal condition 2, which means that it remains unique in extending the search interval from July 10 to July 9 and 11, i.e., by one day. This exact solution was found in [2], assuming, naturally, that the Julian names of the months correspond to the Julian calendar.
2.7. An example: the eclipse described by Livy and Plutarch
Example 3. Consider the list of descriptive characteristics of eclipse 27 (see [8], p. 190) also described in Livy's History of Rome, Bk. LIV, 36.1. See also Plutarch's Vitae Aemilius Paulus, 17. ( 1) The eclipse was lunar. (2) It occurred on the night of September 4 to September 5. (3) The observation zone was bounded by lat. 40° and 50° N, and long. 10° and 25° E. (4) It occurred from 2 to 4 A.M. local time. (5) Its phase was close to 12", and possibly exceeded 12".
Remark. The phase of a solar eclipse is found by the formula cl> = 12..\, where .,\ is the ratio of the part of the sun's diameter, covered by the moon at the eclipse's maximum, to the whole diameter. However, in the case of a supertotal lunar eclipse, a quantity proportional to its duration is added to the phase of 12" (the moon stays in the shadow of the earth for a long time). Hence, the phase of a lunar eclipse can reach 22"7. (6) This lunar eclipse occurred after the summer solstice. The traditional solution given in the canon ([8], p. 190) is June 21, 168 B.C. This does not satisfy conditions 2 and 6 of our problem. Attempts of many authors to find a better astronomical solution for the interval from 300 to 100 B.C., determined a priori from the requirements of tradition, did not lead to positive results. Omitting the details, we should note that the situation is perfectly similar to the one described in Examples 1 and 2. Application of the formal astronomical dating method and extension of the search time interval from 600 B.C. to A.O. 1600 permit us to draw the following conclusions [2). (1) There exist exact astronomical solutions fully satisfying all conditions 1-6. (2) There are only three exact solutions for the time interval from 600 B.C. to A.O. 1600. (3) These solutions are (a) the night of September 4 to September 5, A.O. 415, (b) the night of September 4 to September 5, A.O. 955, and (c) the night of September 4 to September 5, A.O 1020 ((2], Vol. 5, pp. 266-272). (4) For a small perturbation of the initial data, i.e., while considering lunar eclipses occurring not only at night but also at sunset, there arises only one more possible solution, (d) the night of September 4 to Septemer 5, A .o. 434.



24 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
Yet another solution is theoretically possible, namely, the lunar eclipse of September 4 to September 5, 106 B.c.; however, it possesses the phase 5"9, which is far too small. If we select those with greatest phases from the above astronomical solutions (see condition 5 of the problem), then two of them are ideally suitable, namely the eclipse of A.D. 955 with the phase of 16"1 and that of A.D. 1020 with the phase of 18"7, the latter being still more adequate than the former. Upon further perturbation of the initial data of the problem, namely, also considering the night of September 3 to September 4, four other new astronomical solutions present themselves; however, they all relate to the medieval period, occurring in A.O. 453, 936, 1457, and 1476. A perturbation of the initial data in the other direction, namely, considering the night of September 5 to September 6, is impossible, which follows from Livy's text.
2.8. An example: the evangelical eclipse described in the New Testament in connection with the Crucifixion
Example ,I. Let us consider the characteristics of lunar eclipse 36 (see [8], pp. 200-201) described in the New Testament, i.e., the so-called evangelical eclipse (Mt 27:45, Mk 15:33, Lk 23:44-45). (1) The eclipse was Iunar. (2) It was related to the spring equinox or occurred on the eve of Passover (Jn 19:14, 19:30-34). For the present, we do not distinguish between Easter and Passover. (3) It occurred on Friday during Passover (Jn 19:14, Mt 27:62). (4) It lasted for about three hours (Mk 15:33-34). (5) It lasted from 0 A.M. to 3 A.M. according to the modern count of hours. This condition is sometimes questioned in the chronological literature; however, there are valid reasons to believe that the eclipse started approximately at midnight (see [2]). The traditional solution given in [8] is April 3, A.O. 33 (the date of the crucifixion). However, just like in the above examples, this solution does not satisfy the data of our problem. Namely, although conditions 1, 2, and 3 are fulfilled (the eclipse occurs on the eve of Passover), conditions 4 and 5 are not. In particular, the phase of this eclipse (for the observation zone, i.e., Jerusalem) is so small that it could have been observed only for several minutes as the umbra was already sliding off the rim of the lunar disc. In spite of the quite controversial descriptive characteristics of this lunar eclipse and the conjecture of some medieval authors and annalists, such as Synkellos, Phlegon, Africanus, and Eusebius, that it had in reality been solar (Lk 23:45), we can, nevertheless, endeavor to apply the formal astronomical dating method. We obtain (see (2]) that the above problem does have at least one solution. (1) In the time interval from 200 B.C. to A.O. 800, there really exists a lunar eclipse satisfying conditions 1-5.



§2 The Moon's Elongation and Ancient Eclipses 25
(2) In the time interval from 200 B.C. to A.O. 800, this astronomical solution
..
1s umque. (3) The solution is March 21, A.O. 368. The (supertotal) eclipse phase is large and equals 13"3. It should be noted that the calculations with the purpose of discovering a suitable lunar eclipse were made in the interval only up to A.O. 800 [2]. As a matter of fact, Morozov believed that the related historical events (the crucifixion) could not have occurred later than A.O. 800 ([2], Vol. 1, p. 97). Without imposing this restriction a priori, we extended the calculations along the time axis to embrace the whole interval up to A.O. 1600. The author has therefore found only one more possible astronomical solution of the problem: the eclipse of April 3, A.D. 1075. There are no other solutions. The eclipse of A .o. 1075 did occur on Friday on the eve of Passover, which
was on April 5, 1075. However, its phase was small, ~ = 4"8. The moment when half of the period of the eclipse elapsed was at 23 hours and 18 minutes GMT, which means, in particular, that, in the latitude of Rome, for example, it occurred at about midnight. The coordinates of the zenith were lat. 10° N and long. 8° W. Its date (April 3) coincides with the canonical one of the evangelical eclipse (see, e.g., [8], p. 200). The date April 3 is regarded as canonical and traditional. Besides, the lunar eclipse of A.O. 1075 occurred precisely on the eve of Passover, which is consistent with the requirements of the tradition that assumes that the crucifixion occurred on the eve of Passover. Recall that the traditional astronomical solution of April 3, A.O. 33, is also two days prior to Passover, which occurred on April 5, A.O. 33.
2.9. The oscillation of a new graph of D" about one and the same value. No nongravitational theories are necessary
We now list certain results. If t~:i': denotes the date of an eclipse obtained
by the formal astronomical dating method, and t~~1. is the traditional date
given, e.g., in the canons of Ginzel and Oppolzer [8], [12], then we obtain the following result. As it turns out, for all the eclipses of the second class (i.e., those thoroughly described in ancient texts), the following important inequality is valid, namely,
told tnew
eel. > ed. •
Moreover, this shifting of the dates of ancient eclipses of the second class forwards in time (see above) is carried out in the following uniform manner. All eclipses of the second class traditionally dated in the interval from 900 B.C. to A.O. 400, turn out to be mechanically shifted further ahead than A .o. 400 into the Middle Ages. It happens that the percentage of eclipses of the first class (inaccurately and vaguely described in the sources) is extremely high from A.O. 400 to 900. The dates of such eclipses are either almost incalculable by astronomical means due to the imprecision of written evidence about them
or are shifted forwards again. Starting with A.D. 900, the new dates t~~l are
satisfactorily consistent with t~~1.. Only beginning with A .o. 1300 does this



26 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
correlation get quite reliable. The complete picture of shifting the dates of ancient eclipses forwards on the time axis turns out to be rather confusing and complicated because of the nonuniqueness of astronomical solutions. Nevertheless, it obeys a certain law which we shall describe below. Recall that the behaviour of the graph of D"(t), computed by R. Newton
on the basis of the prior eclipse dates t~~1., also makes it possible to naturally distinguish certain time intervals characterized by a.n essentially different behaviour of the parameter D" on the time axis. Remember that the values of D" oscillate about zero (though very few of them have been computed) earlier than A.O. 400. Then, in the time interval A.O. 400-1000, a considerable chaotic variance of the parameter values is noticeable. Finally, since A.O. 1000 (and still more since A.O. 1300), the values of D" are already close to those known today. Thus, we obtain one important conclusion. It turns out that the time limits discovered for the behaviour of D''(t) almost coincide with the characterization of different shifts of the dates of ancient eclipses forwards on the time axis. This indicates a p~sible relation between the two important effects, namely, (1) the square wave in the behaviour of D" and (2) the shift of the dates of ancient eclipses forwards due to the application of the formal astronomical dating method. Let us ascribe to each ancient eclipse from historical sources its new date
t~it calculated by the formal astronomical dating method. The recalculation of the values of parameter D" on the basis of these new dates, which I carried out in (4), is shown in Fig. 7.

Figure 7. New curve for D"(t) an the interval from 900 B.C. to A.D. 1900 (A. T. Fomenko).
We see that the replacement of the date t~~t_ by t~:r' not only shifts the historical events and texts describing the eclipses forwards in time, but also, in most cases, leads to the identification of "former eclipses" (previously



§2 The Moon's Elongation and Ancient Eclipses 27
regarded as ancient) with medieval ones known from other sources. Moreover, the "ancient eclipses" overlap with the medieval ones, many of which were used by R. Newton for the computation of the former graph of D" for the period from A.O. 400 to 1900, thus adding new texts previously treated as antique and traditionally dated as older to the formerly medieval one, with information about medieval eclipses being used to determine the "medieval part" of the graph of D". Therefore, we now have to take into account these new additional data (characteristics of eclipses) which earlier were ascribed to other, presumably ancient eclipses in recalculating the medieval part of the graph of D". A priori, such an extension of the list of descriptive characteristics of certain medieval eclipses could have led to a contradiction with their characteristics known earlier from medieval texts, and, in particular, to a change of the formerly medieval values of D"(t) from A.O. 400 to 1900. However, the detailed investigation of all descriptive characteristics, both old and new, has shown that the formerly medieval values of D" from A .o. 400 to 1900 are almost unaltered. Based on this result, we can make the following conclusions: The new curve
of D" from A.O. 400 to 1900 practically coincides with the former. From 900
B.C. to A.O. 400, the new curve of D" is simply undetermined, since no reliable
eclipse dates t~;t exist for this time period.
The new graph of D" is qualitatively different from the former. We see that
D" varies along a smooth and nearly constant curve (horizontal in Fig. 7) which oscillates about one and the same value -18" /century2 from A.O. 900
to 1900. The parameter D" undergoes no sharp change. It invariably retains approximately the modern value. No nongravitational theories of the type suggested in [9] are therefore necessary. It is interesting that the variance of the
values of D", quite insignificant from A.O. 900 to 1900, gradually increases in shifting to the left from A.O. 900 to A.O. 400. In our opinion, this fact indicates the vagueness and insufficiency of the observational data contained in ancient historical texts describing this period. Then (see Fig. 7), to the left of A .o. 400, the zone starts where reliable observational data (which may have survived to the present day) are absent, which reflects the natural distribution in time of astronomical observational data supplied by tlie ancient chroniclers. Apparently, the exactness of observational data and textual descriptions from A .o. 400 to 1000 was extremely low. The precision of observations and descriptions started to improve afterwards as the technology and the instruments improved and became more sophisticated, which is reflected by the gradual decrease in
the variance of the values of D". Finally, in the era of developed astronomy,
we see that the curve of D" is all but aligned, and stable from A.O. 900 to 1900. All the previous results show that the dates of ancient eclipses are shifted forwards in their redating, with the magnitude of the shifts being expressed
by the positive quantities t~:r - t~f..



28 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
2.10. Three rigid "astronomical shifts" of ancient eclipses
We see that, for different eclipse groups previously regarded as ancient, the values of the shifts forwards are much different, which leads to a great confusion in the general picture of redating ancient eclipses. Nevertheless, it so happens that the system of redating and shifting the dates forwards in time, which appears rather chaotic at first glance, allows the derivation of an important regularity, discovered by the author. This law completely agrees with the system of the three rigid chronological shifts in ancient history, discovered by the author in [5] on the basis of quite different statistical investigations (of nonastronomical character), which we shall not define here due to lack of space. However, we formulate only the final result, while referring the reader to the aforementioned work. Consider the historical time interval from 1600 B.C. to A.O. 1700. Cover it with a system of line-segments denoted arbitrarily by the letters K, H, II, C, T. Placed on the time axis, they are of different length, and the same letter, or interval, can be repeated several times. Moreover, different intervals designated differently can overlap one another, in which case we will denote the letters of the overlapping intervals by "fractions". In Fig. 8, they are represented for better visualization by different geometrical symbols such as rectangles, triangles, and trapezia. The covering of the obtained time axis will be referred to as the global chronological diagram (GCD). It has the following form:
GCD=T K T H T T K T H T K T T K T H T T PT C
--
p C p nn C

Cp
p
We will also indicate the end-(boundary-)points of all these intervals, for which we rewrite the chronicle line in the GCD, marking the dates of the beginning and end of each epoch interval. For example, the symbol 1570 T 1550 means that the given copy of the epoch interval T starts in 1570 B.C. and ends in 1550 B.C. If the left-hand number is greater than the right-hand one, then we mean the years B.c.; otherwise, the years A.O. are meant. Thus, we have:

The identical letters indicate the epoch duplicates. For example, the epoch 500 C 250 duplicates 950 C 1300. The GCD resolves into the composition of the three rigid shifts shown in Fig. 9(1). By adding the horizontal lines vertically (i.e., by superimposing them) and by identifying the same letters placed over each other in the same column, we obviously obtain the complete
GCD. Thus, we can write symbolically that the GCD = C1 + C2 +Ca+ C4 , where the chronicle line C1 equals Co+C'. All four chronicle lines C1, C2, Ca, and C4 are almost indistinguishable, i.e., they consist of the same sequences of letters. The chronicle C2 is meanwhile glued to C1 with a backward shift of
about 333 years, Cs to C1 + C2 with a backward shift of approximately 1,053
years, and C,i to C1 + C2 + Ca with a backward shift about 1,778 years in length. All three basic rigid shifts are counted from one and the same point (Fig. 7). We obtain that the three chronological shifts discovered on the basis of statistical methods of nonastronomical character (see the author's paper [5])



§2 The Moon's Elongation and Ancient Eclipses 31
manifest themselves also in a rather complicated picture of a forward shift of the revised ancient eclipse dates. It should be noted, as can be seen in the above examples, that for many ancient eclipses, there usually exist several different astronomical solutions, all "enjoying equal rights". Hence, it is apparent that the inverse problem, namely restoration of the three chronological shifts on the GCD based only on astronomical data, cannot be solved reliably today.
2.11. The complete picture of astronomical shifts
We can now outline the complete picture of shifting the redated ancient eclipse dates forwards.
If the traditional date of an eclipse t~1. is represented by a point in the
time interval from 1600 B.C. to A.O. 1700, then it will necessarily fall on one of the chronicle lines C1, C2, C3, and C4 , which make up the GCD. C4, Ca, and C2 are moved forwards in the inverse shift by 1,778, 1,053, and 333 years, respectively. Meanwhile, they are again identified with the chronicle C1 embracing the events from A.O. 300 to 1619. The following important statement turns out to be valid.
The forward shift of an astronomically redated eclipse by the quantity t~t
t~~f. usually coincides with that of one of the chronicles C2, Ca, and C4 into
which the date t~~f. fell originally. However, the value of t~r - t~f. sometimes coincides with the difference or sum of certain of the three basic chronological shifts. In other words, the astronomical and chronological shifts are consistent.
Thus, all the dates t~~Y, of astronomically redated ancient eclipses are broken into certain groups, each of which is shifted forwards by about 1,778, 1,053, and 333 years, or their difference or sum. It is important that the relative posi
tion of the dates t~~1. inside each of these groups is then retained qualitatively and that the eclipses fall into the time interval A.O. 400-1800. This shift of the dates of ancient eclipses can also be described thus: If an eclipse has fallen into some copy of the interval Pon the GCD, then, redated
astronomically, its new date t~~r' is shifted forwards and gets into one of the
other replicas of P to the right of the traditional date t~~Y,. Further, it turns out that the majority of the dates of eclipses previously regarded as ancient are shifted into the time interval A.O. 800-1700 (5].
2.12. The coincidence of the astronomical shifts with the three basic chronological shifts in the global chronological diagram
We illustrate our statement regarding the coincidence of the astronomical shifts, arising in redating the eclipses, with the three basic chronological shifts on the GCD by several typical examples. (1) The triad of eclips~ described in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War (see Example 1 above) is closely related to the historical events in ancient Greece, traditionally dated for about the 5th century a.c. [8], [12]. As we have noted, the first eclipse mentioned by Thucydides is placed by



32 Problems of Ancient and Medieval Chronology Chapter 1
traditional chronology according to the ancient sources at around 431 B.c. (8]. Redated astronomically, its date was shifted forwards, and the eclipse was identified (see the second astronomical solution in Example 1) with the medieval one of A.O. 1039. Therefore, the value of the astronomical forward shifts
of the eclipse date is approximately equal to 1039 + 430 = 1469 years, which is close to the difference of two basic chronological shifts on the GCD, namely,
1778 - 333 = 1445 years.
(2) The lunar eclipse of Livy from Example 3 is closely related to the events in ancient Rome, which occurred, according to traditional chronology, in the middle of the 2nd century B.C. [8], [12]. Astronomically redated, it was also shifted forwards, and the eclipse was identified with the medieval one of A.O. 955, the first astronomical solution in Example 3. Thus, the astronomical shift forwards is approximately 1,100 years, which is close to the basic chronological shift on the GCD of 1,053 years. The shift makes the chronicle line C3 coincident with C1. (3) The lunar eclipse of Example 4 (see above) is inseparably linked with the events (the crucifixion) occurring, according to the traditional chronology, in about A .o. 33 [8]. Astronomically redated, it was shifted forwards, too, and identified either with that of A .o. 368 or 1075. In the former case, the astronomical shift is 335 years, which all but exactly coincides with the basic chronological 333-year shift of the chronicle line C2 on the GCD; in the latter, the shift forwards is
about 1075- 33 = 1042 years long, which is close to the astronomical shift by 1,053 years. We should not think that the three astronomical shifts discovered reflect any periodicity in the distribution of authentic eclipse dates belonging to the past. As a matter of fact, in case (1) in Example 1, the astronomically
exactly calculated date is only t~~t, A.O. 1039. The first and traditional date
of 431 B.C. is astronomically inexact and appears only under the pressure of chronological tradition, which a priori relates the historical events linked with Thucydides' eclipses to the 5th century B.C. However, the above date of 431 B.C. was obtained by the astronomers as the result of a forcibly strained calculation in order to satisfy the requirements of tradition (8].
§3. Traditional Chronology of the Flares of Stars and the Dating of Ancient Horoscopes
3.1. Ancient and medieval flares of stars. The star of Bethlehem
The important fact is that the three discovered chronological shifts on the GCD are very consistent with many other astronomical data not yet linked to the eclipses directly. For example, I have analyzed the traditional chronology of the flares of the so-called novae and supernovae. Let us list the flares of all such stars regarded as reliable in accordance with [3], [6]: 2296 and 2241 B.C., A.D. 185,393, 668, 902, 1006, 1054, 1184, and 1230, and those of the 16th century (see Kepler's list). The so-called star of Bethlehem described



§3 Flares of Stars and the Dating of Ancient Horoscopes 33
in the New Testament (Mt 2:3), i.e., a flare occurring in about A.O. 1, is also usually added. The study of the astronomical situation in about A.O. 1 with the purpose of discovering the remains of this famous "star" was taken up, for example, by J. Kepler and L. Ideler (see [1], pp. 128-129). In the chronological shift backwards by 1,053 years (which corresponds to the superposition of the
chronicle C3 on C1 + C2), the time interval A.O. 962-1250 is placed on the time interval 91 B.C.-A.O. 197 (see the chart).
Ancient History from 91 B.c. to A.O. 197 Medieval History in A .o. 962-1250
The complete list of the flares of stars The complete list of the flares in this epoch, fixed in antique sources, of stars in this epoch, fixed in 1s: medieval sources, is: the famous flare in A .D. 1; the flare in A.D. 1006; - the famous flare in A.D. 1054; the flare in A.O. 185. the flare in A.O. 1230.
(1) The famous "star" of A.D. 1 when (1) The famous flare in A.o. 1054 Christ was born (Mt 2:2, 8, 9-11). of the supernova in Taurus. Hildebrand was "born'' as reformer of the Church.
The dates of these flares are ideally coincident in shifting by 1,053 years (see the GCD).
(2) The flare in A .o. 1 was visible "in the east" (Mt 2:2,9) ( "The star which they saw in the east"). (3) The flare of the star in A .o. 185.
(2) The flare of the star in A.O. 1054 was visible "in the eastern sky" [6].
(3) The flare of the star in A.O. 1230
The dates of the flares in A .o. 185 and 1230 can also be made coincident under the same 1,053-year chronological shift with a difference of only 8 years.
(4) The star flare in A .o. 185 lasted 7 months [3), (6).
(4) The star flare in A.O. 1230 lasted 6 months (3), [6).
Thus, the dates (regarded as trustworthy) of all star flares from 900 B.C. to A.O. 390 are obtained from those of the medieval flares of stars from the 10th to the 13th century under the backward 1,053-year chronological shift. This new independent corroboration of the existence of the global 1,053-year chronological shift is interesting, since we have analyzed here the dates given by the written sources of quite irregular astronomical phenomena. Note that the previous traditional dating of these flares was carried out on the basis of a written chronological tradition of "nonastronomical origin".

3.2. Astronomical dating of ancient Egyptian horoscopes
We now turn to an analysis of the astronomical results of [2] of dating the zodiacal positions of the planets, which are described in certain historical sources, namely, the so-called horoscopes. Recall that all planets are placed near the ecliptic, relative to the stars (i.e., on the fixed astral sphere), and their position can be calculated similarly to the method of determining the dates of ancient eclipses. That is, we have to fix the positions of observable planets relative to the zodiacal constellations at some modern moment of time. Then, plotting integral multiples of the (known) sidereal periods of the planets backwards, we can, in principle, calculate horoscopes of the past, i.e., the position of the planets relative to the zodiac at a prescribed moment of time. Thus, if a horoscope is described in some historical source, then, proceeding analogously with the procedure of calculating ancient eclipse dates, we may attempt to date it. To this end, we have to compare its description in a historical text with the calculated tabular horoscopes and attempt to find a horoscope with the same characteristics. The seeming simplicity of this idea is made very complicated by the difficulties of the calculations and, which is most important, by various secondary reasons of "nonastronomical" character similar to those with which we are already familiar. In [2], Morozov analyzed the traditional dates of all the basic horoscopes fixed in the surviving ancient sources. Omitting the details, we inform the reader that the result was the same forward shifts of their dates obtained astronomically as occurred previously in the case of ancient eclipses. We give a typical example. The well-known Egyptologist W. Flinders Petrie in 1901 discovered in Upper Egypt (Athribis) an ancient Egyptian interment dated by the traditional chronology from the 1st century B.C. to the 1st century A.D. The interment was found to contain two graphic images of the planets on the zodiac. The two horoscopes probably indicated the dates of the two tombs. The specialist Knobel [7] attempted to date the horoscopes within the a priori time interval from the 1st century B.C. to the 1st century A.D. However, no exact astronomical solution was found. We make the precise statement that the a priori interval was determined, proceeding from the style and character of the inscriptions in the grave, due to which Knobel was forced to offer only quite approximate values, namely, A.D. 52 and 59. Knobel noted the imprecision, because the position of Venus at that time was different from its representation in the tombs. Then the Russian astronomer M.A. Vilyev analyzed all the horoscopes from 500 B.c. to A.D. 600; however, he discovered no exact astronomical solution for the Athribis horoscopes. Nevertheless, the extension of the search time interval and the application of the formal astronomical dating method led Morozov to the discovery of an exact astronomical solution, namely, A.D. 1049 and



§3 Flares of Stars and the Dating of Ancient Horoscopes 35
A.O. 1065 ((2), Vol. 6, p. 745). It is important that it is unique in the whole historical interval.
3.3. Astronomical dating of the horoscope described in the Book of Revelation
Consider another example. An exact astronomical solution for the horoscope described in the Book of Revelation was suggested by Morozov (2]. Though its descriptive characteristics can be extracted from the Book of Revelation only with some controversial interpretation, this circumstance does not encumber the application of the formal astronomical dating method. As it turns out, there are only two exact astronomical solutions in the whole historical time interval, namely, A.O. 395 and A.D. 1249, although the latter was rejected as "too late" ((2], Vol. 1, p. 53). Besides, it is less satisfactory astronomically. My analysis of the whole collection of horoscope datings given in [2] has shown that their forward chronological shift obtained by the formal astronomical method is also due to the same three basic ones on the GCD (Fig. 8). For example, the forward shift of the dates of the two Athribis horoscopes is approximately 1,000-1,050 years. Recall that traditional chronology dates them to about the beginning of the present millennium. Thus, the astronomical shift is close to the chronological one of 1,053 years (see Fig. 67 in Vol. 2 of this book). The same situation occurs in our last example, that of the Book of Revelation. The second of the two astronomical solutions for its horoscope, A.O. 1249, yields the forward shift of its creation by about 1,050-1,100 years. Note that the approximate traditional date of writing the Book of Revelation is, according to A. Harnack, Eberhard, J. Martineau, and van Eising, the second half of the 2nd century A.O. In this case, the value of the astronomical shift is thus also close to that of the chronological one by 1,053 years (Fig. 8). In conclusion, we indicate another interesting astronomical fact [2], which also turned out to agree with the discovered decomposition of the GCD into the sum of three shifted chronicles. The first Latin edition of Ptolemy's famous Almagest (published in A.O. 1537 in Cologne) contains a catalogue of stars with the indication of their longitudes and latitudes, i.e., coordinates on the celestial sphere. As is clear from the text, the catalogue was made by Claudius Ptolemy himself in the second year of the rule of the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius, traditionally related to A.O. 138-161. It turns out that there exists a reliable method to determine from its star catalogue the date when the Almagest was written [2]. Since it contains ecliptic star coordinates, we can make use of the generally known property of stars to annually increase their longitudes by 50"2 (due to precession). Dividing the difference between the longitudes indicated in the Latin edition and those of the present day by 50''2, we shall obtain the required date. This simple calculation unexpectedly shows that the longitudes of the stars listed in the first Latin edition of the Almagest were observed or

recalculated by its author in the 16th century A.D. Hence, these astronomical data belong to the time when the book was published. Morozov's work ([2], Vol. 4), supplies many other arguments in favour of the conjecture that this text was created by the astronomers of the 10th to the 16th century A.D. In our case, the forward shift of the date of writing the Almagest is about 700 or 1,390 years if obtained astronomically. Meanwhile, we compare the date A.D. 1530 (epoch of the first editions of the Almagest) with
A.D. 140 (second year of Antoninus Pius' rule). We obtain 1530-140 = 1390 years. The value of this shift is also completely consistent with the GCD



§3 Flares of Stars and the Dating of Ancient Horoscopes 37
(Fig. 7), since it practically coincides with the sum of the two basic chrono
logical shifts: 1053 + 333 = 1386 years. In such a forward shift of dates, the period of Antoninus Pius' rule falls into the epoch when the first editions of the Almagest appeared, namely, A .o. 1528, 1537, 1515(?), 1538, 1542, and 1551. Note, in conclusion, that immediately before this medieval epoch, the emperor Maximilian I Pius(!) Augustus (A.O. 1493-1519) had ruled in the medieval Empire of the Hapsburgs. It is interesting that he was a contemporary of A. Diirer, the creator of the astrographic charts that accompanied Ptolemy's Almagest. The prints were made by Diirer in about A.O. 1515. Therefore it cannot be excluded that it was under Maximilian Pius that the astronomical observations fixed in the Almagest were carried out (Fig. 9(2)). The statistical analysis of the latitudes in the star catalogue of the Almagest was made in the recent paper [15]. The result is as follows: the latitudes in the star catalogue of the Almagest were observed somewhere in the time-interval A.O. 600-1300. See also [16].

CHAPTER 2
NEW STATISTICAL METHODS FOR DATING
§4. Certain Statistical Regularities of Information Density Distribution in Texts with A Scale1
4.1. Text with a scale. The general notion
4.1.1. In the present paper, we list the results of a series of statistical investigations carried out by the author, and which led to the discovery (for narrative texts) of new statistical invariants such as the laws of information density conseroation.
By a text X with a scale P, we understand a text (e.g., a narrative one) endowed with a fixed program plan whose items are numbered by a parameter t. Meanwhile, we shall require that X should admit a unique partition associated with this parametrization (program), and such that (1) to each value of the parameter t E P, a certain part X(t) of the text may necessarily correspond; and, vice versa, (2) each phrase (or word) of the text T may necessarily belong to one and only one fragment X(t) for a certain t. We call such a program plan a scale, or parametrization of the text X.
We will say that the text X is parametrized by t, with X = U X(t), and
X(ti) n X(t2) =0 if t 1 -/= t2. teP Such parametrized texts X are well illustrated by those with historical character, e.g., historical monographs, chronicles, annals, college textbooks, diaries, and so forth. In these cases, the part of the parameter t is played by time, i.e., the dates of the events described (according to a system of chronology or any other method of their dating). Still, the above concept of a text with a scale is considerably more general than in the given example. In particular, the parameter t may range over more complicated domains than the set of natural numbers (dates of events). For

example, t can possess a continuous domain in the case where we take as a text with a scale the description of some physical continuous process parametrized by continuous time. Then we can consider the description of the instantaneous state as a "textual fragment" X(t) when the process of interest is going on. The description may be "composed" of some system characterizing the process continuously. Further, for the applications considered below, the following example is very important. We can assume that a scale P consists of a sequence of disjoint intervals (Ak, Bk) with integral endpoints. In other words, two intervals
(Ak, Bk) and (Ac, Be) are disjoint if k :/= c and the union of all of them makes up the initial segment (A, B), with the parameter t ranging over their entire sequence (see the details in Section 4.2.2).
4.1.2. Let X be a certain historical (or, more generally, narrative) text with a scale P, represented as the union of the fragments X(t). For simplicity, let the parameter t range over the positive or negative integers from A to B. For example, we can assume that X describes the events from the year A to the year B, though the quantities t, A, and B can then be measured not only in years, but, say, in months, days, or hours.
4.2. Information characteristics (i.e., informative functions) of a historical text. Volume function, name function, and reference function
4.2.1. Now, we associate each value of the parameter t with a set fi(t), /2(t),
... ,fN(t) of the formal information characteristics of part X(t) of a historical text X, which may describe the events of one year t. As we shall now see, the
quantitative information characteristics /i(t) can be quite multifarious. We illustrate this with some basic examples.
Example 1. Let fi(t) = vol~(t), where volX(t) is the number of lines, pages, signs, or words making up a textual fragment X(t). We then, obvi
ously, get fi(t) > 0, and LA<t<B fi(t) = 1, with V = volX denoting the
total volume of the text X without illustrations, diagrams, or bibliography.
The normalizing condition Lt fi (t) = 1 often happens to be convenient in various instances of such averaging and comparing and is a discrete analogue of the normalizing condition in the case of a continuous parameter, namely
J: /i(z)dz = 1.
Example 2. Let /2(t) = •~>, where s(t) is the number of references to a
year t in the entire text X, and S that of all the dates (years).
Example 3. Let /a(t) = mJ:>, where m(t) is the number of the names of
historical characters mentioned in a textual fragment X(t), and M that of all the names of all the historical characters from the text X. We shall sometimes also count the number of references to the names of historical figures in the fragment X(t), i.e., we shall take into account their multiplicity, or frequency, of use in the text.



§4 Information Density in Texts 41
Example 4. Let / 4 (t) = mJj-,tl, where m;(t) is the number of references
J
to some concrete name m; in a textual fragment X (t), and M; is the total number of references to m; in the entire text X. In general, this name can be ascribed to different historical characters. We shall give other important examples of the functions /i(t) below. We call them informative, or frequency functions, defined by X.
4.2.2. To determine f;.(t) means to formally compute an indicated numerical characteristic such as volume, the number of names, and so on, of all textual fragments X(t) of some concrete historical texts X, which may be arranged so that only the partitions of X into the sum of the fragments X(Ak, Bk) are specified uniquely, with X(Ak, Bk) denoting that part of X in which the events of the interval (Ai:, Bk) with integral endpoints are described. Meanwhile, their description inside X(A1:, Bk) may not be specifically related to the years composing (Ak, B1:), due to the convenience of considering an enlarged scale for a parameter which does not range over separate years but over separate time intervals, in which case we will denote it by T. It should be noted that, generally, there can exist several different scales for the same text X. Thus, the choice of a particular scale in X may vary in accordance with the problem posed. If a parameter T ranges over a sequence of time intervals (Ak, Bk), then the normalized volume function Ji (T) is determined
as Ji (T) = vol(~~itci::,.JA,.). In other words, we compute the average value of
the textual volume function in (A1:, Bi:), where vol(A1:, B1c) and vol(A, B) are
the values of the volume function in (A1:, B1c) and (A, B), respectively. The "averaged" functions for the other examples listed above are defined similarly. For example, vol(A1:, B1c) is the number of lines, pages, or words making
up the fragment X(A1:, B1:) that describes the events in the time interval (Ak, Bk)- Further, vol(A, B) is the total volume of the entire text X represented as the union of its disjoint fragments X(Ai:, Bi:). Thus, each informative function fi(t) is given by a certain graph defined on an interval (A, B). All the informative functions under investigation are nonnegative.
4.2.3. Denote by J(t), or f(t, X), some informative function /;.(t) for a text X, omitting the subscript i for brevity. Let two (or several) historical texts X and Y be given, which describe the events in an interval (A, B) of the history of one region (e.g., state, town, etc.). It is clear that the informative functions /(t, X) and /(t, Y) constructed for X and Y, respectively, will, in general, be different. This must be so, since their form is influenced by both the individual propensities of the authors and the general attitude toward the events characteristic of the time when the text was written. It is clear that a monograph on art history and one on military history devoted to the same period will accentuate various things differently, which can lead, for instance, to a different distribution of the textual volumes. A natural question thus arises: How essential are these differences in texts with a statistical approach to the analysis of their informative functions? In



42 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
other words, can we discover certain general, invariant characteristics of the informative functions f(t, X) and f(t, Y), which do not depend (or depend little) on the authors' tendencies, and which are determined mostly by the time interval (A, B) and the region f?
4.2.4. Let us investigate the behaviour of such important characteristics of the graphs of /(t,X) as the distribution of local maxima ("peaks"). Denote by ri(X) those years t of a time interval (A, B) in which the graph of f(t, X) attains local maxima, i.e., exhibits peaks. Let i vary from 1 to q(X), where q(X) is the total number of local maxima. In the case where the scale of the text X is enlarged (see the above example),
the informative function f is represented by a "steplike" graph. This step function is constant on each separate interval (Ak, Bk). It is then convenient to take its midpoint as a local maximum attained in (Ak, Bk), Consider the volume function volX(t) as a basic example. Its value at a
point t equals the volume of a textual fragment X(t), measured in pages,
lines, or words. What is the meaning of "the volume function vol X(t) reaches a local maximum at a certain point ri(X) in an interval (A, B)"? It means that the year ri(X) represented as a point in (A, B) is described in the text X in more detail, on a greater number of pages, and with more particulars than the nearby years. What can explain such a difference in the description of different years? One of the possible (and, probably, basic) reasons for this phenomenon can be formulated as follows. The author of X possessed more information for the year ri(X) (e.g., historical texts or more extensive documentation) than for the neighbouring years. It could be for this reason that the events of the year ri(X) of the epoch (A, B) have been described in more detail.
4.3. A theoretical model describing the distribution of local maxima for the volume function of a historical text. Primary stock. The information density conservation law
In Section 4.2.4, we formulated a theoretical model (statistical hypothesis) describing the distribution of local maxima for the textual volume function. We now designate by C(t) the total volume of all the texts written by contemporaries about the events of a year t. We shall measure the volume in lines (pages, words, etc.). It is clear that, in general, we cannot reconstruct the original form of the graph of C(t) today, which is due to a loss of the old texts with time. It is only the part K(t) of the primary information stock C(t) that has survived. I<(t) will be called the surviving information (textual) stock regarding the year t. Denote by Ci the years in which the volume graph for the primary stock C(t) has reached local maxima. It follows that especially many texts were written in these years (for particular reasons which we do not discuss here), i.e., the contemporaries have recorded a particularly large amount of written evidence about them. Let us ask ourselves the following question: What might be the statistical mechanism of loss and falling into oblivion of



§4 Information Density in Texts 43
textual information which leads to a gradual decrease of the amplitude of the volume graph for the primary stock C(t)? We formulate the following hypothesis. Though, with time, the amplitude of the volume graph for the surviving textual stock decreases gradually {since ancient texts get lost and destroyed), more remains from those years Ci whose events were described by contemporaries in a considerable number of texts.
In other words, the years Ci in which the volume graph for the primary stock C(t) reached local maxima must be close to those points ki in which that of the surviving stock K(t) attains local maxima. In particular, ci and ki must be close to those years ri(x) in which the volume graph vol X (t) of the text X dtiscribing the events in a time interval (A, B) has reached local maxima.
Since the volume graph for the primary stock C(t) is unknown, it is hard to verify the hypothesis stated in its present form. However, we can verify one of its important corollaries.
4.4. The correlation of local maxima for the volume graphs of dependent historical chronicles. The surviving-stock graph
4.4.1. Namely, the years of local maxima ri(X) should be close to those denoted by ri(Y) for any two historical texts X and Y describing one historical
epoch (A, B) in the history of the same region r. In other words, the volume graphs vol X(t) and vol Y(t) must attain local maxima, i.e., form peaks, approximately at the same points (years) in the time interval (A, B).
We call this corollary the F-model. To substantiate it intuitively and informally, we assume that two texts X and Y describe the events in a time interval (A, B) in the history of one region. Let this period be considerably removed in time from the authors of X and Y. This means that they are no longer contemporaries of the described ancient events and, therefore, have to employ a collection of historical sources surviving from the historical epoch (A, B), i.e., the surviving information stock. However, we can assume (without making a gross mistake) that this surviving textual set (information stock) is approximately the same for both X and Y. Hence, the volume graphs volX(t) and vol Y(t) must more or less simultaneously reflect the maxima of the graph
of the surviving stock while simultaneously reaching local maxima in (A, B). Thus, a chronicler describes in more detail those years from which more texts have been preserved. Recall that the years of the local maximum of the volume graph are characterized by especially much surviving information in comparison with the neighbouring ones. Another natural corollary to the basic hypothesis will be given in Section 4.7.2 (the K-model).
4.4.2. We should not think that the amplitudes themselves of the local maxima of the volume function (the absolute values of the textual volumes) of two historical texts describing the same events are close (even with normalizing).



44 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
Simple examples of concrete chronicles show that the values of vol X (Ti) and vol Y (ri) may be considerably different. Thus, the absolute values of vol X (ri) at the local maximum points ri vary upon altering the text X (i.e., depend on it), which shows that the discovery of the rough "invariants of historical epochs" should not be based on the absolute amplitudes of informative functions. The analysis of "fine amplitude invariants" was carried out by S.T. Rachev and the author.
4.4.3. Let us verify the theoretical F-model against the material of concrete texts (chronicles, etc.), for which we should first formulate the concept of proximity of two sequences of numbers ri(X) and ri(Y) of local maximum points for two texts X and Y, namely, their volume graphs can, in general, have different numbers of local maxima, and q(X) -:/; q(Y) (see above). However,
as will now be shown, without loss of generality, we can put q(X) = q(Y), for which it suffices to assume that certain ri(Y) coincide with some new,
additional local maxima to be added in the case where q(Y) < q(X). In other words, some maxima of the graph of vol Y(t) are declared to be multiple, i.e., we assume that several maxima coincide. Equalizing the number of local maxima for two volume graphs can be carried out differently and in accordance with the supposedly multiple maximum points and their multiplicity. We now choose a particular method for equalizing the number of maxima. In the following, we shall perform the minimization of the functions in question with the help of all such equalizing methods.
4.5. Mathematical formalization. The numerical coefficient d(X, Y), which measures the "distance" between two historical texts X and Y
4.5.1. We now describe the mathematical formalization. The points ri(X) break the time interval (A, B) into smaller intervals whose lengths are given by
the integers a1,a2, ... ,ap, where a 1 = r 1 -A, ai = ri-ri-1 for 2 < i < q(X),
and ap = B - rp-l, their number being p = q(X) + 1. Therefore, we can
define a certain integral vector a(X) = (a1(X), ... ,ap(X)) belonging to the Euclidean space RP of dimension p. Since the sum of all ai is, obviously, equal to B - A, the length of (A, B), we can assume that the endpoint of a(X) lies on a (p - 1)-dimensional simplex u, which can be given by the equation
Ef= 1 Xi = B - A, where Xi are nonnegative Euclidean coordinates for the
space RP. The simplex <Tisa closed subset, i.e., with the boundary belonging to it, which follows from the fact that some ai can be zero (the case of multiple maxima).
Now, let us consider two historical texts X and Y. We can construct two integral vectors a(X) and a(Y) with their endpoints on one and the same simplex u (Fig. 10). Meanwhile, we assume that both texts describe events on the same time interval (A, B). Note that we have made use here of the above remark according to which we can assume that the volume graphs for both texts have the same number of local maxima.

Figure 10. Method for comparison of two historical texts X and Y. We can construct and compare two integral vectors.
Consider the difference~ of the two vectors a(Y) and a(X). The vector~ belongs to our simplex (Fig. 10 . Let A be the usual Euclidean length of the

We now introduce the numerical coefficient d(X, Y) = vo~0f~u ,where D =
D( X, A) denotes a (p - 1)-dimensional ball placed in the hyperplane specified
by the equation I:f=1 Xi = B - A. This ball is centered at a(X) and has
the radius A, while D nu denotes its intersection with the simplex. If A is large, then the ball D may contain points located outside the simplex. If, however, the number A is small, and the point a(X) (the center of the ball) does not lie on the boundary of the simplex, then the ball D(X, .\) is small and wholly contained in the simplex, in which case we have the equality
Dnu = D. Finally, volS, where Sis an arbitrary (p-1)-dimensional subset in
the hyperplane I:f= 1 Zi = B -A, denotes either the usual Euclidean (p- 1)
dimensional volume of the subset S (in which case we will say that we are dealing with a continuous model) or the number of integral points in the set S. Recall that a point is said to be integral if its Euclidean coordinates are integers. In the latter case, we will say that we are dealing with a discrete model.



46 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
4.5.2. Assume that a text X is fixed. While varying the text Y, it becomes obvious that the number d(X, Y) which we introduced in Section 4.5.1 can be interpreted (under certain natural assumptions) as the probability of the point a(Y) getting randomly into the ball D with fixed radius ,\ and with its center at a(X). This probabilistic interpretation is not at all essential for the following and is given here only as a formalism which is useful for the calculations. We now introduce on our simplex a (p - i)-dimensional measure μ in the following two ways:
Version 1 μ(S) = number of ii;itegral poii;its ii;i the d<?main S consistent with the
• number of integral pomts m the simplex
discrete model (see above).
Version 2. μ(S) = Eucli~ean volume of t he d~main S consistent with the continu
Euchdean volume of the simplex
ous model, where Sis a (p- I)-dimensional domain (subset) in the simplex <1.
Further, to interpret the coefficient d(X, Y) probabilistically, we need a hypothesis regarding the distribution of the random vector a(Y) on the simplex. In the simplest case, we assume that a(Y) is uniformly distributed on the simplex, which means that the probability that it gets into some domain S
equals the measure μ(S). Since μ(u) = 1, 0 < μ(S) < 1. Applied to our problem, this conjecture can be confirmed somewhat by the distribution of the random vector a(Y) being consistent with that of the local maxima of the volume graphs vol Y(t) for a variable text Y and a variable historical epoch (A, B) with invariable A - B. Since we intend to model the mechanism of information loss and the fall into oblivion, we should take into account the circumstance that if an archive of historical documents is lost during some sort of disaster, or similar circumstances, then it is appropriate to accept the hypothesis that the destruction of any text from this archive is "equally likely" . The assumption can be restated as a conjecture regarding the uniform distribution of the random vector a(Y), where the text Y ranges over all the texts surviving from all possible historical epochs. To describe this distribution of the local maximum random vector formally is unreal for the moment, because we should calculate all the vectors a(Y) for all surviving historical texts Y, which is, obviously, impossible. We could certainly investigate a sufficiently large sample from the set of all existing texts; however, certain complicated problems regarding the representability of such samples and their homogeneity arise here. Besides, such an experimental approach could considerably distort the general form of the distribution, since it is difficult to estimate a priori whether a particular sample from the texts reflects the real mechanism of information loss. At the same time, the assumed uniformity of the distribution of the random vector a(Y) well reflects the circumstance that by altering the historical epoch (A, B), we "uniformly mix" all possible reasons for the loss of historical texts. In certain examples related to other methods of dating (see below), where the total information requiring quantitative processing is sufficiently clear, we have experimentally calculated the desired distribution of the random



§4 Information Density in Texts 47
vector. For example, we have found the empirical frequency histogram for the distribution of the duration of kings' reigns. We would like to emphasize once again that the probabilistic interpretation of the coefficient d(X, Y) will not be employed below. First, we carry out an experimental calculation of the concrete limits within which d(X, Y) varies for "dependent historical texts" describing the same events. It is the values of d(X, Y) found experimentally that in the following will serve as a standard for comparing other pairs of texts under investigation. The coefficient d(X, Y) ranges from zero to unity. With the assumed uniform distribution, we can say that the smaller its magnitude, the lower the
probability of the random event that the random vector a( Z) distributed on the simplex uniformly happened to be from the vector a(X) at a distance not exceeding the observable one between the points (vectors) a(X) and a(Y). If..\, the distance between a(X) and a(Y), is sufficiently large, then d(X, Y) may be unity, in which case the above ball D wholly absorbs the simplex u. Therefore, no statement regarding a possible proximity of the texts X and Y can be formulated; these texts are far from each other from the standpoint of their volume functions. Note that, for any X and Y describing one historical epoch (A, B), we can always find the same scale P, which permits us (in principle, at least) to compare even texts of various nature, namely, textbooks, annals, and so forth. Section 4.6 is of formal mathematical character and may be omitted on first reading.
4.6. Mathematical formulas for computing d(X, Y). Mathematical corrections of the maxima correlation principle
4.6.1. In this section, we give certain mathematical formulas for computing
and estimating d(X, Y). If a simplex u is specified by the equation I::f= 1 Xi = s, where all Xi are nonnegative, then its volume in the continuous model, i.e.,
in the usual Euclidean volume, equals ~ Hence,
where s = B - A, ..\ is the length of the vector a(Y) - a(X), and r is the classical gamma function. For small ..\, the inequality turns into an equality. If B - A, and p and ,;\ are all sufficiently small, then we have to make use
of the discrete model to calculate d(X, Y) (see above). In order to do this, we have to find the number of integral points in the ball D and the simplex <1 for the given values of B - A, p, and .-\. Unfortunately, an exact universal formula cannot be offered in this case; however, we can derive an asymptotic relation, which is omitted due to lack of space. We can estimate this mathematically, beginning with which numerical values of B -A, p, and,;\ it is possible to resort to the continuous model without



48 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
committing a gross mistake. As a matter of fact, concrete calculations are more simple within the framework of the continuous than the discrete model. Any concrete numerical estimation is also omitted. Note, in this connection, that an interesting mathematical problem arises here: How can an exact boundary be found, separating the area of application of the discrete model from that of the continuous one (for a prescribed value of admissible error)?
4.6.2. We now indicate the first mathematical correction to the F-model. Since, when equalizing the numbers of the local maxima of the volume graphs of two texts being compared, we are forced to assume certain of the coordinates ai of the vector a(Y) to be equal to zero in the case where q(Y) < q(X), this process is explicitly equivocal. It is clear that we can take any of a 1 to ap as the zero coordinate. We should therefore consider all possible methods of equalizing the numbers of the maxima and then take the least of all the values obtained as the coefficient d(X, Y). To eliminate the asymmetry between the texts X and Y due to the definition of d(X, Y), we have to "symmetrize" the value, i.e., consider d(X,Y);d(Y,X).
4.6.3. Now we present the second correction of the F-model. We have carried out previous constructions for informative functions of the form J(t, X). However, we should also consider all their possible smoothings in order to establish the invariant, characteristic properties of the graphs better. For example, as the simplest method of smoothing a graph, we can consider the "neighbourwise averaging". For a function f(t), its first smoothing is then constructed as
S1 f(t) = J(t-I)+J~t)+J(t+l)' the second, S2J(t), as the expression S1(S1 /(t)), and so on. It is evident that this procedure smoothes the graph and eliminates random, small local maxima. Their corresponding coefficient d; (X, Y) is computed after each stage of the smoothing procedure applied to Si J(t, X) and Si f(t, Y). As the final value of d(X, Y), we should again take the least of all numbers obtained in such a manner. Having calculated d{X, Y) for the original and nonsmoothed graphs f(t, X) and f(t, Y), we obtain an upper estimate of the final value of the coefficient. Note that if we are comparing two texts X and Y which describe different historical epochs of the same length, then we should make these intervals coincident on the time axis by superimposing.
4.6.4. The third mathematical correction of the F-model is as follows. For greater statistical invariance of the obtained results, we should compare not simply a pair of separate texts X and Y, but two sufficiently large groups of texts X 1, ... , X n and Y1 , ... , Ym, where n and m are supposed to be sufficiently large. Denote the first text group by {X}, and second by {Y}. Then we
have to compare the graphs of the functions /(t, {X}) = /(t, X1, ... , Xn) and
f(t, {Y}) = f(t, Y1, ... , Ym), where f(t, {X}) is the averaged function defined
by the equality /(t, {X}) = 1⁄4E?=t /(t, X,). The averaged graphs /{t, {X})
and /(t, {Y}) so formed have been freed of the random local maxima which might have appeared in one or the other text for some particular reason of nonuniversal character. The comparison of the averaged graphs yields a more reliable statistical picture of the evolution in time of written evidence.



§4 Information Density in Texts 49
4.7. Verification of the maxima correlation principle against concrete historical material
4. 7 .1. Let us now verify the F-model against some concrete historical material. This model will be confirmed if the coefficient d(X, Y) is "small" for the majority of pairs of real historical texts X and Y describing the "same" events in the same time interval (A, B) (we call such texts dependent). On the contrary, for independent texts, i.e., those describing essentially different events (or essentially different time intervals), this coefficient must be "large". For now, the concept of smallness for the coefficient will not formally be made precise, since we need more experimental data. Meanwhile, the broad statistical experience of natural science permits us to estimate (with the assumption of the uniform distribution of the random vector a(Y)) really small probabilities in problems of this kind. Since the explicit construction (from texts) and description of informative graphs for concrete historical texts of large size are sufficiently bulky, we are forced to omit the diagrams here and will give only some typical examples. We first consider the textual volume function vol X(t) (the volume is measured in pages; see also Section 4.2). For example, we have taken the monograph of V.S. Sergeev, Essays on the History of Ancient Rome [1], as the text X, and the famous History of Rome by Livy [2] as the text Y. The time interval (A, B) described in both books was taken from 758 to 288
B.c., which means that A= -757, B = -287, and the length of the interval B - A= 470 years. The "-" sign denotes the years B.C. The volume graphs of these texts (with respect to years) are shown in Fig. 11. The continuous line has been constructed for Sergeev's text, and the dotted one for Livy's.
As it turns out, A = 21, p = 14, and the coefficient d(X, Y) measuring the

50 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
proximity of the vectors a(X) and a(Y) in the statistical sense equals 2•10- 12 . The distance between them in the Euclidean sense is 21. In other words, the probability of random proximity of the texts X and Y (at the distance A= 21) is majorized by 2 • 10- 12 . We had obtained it even before minimizing d with respect to smoothing all the graphs (see Section 4.6.3). Therefore, 2 • 10-12 is the upper estimate of the final value of the coefficient. Being very small, it indicates a considerable correlation between the historical texts by Sergeev and Livy from the point of view of the volume graphs. It is but natural, because, describing the "same events", they are a priori dependent. The most important is not the small absolute value of d(X, Y), but the large difference between the values of d(X, Y) for dependent pairs X, Y and independent pairs X, Y. Similar results are also obtained for the comparison of the different informative functions /i(t, X) and /;(t, Y) for dependent X and Y, which describe the same events in the same time interval (A, B).For example, consider for the above historical texts X by Sergeev and Y by Livy the informative function '2(t, X) = ,~), where s(t) = number of mentions of a year t in X. Compare
its graph with the volume graph vol Y(t) for Y. We have thus considered the
time interval from 521 to 294 B.C., i.e., A= -520, B = -293, and the length
B - A =227. It turns out that A =8, p =8. The result of the calculations is
d(vol Y(t), / 2(t, X)) = 5. 10-6 . In the latter example, we have smoothed the graphs once, i.e., compared
the graphs of S1'2(t, X) and S1 vol Y(t). Such a small value of the coefficient
measuring the probability with which the vectors a(vol Y(t)) and a(/2(t, X))
may randomly be at the distance A = 8 explicitly expresses the correlation between different informative functions of dependent texts describing the same period in the history of the same region or state. These results indicate the existence of another special law of information density conservation to be formulated as a /(-model below. Similar results are obtained when investigating other pairs of historical texts. I performed the computational experiment with the help of M. Zamaletdinov (Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow University).
4.7.2. We now formulate another natural model of the evolution of written information. If a historical text X describes events in a time interval (A, B), then there is a correlation between the different informative functions constructed for X. For example, the graphs /i(t,X) and f;(t, Y) for different i and j attain local maxima at approximately the same points (years) in (A, B). The K-model (statistical hypothesis) is subject to all the mathematical corrections indicated above for the F-model; accordingly, we do not give them here. Its intuitive substantiation can be extracted from the following observation. Say, if a year t from a time interval (A, B) is described in a historical text X in more detail than the neighbouring years, then this circumstance must lead not only to a local increase of the number of pages in X, which will have bearing



§4 Information Density in Texts 51
on the function Ji, but also to an increase of references to the year t (this has
bearing on the function h), while the number of names of historical characters mentioned at the same time in X increases locally, too (which has bearing on the function / 3), and so on. Roughly speaking, the longer a textual fragment X(t), the more names are mentioned there. Certainly, all these statements (models) are valid only "on the average" and for large time intervals. It is easy to see that the K-model is, actually, a corollary to the same basic statistical hypothesis (information density conservation law) formulated in Section 4.3 and is modelling the mechanism of loss and the fall into oblivion of written evidence. To derive the K-model from it, it suffices to apply the
hypothesis to an arbitrary pair of informative functions /i and /; (and not
only to the volume function /i = vol). In this sense, both the F- and the K-model can be regarded as corollaries to the basic hypothesis of 4.3.1.
4. 7.3. We now turn to the verification of the I<-model against concrete historical data. It will be confirmed if the vectors a(/i (X)) and a(/; (X)) are proximal for most sufficiently large concrete texts X, i.e., if the number d(/i(X), I; (X)) is sufficiently small. Omitting the diagrams, I shall give just one typical example.
Sergeev's monograph Essays on the History of Ancient Rome was again taken as a text X for which the volume function vol X (t) and the frequency of mentioning particular dates (years) h(t, X) have been calculated. It turns out that these two graphs are strongly correlated, i.e., their peaks practically
coincide. The calculations have shown that A = 25, p = 11, and B - A = 280
years (A = 241 B.C., and B = 521 B.c.). Finally, d(vol X(t), f 2(t, X)) =
7 · 10-5 • Similar results have been obtained for other chronicles, textbooks, monographs, and so forth, which we investigated. This confirms the K-model. The values of the coefficients obtained in the experiment are close to those obtained by us earlier in verifying the F-model against necessarily dependent pairs of historical texts.
4.7.4. We should not think that the coefficient d(/i(X),/;(Y)) is generally small for the arbitrary texts X, Y, and the functions /i, /;. If it were so, then the extreme smallness of the numbers d obtained above (for texts known a priori to be dependent) would not reveal anything. Recall that, with the assumed uniform distribution of the random vector on a simplex, all points of this simplex are treated equally during the random walk of the vector a(Y) (and for a fixed vector a(X)). Hence, when the vector a(Y) is moving farther from a(X), the ball D(X, A) enlarges, and the coefficient d(X, Y) approaches unity (the ball occupies a greater and greater part of the simplex). Concrete computations were then carried out for the independent historical texts X and Y, i.e., texts describing events or periods of history (A, B) and (C, D) known a priori to be different. It turned out that the coefficient d was of the order of unity for a small number of local maxima. For a large number of maxima, this lower bound of the coefficient values for independent texts



52 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
decreases but continues to be several orders greater than its upper bound for a priori dependent texts. We illustrate this with a typical example. Consider the first and second halves of Sergeev's text as X and Y. They describe different historical epochs, namely, the periods (A, B) from 521 to 381 B.C., and (C, D) from 381 to 241 B .c. in the history of ancient Rome. The functions f2(t, X) and f2(t, Y) represent the frequencies of mentioning particular dates (years) in the texts.
It then turns out that A = 59, B - A = D - C = 140 years, and p = 5.
Finally, d = 1/3, which is close to unity in contrast to the above examples of dependent texts.
4. 7.5. Our computational experiments confirm both of the theoretical hypotheses, i.e., the F- and K-models. We thereby discover specific laws of information density conservation in historical texts describing sufficiently large time intervals. They are partly manifest in certain quantitative characteristics of textual informative functions such as the distribution of local maxima. Though their intuitive substantiation seems to be rather clear (see above), the number of parameters of the informative functions, which can play the role of "historical epoch invariants", does not at all include all of them. For example, the absolute amplitudes of the volume graphs, the frequencies of names, and so forth, can be substantially different even for a priori dependent texts. The amplitude is, therefore, not an invariant of the period. The discovery of other "dependent text invariants" is a nontrivial problem and requires more statistical research.
4.8. A new method for dating historical events. The method of restoring the graph of the primary and surviving information stock
4.8.1. We now offer a new method for dating historical events described in ancient texts. The laws of information density conservation permit us to introduce a formal procedure to date the events described in texts with lost or unknown dating. In fact, let Y be a historical text with undated events. Let it be supplied with dates according to some unknown chronology. For example, let the years t be counted from the unknown absolute date of the foundation of some city.
We can assume, nevertheless, that the text Y is parametrized by a time t in the period between the years C and D according to the unknown chronology. How can we restore the absolute dates of the events? Construct the informative functions fi(t, Y) and consider the set of all absolutely dated texts X. We also construct their informative functions /i(t, X) and assume that we can choose X with some /i(t, X), or at once their whole set, close in the sense of smallness of the coefficient d to an informative function /i(t, Y). In other words, d(/i(X), /i(Y)) is "small" (i.e., it is close to the values of the coefficient d(fi(Z), /i(V)) f~r surely dependent pairs Z and V). It then means that within the framework of the F- or /(-model substantiated by us, the texts X and Y may be dependent. In particular, the time interval



§4 Information Density in Texts 53
(C, D) is close to (A, B) described in X or simply coincides with (A, B). Moreover, the smallness of d will indicate not only a possible proximity of the time intervals (A, B) and (C, D), but also that of the events and the historical epochs described (and even the coincidence). Meanwhile, it is important to bear in mind that the descriptions of the same events in X and Y can be outwardly different, with different names or nicknames of the historical characters, different geographical names, and so on. For example, the texts X and Y can be two versions of the description (chronicle) of the history of a region or state, but written in different languages, by different chroniclers, in different countries, or according to different chronologies.
4.8.2. Let X 1 , ... , X k be the collection of certain historical texts describing events in the same time interval (A, B). Consider the averaged function of
their volumes, i.e., I<(t) = vol(t; X1, ... , Xt) = 1⁄2E;=l vol X; (t).
If the quantity of texts (i.e., the number k) is sufficiently large, then the graph of I<(t) can be assumed, due to the computational experiments described above, to be coincident with (or close to) the graph of the original or surviving information stock C(t) or I<(t), respectively. Meanwhile, the local maxima of the graph of /{(t) indicate those years in the time interval (A, B) for which an especially large amount of written information (texts) has survived. This circumstance can help in dating available ancient historical texts. Namely, especially extensive texts (describing individual years) must concentrate close to the local maximum points of the graph of I< (t). To avoid a misunderstanding, we stress once again that dating a text here implies dating the events described in it. Besides, the text itself can have been written quite recently, e.g., a textbook on ancient history.
4.9. The discovery of dependent (parallel) historical epochs traditionally regarded as different
4.9.1. From 1978 to 1979, I made a series of experiments for calculating the coefficients d(/i(X), /i(Y)) for different pairs of historical surveys X and Y which embrace considerable historical periods (A, B) and (C, D) of the same
length, i.e., B-A = D-C. This condition is necessary for a formal comparison of the informative functions of different texts.
Unexpectedly, pairs of historical epochs (A, B) and (C, D) traditionally regarded as different (and pairs of corresponding texts X and Y which describe them) were discovered for which the coefficient d turned out to be extremely small, i.e., characteristic of a priori dependent texts (epochs). Let me give one example. Let Z be the part of F. Gregorovius' work History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages [3] embracing the events in medieval Rome from A.D. 300 to
754. In other words, A = 300, and B = 754. As a text Y, we take the part of Livy's History of Rome ((21) describing the antique history of Rome from the year 1 since the foundation of the City (Rome) to the year 459 since the



54 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
foundation of the City. It is traditionally ~umed that the year 1 since the foundation of the City coincides with 753 B.C. Therefore, we can take the 460
year-long interval from 753 to 294 B.c. as (C, D).Traditional history certainly regards these two texts, and the events described by them, as independent in
all respects. However, the computation shows that d(Z, Y) = 6 -10- 10 for the volume function, which means that, due to the smallness of the coefficient, the two texts and epochs are "like" dependent texts or epochs. Recall that Sergeev's text X [1] is necessarily dependent on Livy's text Y [2]. This circumstance was confirmed above by a calculation according to which
d(X, Y) = 2 -10- 12 . We should, therefore, expect that from the standpoint of the coefficient d, Gregorovius' and Sergeev's texts, i.e., Z and X, respectively, will turn out to be dependent. Computations fully confirm this assumption, too.
4.9.2. It is interesting to investigate the behaviour of d by enlarging the textual time scale. For example, let the parameter t now range not over years, but over separate half-centuries. As a text Z, we take the part of Gregorovius' book [3] which describes medieval Rome from A.O. 300 to 950, i.e., during a 650-year-long time interval. As a second text, X, we take the part of Sergeev's book [1] describing the events in ancient Rome from the year 1 to 650 since the foundation of the City, i.e., from 753 to 103 B.C. (assuming that the year 1 since the foundation of the City coincides with 753 B.c.). Ranging over halfcenturies, the parameter t, therefore, assumes 13 values in the indicated time
interval. Calculations show that d(Z, X) = 1/50. Here, we have made use of the textual volume graphs. Similar results are valid for the information function /2 both for the initial (where t ranges over separate years) and the enlarged time scale. The order of the coefficient d remains practically unaltered also in smooth
ing the graphs of the functions Ji and / 2 , which indicates the stability of the results relative to the smoothing, or averaging operation. We can also see here the advantages of "long time scales", when the length of the time interval described in the texts is of the order of 100-1,000 years. With the functions /i(X) and /i(Y) being correlated, the coefficient d then turns out to be especially small for dependent texts. Enlarging the scale certainly makes the picture rougher, which affects the increase of d. In the example given, it increased to 1/50.
4.10. The dynasty of rulers and the durations of their reigns as an important informative function
We now give an example of another important textual informative function. Consider a continuous (or gap-free) sequence R of some rulers (kings) R1 , . . . , Rn. Let them be indexed by an integral parameter i whose increase is associated with ordering the kings chronologically. As the informative func
tion, we take the duration of a rule, i.e., let / 5(i) = the duration of the rule of



§4 Information Density in Texts 55
king Hi who is ith in order. The sequence (dynasty) of the rulers R1, ... , R..ri will be called a dynastic stream for short. Along with a sequence of numbers representing the durations of the rules, we can define (as above) the vector a( R) of the local maximum points of this graph, which permits us to compare two sequences of rulers by comparing the graphs of the durations of their reigns. The difference from the previous algorithm lies in the fact that the proximity coefficient d must be calculable in a more complicated way for two dynasties, which is related to the impossibility of regarding the random vector which schematically represents the graph of the rule durations in a dynasty to be distributed uniformly. Because of lack of space, we omit the details of this investigation. It turns out that the distribution of the durations of the reigns of kings (monarchs) is subject to a sufficiently nontrivial law which forms the basis for defining the proximity coefficient for two dynasties.
4.11. Frequency distribution of the rules of kings who lived fro1n A.D. 1400 to 1800 and from 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1800
Figure 12 represents the result of processing the numerical information regarding the durations of reigns contained in J. Blair's chronological tables (4]. The rule durations of historical characters of Europe and of the Mediterranean region are marked off on the horizontal axis S in the time interval from 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1800, where the parameter S ranges not over separate years of a reign, but pairs of years, i.e., 1-2 years, 3-4 years, 5-6 years, ... , 89-90 years.
Further, the values of the following function, P(S) = number of historical
characters whose rule duration lies in the interval S, are marked off on the vertical axis P. For example, there were 55 personages (included in Blair's tables) ruling from 19 to 20 years. The dotted line in Fig. 12 represents the frequency distribution of the rules of those kings who lived from A .D. 1400 to 1800. The continuous line describes those kings who lived from 3000 B.c. to A .D. 1800 according to traditional chronology. In the investigation of the complete lists of the European and Mediterranean rulers from 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1800, I was assisted by M. Zamaletdinov and P. Puchkov. The proximity coefficient d for two dynasties should be calculated by taking into account the above histogram of the rule duration frequency. The following experiment also indicates the necessity of resorting to it. All 1200 rulers listed in Blair's chronological tables were aligned in sequence, ordered chronologically inside one dynasty (in one region). Simultaneous reigns were placed in line one after another. We now index the obtained sequence of rulers by
i = 1, 2, ... , 1200. Let ei be the random variable representing the duration
of the ith king's rule. Consider another random variable '1i(k) = !i+k· The
sequence '1 is thus obtained from eby shifting as a rigid block through k units
(numbers). Let r(k) be the correlation coefficient for { and 77(k). The graph
of the variable r(k) for 1 < k < 300 is shown in Fig. 13. The calculations have been performed on a computer by P. Puchkov. We do not have the space here

4.12. The concept of statistically parallel historical texts and epochs
We now formulate the concept of formal, statistical isomorphism (parallel) of historical texts and epochs. Let a time interval (A, B) in the history of some
region or state M be described in the historical texts X = {X 1, ... , X k}. Let
another time interval (C, D) in the history of another and, in general, different
region or state H be described in the texts Y = {Y1 , ... , Yp}. Consider the set of informative functions /i(X) and /;(Y) of these collections of texts. We will say that the above historical epochs (texts) are formally isomorphic (parallel) if the proximity coefficients d(fi(X), /i(Y)) are "small". More precisely, they must be as small as those of a priori dependent texts (epochs). The concept of formal isomorphism of epochs described in some historical texts does not at all mean that the epochs or events themselves are identical. Their isomorphism (parallelism) can indicate the convention of ascribing, for some reason, certain historical documents from one epoch to another. Our goal is to solve the global problem, i.e., to describe the collection of all parallel epochs and texts in the whole historical period of written language (see below) for which we extend the stock of informative functions.
4.13. The "written biography" or enquete-code of a historical character
4.13.1. Very heterogeneous historical information has survived concerning the ancient dynasties of rulers. Meanwhile, different sources speaking of the same ruler can be very different in the details concerning the description of his or her activity. Sources can deal with the events during the monarch's rule differently, characterize differently the rulers themselves, and refer to them by different names or nicknames, and so on. But there exist more or less "invariant" facts whose description is less dependent on a bias or political pressure on the chroniclers. One of these "invariant" parameters, for example, is the duration of a king's rule. Usually, there are no special reasons for which a chronicler would like to considerably distort this value (since it is emotionally neutral). By a "dynasty" of kings, we will understand a continuous (i.e., gap-free) sequence of rulers of one region. We do not assume that the throne should always be passed on hereditarily (from father to son, etc.). With each ruler or prominent statesman playing an important role in a particular period of history, we associate a certain table called an enquete-code, or "formal biography". By a "written biography" of a historical character, we will understand the collection of all preserved evidence about him or her. Normally, this "biography" is a set of individual facts which are rather uncoordinated and traditionally ascribed to the "ruler" by the later historians and chronologists based on the systematization and dating of the available written evidence. Besides, arising from the investigation of the primary sources, this "biography" can have almost nothing to do with the actual biography of the ruler. Strictly speaking, in many cases, we can only guess at



58 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
the ruler's real biography. Therefore, we only deal with "written biographies" in the following. Now, we associate each "written biography" established in the primary sources with the enquete-code, or "formal biographi', by possibly distinguishing all the basic facts from the "written biography". In doing so, we hierarchically order the facts of the "formal biography" in accordance with their decreasing invariance. The facts most often distorted by chroniclers will be nearer the end of the table. (1) Sex of a personage: (a) male, (b) female. (2) Length of life of the personage (or at least the year of death). (3) Duration of the rule. It should be noted here that the end of the rule is nearly always fixed uniquely by the chronicles. It is usually the death of the ruler. The beginning of the rule sometimes (though, rather rarely) admits several versions, among which are the official coronation date, those of conferring the title of "Caesar" or "Augustus", and of the death of a more powerful co-ruler, and so on. During the statistical investigation, all possible versions of the beginning of a rule are then indicated by all available means, considered to be equally likely, and included in the enquete-code. Note that, in analyzing real chronicles, we found that the number of versions of the date of the beginning of a rule only rarely reached three. (4) Social status: (a) emperor, king, queen, etc., (b) army commander, (c) politician, public figure, or statesman, (d) scientist, (e) religious leader (pope, bishop, high priest, prophet, etc.). (5) Cause of death of the personage: (a) natural, (b) on the battlefield, or as the result of a mortal wound, (c) result of conspiracy in peace time, (d) result of conspiracy in war time, (e) due to some special, exotic circumstance. (6) Natural disasters during the personage's rule: (a) hunger, (b) floods, (c) epidemic diseases, (d) earthquakes, (e) volcanic eruptions. The duration of the event and the year (or years) when it occurred are noted by all available means. (7) Astronomical phenomena during the rule: (a) did occur, (b) did not occur, (c) solar or lunar eclipses, (d) appearance of comets (often as "swords" in the sky, etc.), (e) "star" flares, (f) horoscopes, i.e., the planetary positions relative to the zodiacal constellations. (8) Wars during the rule of the personage: (a) did take place, (b) did not take place. (9) Number of wars (different wars are usually separated in chronicles). ( 10) Basic time characteristics of the wars B1, B2, ... , Bp. Namely, a,:
year of the king's rule in which the war numbered k, i.e., B1:, took place; h1: =
duration of the war B,:; C1:z = distance in years between the wars Bk and Bz.
(11) Intensity of the war Bk for each k. The intensity of a war can be estimated, for example, by the volume of texts in chronicles devoted to it. Roughly speaking, wars can be divided into two classes, namely, (a) largescale wars, (b) local wars. (12) Allies, adversaries, and neutral forces in a war B1: (for each k); their



§4 Information Density in Texts 59
number and schematic diagram of their relations (who are allies or enemies, etc.). (13) Geographical localization of a war Bk (for each k): (a) near or inside the capital, (b) inside the state, (c) outside the state and where exactly (external war), (d) both external and internal war simultaneously, (e) civil war or a war with external enemy. (14) Final result of the war: (a) victory, (b) defeat, (c) uncertain result. (15) Peace talks: (a) concluding a peace treaty after the victory of one of the adversaries (who exactly; see paragraph (12)), (c) concluding a peace treaty after the defeat of the ruler. (16) Conquering the capital: (a) did occur, (b) did not occur, (c) specific circumstances of the capital's siege or its fall. (17) Fate of the peace treaty: (a) it was violated (by whom and under what circumstances), (b) was not violated during the rule. (18) Detailed description of conquering (or fall of) the capital during the war. (19) Diagram of the armies' marches during the war. (20) Ruler's participation in the war: (a) did occur, (b) did not occur. (21) Conspiracies during the ruler's lifetime: (a) did occur, (b) did not occur. (22) Geographical localization of wars, allies, adversaries. (23) Name of the capital. A translation of the name is necessary. (24) Name of the state. Translation is necessary. (25) Geographical localization of the capital (with the terms translated). (26) Geographical localization of the state (with the terms translated). (27) Legislative activities of the ruler (a) reforms and their nature, (b) issuing of new code of laws, (c) reintroduction of former laws (which exactly). (28) Complete list of all names of the ruler with their translations. As a matter of fact, practically all ancient names have meaningful translations and originally were simply nicknames (such as "mighty", etc.). (29) Ethnic group of the ruler, members of his or her family, composition of the family. (30) Ethnic group of people living in the region or city. (31) Founding of new cities, capitals, fortresses, harbours, etc. (32) Religious situation: (a) introduction of a new religion, (b) sectarian struggle (between what sects exactly, names of the leaders and their translations), (c) religious riots and wars, (d) religious meetings, councils, etc. (33) Dynastic struggle inside the ruler's clan, murders of relatives (if any), usurpers of the throne, adversaries, etc. (34) Other fragments of the "personage's biography" will not be differentiated in such a detailed manner and will be collected in this item. We will call the information gathered here the "biographical remainder". It is convenient to measure it as a percentage of the whole "biography". Denote the listed items by EC-1, EC-2, ... , EC-34 (enquete-code, paragraph (1), (2), ... , etc.). The whole enquete-code (i.e., the above table) will be denoted by EC for short. Thus, each "written biography,, can be represented



60 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
as a certain formal table of EC, or "formal biography". Certain items in this table may be left blank, which occurs in the case where the corresponding information has been lost in the surviving documents.
4.13.2. If the parameter i ranges over the numbers of consecutive rulers in a
dynasty (dynastic stream) R1 , ... , ll,i, then the enquete-codes ECi of Ri can be regarded as the set of values of a certain new informative function. Since the set of enquete-codes of the rulers of a dynasty practically completely accumulates all the important information from that epoch, we can assume that the sequence, in fact, describes the epoch (A, B) in the history of the region. It is "covered" by the rulers of the given dynasty. Eventually, we can asso
ciate each historic epoch with a set of informative functions v = {/1 , / 2 , ... ,
EC-dynasties}, where Ji, / 2, ... are the informative functions already familiar to us, and the EC-dynasties are the enquete-code collection for the rulers "covering" (A, B). Since the rulers in one region sometimes reign simultaneously (and are then called co-rulers), different "dynastic jets" should be distinguished from the total dynastic stream, i.e., continuous (gap-free) subsequences of personages among whom there are no co-rulers or very few of them. Consider now the two epochs (A, B) and (C, D). Associate each with the
above set of informative functions, i.e., v = {Ji, / 2 , •.. , EC-dynasties} and
v' ={/L /~, .. . ,EC'-dynasties}.
4.14. A method of comparing the sets of informative functions for two historical epochs
4.14.1. Let us describe a method of comparing the sets of informative functions v and v' for two epochs. The comparison has been carried out in terms
of coordinates, i.e., the functions Ii and ff of the same kind are compared
to each other. For Ji, '2, ... , the coefficients of the above d-type were calculated. The comparison of the dynastic enquete-codes, i.e., the EC-dynasties and EC'-dynasties, is more complicated owing to a finer structure of these informative functions. Without going into details, we only discuss the comparison principle. We start with the comparison of rule durations. Let Ti, ... ,Tn and T{, ... , T~ be two sequences of dynastic rule durations in the epochs (A, B) and (C, D), respectively. We will measure the "distance" between them using
the coefficient A introduced in §5; see below. The coefficient A can be called "stream deviation coefficient" (SDC).
4.14.2. Thus, we compared the items of the enquete-codes EC-3 and EC'-3 of two rulers R and R'. The comparison of the remaining items will be done as follows. Let EC-1, ... , EC-34 be the enquete-code EC for the ruler R, and EC'-1, ... , EC'-34 the enquete-code EC' for R'. We introduce the numerical coefficients E1 , ... , E34 measuring the proximity (or remoteness) of the items EC-1 and EC'-1, ... , EC-34 and EC'-34. We have omitted here the times EC-3 and EC'-3, since they are compared already by means of the SDC. To



§4 Information Density in Texts 61
compare the items EC-j and EC'-j, we introduce the coefficients E-j. Then the following three situations are possible. (I) The biographical data compared are similar. For example, the items EC-5 and EC'-5 state that both rulers died a natural death, in which case we
put E-5 = +l.
(2) The biographical data compared are not explicitly coincident. For example, EC-5 states that a ruler died a natural death, and EC'-5 that he died
as the result of a conspiracy. We then put E-5 = -1. (3) The biographical data compared are neutral in the sense that they are consistent, but not identically coincident. For example, EC-5 states that a ruler "died" , whereas EC'-5 states that a ruler "was killed". We then put
E-5 == 0.
We now introduce the resultant coefficient E = E-1 + E-2 + E-4 + · · · + E-33. The coefficient E-3 is absent because the rule durations are compared by means of the SDC. Thus, the coefficient E measures the proximity of
the enquete-codes of the two rulers R and R'. Now, given two sequences of rulers {~} and {Ri}, we obtain a sequence of coefficients Ei comparing them.
Finally, we introduce the average coefficient Eav. = 1⁄4I:7= 1 Ei measuring
the proximity of the complete enquete-codes of the dynasties of {Ri} and {~}. Collecting this information, we might be able to estimate the remoteness or proximity of the enquete-codes of two dynasties and their corresponding epochs by means of the coefficients Eav. and the SDC.
4.15. A computational experiment
From 1978 to 1979, I performed a computational experiment, comparing several hundred pairs of epochs (A, B) and (C, D), i.e., sets of their informative
functions v = {Ii, /2, ... , EC of dynasties of rulers}. The time limits for the experiment were 3000 B.C. and A.O. 1800, with the events localized in Europe, the Mediterranean region, Egypt, and the Near East. In particular, the experiment showed that, in comparing the enquete-codes of some personages, we often had to put the coefficient E-j equal to zero, which occurred because the information compared there was consistent and, at the same time, unconfirmed. The role of+ 1 and -1 was therefore heightened. We discovered further that, in the overwhelming majority of concrete enquetecodes, the coefficient E-34 has to be made equal to zero, again because of the consistency of information compared. Recall that item EC-34 of an enquetecode is the personage's "bibliographical remainder". For a reliable comparison of the items EC-34 and EC'-34 in two biographies, we must be certain that we really possess sufficiently complete "written biographies" of the personages compared. However, to guarantee the completeness of the rulers' enquetecodes {all the more, of whole dynasties) is usually a complicated matter, due to which we have resorted to the following formal method. For each historical epoch, we have chosen a (possibly) uniform and sufficiently large historical text describing the events. We took either a fundamental monograph of the type of Gregorovius' work or a fundamental primary



62 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
source of Livy's type. Then item EC-34 of the enquete-code was identified with the "bibliographical remainder" for a historical character given in the historical work. For simplicity, the volume of item EC-34 was usually calculated as a percentage of the volume of the entire "biography" of the personage. Meanwhile, as a rule, we did not analyze the components of item EC-34. We illustrate this with an example. The epoch of regal Rome from 753 to 510 B.C. described by Livy (see [2]) turns out to be sufficiently close to that of the Roman Empire in A.D. 300-552, with the SDC being less than the lower bound for most of the SDC values for independent dynasties. Further, it turns out
for these epochs that Eav. = +19, and that the volume of item EC-34 equals 29%. In other words, about 29% of the "biographies" of historical characters in these epochs were "thrown overboard'' from the discussed parallels, it being important that this entire "biographical remainder" is zero for the coefficient of EC-34, which means that the information not involved in the parallel is noncontradictory within the framework of the comparison. It is useful to compare this result, which probably indicates the dependence of the epochs, with the numerical parameters found for an arbitrarily chosen pair of independent epochs. As an example of independent historical epochs, we take the following dynasties. (1) The dynasty of the Russian grand dukes from Igor (912-944) to Demetrius I (1275-1293). (2) The dynasty of the Byzantine emperors from Theodosius II (408-450) to Theophilus (829-842) (4]. Calculations show that the SDC is "very large";
further Eav. = -8.7. In this case, the volume of the "remainder" EC-34 is equal to 40%. This pair of dynasties is independent from the standpoint of the coefficients we introduced. A great difference is obvious between this and the example of the two dependent Roman Empires (see above). We shall now describe the results of the global computational experiment of comparing different epochs.
4.16. The remarkable decomposition of the global chronological diagram into the sum of four practically indistinguishable chronicles
4.16.1. The application of the above methods to the material of the GCD led to the discovery of isomorphic, parallel historical epochs in the history of Europe and the Mediterranean region (see Fig. 14). The sequence of figures forms a line in the diagram, schematically representing the history of ancient and medieval Europe. Identical geometric figures (denoted by the same letters) schematically represent historical epochs (or some parts of these epochs) which turn out to be formally isomorphic and parallel. Figure 15(1) represents the decomposition of the GCD into the sum of four practically indistinguishable chronicles. We can say that the GCD is decomposable into the sum of several shifts of the same chronicle. As it turns out, we can distinguish a shorter part in the GCD, which we call the chronicle

We then take another three copies of the same chronicle, each of which is shifted back on the time axis (i.e., from right to left) by 333 years, 1,053 years, and 1,778 years, respectively, after which all the shifted copies of C1 are glued to it and to each other, resulting in a longer GCD chronicle on which, therefore, parallel epochs duplicating each other appear.
4.16.2. We now give a short description of the GCD for Greece, Rome, and Germany. We shall move from left to right in Fig. 14 and list the historical epochs denoted by different geometric symbols. For a detailed description of all the dynastic jets for these cases, see Vol. 2 of this book.

(9) Restoration of the Roman Empire under Aurelian, and contemporary war in Italy (A .o. 270-300). (10) Roman Empire A.O. 300-535. Western and Eastern Empires. (11) Gothic War in the middle of the 6th century A.O. in Italy (535-552). {12) Medieval papal Rome from A.O. 553 to the middle of the 10th century. (13) Carolingian Empire, including the empire of Charlemagne 681-887. Wars of Charlemagne. (14) Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in the 10th to 13th century. The war in the middle of the 13th century; the fall of the dynasty of the Hohenstaufen (1250-1268). (15) Empire of the Habsburgs (1273-1619 or 1637). Besides, (10)-(13) also include the medieval dynastic branches of the Eastern Roman and Byzantine Empire. The parallels marked in Fig. 14 sometimes link all duplicate historical epochs, and sometimes only certain layers within these epochs. Certain epochs in the GCD can branch into several layers parallel to- other epochs.
4.16.3. Consider the epoch of ancient Rome from 753 B.C. to 230 B.C. and that of medieval Rome in from 300 to 820. Remember that these epochs are "parallel" in the sense that the coefficient d measuring the proximity of the local maxima of the volume function (for the primary sources describing these periods of history) is very small and equals 6 • 10-11 . This parallelism (overlapping) is confirmed by that of the enquete-codes which I found for the rulers' dynasties of these matching epochs. Moreover, I have discovered the parallelism of the events of the epoch of ancient Rome from 753 B.C. to A.O. 300 and that of medieval Rome from A.O. 300 to ea. 1353, which follows. The overlapping of parallel events occurs in shifting their dates by ea. 1,053 years. In other words, this rigid chronological shift can be written
as the formula T = X + 300 years, where Tare years A.O., and X the years from the foundation of the City (Rome). It is assumed traditionally that the year 1 since the foundation of Rome coincides with 753 B.c. In our forward shift, the "foundation of the city" falls in the year A.O. 300. I discovered this important "uniform forward shift" formula as a result of applying the enquete
code method and the method for the calculation of d. It turns out that Eav. =
+18 in the time interval from the year 1 to 250 since the foundation of Rome (when compared with the duplicate period A.O. 300-550). In the next time



66 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
interval, A.D. 550-820, the small value of the coefficient d calculated above for the duplicate epoch 250-520 since the foundation of Rome is consistent with the existence of a whole series of far-reaching parallelisms linking these two periods, i.e., the antique and medieval ones. An additional analysis of this overlapping (in the interval from A .D. 553 to 820) was then carried out by E.M. Nikishin. From 1978 to 1979, I also investigated the next time interval from the middle of the 9th to the 17th century (which overlaps with the period from 200 B.c. to A.O. 570) with the aid of the enquete-code method. The result is shown in the GCD in Fig. 14. For details, see Vol. 2.
4.16.4. As noted above, the concept of a text with a scale is more general than the examples of historical, narrative texts given above. For example, as a text X, we can take the collection of all the works of one author, as the parameter the numbers of pages (with consecutive pagination), and some quantitative characteristic of the text, for example, the average length of sentences, frequency of conjunctions, and so forth, as the informative function. The question arises whether there exist any conservation laws controlling the behaviour of such informative functions. It turns out that the answer is positive (see the author's paper "Authorial invariants in Russian literary texts of narrative sources" in Methods of Quantitative Analysis of Texts of Narrative Sources, History Institute of AN SSSR, Moscow, 1982, pp. 86-109; in Russian). We stress that the present chapter is only a brief survey of the theses, the detailed treatment of each of which is rather voluminous and requires an extensive machinery designed for lengthy statistical material.

§5 Chronology of Ancient Dynasties 67
§5. A Method of Duplicate Recognition and Some Applications to the Chronology of Ancient Dynasties1
5.1. The process of measuring random variables
Let a finite set of points D and a certain many-valued mapping V : D -+ R" which transforms D into a larger, but still finite set of points V(D) be given in the Euclidean space R". For example, V can model a multiple process of
measuring a certain random discrete variable etaking values in the set D. The many-valuedness can be caused by the nonuniqueness of the results of measuring due to the existence of random errors. Meanwhile, V(D) can be regarded as the set of values obtained by measuring the given random variable.
Note that each true value x of eturns into the set of points (values) V(x)
upon its measuring. It represents the original value x of the variable e. In
particular, each point of V(x) can be regarded as an approximate value of the true value x. In studying real processes of measuring random variables, the principal difficulty lies in correctly modelling, by means of the choice of a suitable mapping V, the mechanism of real measuring errors. Now, let the set D of the real values be unknown, and only the set V(D) of the "results of measuring" the desired random variable be known. How can we recognize those points of V(D) which correspond to the same point in the set D? The points (results of measuring) associated with the same real, true value will be called its duplicates, which, in turn, can naturally be called "original". Let the mapping V be such that the sets V(x) and V(y) are disjoint if the points x and y are different.
5.2. The distance between two random vectors
We introduce a certain natural measure ,\ of the distance between the points in the set V(D). We shall strive to make the points which belong to the same set V(x) (i.e., duplicates) sufficiently close in the sense of the measure ..\. On the contrary, points from different V(x) and V(y) should be distant in the sense of..\. Let a and b be two points in V(D). Fix a and construct its special neighbourhood Hr. We shall attempt to make the point a the centre of Hr, and let b lie on the boundary of the neighbourhood or close to it.
The simplest of such neighbourhoods is n; = {c E I/;& : lai - Ci I < lai
bil, 1 < i < n}. In other words, n: is simply a parallelepiped with its centre at
a and having bas one of its vertices, where a= (a1 , ... ,an), b = (b1, ... ,bn), For this simplest construction to become suitable in important applications, we have to extend it to model the mechanism of the random errors of interest, which influence the measurements of the true values of the variable {. We

68 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
construct such a neighbourhood Hr (a, b) below and thereby introduce the natural measure..\, permitting us to estimate the distance between two points a and b. As the basis for defining the measure, we shall take the procedure developed in §4. Namely,
..\( b) = vol Hr(a,b)
a, vol V(D) '
where vol V(D) is the number of points in the whole set V(D), and vol Hr(a, b) that from V(D) in the neighbourhood Hr(a, b).
5.3. Dynasties of rulers. The real dynasty and the numerical dynasty. Dependent and independent dynasties. The small-distortion principle
We shall now describe a concrete problem for whose solution we introduce the measure ..\. Let a historical text describing a previously unknown dynasty of rulers be discovered with an indication of the duration of their reigns. The question arises whether this historical dynasty is new and not mentioned in the known documents or whether it is one of the rulers' dynasties already known to us but described in a text in unusual terms (with the rulers' names distorted, etc.). Consider n consecutive authentic rulers (kings). Let the true rule durations of these kings be p1, P2, ... , Pn, respectively. We call this sequence a real dynasty. Note that the same real dynasty of rulers is often described in the primary sources from different standpoints by different chroniclers. But there exist more or less "invariant facts" concerning these rules, and their description depends little on the tastes of the author of a primary source (chronicler). Such facts include, for example, the duration of a king's rule, since there are usually no special reasons for which the chronicler should considerably and intentionally distort it. Nevertheless, chroniclers often encounter serious difficulties in calculating the regal rule duration, which leads to giving different values to the duration of the rule of the same historical character in different historical documents.
Thus, each author (chronicler), while describing a real dynasty p = (P1,P2,
... , Pn), calculates the duration a, of a king's rule and obtains a certain se
quence of numbers a =(a 1 , a 2 , •.• , an). This sequence of numbers represented
as an integral vector a in the space Rn will be called a numerical dynasty. Another chronicler, while describing the same real dynasty of kings, will possibly obtain another vector b from Rn, i.e., another numerical dynasty. Thus, one and the same real dynasty can be represented as different numerical dynasties in different documents. As the set D described in 5.1, we take a sufficiently large set of real dy
nasties of length n, i.e., D = {p = (p1, ••• , Pn)}. We formulate the following theoretical model (statistical hypothesis).



§5 Chronology of Ancient Dynasties 69
The small-distortion principle. If two numerical dynasties are sufficiently
close (in the sense of the measure >..)1 then they indeed represent the same real dynasty of kings, i.e., they are merely two different versions of its description. Such numerical dynasties will be called dependent. On the contrary, if two numerical dynasties represent two real dynasties of kings, known a priori as different, then the numerical dynasties are much different from one another (in the sense of the measure >..). Such numerical dynasties will be called independent.
Later in Section 5.4, before verifying this model experimentally, we shall give an exact description of the measure A. Meanwhile, we identify the set of all numerical dynasties describing real historical dynasties from the set D in the space Rn (see above) with the set V(D).
5.4. Basic errors leading to controversy among chroniclers as to the duration of kings' rules
We now point out concrete errors most often leading to the controversy among chroniclers as to the duration of the rules of kings. (a) Permutation of the names of (or confusion between} two neighbouring rulers. (b) Replacing two neighbouring rulers by one, the duration of whose rule was assumed to be equal to the sum of the rule durations of both. (c) Computational error by a chronicler. The longer the duration of a king's rule, the greater the error that arises in its computation. It turns out that these three basic types of concrete errors made by chroniclers can be sufficiently simply described by means of a suitable mapping, V : D ---+ Rn. Let p be a certain real dynasty in the set D. We call the dynasty (vector) c a virtual variation (virtual vector) of the dynasty p and write
c = v(p) if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely, each coordinate Ci of c coincides with one of the three coordinates of the original vector p, i.e.,
Pi-1, Pi, Pi+l, or with Pi+ Pi+l.
It is clear that each of such virtual vectors, or virtual dynasties, can be regarded as a numerical dynasty and be obtained from a real dynasty p, because of chroniclers' errors of type (a) and (b). Eventually, we take as V(D) the union of all virtual vectors (virtual dynas
ties) c = v(p), where p ranges over all the real dynasties of D. It remains to model an error of type (c). Let a piecewise smooth, nonnegative function a-(t) be given on the positive
half-axis t > 0. In our case, the role of a-(t) will be played by the probability
density of a random variable 1J to be specified below. Put h(t) = f(a(t)), where f(s) is a certain monotonically decreasing function of a parameter s,
given on the half-axis s > 0, and such that limf(s) = +oo when s ---+ +0. For example, as f(s), we can take the function ; . If 1J is a discrete random variable with probability density o(t), then the quantity h(t) becomes greater as 1J assumes the value t with lesser probability. In our problem, we take as TJ the duration of a king's rule in a dynasty. Let t range over all positive integers



70 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
(i.e., possible values of the rule duration). If t is a certain fixed rule duration, or the value of T/, then o(t) will mean the number of historical characters ruling fort years (see Fig. 12). We call h(t) the error amplitude in measuring a rule t years long. The graph o(t) in Fig. 12 shows that short rules are most frequent, and, conversely, long rules are rare.
5.5. The experimental frequency histogram for the duration of the rules of kings
§4 showed the experimental frequency histogram I obtained for the rule durations of authentic kings (Fig. 12). If t is the value (rule duration) taken by the random variable '1 with large probability, then the amplitude of chroniclers' errors h(t) decreases. In other words, the values of short rule durations of frequently mentioned kings have been calculated by the chroniclers better than long ones, which are rarely encountered. We now indicate the error function h(t) of chroniclers, which we calculated for the probability density of the random variable, namely the "rule duration" (see §4). Break the interval from zero to 100 on the integral axis t into smaller seg
ments of the form {10k, 10k + 9), where k = 0, 1, ... , 9. Then the amplitude
h(t) of the chroniclers' error has the following form, namely,
l
2 h(t) = 3
5([ 1'ol - 1)
when 0 < t < 20 when 20 < t < 30
when 30 < t < 100.
5.6. Virtual dynasties and a mathematical model for errors made by the chronicler in measuring the rule duration
Consider a rectangular parallelepiped Il(a, b) in the space R;l and denote it
simply by Il. Its orthogonal projections 'Tri = a,± (lai - bil + h(ai)) onto the
coordinate axes in the space nn will be given by intervals with the following endpoints, namely,
if O< Oi < 20
if 20 < ai < 30
if 30 < ai < 100,
where [y] denotes the integral part of the number y. Thus, if 0 < ai < 20, then
the rule duration a,, and also bi, of two kings numbered i in the dynasties compared, is considered by us only approximately, to the accuracy of ±1 year. In other words, this is an error of the chronicler, made in measuring the rule
duration. If 20 < ai < 30, then the chronicler's error is already equal to ±1.5 years, and so forth. We now fix two dynasties a and b. It remains to model the fact that the assignment of a point (dynasty) c
from the set of virtual dynasties V(D) to the parallelepiped Il can be considered only approximately, with some allowance. Hence, we have to make the



§5 Chronology of Ancient Dynasties 71
boundary of II less distinct. Let r be a certain fixed number. Consider a real dynasty p from the set D. Assume that at least r coordinates Pi of this vector p, i.e., r values for the rule duration, have fallen onto the projections 1ri of II.
We assume, in addition, that a certain virtual dynasty c = v(p) of p has fallen entirely into II. We say that such vectors (dynasties) p from D are r-close to the parallelepiped II determined by the two fixed dynasties a and b. Eventually, we define the neighbourhood Hr(a,b) of a by considering the union of II and all the virtual variations of dynasties (vectors) p from the set D, which happened to be r-close to II (see Fig. 15(2)).

Figure 15{2). Parallelepiped determined by the two fixed dynasties M and N.
As a proximity measure for two dynasties a and b, we take the ratio of the number of dynasties (vectors) of the set V(D), which are in the neighbourhood Hr(a, b), to the total number of dynasties (vectors) in the set V(D). In counting the number of dynasties in Hr(a,b), we do not count the virtual variations of a and b, which are different from them. The constructed number A has an important probabilistic interpretation. Indeed, construct the function </> of the probability density for the random vector from the set V(D) of all virtual dynasties, with the vector ranging over the dynasties. We divide the space R" into standard cubes of sufficiently small size, so that no point of V(D) has fallen onto any of their boundaries. If x is an interior point of some cube, then we take the following value as </>(x), namely,
</>(x) = number of points of the set V(D) in this cube . total number of points in the set V(D)



72 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
However, if x is on the boundary of the cube, then we put 4,(x) = 0. It is clear that the above measure A(a,b) is the integral of 4, with respect to the set Hr(a,b), provided that Hr(a,b) consists of the cubes of our partition. Since we model here approximate calculations of the chroniclers, we can assume that this condition is fulfilled (if the cubes are sufficiently small). Finally, the number A( a, b) can now be regarded as the probability of the fact that the random vector distributed in the space Rn with the density function 4> has fallen into the neighbourhood Hr with its centre at a point
(dynasty) a and the "radius" lb - al+ h(a).
5.7. The small-distortion principle and a computer experiment
To verify the theoretical model of Section 5.3 (the small distortion principle), the chronological tables of J. Blair [1] and F. Ginzel [2] were used; they contain practically all the basic chronological data that survived for real historical
dynasties. I have made a complete list of all dynasties of length n = 15 from the history of Europe, the Mediterranean region, the Near East, and Egypt from 4000 B.C. to A.D. 1800. The data have then been supplemented by information from 14 other chronological tables. The obtained list D turned out to represent certain real kings by several different numerical dynasties (due to the difference in the chroniclers' opinion). We now indicate the basic historical dynasties included in D. Bishops and popes in Rome, Saracens, high priests in Judaea, Greeks in Bactria, exarchs in Ravenna, all dynasties of Pharaohs and other Egyptian rulers, dynasties of the Byzantine Empire, Roman Empire, Spain, Russia, France, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, Scotland, Lacedaemon (Sparta), Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Israel, Babylonia, Syria, Sicyon, Judaea, Portugal, Parthia, the Bosphorus, Macedonia, Poland, and England. The total number of dynasties making up the virtual set V(D) in the space R15 turned out to be approximately equal to 15 • 1011 . If, for some pair of virtual dynasties a and b, the number .-\(a, b) is sufficiently small, then the observable proximity of the dynasties a and b is a rare event; the rarer it is, the less is the coefficient .-\(a, b). As r in the numerical experiment, we have
taken 11 equal to 1 + ~n by the "two-thirds" rule. The author then performed an extensive computational experiment to de
termine A(a, b) for different pairs of dynasties a and b. The result fully confirmed the model of Section 5.3. Namely, the coefficient ~(a, b) turned out to oscillate for surely dependent numerical dynasties in the interval from 10-12 to 10-8 • If, on the contrary, the numerical dynasties a and b are surely independent, then the coefficient A(a, b) was not less than 10-3 • The great (5th-order) difference between surely dependent and surely independent dynasties is manifest. The remaining ones make up a small percentage of the total number of dynasties.
Obviously, the above result permits us to solve the problem of distinguishing dependent numerical dynasties.



§5 Chronology of Ancient Dynasties 73
5.8. Pairs of dependent historical dynasties previously regarded as independent
Our experiment has discovered several special pairs of historical dynasties a and b which previously had been regarded as independent in all senses; however, the value of the coefficient ..\(a, b) for them is the same as for pairs of surely dependent dynasties. There are only several dozen such special pairs among the 106 of dynastic pairs studied. We shall illustrate this with some examples. (1) The Roman Empire from 82 B.C. to A.O. 217 and the Roman Empire
from 270 to 526, where ,\ = 1.3 • 10- 12 . (2) The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation from 962 to 1254 and the Habsburgs Empire from 1273 to 1619, where..\= 1.2 • 10- 12 . (3) The Roman Empire from 270 to 553 (see example 1) and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (see example 2) from 962 to 1254,
where ..\ = 2.3 • 10- 10 • (4) The Carolingians, the empire of Charlemagne from 681 to 887 and the
Eastern Roman Empire from 333 to 527, where ,\ = 8.25 • 10-9 •
5.9. The distribution of dependent dynasties in the "modern textbook" of ancient history
All the above results have been analyzed in the following manner. I have constructed the GCD for all the historical dynasties described in Section 5.7 (see also §4 and [3]), for which the rule duration periods for all the rulers of the indicated dynasties from list D and the dates of all basic events occurring in the time interval from 4000 B.C. to A.O. 1800 were marked off on the horizontal time axis (as horizontal intervals of different length). The GCD was then subjected to the procedure of discovering duplicates, or dependent epochs. All the discovered historical dynastic pairs a and b, and the corresponding historical epochs, for which the coefficient ..\(a, b) turned out to be anomalously small, of the order from 10- 12 to 10-8 , were marked on the GCD. We will call such dynasties (and also the epochs) duplicates. Recall that the theoretical model of Section 5.3 has been confirmed by the results of the experiment performed, from which it follows that the anomalous small value of ,\(a, b) most probably indicates the dependence of the historical dynasties and their corresponding epochs. We now describe the portion E of the GCD in the time interval from 1600 B.C. to A.O. 1800. We represent the result as a schematic line E made up of consecutive letters indicating on the time axis different dynasties and the corresponding epochs. Duplicate epochs will be represented by identical letters. Because of the enormousness of the data, we give here only a rough sketch of the GCD (for details, see Vol. 2 of this book). The letters in the numerator and denominator of a fraction represent simultaneous epochs. Thus, the epoch E has the form:



74 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2

p C p nn C

Cp
p
1600 B.C. 753 B.C. 82 B .C. A.O. 250 A.O. 962 A.O. 1619
It is obvious that E contains a repetition, duplicating each other's epochs. Besides, it decomposes into the sum of four almost identical copies of shorter
chronicle lines (see Fig. 9). We can schematically write that E = C1 + C2 +
C3 + C4. Line C1 is obtained by gluing the chronicles Co and C' together. Thus, all four chronicle lines C1, C2 , Ca, and C4 are practically identical, being only different in their position on the time axis.
5.10. Dependent dynasties in the Bible and parallel with European history
· There are also other pieces (chronicles) in the GCD containing duplicates. Consider an example: the chronicle line B embracing the events from 4000 to 586 B.c., described in the Old Testament. We borrowed their chronology from Blair's traditional tables (Tables 1-7 in [1]; more precisely, see the data from Columns 1 and 2 of Tables 1, 2, and 3; Columns 1, 2, and 3 of Table 4; Columns 1 and 2 of Table 5; Column 1 of Table 6; and finally, Column 3 of Table 7). The historical events making up the chronicle line B have been described in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, the Book of Joshua, the Book of Judges, the Book of Ruth, the First Book of Samuel, the Second Book of Samuel, the First Book of the Kings, the Second Book of the Kings, the First Book of Chronicles, the Second Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra, the Book of Nehemiah, and the Book of Esther. Traditionally, these events are believed to have occurred in the Near East, i.e., in a region different from that determined by the events composing the chronicle line E (Europe, the Mediterranean region; see above). The application of our method for duplicate recognition and those methods described in §4 lead to the discovery of duplicates in B, which are distributed as follows (for details, see Vol. 2).

where the epoch Ca is part of C. It is not accidental that we have employed the same symbols in describing the biblical chronicle B as for the European chronicle E. We see that B coincides with a certain part of E, i.e., overlaps it (there is parallelism of events). Namely, the following equality is valid:

The length of B equals ea. 2,300 years. Thus, the complete "textbook of modern history", i.e., the GCD, contains not only shortened redated chronicles of the forms E and B, but also parallel, or isomorphic, i.e., nearly coincident chronicles of considerable length. Meanwhile, they are traditionally treated today as chronicles describing different historical epochs. The following general result is valid. The whole GCD, and not only the above chronicles E and B, can he completely restored from its lesser part Co describing the events placed to the right of A.O. 300, it being important that most of the events in Co are placed, in reality, even to the right of A.O. 960. In particular, the chronicle B can be practically completely restored from its lesser part which describes the events from A .o. 960 to 1400.

§6. A New Empirico-Statistical Procedure for Text Ordering and Its Applications to the Problems of Dating1
6.1. The chapter generation
This section presents one of the new methods for dating ancient events worked out on the basis of statistical principles which I initially formulated and verified in [1] and which I presented at the Third International Vilnius Conference on Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics. The goal of the method discussed in this section is to find a chronologically correct order of separate fragments of historical texts and to discover among them various duplicates, or repetitions, i.e., parts describing the same events. We call the fragment of a historical text describing the events of (approximately) one generation a chapter generation (or simply chapter). Let a historical text X embrace the events in a sufficiently large time interval (A, B), i.e., from a year A to a year B. Assume that this text is broken (or can be broken) into separate chapters X(T), where T denotes the number of a generation (historical characters) described in a fragment of the text X(T). Meanwhile, we assume that numbering of the chapters X (T) is determined by their order in the text X. The obvious question arises: Have these chapters been ordered chronologically correctly by the author? If, however, the correct (chronological) numeration of the chapters has been lost (is unknown or doubtful), how can it be restored? In other words, how can the events described in the chapters X(T) be ordered chronologically correctly in time?
6.2. The frequency-damping principle
Let a time interval (A, B) described in a text be sufficiently large, i.e., tens of hundreds of years long. Then, as I discovered while quantitatively processing the information contained in a large set of concrete historical texts, the following important circumstance should be taken into account. It turns out that in the overwhelming majority of cases, different historical characters bear different full names in the text. This can be explained easily, though. As a matter of fact, a chronicler is interested in distinguishing between different historical characters in order to avoid any ambiguity. The simplest method to achieve this is to give different full names to different characters. The fact can be justified by checking experimentally. We now formulate the theoretical frequency-damping principle.
In the chronologically correct ordering of chapter generations of a text X, the author changes historical characters while proceeding from the description of the events of one generation to those of the subsequent one. Namely, when describing those generations prior to a fixed one numbered To for a given ordering of chapters, the chronicler mentions no characters of To. With

§6 Text Ordering and Problems of Dating 77
a chronologically correct ordering of chapters, this can be explained by the simple fact that these personages have not yet been born. Then, when describing To, the chronicler speaks of the historical characters of this generation most often in chapter X(T0 ). This is quite understandable, for the historical events described by the author are related to the personages born at that time. Finally, proceeding with the description of subsequent generations, the chronicler mentions the characters preceding the generation To less and less, which is also natural, because the author describes the new historical events of subsequent centuries whose personages certainly overshadow the deceased characters and the memories of them. Since, due to the above remark, we can assume that the "identity" name= historical character is valid (see above), we shall now investigate the totality of all full names of personages mentioned in a text under investigation. As a rule, the term "full" will be omitted. Consider the set of the names of personages first appearing, for a given ordering of chapters, in a chapter T0 of a text X. Denoting the number of mentions of all the names in the chapter X(To) by K(To, To), we count each name with its multiplicity and calculate the frequency of its being mentioned. We then see how many times these names have been mentioned in a chapter X(T) and obtain a certain number K(To, T). We stress once again that if a certain name is encountered several times, then all these references are taken into account. Thus, for each number To, we obtain a certain numerical graph K(T0 , T), where the argument T is variable. We can now reformulate the frequency-damping principle as follows.
In numbering the chapters chronologically correctly (i.e., chapters describing the same events), with duplicates being absent among them, each graph of
l((To, T) must have the following (theoretical) form. The function K(T0 , T) vanishes to the right of the point To while reaching its absolute maximum at the point To itself and decreasing monotonically to the right of To (Fig. 16). The experimental check has completely confirmed (on the average) this frequency-damping principle for several dozen historical texts with a prescribed chronologically correct ordering of chapters (see [5]).
6.3. The method of finding the chronologically correct order of chapters in a historical chronicle
We now describe the method of finding the chronologically correct order of chapters in a historical text X (or in a whole set of texts). Number all the chapters of the text X in a certain order, e.g., in which they occur in the text itself. We then determine the graph of /((To, T) described above for each separate chapter X(To). The number of these graphs will equal that of the chapters in the text X. All these values K(To, T) (for the variables To and T) are naturally organized into a square matrix K {T} of order n x n, where n is the total number of chapters in the text. In the ideal (theoretical) case, the matrix K {T} has the form shown in



78 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2

Figure 16. The frequency-damping principle {for the case of chronologically correct ordering of chapters in the chronicle).
Fig. 16a. Namely, all the absolute maxima (lines and columns of the matrix) are concentrated on the principal diagonal. Then, the farther off the principal diagonal, the smaller (monotonically) the values K(To, T). The computational experiment has shown for real historical texts that, with a chronologically correct ordering of the chapters in a text X, the numbers K(T0 , T) decrease, on the average, monotonically not only with respect to the rows of the matrix I( {T} but also to its columns (see Fig. 16b). In other words, the frequency of names (personages) of prior origin, i.e., from the earlier chapters X(T) mentioned in the fragment X(To), gradually decreases as the generation T creating them moves farther away from the generation T0 under investigation. It thus turned out that an increase in the age of a historical character (name) almost always causes a decrease in the frequency of references to this personage (name) in the subsequent chapters X(To). To estimate the rate and character of the frequency-damping graph for the references to a name, we can make use of the following averaged graph,



§6 Text Ordering and Problems of Dating 79
namely,
K (t) = Ei-To=t K(To, i)
av. t ,
n
where t = 0, 1, 2, ... , n - 1.
It is clear that it is obtained by averaging the square matrix K {T} with respect to all diagonals parallel to the principal. Certainly, the experimental graphs K (To, T) may turn out not to be coincident with the theoretical graph for a concrete text. It is obvious that, upon varying the original numbering of chapters X(T), the matrix K {T} and its entries also vary. As a matter of fact, there occurs a rather complicated redistribution of the names first appearing in a certain chapter X(T0). Let us change the order of chapters of the text X by means of various permutations, which we denote by u. We also designate the new chapter numeration corresponding to a permutation <T performed by uT. While calculating the new matrix K {uT} for each of these chapter permutations, we will seek u, i.e., an order <T of the text chapters, such that all or almost all frequency graphs of references to the names K (To, T) will have the almost theoretical form shown in Fig. 16. In particular, we will try to make the graph Kav.(t) maximally close to the ideal, monotonically damping graph in Fig. 16. The order of the textual chapters, for which the deviation of the experimental matrix from the theoretical (damping) is the least, should be taken as chronologically correct and required. This method of chapter ordering permits us to date ancient events. In fact, let a certain historical text Y be given for which it is only known that it describes some events from a historical epoch (A, B).Assume that we already have another dated text X describing the same epoch more or less completely. Let X be separated into the chapter generations X(T). How can we learn
which generation exactly has been described in the text Y in question? We shall make use of the text X. Add Y to the collection of chapters X(T) of X, for which it suffices to assume that Y is a new chapter of X, and ascribe a certain number T0 to it, i.e., insert the chapter Yin place of T0 in the text X. Then, employing the above method, we find the optimal, i.e., chronologically correct order of all the chapters of the text X with the chapter Y added. Meanwhile, we shall therefore also find a chronologically correct place for the new chapter Y. The relative position which the text Y will occupy among other chapters of X should evidently be taken as the one desired. We thereby date the ancient events described in Y relative to the chapters of the text X. This dating method has been checked against historical texts with an a priori known dating of the events described. The efficiency of the method has been fully confirmed (see (51).
6.4. The frequency-duplicating principle and the method of duplicate recognition
We now account for a new method of duplicate recognition in a text and describe the frequency-duplicating principle. Let a historical epoch (A, B) be



80 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
described in some text X which is divided into individual chapters X (T). Assuming that they have been numbered generally in a chronologically correct manner, we suppose that there are two duplicates among the chapters, i.e., two chapters or fragments of the text, describing the events of one and the same generation. In other words, these chapters repeat each other, but are placed by the chronicler in different locations in the text X. Consider the simplest situation where the same chapter is repeated in X twice, numbered To as a chapter X(To) and Co as a chapter X(Co), We take To < Co.

Figure 17. A new method of duplicate recognition (frequency-duplication principle).
It is evident that the frequency graphs K(To, T) and K(Co, T) have the form represented in Fig. 17. The first graph K(To, T) clearly does not satisfy the frequency-damping principle (two maxima). Hence, we have to permute the chapters of the text somehow to achieve better agreement with the theoretical damping graph in Fig. 16. Furthermore, we can see that the second
graph vanishes, i.e., K(Co, T) = 0, which is explained by the fact that there are no new names appearing in the chapter X (Co) for the first time (they all have already appeared in the earlier chapter X(T0 )). It then becomes evident that the best coincidence of the experimental frequency graph with the theoretical one in Fig. 17 is achieved when we juxtapose these two duplicates (i.e., chapters X(To) and X(C0)) or simply identify them. Thus, if the chapters of the text, which in general are numbered chronologically correctly, contain two whose frequency graphs have the form approximately represented in Fig. 17, then they are probably duplicates and should be identified. This is exactly what we call the frequency-duplicating principle. A similar reasoning is also valid for the case of several duplicates in a text.



§6 Text Ordering and Problems of Dating 81
In the experiment which I performed, the discovery of such double peaks of the frequency graph (which correspond to the duplicates) occurred as follows. Let ai; be an element of the matrix K {T}, placed in the ith row and the jth column. Consider the matrix {a0 /J} consisting of the elements a0 (J, where
a > i and /3 < j, i.e., part of the large matrix K {T} bounded by the ith row and the jth column. We construct the averaged frequency graph K~t_(t) for it by averaging the values positioned in the matrix {aa/J} on the diagonals parallel to the principal one. We now assume that the ith and the jth columns of the frequency matrix I( {T} correspond to two duplicates X(i) and X(j),
i.e., T = i or T = j. Then the averaged frequency graph of I<!((t) has the
form represented in Fig. 17, i.e., it possesses two maxima. Then, by marking all those elements ai; (where i < j) in the large matrix
I< {T} for which the averaged graph of K!!v.(t) has such an anomalous form, we discover th~e chapters which may be duplicates. It was required in concrete
computations that the averaged graph of I<~i.(t), where p = i+s and q = j-s, on the average should be monotonically decreasing if the positive integer s is sufficiently small compared to the difference j - i. For a more detailed statistical analysis, see Vol. 2.
6.5. The distribution of old and new duplicates in the Old and New Testament. A striking example: the Book of Revelation
For many an ancient historical text, commentators have performed the job of discovering repeating fragments, or duplicates. By a repetition (variant of a duplicate), we may understand not only a repetition of names (see above) but, more generally, the repeated description of some event in the text, and so forth. For example, in the Old and New Testament, all such individual repetitions (duplicates) discovered by the commentators have been indicated and collected in the so-called set of parallel passages. This list counts about 20,000 verses in the Old and New Testament. If some historical text X is supplied with the same (or similar) set indicating duplicates, then, for their correct chronological ordering, we can apply our method from Section 6.4. Meanwhile, we have to regard the repeating fragments of the text as repeating "names". The method of text ordering and duplicate recognition is also applicable to the list of reciprocal citations in any closed collection of historical and other texts. In particular, I have applied all these methods to the Old and New Testament, which resulted in the discovery of new and previously unknown duplicates in addition to those known previously, such as the First and Second Book of Samuel, the First and Second Book of Kings, and the First and Second Book of Chronicles. The distribution of these duplicates in the sequence of the books of the Old and New Testament is represented in Fig. 18 by the line B, where all the discovered duplicates are denoted by identical letters. It turned out, in particular, that the traditionally accepted order of chapter generations, and therefore books, of the Old and New Testament differs sharply from the one chronologically correct in the above sense, which has

§6 Text Ordering and Problems of Dating 83
principle in that and only that case where the separate chapters and books of the Old Testament are mixed up and permuted in a definite and rather intricate manner with those of the New Testament. Roughly speaking, the books of the Old and New Testament can be shifted toward each other. Meanwhile, it is important that in about 88% of the cases, the mutual position of chapters and books is retained inside the shifted fragments. A striking example can be given by the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, traditionally placed last in the Canon. If this traditional position were chronologically correct, then its frequency graph K(T, To) (constructed from the frequency matrix column) would have to be of the form represented by the dotted line in Fig. 19.

Figure 19. Strong disagreement between the real frequency graph for the Book of Revelation {solid line) and the theoretical frequency graph (dotted line).
However, the real frequency graph for the Book of Revelation (see Fig. 19), given by a continuous line, is sharply different from the theoretical one. Hence, to eliminate this discrepancy and to restore the correct chronological order, we should place the Book of Revelation near the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah, the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, Exodus and Leviticus (with the new ordering discovered by our method).
6.6. Duplicates of epochs in the "modern textbook" of ancient history
The same method has also been applied by the author to the written sources of ancient and medieval Europe, due to which all the duplicate-epochs schematically represented in Fig. 18 along line E (European history) by identical letters have been discovered. All these results are consistent with the decomposition of the GCD (see §5) into the sum of four chronicles, which I discovered on the basis of quite different statistical dating methods (see §4, §5, and [2]-[51). Line E in Fig. 18 schematically represents European history and chronology (the sequence of events with their traditional dating), while line B shows the



84 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
history described in the Old and New Testament (see §5). The overlapping (parallelism) of the historical epochs described in the Old and New Testament and those entered along line E is represented in the listing given below. The events (epochs) designated in this list by identical letters are, wholly or partly, duplicates, or fibre into the sum of several duplicates. Thus, we consecutively describe the basic events making up line E which, as noted above, in reality includes also the duplicate events from line B marked
by the "=" sign. Thus, this is the table of possible parallelisms, where "-" means "duplicate".

= The First Book of Kings 12-22, the Second Book of Kings 1-23, the Second Book of Chronicles 10-34, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
We now interrupt our listing of the events represented by lines E and B and stress the agreement of the overlapping of the dynasties indicated in item (P/C) and the results of another method of dynastic overlapping (see §5). Namely, according to these results, the dynasty of the ancient kings of J udaea and that of the medieval rulers of the Holy Roman Empire from 911 to 1307 (note that we take into account the German coronation dates for the Holy Roman emperors) are parallel to each other (overlap) with proximity coefficient 10- 12 , which indicates their interdependence (see the definition of the proximity coefficient A in §5). Besides, the dynasty of Israel's ancient kings and the medieval dynasty composed of the dates of the Roman coronations (and also of the rule durations) of the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire from 920 to 1170 are also parallel to each other (overlap) with proximity coefficient 10-s. In both cases, overlapping indicates the dependence of these dynastic pairs in the sense of §5. In the block of historical events (P/C) which we are now discussing, the following overlapping occurs. Gregory VII Hildebrand (10201053-1073-1085) is parallel to Jesus (Gk. iesiis). This overlapping results from shifting the dates by 1,052 years. For details, see Vol. 2.



86 New Statistical Methods for Dating Chapter 2
The chronicle lines E and B then contain the following events.
(T) = The war in the middle of the 13th century in Italy, the fall of the German dynasty of the Hohenstaufen, establishment of the House of Anjou; Conrad, Manfred, Charles of Anjou, Conradin, 1252-1268. = The Second Book of Kings 24-25, the Second Book of Chronicles 35-36, the war with the Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar, the fall of Judaea, the start of Babylonian (Avignon) captivity.
(C) = The Holy Roman Empire of the Habsburgs, 1273-1619, 70-year Avi
gnon exile of the popes and pontificate from 1305 to 1376, the pontiffs' return from France to Italy. The traditional chronology of ancient history is created at the same time by J. Scaliger (1540-1609) and Dionysius Petavius (15831652). It is possible that Dionysius Exiguus (6th century) is the duplicate, i.e., the reflection, of Dionysius Petavius (16th century).
(Ca)= a part of (C) and the duplicate is as follows: The Book of Ezra, the Book of Nehemiah, the Book of Esther (which, taken all together, probably describe the period from 1305 to 1378), the Babylonian captivity lasts for 70 years, return to Jerusalem.
Thus, the entire GCD (§5) is practically completely restorable from its lesser parts describing the events only from A.O. 900 to 1650, which is done by shifting the indicated shorter chronicle backward by ea. 333, 720, 1,053, and 1,778 years (§5, and Fig. 18 of the present section). For example, the chronological shift backward by 1,053 years (ea. 1,000 years) could have arisen when the chronologists later compared two different methods of counting and fixing dates. (a) By the first method, the dates could have been written as follows, for example: 13th century A.O.= X.III = Christ 3rd century= christos-III, which might have indicated the 3rd century since the 11th century A.O., i.e., the 3rd century since the birth of Gregory VII Hildebrand (cf. also the canonical names of centuries in Italy: trecento, i.e., three hundred, the 14th century A.O.; quattrocento, i.e., four hundred, the 15th century A.O.) Similarly, the dates
could have also been written thus: A.O. 1500 = 1.500 = Jesus the year 500 =
iesus-500, which might have indicated the 500th year since the beginning of the 11th century A.O., i.e., since the birth of Gregory VII Hildebrand. (b) Finally, the second method of counting dates, namely, the years A.O.: It is possible that the letters X and I were originally supplied by the chroniclers not with a numerical value (one thousand), but with a meaningful one, i.e., they were abbreviations of the names "Christ" and "Jesus" (see above). In conclusion, we make an addendum to the list of special pairs of dependent historical dynasties (see §5). (1) The dynasty of the popes (pontifices) from A.O. 140 to 314 and that of
the Roman popes from A.O. 324 to 532, where A = 8.66 · 10-s. (2) The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation from A.O. 936 to 1273 and the ancient Roman Empire from 82 e.c. to A.O. 217, where A= 1.3-10- 12 .

CHAPTER3
NEW EXPERIMENTAL AND STATISTICAL
METHODS FOR DATING EVENTS OF ANCIENT
HISTORY, AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
TO THE GLOBAL CHRONOLOGY OF
ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL HISTORY1
This is a brief review of my book Global Chronology of the Ancient and Medieval World: An Experiment in Statistical Research. Methods and Applications, containing an account of the results I obtained from 1974 to 1982. The manuscript is about 6,000 typed pages long, and hence, due to the limited space, the present chapter is only meant to give the reader an idea of the essence of the problem, namely, the new methods for dating ancient events and the construction of the global chronological diagram, a "modern textbook" for ancient and medieval history, and its decomposition into the sum of three shifts of four identical chronicles. I do not pretend to explain completely the problems of purely historical character. My hypothesis touching upon problems of history may turn out not to be final but, possibly, require further investigation.
§7. Introduction. N .A. Morozov and Modern Results
The first detailed investigation of today's problem to substantiate chronology was carried out by N.A. Morozov, who, between 1924 and 1932, published the fundamental work Christ [1], in which he gave a detailed criticism of the traditional chronology of the ancient world. The important fact discovered in this work is the remaining absence of any substantiation of the accepted concepts which form the basis for the traditional chronology of ancient times. Proceeding from the analysis of a large number offacts, Morozov proposed and

partly substantiated his fundamental hypothesis that "traditional" ancient history had been artificially extended in comparison with "real" events. Nikolai Aleksandrovich Morozov (1854-1946) is a remarkable universalist scholar, a well-known Russian scientist, revolutionary, and public figure (for details, see Nikolai Aleksandrovich Morozov: A Universalist Scholar. Nauka, Moscow, 1982 (in Russian); V.A. Tvardovskaya, N.A. Morozov in the Russian Liberation Movement. Nauka, Moscow, 1983 (in Russian); "Nikolai Aleksandrovich Morozov" in Bibliography of Scientists of the USSR, Nauka, Moscow, 1981; in Russian). In 1881, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his political activity as a member of the revolutionary movement of the Populists. While in prison, he educated himself in chemistry, physics, astronomy, mathematics, and history. After his release, he engaged in scientific activities and was appointed to a professorship. After the October Revolution, Morozov took over as director of the Lesgaft Institute of Natural Sciences. This institute was totally reformed after Morozov left the post of director. In 1922, he was elected an honorary member of the USSR Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. From 1924 to 1932, Morozov published his work Christ [1] (the original title was The History of Human Culture from the Standpoint of the Natural Sciences), which stirred up an animated discussion in the press [33], [34], [35]. Although raising certain serious objections, the critical part of [1] as a whole was not disputed. In 1974, Prof. M.M. Postnikov read four lectures at Moscow State University, in which he gave a brief survey of Morozov's aforementioned work and thereby drew my attention to the problem of substantiating ancient chronology. Here, I briefly substantiate the new results I obtained from 1974 to 1982 on the basis of my new methods of dating ancient events. These methods and certain applications to chronology were published in the scientific papers listed in the Bibliography.
§8. Problems of Historical Chronology
8.1. Roman chronology as the "spinal column" of European chronology
First, we shall give a short review of the present state of the chronology of ancient events. Being an important historical tool, chronology permits us to determine the time interval between any historical fact and the present if we translate the units of the chronological data of a document describing this fact into those of our calendar system, i.e., dates B.C. or A.O. Many historical conclusions depend on the dates which are events described in a source under investigation. On changing the dates (e.g., if they are not uniquely determined), treatment and estimation of the events are also altered. Present global chronology has been formed as a result of research by several generations of chronologists of the 16th-19th century. Accordingly, all important ancient events were assigned Julian dates. The facts described in any



90 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
recently found old documents are now dated according to a procedure which we shall illustrate by the following example. Suppose a Roman consul had been mentioned in some Roman text. Since the complete list of Roman consuls ranges over a period of more than 1050 years, from Lucius Junius, son of Marcus Brutus, and Tarquinius Superbus (509 B.c.) to Basil I (A.D. 541) [20), we can adjust the described events to the time scale by finding the appropriate consul's name and by referring to the dates which his consulate has according to the list. This example is typical in the sense that most modern dating methods are based on the comparison of data in a document with those whose dating had been established earlier and is regarded as known and fixed. The above example was deliberately chosen from Roman chronology. As a matter of fact, "all the remaining dates in ancient chronology can be related to our calendar system by means of direct or indirect synchronizations with the Roman ones" ([7), p. 77). In other words, Roman chronology and history is the "spinal column" of the entire global chronology and history, and it is because of this fact that in the following we pay special attention to Roman history.
8.2. Scaliger, Petavius, Christian chronographers and secular chronography
The chronology of ancient and medieval history in its present form was created and completed to a considerable extent in a series of fundamental works of the 16th-19th century beginning with J. Scaliger (1540-1609), the "founder of modern chronological science" ([7], p. 88; [21]) 1 and D. Petavius (1583-1652) (22]. We also recommend the chronological works of the 18th-19th century, which, though mostly obsolete, contain a lot of useful information [23)-[26]. However, the series of these (and other) works is not entirely complete, since, as the well-known chronologist E. Bickerman observes, "there is no adequate, full-scale treatment of ancient chronology" ([7], p. 96, Note 1). The absence of a modern study which would contain strict scientific substantiation and the construction of a global chronology of ancient times and the Middle Ages, based on modern data and methods, may be explained not only by the enormous historical material still requiring further processing and revision, but also by objective difficulties mentioned by various authors investigating at different times the scientific substantiation of chronology. First, let us point out the fact that the appearance, establishment, and initial development of chronology occurred within the Church and was completely under its control for a long time. Ancient chronology is given in the basic works of J. Scaliger and D. Petavius as a table without any substantiation, church tradition alone being its base. This is not surprising, since "for many centuries, history has predominantly been a church science, and was written, as a rule, by the clergy ... " ([8], p. 105). It is assumed today that the foundations of chronology were laid by Eusebius Pamphili and Jerome (4th century A.O.). The work Eusebii Pamphili Chronicorum (Chronicle) and that of Jerome were discovered only in the late



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 91
Middle Ages. Moreover, "the Greek original (of Eusebius' work-A.F.) now exists only in fragments and has been completed by the free Latin translation made by Jerome" (see the Introduction to the Russian translation of the History of the Church by Eusebius, St. Petersburg, 1848, p. viii). It is curious that Nicephorus Callistus made an attempt in the 14th century to write a new history of the first three centuries, i.e., to follow Eusebius' steps, but "could do noting more than repeat what Eusebius had already said ([27*), p. xi). However, the work of Eusebius was published only in 1544 ([27*], p. xiii), i.e., later than that of Nicephorus; hence, the question arises whether Eusebius possibly based his work on Nichephorus Callistus. Beginning with Eusebius and Jerome, almost everyone of the chronologists until the 16th-17th century was often a staunch believer or occupied an official church post (archbishop Jerome, bishop Theophilus, archbishop J. Ussher, theologian J. Scaliger, etc.). That is why the numerical data contained in the Bible and a blind following of church authority originally formed the basis for the chronological approach. As a result of these cabalistic exercises, there appeared, for example, the following "basic dates" from which the entire chronology of the ancient world was then constructed: In the opinion of Ussher, the world was created early in the morning of October 23, 4004 B.c. (see [6]). Furthermore, "secular chronology", which appeared later, was completely based on church dogmas.
". . . the Christian chronographers put secular chronography into the service of sacred history.... Jerome's compilation became the standard of chronological knowledge in the West.... "
"J. Scaliger, the founder of modern chronological science, aimed at reconstructing the work of Eusebius. . . . The datings of Eusebius, often transmitted incorrectly (!-A.F.) in manuscripts, are of little use to us today ... " ([7], pp. 87-88).
Following considerable ambiguity and doubtfulness of these cabalistic calculations, the "date of the creation of the world" varies over a wide range (we illustrate this with some basic examples): 5508 B.C. (Byzantine date), 5493 B.C. (Alexandrian), 4004 (Ussher, Hebrew date), 5872 B.C. (Septuagint), 4700 B.C. (Samaritan), 3761 B.C. (Jewish), 3941 B.C. (Jerome), 5515 (Theophilus), 5551 (Augustine), and so on ([7], p. 73). The amplitude of these dates spans 2100 years. The problem of the choice of a correct "date of the creation of the world" is not at all artificial; it is not accidental that it has received so much attention. As a matter of fact, the overwhelming majority of documents date the described events by years since the "creation of the world" without indicating, however, which "creation" they actually mean. Therefore, the existing multi-millennium discrepancy in the choice of this "date" considerably affects the dating of all documents of this type. The consecration of these "dates" by the Church prevented (up to the 18th century) any critical revision or analysis of the global chronology of ancient times. For example, Scaliger called Eusebius' works "divine" ([27*], p. viii). Being brought up in the spirit of unquestionable veneration of the predecessors' authority, the 16th- and 17th-century chronologists reacted strongly to any "outside"



92 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
criticism. Scaliger himself clearly demonstrated his attitude toward scientific criticism in the following episode. F. Cimpan writes, 2
"The philologist Joseph de Scaliger, the author of a chronological treatise much appreciated by the scientific commwuty, has become a passionate quadraturist ... (name given to people attempting to construct a square which is equal in area to a given circle by means of compass and ruler; this problem is, as is generally known, insoluble-A.F.)" ([36], pp. 149-150).
Scaliger published a book in which he asserted to have established "true quadrature".
"However hard the greatest mathematicians of the epoch-Viete, Clavius-did try to prove to him that ... his reasoning was not correct, everything was useless (it follows from his 'proof' that the perimeter of a regular 196-gon is greater than the length of the circumcircle containing this 1~gon, which is absurd-A .F.). . . . Scaliger grouped his admirers, who passionately sustained their opinion, recognized nothing ... and addressed them ... with injuries and epithets full of contempt, affirming that all geometers had no notion of geometry" ([36), p. 150).
Scaliger first applied (together with Petavius) the astronomical method to the confirmation (but not at all to the critical verification) of the church chronology of the previous centuries. The contemporary historians believed that Scaliger thereby turned church chronology into "scientific" chronology. This shade of "scientific approach" in combination with church authority turned out to be sufficient for the 17th- and 18th-century chronologists to regard the chronological network of available and already considerably conservative data as completely reliable. By the 19th century, the chronological data had expanded so much that it caused respect a priori, at least by its very existence, so that the chronologists of the 19th century saw as their task only the introduction of small insignificant changes into the chronology of ancient times. In the 20th century, the problem is basically regarded as solved, and chronology has finally been perpetuated in the form moulded by the "scriptures" of Eusebius, Jerome, Theophilus, Augustine, Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria, Ussher, Scaliger, and Petavius. For a historian of the 20th century, the very thought that chronologists have followed an erroneous scheme for several hundred years naturally seems to be absurd, for it contradicts accepted "tradition" and the cultural knowledge assimilated since childhood. Nevertheless, with the development and liberation of chronology from church control, serious difficulties arose when new generations of historians attempted to find an agreement between many of the chronological data sources and the established traditional chronology. Thus, for example, it was discovered that Jerome had made an error of one hundred years ([7], p. 89). The so-called Sassanid tradition separated Alexander the Great from the Sassanids by a span of 226 years, and modern historians have increased it to 557 years (a gap of more than 300 years) ([7], p. 89).

§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 93
As Bickerman notes, "The Jews also allotted only 52 years to the Persian period of their history, though 205 years separate Cyrus from Alexander" (according to traditional chronology-A.F.) ((7), p. 89). Egyptian chronology has also been fragmentarily retained by the Christian chronologists. The aforementioned list of Manethonian kings has been preserved only in Christian summaries ([7], p. 82). Some readers probably do not know that "the Eastern Church avoided the use of the Christian dates, since the date of Christ's birth was debated in Constantinople as late as the fourteenth century" ([7], p. 73).
8.3. Questioning the authenticity of Roman tradition. Hypercriticism and T. Mommsen
Consider Roman chronology based on its leading role in the global chronology of ancient times. Extensive criticism of "tradition" and its chronology began as far back as the 18th century at the Academie Royale des Inscriptions et Medailles founded in 1701 in Paris. In the 1720s, the general authenticity of Roman historical tradition began
to be questioned (N. Freret, L. de Pouilly). The accumulated material served as a basis for a more thorough criticism in the 19th century. The well-known historian T. Mommsen was one of the leading authorities in this branch of chronology, which was then called "hypercriticism". He wrote, e.g., that
"King Tarquinius the Second, although he was already grown up at the time of his father's death and did not begin to reign till thirty-nine years afterwards, is nevertheless still a young man when he ascends the throne. Pythagoras, who came to Italy about a generation before the expulsion of the kings (509 B.C.-A.F.), is nevertheless set down by the Roman historians as a friend of the wise Numa (who died ea. 673 B .C.; the discrepancy amounts to at least 100 years-A.F.). The state envoys sent to Syracuse in the year 262 transact business with Oionysius the Elder, who ascended the throne eighty-six years afterwards (348)" ([9], Vol. 3, p. 190).
The traditional chronology of Rome rests on quite a shaky basis. For example, between the different versions of dating of such an important event as the foundation of Rome, there exists a divergence of 500 years ([9], Vol. 3, p. 190). This oscillation strongly accounts for the datings of a large number of sources counting years since the ''foundation of Rome (City)" (e.g., the History of Rome by Livy). In general, "Roman traditional history has survived in the works of quite a few authors; undoubtedly, the most fundamental of them is Livy's" ([12], p. 3). It is assumed that Livy was born ea. 59 B.C. and described 700 years of Rome's history. Of 142 books, only 35 survive; the first edition came out only in 1469 and was based on a lost manuscript of unknown origin; only later a manuscript containing another five books was discovered in Hessia. Theodor Mommsen wrote:
". . . the prospect should be still more lamentable .in the field . . . of the . . . annals . . . of the world. . . . The increasing activity of antiquarian research induced the expectation that the current narrative would be rectified from documents and other



94 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
trustworthy sources; but this hope was not fulfilled. The more and the deeper men investigated, the more clearly it became apparent what a task it was to write a critical history of Rome" ([9], Vol. 5, p. 495).
Moreover,
"The falsification of numbers was here (regarding Valerias Antias-A.F.) carried out down even to contemporary history.... He (Alexander Polyhistor-A.F.) ... took the first steps towards filling up the five hundred years, which were wanting to bring the destruction of Troy and the origin of Rome into the chronological connection (as a matter of fact, according to another version of chronology, different from today's, Troy had fallen immediately before the foundation of Rome, and not 500 years before itA .F.) ... with one of those lists of kings without achievements which a.re unhappily common in the Egyptian and Greek chronicles; for, to all appearance, it was he who launched into the world the kings Aventinus and Tiberinus and the Alban gena of the Silvii whom the following times accordingly did not neglect to furnish in detail with name, period of reigning, and, for the sake of greater definitiveness, also a portrait" ([9), pp. 496-497).
A survey of this criticism can be also found in B. Niese (14]. The lengthy account of the ultrasceptical standpoint questioning the correctness of the "regal Roman,, chronology and, in general, the validity of our knowledge regarding the first five centuries (!) of Roman history can be found in [28) and [29]. (For the difficulties concerning the agreement of Roman documents with traditional chronology, see [30].)
"As a matter of fact, Roman annals themselves do not survive; therefore, all our assumptions should be based on the Roman annalists. However, here, too, we face great difficulties, the main one being that the annalists' works are also in an unsatisfactory state" ([12), p. 23).
It is assumed that all ancient Roman dignitaries were recorded year after year in the Roman / asti. Regarding this, G. Martynov comments:
"But how can the constant controversy about the consuls' names and, moreover, their frequent omission or the perfectly random choice of their names be made consistent? ... It is sometimes impossible to understand the fa.ati, since they are full of ambiguities. Livy himself was aware of this particular weakness of his basic chronological principles" ((13], pp. 6-7, 14).
And G. Martynov assumes that
"... neither Diodorus nor Livy have correct chronology .... We cannot have any confidence in the 'canvas' books, from which Licinius Macer and Tubero drew quite contradictory conclusions. Apparently, upon scrutiny, the most valid documents could also turn out to have been forged much later ... " ([13), pp. 20, 27-28).
Bickerman states:
"As we have the complete fasti of the Roman consuls for 1,050 years . . . we can easily assign Julian years to each of them, provided that the ancient dates are trustworthy ... " ([7), p. 81 ).
8.4. Difficulties in the establishment of Egyptian chronology
The essential discrepancy found between the chronological data of ancient sources and the global chronology of ancient times has been discovered in



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 95
other ones of its branches too. Thus, considerable difficulties accompanied the establishment of Egyptian chronology, where a number of documents contradict each other chronologically. For example, while accounting for the history of Egypt in a consecutive and connected manner, Herodotus places the Pharaoh Rhampsinitus and Cheops next to each other by calling the former the latter's successor. As a modern commentary goes,
"Herodotus mixes up the chronology of Egypt: Rhampsinitus (Ramses II) was Pharaoh of the 19th dynasty (1345-1200 B .C.), while Cheops was a pharaoh of the 4th dynasty from 2600 to 2480 B .C." ([31 *), p. 513, Comm. 136).
Here, the discrepancy with today's chronological version attains 1,200 years. It should be noted that, according to H. Brugsch, Rhampsinitus is Ramses Ill, and not Ramses II ((11], p. 325). In general, it turns out that, from the modern standpoint, the following strange circumstance is valid.
"The chronology of kings due to Herodotus does not correspond to that in the fragments of the Manethonian list" ([31*], p. 512, Comm. 108).
Usually, Herodotus' chronology is essentially "shorter". For example, immediately after a pharaoh of the 4th dynasty, he places another one from the Ethiopian dynasty, i.e., "he jumps from the end of the 4th dynasty (ea. 2480 B.c.) to the beginning of the Ethiopian rule in Egypt (ea. 715 B.c.)" ((31*], p. 516, Comm. 150), closing the 1,800-year "gap". Note that the choice of a particular chronological version from a number of mutually contradictory ones is not always obvious, which, inter alia, illustrates the rivalry between the adherents of the so-called shorter and longer chronology of Egypt, beginning in the 19th century. The famous Egyptologist H. Brugsch wrote that
"German Egyptologists have attempted to fix the era. when Mena, the first Pharaoh, mounted the throne, with the following results:
Boeckh Unger Brugsch
B.C. 5702 5613 4455
Lauth Lepsius Bunsen
B.C. 4157 3892 3623
The difference between the extreme dates is enormous, amounting to no less than 2,079 years! ... " ([11], p. 14).
Brugsch wrote further:
"The most authoritative work and researches can-ied out by competent scientists in order to check the chronological succession of the Pharaohs and whole dynasties proved, meanwhile, the inevitable necessity to suggest simultaneous and parallel reigns in the Manethonian list, which considerably decreases the time required for the ownship of the country by thirty Manethonian dynasties. In spite of all the discoveries in this branch of Egyptology, the numerical data were still in a quite unsatisfactory state at the end of the 19th century" ([11), p. 14). ·
The modern tables also assign the coronation of Menes to different dates, namely to ea. 3100 ([15], pp. 28-29), ea. 3000 B.C. (see the Russian translation of Bickerman's Chronology of the Ancient World, Nauka, Moscow, 1975,



96 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
p. 176), and so forth. The total variation is 2,700 years. However, if we take into account the opinion of the other Egyptologists, the situation becomes still more serious. Namely, according to Champollion, Menes was coronated in 5867; according to Le Sueur, in 5770; according to A. Mariette, in 5004; according to F. Chabas, in 4000; according to E. Meyer, in 3180; according to T. Andrzejewski, in 2850, according to J. Wilkinson, in 2320; and to E. Palmer, in 2224 B.c., and so on. The difference between the dating of Champollion and that of Palmer is 3,643 years. In general, according to Chantepie-de-la Saussaye, Egyptology first "awoke" only 80 years ago. The results of the research were made public too soon; he spoke of the premature assurance of Egyptology; chronology was still hesitant at the time [37]. At present, a shorter chronology has been adopted; however, it is extremely self-contradictory, with the uncertainties still unresolved today. Still more complicated is the situation with the list of kings, compiled by the Sumerian priests,
". . . a sort of skeleton of history . . . of our English schoolbooks, but unfortunately it did not seem to help.... The entire chronology is palpably absurd" ((32], p. 14).
Moreover, it turns out that the dynastic sequence was set arbitrarily ([32*), p. 107). The very ancient age ascribed today to these lists contradicts the archaeological data. In his description of the excavations of regal tombs in Mesopotamia, L. Woolley speaks of a series of golden toilet sets which were found, one of the best experts declaring that the things were made by the Arabs in the 13th century A.O.! And he cannot be censured for the blunder, adds L. Woolley condescendingly: No one could supp~e the craft to be so skillful in the 3rd millennium B.C. ([32] and [32*], p. 61). The well-known historian of science Otto Neugebauer wrote:
"With the use of an enormous learned apparatus, the author (Jeremiah-A.F.) develops the panbabylonistic doctrine which flourished in Germany between 19001914.... This school was built on wild theories about the great age of Babylonian astronomy.... A supreme disregard created a fantastic picture which exercised (and still exercises) a great influence on the literature concerning Babylonia" {[40], p. 138).
8.5. Competing chronological versions. De Arcilla, J. Hardouin, I. Newton and R. Baldauf
It turns out that simultaneously with Scaliger's and Petavius' versions of the global chronology still accepted today, another, competing hypothesis negating the first, and indicating the "youth" of the "written history" known to us, was born as early as the 16th century A.O. We illustrate this with the following citation from Morozov's book [l]:
"Professor de Arcilla of Sal&mA11ca University published two of his works Programma Hiatoriae Univeraalia and Divinae Florae Hiatoricae in the 16th century, where he stated that the whole of ancient history had been forged in the Middle Ages; the same conclusions were reached by the Jesuit historian and archaeologist J. Hardouin (1646-1729), who regarded the classical literature as written by the monks of the preceding, 16th century A .D. (see his books Conailiorum Collectio regia



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology
maxima, Ghronologiae ex nvmmia antiqvia reatitvtae prolvaio de nvmmia Herodiadvm, Prolegomena ad cenauram veterum acriptorum). The German Privatdozent Robert Baldauf wrote his book Hi,torie und Kritik in 1902-1003, where he asserted on the basis of purely philological argument that not only ancient, but even medieval history
was a falsification of the Renaissance and subsequent centuries" ([t], Vol. 7, p. vii-viii, Introduction).
97
The famous Isaac Newton in his Abreges de la Chronologie, containing the work of forty years of investigation, sharply criticized traditional chronology. Many events of Greek history were shifted by him forwards by 200-300 years, which coincides with the first chronological shift I discovered, and is described in my publications (see above). Many events of Egyptian history were "shifted forwards" by I. Newton by about 1,800 years, which again, quite suddenly, coincides with the third chronological shift of the author (see above). The enormous work performed by Newton was taken skeptically by his contemporaries. W. Whiston wrote:
"Sir Isaac Newton composed a Chronology, and wrote 18 copies of its first and principal chapter with his own hand . . . which proved no better than a sagacious romance" ([89], p. 35).
8.6. Tacitus and Bracciolioni. Cicero and Barzizza
It is generally known that most of global chronology was initially constructed by analyzing the chronological references of ancient written sources; the question of their origin then becomes quite interesting. Unfortunately, modern historiography supplies no complete survey of the circumstances in which the ancient manuscripts appeared and only notes the general fact that the overwhelming majority of the documents were discovered as early as the Renaissance, years after the "dark ages". It is clear that the manuscripts often appeared in an environment which was not conducive to speeding up a critical analysis of the datings. The two well-known 19th-century historians P. Hochart from France and J. Ross from England "proved" in 1882-1885 and 1878, respectively, that the History of Tacitu.s Cornelius had been actually written by the well-known humanist Poggio Bracciolini (38, 39]. Without discussing the authenticity of the History (in our opinion, it is authentic, has not been falsified, and describes authentic events), we note that the history of its discovery really led to considerable controversy. It was Poggio Bracciolioni who had discovered and published the works of Quintilian, Valerius Flaccus, Marcellus, Probus, certain treatises of Cicero, Lucretius, Petronius, Plautus, Tertullian, St. Marcellinus, Calpurnius Siculus, and so forth [38, 39]. Besides the original manuscripts, Bracciolioni traded in copies which he sold for enormous sums of money. For example, after having sold a copy of Livy, Bracciolioni bought himself a villa in Florence. The circumstances of these findings and the manuscripts' dating have never been made clear.



98 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
In the 15th century, Italy saw the arrival of the famous humanists Manuel Chrysoloras, Georgius Gemistos Pletho, Bessarion of Nicae, and others, who
were first (!) to acquaint Europe with the· achievements of the allegedly "ancient" Greek thought. The Byzantine Empire then gave the West almost all the preserved Greek manuscripts of antiquity. In Neugebauer's words:
"The majority of manuscripts on which our knowledge of Greek science is based are Byzantine codices, written between 500 and 1500 years after the lifetime of their authors" ([40], p. 57).
According to traditional history, the whole of classical ancient literature became known only during the years of the Renaissance or immediately before this epoch (41]. Analysis shows that the vagueness of its origin and the absence of documented data regarding it in the preceding, so-called Dark Ages makes us suggest that the texts had been previously nonexistent [l]. For example, the oldest manuscripts of the so-called incomplete recension of Cicero's texts are those of the 9th and 10th century; however, the archetype of the incomplete recension had been "lost long ago" [42*]. In the 14th and 15th century, Cicero's works attracted more and more attention, and
". . . it came to the Milan Professor Gasparine Barzizza . . . having undertaken in ea. 1420 A .D. the risky business of filling by himself gaps in the 'incomplete recension' to make it consistent (!-A.F.). No sooner had he finished the job than a miracle occurred: in the sleepy Italian town of Lodi, a lost manuscript with the complete text of all of Cicero's rhetorical works was found .... Barzizza and his disciples rushed onto the new find, deciphered its ancient script (probably of the 13th century A.D.), and, finally, made a copy which could be read easily. The transcripts were made from this one, and they are the ones which make up the 'complete recension'. . . . Meanwhile, the incorrigible took place: the archetype of the recension, i.e., the Lodi manuscript, turned out to be neglected; nobody wanted to rack his brains over its difficult text; it was sent back to Lodi and lost there foreverj since A .D. 1428, nothing has been known about its fate. The European philologists deplore the loss even today" ((42*], pp. 387-388).
Suetonius' De vitis XII Caesarum is also only available in much later transcripts, all originating from "one antique manuscript" allegedly possessed by Einhard, who, while creating his Vita K aroli Magni (Life of Charlemagne) in ea. A.O. 818, carefully reproduced the assumingly biographical stories of Suetonius [43]. The Codex Fuldensis and the first copies have not survived [43]. The oldest manuscript of Suetonius is that of the 9th century, but it became known only in the 16th century, whereas the others art: dated to not earlier than the 11th century A.D.
8.7. Vitruvius and L. Alberti
Ancient sources were dated in the 14th-16th century on some unknown basis. The architect Vitruvius' De architectura was discovered only in 1497. In its
astronomical part, he very precisely listed the sidereal (!) periods of the major planets ([1], Vol. 4, p. 624). Allegedly living in the lst-2nd century A.D., Vitruvius knew them better than Copernicus. The period of Saturn differs from the contemporary value by only 0.0007; for Mars, the error is only 0.006,



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 99
and 0.003 for Jupiter ([1], Vol. 4, pp. 625-626). Note the far-reaching parallels between Vitruvius' books and those of the remarkable 15th-century humanist L. Alberti (44]. (By the way, due to frequently assimilated "v" and "b", it may be even conjectured that the names themselves are close: Alb(v)ertiVitruvius.) Like Vitruvius, Alberti (1404-1472) was famous as the greatest Italian architect, author of the well-known architectural theory which is related, in the closest manner, to the similar theory of Vitruvius (44]. Just like Vitruvius, he created a fundamental work including not only his theory of architecture, but also some information from mathematics, optics, and mechanics. It is strange that the title of Alberti's book Di re aedificatoria is similar to that by Vitruvius. It is now assumed that Alberti modelled his own treatise on Vitruvius' work [44). The work of Alberti is wholly in "antique tones". Specialists have long ago constructed tables in which Alberti 's and Vitruvius' works are juxtaposed (sometimes coinciding verbatim!). Thus, the book of Vitruvius (as well as that of Alberti) absolutely naturally corresponds to the atmosphere and ideology of the 15th century. The overwhelming majority of Alberti's buildings were designed "in antique style". He erected a palace "after a Roman amphitheatre". Thus, the leading architect of the Renaissance fills the cities of Italy with antique buildings which are regarded now (but not at all in the 15th century) as "imitations of antiquity". Alberti wrote books in "antique manner", not giving any thought to that they could later be called "imitations of antiquity" by the historians. And it was only in 1497 that the book of the alleged "ancient" architect Vitruvius was discovered, which almost verbatim coincides with an earlier and similar book of Alberti. It is possible that the architects of the 14th-15th century did not regard their activities as an "imitation of antiquity", but created it. However, the theory of "imitation" will appear in the works of much later researchers. It is probably due to the chronological shift of some of the medieval documents, buildings, etc., into oldest antiquity. In particular, this could have led to "doubling" Alberti, trebling Pletho, and so forth.
8.8. "The chaos of medieval datings" (E. Bickerman). Medieval anachronisms and medieval concepts of time
The history of finding and publishing ancient scientific treatises in all its essential features is similar to that of manuscripts in the humanities. M. Ya. Vygodsky wrote:
"No antique manuscript of the Element& by Euclid has survived. . . . The most ancient of the manuscripts known to us is a copy made in A.D. 888.... There are many manuscripts dated by the 10th-13th-century" ([87), p. 224).
I.G. Bashmakova informs us that, even before the first Latin translation of Arithmetica,
"... the European scientists had made use of Diophantus' algebraic methods, not being familiar with his works" ([111], p. 25).



100 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Bashmakova characterizes this situation just as "somewhat paradoxical". And I.N. Veselovsky says that the basis for all modern editions of Archimedes' works is a lost manuscript of the 15th century and the so-called Constantinople palimpsest found only in 1907. It is assumed that Archimedes' manuscripts first appeared in Europe after 1204 ([112], pp. 54-56).
"The Conics of Apollonius were published only in 1537, his works having been published only after the death of Johann Kepler, who had discovered the importance of the described objects" {(94], p. 54).
The chronological version of Scaliger was not at all unique. In general, Bickerman deploringly speaks of "the chaos of medieval datings" ([71, p. 78). Besides, the analysis of ancient documents demonstrates that the earlier ideas of time were greatly different from the modern. Before the invention of the clock, time had been regarded as "anthropomorphic", and the character of its course depended (!) on the character of the events. Until the 13th-14th century, devices for measuring time were a rarity and luxury [45].
"The sundial ... sandpiece and clepsydra were common in medieval Europe, with the sundial being suitable only when it is fine, and the clepsydra remaining a rarity" ([8], p. 94).
At the end of the 9th century A .D., candles were widely used to measure time; for example, the king of England, Alfred, took candles of equal length when travelling, and ordered to light them one after another ([8], p. 95). The same time count was employed even in the 13th and 14th century, for example, at the time of Charles V.
"The monks orientated themselves by the pages of the Sacred books or psalms read between two observations of the sky" ([8}, p. 94).
For exact astronomical observations, a clock with the second hand was required, but
"... even after the invention and wide use in Europe of the mechanical clock, it did not have the minute hand for a very long time" ([8], p. 95).
Otto Spengler in his The Decline of the West asserted that the mechanical clock had been invented ea. A.D. 1000 by A. Gerbert. However, A.Ya. Gurevich asserts that Gerbert only made the clepsydra more sophisticated, and that
11••• the mechanical clock was invented at the end of the 13th century A.O." ((8), pp. 134-135).
It is generally known that a precise time piece is required for astronomical observations. However, the following strange phenomenon occurred: Appearing in China, the Europeans acquainted the Chinese with some of their own inventions. The mechanical clock did interest the Chinese rulers, but not as a precise time piece-just as a funny toy! ([88], pp. 80-87). And it is traditionally believed that precise Chinese astronomy had blossomed thousands of years B.c.!



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 101
The most intricate chronological cabbala was born and developed in the Middle Ages in a paradoxical contrast with the inaccuracy of measuring real time. In particular,
"... the same time intervals which are used for measuring earth ... time acquire quite a different duration.... When used to measure biblical events ... Augustine equalized each day of the Creation to a millennium (!-A.F.) and attempted to determine the duration of the history of mankind... " ([8], pp. 109-110).
Such an intrinsic feature of medieval historiography as anachronism is very important for us.
"The past is represented in terms of the same categories as in modern times.... The biblical and ancient historical figures are dressed in medieval costumes. . . . Depicting 1cings and patriarchs of the Old Testament with ancient sages and evangelical personages side by side on cathedral portals discloses the anachronistic attitude toward history best of all. ... The crusaders were convinced at the end of the 11th century that they castigated not the descendants of the Saviour's murderers, but the murderers themselves... " ([8], pp. 117-118).
Proceeding from traditional chronology, the modern historians believe that the Middle Ages "mixed up epochs and notions" on a very large scale, that the medieval authors identified ancient biblical epoch with that of the Middle Ages only because of their "ignorance". But, besides the traditional explanation (alleged inexplicable "love for anachronisms"), another point of view is possible, namely, that all these statements of medieval authors, which seem strange now, are authentic and are regarded as "anachronisms" only because we follow another chronology. Traditional chronology (Scaliger's version) only fixed one of several medieval chronological conceptions. Along with the chronology adopted today, other versions existed earlier, too. For example, the 10th-13th-century Holy Roman Empire was regarded to have immediately followed the Roman Empire, which, according to the modern ideas, occurred in the 6th century A.O. ([46], Vol. 1, p. 16). Here are the traces of the strange medieval controversy (from the modern standpoint). Assumingly basing himself on a whole series of philological and psychological observations, Petrarch asserted that the privileges given by Caesar and Nero to the Austrian duchy (in the 13th century A.D.!-A.F.) were forged. (Then it had to be proved.) ([46], Vol. 1, p. 32). For a modern specialist, the very thought that Caesar and Nero meant the
Austrian duchy who began ruling only in A.D. 1273, i.e., 1200 years later, is absurd (ibid.). But Petrarch's 14th century opponents did not think so ("it had to be proved at that time" (46). Regarding the same documents, E. Priester noted that all the interested people understood quite well that they had obviously been falsified and shamelessly forged (this being today's point of view); nevertheless, they "politely" turned a blind eye to this circumstance (17]. For example, the reader is accustomed to the thought that the famous gladiator fights took place only in "the far-away past". But this is not so. After writing about the gladiators' fights in ancient Rome, V.I. Klassovsky adds immediately that they also occurred in 14th-century Europe (47]! He



102 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
also points to fights in Naples in ea. A.O. 1344 ([47], p. 212). As in antiquity, these medieval fights ended in the death of a fighter [47].
8.9. The chronology of the biblical manuscripts. L. Tischendorf
Dating of religious sources remains very much unclear. The chronology and dating of the biblical books are quite uncertain and are generally known to be based on the authority of the Christian theologians of the late Middle Ages.
"The most ancient of more or less complete surviving copies of the Bible are the Codex Alexandrinua, Codex Vaticanua, Codex Sinaiticua. ... All three manuscripts ... are dated (paleographically, i.e., on the basis of compa.ring the 'handwriting style' of the manuscript with that of other manuscripts whose dating is ta.ken as known a priori-A.F.) ... by the second half of the 4th century A .0. The language of the Codices is Greek.... The lesser known is the Codex Vatica,uu; in pa.rticular, it is not clear how and whence this source appeared in the Vatican in ea.. 1475.... It is known about the Codex Alexandrinua that ... the patriarch Cyrilles Lucaris presented it as a gift to the king of Great Britain and Ireland, Charles I, in 1628" ((48], pp. 267-268).
The Codex Sinaiticus was discovered only in the 19th century by L. Tischendorf ([48], pp. 268-270). Of the same type of sources are the Codex Bezae and Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus. These are palimpsests, i.e., writing materials which were cleared and reused. A scribe erased the biblical text from a parchment allegedly somewhere between the 12th and the 13th century, and wrote instead the work of Ephraem Syrus (note how expensive the parchment was!). It is due to this document that Tischendorf made a name for himself by "dating" it to the 5th century A .o. Thus, all three of these most ancient codexes were actually discovered only after the 15th century. The reputation of these documents as being ancient was based on Tischendorf's authority, judging by the "handwriting style". However, the idea itself of paleographic dating assumes that the global chronology of other documents is known a priori; hence, this dating method is not independent. Of the individual biblical works, the most ancient one is the manuscript of the Book of the Prophet Zechariah and that of Malachi, dated to the 15th century A.D. (also paleographically) [48]. We should also bear in mind the strange fact that "the most ancient of the surviving manuscripts of the Bible have been written in Greek" ([48], p. 270). No Jewish manuscripts of the Bible dated to earlier than the 9th century
A.O. (!) exist, though those of later times, mainly of the middle of the 13th century A.O., are kept in many national libraries. The most ancient Jewish manuscript containing the complete text of the Old Testament is referred only to A.O. 1008 ([48], p. 270). The biblical Canon is assumed to have been established by the synod at Laodicea in A .o. 363; however, no acts of this and earlier synods survived [49]. In reality, the Canon was officially established only since the new Council of Trent had assembled in 1545 and lasted, with intervals, until 1563 (during



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 103
the Reformation). By the order of the Council, many books were regarded as apocryphal, in particular, the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel ([50], p. 76). It turns out that most datings of biblical manuscripts are overwhelmingly based on paleography. We have pointed out that this depends on a global chronology assumed to be known a priori. We illustrate this with the following example.
"In 1902, the Englishman Nash bought in Egypt a fragment of a Jewish manuscript written on a papyrus, the dating of which the scientists C&llllot agree upon until today" ((48), p. 273).
Finally, it was agreed that the text referred to the turn of our millennium.
". . . after the Qumran manuscripts had been discovered, the comparison of the 'handwriting' on the Nash papyrus and the Qumran scrolls made it possible to establish at once that the latter were quite old" ((48), pp. 272-273).
Thus, one scrap of the papyrus, whose dating was not "agreed upon by everyone", influenced the dating of all the other documents. Nevertheless,
"... dating the manuscripts (of Qumran-A.F.) led to much controversy among the scientists (namely, from the 2nd century B .C. to the time of the crusaders)" ((50), p. 47).
For example, the American historian S. Zeitlin categorically insists on the medieval origin of the texts ([48), p. 27). It is assumed today that the original dating of the Qumran scrolls to the turn of the millennium was confirmed by radiocarbon dating. However, as will be shown below, it is extremely unstable for comparatively small time intervals, and the application to events which are 2-3 millennia old is quite problematic due to the obtained "scattering" by up to about one thousand years (for the indicated time interval).
8.10. Vowels in ancient manuscripts
In the attempt to read and date most of the ancient, medieval, biblical, ancient Egyptian, and other manuscripts, certain basic problems are frequently encountered. As soon as J. Sunderland started investigating the original language of the Old Testament, he, in his words,
". . . faced the fa.et of enormous and even startling importance. The thing is that the Jewish written language originally had neither vowels nor signs replacing them. The books of the Old Testament were written only with consonants" ((49), p. 155).
This is also typical for other languages. For example, an ancient Slavonic text was a chain of only consonants, too; sometimes even without signs replacing the vowels, or without division into words. Old Egyptian texts were also written in consonants only. According to E. Bickerman,
". . . the names of Egyptian kings are given in contemporary literature schematically, in a quite arbitrary, so-called scholastic manner adopted in school textbooks. These forms are often greatly different from ea.eh other; it is impossible to order them somehow, due to their arbitrary reading(!) which became traditional" ([7*), p. 176).



104 New Experimental and StatisticQI Methods Chapter 3
Probably, the rarity and high cost of writing materials in ancient times made the scribes save them, and omit the vowels, thereby essentially shortening the text. It is also possible that writing out all the words in a row, without intervals between them, pursued the same goal. However, if we take the Jewish Bible or a manuscript today, we shall find in them the skeleton of vowels filled with dots and other signs denoting the missing vowels. These signs did not belong to the old Jewish Bible. The books were read by consonants, and the intervals were filled with vowels according to one's skill and the apparent requirements of the context and oral legends [49]. Imagine how exact the meaning of a word written in consonants can be if, for example, CLN can mean clean, clan, colon, and so forth! According to T. Curtis, even for the priests, the content of manuscripts remained extremely doubtful and could be understood only by means of the authority of the legend ([49], p. 155). It is assumed that this serious shortcoming of the Jewish Bible had been eliminated not earlier than the 7th or 8th century A.D., when the Massoretes revised the Bible and added signs replacing the vowels; but they had no manuals, except their own reason, and a very imperfect legendary tradition ((49), pp. 156-157). S. Driver adds that, since the times of the Massoretes in the 7th-8th century A.D., the Jews have taken to keeping their sacred books with extraordinary care, but then it was too late to repair the damage already done. The result of such attentiveness was just the immortalization of the distortions, which were then placed on exactly the same level of authority with the original text ([49], p. 157). The opinion reigning earlier was that the vowels had been introduced into the Jewish text by Ezra in the 5th century B.C. But in the 16th and 17th century, E. Levita and J. Capellus in France refuted this opinion and proved that the vowels had been introduced only by the Massoretes. The discovery created a sensation in the whole of Protestant Europe. Many people believed that the new theory would lead to disproving the religion completely. If the vowels were not a matter of Divine Revelation, but only a human invention, besides, a much later one, then how could we rely on the text of the Scripture? This discussion was one of the hottest in the history of the new biblical criticism and proceeded for more than a century, stopping only when the validity of the new point of view was acknowledged by everyone ((49], pp. 157-158).
8.11. Traditional biblical geography
Even if the vowels of common words are not that important, the situation changes completely when their combination meaning a city, country, the name of a king, etc., appears in an ancient text. Tens and hundreds of different variants of vowels for one term may be found, starting the "identifications" of the biblical vowel-free names of cities, countries, and others, made by traditional historians proceeding from the chronological version of J. Scaliger and the localization referring the biblical events to the Near East. As the archaeologist M. Burrows notes, the archaeological job generally leads to the undoubtedly



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 105
strongest creed in the reliability of biblical information (48]. F. Kenyon of the British Museum insists as much categorically on archaeology refuting the "destructive skepticism of the second half of the 19th century". (W. Kelley has published a book with the remarkable title Und die Bibel hat doch Recht, asserting that the Bible was right anyway.) But here is information reported by the well-known archaeologist G. Wright, who, by the way, is a staunch partisan of the correctness of orthodox localization and of dating biblical events. He wrote,
"A great many findings do not prove or disprove anything; they fill the background and only serve as historical artifacts. Unfortunately, the desire 'to prove' the Bible permeates many works available to the average reader. Historical evidence may be used in an incorrect manner, whereas the conclusions drawn are often erroneous and only half correct" ([48)1 p. 17).
If we attentively examine the concrete facts, then we shall see that none of the books of the Old Testament contain any solid archaeological confirmation of their traditional geographical and time localization. The whole "Mesopotamian" biblical theory will be questioned (1]. I.A. Kryvelev wrote,
"The traditional localization of the events described in the New Testament is no better. The reader interested in biblical archeology may be bewildered by the hundreds of pages speaking of excavations, landscapes, or artifacts, historical and biblical background. And, in conclusion, when it comes to the results of the whole job, there are only a number of indistinct and imprecise statements about the problem not having been completely solved, but that there is still hope for the future, and so forth. We may be absolutely sure that none of the stories of the New Testament contains any somewhat convincing archaeological confirmation (in terms of the traditional localization-A.F.). This is perfectly true, in particular, if applied to the figure and biography of Jesus Christ. Not a single spot traditionally regarded as the arena of a particular event occurring in the New Testament can be indicated with the slightest degree of confidence" ([48), pp. 200-201).
We note at the same time that, along with the traditional point of view which as we have seen has no sure confirmation, there also exist other, competing versions. For example, beginning with the 13th century A.D., the Catholic Church declared that, in the Italian town of Loreto, there was the very house where the Virgin Mary lived and where she met the archangel Gabriel ((48], p. 198). It turns out that "Loreto is a place of pilgrimage of Catholics up to the present day" ([90], p. 37).
8.12. Problems of geographical localization of ancient events
Considerable difficulties accompany the attempts of geographical localization of many of the ancient events and cities. For example, Naples (which means simply "new town") figured in many ancient chronicles in several images, and in essentially different geographical regions, namely, Naples in Italy, Carthage (which also means "new city") [51], Naples in Palestine [52], Scythian Naples, and others. One of the localizations of the famous city of Troy is near the



106 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Hellespont (for which, though, there are also several quite different geographical localizations). It is for this particular reason that Schliemann ascribed the name of Troy to the city he excavated near the Hellespont. According to traditional chronology, Troy was completely destroyed in the 12-13th century B.C. [7]. But, in the Middle Ages, Italian Troy, which still exists today [53], enjoyed widespread fame. This is the celebrated medieval city which played an important role in many medieval wars; especially, in the well-known war of the 13th century. Many Byzantine historians also speak of Homer's Troy as of an existing medieval city, namely, Choniates Nicetas [54] and Gregoras Nicephoras (55]. Livy indicates the spot named Troy and the Trojan region in Italy ((56], Vol. 1, pp. 3-4, Bk. 1). Certain medieval historians identified Troy with Jerusalem ([57], pp. 88, 235, 162, 207), which embarrasses the modern commentators:
"The book of Homer somewhat suddenly turned (in the medieval text, while describing Alexander's expedition to Troy-A.F.) ... into the book on the destruction of Jerusalem" ((57], p. 162).
Anna Comnena, speaking of Ithaca (homeland of Homer's Odyssey), declares that a large city called Jerusalem has been built on the island of Ithaca ([58], Vol. 2). The second name of Troy is Ilion, whereas the second name of Jerusalem is Aelia Capitolina ([1], Vol. 7). Thus, in the names of these cities, there is a similarity: Aelia-Ilion. Eusebius Pamphili told that two small Phrygian towns with totally different names were called Jerusalem ([1], Vol. 7, p. 893)! It is traditionally assumed that Great Greece always was on the Balkan Peninsula; however, in the Middle Ages, the south of Italy populated by Greek colonies was also called Great Greece [27]. It is also believed that the town of Babel was situated in modern Mesopotamia. Certain ancient texts are of a different opinion. For example, the medieval Serbian text of the Romance of Alexander the Great places Babel in Egypt; moreover, according to this text, Alexander the Great died in Egypt, whereas he is believed to have deceased in Mesopotamia according to the traditional version ([57], p. 255). Furthermore, Babel is the Greek name of a city located opposite the pyramids. During the Middle Ages, Cairo was sometimes called by this name. Nowadays, it is a suburb of Cairo [59]. The term "babel" has a meaningful translation (as have the names of many other cities); hence, it has been applied to different towns by different chroniclers. That Rome was called Babel in the Middle Ages was reported by Eusebius (27]. Moreover, by Babel, the Byzantine historians (in the Middle Ages!) more often than not meant Baghdad [60]. The medieval Byzantine author of the 11th century, Michael Psellus, speaks of Babel as of an existing and not at all destroyed city [60]. In many documents, there is a confusion between two Romes, namely, Rome in Italy and New Rome (i.e., Constantinople on the Bosphorus). Both Romes are the capitals of the two famous empires, the Western and Eastern ones. The citizens of New Rome stubbornly called themselves "Romans''. A large percentage of Byzantine coins were supplied with Latin, and not Greek, inscriptions. The capital of the new empire was transferred both from Rome to



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 107
New Rome (by Constantine I, ea. A.O. 330) and, vice versa, from New Rome to Rome (attempt to transfer it in A.O. 663 by Constantine III) [l]. It is possible that the identification of Constantinople with Troy and the famous ''Trojan war" is a partial reflection of the battle in A.O. 1204 between the crusaders and the Byzantine Empire {the fall of Constantinople in A.O. 1204). The complete manuscript of Histories by Herodotus was first discovered only in the 15th century [31]. This famous manuscript was brought by the Byzantine scientists to Western Europe after the capturing of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453. The importance of Herodotus for traditional history cannot be underestimated. But he declares, quite unexpectedly, that the Nile flows parallel to the Ister, which is now identified with the Danube (and not the Dniester). It turns out that "the opinion that the Danube and the Nile are parallel reigned in Medieval Europe even up to the end of the 13th century". Thus Herodotus makes the typical error that is characteristic of medieval authors. The identification of Herodotus' geographical data with the modern map entails great difficulties within the framework of the events described in traditional localization. In particular, numerous corrections which the modern commentators are forced to introduce if they perform such identification show that "Herodotus' map" is, possibly, reversed with respect to the modern one (with East and West interchanged). Such orientation is typical for many a medieval map. The commentators are forced to assume on different pages of Herodotus' Histories the same names for quite different seas. For example, according to the modern commentators, to retain the traditional localization of events described by Herodotus, the following "identifications" should be made, namely, Red Sea
= Southern Sea = Black Sea = Mediterranean Sea = Arabian Gulf= Our
Sea = Indian Ocean. The fact that Herodotus mentions Crestonia and Creston seems to be quite strange. For Herodotus, there exist even the whole region of Crestonia, the town of Creston, the country of Crossae, and the district of Crestonaei. According to Herodotus, the Crestonaei were invaders from other countries (31]. It is possible that all these references were related to the medieval Crusaders ( "cross" is also a Crusader term used in the Middle Ages) flooding Greece in the 12th-13th centuries. {See also works asserting that 15.44 of Tacitus' Annals originally had christianos for chrestianos, which also assimilates Herodotus' terminology to the medieval one [38].
8.13. Modern analysis of biblical geography
Many strange phenomena occur in an unprejudiced analysis of biblical geography (1]. That many biblical texts describe volcanic activity has been stressed in history long ago.
"The Lord said to Moses, 'I am now coming to you in a thick cloud.... But when the ram's horn sounds (when the cloud leaves Mount Sinai-A.F.), they may go up the mountain' ... there were peals of thunder and flashes of lightning, a dense cloud



108 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
on the mountain and a loud trumpet blast.... Mount Sinai was all smoking because the Lord had come down upon it in fire; the smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln ... and the sound of the trumpet grew ever louder" (Ex 19:9, 13, 16, 18).
"... all the people saw how it thundered and the lightning flashed, when they heard the trumpet sound and saw the mountain smoking ... " (Ex 20:18);
". . . you stood . . . at Horeb. . . . The mountain was ablaze with fire to the very skies: there was darkness, cloud, and thick mist" (Dt:10-11).
The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah has long been regarded in history to have been due to a volcanic eruption. For example:
". . . and then the Lord rained down fire and brimstone from the skies on Sodom and Gomorrah.... He saw thick smoke rising high from the earth like the smoke of a lime-kiln" (Gn 19:24,28).
Here is a list of apparent volcanic eruptions mentioned in the Bible (compiled by V.P. Fomenko and T.G. Fomenko): Gn 19:18,24; Ex 13:21, 22; 14:18; 20:15; 24:15,16,17; Nm 14:14; 21:28; 26:10; Dt 4:11,36; 5:19,20,21; 9:15,21; 10:4; 32:22; S 22:8-10,13; 1 K 18:38,39; 19:11,12; 2 K 1:10-12,14; Ne 9:12,19; Ps 11:6; Ps 106: 17; Ps 106:18; Ezk 38:22; Je 40, 8:45, Lam 2:3; 4:11; Is 4:5; 5:25; 9:17,18; 10:17; 30:30; JI 2:3,5,10. To associate (as is done traditionally) all these descriptions with Mt. Sinai (and Jerusalem) seems doubtful; it is generally known that it has never been a volcano. Where did the events occur then? It suffices to study the geological map of the Mediterranean area ([61), pp. 380-381, 461). There are no acting volcanoes in the Sinai peninsula, Syria, or Palestine; there are only zones of tertiary and quaternary volcanism, as, for example, near Paris. In the above-mentioned regions, where the biblical events are traditionally located, no volcanic activity has been discovered since the birth of Christ. The only powerful, and by the way, acting volcanic zone, is Italy together with Sicily. Besides, Egypt and North Africa have no volcanoes [61). Thus, we have to find (1) a powerful volcano active in the historical era; (2) a destroyed capital (see the book of the Prophet Jeremiah) near the volcano; (3) two other cities destroyed by the volcano, namely, Sodom and Gomorrah. There exists such a volcano in the Mediterranean, and it is unique, namely, the famous Vesuvius, one of the most powerful volcanoes in history. Famed Pompeii ("capital"?) and two destroyed cities Stabiae (Sodom?) and Herculaneum (Gomorrah?) are located nearby. We cannot but mention a certain similarity in the names of these Italian and biblical towns. It is possible that the name of Sinai for Vesuvius originates from the Latin Sino (sinus), and Horeb from the Latin hoTT"ibilis (horrible). The following analytic study worth mentioning, which permits to read the vowel-free text of the Bible, was performed in [1]. It took into account placing Mt. Sinai-Horeb-Zion in Italy. We illustrate by examples.



§8 Problems of Historical Chronology 109
"The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb and said, 'You have stayed on this mountain long enough; go now, make for all Cana.an... "' (Dt 1:7).
The theologicans supply the Hebrew KNN with vowels as Canaan and place it in the desert on the Dead Sea coast, but another solution is also possible,
namely, KNN = GENOA (Italian Genoa), "... all Canaan and the Lebanon ... " (Dt 1:7). The theologicans restore the Hebrew LBN with vowels as Lebanon; however lebanon means "white", i.e., the same as Mont Blanc, or White Mountain: "... as far as the great river, the PRT" (Dt 1:7). The theologicans restore PRT with vowels and decipher it as the Euphrates; but, there is the large tributary of the Danube, the Prut, located in central Europe, as beyond Mont Blanc.
"Then we set out from Horeb . . . and marched through that vast and terrible wilderness" (Dt 1:19).
In fact, the famous Phlegraei, vast and burnt-out spaces filled with small volcanoes, fumaroles, and solidified lava streams are located near VesuviusHoreb. "... and so we came to KDS-BRN" (Dt 1:19). KDS-BRN is supplied with vowels as Kadesh-Barnea, which is, possibly, a town on the Rhone ([1], Vol. 2, p. 166). It is also possible that modern Geneva was meant: "... and we spent many days marching round the hill-country of Seir" (Dt 2:1). Mount Seir was left without translation; however, if it is translated, we obtain Devil's Mountain(s). And there is such a mountain near Lake Geneva, namely Le Diableret ( "Devil's Mountain"). Then, the "Children of Lot" (Dt 2:9) met on the way can be identified with the Latins (LT) ([1], Vol. 2, p. 167); "... and cross the gorge of the Arnon ... " (Dt 2:24); but, this is the Italian river Arno: "Next we ... advanced ... to Bashan" (Dt 3:1). The town Bashan is often mentioned in the Bible. It is surprising that Bassano still exists in Lombardy. "... king of Bashan ... came out against us at Edrei" (Dt 3:1). Adria is still here, on the Po delta; the Po, by the way, has often been mentioned by ancient Latin authors (e.g., Procopius) and called the Jordan (in Procopius' Eridanus ), which is very consistent with the biblical spelling of the Jordan, namely, hay-yarden ([l], Vol. 2, p. 167). "... and we captured all his cities ... sixty cities ... " (Dt 3:3-4). Indeed, in the Middle Ages, there were many big cities in the region: Verona, Padua, Ferrara, Bologna, and others. "... from the gorge of the Arnon to Mount Hermon (= HRMN)" (Dt 3:8). But it is obvious that MNT HRMN can be supplied with vowels to be translated as the "German mountains". "Only the Og king of Bashan remained ... His sarcophagus of iron may still be seen in the ... city of Rabbah" (Dt 3:11). Here is mentioned not only Ravenna, but also the famous tomb of Theodoric
of the Ostrogoths (Og = Goths?), built in A.D. 493-526. There follows TBRH (Taberah in biblical translation), which is naturally identified with the Tiber in Italy; ZN is Siena, southeast of Livorno; and HBRN, i.e. "Gorge du Rhone", a town on the Rhone ([1], Vol. 2, pp. 229-237). The slopes of Monte Viso are called Jebus (Jgs 19:10-11) in the Bible, and Rome is called Ramah (Jgs 19:14).



110 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
According to the statistical analysis of ancient texts (see details below), and if the vowels are left out, the following geographical identifications may be consistent: Assyria= Germany, France= Persia (PRS), Jerusalem= Rome or Pompeii, Media = Hungary. Furthermore, due to the impossibility of the European location of many of the biblical events and terms, we stress that the word Venetiae could have been read by the ancients both as Venice and Phoenicia (Phoinike).
8.14. Ancient originals and medieval duplicates. Anachronisms as a common feature in medieval chronicles
The "Renaissance effect" of duplicating antiquity is vividly expressed in traditional chronology. Plato is the founder of Platonism; his teachings were revived several hundreds of years later by another, the famous Neoplatonist Plotinus (A.O. 205270). His name is almost identical to that of his teacher Plato. Neoplatonism then died, too, but was revived again in the 11th century by another famous Platonist, Pletho, a name which is again accidentally almost identical to Plato. Freed of all vowels, Plato, Plotinus, and Pletho are simply identical names. It is assumed that Pletho revived ancient Platonism. Plato's manuscripts first appeared from oblivion just in the time of Pletho, i.e., in the 15th century [62]. Pletho organized the well-known Pletho Academy in Florence, an exact analogue of the ancient Platonic Academy [62]. He was the author of the famous utopia (both Plato and Pletho wrote utopias), the Laws, which, unfortunately, has not survived in complete form. But the text of Plato's Laws was preserved. Like Plato, the 15th-century Pletho put forward the idea of an ideal state, his theory being extremely close to that of Plato. "Imitating" them both, Plotinus also hoped that the emperor would help him found the town of Platonople in Campania (again in Italy), where he would introduce aristocratic and communal institutions "conceived by Plato" ([63], Vol. 4). The number of these strange "duplicates" in traditional chronology is quite large. One of the basic reasons for at least two variants of dating ancient and "medieval" documents is due to the Renaissance, when all the antique (now regarded as ancient) branches of science, philosophy, culture, painting, etc., were revived. It is assumed that the "ancient and brilliant Latin language" degraded at the beginning of the Middle Ages into a rude and awkward tongue which started acquiring, and did acquire, its former brilliancy only during the Renaissance. This "Renaissance" of the Latin language (as also that of ancient Greek} did not start any earlier than the 8th-9th century [64]. Starting with the l0th-1 lth century, the famous medieval trouveres came to make use of the stories now called by the historians "the masquerade of classical remembrances" [64]. In the 11th century, The History of Ulysses appeared, in which the well-known (and allegedly Homer's) fabula was retold from the "medieval approach" (speaking of knights, ladies, tournaments, etc.); but on the other hand, all the elements which would later be regarded as intrinsic



Problems of Historical Chronology 111
of any antique story had already been present ([64); see also the "antique" activity of the famous medieval poet Homer (Angilbert), who lived at Charlemagne's court in the 9th century. He was "the most important member of the scientific community at the Aachen court" ([63), Vol. 5). According to J. Demogeot:
"It was the end of the 12th or in the 13th century when ... the trouveres ... started to speak with a certain satisfaction, 'this story (i.e., the story of the Trojan Wa.r-A.F.) is not commonplace; nobody has yet written it'. For them, it was almost a traditional story" ([64], p. 110).3
As a matter of fact, the Franks regarded themselves as formerly having lived in Troy (!), whereas one author in the 7th century, Fredegarius Scholasticus, points out king Priain as a figure belonging to the medieval epoch (64). The Argonauts' expedition was also claimed to have coincided with the Trojan War when the conquering Crusaders, analogues of the Argonauts, rushed into the far regions of Asia. Alexander the Great flooded France with compliments (64). Speaking of the Trojan war, some medieval authors call Paris (Alexandros) a Parisian ([57), Comm. 76, p. 234) - French name. The medieval authors believed that the emperor Heraclius (traditionally assumed to have reigned from 610 to 641) had reigned with Princess Semiramis in the Land of the Hellenes ([57), p. 107). If we place biblical Semiramis into the 7th century, we shall diverge from traditional chronology to the extent of several hundreds of years.
A.V. Sterligov, the author of Ancient Plots in French Book Illustration at the End of the 14th-15th century [91), for example, reports the following:
"The greatest specialist in French medieval literature Gaston Paris wrote that the Middle Ages had never recognized themselves how far they had been separated fromm antiquity... "
"Anachronism was a conunon feature in the numerous universal chronicles, and ancient historians' renderings where biblical; ancient and national historical characters and the contemporaries were depicted similarly. The Trojan heroes cannot be distinguished from King Arthur's knights and warriors of the Hundred Years' War, while the contemporaries of Charles VI pronounce phrases which Livy put in the mouth of Gaius Capuleius, a tribune living in the 5th century B. C. . . . Ancient history, espe-cially that of Troy, from which the French nation allegedly originated, was included in the French chronicles. Hence, say, during the famous 1330 tournament, the Parisians
fought under the name of Priam and his 35 sons" ((91), p. 236).
"The deeds of biblical, ancient Greek and Roman heroes merged into one history of knighthood, continuing before the eyes of contemporaries" ((91], p. 237).
Under the pressure of tradition and all these strange things, the historians are forced to believe that
". . . the medieval idea of chronological sequence had all but been confused: Monks with crosses and censers took part in the funeral of Alexander the Great; Catiline
3Translated from the French-tr.



112 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
in the liturgy ... Orpheus was in their eyes Aeneas' contemporary, Sardanapalus a Greek king, Julian the Apostate a papal chaplain. All in that world took fantastic colouring according to the modem historians.. . . The most glaring anachronisms and the strangest fantasies neighboured peacefully" ((113), pp. 237-238).
All the above facts (and thousands of others!) today have been rejected as "preposterous". However, we have to bear in mind that their seeming preposterousness only arises from the chronology traditionally accepted at present. Long before the discovery of the allegedly "ancient" manuscript of the story of the Golden Ass, the "ass theme" had been widely exploited by medieval trouveres, and the "ancient" story (of Apuleius), which surfaced only during the Renaissance, resulted from the medieval sources. It is generally known that in the Middle Ages, much earlier than the "ancient" originals were discovered, all "ancient" stories had been exploited and embellished, with the alleged originals chronologically and evolutionally following their medieval predecessors [64). The oldest biography of Aristotle is dated to A .D. 1300 ([86), p. 29). Furthermore, only 20 percent of what is now called the Aristotelian corpus belongs to Aristotle himself ([86), p. 64). In the 15th century, it was the propagandist Georgios Scholarios who fervently popularized Aristotle's works.
8.15. Names and nicknames. Handwritten books
It is important that people in antiquity did not have names in the contemporary sense of the word but only had nicknames meaningful in the original tongue. The father of a Roman consul in 169 B.C. had 13 names, and his son 38. The nicknames characterized a man; the more remarkable traits of character, the more nicknames. Different chroniclers gave an emperor the different nicknames under which he was known. Moreover, they sometimes knew the same emperor under different nicknames. Pharaohs bore one name before the coronation, and another after it. Since they were crowned several times in different regions, the number of "names" grew sharply. For example, these nicknames were strong, light, and so forth.
"The csar Ivan III had the name Timothy; Vassily III was Gabriel ... ; the csarevitch Dmitry murdered in Uglich was Uar. One name was regal, and the other Christian" ((98], p. 22).
Traditional history believes that medieval names were different from ancient ones. However, textual analysis demonstrates that ancient names were quite often used in the Middle Ages. Nilus Ancyranus (who died in A.O. 450) wrote letters to the contemporary monks Apollodorus, Amphictyon, Atticus, Anaxagoras, Demophanes, Asclepiades, Aristocles, Aristarchus, Alcibiades, Antiochus, Apollos, and others [99]. An exceptionally large number of ancient names were used in the 12th- to 14th-century Byzantine Empire. Handwritten books have long survived the beginning of printing, successfully competing with the latter throughout Europe ([94), pp. 19, 25). With a few exceptions, almost all Irish literature of the 7th-8th century "only exists in manuscript form'' ([94), p. 28). Until 1500, 77 percent of all printed



§9 Astronomical and Mathematical Analysis of the Almagest 113
books were in Latin, since the Latin type was easier to make. However, the types of other languages were being introduced into the printing practice extremely slowly, because the technology of making special marks to denote accents, vowels, and so forth, was complicated. Therefore, for many years after printed books had appeared, "people copying Greek, Arabic and Jewish manuscripts did not remain unemployed.... " ((94], p. 57). Especially many
hand-written books of the book-printing era were made in Greece (!). It is possible that many of these manuscripts were later declared "ancient" . All of the above facts make many of the paleographic instances of dating doubtful. It turns out that many manuscripts were copied from books already printed ([94], p. 120). Greek monasteries were especially famous for their scribes who copied printed books! To detect such manuscripts, one should compare the textual errors with those in printed editions. Most probably, in copying a book, the errors were copied, too.
§9. Astronomical and Mathematical Analysis of the Almagest
9.1. Morozov's analysis of the first medieval editions of the Almagest
The basics of traditional chronology were established by analyzing written sources. If we reconsider the datings, freeing them from the a priori accepted hypotheses regarding the age of the documents, we shall not find any serious contradictions, the typical example being the new dating of Ptolemy's Almagest, carried out in [l]. Its most important part is the star catalogue: The star coordinates are given with an accuracy of 1/6°. To obtain so much accuracy, a clock with a minute hand is required; however, such a clock was not invented until the 12th-15th century. Morozov discovered that there was a reliable method to find out when the catalogue was actually made. Without going into details, we know that the stars' longitudes possess an annual precession of 50.2"; hence, by dividing the difference between today's longitudes and those indicated by Ptolemy by 50.2", we derive at the year when the catalogue was compiled. The result is shocking: All the longitudes given in the first Latin edition could have been recorded in the 16th century, i.e., when the book was published (now regarded as "ancient", and assigned to the 2nd century A.D.). This fact had not been noticed earlier, since the astronomers studied the Greek edition. Allegedly, the Greek text is the original one but was published later than the abovementioned Latin "translation". The (second) Greek edition supplies values for the longitudes, decreased by 20° ± 10', as if the stars had been observed in the 2nd century A.D, which is the traditional dating for the Almagest. A hypothesis arises that the Latin text was the original and the Greek the secondary one, but not vice versa as in the traditional approach. But it is also possible that, in the 16th century, the Almagest was published as a treatise for practical use and not as a historical document; and since the data had



114 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
become obsolete due to the precession and was of no purpose, the translator "refreshed" the catalogue by introducing the latest evidence. This objection can be eliminated by taking notice of the fact that the most important star coordinates were improved considerably in the later Greek edition, compared with the Latin one. Thus, by "restoring" Ptolemy's data as far as precession goes, the editor also improved it in other respects, which is not consistent with the conjecture that the Greek text was the original. It was noted in [1) that the following about the Almagest seemed to be very strange: (1) The extraordinary state of preservation of the star catalogue and the whole text. The Almagest is traditionally believed to have been rewritten many times since the 2nd century A.O. But, in copying, numerous errors must have been made, which is not confirmed, however. (2) The inexplicable accuracy of the catalogue and other observational data collected by Ptolemy and Hipparchus. (3) The use of the spring equinox as the basic point for measuring the longitudes, which could only be done by overcoming certain difficulties (one started resorting to it only since the 10th-16th century). (4) Dating the Latin edition (from the longitudinal precession) to the 16th century, agreeing with the date of the 2nd century A.O. (more precisely, by the rule of Antoninus Pius) given in the Almagest itself, is confirmed by the Greek text only if we take the value of the 16th-century precession, and is rejected if we replace it by a more precise one. (5) The "improvement" of the star catalogue of the Greek edition consisting of (a) more precise star coordinates, and (b) a systematic correction of their latitudes, obviously due to taking refraction into account (a late medieval discovery). (6) The systematic and considerable latitudinal shift discovered by the astronomer J. Bode, which puts any explanation of the Almagest 's traditional date to doubt. (7) The choice of the North Star as the first star of the catalogue, which neither could have been substantiated astronomically in the 2nd century (when another star was near the north galactic pole) nor have been consistent with the ecliptical coordinate system adopted in the Almagest, but quite understandable if the observations were made in the llth-16th century. (8) The inclusion of the star Achernar, which could not have been seen in Alexandria in the 2nd century A.O., but was already visible in the 15th-16th century. (9) The inclusion of Albrecht Diirer's engravings (astrographic charts) made only in 1515. As a matter of fact, many stars were localized on the map relative to these figures as being "in the leg of the constellation Pegasus" , and so forth. In my opinion, all these remarks made in (1] are very subjective and can be interpreted in different ways. We need some strong statistical method for dating the star catalogue. The difference between the Latin and Greek editions of the Almagest (see items 4 and 5) shows that we need to base our research on



§9 Astronomical and Mathematical Analysis of the Almagest 115
the ancient manuscripts of the Almagest. We base our work on the "canonical" version of the Almagest's star catalogue as presented in the fundamental work of Peters and Knobel ( Ptolemy 's Catalogue of Stars. A revision of the Almagest, Carnegie Institute, Washington, 1915). They investigated all the main manuscripts of the star catalogue. The attempts to date the catalogue on the basis of the displacement of individual stars such as Arcturus are not convincing. This motion is extremely slow, only several seconds a year. Recall that the astronomer Halley, on the contrary, calculated the value of Arcturus' proper motion, referring to star longitudes and the traditional dating of the Almagest to the 2nd century A .D. In reality, the values of the proper star displacements are small and of the order of the measuring errors; therefore, to date the catalogue reliably on the basis of individual displacements is complicated. (See details in the next section.) Dating catalogues by the deviation from modern star coordinates should be generally very accurate. For example, it is on the basis of a ea. 20° difference between the longitudes in the Greek and the Latin editions that traditional chronology makes a conclusion about their having been observed in the 2nd century A .D. It is tacitly assumed, however, that both the ancient and medieval astronomers counted longitudes from the same "basic point". To give just one example, the famous Theatrum Cometicum by the 17th-century author Stanislaw Lubieniecki should be "dated" to the 5th century B.c.! This absurd conclusion is due to Lubieniecki's having counted the longitudes off the first stars of Taurus, which led to a large difference with the modern longitudes, and which is not accepted today. There are very many similar examples [1]. Methods of the computation of longitudes simply were diverse in the Middle Ages, and each author took different stars as initial reference points, resulting in a difference in the longitudes, and therefore not at all explained by precession.
9.2. On the statistical characteristics of the Almagest. The structure of the star catalogue
Sections 2-5 contain the results of a 1986 work by the author and G.V. Nosovsky:
The history of the Almagest is well known. It is assumed traditionally that its star catalogue was made by Ptolemy in A.D. 138 from his own observations in Alexandria, though the fact that the stars were observed by Ptolemy himself was denied by many researchers (e.g., in (102]). R. Newton's book presents some of the latest and quite fundamental research on the Almagest. Therefore, we only touch upon the history of the discovery of the catalogue in medieval Europe. The catalogue's manuscript got into Rome from Byzantium in ea. 1450 (recall which 1453 is the year when Constantinople fell). It is assumed which its first translation into Latin was made by Georgios Trapezuntius in 1460 and that it was published with Diirer's maps only in 1528 in Venice (see [108],



116 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
pp. 10-11). There are data indicating that the famous scientist and his contemporary, I. Regiomontanus, investigated the catalogue in 1464, which was published only in 1541 ([108], p. 220). Here is the list of the first editions of the Almagest: 1496 in Venice(?), abbreviated by Regiomontanus and G. Purbachi ([108), p. 218); 1515 in Venice, Liechtenstein's edition in Latin; 1528, in Venice, T:rapezuntius' edition in Latin, with the star longitudes corresponding to those of the 16th century; 1537, in Basel, Trapezuntius' edition in Greek, which he called the "first" edition, with the ancient star longitudes. The catalogue's structure was as follows: Stars are divided as in the constellations, each description consisting of four columns with the positions described as, for example, "in Pegasus' head", ecliptical longitudes, latitudes and magnitudes (with brightness being in inverse proportion to the magnitude). Sometimes, the description of a constellation is followed by that of the stars near it, but which are not in the corresponding figure. Today, all the stars are formally included into the corresponding constellations. We now discuss each of the columns.
The position of a star in a constellation. This column is least informative. As a matter of fact, neither constellations nor the descriptions of the stars' positions had ever been standardized in the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, they were understood as simply being a certain region in the astrographic charts under a constellation; however, it was essential for the medieval astronomers that the stars should be well consistent with a particular figure. The forms of the constellations in medieval astronomical textbooks seem fantastic, and it is hard to understand which particular configuration of stars was meant (see examples in (l]). The first standard representations of the sky were given in Diirer's prints, published together with the Almagest in 1537, though they were not completely identified with the modern star atlas. The description of the stars in the constellations did not become standard after Diirer's maps either: The Almagest, Copernicus', and Tycho Brahe's catalogues are all different. It is only in the 17th century that the first sufficiently precise classification systems appeared, which made it possible to identify with certainty the stars mentioned in ancient catalogues with modern stars (i.e., with stars listed in modern catalogues.
Star coordinates. Two star coordinate systems were known in the Middle Ages, namely, ecliptical and equatorial systems. From now on, we refer the reader to [102] with respect to all problems of star astronomy. Beginning with the 17th century, only equatorial coordinates have been used in catalogues. Ecliptical coordinates are only seen in the Almagest and in 16th-century catalogues, the last of them being by Tycho Brahe. The reason for this is very simple: Equatorial coordinates are much easier to measure (to a greater accuracy at that) than ecliptical ones. On the other hand, at the time of Ptolemy and from the 15th to the 17th century, astronomers believed ecliptical coordinates to be "eternal", i.e., suitable at once for all epochs, with the latitudes being invariable in time, and the star longitudes varying at a constant rate



§9 Astronomical and Mathematical Analysis of the Almagest 117
(meaning the longitudinal precession). Therefore, the two principal questions discussed by astronomy in the 15-17th century were: Do stars possess their own movement, or is the configuration of the starry sky invariable, and what is the rate of precession? Both answers given by Ptolemy are wrong. He answered in the negative in the first case, though Arcturus' own movement was discovered in the mid-18th century. He determined the rate as 1° per 100 years, its modern value being 49.8s a year, i.e., 1.4° each 100 years. It is curious to see Tycho Brahe assert that Copernicus allegedly assumed that the
precession was 1° a century, and Tycho Brahe ascribed the first refining of the figure to himself (see [104], pp. 377-396). The division value for star coordinates in the Almagest is 10 minutes. More precisely, one-sixth of a degree, since the Almagest coordinates were given in degrees and their fractions with an extremely inconvenient (from the modern standpoint) method for the latter notation (e.g., see [102), [108]). The coordinate accuracy does not correspond to this value (see the analysis in [102] and in the following). Ptolemy declared that he had directly measured the ecliptical coordinates of all stars by means of an astrolabe, which is a rather complicated procedure [102]. Copernicus only refined the positions of several stars. Tycho Brahe rewrote the catalogue again, using the system of base stars and thus achieving the accuracy of one minute. His catalogue contains about 700 stars (against Ptolemy's 1022); however, after it had been published in the 16th century, the Almagest completely lost its scientific importance.
Magnitude of a star. The scale of magnitudes in Ptolemy's Almagest is made up of integers from unity (corresponding to the brightest stars) to six (corresponding to the faintest ones). He stated that he had observed all stars up to the sixth magnitude, which seems improbable from today's point of view, since many stars of magnitude 3 to 5 cannot be identified with them, whereas some of magnitude 6 can be identified at once. If we compare the magnitudes of Ptolemy's stars with the modern ones, we shall see that the magnitudes 1 to 2 were always determined correctly, whereas he often made mistakes in the interval of the magnitudes 3 to 6. We now go on to the problem of dating the observations of the stars which formed the basis for the Almagest star catalogue. Its traditional dating is founded on Ptolemy's statement that the catalogue had been compiled in the second year of the rule of the emperor Pius. According to the Scaliger-Petavius chronology, this is the year A.O. 138, though the name "Pius" was common to some other Roman emperors, for example, the famous Maximilian I Pius (14931519), who reigned just at the time of the first Almagest editions (Fig. 9(2)). However, even Delambre noticed that the average error in the star longitudes was about 35 minutes; therefore, the catalogue supplies the coordinates not as they were in A.O. 138 but in ea. in A.D. 60. J. Bode speaks of the year 63, whereas F. Peters and E. Knobel of the year 58. In fact, the error variance for the longitudes of approximately 1,000 stars is about 402 minutes. Hence, the average
error in longitude is a random variable with variance u2 = 402/1000 = 1.6'.



118 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Since they must be distributed according to N(O, 1), the admissible average error in the longitude should not exceed 5 minutes, which permits us to determine the epoch to which the catalogue dates to the accuracy of 5-6 years. Thus, in the form it was published in Basel in 1537, the Almagest could not have been made from the observational data of A.O. 138. This last important remark by Delambre led to the hypothesis that Ptolemy had not observed the stars by himself, but rather updated the Hipparchus catalogue to A.O. 138, the latter being dated to 130 B .c. Meanwhile, making use of the incorrect precession value, he actually reduced the catalogue to A.O. 60 instead of A.O. 138. The authors of (105), (106), and (108] were of the same opinion. The important work [102] is devoted just to the proof of this hypothesis. Note that almost all of its conclusions are based on the assumption that the Almagest was written by an ancient astronomer. However, R. Newton's main argument based on the comparison of degree fractional part distribution for latitude and longitude of a star is not related to chronology [102]. In this connection, the investigation of the distributions of degree fractional parts in Ptolemy's catalogue, carried out by Newton, only permits us to state the fact that the catalogue was obtained from the original and is based on direct observations by adding an integral (possibly, negative!) number of one degree and forty minutes. If, following [108], we assume that the Almagest is related to A.O. 58, and if we take precession into account, then the longitudinal shift through an integral multiple of one degree and forty minutes takes us to the following values for the epochs of observation, namely, ... , -207, -134, -62, 10, 92, 154, 227, 299, 371, 443, 515, 586, 660, 732, 805, 877, 950, 1022, 1094, 1166, 1239, 1311, 1383, 1456, 1528, 1600, ... (years B.C. are indicated by a minus sign). The conclusion of Newton is that the Ptolemy star catalogue had been "corrected" according to the precession used by Hipparchus. On the basis of statistical investigations, he asserts that Ptolemy was a falsifier. The same thought was even expressed in the book's title, namely, The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy, and in the titles of many of the book's sections. For example, he speaks of equinoxes and solstices allegedly observed by Ptolemy, the fabricated solstice of 431 B.c., observations allegedly made by Ptolemy to determine the ecliptic's slope and Alexandria's latitude, four fabricated lunar eclipse "triads", the proof of a forgery, a swindler, falsifications of calculations and falsifications with oversights, falsification of data, falsification of the Venus data and exterior planet data, and so forth. Newton writes that all the observations made by Ptolemy himself, so far as they can be checked, turned out to be a forgery, and that many observations ascribed to other astronomers were also part of the falsification. It then becomes clear that none of Ptolemy's statements can be accepted unless they have been confirmed by authors absolutely independent of his data. Be it history or astronomy, all research based on the Almagest should be performed again. Thus, Newton completes his thought, Ptolemy is not the outstanding astronomer of antiquity but a more unusual figure: a most successful swindler in the history of science (see [102]).



§9 Astronomical and Mathematical Analysis of the Almagest 119
However, this estimation of Ptolemy's work by a well-known astronomer of modern times is only based on the hypothesis of the Almagest's ancient origin. The attitude toward Ptolemy may become quite different if it turns out that we are dealing with a text written in the 10-16th century. We have already noted earlier that almost all of Newton's conclusions depend on the a priori dating of the catalogue to about the year A.D. 1, or the first two centuries before and after. Our goal is the Almagest's analysis based solely on the star catalogue itself and the contemporary idea of the starry sky. Some steps in this direction are made in the sequel. We once again stress the importance of Newton's research and would only like to complete it by suggesting another interpretation. Below, we have collected the data regarding the errors in the star catalogue.
9.3. The accuracy of the Almagest's star coordinates
Here, we discuss the accuracy of the Almagest's star coordinates and the way Ptolemy measured them. Recall that the division value was 10 arc min., or one-sixth degree. Much work on identifying the stars in the Almagest catalogue with the stars of modern time was done by Bayer, Flamsteed, Bode, Baily, Peters, Knobel, and others in the 16-20th century. This was a very nontrivial job (for details, see [108], which gives a large number of versions of identification, with different authors identifying the same stars differently in the different Almagest manuscripts). Since not all the Almagest stars have been identified with certainty, we only consider the zodiacal stars. The zodiacal constellations were especially important for ancient and medieval astronomy and astrology. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that their coordinates were measured more often than the coordinates of other stars. Hence, the coordinates of the zodiacal stars apparently make a homogeneous sample, whereas the sample of all the Almagest star coordinates is inhomogeneous, in particular, due to the different accuracy of determining longitudes in different latitudes (however, there may be other reasons, too; e.g., astrological, more important stars probably having been measured in a more thorough manner). The Almagest's zodiac consists of 350 stars. The average error in longitude is zero if A.O. 60 is taken as the observation epoch (more precisely, this is the epoch to which the catalogue is related, with it possibly being much different from the time when the actual observations were made; see above). The aver
age error in latitude is -2.4°, the sample variance in the longitudes o-'f = 472
min. (recall that 1°= 60 min.). Ten values exceeding 130 minutes were not
taken into account. The sample variance in latitude was o-l = 262 min., with
one value of 136 minutes being rejected. We can draw two conclusions from comparing these and the division value of 10 minutes in the Almagest. Apparently, the longitudes were recalculated after actual observations. In fact, since the accuracy of the longitudes is much worse than that of the latitudes (remember that this difference cannot be due to the proximity of the stars to the poles, considering only the zodiacal stars with latitudes within



120 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
20°), this circumstance is another argument for the recalculation of the longitude. In antiquity and the Middle Ages, calculations involved complex literal designations of integers and especially fractional parts, constructed from fractional units denoted in the same way as their denominator, but primed (see [102], [105]). It is natural that, in each recalculation, errors arose and the accuracy fell. The variances of the catalogue errors are not consistent with the division value of 10 minutes. It turns out that, as a rule, Ptolemy's mistakes consisted of several divisions at once, which confirms Morozov's standpoint that the Almagest coordinates were obtained by a method quite usual for the Middle Ages and, possibly, for antiquity, namely, by measuring equatorial coordinates and subsequently recalculating them into ecliptical ones, done graphically on large atlases or special terrestrial globes with grids of both coordinates (see [1], Vol. 4, pp. 201, 264-265). However, it is assumed traditionally that Ptolemy observed ecliptical coordinates directly by means of a complex device, the astrolabe, adjusting it by the sun ii:i the afternoon, and by calculating the correction for the shift of its plane due to the earth's rotation by a clepsydra. If we accept Morozov's viewpoint, then we derive at a natural and simple account for these "strange" average error graphs in determining the zodiacal star coordinates as the longitudinal function (stars are grouped with respect to their longitude, and the average error in longitude and latitude is calculated in each group; see the graphs in [108]). The graphs resemble two sine curves shifted with respect to each other approximately by one-fourth of the period. The fact can be easily explained by a small error (within 0.5°) in specifying the ecliptic's slope to the equator on the terrestrial globe (see also the discussion in [1], Vol. 4). Thus, the coordinates of the Almagest stars are, most probably, a total of the following: (1) Measuring equatorial star coordinates, (2) recalculating equatorial into ecliptical coordinates graphically, and (3) adding a certain constant difference to the longitudes without altering the latitudes (possibly, it was done several times). In connection to the latter item, we once again stress the important investigation by Newton of the degree fractional parts distribution for the catalogue coordinates, showing that an integral multiple (possibly negative) of degrees and 40 minutes was added to the original longitudinal values (see [1021). This operation could have made the catalogue more ancient and shift it from the 10-15th century toward the turn of the first millennium.
9.4. The problem of dating the Almagest from the individual stars' proper motion
We now dwell on the problem of dating the Almagest based on the individual stars' proper motion. Similar hypotheses were repeatedly made. We distinguished all those stars from the Almagest whose own motion is greater than one second a year, at least with respect to one of the coordinates 01900, 61900, where o and 6 are equatorial coordinates, right ascension and declination. The



§9 Astronomical and Mathematical Analysis of the Almagest 121
subscript indicates the epoch in which the coordinates were measured, i.e., the year in which the spring equinox was the origin of the coordinates. Note that the star's own motion in a historical period can be regarded as rectilinear and uniform. It turned out that there were nine such stars: o in the constellation Bootes
(= Arcturus), o in Canis Major (= Sirius), o in Canis Minor (= Procyon), i of Perseus, T of Cetus, 0 2 of Eridanus, ; of Serpens, T/ of Cassiopeia, and a of Centaurus, the latter having been rejected because it is too southern {it is hard to observe southern stars, because they do not rise high enough over the horizon in the Northern Hemisphere), and it is given in the Almagest with an error greater than 5°, which corresponds to its own motion in 5,000 years! Thus, eight stars remained, the first three of them being of magnitude one; therefore, their identification leaves no doubt, which cannot be said of the other five, since a convenient star from the Almagest can only be selected on the basis of the similarity of the star coordinates. In other words, we have to take the nearest Almagest stars. These stars turned out to be actually identified with the modern ones, only because they were the nearest stars for certain ones from the catalogue and are visible by the naked eye. We shall make this important thought more precise. The 17th- to 18th-century astronomers were forced to identify many Almagest stars just in this way. Knowing their own motion, they calculated their position, or coordinates, with respect to the turn of the first millennium, and then looked for the nearest stars in the Almagest. Thus, the Almagest stars got their names. It is obvious that the hypothesis about the Almagest being a document dated to the start of the Christian era resides in the identification procedure itself. The rejection of this a priori hypothesis can lead us to quite different identifications. Finally, the star identification procedure on the basis of the coordinate similarity, first substantially depends on the a priori catalogue dating and, second, is not at all unique (e.g., in the case where at once several stars are equally eligible in position and magnitude). We stress once again that, since we here consider the stars being displaced noticeably with respect to a fixed star net, to compare them with the Ptolemy catalogue, we must know the time of the observations. Thus, the star 0 2 in Eridanus was identified differently by different researchers (see (108] for the table of different identifications). Moreover, the star with which it is now traditional to identify 0 2 in Eridanus (No. 779 in the Baily numeration, with Ptolemy not having given a consecutive numeration) has several versions. The thing is that different printed books and manuscripts supply different values for its coordinates. We consider the two basic values due to Baily (see [106], chosen on the basis of investigating printed books) and due to F. Peters and E. Knobel (see [108], chosen on the basis of the Almagest manuscripts). The situation is similar to the coordinates of Procyon and its identification, existing in two versions of the printed books, and of Baily (see [106]), and in some manuscripts and [108). Thus, the question "who is who" in the Ptolemy catalogue is absolutely



122 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
nontrivial for some stars, and its solution is substantially dependent on dating the Almagest a priori.
A point estimation of the time when it was observed by the least-squares methods was found for each of the considered stars. Namely, the perpendicular was dropped from the position of an Almagest star to the trajectory of the corresponding star's own motion in today's sky, and the year was found when the moving star was at the foot of this perpendicular, for which ecliptical coordinates were recalculated into equatorial ones, and reduced to the 1900 equinox. Meanwhile, the Almagest epoch was taken as A.O. 60 (see [105], (106]). We now list the obtained estimates: (1) A.O. 800 for Arcturus, (2) A.O. 500 for Sirius, (3) A.O. 1850 for Procyon (according to Baily) or A.O. 1450 (according to Peters and Knobel), (4) 2000 B.C. for i in Perseus, (5) 150 B.C. for
Tin Cetus, (6) A.O. 1800 for 0 2 in Eridanus (according to Baily) or 150 B.C. (according to Peters and Knobel), (7) 1400 B.C. for; in Serpens, and (8) 100 B.C. for T/ in Cassiopeia. However, note that the roughest estimation of the accuracy of these dates is 600 years. It is obtained if the division value in the Almagest, i.e., 10 minutes, or 600 seconds, is divided by the rate of the star's own motion, or about 1 second a year. But, if we recall the Almagest star coordinate error variance (see above), then this value should be increased at least twice, though the low accuracy of the obtained estimates can already be seen from their scattering. The trajectories of the above eight stars own motion in the equatorial coordinates 01900, 61900 are represented in Fig. 20 (1-7) and 21, the positions in 1900 are at the point where the axes meet. All bright stars {up to magnitude 6.5), falling into a given region, are also represented. The figure near a star is its magnitude, and its number in the catalogue of (107] is also given. Figures 20(5) and 20(6) explicitly demonstrate that the identifications of the moving stars with those from the Almagest are substantially dependent on its dating: If we assume that it was made, say, in the Middle Ages, then No. 779 is most probably associated with No. 1362 (or No. 1363) from the bright-star catalogue (107), whereas No. 265 from the Almagest with No. 35k Ser (Nos. of the Almagest stars are given according to Baily; see (106), [108)). Thus, dating the Almagest from the own motion of individual stars with the use of their traditional identification with the Ptolemy stars can still be false even if we neglect the accuracy of the datings obtained, since the traditional identifications were made in the 18-20th century, involving the rate of the star's own motion and the Almagest's a priori dating to the 1st century A.O., which can be seen especially well in Fig. 20(5). We can find identifications corresponding to the medieval, and not at all ancient, observation epoch for both versions of the coordinates of No. 779 in the Almagest, which is in Eridanus according to Baily, and No. 1362 (or 1463) from the bright-star catalogue according to Peters and Knobel [107]. Our first conclusion is an inconsistency between the characteristics of the star catalogue itself and the statements contained in Ptolemy's astronomical

they are not consistent with the catalogue's error distribution. Obviously, a more traditional method for measuring equatorial coordinates by means of wall circles was employed, and only then equatorial coordinates were recalculated into ecliptical ones on a special terrestrial globe. Analysis of the distribution of the fractional parts in the catalogue coordinates and error variances has shown that the longitudes were recalculated after the measurement, which contradicts Ptolemy's statement that the catalogue

contains direct measurements (for a description of some other incoherences, see (102)). Second, attempting to date the catalogue via the motion of individual stars, we discovered that for faint stars of magnitudes 3-6 which move appreciably, it was necessary to analyze the identifications of the stars of today's sky with the Almagest's, since the traditional procedure already involved the data regarding the stars' own motion and the a priori dating the catalogue as belonging to the start of the Christian era. As far as the bright stars which move appreciably are concerned, the dates from A .D. 500 to 1800 are obtained. This enormous variance and, therefore, the low accuracy of estimation, are related to the fact that the rate of the stars' own motion is too small compared to the errors in the Almagest coordinates. Note that only five stars moving fast are included in the Almagest. The author and V.V. Kalashnikov, G.V. Nosovsky, V.M. Zolotarev, and I.S. Shiganov started investigating not with individual stars but with the whole collection of the moving ones for the purpose of calculating the date when they were observed on the basis of their totality. The results of the statistical investigation were published in the paper by A.T. Fomenko, V.V. Kalashnikov and G.V. Nosovsky, "When was Ptolemy's star catalogue in the Almagest compiled in reality? Statistical analysis". Acta Applicandae

128 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Mathematicae 17: 203-229, 1989. This work was devoted to describing a new statistical and geometrical procedure for dating ancient star catalogues by considering numerical data contained in these catalogues and the known real configurations of stars on the celestial sphere. The method was tested on several star catalogues whose dates are well known (Tycho Brahe, etc.) and on several artificially generated star catalogues. Then the same method was applied to the Almagest. The results obtained do not confirm the traditional dating of the Almagest (2nd century A.D. or 2nd century B.c.) but shift its dating to the Arabian epoch, i.e., to 600-1300 A.D.
The authors plan to publish the details of this research in a separate book. Now, some concluding remarks about Halley's discovery.
9.5. Halley's discovery of the stars' proper motion and the Almagest
It is traditionally believed that the stars' proper motion was first discovered by Halley in 1718. Speaking of this fact, Kulikovsky says:
"Comparing the positions of Arcturus, Sirius and Aldebaran with their positions in the Hipparchus catalogue, E. Halley (1656-1742) discovered their proper motion, and that their ecliptical longitudes changed by 601, 451, and 61 in the last 1850 years, assuming that the catalogue was already dated as having been written in the 2nd
century B .C." (namely, 1718 + 132 = 1850 years-A.F.) ([110], p. 219).
The first related question then is how he could have discovered Aldebaran 's proper motion. It is because Aldebaran has shifted in the assumingly elapsed time (allegedly, ea. 2,000 years) by 6', as we now know on the basis of modern knowledge. However, the division value both in the Ptolemy and Hipparchus catalogues was 10'! It is useless to discuss the phenomenon if this value does not exceed the accuracy of a measuring device, let alone the fact that the actual accuracy of measurements was much worse than 10'. How then could Halley have discovered Aldebaran's proper motion if it had shifted by only 6' in 2,000 years? Another question arises: What motion did Halley ascribe to Arcturus and Sirius? Kulikovsky reports:
"In 1738, Cassini (1677-1756) precisely determined Arcturus' proper motion, having compared his measurements with Richet's observations (?-1696) sixty years before" ([110], p. 219).
Therefore, Halley did not determine Arcturus' proper motion "precisely". Nor could he have determined Sirius' motion when it moved at a slower rate. The natural and, to some degree, unexpected question arises: Did Halley, at least in principle, discover the stars' proper motion? It will be appropriate to inform the reader that Halley was not at all the first one to pose the question whether stars were moving, the problem having been animatedly discussed in the 15-16th century. Moreover, within the framework of traditional chronology, this problem was investigated as early as antiquity, or approximately 2,000 years before Halley. Tradition assumes that this important problem was discussed by Ptolemy who came to the conclusion that all the stars were stationary (which we know is wrong). Thus, posing the problem cannot be ascribed to Halley.



§9 Astronomical and Mathematical Analysis of the Almagest 129
Why did astronomers not compare the positions of the stars in the sky to the Almagest for the purpose of discovering their proper motion? As a matter of fact, the very idea of such a computation, or comparison, also dates back to Ptolemy and, therefore, was not at all new to a medieval astronomer. Such attempts would have been natural and could have led to the conclusion that the stars were moving: At least, the anomalous scattering in Ptolemy's star positions could have been taken as the stars' proper motion. We have already noted that the Almagest's accuracy is not consistent with the catalogue division value. Arcturus' and Sirius' motion could have been determined by the early 17th-century astronomers (100 years before Halley), as well as by Halley himself, on the basis of Tycho Brahe's catalogue, its accuracy being 1' and dating to 1582-1588 if we compare it with the Almagest. Imagine that we are 16th-18th-century astronomers. Only the following two points of view are possible. (1) Assume that we are of Scaliger's and Petavius' opinion and associate the second year of Emperor Antonine Pius' rule, the date of the Almagest's observation time, with A .D. 138, in which case we should discover the stars' proper motion, resorting to the allegedly ancient, about 1,500-year-old catalogue, at least proceeding from Arcturus, the brightest star in the sky. However, these natural attempts were not fixed by the traditional history of astronomy in the 15-16th century, though they would have to make us conjecture that Arcturus was movmg. (2) Assume that we regard the Almagest as a comparatively recent document, say, of the 10th-15th century, or as a source with unknown dating, in which case the attitude toward the book would be quite different. If this catalogue is assumed to be medieval, then the Almagest's inaccuracy, which is well known to the professional astronomers, and, moreover, the large division value would simply not permit us to make such a recalculation (which could not be made either if the catalogue date was unknown). Since the history of astronomy reports nothing of the 16th- and 17th-century astronomers' attempts to discover the stars' proper motion on the basis of the Almagest, we are forced to conclude that they did not regard it as a sufficiently ancient document. Thus, a serious 16th- or 17th-century scientist should have made the conclusion that the accuracy of the coordinates in the Almagest did not permit him to discover the stars' proper motion if he regarded it as a medieval source. On the other hand, if the Almagest had been regarded as an ancient document, say, dating back to the 2nd century A.O., then the idea itself of using it to discover the stars' proper motion would have been very simple. It should be remembered that the problem of the stars' proper motion was important in ancient times. It seems completely improbable for the idea to be new in Halley's time. We shall now try to explain why the conclusion regarding the proper motion of certain stars (e.g., of Arcturus or Sirius) could be made in Halley's time, though more or less precise values for their rate could not be found.



130 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
The first precise star catalogue to the accuracy of 1' was made by Tycho Brahe in 1582-1588. Arcturus' and Sirius' displacements in the 100 years after Halley were about 3' and a little more than 2', respectively. With a precise catalogue of the star positions as was available in the 18th century, Arcturus' and Sirius' proper motion could already be suspected, though the catalogue's accuracy could not have as yet permitted one to determine the rates of motion. It turns out that such a catalogue was indeed available in the early 18th century. It was made by Flamsteed and was actually employed by Halley even before its publication (with Halley having taken some incomplete version from Isaac Newton, who was just investigating chronology).
Thus, in our opinion, Halley compared Flamsteed's and Brahe 's catalogues, and made the conclusion regarding the existence of Arcturus', Sirius', and Aldebaran's proper motion.
Meanwhile, Aldebaran 's motion indicated by Halley obtains the natural explanation: He made use of the incomplete variants of Flamsteed's catalogue in which the Aldebaran information was given erroneously. Flamsteed regarded his catalogue as not yet ready for publication at that time. It is known that Halley made Aldebaran's position more precise for the purpose (in his letter to A. Sharp on September 13, 1718; see (109)).
Why then did Halley refer to Ptolemy's Almagest as the basis for his computations, and not to Tycho Brahe's? Obviously, in Halley's time, the traditional Almagest's date, A .D. 138, "calculated" by Scaliger and Petavius had already been canonized. To give his discovery more weight, Halley referred to the Almagest, and not to Tycho Brahe, for the simple reason that the star displacements discovered by him then looked more impressive. Calculating Arcturus' displacement from Brahe's catalogue, Halley obtained only three minutes, compared with the nominal accuracy of one minute in the former catalogue, whereas, repeating the procedure for Ptolemy's catalogue of (allegedly) A .D. 138, he naturally obtained a more substantial shift of about one degree. It is apparent that Halley compared the shift with the Almagest's nominal accuracy of ten minutes, neglecting the problem of the actual accuracy of the coordinates of the Almagest's catalogue.
This reasoning makes us think once again that the Almagest had not yet been regarded (in the 16th century) as an ancient, about 1,500-year-old document and its "antiquity" was assumed known and canonized only early in the 18th century.
Each of the above facts can also be separately "explained" within the traditional chronology framework, but, taken all together, they most probably indicate that the Almagest was written between the 10th and the 16th century. Still, in contrast to Morozov, I do not at all believe that the Almagest was fabricated. More than that, in my opinion, at any rate, its first edition is an original created in the 15th-16th century for immediate scientific purposes (see the substantiation below).



§10 Archaeological Dating Methods 131
§10. Archaeological Dating Methods
10.1. Classical excavation methods
Certainly, the reader may ask how things are with the other methods of dating classical historical sources and monuments. Modern archaeologists painfully speak of "ignorant diggers" of the earlier centuries, who, hunting for valuables, mercilessly disfigured numerous monuments.
"When the artifacts were delivered to the Rumyantsev Museum (excavations of 1851-1854-A.F.), they were, in the true sense of the word, a shapeless heap, without any indication from which excavated hill they came . . . The grandiose excavations of 1851-1854 ... will be long deplored by science" ([65), 12-13).
At present, excavation methods have become more sophisticated; unfortunately, it is quite rarely that they apply to excavations of ancient historical spots, all of them having already been "touched" by earlier "diggers". Here are, in a nutshell, the archaeological dating basics. Greek vessels of the Mycenaean culture were discovered in the tombs hailing from the Egyptian 18th and 19th dynasties. The dynasties and culture were, therefore, regarded by the archaeologists as having been simultaneous events. The same vessels, or "similar ones", were found along with clasps of special form in Mycenae, and similar pins in Germany, near burial urns. A similar urn was found in Germany, and in this urn a pin of a new form. A similar pin was then also found in Sweden, in the so-called hill of King Bjorn. Thus, this hill was dated to the 18th and 19th dynasties of Egypt [66]. It was meanwhile discovered that the Bjorn hill
"... could not belong to Bjorn, king of the Vikings, and was made well two thousand years before" ([66), pp. 55-56).
It is not clear what should be understood by the "similarity" of the findings; hence, all these, and similar, methods are based on unlimited subjectivism and traditional chronology. The newly-found artifacts are compared with "similar" finds dated earlier on the traditional basis. A change in this "scale" will automatically alter the ·chronology of recent archaeological findings. The excavations at Pompeii can be a good illustration of the problems which arise in dating archaeological material. The medieval author of the 15thcentury Sannazaro Jacopo wrote that, as he approached Pompeii, its towers, buildings, theatres, and temples became visible, not touched by centuries!? ([47], p. 31). But it is impossible from the traditional point of view, because Pompeii is regarded to have been buried by the volcanic eruption of A.O. 79. Traditional history insists that Pompeii's ruins were completely covered by sand for many centuries till the 18th century. Hence, the modern archaeologists are forced to treat this citation from Sannazaro thus:
"... in the 15th century, certain of the Pompeii buildings became visible in a layer of sand ... " ([47), p. 31).
Therefore, it is assumed that Pompeii was again (after the 15th century)



132 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
"covered by sand", since its remains were discovered only in 1748 and Herculaneum's in 1711 ([47], pp. 31-32). The excavations were barbaric. It is now hard to determine the extent of damages caused by the vandalism of the time. If a picture seemed not to be very pretty, then it was broken into pieces, thrown away as waste. Separate letters were taken off the bronze inscriptions of marble tables. Souvenirs for tourists were fabricated of sculptural fragments, sometimes even with the images of saints, certain of the ''fabrications" possibly being originals [68]. There were obviously medieval pictures on Pompeii's walls, such as a hangman under a hood, a warrior with a cuirass, helmet and visor (!), and so on ([47], pp. 210-211 ). Surgical instruments indistinguishable from medieval ones, and of extremely high quality, were found. An emperor with the double name Valens-Nero (translation due to Morozov) was mentioned on one of the official inscriptions, though, according to traditional history, these are two different men separated by ea. 300 years [47]. The 20th-century archaeologists and historians paid much attention to a particular strange process. Most of the ancient monuments in the last 200300 years, starting when continuous observations began for some reason or other, were destroyed much more than during the previous centuries or even millennia. In particular, they include the Parthenon, Colosseum, theatre of Epidaurus, Venetian buildings, Indian temples, and others. "Modern" industry is usually to blame, but nobody investigated thoroughly the influence of "modern" civilization on stone buildings. It is natural to suggest that they were not as ancient as asserted traditionally, and were being destroyed at a natural rate.
10.2. Numismatics
"Numismatics as a science was formed comparatively late. The intermediate stage from simple collections to scientific research methods ... was presumably the very end of the 18th century" ([100], pp. 13-14).
The numismatics scale and dating and the relative chronological ordering of ancient coins on the time axis are wholly based on traditional chronology regarded a priori as known, and they were established earlier on the basis of written evidence.
"Material was gathered from almost 200 years of nwnismatics in the collectors' hands, but no attempts to study it critically were made" ([100), pp. 13-14).
Most ancient coins were supplied with abbreviated formulas, or anagrams with ambiguous dating, and without detailed inscriptions. The dates on coins were sometimes based on calendars whose relation to the counting of the modern year is still suitable to a special study. It is assumed that, from the 8th until the mid-13th century, the medieval gold coins of Rome practically vanished in Italy. However, there were many much more ancient Roman gold coins. Our conjecture is as follows: these ancient coins are in reality the medieval



§10 Archaeological Dating Methods 133
gold coins, and minting them in medieval Rome possibly had not stopped. But the latest chronologists have shifted these medieval coins to the past.
10.3. The dendrochronological method
Certain physical procedures are applied to the dating, for example, of dendrochronology or the radiocarbon method. However, dendrochronological scales were established to account only for several hundred years backwards, which does not permit us to date ancient European buildings.
"Many European scientists employed dendrochronology for dating.... But, it soon became clear that the matter was not so simple. Trees in European forests are no more than 3CX>-400 years old.... The leaf-bearing wood is hard to &n&lyze. Its blU1Ted rings very reluctantly speak of past times. . . . Reliable archaeological data turn out to be unexpectedly insufficient" ([69), p. 103).
American dendrochronology based on the Douglas fir, bristlecone, and yellow pine is much better off, but deals with an area far away from the "areas of antiquity" ([69], p. 103). Moreover, there are always many completely unaccountable factors, such as local climatic conditions, soil composition, humidity variations, landscape, and others, which alter the graphs of the annual ring thickness essentially ([69], pp. 100-101). It is important that the construction of dendrochronological scales was carried out on the basis of already existing traditional chronology {[69], p. 105); therefore, any change in the chronology of documents will alter the dendrochronological scales. The methods of dating by determining column deformation, river sediment accumulation rate, stone building surface layer weathering rate, sound propagation rate in bones, and others, remain extremely inaccurate and depend on traditional chronology assumed a priori as known, with the principal difficulty being the absence of a reliable absolute scale and the impossibility to "calibrate a method" for dating ancient artifacts.
10.4. The radiocarbon method
The most popular is the radiocarbon method claiming the independent absolute dating of antique monuments. However, as radiocarbon dates were accumulated, most serious difficulties arose; in particular,
". . . one had to think of another problem. The radiation piercing the atmosphere varies for many space reasons, the quantity of radiocarbon therefore changing time. It is then necessary to find a technique which would pennit us to take them into account. Besides, ... huge amounts of carbon from burning charcoal, anthracite, oil, pect, shale and their by-products are continuously thrown into the atmosphere. What influence does this have on the rise of the radioactive isotope quantity? To achieve a method for detennining the true age exactly, one has to compute the complicated co1Tections reflecting the changes in the composition of the atmosphere during the last milleIU1ium. Along with certain difficulties of technological nature, these doubts led to uncertainty regarding the accuracy of a lot of datings achieved by the radiocarbon method" ([69], p. 72).



134 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Its inventor W. Libby has been absolutely sure of the correctness of traditional historical datings:
"Throughout Roman and Egyptian history, we have no disagreements. We haven't had very many measurements to make (!-A.F.) because in general the archaeologists know the dates better than we can measure them, and it is usually as a favour that they give us samples (which are by the way, burned in the measuring process-A.F.)" ((70}, p. 24).
This confession is significant, because traditional chronology revealed its difficulties particularly for the regions and epochs with only a few datings by the method. As to the small number of test measurements for antique artifacts, which, nevertheless, were taken, for example, in dating H. Breasted's collection (Egypt),
". . . our third object from Egypt turned out to be modern! It was one of the ... collections, supposed to be from the fifth dynasty (i.e., 2563-2423 B.C. according to [7}, about 4,000 years ago-A.F.). This was a dark day" ((70), p. 24).
To "save" traditional chronology, the object was declared a fake ([70], p. 24), since no one had doubted the traditional chronology of ancient Egypt.
"In support of the basic assumption, they (believers in the method-A.F.) list a series of indirect proofs, arguments, and computations whose accuracy is not high, treatment ambiguous, and the main proof given by test radiocarbon determination of samples with an a priori known age.... However, as soon as it comes to the discussion of the test results in dating the historical artifacts, everyone nods to the first experiments, a small (!-A.F.) series of samples ... " {[66), p. 104).
The absence (also recognized by Libby) of any representative test statistics for the objects whose reliable dating is known a priori and a divergence of many thousand years long make us question the appropriateness of applying the method to the time interval under consideration. It does not mean, however, that it cannot be applied for the purposes of geology, where errors of several thousand years do not matter. Libby writes:
"There has been no serious shortage of materials back to about 3,700 years with which we could check the accuracy and reliability of dating by carbon-14 ... I would say, from talking with historians, that they would stake their lives on 3,750 years, but with anything older than that, they begin to shake a little bit" ([70], p. 24).
In other words, as the inventor himself recognizes, the radiocarbon method was widely applied in particular where the obtained results were hard or impossible to check against other written evidence.
"Some archaeologists, while not doubting the scientific principles of carbon-14 dating, suggested that the method still involves a considerable margin of error due to factors which are not yet Wtderstood" ([70), p. 29).
Could it perhaps be that these errors still did not present obstacles to at least rough dating? As it turns out, the situation is more serious: The errors are too large and chaotic and attain a span of 1,000-2,000 years on dating objects that are 1-3-millennia old.



§10 Archaeological Dating Methods 135
The radiocarbon dates led to
"... confusion among the archaeologists. Some have accepted the physicists' indications . . . with characteristic admiration.. . . They hurried up to reconsider the chronological schemes (which, therefore, were not so finnly esta.blished?-A.F.) ... The first who declared himself openly against the radiocarbon method was Vladimir Milojcic ... not only storming at its practical applications, but also ... strongly criticizing the theoretical foundations. . . . Comparing individual measurements of modern samples with the average figure, he based his skepticism on a series of brilliant para.doxes. The shell of a living American mollusk with radioactivity level 13.8 turns out to be rather old, being about 1,200 years of age if we compare it with the average absolute norm, 15.3. Its radioactivity being 14.7, a blooming wild rose from North Africa will be 'dead' for as long as 360 years ... whereas an Australian eucalyptus of radioactivity 16.31 'does not exist' for the physicists at all, and will come into existence in 600 years. A Florida mollusk with 17.4 radioactivity units will be 'born' only in 1,080 years.... In the past, radioactivity level was no more uniform than today, and similar variations are also possible for ancient artifacts. Here are some examples: The radiocarbon dating of a sample from a medieval altar in Heidelberg . . . showed that a tree employed to repair it had not grown at all! . . . In a cave in Iran, the lower
levels were dated to 6054 ± 415 and 6595 ± 500 years B .C., while the upper to 8610
± 610 B .C. Thus ... they obviously were formed in reverse order, and the upper one turns out to be 2,556 years older than the lower. There are many similar examples to follows.... V. Milojcic calls on the physicists and their 'contractors', at least, to stop correcting 'critically' the radiocarbon dating results, and cancel the 'critical' censorship when the data are published. He asks the scientists not to reject the dates which seem improbable for some reason or other, and publish all the results without exception. He talks the archaeologists into ceasing the practice of acquainting the physicists with an approximate age of a find before its radioactive analysis, with holding the information until the figures are published! Otherwise, it will be impossible to establish how many radioactive dates coincide with the reliable historical ones, or determine how reliable the method is. Besides, on 'editing', the subjective attitude inftuences how the obtained chronological scheme looks. E.g., in Groningen, where the archaeologist Becker, a long-time supporter of the shorter chronology (of Europe-A.F.), is working, the radiocarbon results are also obtained to be low for 'some unknown reason', but Schleswig and Heidelberg, where Schwabdissen and others have long been inclined to the longer chronology, the radioactive dating of similar materials leads to much earlier dates" ((66], pp. 94-95).
In my opinion, any comment is superfluous. In summary, (1) Theoretical accuracy of carbon-14 dating, which can be achieved for comparatively "young" objects, equals about 1,000-1,500 years; hence, unfortunately, its application to dating antique artifacts seems to be doubtful. We should first investigate for as large a set of reliable data as possible the dependence of radiocarbon dates on the variation of carbon-14 content, intensity of cosmic radiation, distance to large water reservoirs and volcanoes, enormous quantities of various substances in the atmosphere, and so forth, with all this, in addition to other factors, essentially influencing the dating, as we have demonstrated above. (2) Other physical methods are sufficiently less accurate and have been carried out, basically, for the purp~es of geology; today, their application to dating antique artifacts is unreal.



136 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Lastly, great successes in working out the radiothermoluminescent method permitting us to date ceramic artifacts and burned clay have been made. However, here, too, numerous effects influence the dating of truly old artifacts, which are now barely taken into account. In particular,
"... one should know the quantity of radioactive elements not only in the substance of which an object is made, clay, but also in the environment surrounding it. Ha piece of ceramics had been buried for centuries, then the quantity of uranium, thorium and potassiwn in the soil or rock should be known" ([92], p. 113).
In 1972, the physicist S. Fleming made the method substantially more sophisticated in order to eliminate the dependence of the dating on radiation in the environment, which, certainly, almost always remains unknown and is not subject to estimation. Nevertheless,
". . . dating authentic terracotta of the Renaissance by the method of thermoluminescent analysis is related to certain difficulties" ([92), p. 138).
"Since the exhibits kept in variable environment were dealt with, the dose of external radiation was not simple to find" {[92), p. 139).
Still, the dating was carried out, but only because the researchers did possess authentic samples dated reliably as belonging to the Renaissance (from written sources). The samples dated questionably were compared just with these. It is obvious that the method cannot be appli~d to older, say, "antique" artifacts, without any independent and trust-worthy written information for dating them. Nor do we speak of a practically unrealizable opportunity to record the variable environment in which antique ceramics are kept in the museums (see above).
§11. Astronomical Dating. Ancient Eclipses and Horoscopes
At present, special tables, or astronomical canons, are available which list eclipse dates, umbra ranges, astronomical phases, and so forth, on the basis of the lunar theory. If an eclipse was given a sufficiently detailed description in antiquity, then the list of its observed (descriptive) characteristics can be compiled. Comparing them with the tables, we can attempt to find a suitable eclipse in the canon. We shall date the eclipse in question if we succeed. It may turn out that the textual description is satisfied not only by one, but already several eclipses from the astronomical canon, in which case the dating is not unique. While taking up certain problems of celestial mechanics, I noticed a possible relation of this familiar jump in D" to the results of Morozov, connected with the dating of ancient eclipse~. My investigation of this problem, and a new calculation of D", have shown unexpectedly that the new curve obtained for D" is of another qualitative character; in particular, the enigmatic jump vanishes completely, while D" oscillates about one and the same constant value coinciding with the modern one (see (3]). In short, this result is reduced to the following.



§11 Astronomical Dating. Ancient Eclipses and Horoscopes 137
The earlier computations of D" were based on the dates of ancient eclipses according to traditional chronology. All attempts to account for the strange jump in D" did not touch upon the problem whether or not the dates of eclipses regarded today as antique and early medieval were determined correctly. In other words, how well do the parameters of an eclipse described in a document, and the computed characteristics of that authentic eclipse allegedly described in the text to be dated, correspond to each other? A method of independent dating was suggested by Morozov in (1], namely, that all possible eclipse characteristics are extracted from a text under investigation, and then the dates of all the eclipses with these characteristics are mechanically extracted from the astronomical tables (canons). He discovered that, under the pressure of the established traditional chronology, the astronomers did not consider the whole spectrum of dates obtained: they took only those dates which fit in the time interval a priori dictated by historical tradition. It turned out that this practice often led the astronomers to the impossibility of discovering in the required century an eclipse precisely answering to the description in the document, while being forced, in most cases, and still not questioning the whole system of chronology, to resort to doubtful solutions, for example, to indicate an eclipse no more than partly satisfying the description. Revising the dating of supposedly ancient eclipses, Morozov discovered that the information about them could be separated into two categories: (1) Short and vague reports without particulars, with it often being unclear whether an eclipse at all is described; in this category, the astronomical dating is either senseless or results in so many possible solutions that they can fall into practically any historical epoch. . (2) Lengthy and detailed reports, with often unambiguous astronomical solutions that admit only two or three versions. All the eclipses in this category turn out to have received nontraditional dating, which did not assign them to the traditional interval from 1000 B.C. to A.O. 400, but considerably later (sometimes, many centuries), i.e., to A.O. 500-1600. Nevertheless, Morozov did not analyze the latter, assuming that traditional chronology from 300 to 1800 was basically "true", and that no contradiction would surface. Proceeding with the research initiated [1], I also subjected the eclipses from 400 to 1600 to an analysis. It turned out that the effect discovered in [1] for ancient eclipses could consequently be extended to those normally dated to A.O. 400-900, which means that two situations are realized: 1) there are many equivalent astronomical solutions (here astronomical dating is senseless); 2) there are only one or two solutions; in this case they fall into the years 9001700. It is only since about A.D. 900, and not 400 as supposed [1], that the consistency becomes satisfactory for the traditional eclipse dates given in the canon (73] with Morozov's results and is reliable only since A.O. 1300. Thus, we obtain the shift of the dates of many "ancient" eclipses in the medieval epoch from A.O. 900 to 1600. An analogous ''forward date shift" was also discovered by Morozov for the so-called horoscopes [l]. Five planets are seen with the naked eye; moving



138 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
along the ecliptic, they describe approximately the same circular path in the sky, called zodiac and divided into 12 sections. Astrology enjoyed enormous popularity in ancient times. A horoscope is the position of the planets with respect to the signs (constellations) of the zodiac. Fixing it, and knowing the sidereal periods at a particular point in time, we can calculate the planets' positions in the past or future by marking off their integral multiples backwards or forwards. However, the realization of this simple idea implies cumbersome calculations. Similar to the eclipse canons, there are special tables making dating of their ancient descriptions possible (we should not confuse them with those in the contemporary sense of the term). If the planets' position is given some textual description, then, as in the case of the eclipses, we can obtain the dates of all horoscopes with suitable characteristics from the tables. Again similarly to the eclipses, it turns out that under the pressure of the traditional chronology already established, and unable to find a suitable horoscope "in the required epoch", the astronomers forcibly resorted to doubtful conclusions and deviations from the text. Morozov analyzed the most famous ancient horoscopes in [1] and discovered that all those with detailed descriptions (or graphic representations) obtained medieval or even late medieval datings if we employed independent methods for them. We illustrate with some typical examples. Numerous attempts by P. Laplace, J. Fourier, A. Letronne, J. Biot, and K. Helm to find a suitable solution to a horoscope represented on the "round" and "long" zodiacs of the Dandarah temple in Egypt were not crowned with success ([1], Vol. 6, pp. 664-665, Figs. 672-673, Figs. 133, 135). The temple and its horoscopes are now dated to 30 B.C. and A.D. 14-37. Nevertheless, two exact astronomical solutions do exist. The first solution, A .D. 568 and 540, was discovered by Morozov [1]; the second solution, A.D. 1422 and 1394, was discovered recently by the Moscow physicists D.V. Denisenko and N.S. Kellin (for details, see Vol. 2 of the present book). In 1857, H. Brugsch discovered an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus whose inner cover represented the starry sky with a horoscope ([1], p. 696, Fig. 139). The whole burying ritual, ancient demotic writing, and so forth, dated the find to not earlier than the 1st century A.O. The attempts by the astronomers to date the horoscope as having originated at around the turn of the millennium failed. However, not only does the exact solution exist again, but it is unique in the whole interval of history: namely, A .D. 1682! In 1901, Flinders Petrie discovered a cave in Upper Egypt with an ancient Egyptian tomb and two horoscopes with the dates of the deaths of a man and his son buried there (I]. In the whole historic interval, there exists a unique solution ideally satisfying all the conditions of the problem, namely, A .D. 1049 (the father's horoscope) and 1065 (the son's horoscope). The son died 16 years after the father. The dating thus described also explains an exceptionally fine state of these ancient Egyptian pictures made in watercolour. The above-mentioned work also dates the horoscopes described, for example, in ancient biblical texts. We



§11 Astronomical Dating. Ancient Eclipses and Horoscopes 139
can compile a vocabulary of the terms and standard phrases frequently occurring in the preserved medieval astronomical literature and used to denote planets, constellations, and so on. Then, when encountering an ancient verbal description involving any of these terms, an attempt can be made to date it, and spell it out, as a horoscope by means of this vocabulary. Apparently, the first author who mentioned that the Revelation of John contained the verbal description of a horoscope was E. Renan [74]. He was not an astronomer, however, and did not date it, though the solution of the question is of considerable interest due to the existing problem of dating the Revelation of John. J. Sunderland declares that to take the end of the 1st century A .D. or even whatever other time as the date of the creation of the Revelation of John is to face great difficulties ((49], p. 135). However, it turns out that, though not unique, the exact solution does exist, too, namely, A.D. 395 and 1249 [l]. The date A.O. 395 differs from the traditional one for the Revelation of John by 300 years, whereas the second, A.O. 1249, differs already by 1,100-1,150 years. Accordingly, we stress that the bulk of Morozov's astronomical datings should be reconsidered. As a matter of fact, the assumption that traditional chronology since A .o. 300 is correct has often made him discontinue the computations and dwell, in most cases, on the first suitable solution discovered without turning to the late Middle Ages, which is vividly justified by the example of the Revelation of John. The second solution, A.D. 1249, was rejected by Morozov as "too late". He wrote: "Hardly anyone will say that the Revelation of John was written on September 14, 1249 ... " ([l], Vol. 1, p. 53). Our point of view is that we should investigate the whole spectrum of possible solutions, the more so because there are sound reasons to believe (see below) that traditional chronology until the end of the 13th century should be completely revised. Another example is given by the dating of the famous eclipse accompanying the crucifixion according to the early Christian authors such as Synkellos, Phlegon, Aphricanus, Eusebius, and others. The traditional date of April 3, A.D. 33, cannot withstand even minimal criticism [1]. In spite of considerable controversy surrounding the characteristics of this eclipse, which is repeatedly discussed in the literature (e.g., [73]), we can try to date it. The first exact solutions (found by Morozov in [l]) turn out to fall between 200 B.C. and A.O. 800, namely, A.D. 368. The calculations in [1] were not extended to the later centuries for the above reasons. I did extend the computations to the whole interval of history up to A .D. 1600 and unexpectedly discovered another precise solution, i.e., April 3, A .o. 1075, which differs from the traditional one by one millennium, and by 700 years from that found in [1). From the formal standpoint, the two solutions are equivalent, and we have to base ourselves on another argument in order to make a final choice. We recall once again that the agreement of the traditional astronomical dates with the calculated ones becomes satisfactory only beginning with the 10th century, and reliable only since the 13th century.

§12. New Experimental and Statistical Methods of Dating Ancient Events
12.1. Introduction
In my opinion, the main goal is the creation of novel and statistically independent methods of dating ancient events. It is only subsequently that we can turn to the analysis of the whole of chronology on the basis of the obtained results. One method, even as effective as the astronomical one mentioned above, is absolutely insufficient for a profound analysis of the dating problem due to its exceptional difficulty and requires a cross verification of the dates by different techniques. I attained this goal as follows. (1) New experimental and statistical procedures for dating ancient events were worked out (2], [3], [4], and (5]. (2) Their efficiency was checked experimentally against a sufficiently large amount of information regarding medieval history, confirming the correctness of the obtained results. (3) The methods were then applied to the ancient historical chronological data, which resulted in important laws in ancient and medieval chronology and history [2]-[5]. (4) The laws were collected and systematized as the global chronological diagram (GCD), which I briefly described in [2]-(5]. (5) The hypothetical mechanism of the origin of versions of the traditional chronological ancient and medieval history could be constructed from the GCD. We shall now give a brief account of some of these methods.
12.2. Volume graphs for historical chronicles. The maximum correlation principle. Computational experiments and typical examples
Suppose that a certain period between the two years A and B of the history of a state is described annually in some sufficiently long text X by means of chronicles, annals, and so forth, which is broken, or could be broken, into
pieces, "chapters" X(t), each of which describes one year t. We can count their volume, for example, the number of words, signs or pages, and represent the obtained values graphically by marking the years t off on the horizontal, and the chapter volumes on the vertical scale (see Fig. 22).
In general, the corresponding graph will have a different form for another text Y, since the authors' propensities influence the volume distribution. For example, an art history and a military chronicle will place accents differently;

the amount of information with respect to different years will be distributed differently, too. How essential are these differences, i.e., do there exist characteristics of the volume graphs which are only determined by the time interval
(A, B) and the country r, and which uniquely characterize all (or almost all) texts describing them? The important characteristic of the volume graph turns out to be given by the years in which the graph shows peaks, i.e., attains local maxima. They indicate the years described in more detail. In general, different years will receive detailed descriptions in different, independent chronicles. Let C(t) be the volume of all texts describing the events of a particular year t and having been written by contemporaries. According to our information-loss model, there will be more information left from those years in which especially many texts were created. It is difficult to verify the hypothesis in its present form, because the graph of C(t) is unknown to us, and the texts and their information are gradually lost. However, we can check one of the corollaries, namely, later authors X and Y who were not contemporaries to those ancient events and who described the same period, had to make use of approximately the same collection of the preserved texts; therefore, they would "on the average" speak more of those years from which more texts survived, and less of those from which less was known. In other words, the authors "on the average" must have increased the number of particulars in writing about the time from which more texts were available. The maximum correlation principle can eventually be formulated as follows:
The volume graphs for the chapters of two dependent texts X and Y which
describe the same period (A, B) and the state r must attain local maxima, or form peaks, simultaneously, i.e., years described in X and Y in detail should be close or coincide. Conversely, if two texts X and Y are known as undoubtedly independent and describe either different periods ( A, B) and (C, D) of the same length or different states, then their volume graphs reach local maxima at different points if we let (A, B) and (C, D) coincide.



142 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
The principle will be justified if for most pairs of authentic and sufficiently large dependent texts depicting the same events, their volume graphs form peaks at about the same time. Meanwhile, the peaks themselves may be much different, and there must be no correlation between the peaks of the graphs for authentic independent texts. The simultaneity of the peaks of the volume graph should certainly be only approximate for concrete dependent texts. To estimate their nearness quantitatively, we shall calculate the square sum <p( X, Y) of the distances <pi: in years from the point of a peak indexed by k of the volume graph for X to the kth peak of the volume graph for Y. If both graphs have peaks simultaneously, i.e., if the moments of the peaks with the same indices coincide, then all <p1: are equal to zero. Considering a sufficiently large fixed stock of different authentic texts H, and calculating <p(X, H) for each of them, we then only select H with ip(X, H) less than or equal to ip(X, Y). Finding their part in the entire stock of H, we shall obtain a coefficient which (under the hypothesis regarding the distribution of the random vector H) can be interpreted as the probability d(X, Y). If the coefficient is "small", the texts X and Y are dependent; if it is large, they are independent, i.e., they describe different events. In 1978-1980, I performed a vast computational experiment in order to
evaluate d(X, Y) for several hundred pairs of concrete historical texts, including chronicles, annals, and so forth (see the details in [2]). It turned out that d(X, Y) very clearly distinguished between dependent and independent textual pairs. I discovered that for all authentic texts (X, Y) under investigation and describing different events known a priori as such (or different historical epochs or states), i.e., for independent texts, d(X, Y) varied from 1 to 1/100 (for ten to fifteen local maxima); conversely, if two texts X and Y were known a priori as dependent and described the same events, then d(X, Y) did not exceed 10-s (for the same number of maxima). A typical example is shown in Fig. 22. Namely, let X be Sergeyev's monograph Essays on the History of Ancient Rome, and Y be Livy's History of Rome. Then d(X, Y) is 2-10- 12 , which implies the interdependence of the texts which are both describing the same period in Roman history. If, however, we take the first part of X as X', and
the second half as Y', i.e., certainly independent texts, then p(X', Y') = 1/3. We now give another example of undoubtedly dependent texts, namely, X is the Nikiforovskaya chronicle and Y is the Suprasl'skaya chronicle (19]. Both volume graphs for the time period from 850 to 1255 exhibit peaks practically
simultaneously (Fig. 23) in the same years, and d(X, Y) = 10-24 • The experiment compared ancient texts with ancient ones, ancient with modern ones, and modern with modern ones. Along with the chapter volume graphs, other quantitative textual characteristics were investigated, namely, the quantity graphs of the mentioned names, given the numbel' of textual mentions of individual years, other fixed text reference frequency graphs, and so forth [2]. The same maximum correlation principle turns out to be valid for all these characteristics: The graphs of undoubtedly dependent texts form peaks almost simultaneously, and the peaks are

not correlated on the graphs of undoubtedly independent texts, which permits us to suggest a new dating method for ancient events.
Let Y be a historical text describing unknown events whose absolute dating has been lost. Let the years t be counted since an undated event of local importance, for example, the foundation of some city or the crowning of a king. We construct the volume graph for the chapters of Y and compare it with those of other dated texts. If among these texts, a text X with small
d(X, Y) is discovered which is of the same order as for pairs of dependent texts, i.e., if it does not exceed 10-8 , then we can conclude with sufficiently large probability, becoming greater as d(X, Y) decreases, that the events described coincide. The method has been verified experimentally for a priori dated medieval texts. The obtained dates coincided. We illustrate this with the example where Y is the Dvinsky chronicle (the shorter version) describing the events in a 327-year-long interval [19]. Going through the list of chronicles in the Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles, we discover a text X whose volume graph forms peaks almost in the same years as that for Y (after the time intervals (A, B) and (C, D) have been
made to coincide), where d(X, Y) = 2 • 10-25 • It turns out that the text X
is the complete version of the same Dvinskaya chronicle [19], with (A, B) =
1390-1717. The obtained dating of the text Y coincided with its standard dating.
12.3. Method of recognition and dating the dynasties of ancient rulers. The small-distortion principle
Suppose a historical text has been found, describing an unknown dynasty of rulers with known rule durations. The question arises whether this dynasty is, in fact, new and unknown (hence, requiring a dating}, or whether it is one



144 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
of the known dynasties described in unusual terms, with the names of rulers altered, and so forth. The answer is given by the method described below (see its short description in [4) and [5]). Consider a sequence of authentic rulers in a state. We call this sequence an authentic dynasty. Its members must not necessarily be relatives. The same authentic dynasty can often be described in different documents (by different chroniclers) and from different standpoints estimating the rule lengths differently, and so on. But there do exist "invariant" facts whose descriptions depend less on the propensities of the chroniclers, for example, rule durations. Normally, there are no special reasons for which a chronicler would considerably or intentionally distort this number. Nevertheless, chroniclers often face difficulties in calculating the duration of a king's rule. Naturally, for example, due to the incompleteness of information, distortions in the documents, and so on, they have sometimes caused different chroniclers to supply different figures which were, in their opinion, the rule of the same king. Such discrepancy can be characteristic, e.g., of the pharaohs in Brugsch's tables and [6). Thus, describing an authentic dynasty, each chronicler calculates the durations of the kings' rules in his own way and obtains a sequence of numbers (A1 , A2 , ... , Ak), with Ap representing (possibly, with an error) the authentic rule of a king indexed by p, and with k being the total number of kings in the dynasty. This sequence (extracted from the chronicle) will be called a numerical dynasty. While describing the same authentic dynasty, another chronicler will possibly ascribe other rule durations to the same kings and obtain another numerical dynasty (B1, B2 , ..• , Bk)- Thus, the same authentic dynasty described in different chronicles can be represented as different numerical dynasties. We now formulate the "small-distortion principle": If two numerical dynasties are "little" different from one another, then they represent the same authentic dynasty and are two variants of its description (in which case the numerical dynasties will be said to be dependent); if, however, two numerical dynasties represent two different authentic dynasties, then they are "considerably" different from each other (in which case we call them independent).
In other words, chroniclers "little" distort authentic dynasties in writing a chronicle; at any rate, the discrepancy which can arise is less than that between different authentic dynasties. The above assertion should be verified. In case it is valid, we discover an important, and not at all obvious, property characterizing practically all chroniclers of antiquity, namely, numerical dynasties that arise from describing one authentic dynasty are different from each other-and also from the prototype-by less than two different authentic dynasties. It turns out that to estimate the "nearness" of two dynasties, we can introduce a numerical coefficient ">.,(M, H) similar to d(X, Y), which still has the same meaning as probability. We describe it without going into details. It is convenient to represent a numerical dynasty as a graph by indicating the numbers of kings on the horizontal, and their rule duration on the vertical



§12 New Experimental and Statistical Methods of Dating Ancient Events 145
scale. We will say that a dynasty Il is "similar" to the dynasties M and H if its graph differs from that of M by not less than the graph of H differs from that of M (see the details in [2], [4], [5]). We take as .\(M, H) the part made up by the dynasties that are "similar" to M and H in the set of all dynasties, i.e., the ratio of the number of all dynasties "similar" to M and H to the total number of dynasties fixed in the chronicles. Rule durations may be determined wrongly by the chroniclers, and we actually extract only approximate values. The probability mechanisms leading to the errors can be described mathematically. Besides, we have then taken into account another two of the chroniclers' possible error, namely, mixing up neighbouring kings and their replacement by one whose rule duration equals the sum of theirs. The small-distortion principle should be verified. In 1977-1979, I investigated J. Blair's tables [6] containing all the basic chronological data pertaining to the history of Europe, the Mediterranean, the Near East, and Egypt from 4000 B.C. to A.O. 1800. The data were checked and supplemented with the information from 14 more modern tables. For all the epochs in the history of the regions, a complete list of all 15-term dynasties was made, namely, of all groups consisting of 15 consecutive kings. Each could fall in several different 15-term dynasties, i.e., dynasties could "overlap". We can compute .\(M, H) or any two 15-term dynasties Mand H. My computational experiment then showed that the small-distortion principle could be regarded as fully reliable, namely, for two a priori dependent dynasties,
>..(M, H) is always of the order of 10- 12 to 10-8 , whereas, for a priori independent dynasties, the typical value of .\(M, H) oscillates from 1/10 to 1/100 (and in some rare cases, amounts to 1/1000). The sharp difference (to the extent of several orders) between dependent and independent dynasties is obvious. Thus, by means of .\(M, H), we can reliably distinguish between dependent and independent pairs of dynasties. The important experimental fact is that the chroniclers have not made very "serious" mistakes; anyway, the errors are essentially less than the value for distinguishing independent dynasties, which permits us (within the framework of the experiment performed) to suggest a new method for recognizing dependent dynasties and dating independent ones. Proceeding from the analogy of the previous item; we calculate the coefficient >.(M, D) for an unknown dynasty D, where M are known dynasties. If we find a dynasty M for which this coefficient is small, then we can assert that the dynasties M and D are dependent (with probability >..(M, D)), i.e., M and D are associated with a real one whose dating is already available (for M is dated). This method has been verified against medieval dynasties with a priori known dating. The efficiency of the method was fully confirmed.
12.4. The frequency-damping principle. A method of ordering texts in time
The present method permits us, for example, to discover a chronologically correct order for individual textual chapters and duplicates on the basis of the collection of proper names mentioned. As in the earlier methods, we strive for



146 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
creating a dating technique based on the quantitative characteristics of the texts that are not requiring an analysis of the contents, which could be rather ambiguous and vague. If a document mentions any "famous" historical figures known earlier from other, already dated chronicles, this permits us to date the described events. However, if such an identification is not immediately successful, and if, moreover, the events of several generations with a large quantity of historical figures previously unknown are described, then the problem of establishing the identity of personages with those known is made more complicated. In short, we call a fragment of a text describing the events of one generation "a generationchapter". We shall assume that the mean duration of one "generation" is the average duration of the rule of authentic kings fixed in the available chronicles. This mean duration of a rule was computed by the author on the basis of the results obtained in processing the information contained in Blair's Tables [6] and the GCD (see above). It equals 17.1 years. In working with authentic texts, we face certain difficulties if we want to distinguish chapter generations from them; therefore, we have restricted ourselves only to an approximate partition of the text. Let a text X describe the events in a sufficiently large time interval (A, B) when several generations of historical figures have replaced each other. Suppose that X is broken into the chapter generations X(T), where T is the ordinal number of the generation described in X (T) relative to the numbering fixed in the text. The question arises: Have these chapter generations been enumerated (or ordered) in the text? Or, if this enumeration has been lost (or is doubtful), then how can it be restored? In other words, how can the chapters be placed in time with respect to each other? As it turns out for authentic historical texts, the following formula is valid, namely,
full name = historical figure, which means that if a time interval described is sufficiently large (tens or hundreds of years long), then, as I verified when analyzing a large set of historical documents, in the overwhelming majority of cases, different personages have different full names in the same texts. A full name can consist of several words, e.g., Charles the Bald. In other words, the number of different persons with the same full names is negligibly small, compared with that of all personages, which is valid for all the several hundred texts I investigated and which describe Greece, Germany, Italy, Russia, and others. In fact, the writer of a historical text is interested in distinguishing between different historical figures in order to avoid ambiguity. The simplest method to attain this is to give different full names to different people, which is justified by calculation. We now formulate the frequency-damping pnnciple describing the chronologically correct order of chapter generations: In the correct enumeration of chapter generations, the author of the text, while proceeding from the description of one generation to another, also describes other histoncal figures, namely, he does not speak at all of the personages of the generations (since they have not yet been born) belonging to those pnor to a generation numbered T0 ; then, in describing T0 , the author speaks of the histoncal figures of this



§12 New Experimental and Statistical Methods of Dating Ancient Events 141
generation more, since the described events are related to them most; and, finally, proceeding with the description of subsequent generations, the author mentions the prior historical figures still less and less, since new events with new historical figures drive out the dead.
Thus, each generation gives birth to new historical figures, who are replaced when generations are replaced. In spite of the apparent simplicity, this principle may be useful in creating a dating method. The frequency-damping principle can be reformulated equivalently. Since the personages are practically
uniquely determined by their full names (name = personage), we will study the complete set of all the full names contained in a text. The term "complete" will be omitted. Consider a group of names first appearing in a text and a chapter generation T0 • We will call them T0 -names, and the corresponding personages T0 -personages. The quantity of all mentions (taken with their multiplicities) of all the names in this chapter will be denoted by K(T0 , T0 ). We then count how many times the same names have been mentioned in a
chapter T. The obtained number will be denoted by K(T0 , T). Meanwhile, if
the same name is repeated several times, then all these mentions are counted. Construct the graph by marking the numbers of chapters on the horizontal
scale, and K(T0 , T), where T0 is fixed, on the vertical scale. For each T0 , we obtain its own graph. The frequency-damping principle is then formulated as follows:
In the chronologically correct enumeration of chapter generations, each graph of K(To, T) should vanish to the left of T0 , attain an absolute maximum at T0 , and then gradually dampen (see Fig. B,l).

We call this graph ideal. The formulated principle must be checked experimentally. If it is true, and the chapters are ordered chronologically correctly, then all experimental graphs should be close to the ideal. The experimental verification I performed has fully fustified the frequency-damping principle. We illustrate this with several typical examples.



148 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
12.5. Applications to Roman and Greek history
Example 1. Livy's History of Rome. All the graphs of K(T0 , T) for the part describing the years 750-293 B.C. and 510-293 B.C. turned out to be almost identical with the ideal, i.e., most of the names first appearing in one generation most often appear in the description of just this generation, and then gradually vanish. Therefore, the principle is confirmed, and the order of chapter generations is chronologically correct in these parts of the History of Rome.
Example 2. Liber Pontificalis by Mommsen and Gestorum Pontificum Romanorum (95]-[96]. We single out portions describing A .D. 300-560, 560-900, 900-1250, and 1250-1500. It turns out that all the graphs of K(T0 , T) practically coincide with the ideal here, too, which also confirms the principle. We should draw our attention to one of the corollaries to the performed experiment, namely, no fashion for names was traced in considerable time intervals (which is not at all obvious). Certainly, some names used in antiquity are also in use today (Peter, Mary, and so forth); however, as was made clear, these names are either incomplete or their percentage is small in comparison with the whole mass of dying names. The availability of the surviving names signifies that the experimental graphs of I<(T0 , T) occur in moving from left to right, not up to zero, but up to a certain nonzero constant.
Example 3. The following set of primary sources has been taken as a text X describing A .D. 976-1341 in Byzantine history: (1) Psellus, M., The Chronographia of Michael Psellus; (2) Anna Comnena, The Alexiad of Anna Comnena; (3) Cinnamus, Joannes, Epitome rerum ab Joanne et Alexis; (4) Aconiates, Nicetas, Historia; (5) Acropolita, Georgius, Chronicon Constantinopolitanum; (6) Pachymeres, Georgius, De Michaele et Andronico Palaelogo, lib. 1-8; (7) Gregoras, Nichephorus, Byzantinae Historiae. The above set contains tens of thousands of full names (taking their multiplicities into account). All the graphs I<(T0 , T) turned out to be practically identical with the ideal.
Example 4. Gregorovius' History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages. The fragments describing A.D. 300-560, 560-900, and 1250-1500 were extracted from this text, each of which was divided into chapter generations, and the total collection of the names counted several tens of thousands of mentions. It turned out that the frequency-damping principle was also valid and the ordering of chapters in each of these fragments chronologically correct. A similar result was also obtained for the monograph of Kolrausch History of Germany, in which three pieces describing A.D. 600-1000, 1000-1273, and 1273-1700 were distinguished. Several dozen historical texts were investigated; in all the cases, the frequency-damping principle was confirmed. Hence, we have a method of ordering textual chapter generations chronologically correctly if this order was disturbed or unknown. Consider the totality of chapter generations in a text



§12 New Experimental and Statistical Methods of Dating Ancient Events 149
X and enumerate them somehow. For each chapter X(T0 ), we than plot the
graph of K(T0 , T). All the values K(T0 , T) with variable T0 and T can be naturally organized into a square matrix K {T} of order n x n, where n is the number of chapters. In the ideal theoretical case, the matrix K {T} has the form shown in Fig. 25 and possesses zeroes below the principal diagonal and the absolute maximum in each of its rows.

Figure 26. Experimental graphs may not coincide with the theoretical one.
Each graph decreases monotonically and vanishes in every row. It goes without saying that experimental graphs may not coincide with the theoretical one
(see Fig. 26). Now, if we alter the chapter enumeration, then K(T0 , T) will be altered, too, because of a rather complicated redistribution of the "names appearing for the first time". Hence, the matrix K {T} and its elements do vary. Changing the order of the chapters by means of various permutations and calculating the new matrix K {uT}, where uT is the new enumeration



150 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
corresponding to a permutation u, we will seek their order such that all or almost all graphs will be of the form shown in Fig. 24, and the experimental matrix K {uT} will be closest to the theoretical in Fig. 25. That order of chapters for which the deviation of the experimental matrix from the theoretical is the least should be taken as chronologically correct and required. The description of the "proximity criterion" is omitted. The method also permits us to date events. Suppose it is only known about a given text Y that it depicts some events of an epoch (A, B) already described in the chapter generations of a text X, their order being chronologically correct. How can we learn what generation precisely is described in Y if we only make use of quantitative textual characteristics and do not consider the possibly ambiguous contents admitting different interpretation. The answer may be given by adjoining the text Y to the chapters of X, treating Y as a new chapter, and ascribing a certain number T0 to it; we then find an optimal order of the chapters, which must be chronologically correct. Meanwhile, we also determine a correct place for the new chapter Y. In the simplest case, having constructed the graph of K(T0 , T), we can make it as close to the ideal as we please by placing Y appropriately. The position which Y occupies relative to the other chapters should be taken as the required. We thereby date the events described in Y. This technique may be also applicable when we consider only a few names, e.g., certain ''famous" ones. Let us verify our method against texts with a priori known dating.
Example 1. Consider the period from 500 to 20 B.C. in Greek history. We take Plutarch's Parallel Lives as a text X. Making use of the above method, we see that all chapter generations are placed correctly in it. As Y, we select the Pyrrhus, describing the events usually dated to have occurred from 319 to 272 B.C. Looking for its correct position among the other chapters, we find that it should be placed at the end of the 4th or at the beginning of the 3rd century B .c., which is quite consistent with the earlier dating. We obtain a rougher result, since we deal with chapters describing whole generations, and not separate years, but then we have dated the Pyrrhus without turning to its contents.
Example 2. We have considered and dated (by our method based on the above-mentioned medieval Byzantine chronicles) the following Byzantine texts describing the Crusades: X is the Histoire anonime de la premiere croisade (Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolimitanorum) whose traditional dating to A.D. 1099 coincided with the one we obtained, namely, the end of the 11th century; and Y is Robert de Clari's La Conquete de Constantinople, traditionally dated to A .D. 1204, was also related by us to the beginning of the 13th century. Thus, the efficiency of the method was confirmed in employing medieval texts with a priori known dating.

12.6. The frequency-duplication principle. The duplicate-discovery method
The present method is, in a certain sense, a special case of the previous one; however, because of its importance, we have distinguished the duplicatediscovery method separately. Let an interval (A, B) be described in a text X which is divided into the chapter generations X(T). Suppose they were in general enumerated chronologically correctly, with two duplicates among them, i.e., two chapters speaking of the same generation, and repeating each other. Consider the simplest situation where the same chapter is repeated in the text X twice, namely, numbered T0 and C0 • Our method makes it possible to discover and identify these duplicates. It is clear that the graphs of K(T0 , T) and /((C0 , T) have the form shown in Fig. 27. The first graph explicitly does not satisfy the frequency-damping principle; hence, we have to permute the chapters in X in order to achieve a better agreement with the theoretical graph. All values K( C0 , T) vanish, since there are no "new names" in the chapter X(C0 ); they all have already appeared in X(T0 ). It is obvious that the best coincidence with the graph in Fig. 24 will be attained if we juxtapose these two duplicates or simply identify them. Thus, if among the chapters generally enumerated correctly, we have discovered two whose graphs have approximately the form of those in Fig. 27, then these chapters, most probably, are duplicates (i.e., tell of the same events) and should be identified. All the aforesaid can be transferred to the case where there are several duplicates (three or more).

supplied with detailed commentary. It is evident that the commentary can be regarded as a series of chapters duplicating the text of Machiavelli himself. It was divided into chapter generations, which permitted us to construct a square matrix K{T} also taking into account the commentary. The matrix has the form shown in Fig. 28, where the blocks filled with maxima are shown in thick lines, which means that our method does discover duplicates which are, in our case, made up of the commentary to the text of the History of Florence.

12.7. Statistical analysis of the complete list of all the names mentioned in the Bible
The following example is very important for the analysis of global chronology. The Bible contains tens of thousands of names. It is generally known that there are two series of biblical duplicates, namely, each generation described in the First and Second Book of Samuel, the First and Second Book of Kings, and then again in the First and Second Book of the Chronicles. I have divided the Old and New Testament into chapter generations as shown below. For reference, the canonical division into standard chapters and verses was retained, which certainly does not coincide with the division into chapter generations. Each of the chapter generations listed here (of course, approximately) describes only one generation of personages, due to which the following division of the Bible was obtained. We indicate the biblical fragments which compose individual chapter generations. The division of Genesis into chapter generations is given first, namely,
(1) 1-3 (Adam, Eve);

Thus, the Old Testament has been broken into 191 chapter generations. The New Testament consists of Chapters 192-218. We shall now consider only Chapters 1-170. Meanwhile, Genesis 4: 18 was divided into three generation chapters. The other subsequent chapters (including the New Testament) will not be required for the present and are therefore omitted. In 1974-1979, V.P. Fomenko and T.G. Fomenko carried out the enormous job of compiling the complete list of all the names mentioned in the Bible, taken with their multiplicities, and exactly distributing the names in generation chapters. It turned out that altogether about 2,000 names are mentioned, whereas, the number of references with their multiplicities amounts to tens of



§12 New Experimental and Statistical Methods of Dating Ancient Events 155
thousands. Accordingly, all the graphs of K(T0 , T) were constructed, where the number T ranges over all the chapters listed. The graphs constructed for the chapters from the First and Second Book of Samuel and the First and Second Book of Kings turned out to have the form of the graph in Fig. 27, i.e., names first appearing in these chapters are then given "birth" again in the corresponding chapters from the First and Second Book of the Chronicles. The corresponding part of the matrix K {T} is shown in Fig. 29. Two parallel diagonals filled with the absolute maxima of the rows are marked with two thick lines. Thus, our method has successfully discovered and identified those duplicates in the Bible which were also known earlier as such.

12.8. Statistical analysis of the complete list of all parallel passages in the Bible
The application of these methods is sometimes made easier by the fact that, for many a historical text, the commentators have revealed the repeating fragments. By a "repetition", we mean not only a repetition of a name, but also a repeated description of a particular event, and so forth. For example, the same descriptions, lists of names, religious formulas, and so on, are encountered in the Bible many times. All of them have been discovered in the Bible long ago and were systematized and mentioned in the list of parallel passages; namely, close to certain verses, it is indicated which verses of this or other books of the Bible are regarded as "repetitions" (which are "parallel"). If a text X under investigation has been supplied with this, or a similar, list of parallel passages, then we can apply the duplicate-discovery method, regarding the repeated fragments as "repeated names" .



156 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
We illustrate this with an example. Consider the books of the Bible from Genesis to the Book of Nehemiah. The partition of the Bible into chapter generations has been given above. We now enumerate them in the order in which they replace each other in the canonical ordering. The list of "parallels" contains approximately 20,000 repeated verses. We count in each X (T) the number of verses which have not yet appeared in the preceding chapters X (T)
(i.e., first appearing in X(T0 )). We denote their number by Il(T0 , T0 ). We then count how many times these verses repeat in the subsequent X(T). We
denote the obtained quantities by Il(T0 , T). All graphs of Il(T0 , T) have been constructed (altogether 169 graphs). They differ from those of K(T0 , T) only in dealing with verses instead of names, and names instead of verses. The verses which are not repetitions of each other or some other verse are regarded as "different names,,.4 Hence, in the correct chronological order of chapter generations, with duplicates being absent, the verse repetition graphs Il(T0 , T) should have the form of that shown in Fig. 24. Similarly to the case of employing names, the author of a text (for the correct order of the described events) says nothing of the events of the generation T0 in the preceding chapters (these events have not yet occurred), says a lot while describing the events of the generation T0 , and recalls them still less and less in the subsequent chapters, i.e., the graph possesses an absolute maximum at the point T0 , vanishes to the left of T0 , and decreases monotonically to the right of T0 • An experimental check which I performed has justified the frequency-damping principle for all the fragments of the Bible, listed below, namely, (1) Genesis 1-5; (2) Genesis 610; (3) Genesis 11; (4) Genesis 12-38; (5) Genesis 39-50; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Deuteronomy; The Book of Joshua; The Book of Judges 1-18; (6) The Book of Judges 19-21; Ruth; The First and Second Book of Samuel; The First and Second Book of Kings 1-23; (7) The First and Second Book of the Chronicles; The Book of Ezra and Nehemiah. It turns out that all the graphs
of Il(T0 , T) are of the form of the theoretical graph in Fig. 24 for each of these texts, which means that the frequency-damping principle is valid in this case; besides, the order of the chapters is chronologically correct, while duplicates are absent. If all the chapters of a text are enumerated correctly as a whole, then the duplicates can be discovered by plotting the "verse repetition graphs" of
Il(T0 , T). If two chapters X(T0 ) and X(C0 ) are duplicates, then the graphs of Il(T0 , T) and Il(C0 , T) are of the form demonstrated in Fig. 27. This method has also been experimentally checked for the above example, namely, [the
First Book of Samuel + the Second Book of Samuel + the First Book of
Kings + the Second Book of Kings) duplicate [the First and Second Book
of the Chronicles]. The construction of the graphs of Il(T0 , T) revealed that the duplicates were just those chapters from [the First and Second Book of
4 This entire enormous job was carried out by V.P. Fomenko and T.G. Fomenko.



§12 New Experimental and Statistical Methods of Dating Ancient Events 157
Samuel + the First and Second Book of Kings] and [the First and Second Book of the Chronicles], which were duplicates from the standpoint of the
graphs of K(T0 , T), thus indicating the complete consistency of the results of the application of both methods. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the list of parallelisms is not identical with that of repeated names, since, for example, many fragments (verses of the Bible) not containing names at all are regarded to be "parallel".
12.9. Duplicates in the Bible
We now continue with a short description of the results of applying our methods to the antique and medieval chronological data. In doing so, duplicates traditionally regarded as different, and dated today to substantially different years, have been discovered unexpectedly. We have applied the duplicate-recognition method (on the basis of the
graphs of K(T0 , T) and Il(T0 , T)) to the Bible, namely the Old Testament
from Genesis to Esther. The obtained results will be represented as a line (=
chronicle) B in which duplicates (i.e., fragments of the Bible speaking of the same events, as follows from the verification described above of the frequencyduplication principle) have been denoted by identical symbols (letters). Thus, the line
B=TKTHTKTKTHTTPT~,
n
p
which means that the entire "historical part" of the Old Testament consists of several fragments, namely, T, K, H, Il, P, Ca, with some of them repeating several times, and placed differently in the Canon, thus yielding the above line B. In other words, many of the fragments (indicated in B) of the Old Testament actually describe the same events, thus contradicting the traditional ideas according to which the different books of the Bible (except the
First and Second Book of Samuel + the First and Second Book of Kings and the First and Second Book of the Chronicles) describe different events. Let us decode the symbols of the chronicle B. Indicating a symbol, we list the corresponding fragments of the Bible in brackets. Thus, B equals T (Genesis 1-3) K (Genesis 4-5) T (Genesis 6-8) H (Genesis 9-10) T (Genesis 11:1-9) K (Genesis 11:10-32) T (Genesis 12) K (Genesis 13-38) T (Genesis 39-50, Exodus) H /TI/P (Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, The Book of Joshua and the Book of Judges 1-18) T (The Book of Judges 19-21) T (Ruth, the First and Second Books of Samuel, the First Book of Kings 1-11) P (the First Book of Kings 12-22, the Second Book of Kings 1-23) T (the Second Book of Kings 24) Ca (the Second Book of Kings 25, the Book of Ezra, the Book of Nehemiah, Esther).

of the biblical Chapters 1-170 as follows. Two earlier-known duplicate series, (namely, Chapters 98-137 and their duplicates, Chapters 138-167) imply that, along with the maxima filling the principal diagonal, there is another diagonal also composed of maxima and parallel to the principal in rows 98-137 (see Figs. 30(a), 30(b)). These diagonals are represented as black oblique segments. Rows 138-167 practically consist solely of zeroes. The other duplicates could be discovered by approximately identical local peaks placed in the intersections of the corresponding rows and columns. The duplicates of the series T, as encountered in the Old Testament most frequently, are represented in Fig. 30a, b (see the particulars below).
12.10. The enquete-code or formalized "biography" method
Ancient literature used to resort to cliches and borrowings, for example, in the description of some particular rulers. Sometimes, the chroniclers ascribed the character and deeds of ancient kings to other rulers. To detect and study these cliches and duplicates, I have introduced the concept of enquete-code, or formalized "biography". An authentic ruler described in the chronicles will thereby acquire a "historical literary biography", which might have nothing to do with the authentic one and can be legendary. On the basis of the investigation of a large number of historical biographies, a table called an enquete-code was worked out, hierarchically ordering the facts of the biography with the decrease of their invariance relative to the personal attitudes of the authors.



160 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
An enquete-code consists of 34 items, each of which contains several subitems, see Chapter 4. How can we know, without resorting to the analysis of the contents of the chronicles, whether or not these chronicles describe the same authentic dynasty? If the rule durations are indicated in the chronicles, then we can apply the numerical dynasty recognition method (see Section 12.3 above). However, if such numerical data are not available, then the problem gets more complicated. Thus, how can the same authentic dynasty be distinguished from the set of all enquete-codes? To solve the problem, a method based on the small-distortion principle (see above) has been worked out. In this case, it is formulated thus:
If the enquite-codes of two dynasties differ "little" from each other, then
they represent the same authentic dynasty; however, if two enquete-codes represent different dynasties, then they are "far" from one another.
Here, we omit the description of the numerical coefficient similar to J\(M, H) and permitting us to separate reliably the "dependent enquete-codes" from the "independent" ones (see the particulars in [2]). The experimental check has confirmed the validity of the small-distortion principle in this case, too: It turned out that the enquete-codes representing the same dynasty were much less different from each other than those of different authentic dynasties. It is obvious that this circumstance permits us to date the enquete-codes of dynasties in accordance with the above procedure.
12.11. A method for the chronological ordering of ancient maps
I also developed a method for the chronological order of ancient maps. Any geographical map reflects the state of geoscience of the period when the map was made. With the development of scientific ideas, maps improve more and more, i.e., the amount of incorrect information decreases, and that of reliable data increases. An optimal map-code permitting us to represent any map (given graphically or described verbally) as a table similar to an EC was worked out and based on the analysis of concrete ancient maps. The list of items of this table will be omitted here. An experimental check performed in 19791980 permitted us to formulate and justify the following "chart-improvement principle" .
If a chronologically correctly ordered sequence of maps is given, then, in the transfer from old charts to new ones, two processes occur, namely, incorrect features which do not correspond to real geography vanish and no longer appear on the maps, i.e., "errors are not repeated", and the correct ones which have been introduced, e.g., availability of a channel or river, profile of the bank, are fixed and retained in all subsequent charts.
Due to the role which maps always played in sea-faring, and so forth, this chart-improvement principle has been introduced because of the urgent requirements arising from practice. The principle has been verified according to the procedure used in the previous items. We establish a certain order of the



§12 New Experimental and Statistical Methods of Dating Ancient Events 161
charts, construct the graph of L(T0 , T) for each T0 where L(T0 , T0 ) equals the number of features first appearing on a map T0 , whereas L(T0 , T) indicates how many of them remained on the chart T. We should assume an ordering of the charts to be chronologically correct if all the graphs of L(T0 , T) are close to that represented in Fig. 24 (and incorrect otherwise). In particular, charts which seem to be visually close turn out to be close in time, too: Each epoch is characterized, as can be seen, by its unique set of maps. The verification of the principle has been made more complicated by the fact that few ancient charts survived up to the present time. Nevertheless, a sufficient number of charts permitting us to verify the model were collected. Those of the 3rd-4th century turned out to be quite primitive and rather far-fetched; their quality then improves steadily until, in the 16th century, we encounter sufficiently correct maps, and even globes dating from the 17th century. Meanwhile, the quality improved extremely slowly. For example, the geographical knowledge of 16th-century Europe was still very far from that of today. One map signed in 1522 by T. Occupario represented Europe and Asia in proportion sharply contrasting to the modern Europe: Greenland is a European peninsula there, Scandinavia elongated into a thin strip, the Bosphorus and Dardanelles greatly extended, the Black Sea distorted vertically, the Caspian Sea drawn in horizontal direction and literally made unrecognizable, and so forth. The only region reflected more or less correctly is the Mediterranean; still, Greece is represented as a triangle without the Peloponnese. The ethnographical data on this and other maps of the time are yet much farther from those fixed by traditional history. For example, Dacia and Gottia (land of the Goths?) are placed in Scandinavia, Albania on the Caspian Sea, and China is completely absent, the Judei are in Northern Siberia, and so forth. A map of Cornelius Niccolai (1598) abounds in similar distortions, but now to a lesser degree. Finally, a globe of the 17th century in the Moscow History Museum already reflects the true geographical position quite well. The method permits us to date maps, including "ancient" ones, according to the procedure described above. The obtained results may be quite unexpected. We illustrate this with some typical examples. (1) The famous chart from the Geography by Ptolemy, ed. Basileae, 1545, which is regarded today as ancient, does not fall into the 2nd century, but the 15-16th century, i.e., the time when Ptolemy's book was published. This fact makes us recall quite a similar situation with the Almagest (see above). (2) The no less famous ancient chart Tabula pentingeriana (see e.g., [l), pp. 232-233, Fig. 48) falls not at the turn of the millennium, i.e., time of Augustus, but into the 11-12th century. The divergence from the traditional dating is more than 1,000 years. (3) Series of ancient maps (which are, though, later reconstructions from verbal descriptions in ancient texts; see (75]) by Hesiod (dated traditionally to the 8th century s.c.). Hecataeus (6-5th century B.c.), Herodotus (5th

the "globe" of Crates (168-165 B.c.) if dated by the above method, then fall into the 7-13th century.

Blair's (6) and 14 other tables (see above) were completed with the information from 222 texts, chronicles, annals, and others, containing together the description of practically all basic events occurring in the indicated regions from 4000 B .c. to A .o. 1800 if dated traditionally. All this information (wars, kings, basic events, empires, etc.) was then represented graphically as the global chronological diagram (GCD) constructed on the horizontal "time" axis. Each epoch with all its events was represented in detail by the lists and dates at the corresponding place on the time axis. We then applied the dating of events and duplicate-recognition methods described above and in [2)-[5] and, in particular, computed the values d(X, Y) for different pairs of surveying historical texts X, Y embracing large time intervals. The quantity A(M, H) for the different dynasties M, H from the GCD, the coefficients L(P, H), and values measuring the enquete-code proximity were also calculated. This extensive experiment unexpectedly led to the discovery of pairs of epochs regarded as independent by traditional history, but for which the coefficients d{X, Y), A(M, H), etc., turned out to be extremely small and characterizing necessarily dependent epochs, texts, dynasties or enquete-codes. We illustrate this with an example.
13.2. Duplicates
It was discovered that the history of ancient Rome in 753-236 B.C. overlapped with that of the medieval one in A .D. 300-816. More precisely, the epoch (A, B) from 300 to 816 was described, for example, in the fundamental work of F. Gregorovius, History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages; the epoch (C, D) from the year 1 to 517 since the foundation of Rome (which occurred, as is thought today, in 753 B.c.) is described in the following two texts. The History of Rome by Livy from the year 1 up to 459 since the foundation of Rome; Livy's text breaks off at that point, and the other books are lost. Therefore, the end of the period (C, D) from the year 459 to 517 since the foundation of Rome was "covered" by the monograph of V .S. Sergeev Essays on the History of Ancient Rome by extending Livy's text. Meanwhile, we have based ourselves on the discovered strong correlation of Sergeev's text
with that of Livy with the proximity coefficient d = 2 • 10- 12 (see above and Fig. 20).



§13 Construction of the Global Chronological Diagram 163
The computation of d(X, Y), where X is the text of Gregorovius (medieval Rome), and Y the sum of Livy's and Sergeev's (ancient Rome) texts, yields
d(X, Y) = 6 • 10-11 . However, if we drop Sergeev's text and compare the text
X' = part of Gregorovius' text from 300 to 758- and the text Y' = part of the History of Rome by Livy from the year 1 to 459 since the foundation of
Rome, then we can compute that p(X', Y') = 6 · 10-10 . Both results indicate the dependence of the two epochs described in the modern textbook, namely, the antique and the medieval one; more precisely, dependence of the primary sources describing them (on which all the later texts are based). This dependence is expressed vividly and is of the same character as that between the texts describing the same events (see Fig. 31).

All such epochs (A, B) and (C, D) that are anomalously close from the standpoint of the coefficient d(X, Y) have been marked on the GCD. We call such epochs d-dependent and represent them by the same symbols.
13.3. Dependent dynasties
An independent experimental investigation of the GCD was then also carried out on the basis of the dependent dynasty recognition method, for which lists of all the rulers from 4000 B.C. to A.D. 1800 for the indicated regions have been made (see [61). The method described in Section 3 was applied to this collection {each of the dynasties consisting of 15 kings). The experiment has unexpectedly led to the discovery of the special pairs of dynasties M and H earlier regarded as independent (in all respects), but for which the proximity coefficient Jt(M, H) is of the same order as for a priori dependent dynasties, i.e., it oscillates from 10-12 to 10-8 . Let us give several examples. By a dynasty, we understand a sequence of actual rulers of a country without regard to their titles and relations. Due to



164 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
the existence of co-rulers, difficulties in arranging dynasties in a row sometimes arise; the simplest principle of their ordering, i.e., with respect to the midpoints of the periods of their rules, has therefore been adopted. We call a sequence of rules in the history of a state a dynastic stream, and its subsequences obtained by rejecting some particular co-rulers dynastic jets. It was required of a jet that it should be monotone (i.e., the midpoints of the periods of the rules making up a jet should be monotonically increasing) and complete (i.e., gap-free and covering the whole period embraced by the stream, with overlapping being permitted). Understandably, these requirements may not always be satisfied in real situations. For example, a chronicler's story may omit the year between two rules, and so forth. Therefore, we should admit insignificant gaps (no more than one year long) and the three types of errors described and modelled in [5]). There is another reason for which a precise formal picture can be distorted: It is sometimes difficult to establish with certainty the start of a rule (e.g., to count from the moment of actually starting the rule or formally ascending the throne), whereas there are usually no difficulties about its end: In most cases, it is the ruler's death. For example, sources supply different dates for the enthronement of Frederick II, namely, 1196, 1212, 1215 and 1220, thus making it necessary to "double" the king or to consider him even in a larger number of versions, all included in the general dynastic stream. Meanwhile, it was required that no jet should contain two different variants for the same ruler. We now give examples of dependent dynasties.
(1) M = Roman Empire actually founded by Lucius Sulla in 82-83 B.C. and
ending with Caracalla in A.D. 217; H = Roman Empire restored by Lucius
Aurelian in A.D. 270 and ending with Theodoric in A.D. 526 (>.(M, H) =
10- 12); the dynasty M is obtained from H by shifting the latter backwards by ea. 333 years).
(2) M = Dynasty of kings of Israel in 922-724 B.C., described in the First
and Second Book of Samuel and the First and Second Book of Kings; H =
Jet from the Roman Empire in A.O. 300-476 (>.(M, H) = 1.3 • 10- 12 ).
(3) M = Dynasty of the kings of Judah in 928-587 B.C., described in the First and Second Book of Samuel, and the First and Second Book of Kings;
H = Jet of the Eastern Roman Empire in A.O. 300-552 (,\(M, H) = 1.4 ·
10-12).
All the pairs discovered by our method turned out to be close to those given in [1], though ours are sometimes substantially different (especially in the case of the third dynasty) from those suggested there on the basis of a simple selection. The fact that the three pairs of [1) did not turn out to be optimal in the sense of ,\(M, H) is related to Morozov's basing his conclusions on the "visual similarity" of the dynasty graphs. Our analysis has demonstrated that several dozen such and even more "outwardly similar" and necessarily independent pairs of dynasties can be exhibited; hence, the problem arose of finding a quantitative method for separating dependent pairs from clearly independent ones.



§13 Construction of the Global Chronological Diagram 165
All the other pairs of dependent dynasties listed below, and also those indicated in the GCD, were unknown earlier, and I discovered them while investigating the material of the GCD by means of the above methods.
(4) M = Dynasty of popes in 140-314; H = Dynasty of popes in 324-532;
A( M, H) = 8.66 •10-8 • This pair is perfectly consistent with pair 1.
(5) M = Empire of Charlemagne from Pippin of Heristal to Charles the
Fat, i.e., in 681-887; H = Jet of the Eastern Roman Empire in 324-527,
A(M,H) = 8.25 -10- 9 •
(6) M = Holy Roman Empire in 983-1266; H = Jet of the Roman Empire
in 270-553; A(M, H) = 2.3 · 10- 10. The dynasty H is obtained from M by shifting the latter backwards by ea. 720 years.
(7) M = Holy Roman Empire in 911-1254; H = German Roman Empire
of the Habsburgs in 1273-1637(!); A(M, H) = 1.2 · 10-12. The dynasty M is obtained from H by shifting the latter backwards by 362 years as a solid block.
(8) M = Holy Roman Empire in 936-1273; H = Roman Empire from 82
217; A(M, H) = 1.3. 10- 12 .
(9) M = Dynasty of the kings of Judah in 928-587 B.C. (First and Second
Books of Samuel and First and Second Books of Kings; see also Pair 3); H =
Jet of the Holy Roman Empire in 911-1307(!), A(M, H) = 10- 12 .
(11) M = Dynasty of the kings of Israel in 922-724 B.C. (First and Second
Books of Samuel and First and Second Books of Kings); H = Formal dynasty of the Roman coronations of German emperors in Italy in 920-1170(!);
A( M, H) = 10-8 , meaning the Roman coronations of the emperors of the Saxon, Salian, Frankish, and Swabian (of Hohenstaufens) of the German dynasties. The two latter pairs are especially startling, since they signify an overlapping of the history in the Old Testament with the medieval Roman-German history in the 10th-14th century. This overlapping differs by ea. one thousand years from that suggested in [1], and by two thousand years from traditional chronology. Other examples of special dynasty pairs are demonstrated in the GCD (see below). Thus, for example, we cannot help stressing the striking overlapping of the history of medieval Greece in 1250-1460 with part of the history of ancient Greece in 510-300 B.C.
13.4. The agreement of different methods
After all dynasty pairs in the GCD have been investigated, all the special (dependent) dynasty pairs M and H, such that A( M, H) is of the same order as for certainly dependent dynasties, i.e., from 10-8 to 10-12 , have been denoted by identical symbols. The GCD with this additional structure turned out to coincide with the one on which all pairs of epochs proximal in the sense of the coefficient d(X, Y) have been marked. An extremely important fact is valid, namely, the application to the GCD of all dating methods worked out leads to the same result: Though obtained by essentially different methods, the dates



166 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
are consistent. In particular, epochs close in the sense of d{X, Y) are also close in the sense of >-{M, H), and also in the sense of the coefficient measuring the proximity of the dynastic enquete-codes. Moreover, the obtained results are consistent with astronomical dating; they are also fully consistent with the forward shift of "ancient" eclipses, discovered in [1]. By way of example, we describe part E of the GCD from 1600 B.C. to A.O. 1700 for Italy, Germany, and Greece. The result is given as the line E, in which historical epochs have been denoted by letters. Here duplicates ("repetitions"), i.e., epochs duplicating each other (i.e., close in the sense of our methods) are denoted by identical letters. Due to the very extensive data, we give only a rough sketch; (see also Fig. 32 with a time scale). This chronicle line E (part of the "modern textbook" GCD) contains obviously repeating duplicate epochs and can be resolved into a simple composition of three shifts of four practically identical chronicles. Thus, we can write
schematically that E =C1 + C2 + C3 + C4.
13.5. Three basic chronological shifts
It is important that all four lines, each of which represents a certain chronicle made up of fragments of the "modern textbook" GCD, are almost identical. One of the explanations of this basic result we obtained can be the fact that the "modern textbook" of ancient and medieval European history is a "fibred" chronicle derived by gluing together the four practically identical replicas of the shorter chronicle C1 . The other three chronicles C2 , Ca, and C4 are obtained from C1 by shifting it as a rigid block backwards by 333, 1053, and 1778 years. In other words, the entire "modern textbook" can be completely restored from its lesser parts C1 or C0 wholly placed to the right of A.O. 300. Moreover, practically all information in the chronicle lines C0 and C1 turns out to be situated to the right of A.O. 960, i.e., each epoch of history, placed to the left (below) of A.O. 960, is a "reflection" of a certain later historical epoch wholly placed to the right of A .o. 960, and which is the
"original" of all the duplicates generated by it. The fragments K, H, and II of the original line C0 contain very little information, and the principal part of C0 is concentrated in the fragments P, M, T, and C placed to the right of A.O. 920-960.
The principal result of the research I carried out in 1974-1980 is that this assertion is valid not only for the line E (reflecting the history of Europe), but also for the whole GCD. Recall that the epochs designated by the same symbols are duplicates, i.e., consist of the "same" events. For example, this can also be applied to the following wars, namely, the Trojan war, the war with the Tarquins in Rome, the war between Sulla, Pompey, and Julius Caesar in Italy, the Gothic war in the middle of the 6th century A.O. in Italy, the war in Italy in the middle of the 13th century (fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, establishment of the House of Anjou). This latter war and the fall of Constantinople in 1204 (the

Fourth Crusade) are probably the "original" of all the other wars denoted on E by the symbol T. In my opinion, the resolution discovered in the GCD into the sum of the three shifts can be explained naturally. The process of creating the global chronology and history of ancient times started in the late Middle Ages: The historical data accumulated until that time was ordered for the first time, namely, it was separated into chronicles, annals, and so forth; however, while "patching" all these pieces together into a unique diagram, an error was made, namely, the four replicas of the same chronicle (C1 or C0 ; see above), in general describing the same history of Europe and the Mediterranean, were regarded by the chronologists as being different, i.e., speaking of different events, due to which they were "patched" together not in a parallel fashion as it should have been done, but in series, with shifts of 333, 1053, and 1778 years. The "shorter chronicle" C1 has thus been converted into the "longer chronicle" E, i.e., the "modern textbook" of ancient and medieval history. I made clear the reasons which might have led to such a confusion and which generated just these and not any other shifts. Since the analysis of the material requires lengthy digressions into history and is far outside the framework of the present treatise, it is omitted here (for details, see Vol. 2).
13.6. Biblical history and European history
13.6.1. Volume graphs for the Old Testament and the "European textbook" for 850 B.C. to A.D. 1400. The "modern textbook" GCD also possesses other portions that differ from E, contain duplicates and are resolvable into the sum of several "shifted chronicles". This can be applied to biblical history, too. We have already mentioned above that the Bible contains many duplicates (see the line B). It was not accidental that in the description of B we had used the same letter symbols as for the "European" line E. As a matter of fact, B turns out to be completely coincident (identical) with the part of E, describing Roman-Greek-European ancient and medieval history. More precisely,
E = T I< T H T ( line B )

This overlapping of B and part of E, if the time scale is taken into account, is shown in Fig. 32. It can be seen that the line B (Old and New Testament) overlaps with the part of the "European textbook" E from 850 B.C. to A.D. 1400.; However,
since the Bible contains many duplicates, the entire Old Testament as well

§13 Construction of the Global Chronological Diagram 169
as the "modern textbook" E can be completely restored from its lesser part, namely, be placed to the right of A.O. 300. Moreover, in reality, practically all of the Old Testament, just as the whole Bible and line E, can be restored from its part describing the events traditionally dated by 960-1400. Meanwhile, the New Testament probably describes the events occurring in the 11th century in Italy. It follows from the structure of the discovered duplicates that, in particular the epoch of Jesus, the turn of the millennium is a duplicate of the "epoch of Hildebrand", the famous Gregory VII (11th century). It is precisely "Hildebrand's epoch" that opens the Crusaders' era marked by the famous separation of the churches in A .D. 1054 and begins the new, Reformation Church in Europe. Overlapping of the line B (Old Testament) with part of line E was obtained by me by formally applying the above methods. We shall demonstrate this by the volume graphs compared by means of the coefficient d(X, Y) (see above). Consider the interval from 800 B.C. to A.O. 1300 in Italian and European history. We take the sum of two fundamental monographs, namely, Niese [14] from 800 e.c. to A.O. 552 and Gregorovius [53] from A.O. 300 to 1300. Combining the two sources, we obtain a text X now describing the whole interval (A, B). We then break X into the union of fragments X(T), which
permits us to construct the volume graph for the chapters X (T) in the whole interval from 800 B.c. to A.O. 1300, i.e. 2,100 years long. We now consider the Old Testament (Chapter generations 1-170). The Chapter volume graph should be constructed and compared with the corresponding graph for X, the difficulty being that the Bible has no time scale which would be sufficiently detailed. However, as has already been indicated, the Bible admits a practically unique decomposition into the chapter generations B(T), where the ordinal number T varies from 1 to 218. Consider the first 137 chapter generations, i.e., from Genesis to the Second Book of Kings. Since the First and Second Books of Samuel and Kings duplicate the First and Second Books of Chronicles, Chapters 138-167 duplicate Chapters 98-137; therefore, we are not interested in them now. Chapters 103-137 have been described in the First and Second Books of Kings with detailed chronological indications, which permits us to determine the length of the described time interval to rather considerable accuracy: It is 341 years (see also how the same interval has been measured in [7]). Such circumstantial chronological information for the remaining Chapters 1-102 is absent in the Bible; hence, to find the time interval described, we have to do it in a rather rough manner. The analysis of Chapters 1-102 has shown that while describing the events of one generation, almost every one relates the latter to some principal historical figure, i.e., a "ruler", whose "rule" can be taken as the "duration" of the generation. We have already said earlier that the mean duration of a rule equals 17.1 years in the whole of ancient and medieval history fixed in written sources, i.e., approximately 17 years. Basing ourselves on this mean value, we obtain that the period "covered" by 102 generations can be estimated to be



170 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
approximately 102 -17 = 1734 years long. Thus, we·can assume that the period described in the "historical part" of the Old Testament (without moralistic
texts) is 1734 + 341 = 2075 years. We see that this figure turns out to be
extremely close to 2,100 years, i.e., the period described in the text X (see above). Therefore, we can compare the chapter volume graphs for X and the Old Testament, for which we have to refer the texts to one and the same scale.
The simplest of them may be the partition of the whole (A, B) = 800 B .c. to A.D. 1300 into 19 line segments, arising if we single out in (A, B) all the epochs T discovered above while analyzing the GCD. The bounds of the obtained 19 segments are 800, 770, 750, 520, 509, 380, 100 B.c., and A.O. 14, 98, 235, 305, 493, 552, 715, 901, 1002, 1054, 1250, 1268 and 1300. Since the line segment (A, B) may overlap, because of the same length, with the period described in the Old Testament, we obtain the corresponding division of the Chapter-generation sequence 1-170 in B into the following 19 groups, namely, the period from 800 to 770 B.C. is not described, that from 770 to 750 B.C. corresponds to Chapter Generation 1, from 750 to 520 B.C. to Chapters 2-14, from 520 to 509 B.C. to Chapter 15, from 509 to 380 B.c. to Chapters 16-23, from 380 to 100 B.C. to Chapters 24-39, from 100 B.C. to A .D. 14 to Chapters 40-46, from A .o. 14 to 98 to Chapters 47-50, from A.O. 98 to 235 to Chapters 51-59, from A.O. 235 to 305 to Chapters 60-62, from A.O. 305 to 493 to Chapters 63-73, from A.O. 493 to 552 to Chapters 7478, from A.O. 552 to 715 to Chapters 79-88, from A.O. 715 to 901 to Chapters 89-97, from A.O. 901 to 1002 to Chapters 98-102, 141, 142, from A.O. 1002 to 1054 to Chapters 143-147, from A.O. 1054 to 1250 to Chapters 148-162, from A.O. 1250 to 1268 to Chapter 163, and from A.D. 1268 to 1300 to Chapters 164-167. At the end of the list, we made use of the fact that Chapters 141-167 duplicate Chapters 103-137. Thus, we introduced the same time scale in both texts X and B. After having calculated the volumes of fragments which described each of the 19 intervals, they were averaged, i.e., divided by the length (in terms of generations) of the interval. For example, the volume of Chapters 2-14 describing Interval 1 equals 59 verses, whereas the length of the interval spans 13 generations, and the average value of the volume per
one generation equals 59 + 13 =4.54 (see the graphs in Fig. 33, top). All the local maxima (peaks) of both volume graphs are indicated in black. It is extremely surprising that all of them, except one, occur at the same points. It is also important that all epoch duplicates of the series T, designated by triangles in Fig. 33 (bottom), almost coincide with the peaks of the unaveraged volume graph constructed for the biblical Chapters which were determined for Generations 1-137. It can be seen that all the triangles are placed close to the basic peaks of the volume graphs. In particular, all these duplicate epochs of the series T immediately stand out from the entire quantity of the biblical chapter generations at least because their volume graph exhibits local jumps, or peaks. Duplicates of the form Tare those described best of all among the Chapters on line B. Following the method of [2] for calculating

p(X, Y), we can estimate the nearness of these two series of peaks for both graphs quantitatively. Let us calculate the lengths of the intervals into which they break the
sequence of Chapter-Generation groups 1, 2, ... , 19. We obtain d(X, Y) =
1.4 • 10-4 , which indicates that the texts X and B are dependent for eight maxima. This proximity is SQ close that it is the least possible for two noncoincident vectors in the discrete model (see [2]), since they diverge in only one



172 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
coordinate. Hence, within the framework of the maximum correlation principle, X and B describe the "same" events, which certainly sharply contradicts today's view of the contents and relative historical epochs.
13.6.2. The overlapping ofsome biblical and European events. Babylonian captivity and A vignon exile. Overlapping of the described historical events, occurring in X and the Old Testament, implies, in particular, that of the kingdom of Israel and Judah, described in the First and Second Book of Samuel and Kings, the First and Second Book of the Chronicles, coincides with part of the Holy Roman Empire in 962-1300, which is ideally consistent with the independent overlapping obtained above on the basis of the independent duplicate dynasty recognition method. These dynasties overlap due to the anomalous smallness of the coefficient ..\(M, H), which indicates a dependence of the dynasties. Let me stress once again that all the chronological results obtained by the described methods are perfectly consistent with each other, which is a serious argument for the objectivity of the duplicate system discovered. Overlapping of biblical and European (in particular, Italian and German) events leads, inter alia, to the following identifications. The famous events under King Zedekiah (war with Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar, the fall of the kingdom of Judah, capture of Jerusalem and Babylonian captivity) overlap with those at the end of the 13th century in Italy, namely, the war in Italy, capturing of Rome, transfer of the pontificate to Avignon, and complete subordination of the papacy to the French crown ( "exile of the popes"). The biblical 70-year-long Babylonian captivity is a reflection (duplicate) of the 70-year-long Avignon exile of the popes in 1305-1376 (6]. The medieval authors in the 14-15th century confirm our conclusion, calling the Avignon exile of the popes "Babylonian captivity" (see, e.g., [81) p. 112). In particular, Dante wrote in a letter to the Roman king Henry, dated April 16, 1311, discussing the Avignon exile of the popes, that the heritage, which, being deprived of it, they continued to be feel sorry for, will be returned to them fully. And, similarly to their yearning for holy Jerusalem (Rome?), the Babylonian exiles (in Avignon!) having become citizens, will joyfully remember the suffering of the turbulent years. The further biblical events described in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther (return to Jerusalem, "restoration of the temple") are reflections of the corresponding events in Italy in 1376-1410 (return of the pontificate to Rome). For the convenience of comparing the biblical and European events, we decode the letter symbols of line B (Bible), indicating the plot of the corre
sponding biblical legend for each of them. Thus, B = T: legend of Adam and Eve; J(: Cain and Abel, Enoch, lrad, Methushael, Lamech, Seth, Enosh, Canaan, Mahalalel, Jared; T: Noah, the Flood, destruction and rebirth of mankind; H: Shem, Ham, Japheth, "sons of Japheth;'' T: Babylonian captivity, dispersing mankind all over the world;

To identify these events with the corresponding European ones, we have to turn our attention to Fig. 32, in which line B is represented above, and compare its symbols with the corresponding expansions of the "European" symbols. It follows from the decomposition of the GCD into the sum of four chronicles that nearly all of the "modern textbook", referring to dates earlier than A.O. 900, consists of duplicates whose "originals" occurred in A.O. 900-1600. In particular, each event described in the "modern textbook" before A.D. 900 is the sum of several (mainly, two, three, or four) later events. To find the authentic dates when these events did occur, we have to draw a vertical line and mark those events which it cuts out of the four chronicle lines C1 , C2 , Ca, and C4. In other words, the "modern textbook" is a fibred chronicle glued together from the four pieces shifted with respect to each other and being practically identical. The GCD contains no duplicates, starting only with the middle of the 13th century and later.
13. 7. The beginning of "authentic" history in circa the 10th century A.D.
Duplicates may already be found in A.O. 900-1300, e.g., block C (see Fig. 32), whose inverse image (preimage) is the Empire of the Habsburgs, and placed above A.O. 1300. In particular, the part of the "modern textbook" from 900 to 1300 is the "sum" of two chronicles, namely, a certain authentic chronicle describing actual events in 900-1300 (probably, rather poorly), and another authentic chronicle shifted backwards by ea. 300 years and describing the events of the time of the Habsburgs, 1300-1600. Global chronology was created at the end of the 16th century or at the beginning of the 17th century, where the last period C "dropping" backwards due to chronological errors and generating duplicates "in antiquity" (see the



174 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
letters C in the GCD) ends just here, which is very important and means that no events subsequent to the times of Scaliger and Petavius were shifted backwards. On the other hand, many events up to this epoch were dropped backwards. It is probable that the last event dropping backwards was the activity of the creator of chronology Petavius, or Petit. Translated from the French, it means "little", i.e., Dionysius Petavius is Dionysius the Little, the famous chronologist who lived in the 6th century A.O. It is probably he who may be called the "reflection" of Dionysius Petavius in his being dropped backwards by ea. 1,000 years. The whole of the GCD is a fibred document; many events regarded as ancient are the sums of several later events described in the chronicles C2 , C3, and C4 glued to C1. The application of our methods to A.D. 1300-1900 did not lead to the discovery of any duplicates at all, which demonstrates the validity of the historical scheme from 1300 to 1900. The "textbook" GCD arose from the shorter chronicle C1 (or C0 ) not due to some global falsification, but, probably, due to three simple chronological errors, one of which was the confusion between the dates of the foundation of two Romes, namely, in
Italy and on the Bosphorus (Constantinople = New Rome). The resolution of the GCD into the sum of four chronicles supplies the answer to the two fundamental problems, namely, what "authentic" history was, and how the "modern textbook" was obtained from it. Apparently, "authentic" history starts with ea. the 10th or 11th century A.O. (or even later); before the 10th century, there are quite insignificant data referring to A.D. 300-1000. All the other epochs mentioned in the "modern textbook" as dated to earlier than the 10th century A.D. are various reflections of the events in the 10-17th century. Biblical New and Old Testament history is placed in the interval from the 10th to the 15th century.
13.8. The chronological version of Morozov and the author's conception
The author's conception is different from the version of Morozov as much as his theory differs from the traditional one. For example, according to Morozov, the basic biblical events occurred in the 3rd-5th century, which is approximately 1,000 years later than the traditional dating, whereas, due to the results obtained by our methods, they occurred in the 10-15th century, i.e., ea. a millennium later. My conception given here completely rejects the hypothesis formulated in [1] that most of ancient texts are allegedly Renaissance fabrications. As seen from the GCD, all those written just before and during the Renaissance describe the authentic contemporary events and are in no way fabrications; for example, Ptolemy's Almagest. Morozov's main accusation that the book had been forged was that it had been speaking of the astronomical observations under the Roman emperor Antonius Pius, whereas the authentic data (we mean here the Latin text; see above) explicitly point to the 16th century. However, there is no contradiction. The Roman emperor Antoninus Pius turns out to be



§13 Construction of the Global Chronological Diagram 175
placed in 1524-1547 (whereas dated traditionally, his rule was in 138-161 [61)
under the total forward GCD shift by 1,053 + 333 = 1,386 years (see Fig. 32). It is surprising that "Antoninus Pius" is placed exactly in the epoch of the first editions of the Almagest, the Latin one in 1537, the Greek one in 1538, and the "translation" of George of Trebizon in 1528, published under "Antoninus Pius", who was mentioned in the text. The author of the Latin edition deceived no one, writing into the book the name of the ruler at the time of the observations. We have a remarkable opportunity to verify the result by another independent technique. With the Roman Empire in the lst-3rd century being overlaid on the 10-13th century and the Habsburgs (see the GCD), we can attempt to directly indicate a Habsburg whose name was "Pius". The epoch just before the first edition of the Almagest, the beginning of the 16th century, is "covered" by Emperor Maximilian I (1440-1519). At least part of the astronomical observations had to be made just in his time if the edition of the book followed immediately after it had been written. The complete name of this emperor turns out to contain the names Kaiser, Pius, and Augustus (Fig. 9(2)). The epochs of Alberti and Vitruvius ideally coincide upon shifting the GCD in the indicated manner [1]. We now describe the mechanism of a possible error which led to the "modern textbook" being obtained from the shorter chronicle C0 •
13.9. The confusion between the two Romes
The first chronologist (possibly, in the 13th or 14th century) possessed several documents of approximately the same contents, describing the same Roman history, e.g., several versions of the type of Livy's History of Rome. Written by different people and from different points of view, in different languages, with the use of different names or nicknames for the same historical figures (kings), these chronicles were outwardly sharply different. The natural problem of relating these documents to each other arose; in particular, the chronologists faced the problem on which basis such a relation should rest. One of the suggested methods was, probably, as follows. In many chronicles, years were counted from the "foundation of the City (Rome)"; see, e.g., Livy's History of Rome. Therefore, to relate documents of this type to medieval chronicles, it sufficed to calculate the date of the "foundation". However, many medieval documents confuse the two Romes, namely, in Italy and on the Bosphorus. It is assumed that Constantine I transferred the capital in ea. 330 A.O. from the Italian Rome to the settlement Byzantium on the Bosphorus, which was officially named "New Rome" [76]. It is only later that New Rome was called Constantinople [76). Both Romes were the capitals of great empires. It had been stressed long ago that the citizens of New Rome stubbornly called themselves Romans (they were allegedly called the Romaics by other people); hence, the Romaic Empire is the Roman Empire (as well as the Italian one). Along with the legend about the capital's transfer from the Italian Rome to the Rome on the Bosphorus, a similar legend speaks about transferring the Empire's capital



176 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
from the Bosphorus to Italy. This attempt was allegedly made in A.D. 663 and again by emperor Constantine (but now Constantine III and not I), who did not complete the enterprise, because he was murdered in Italy [1]. It is generally assumed that the Rome on the Bosphorus was the Greek capital. However, a large percentage of Byzantine coins had Latin, not Greek inscriptions (so did Italian coins). As the famous legend about the foundation of Rome has it, two cities were indeed founded: one by Romulus, and the other by Remus (see Livy). Both founders have similar names; then Romulus "killed" Remus, and only one Rome remained, i.e., the capital (Livy, Bk. 1, 1), which possibly reflects the confusion between the two Rames; so much so that certain ancient chronicles called the founders of both capitals Romulus and Rome, but not Romulus and Remus, which almost identifies the founders' names [51]. See also the Russian edition, 1911, p. 18.1, B. 170-175. It is assumed today that it is always the Rome in Italy that is understood to be the "City" from whose foundation years were counted in Roman documents. But the medieval authors in the 12-14th century were not so categorical. Moreover, in the words of Villehardouin,5
"... the city which was sovereign over all the others, and which the Byzantines willingly called simply 'the City' (!-A.F.), i.e., the city par excellence, the unique city" ([93), p. 14).
Thus, counting years from the foundation of the City may imply Rome on the Bosphorus in many a document. It is assumed that Constantine I transferred many institutions from Rome to Constantinople and ordered the construction of palaces precisely copying the senators' Roman homes. The Byzantine Empire continued to be called the Roman Empire {93]. On the contrary, the backward "influence" of New Rome on the Rome in Italy was great:
"... 7-13th-century Rome was a semi-Byzantine city ... the Greek customs were practiced everywhere; the Greek was the official and even habitual language of the country . . . they continued to resort to Greek for the official acts as well as for correct usage.... The Norman kings were proud to bear the magnificent costumes of Byzantine emperors ... " ([93], p. 19).
The so-called fiction onto which the Byzantines stubbornly held for centuries, claiming that they were authentic Romans, has repeatedly been noted in traditional history. The Byzantine emperors continued to look upon themselves as the only legitimate Roman emperors. With all the Byzantine historians, all the Greeks turned out to be "Romans". Fearing ambiguity, they arbitrarily [!?-A.F .] called the Byzantine Empire Romaic. The name Romania was transferred from the Byzantine Empire to the Ravenna exarchate [77]. It is not accidental that we have discussed the confusion between the two Romes in such a detailed manner. Assume now that an ancient chronicler has
5 Translated from the French-tr.



§13 Construction of the Global Chronological Diagram 177
made a natural mistake ( "without malice") and mixed up the "foundation" of New Rome in A.O. 663 with that in 330 (see above). Then, by making the foundation of Rome in A.O. 330 on the chronicle C1 (see the GCD) coincident with that in A.O. 663 on C2, he let C2 drop 333 years backwards with respect to
C1 (because 333 = 663-330). Then, by patching these two chronicles together, he obtained a "longer" history with duplicates. That was, probably, the reason for the first shift back by 333 years, which led to the creation of "authentic" history. Similar reasons can be indicated also for the other two shifts by 1,053 and 1,778 years. However, we should note that the latter two shifts can, in reality, be generated by the 333-year one. As a matter of fact, certain chronicles in the GCD turn out to have been shifted not by 333, but by 360 years (a difference in 27 years equals the duration of the war (T), the most frequent duplicate in the GCD). The shift by 1,053 years can then be represented as
1053 = 360 + 360 + 333, whereas 1053 + 720 = 720 + 720 + 333 = 1773, which all but coincides with the 1,778-year shift. Thus, it is possible that the three basic shifts are multiple ones, i.e., repetitions, of the first one by 333 (or 360) years.
13.10. A universal mechanism which could lead to the chroniclers' chronological errors
The author's paper New Empirico-Statistical Methods of Ordering Texts and Applications to Dating Problems (97] offers the following, possibly universal, mechanism which could lead to the chroniclers' errors and result in the three basic chronological shifts. Probably, the primary basic dates from which the chroniclers started counting years were written with the literal symbols making up a short verbal formula. The original meaning was soon forgotten. Afterwards, the chronologists decoded the old dates by formally replacing the letters by figures (it is generally known that figures mean letters in ancient
languages), following the standard rules, namely, A = 1, B = 2, etc., and could obtain totally different results. For example, the abbreviation "Xlllth century A.D". could originally have meant X.III, i.e., the "3rd century since Christ", where X is the well-known anagram of Christ. Substituting formally, we obtain a 1,000-year backward
shift. Similarly, A.O. 1500 = 1.500, i.e., the "500th year since Jesus". Meanwhile, the original count was probably made since the times of Gregory VII Hildebrand (11th century A.O.). Consider two other important dates related to him, namely, 1073, the year of his election as pope, and 1075, Cencius' conspiracy and the lunar eclipse at the Crucifixion. Recalculating and translating them into those since the Byzantine creation of the world, we obtain
1073 + 5508 = 6581, and 1075 + 5508 = 6583. Writing the figures in letters
according to the usual rules, we obtain 6581 =:t= S~IlA, 6583 ==t= S~nr. The sign =t= is only regarded today as the sign for "one thousand". However, it may have been a distorted form of the letter "I", i.e., an abbreviation of the word "Jesus". ~ was written in the same manner as 0, and we obtain two
quite meaningful word dates, namely, 6581 = 1S0IlA, 6583 = 1S0Ilr. Indeed,



178 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
IS0IlA = Jesus God Pope Augustus, and IS0Ilr = Jesus God Pope Gregory
(or Hildebrand), where IS= Jesus, 9eov =God, Il = Pope, and A= Augustus. Repeating the procedure in reverse order, we discover the reason which makes the chronologists believe that the "creation of the worId" occurred in 5508 B.C. They just did not recognize the abbreviations of certain important word symbols. A similar mechanism might possibly lay the foundation for the shift of 333 or 360 years. The dates from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century, i.e., during the rule of Emperor Maximilian I (1493-1519), could be written by the chronologists, for example, as follows: MCL.111, which originally meant the "3rd year since Maximilian", where M.C.L. might be spelt out as Maximus Caesar Leo, or Great Kaiser Leo. During a later substitution of figures for Latin letters, an erroneous "date" was obtained, namely, 1153, which differed by 343 years from the authentic one, since 1493 = 1493+3, and 1496-1153 = 343. Thus, the documents using the abbreviated formula M.C.L. at their later decoding were automatically shifted backwards by ea. 340 years. A similar natural "verbal" formula is also the basis for the third chronological shift by ea. 1,800 years. We stress that the letters in the dates are, in fact, separated from each other by periods in certain ancient documents, e.g., on Diirer's prints. After all the ancient chronicles have been "returned home" and placed properly in the 10th-17th century, we obtain that the history of Europe, the Near East, and Egypt is known approximately as much as that of the so-called "young cultures" such as Scandinavia, Russia, or Japan. It is probable that this cultural "alignment" reflects the natural fact that existing civilizations and developing ones were born more or less simultaneously in different regions.
13.11. Scaliger, Petavius, and the Council of Trent. Creation of traditional chronology
We have noted above that the GCD duplicates were discovered only for periods preceding Scaliger's epoch, but not for later ones. Thus, we again see that the times of Scaliger and Petavius are somehow related to the discovered effects in ancient chronology and history. Recall that it was the group of Scaliger and Petavius which had fixed "historical tradition" which laid the foundation of the "modern textbook", the GCD. Scaliger's version happened to be created within the animated chronological controversy at the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century. Moreover, Scaliger's version turned out not to be unique at all. It confronted some other points of view whose partisans have lost the fight. For example, here are some facts regarding certain events of those turbulent times, the epoch of the 30-year European war, chaos and anarchy.
"It suffices to recall the famous chronologist Joseph Scaliger opposing the Gregorian reform" ((78], p. 99).



§13 Construction of the Global Chronological Diagram 179
Its preparation started in A.O. 1514 during the Lateran council. It is assumed today that the principal problem related to the reform was a shift of the equinox. But it is only one of many serious issues debated in connection with the calendar revision. One of the items leading to the greatest controversy was Scaliger's so-called Julian period. The "great" indiction is a 532-year period, which was called indiction (as believed today) in the Byzantine Empire, and the great circle ·in the West.
"It is difficult to determine with sufficient accuracy when and where this period first came into use" [78].
It is believed (the originals of the documents having been lost) that it was known to the paschalists of the council of Nicaea in the 6th century A.O. There also exists a modification of this "Great Indiction", namely, a period of 7,980 years, also regarded as "ancient". However, as suddenly becomes clear,
"... it happened so that this ancient cycle was accepted by the science of chronology only at the end of the 16th century A.O., and then ... said to be 'Julian'. It was introduced into science by the outstanding scientist and erudite J. Scaliger (15401609) in his Opua novum de emendatione temporum .... This work saw the light in 1583, almost simultaneously (!-A.F.) with the Gregorian reform whose adversary of principle the scientist remained until his death. (Here, the creation of a globalchronology ancient-world calendar is already meant-A.F.) Referring to the Byzantine works, Scaliger insisted on the Julian calendar as the only chronological system being capable of supplying a continuous year count in world chronology" ([78], p. 106).
Controversy surrounded the chronology and the whole of Scaliger's conception:
"It is paradoxical in this sense that the very period (of Scaliger-A.F.) indispensable for ... the chronology of our times was looked upon by pope Gregory XIII as unsuitable for calendar purposes" ((78), p. 107)
The famous Council of Trent (1545-1563) took place at the same time. Among other things, the biblical Canon and the famous chronology "since the creation of the world" were fixed just then. In general, the whole epoch is characterized by the struggle with Protestantism.
"The central tribunal of the fuquisition was created in Rome ... and the index of banned books issued. •. • The Council of Trent played an important part in these reactionary measures taken by the Catholic Church. • . . All Protestant works and their teachings were anathemized. . . . The importance of the Council of Trent for the subsequent activities of the Catholic Church was extreme" ([79], Vol. 2, pp. 107-108).
Scaliger's chronological work, playing an important role in substantiating the authority and old age of the institutes of the Catholic Church, which grew out of Roman history, was published just at that time. In my opinion, it is necessary to study the archives of the Council of Trent and to revise all the surviving documents of those turbulent years, which might cast light on the controversy surrounding Scaliger's chronology.

§14. The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History
14.1. Medieval Italy and Rome
Chapter 3
As can be seen from the GCD and its decomposition into the sum of three shifts, almost all documents regarded today as ancient, and describing the events traditionally dated to earlier than A.O. 900, probably duplicate the originals which supplied the account of the 10-l7th-century events. The question arises whether the "ancient world" can be placed in medieval history, i.e., whether we shall not find the position of the allegedly old texts in the Middle Ages, since they are closely packed with the medieval events already known to us. But, as detailed analysis shows, this is not so. First, certain epochs earlier regarded as different should be identified (for example, we need to overlap several dynasties on one another; see Section 4). The similarity of these duplicates has previously been unobserved. Second, many periods of medieval history are in the dark due to the complete (or partial) absence of the corresponding documents "shifted backwards". Their removal and shifting into "ancient times" have immersed many periods of the Middle Ages into artificial darkness. In the 18-19th century, a peculiar point of view spread among the historians that the Middle Ages had been "dark ages".
"The great achievements of antiquity were allegedly forgotten, scientific thought descended to the 'cavemen's level', great literary works of the ancient times lay as a dead weight, and became known only during the Renaissance" ([80], p. 161).
Most of the upper clergy were allegedly illiterate ([80), p. 166). Coin minting stopped, architectural art fell into oblivion, culture everywhere was "running wild", and so on ([80], p. 167). In our opinion, we face not the degradation of the "great heritage of the past", but the birth of civilization gradually creating all those cultural and historical treasures partly dated earlier in the past due to certain chronological errors, mistakingly leading to the illusion of enlightened "antiquity", and leaving some periods of the Middle Ages bare. For example, the existing medieval history of Rome reveals an enormous quantity of obscure passages, contradictions, and obvious absurdities if we consider it at close range, and which can be explained by the distorted chronological idea of the role of the Middle Ages. Due to the leading role of Roman chronology (see above), we now describe in a nutshell the situation of the history of Rome.
"With the overthrow of the Gothic kingdom begins the ruin of the Italy and Rome of antiquity. The laws, the monuments, even the historic recollections of the past fade from memory"((53], Vol. 2, p. 1).
The removal of secular chronicles (e.g., Livy's History) from Roman medieval history has turned Rome into a wholly spiritual city if we look at it from the modern standpoint:
"The metropolis of the universe was converted into a spiritual city" (l53], Vol. 3, p. 3).
F. Gregorovius says that this transformation of the "civil Rome" into the



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 181
"religious City" was declared a great and remarkable metamorphosis in the history of mankind. Speaking of the end of the 6th century A .D., Gregorovius, the author of the most fundamental work [53], declares:
"The following years are hid in obscurity. The chronicles of the time, monosyllabic and dismal as itself, speak of nothing but the havoc ... " ((53), Vol. 2, P. 1, p. 24).
He continues about the middle of the 9th century:
"The papal archives contained the innumerable acts of the church and the regesta" ([53], Vol. 3, P. 1, p. 141).
And then all these documents were lost in the 12th-13th centuries, leading to the large gap in our knowledge about this epoch.
"Did we but possess these regesta, the history of Rome from the seventh to the tenth century would live anew" ([53], Vol. 3, p. 141, note).
"The history of the city, its remarkable transformation since the days of Pipin and Charles, found not a single analyst, and while Germany and France, and even Southern Italy . . . produced numerous chronicles, the indolence of Roman monks allowed the events of the city to remain shrouded in profound obscurity" ([53), Vol. 3, p. 147).
From time to time, the medieval chronicles report about "ancient" facts as of contemporary ones. The historians then start speaking of resurrected remembrance, reminiscences, imitation of the old customs, and so forth. For example,
"... the Romans of the tenth century are frequently designated by curious-sounding names. These names arrest our attention, recalling as they do the monuments of antiquity" ([53), Vol. 3, p. 381).
The discussion of the problem regarding the existence of a senate and consulship in medieval Rome has burst out in traditional history many times. Some believe that all these institutions (regarded as "ancient") also existed in the Middle Ages, whereas the others declare that medieval Romans followed these "ancient customs" under their own momentum, not giving them their earlier meaning. Gregorovius wrote:
". . . the aristocrats, the citizens, the militia •. . swnmoned to their aid from the already myth-enshrouded graves of antiquity the ghosts of consuls, tribunes, and senators, who seem to have haunted Rome throughout the entire Middle Ages.... " ([53), Vol. 2, p. 417).
"... the title consul is very frequent in documents of the 10th century" ((53), Vol. 3, p. 450, note).
And moreover, Emperor Otto (in the 10th century) tried to recover "ancient" and "forgotten" Roman customs. Speaking of the description of medieval Rome, which was given in the famous medieval book Graphia, Gregorovius shamefacedly declares that the Graphia mixes antiquity and medieval reality:



182 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
"The Gra.phia. still calls it Templum ... and relates the legend of the earth being piled up" {[53), Vol. 3).
Medieval chronicles very often speak of the facts which are contrary to traditional chronology; this confirms the three shifts we discovered in the GCD. Thus, it turns out that
"Noah founded ... a city near Rome, which bore the name of the founder .. . his sons Janus, Japhet, and Camese built the town of Janiculum on the Pa.latine... . Janus dwelt on the Pa.latine, and aided by Nimrod . . . built the city of Saturnia on the Capitol" ((53], Vol. 3, p. 526).
"In the Middle Ages a monument in the Forum of Nerva was called Noah's Ark" ([53), Vol. 3, p. 527, note).
All these "absurd" things (from the standpoint of tradition) precisely correspond to the overlap of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah and the Empire of the 10-13th century A.O. in Italy. In general,
"And it is solely by means of this antique character-a character which dominated the city throughout the entire Middle Ages-that many historic phenomena can be explained" {[53], Vol. 3, p. 537).
It turns out that the first lists of Roman monuments were made only in the 12th century and are assumed today to be "... a curious medley of true and false names" ([53], Vol. 3, p. 543). For example,
"The church was dedicated not only to S. Sergius, but a.lso to S. Bacchus, a saint, who, curiously enough, appears on this ancient Pagan site. His appearance, however, was not singular in Rome, where the names of ancient gods and heroes are again found among Christian saints, as S. Achilleus, S. Quirinus, Dionysius, Hippolytus, Hermes ... " ((53], Vol. 3, p. 544).
The history of the world-known architectural monuments of Rome can be more or less reliably traced to not earlier than the 10th or 13th century A .D. For example,
"... for a long time past (after antiquity-A.F.) we have not once heard its name (Capitol). It had vanished from history (at that time, it had not even been builtA.F.)" ([53], Vol. 3, p. 546).
The chaos leading to the complete confusion among "ancient" and "medieval" names reigns over the medieval names of Roman monuments. For example,
"The Temple of Vesta was formerly made into the Temple of a Hercules Victor; the archaeologists have now dedicated it to Cybele; this Goddess will, however (?-A.F.), soon have to withdraw to make room for another divinity, until the latter is in tum banished by an archaeological revolution" ((53), Vol. 3, p. 561).
This more resembles a game than a science.
"Night, however, veils the most exalted spot in history (the Capitol and its suburbsA.F.) for more than five hundred years.... It was merely the inextinguishable tradition



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 183
of all that the Capitol had once signified which now raised it from obscurity, and which, as soon as the spirit of civic freedom was awakened, made it once more (!-A.F.) the political head of the city. As early as the eleventh century the Capitol appears as the centre of all purely civic affairs (among the ruins? Traditional history assures us that the Capitol was destroyed as early as the ~ost ancient past, and has been standing in this practically erased form until the present day-A.F.). The recollection of the sacred spot was revived; the ruins of the Capitol (!-A.F.) reanimated by the assemblies of the nobles and people now usurped the place of the Tria Fata . . . at the disturbances on the election of a prefect, at the acclamation of the election of Calixtus II, it was again from the Capitol that the Romans were summoned to parliament or to arms. It would also appear that the city prefect dwelt on'the Capitol, since the prefect, Henry IV ... , had a seat there . . . and a palace on the hill was used for tribunals . . . (also among the ruins?-A.F.) ... " ([53), Vol. 4, P. 1, pp. 464-465).
Can we accept, even as a hypothesis, that all these assemblies, meetings, elections, arguments, discussions of documents (and keeping them), making responsible state decisions, signing official papers, and so on, had taken place in overgrown ruins and not in special buildings erected just for this purpose, and just at this time, whereas they were destroyed much later, since there were enough "waves of destruction" in ll-13th-century Rome. The mist of orthodox conception veils Gregorovius so densely (he being one of the most serious historians of Rome and the Middle Ages, whose works are always well documented) that he continues his story, apparently not feeling the absurdity of the described picture, which contradicts elementary common sense:
"Sitting on the prostrate columns of the Temple of Jupiter, or within the vaults of the office of the State Archives, among mutilated statues and inscriptions, the monk of the Capitol, the rapacious Consul, or the ignorant Senator might gaze in wonder at the ruins and meditate on the capriciousness of fortune ... " ([53], Vol. 4, p. 465).
Without noticing the comical improbability of such legislative assemblies under popes claiming world supremacy, Gregorovius continues:
"The Senators who went to and fro among the ruins, wearing tall mitres and goldbrocaded mantles, had but a dim idea that here in former time Statesmen had framed laws, orators had ma.de speeches.. . . There is no more bitter satire on all the most exalted things on Earth . . . goat herds already clambered over the marble ruins (and among the Senators sitting on them-A.F.); a. part of the Capitol had even received the degraded name of Goat-hill (Monte Caprino) in the same way that the Forum had been transformed into the Campo Vaccino (not for the Sen&tors?-A.F.) ... " ([53], Vol. 4, P. 2, p. 467).
In confirmation, Gregorovius adds the medieval description of the Capitol, the only primary source up to the 12th century. It is most striking that this text occupying a whole page of a large-format modern book, printed in brevier, reports no destruction and describes the medieval Capitol as a functioning political centre of medieval Rome. Magnificent buildings, temples, and so forth, are mentioned, but no word is spoken about the goat herds lonely wandering among this golden luxury. In the Middle Ages, the Basilica Constantini was called the temple of Ro

(and it all was in the 12th century A.O.) ([53], Vol. 4, p. 586, Comm. 74). Gregorovius dejectedly comments:
"This is the erroneous statement of Ricobald" ((53), Vol. 4, p. 698, Note 2).
The argument is that a similar work of bronze could not have been made in the Rome of the time, with its very low level of artistic development ([53], Vol. 4, P. 2, p. 666). The medieval chronicles very often speak of the ancient way of contemporary Roman life. For example, about the 13th century, it is said:
"As in ancient times, in the days of Camillus and Coriolanus, they (the Roman people-A.F.) undertook conquering expeditions against 'luscany and Latiwn. The Roman insignia, the ancient initials S.P.Q.R.... were seen once more in the field" ([53], Vol. 5, P. 1, p. 164):
The important question arises: What was the Christian cult before Gregory Hildebrand (11th century A.o.)? The study of this problem demonstrates that it coincided with the "ancient" bacchanalian cult. Traditional history retained many traces of this Christian bacchanalian religious service. For example, the medieval papacy and clergy are believed today to have sunk into perversion (famous "agapes", nights of love, which were devoted not to friendly boozing together, but to bacchanalian orgies). Certainly, it was not simple to abolish the bacchanalian cult (due to its attractiveness); Hildebrand gave many years of his life to the purpose. Afterwards, the Inquisition was summoned. The famous medieval descriptions of the "witches' sabbath" imitate the same "agapae" now turned into a "devilish plot" (from the point of view of the Church reformers after Hildebrand). It is natural that the new, Reformation Church, which had originated in the 11th century under Hildebrand, shifted the responsibility for the bacchanalia to the devil in order to stifle in the flock the recollection of its own quite recent cult. In spite of the success of Hildebrand's reforms, the Christian bacchanal cult was still in force for a long time in Western Europe. Here is, for example, Champfteury's Histoire de la Caricature au Moyen Age (see [1] for its analysis). Normally, cartoons resort to certain real features in order to exaggerate them.
"Singular rejoicings took place in the cathedrals and convents apropos the great feasts of the Church during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. At Easter, and especially Christmas, it was not only the low clergy that took part in songs and dances, but the great dignitaries of the Church. In the cloisters, the monks danced with the nuns of neighbouring convents; the bishops went to look for the religious women to engage themselves ii\ their joy" ((101), p. 53).6
Champfl.eury then presents a picture of the monks' meal and their lovers from a Bible(!) of the 14th century, which is kept in the Bibliotheque Imperiale in Paris (n° 166), as the most modest example of a comic cartoon! But how can a "comic picture"-if it is, in fact, a caricature-get into the Bible, a holy
6Translated from the French-tr.



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 185
book? Holy texts have not been made for jokes or laughs; the more so that the other miniatures of this edition do not at all manifest a joker in the illustrator. The miniature presents a typical bacchanalian situation, namely, one of the monks in front is engaged in amorous escapades with a nun, and the same is repeated in the background, but now by a number of monks. There were a great many "caricatures" in the medieval texts and Bibles. By the way, pope Pius II, for example, was the author of a number of pieces of erotic literature and an extremely indecent (from the modern standpoint) comedy Christ ([81], p. 156). We also have to mention the famous Song of Songs included in the biblical Canon, which is pervaded with transparent eroticism (treated as a certain "allegory" by the modern theologians). Trying to accommodate the life of the medieval monks to modern morality and our modern ideas of the religious life of that time, Champfleury assures us that all these pictures and texts should be regarded not as illustrations of something that has really occurred, but as a warning against similar deeds. It sounds strange, because the "warning" is pictured in a very attractive manner. For example, who would warn people against perversion by circulating magnificently illustrated pornography? Most probably, this would have the opposite effect. Moreover, if the warnings had been in earnest, then some particular unpleasant consequences of such practice would have been represented. But there was nothing of the kind there! Similar illustrations (including biblical ones) are only possible in the case where they picture the usual way of life of the medieval priesthood, a fact which at the time of the Middle Ages was regarded as normal by all; and if a painter had made it with the purpose of condemning the customs which had already lost the approval of the new ideology, then, as noted by Morozov, he would have represented the revels in some hideous form, with devils carrying sinners to Hell, with atrocious consequences of terrible diseases, and so on. Instead, many medieval Bibles were illustrated not only with representations of bacchanalia, but also with "antique pictures", namely, vines being climbed by angels indistinguishable from antique cupids, and so forth. I am referring to my personal familiarity with old Bibles (e.g., in the Library of the Moscow Planetarium or Museum of Rare Books at the Foreign Languages Library in Moscow). The synod of Chalon-sur Sa.one forbade women to sing indecent songs in church. Gregory of Tours protested against the monks' masquerades at Poitiers, which were extremely licentious. Champfleury wrote:7
"In 1212, the council of Paris forbade the nuns to celebrate the Jite dea Jon. 'From feasts, where the phallus is accepted, everyone should abstain; still more, monks and nuns are prohibited'" ([\01), pp. 57-58).
The ban helped very little, since a Reformation bishop visiting the Roen monasteries in 1245 reported that nuns in many numbers indulged in illegal
7Translated from the French-tr.



186 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
pleasures at the feasts. Such a bacchanal still continued in Besan~on between 1284 and 1559. Charles VII again forbade this religious fete des fous at the Cathedral of Troyes in 1430. The new evangelical papacy founded by Hildebrand was driving out the deep-rooted bacchanalian cult with extreme difficulties (and for how long!).
"More than once I have looked at the cathedrals, searching for the secret of their disturbing ornamentation, and each motif which I have taken to clarify my text seemed taken from an unknown language."
"What to think of a strange sculpture hidden on a pillar of the underground cathedral of Bourges?" ([1011).
This sculpture represents a man ,s buttocks made thoroughly and expressively, and protruding from a column. It is placed in a spot convenient for love games. How could the priests and believers who regularly came to this temple for prayer tolerate such a sculpture when it had not yet been established as an artifact left from times long past? Attempts to account for these effigies (and there are many!) as "caricatures,,, hewn in stone in holy temples, by those who preach in them cannot be regarded as serious. We quote again from Champfleury:
"It is possible to find an imagination paradoxical enough to determine the relation of enormous facetiae (joke!-A.F.) with the place where they are displayed, and should we not admit the Caprice which has not stopped the worker from the execution of a similar detail?"
"On the walls of certain religious monuments is seen the representation of sexual organs which are displayed complacently in the middle of religious details: echoes of antique symbolism, these priapic symbols were sculptured with innocence by some naive stonemason.... These ithyphallic remembrances of diverse cathedrals in the centre of France are numerous in Gironde, and are characteristic of Bordeaux. Leo Drouyn showed me curious specimens shamelessly displayed in the churches of his province and which he hides in the bottom of his folders.
"Our excess of pudery deprives us of important knowledge. The silence which the modem historians keep with respect to the symbolism of reproductive organs continues to keep a veil over the attitude of those who want to establish the parallel between the monuments of antiquity and those of the Middle Ages. Serious books on the cult of the phallus, important drawings in its support, would vividly clarify the question and would show the thinking of workers in the Middle Ages who were not embarrassed by being reminded of ancient pagan cults" ([101], pp. 239-240).
All these effigies were in no way a humiliation of the Church and pursued the same purpose of attracting new believers-before wide repression of the old cult was waged by the Gregorian church-as the pictures of foaming tankards on the doors of pubs. The famous "antique" pornographic images discovered, for example, in Pompeii [47] are practically indistinguishable from the Christian sculptures and pictures. And again "prudery" hinders wide scientific circles from becoming familiar with a great number of effigies of the sort. It turns out that
". . . those of the pictures, which represent clearly erotic or indecent scenes so much appreciated by the ancients (and also in the Middle Ages-A.F.) are kept under lock



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 187
and key.... Somebody secretly ... scraped off the obscene frescoes at night.... All the pictures and effigies in Pompeii, incompatible with the modem ideas of decency, have been recently placed in the secret department of the Bourbon museum" ([47], p. 76).
Houses with stone phalli at their entrances were discovered in Pompeii ([47], p. 120). The relation of phallic images with the Christian cult cannot be traced exclusively to the European temples.
"In Egypt, too, phalli of monstrous size were hewn of granite.... They were placed at the doors of the temple" ([47), p. 122).
V. Klassowski suggests that these giant stone effigies were placed there for the "pilgrims' edification" (?) ([47], p. 122). The erotic sculptures of the Christian cult can be found on the capitols of the cathedral in Magdeburg, on the walls of the Notre-Dame in Paris, finished in the 12th century, and so on. It is generally known from the archaeology of medieval Rome that practically each of the most important Roman Christian churches was allegedly built on the "ruins" of earlier pagan temples, with these "pagan sanctuaries" being erected approximately for the same purpose and even bearing the same name as the Christian (and "later") temples [53]. In my opinion, by declaring its bacchanalian past (until the 11th century) "erroneous", and by moving on to a new evangelical phase (in the 10th-12th century), the Christian Church simply renamed its prior pagan bacchanalian temples and declared the pagan gods "new" evangelical saints. Certain of the consequences of the three basic chronological shifts which I discovered were stressed by different authors at different times. For example, Gregorovius noted a certain parallel between the ancient and medieval events. The following important statement is valid, namely, that all the instances of the parallel, indicated by him, precisely correspond to the three chronological shifts. We illustrate this by a simple example. Gregorovius directly points to the parallel between the Gothic war in the 6th century A.D. and the war in Italy in the 13th century, being perfectly right in identifying the parallel personages.
"The gloomy Charles of Anjou appeared on the ancient battleground of the Romans and Germans like Narses (!-A.F.}, while Manfred assumed the tragic aspect of Totila (!-A.F.) ... for although the relations of powers were different, the conditions remained essentially the same (!-A.F.).... The Swabian dynasty fell as that of the Goths (!-A.F.) had once fallen. On one and the same classic stage the impressive overthrow of two dominions and their heroes adorned history with a twofold tragedy, of which the second seemed, as it were, to be merely the precise repetition of the first(!-A.F.)" ((53), Vol. 5, P. 2, p. 365).
14.2. Medieval Greece and Athens
The situation with the history of medieval Greece is considerably worse, in the sense of completeness of information, than that of Rome. Like the history of other antique cities, that of Athens is characterized by blooming in



188 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
ancient times followed by immersion into medieval darkness from which the city started to emerge only halfway through the Middle Ages, and later than Rome. Gregorovius wrote that, as to Athens proper, its medieval fate is covered by such impenetrable darkness that the most outrageous opinions have been expressed about the city, such as claiming that Athens turned into an uninhabited coppice in the 6-lOth century, and finally, was burnt out by the Barbarians. Very valid proof~ were supplied of the existence of Athens in the gloomiest epoch. Let us note the remarkable fact that special proof should be required only to prove at least the existence of the most glorious city in the historical country. This fact serves as the startling confirmation of the complete vanishing of Athens from the horizon of history [77). These details about the situation in medieval Athens were first stated by Fallmerayer in the 19th century. To somehow account for this enigmatic "catastrophe", he suggested that the Avars and Slavs massacred all of ancient Greece. However, no sources confirming this are available. Starting with the 7th century A.D., Greece becomes so unimportant for history that the names of Italian towns are much more often mentioned by the Byzantine annalists than Corinth, Thebes, Sparta, or Athens. However, afterwards, too, none of the chroniclers hinted with a single word at the capture or devastation of Athens by invading peoples. Athens did become impoverished, its marine power and political life fell into decay as well as the life of Bellas on the whole. However, the fame of the medieval city was in the hands not as much of the wise men as of honey-merchants. Athens and Bellas were covered by profound night. The "ancient" Parthenon was strikingly turned into a Christian church! The Virgin Mary had already started her victorious war with ancient Pallas over the possession of Athens. The lOth-century Athenians built a beautiful church and erected the image of the Mother of God, whom they called Athene (!-A.F.). Moreover, giving the name of the Mother of God is the same as to give the name of Athene the same name which was later given to the image of Panaghia Athene highly revered in the medieval Pathenon. Thus, besides
the identity Athenae = Mother of God, we discover that the Parthenon was
devoted to the Mother of God, or Athene (77]. Gregorovius continues that the noblest of all cities on earth was hopelessly immersed in the gloomiest Byzantine epoch. With ever-increasing contempt, New Rome on the Bosphorus came to look down on the fallen guiding star of Greece, the small provincial town of Athens. As to the fate of Athens' monuments, they, as a rule, remained in oblivion. For hundreds of years, the Greeks were sitting in total obscurity under the shelter of the ruins of their grey-haired antiquity. Certain of the most beautiful ancient buildings lured the Christians of Athens into rebuilding them into churches. We know nothing of the day when this happened for the first time, and when a temple in Athens was first turned into a Christian house of worship. The history of Athens' churches is very uncertain. Speaking of the Parthenon, Gregorovius adds that the Christian religion drew its attention to the great sacred spot, i.e., the Parthenon, of the antique city goddess on the Acropolis, doing no harm to



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 189
the temple at all. In the entire history of the transformation of ancient beliefs and holy concepts into Christian ones, you will find no example of such an easy and complete substitution as occurred to Athene Pallas when she was replaced by the Virgin Mary. The people of Athens did not even have to alter the nickname of their divine virginal protectress, for the Virgin Mary was now called Parthenos by them (77). Medieval Athens first appeared on the arena of history after many years of nonexistence as a small Byzantine fortress allegedly "restored" by Justinian as early as the 6th century A .o. in the territory fully populated by the Avars and Slavs. No traces of "ancient" Greek Hellenes could as yet be found. In general, according to Gregorovius, the whole Acropolis turned into a holy shrine of the Virgin Mary. We do not possess any factual proofs of existence in Athens of either schools or public libraries. The same darkness veils Athenian civic rule in that epoch. Why did the classical thought "evaporate" from Greece? Where did the "classical" Greeks go? Why did the famous "ancient" marine potential of Athens vanish (by the way, "restored" in the Crusaders' epoch during the 1213th century)? The documents indicate that the Byzantines did not persecute science, and they report nothing of the Inquisition. "Closing" the famous Aeademy in Athens occurred quietly, as Gregorovius stated perplexedly. The term "Hellenes" itself appeared very late in reliable history. According to Gregorovius, it is only in the 15th century that Laonicus Chalcocondylas, hailing from Athens, again christened his compatriots the "Hellenes" after many hundreds of years of nonexistence [77]. Were the Hellenes, as stated by traditional history, slavonized in Greece originally populated only by them, or, on the contrary, were the Avars and Slavs living there in the late Middle Ages hellenized? Theories of slavonizing the ancient Greeks are only based on guesswork. On the other hand, the l0th-century Byzantine historian P. Safafik directly declares that almost all of Epirus and Bellas, the Peloponnese, and Macedon were populated by the Scythian Slavs. Gregorovius continues that, due to similar Byzantine evidence, the slavonization of the ancient Greek lands should be accepted as a historical fact. The Slavonic names of towns, rivers, mountains, and so on, densely covered medieval Greece (e.g., Goritza, Krivitza, etc.), and it is only since the 13-15th century that Greek Hellenic names appeared and were later declared "ancient". Greece first (!) appears on the real political arena as a country of mutiny and with a mixed, more than a half Slavonic population, only in the 8th century. Nevertheless, again after empress Theophano has fallen, Athens, as well as the rest of Bellas, disappears from the historical arena, so that it is even hard to come upon a mention of the city. And only the Peloponnese, where the Slavs settled most firmly, was a pretext for the Byzantines to interfere with Greek affairs. There is still very little information about Greece in the 8-l0th century. Gregorovius declares that neither history nor legend violates the silence enshrouding the fate of the glorious city. This absence of facts
is so complete that those who investigate the signs of life (!-A.F.) in the



190 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
famous city during the centuries described will be glad to encounter, as if a discovery, at least some most insignificant detail similar to that given in St. Luke's biography about a thaumaturgist's visit to Athens (77].
Greece and Athens emerge from darkness only in the 15th century. Greece becomes especially important during the Crusades in the 12-13th century. Possessing a good port, and being a Venetian ally (there are many reasons to believe that Venice should be identified with Phoenida), Athens advances to one of the top positions. It is important that chronological dates were indicated in Greece with reference to the Christian era and in Arabic numerals starting only in A.O. 1600. Gregorovius adds that the influence of time and climate made decoding of these few inscriptions very complicated. They did not even cast any light on Athenian history in the Christian era. The investigator of the medieval Roman past finds himself in an uncomparably more advantageous position (we have already spoken of Rome). The annals of the dead, hewn in stone, are totally absent in Athens. Few tombstones, one or two sarcophagi without any statues, plus several inscriptions are all that is left from the past (not counting the so-called ancient ruins). There are several contradictory versions in traditional history regarding Athens in the 12-14th century. According to one, the city and Greece were still in the dark. According to another, Athens gradually started acquiring importance as a big cultural centre (77]. For example, British scientists studied there. The Crusades were not so much great religious and military ventures as important secular events. The expeditions were headed by high European nobility (see the lists in [77]). Greek territory was converted into the mosaics of feudal states whose role is estimated today essentially from the negative point of view. It is assumed that cruel and ignorant conquerors buried the great heredity of Greece. On the other hand, Gregorovius (just having accused the Crusaders of vandalism) unexpectedly informs us that its new history was just discovered by the Latins, and turned out to be as multifarious as ancient. The Venetian nobiles lusting for adventures set for the Greek seas, turning themselves into the 13thcentury Argonauts (later described by "ancient" poets-A.F.) [77]. Although the history of the Frankish Crusaders' 13-14th-century states in Greece is known fragmentarily, there was a time when fairy tales and legends turned into life. The House of Villehardouin Gottfried II was famed even in the West as a school of most refined customs. The Genoese merchants stayed in Thebes and Athens and successfully competed with the Venetians. This was the era of a remarkable golden age for literature and the arts, of which, though, almost nothing remains. In my opinion, the 13-14th century was the only epoch of "ancient" Greece, which ended in 1453 with the conquering of the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs. As Gregorovius puts it, the situation of the Frankish states in Greece could not be called favourable at the beginning of the 14th century. The Latins led the brilliant life of knights, which can be proved by the convening of the parliament in May 1305 in Corinth. The isthmus, where in the times of old the Poseidon games were staged, has become the arena of knights' tournaments in honour of beautiful women'[77].



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 191
It is important that the Frankish barons decorated their palaces with Greek
inscriptions (!). Adherents to historical tradition themselves stress a great deal of "parallels" between the medieval and ancient Greek states. We will not be able to give their list here, for this will necessitate a chain of extensive tables made while investigating the GCD. We shall illustrate this only by one representative example. Dante's contemporary, Ramon Muntaner, recounted the following event, absolutely neglecting the fact that this event and its dating strongly contradicted traditional chronology and history (though this was established only after his death). According to Muntaner, one Trojan outpost was situated on Atracia, a promontory in Asia Minor, not far from the island of Tenedos, where noble men and women of Romagna used to revere a divinity. When Helen, the consort of the duke of Athens, went to that place accompanied by hundreds of knights, she encountered the Trojan king's son Paris, who killed every orie of her suite of knights and abducted the beauty [77]. I advise the reader to refer to the GCD to discover that the "original" of the famous Trojan war occurred, in fact, in the middle of the 13th century in Italy or at the beginning of the 13th century in Constantinople. It is important that the history of the Greek Frankish states was first studied only in the 19th century. According to W. Miiller, the archives give us only the plot of this romantic drama whose theatre had been Greece for 250 years from the 13th to the 15th century. In the 13th century, the Parthenon served as a "Latin" temple of the Virgin Mary of Athens, "as if it had just been built" {W. Muller) [1]. The famous statue of the Catholic Virgin Mary is placed in the Parthenon as a copy(!) of the world-known statue of the pagan Athene by Phidias (whose loss has been deplored by traditional history). The statue was made in the 13th century. Another "ancient" temple devoted to the virgin, and now called the Erechteon, was also built in the 13th century and is still
acting as if it has just been built, and so forth ([1], Vol. 4). Gregorovius tells us about the famous Byzantine George Gemistus (Pletho), "a resurrected ancient Hellene" living at the court of Theodore II. George was a great worshipper of ancient gods. It was just at that time that the "Hellenistic idea" of calling for the medieval Greeks to unite against conquerors gained ground [77]. Archaeology in Athens began in A.O. 1447, i.e., when Cyriacus of Ancona appeared in the city. He was the first to introduce the world of ruins of Athens to the field of Western science. Cyriacus compiled the first catalogue of inscriptions and local names of monuments. These documents were lost, but the contemporary historians are familiar with his data from a rendering by 15-16th-century authors [77]. According to Gregorovius, the original names of most ancient Athenian monuments now lying in ruins, were forgotten in the course of time. The fantasy of antiquity lovers was anxious to relate them with the names of outstanding men of the past. The remains of the Olympieion were called a "basilica"
in those centuries because, according to Gregorovius, nobody (!) knew that these were the ruins of the formerly world-famous temple of Zeus at Olympia.



192 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Cyriacus called these vast ruins the palace of Adrian as did the citizens of Athens themselves (who, therefore, erred, and only the later historians found the truth and "corrected" the mistake). As early as 1672, Babin did not know where in Athens the temple of Zeus was located. Several years later, J. Spon was just as bewildered. The ruins of the Stoa were attributed to belong to the palaces of Themistocles or Pericles; within the walls of the Odeum, the palace of Herodes Atticus was thought to belong to Miltiades, and other ruins of unknown buildings were assumed to be the houses of Solon, Thycidides, and Alcmaeon. In 1647, Poentelle was shown the ancient ruins of Pericles' palace, and the Tower of the Winds was called "Socrates' tomb". The remembrance of Demosthenes was related to the Monument of Lysicrates. This monument was called "Demosthenes' lamp". The Academia, the Lyceum, the Stoa, and Epicurus' garden vanished without leaving a trace. In the times of Cyriacus, one group of basilicas, or vast ruins whose foundations are now impossible to find, were called the "Academia". The didascalia of Plato "in the garden" was also shown; it seems to be a tower in the Gardens of Ampelocypi. Rumours about some of Caisarini's schools on this mount circulated. The lyceum or didascalia of Aristotle was placed in the ruins of Dionysius' theatre. The Stoa and Epicurus' school were even transferred to the Acropolis, into those big buildings which were, probably, part of the Propylaea, and the temple of Nike seems to have been the one taken over by the Pythagorean school. We do not continue, because the state of archaeological chaos has now become clear, and the list occupies several pages. To think that all this happened in the 16th-17th century! The Byzantine Empire fell in 1453. The last Franks defended the Acropolis for some time; however, infuriated by the stubborn resistance ofthis strong fortress, Omar ordered artillery to shell(!) the Acropolis and its surroundings, due to which its temples, and the Acropolis itself, were turned into ruins [77]. The powerful destruction of many a wonderful monument of the crusaders' epoch led to the Athenian ruins then declared to be "ancient". Gregorovius writes that after the 15th-century Turkish invasion, Athens was again (and how many times it was!) immersed into darkness. During the Turkish yoke, the historian of Athens and Greece faces a problem as difficult as ungratifying. He sees a desert before him [77]. The West has accepted the fall of Greece, and almost forgot it. A German humanist confined himself to a note in 1493 that the city of Athens was most glorious in Attica, from which only few traces remained. In the 16th century, it became necessary for science to possess exact information regarding the fate of the glorious city, which found its expression in the problem whether Athens existed at all. The question was raised by one German philhellene, Martinus Crusius. By rediscovering Athens he made himself immortal. He sent a letter to Zugomalas Theodosios, chancellor of the patriarch of Constantinople in 1573, asking to inform him whether the mother of all knowledge, as stated by the German historians, does exist, that the city of Athens was effaced, with just a few sailors' huts in its place. The reply of the enlightened Byzantine together with the later letter



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 193
of an Acharnian were the first exact data which calmed the German scientist as regards the existence of the city. For the first time, they cast a dim light on the state of its monuments and the flora of its people (in which, according to traditional history, the legend is enrooted that the Parthenon was erected by the architects lctinus and Callicrates under the statesman and strategos Pericles, the popular leader of the democratic party created in Athens as far back as the 5th century B.C. a;nd who died of the plague in 429 B.C. together with its leader, although it is unknown in which month-A.F.) [77]. The scientific archaeology of Athens started only in the 17th century when
Scaliger's chronology had already been created with the works of Jean le Maire from the Netherlands [77]. Nevertheless-let me refer to Gregorovius againeven in 1835, one German scientist expressed the opinion that an uninhabited desert had remained in place of Athens for four hundred years. Compared with the study of the city of Rome, the archaeology of Athens was about two centuries late. The prejudice firmly enrooted in Europe that Athens did not exist, as it were, could be eliminated only with one's own eyes: This was to the credit of the French Jesuits and Capuchins, who first appeared in Athens in 1645 [77].
In the second half of the 17th century, the French monks made the first (!) maps of the city. The continuous and more or less scientific study of Athens began only at this moment when traditional chronology had been almost created, and the Greek monuments had already been dated on the basis of the distorted chronology of Rome, which also led to lengthening Greek history artificially.
14.3. The history of religions
In conclusion, we shall briefly discuss the situation of the history of religions. It is assumed traditionally that each chronological epoch has had its own religious cults separated by centuries and millennia. At the same time, the 19th-century historians and ethnographers did the enormous job of comparatively studying the world religions and cults. They found that the religions traditionally believed to be separated by hundreds and thousands of years admit an extraordinary large number of "parallels" (sometimes even identical coincidences). This fact engendered numerous theories c;,f influence, borrowing, infiltration, and so forth. However, they all rest on traditional chronology and are generated only by it. A change of chronology will make the scientists revise the prior point of view. Since we do not have the space here, we only indicate some typical examples: A so-called Celtic monument found in 1771 is regarded as the traditional representation of the pagan pre-Christian forest-god of the Gauls [37). However, the inscription ESUS carved out over the divinity's head could be seen explicitly. Nevertheless, traditional chronology makes the historians believe that this is the pre-Christian "God Jesus". The well-known historian and specialist in comparative religion A. Drews wrote that he considered mythological



194 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
parallels between Christianity and paganism very important. Those who do not see the generally known relation of the Gospel's paschal history to the myths and cults of the religion venerating Attis-Adonis-Osiris, and others, those who affirm that the myths of Attis and Adonis say nothing of Sunday burials, who hope to prove that Jesus' death was different from the deaths of his relatives in Asia Minor, who cannot recognize the Virgin Mary in the numerous Indian, Anatolian, and Egyptian mother-goddesses Maia, Mariamma, the mother of the "Messiah" Cyrus, weeping Semiramis, Myrrha, and Mera, should be left out of the discussion of questions of religion and history. Drews lists a great many parallels identifying the Christian "holy family" with other "holy families" of the Anatolian and Egyptian gods allegedly separated from the turn of the millennium by many centuries. Rejecting the traditional approach, we see that all the parallels simply point to the simultaneity of these cults, which are different only in national character because of their origin. For example, the principal holy shrine of Mithras had been in the Vatican in the place of today's San Pietro. Mithras-Attis was then called ''father's father". The high priest serving this god was also called "father" (father's father) just as the Roman pope is still called the "Holy Father" (82]. Mithraism as well as Christianity accepts the tenet of purgatory, use of a holy-water basin, and the ritual of crossing oneself. The rituals of public service, Mass, host, wafer of consecration, communion bread, and so forth, are perfectly the same [82]. Mithras' and Christian cults are practically indistinguishable, and the difference between them in hundreds of years is noted only by traditional chronology. It turns out that the mixed cult of the Egyptian goddess. Isis, whose worshippers had matins, liturgies, and vespers surprisingly similar to the Catholic and even partly Orthodox religious services, is nearly coincident with the medieval Christian cult [82] . Without putting traditional chronology to doubt, which has moved the Isis-Osiris-Serapis cult into hoary antiquity, the historian of religions N. V. Rumyantsev had to declare that
". . . this coincidence of prayers of the Egyptian religious service with Christian liturgical prayers is too complete and striking to be accidental" ([83), p. 72).
The "land of crosses" is traditionally believed to be ancient Egypt. The same Christian crosses were spread in ancient India, Mesopotamia, and Persia. A great deal of the Egyptian images of gods contained the anagram of Christ [83. Summarizing his study, Rumyantsev wrote:
"A series of suffering, dying and resurrecting gods of the ancient world have passed before us; we saw their myths, grew familiar with the holidays, rituals, and so forth, devoted to them. In spite of the difference in their names, myths, birthplaces or historical arena, it can still be felt, even against one's own will, that they all have something in common. Moreover, the people of antiquity noticed this fact, too.... In fact, if we look at the recent centuries before and after the so-called Nativity, then we shall notice a curious thing. All the divinities listed above have been closely linked with everything related to them, even sometimes indistinguishably. Osiris, Tammuz, Attia, Dionysius, and others, formed some unique, common, and conjoint image, thus creating a certain syncretic (mixed) divinity almost undividedly reigning over the whole vast territory of



§14 The "Dark Ages" in Medieval History 195
the Roman state.... The divinities, in fact, turned into one Savior with many names. This tight coajunction occWTed especially in the epoch of the Roman Empire and, in particular, in Rome itself" ([83], pp. 44-45).
Egyptian chronology yawns with enormous gaps and is a set of separate fragments quite unrelated to each other or even completely independent. As in the history of Europe, the "restoration" effect can be made manifest in Egyptian history during the Saite restoration when the cults, customs, written language, and so on, forgotten long ago were revived again. Being intimately related with Biblical and Roman chronology, the whole of Egyptian history also undergoes "glueing together" (of "different" Egyptian epochs) and "compression". As a result, the ancient and medieval Egyptian history became shorter, similarly to the history of Europe (see the GCD). The forward shift is consistent with the results obtained independently even by Isaac Newton while investigating the chronology of Egypt (67].
14.4. Indian history and chronology
Oriental history is also linked with that of Europe and Egypt. For example, let us give a short quotation by N. Guseva pertaining to the chronology of India:
"The science of history faces in India such difficulties that cannot even be imagined by the investigators studying the ancient history of other countries and peoples (this was written in 1968-A.F.). The most difficult one of them is the complete absence of dated sources" (see the Russian translation of D. Kosambi's book The Culture a.nd Civiliza.tion of Ancient India in Hi,torical Outline [841).
All the basic chronological milestones in Indian history were established by the comparison with Roman, Greek, and Egyptian chronology. D. Kosambi writes:
"India has virtually no historical records worth the name. . . . In India there is only vague popular tradition, with very little docwnentation above the level of myth and legend. We cannot reconstruct a complete list of kings.... What little is left is so nebulous that virtually no dates can be determined for any Indian personality till the Muslim period.... This has led otherwise intelligent scholars to state that India has no history" ([84], pp. ~10).
The medieval authors sometimes placed India in Africa and even in Italy (!). Similarly to Europe, at the beginning of the millennium, India "suddenly» happens to be at a "barbaric stage of its development", again starting its way to the top level of civilization (84). The golden age of the Sanskrit Indian literature is dated only to the 11th century! Indian medieval history is also rich in chronological gaps as long as a century, being intricate and chaotic.
"Thus, brahmin indifference to past and present reality . . . only erased Indian history. . . . For historical descriptions of ancient Indian scenes and people ... we have to rely upon Greek geographers, Arab merchant travellers•.•. Not one Indian source exists of comparable value" ((84), pp. 174-175).
Thus, Indian chronology and history are completely dependent upon those of Rome and Greece and are restructured following the former.



196 New Experimental and Statistical Methods Chapter 3
Remark. I cannot at all agree with the hypothesis of Morozov, according to which most literary works of antiquity are fabrications of the Apocrypha of the Renaissance, which would mean that what we know today as ancient history is actually the result of premeditated falsification. This thesis for
mulated in [1) caused justified criticism. My standpoint is different, namely that, due to the results of the application of the new dating methods (see above), almost all surviving ancient documents (of antiquity or the Middle Ages) are authentic and were written for the purpose of perpetuating real events rather than leading future historians astray. More than that, certain of numerous examples of the GCD and its decomposition (and also the new version of chronology I suggested) justifying the authenticity of many a document (e.g., of the Donation of Constantine, the Almagest of Ptolemy, etc.) were given above, i.e., many of the documents regarded today as adulterated turn out to be originals, which are extremely consistent with the new version of chronology, following from the GCD and its decomposition into the sum of three shifts. For example, this refers to the "privileges" given by Caesar and Nero to the Austrian duchy (see above). In my opinion, practically everything described in the old documents did, in fact, occur. The problem is when and where? The confusion discovered earlier, which led to the lengthening of authentic history due to the natural chronological error (e.g., because of mixing up the dates of the foundation of the "two Romes"), only took place in solving it. The new version of chronology which I have suggested (and which is essentially different not only from the traditional, but also from Morozov's version) makes us redate the old documents and does not at all deny their validity as true witnesses of the past events.

METHODS FOR THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF NARRATIVE TEXTS
1. The Maximum Correlation Principle for Historical Chronicles and Its Verification by Distribution Functions. Analysis of Russian Chronicles
The coefficient d(X, Y) permitting us to estimate quantitatively the stability of the maximum principle relative to original data perturbations was introduced in Part 1, Ch. 2, §4. We give here a short description of it, and recall the basic related concepts. Let t 1 (X), ... , tp(X) be the years in the time interval (A, B) in which the volume
graph for a narrative text X exhibits splashes (= spikes or peaks). Suppose that
the vector T(X) = (t1(X), ... , tp(X)) is related to the "authentic event" vector
T(A, B), where (A, B) is the period described in the text. If there are two texts X and Y, then the simplest relations among them are described by the diagram
T(X) .- T(A, B)--+ T(Y) and T(A, B)--+ T(X)--+ T(Y).
As the proximity measure for T(X) and T(Y), we can use the following, viz.,
pq
R(X, Y) = Lmin lt;(X) -tj(Y)I + Lmin ltj(Y)-t;(X)I
i=l j=l
For brevity, R(X, Y) will be called in the following the distance between X and Y. I offered V. V. Fedorov from the All-Union Institute of Systems Research, Moscow, to verify the maximum correlation principle by the ordinary statistical methods. In 1981, Fedorov suggested the above function, which turned out to be convenient for computerization and was carried out with the participation of I. S. Shiganov. The meaning of R(X, Y) is extremely simple. We fix a certain maximum for a text X, and find the nearest one of another text Y. We then calculate the distance in years between them, and sum these distances for all maxima of the first text. Interchanging the texts, we repeat the procedure. R(X, Y) is obtained by summing up the results. I have performed the experiments without any further symmetrization of distance so defined, i.e., considering the first and second sum separately, thus being able to construct the non-symmetrical distance matrix.

With such an approach, the number of maxima for two compared texts can be different, and we must not equalize them by introducing the multiple maxima. This choice of proximity measure has been mostly determined by the simplicity of its calculation on a computer. Without doubt, the use of other natural proximity measures is possible, discovering experimentally that they can reliably distinguish between dependent and independent texts. Use a rather standard statistical technique, and find the distribution function f(R) of a random variable R({, TJ) for some collection of
assumptions including that of independence of the vectors T({) and T(TJ). We then find the distance R(X, Y) between two concrete texts X and Y of interest. If the



Verification by Frequency Histograms 3
probability of appearance of such or a lesser distance is small, then it is natural to reject the hypothesis regarding the independence of X and Y, and regard them as related, or dependent in our sense. The computational experiment dealt with 12 texts (see Table 1). We performed the modelling for truncated normal and Poisson distributions. Therefore, we give two probabilities calculated for each of them. The first number is the probability for the normal distribution, and the second for the Poisson distribution. Denote by E the number of maxima of the volume graph, and indicate the bounds for the described historical periods in parentheses. It can be seen from the table that the approaches of the present section and [15] (Part 1, Ch. 2, §4) mostly lead to qualitatively the same results, which makes us hope that my initial hypotheses regarding the representability of information about the splashes of the volume functions for historical texts is correct.
2. The Maximum Correlation Principle and Its Verification by Frequency Histograms. Method for the Discovery of Dependent Historical Texts. The Period of "Confusion" in the History of Russia (1584-1600 A.D.)
As another example, we give the results of an analysis of a collection of sources dating from the end of the 16th and beginning of 17th cc. A.D., the period of "confusion" in the history of Russia. The investigation was performed by the author in 1981-1982. The large textual volumes and complexity of integer relations create enormous difficulties if we intend to study the texts traditionally. The 30 sources were separated into annual fragments, or "chapters", and then the volume of each portion in words was determined. The job was done by N. S. Kellin and L. E. Morozova at the author's request. The obtained data were systematized and tabulated, indicating the textual volumes for each year from 1584 to 1619, the period traditionally referred to as "confusion". Part of the table (from 1584 to 1598) is given in Table 2, marking off years on the horizontal axis and the numbers of the following basic historical texts along the vertical axis, viz.,
(1) Povest' o chestnom zhytii, (2) Povest' kako voschytiti, (3) Povest' kako otomstiti, (4) Zhytiye Dmitriya (T.), (5) Zhytiye Dmitriya (M.), (6) Skazaniye o Grishke, (7) Skazaniye o Fyodore, (8) Skazaniye o samozvantse, (9) Povest' Shakhovskogo, (10) Zhytiye Iova, (11) Skazaniye Avraamiya (1), (12) Skazaniye Avraamiya (2), (13) The 1617 Chronograph, (14) Vremennik Timofeeva, (15) Povest' Katyreva (1), (16) Povest' Katyreva (2), (17) Inoye skazaniye, (18) Piskarevskiy letopisets, and (19) Novyi letopisets.
The volume graph was constructed for each text, and years in which they exhibit splashes were indicated by 1 in Table 3. We also studied Izvet Varlaama, Bel'skiy letopisets and Skazaniye o Skopine.

All the 22 texts mostly describe the same events in one historical period; hence, they are dependent in the sence of the above definition, which is explicitly seen in Table 3 with expressed correlation between the local maxima of different texts. Almost all graphs show splashes simultaneously, viz., in 1584, 1587, 1591, 1598, and 1606. The textual dependence is also confirmed by formal computations. We have calculated the distance R(X, Y) (see §1) between each two texts X and Y from the indicated collection. Recall that we found the distance from each maximum of the graph of vol X(t) to the nearest one for vol Y(t), and summed up the obtained values for all the splashes. Obtaining a certain quantity r(X, Y), we interchanged X and Y, and repeated the procedure in order to find r(Y, X). We took the sum of r(X, Y) and r(Y, X) as R(X, Y). It is clear that, generally speaking, r(X, Y) and r(Y, X) are different. In principle, we can construct two square matrices made up of r(X, Y) and
R(X, Y). In general, they differ in the non-symmetry of llr(X, Y)II and symmetry
of IIR(X, Y)II obtained by symmetrizing llr(X, Y)II- To estimate how dependent Texts 1-22 are, we constructed the frequency histogram for R(X, Y), for which we marked off the integers 0,1,2,3, ... on the horizontal. Recall that the "distance" R(X, Y) assumes integral values, since we measured the distance between the points of the splashes in years. We then determined how many times zero distance was
entered into the integral matrix IIR(X, Y)II- The obtained value was marked on the vertical line passing through the point O on the horizontal axis. We also saw how
many times unity was recorded in IIR(X, Y)II- We marked the obtained value on the vertical line passing through the point 1, etc., and derived a certain frequency
histogram. If there were many small R(X, Y) in the distance matrix IIR(X, Y)II,



Verification by Frequency Histograms 5
then the histogram maximum was shifted to the left, closer to the origin. It occurred in the case of dependent texts. The more dependent they were, the greater was the maximum shifted to the origin, i.e., to the left. The less dependent they were, the more to the right was the histogram maximum (Fig. 35).

Thus, the direction of the shift of the histogram maximum indicates whether or not the investigated texts are dependent, and how strong the dependence is. The method was applied by the author to analyze the above textual group, and the result is shown in Fig. 36. It is seen explicitly that almost all of the histogram and its basic maximum are shifted to the left, which means that practically the whole of the square matrix
IIR(X, Y)II of order 22x22 consists of small numbers, i.e., almost all the distances between X and Y are small. We also constructed the histogram for the case of independent texts for the purpose of comparison, for which we took the following chronicles:
A-Russian Primary Chronicle (850-1110 A.O.), B-Akademicheskaya letopis' (1336-1446 A.O.), and C-Nikiforovskaya letopis' (850-1430 A.O.). They were compared with the above 22 texts. We constructed the volume graphs, indicated the splash-points, and calculated all the distances R(X, Y), where X

Figure 35. Histograms for dependent and independent texts Figs 1-34 appear in Vol. I of this work
ranged over three texts A, B, and C, while Y ranged over 22 texts of the "confusion" period. We obtained a rectangular matrix IIR(X, Y)II of order 3x22. The corresponding frequency histogram is shown in Fig. 37.
A qualitatively different character of the graph is explicit, viz., almost the whole is shifted to the right. It is not surprising, since the texts A, B, and C describing the events of the 9-15th cc. A.O. are independent of Texts 1-22 of the "confusion" period. The performed experiment thereby confirmed again the validity of the maximum correlation principle. The volume graphs for dependent texts turned out to make splashes almost simultaneously, whereas the graphs for independent texts exhibited splashes in different years. Note that the explicit dependence of the "confusion" period does not at all mean that the contents is identical. In point of fact, each text possesses its own characteristics and casts light on some events, while omitting the others, accentuating them differently, etc. Nevertheless (and this is important!), the graphs for the different chroniclers turn out to "exhibit splashes" practically simultaneously in spite of their individualities. Without suspecting that themselves, they thereby realize the maximum correlation principle in practice, proceeding from approximately the same surviving information stock. We stress that the origin of the primary information stock is subject to other and more complicated laws than those discovered above. It is possible that some insignificant event was described in many a text, whereas a substantially more important event was reflected only in one of them or not described at all.

Thus, to investigate the dependence or independence of a text group, we can
also do as follows. Consider two groups of texts (X) = (X1, ... , Xk) and (Y) = (Y1 , ... , Yp) describing two time intervals of the same length. The question arises whether they are dependent. To find the answer, we should construct all volume graphs, e.g., annually, and superimpose the described intervals. We mark all the



8 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
splash points for the volume graphs, and calculate the "distance" between each pair of texts. The obtained values are naturally organized into a square matrix of order
(k + p) x (k + p), viz.,
IIR(X;, Ya)ll 11
IIR(Y;, Y;) II
It contains sufficiently complete information to make a hypothesis regarding textual dependence or independence. The dependence between the texts of the first
group (X) = (X1 , ... ,Xk) and that inside the second group (Y) = (Y1, ... ,Yp)
reveal themselves by the smallness (almost zero) of all entries in II R(X;, Xj) II,
whereas that between the texts of (X) and (Y) by at least one of IIR(X;, Ya) II
and IIR(Ya, X;) II consisting of small numbers, i.e., "being close to zero". Thus, we can generally construct four frequency histograms for each of
For example, let them be of the form shown in Fig. 38, which means that the texts
X1 , ... , Xk are independent of each other, Y1 , ... , Yp are also independent, whereas
(X) = (X1, ... , Xk) is dependent on (Y) = (Y1, ... ,Yp). The method efficiency was demonstrated by us above with the example of "confusion" period texts. Note that our method permits us to process extremely large samples of information, which is especially important in discovering intrinsic dependences, and that we discovered all the earlier-known dependences between certain of the above-listed "confusion" texts, revealed by the classical methods for primary source analysis. Besides, we also obtained certain new results, e.g., "Povest' o chestnom zhytii tsarya Fyodora Ivanovicha" reveals an interesting dependence on the other texts of the "confusion" period. The suggested method also permits us to solve some other problems, e.g., it may happen that the large matrix IIR((X), (Y))II is "strongly asymmetric", i.e., for
example, the elements of IIR(X;, Ya) II are much greater than those of IIR(Ya, X;) II, which may indicate the "dependence direction". The texts of the group (X) are then dependent on those in the group (Y), but not vice versa, which can point to the fact that those from (Y) served as primary sources for (X). In other words, the texts of (Y) became the components of later texts from (X). Meanwhile, all (or almost all) local maxima of the texts in (Y) were preserved, and new local maxima of the texts in (X) were added. Thus, we see that our method permits us, at least in principle, to foresee the "dependence direction", i.e., roughly speaking, "who copied whom".

3. A Method for Dating Historical Events Described in Chronographic Texts, and Its Verification Against Reliable Historical Data
9
The obtained statement of the maximum correlation principle permits us to offer a new method for dating ancient events described in texts of chronographic nature. Let Y be a historical text satisfying the above constraints, and describing unknown events whose absolute dating was lost. Let years t be counted from some date of local importance, viz., the foundation of a city, coronation of a king, etc. How can we restore the absolute dates of the described events? Count the "chapter" volume graph {function) or other above-mentioned graphs based on partitioning a text into fragments each of which describes its own year. Compare the obtained volume graph with those for other texts whose absolute dating is already known as reliable. If we discover a text X for which d(X, Y) (see [15] and Part 1, §4) is small, i.e., of the same order as for dependent texts (e.g., not exceeding 10-s for the above number of maxima), then we can conclude with sufficiently large probability, it being the greater the smaller d(X, Y) is, that the events described in these two texts are possibly coincident or close. In other words, we should consider and analyze



10 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
the hypothesis about their possible dependence. Certainly, the method is not at all universal, and possesses sufficiently narrow application area. Therefore, some conclusive results or other can be deduced only by involving other dating methods. Meanwhile, two texts which are possibly dependent may be outwardly different: e.g., two versions of the same chronicle written in different countries, etc. It is important that we date a text on the basis of the study of its quantitative characteristics, and not its contents, which can be subjectively tinged. The described method was checked against medieval and texts already dated. The obtained results led to the same datings. We illustrate by two simple examples demonstrating the efficiency of the method.
Example 1. Let Y = Dvinskoy letopisets (shorter version) describing the events in a 327-year interval [248]. Let us attempt to date these events with the use of the described method, i.e., proceeding only from the analysis of its quantitative characteristics, and not involving the contents. Going through the list of the Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles, we discover a text X whose volume graph exhibits splashes practically in the same years as that of Y. It turns out that
d(X, Y) = 2 x 10- 25 . Therefore, we can conjecture that the texts are dependent, and, probably, describe the same epoch and region. In particular, we have dated the events described in Y. The text X discovered by us is a lengthy version of the Dvinskaya Chronicle (Dvinskoy letopisets) describing 1390-1717 A.D. The dating of Y obtained by us coincided with its standard one, which confirms the efficiency of the method. Certainly, the answer was quite obvious in this elementary example, because we possess both versions of the Dvinskaya Chronicle (the shorter and complete one). However, we have demonstrated the possibility of dating an unknown text only on the basis of analysis of its formal quantitative characteristics. This method does not call for the investigation of the contents. On the one hand, this sharply narrows the area of application. On the other hand, the method permits us to substantially simplify many operations requiring the processing of large information samples. In particular, the method is applicable to texts written in a unintelligible language, e.g., texts which contain a large number of undecipherable abbreviations, notations, etc.
Example 2. Let Y =Akademicheskaya letopis' [248]. Following the above procedure, we attempt to date the described events. Going through the Chronicles, and finding
the volume functions, we discover the text X = part of the Suprasl'skaya letopis' (see above) describing 1336-1374 A.D., whose volume graph shows splashes in the
same years as that ofY. We find that d(X, Y) = 10- 14 _ We thereby date the events
in Y with respect to the texts already dated. The dating obtained by us coincides with that usually given, and is generally known. In 1980, I studied several dozen examples of the same kind, confirming the efficiency of the method in all the cases: The obtained datings coincided with those known earlier. The suggested method is not at all universal. The most stable results are obtained for texts of large volume, describing sufficiently large time intervals, several decades or centuries long. The method's application to "short" texts should be done accurately.

4. Methods for Ordering and Dating Old Geographic Maps and Descriptions
4.1. The map-code and the map-improvement principle
11
Each geographic map described in a historical text graphically or verbally reflects the state of geography in the epoch when it was made. With the development of science, cartography developed, too, and erroneous information, generally speaking, decreased, while the amount of correct information increased. It would be interesting to work out a formal method of statistical character, permitting us to date one or another geographic description and map, and, in particular, find a chronologically correct relative ordering in time of the collection of surviving maps on the basis of the analysis of configurational and terminological particulars. In the present section, we offer such a technique, list the results of the associated experiment permitting us to check the algorithm, and apply it for the purpose of dating. Since considerable geographic data have been accumulated until now, its systematic study requires some global approach which can be based on the statistical "map-improvement principle" formulated below, verified and confirmed by dated sources. Such an approach permits us to process considerable cartographic information, and discover statistical regularities characterizing the evolution of geographic ideas. It should be noted that a considerable number of works have appeared recently that are devoted to the analysis of cartographic features of old maps [249], [270], [271], [272].
Since we had to study a considerable number of geographic data, quite heterogeneous and fixed in ancient maps, we had to create a table, called by the author the map-code (MC), that accumulates all the basic features of concrete map. The list of the basic features was made up according to their importance, "invariance", and frequency of use by cartographers. This optimal map-code compiled on the basis of the concrete ancient map study permits us to represent each map given graphically or verbally as a table containing all basic map features in the order of decreasing "invariance". The MC was constructed in accordance with the same principle as the enquete-code (EC), introduced and studied by the author in Part l. We only give here its basic divisions: Whether it is (1) a terrestrial globe; (2) a plane map; (3) the map of the world; (4) a regional map; whether it depicts (5) the structure of the "map boundary" (water, land, etc.) in the case of the map of the world, position of the poles, equator, tropics, climatic zones and time zones; (6) map orientation, i.e., the use of the names "North", "South", etc., terms "above" or "below", Cybele (see [270], pp. 32-33), cartographic or chorographic orientation; whether it supplies (7) a complete list of all geographic names translated: continents, oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, states and individual regions, peoples and tribes, so-called "blank spaces"; (8) principal topological (geometric) characteristics of water reservoirs: bays and seas joined by them, representation of seas as large water reservoirs or narrow "rivers", the latter method being characteristic of many old maps, which can be explained by coastal navigation); (9) topological characteristics of the Mediterranean as the sea represented most often and accurately.
Thus, filling in all the items, we can represent each map as a set of characteristics, each of which can be considered as a "formal name" describing the properties of the



12 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
map. Meanwhile, Item 7 (list of the map names) is especially important, because it indicates whether the map belongs to a particular cartographic tradition first of all. The geometric characteristics (configurations of water reservoirs, rivers, etc.) are more complicated for formalization; hence, in a rough "sorting-out", the maps were only classified in accordance with Items 1-7. Note that the geographical size of the region described in one item of the MC should not be too large if we employ Items 8 and 9 to compare MCs in order to eliminate a possible influence of various projections also used today in making plane maps. If desired, we can introduce additional and more differentiated characteristics into the MC structure; however, we should always fulfil the condition that this list of characteristics must be included in each map from the collection under investigation, i.e., it must be indicated for each of them whether a particular feature is present. Consider some set of concrete maps, enumerate them arbitrarily, and order them as M(l), M(2), ... , M(H). The map is denoted by M(T), where the number T varies from 1 to H. The question arises: How does one find a chronologically correct order, in time, so that their sequence may correspond to their real datings and coincide with the order in which they were made? To solve the problem without resorting to some side information (which is often unavailable), and only making use of the data fixed in the maps themselves, we shall do as follows: For each map M(T), we fill its table MC (T) and make up the list of the basic features, indicating whether they are present or not. We introduce the concept of correct and incorrect feature. We call a feature correct if it corresponds to geographic reality, and incorrect otherwise. For example, the absence of a strait between the Black and the Mediterranean Sea should be regarded as an incorrect feature. We now formulate the map-improvement principle describing the chronologically correct ordering of maps with respect to the time they were made: (1) in passing from one map to another map, the incorrect features not corresponding to real geography vanish and do not appear on subsequent maps any longer ("errors are not repeated"), and (2) a correct feature which has appeared (e.g., a bay or river) is fixed and retained on all the subsequent maps.
This principle is natural, because it is based on the fact that the maps were always made mostly for the purpose of practice, seafaring, military expeditions, trade, etc. Therefore, it was important for map owners in each epoch that their maps should reflect reality more precisely. Under these conditions, the appearance of a correct feature had to be immediately fixed and retained; on the contrary, if some feature turned out to be incorrect, it was immediately removed and not retained any more. In spite of its obvious nature, the principle needs verification. Note that it is not a consequence of other principles formulated by the author in [15]-[25]. To check, it is convenient to formalize the whole procedure as follows. Fix a map M(To) numbered To, and find the value L(To, To) equal to the number offeatures first appearing there, both correct and incorrect, and absent on all the earlier maps (as they are ordered now). We then calculate L(To, T) showing how many of them were preserved on M(T), where T is greater than To. We can thereby construct the graph of L(T0 , T) for each M(To). The map-improvement principle can now be re-stated as follows: A sequence of maps is ordered chronologically correctly if and only if each graph of L(To, T) is of the form shown in Fig. 39, i.e., vanishes to the left of T0 , attains an absolute maximum



Methods for Ordering and Dating 13
Figure 39. The map-improvement principle
at To, and falls monotonically to the right. This picture is precisely equivalent to the above formulation, viz., appearing on a map, each correct feature does not vanish, whereas each incorrect one vanishes sooner or later if we discover that it does not correspond to reality (see Fig. 40).

Figure 40. Evolution of correct and incorrect features for geographic maps
The collection of the graphs of L(T0 , T) can be conveniently organized into a square matrix L{T} (see Fig. 41) if T0 is the number of the rows, and T of the columns.
In the case of the maps ordered chronologically correctly, L{T} should be of the following form, viz., the absolute maxima of each row are on the principal diagonal, the graph decreasing monotonically along each row and column. That the L(T0 , T) decrease with respect to the columns (as the numbers To decrease) means that each map fixes the fewer incorrect features the more ancient they are.
Certainly, in the real situation, L{T} can be remote from the theoretical matrix



14 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
Figure 41. The square matrix L{T}
for concrete maps, i.e., the graphs of L(T0 , T) can have only the approximate form shown in Fig. 39. However, if the maps were ordered chronologically incorrectly, the graphs of L(To, T) deviate still more from the ideal in Fig. 39. To estimate quantitatively the closeness of L{T} to the theoretical, it is convenient to make use of the averaged graph of Laver(T) by averaging the elements in the diagonals parallel to the principal axis. (See Fig. 42.)

4.2. Confirmation of the map-improvement principle
After the described formalization, we can experimentally verify the map-improvement principle. We use concrete medieval and modern maps whose ordering is free of doubt. Here, we indicate the most interesting of them: (1) the map of the world by Cosmas lndicopleustes, 6th c. A.D. (see [13], V. 1, p. 20, Fig. 11); (2) plane map by Cosmas Indicopleustes, 6th c. A.D. (ibid.); (3) arabic map by al-Istakhr1950 A.D. (ibid. V. 3, p. 221, Fig. 45); (4) map by Macrobius of the 10-15th cc. A.D. ([249], p. 85, Fig. 9); (5) map of the 11th c. in the Cottonian collection from the British Museum (ibid. V. 3, p. 223, Fig. 47); (6) map of the 12th c. A.D. from the Turin Library ([13] V. 2, p. 300, Fig. 111); (7) several European maps of the 14th c. in the History Museum, Moscow; (8) map from the 15th-c. book Opus sphericum by Sacra Bosco; (9) map of the world of 1470, the so-called Rad Karte ([273], p. 13); (10) a map of the world by Stefano Borgia of the 15th c. ([13], V. 2, p. 633, Fig. 162); (11) 6th-c. plane map of the world, representing the terrestrial globe, by Johannes Stabius (Stabius-Diirer-Karte, 1515) ([273], p. 15); (12) map of the 16th-c. book Miindialis Sphere Opusculiim by Sacra Bosco of 1519; (13) map by T. Occupario of 1522 (from the History Museum, Moscow); (14) map of the world by Diego Ribeiro of 1527, ([273], p. 14); (15) map of Cornelius Niccolai of 1598 (from the History Museum, Moscow); (16) terrestrial globe of the 17th c. (from the History Museum, Moscow); and (17) several modern maps.
The map-improvement principle was absolutely verified against this, not very considerable, data, and the averaged graph of Laver(T) practically coincided with the theoretical one in Figs. 39 and 42. In particular, it means that the above relative order of medieval maps was generally chronologically correct.
Hence, a method follows for finding a chronologically correct order of a collection of maps whose datings are unknown or doubtful, for which we first enumerate the maps under investigation in an arbitrary order, and construct the associated matrix L{T}, i.e., all the graphs of L(To, T). We then start mixing up the maps, i.e., change their relative order by means of all possible permutations u, each time computing the matrix L{uT} associated with the permutations, and strive for reducing the matrix to the ideal and theoretical form (see Figs. 39 and 42). This ordering of the maps for which the matrix is closest to the theoretical, and the graph of Laver(T) is monotonically decreasing, should be taken as chronologically correct and required. The fact that the map-improvement principle was confirmed permits us also to offer a method for dating old maps. Let A be a certain map whose dating is unknown. Construct its map-code, and subjoin it to the map-code collection of the maps already dated. Construct the graphs of L(T0 , T) and the matrix L{T} for all the maps of the collection, and assign A its number T0 • In accordance with the above procedure, we find the chronologically correct order for the whole collection. In particular, we find a place for A, which permits us to date the map with respect to the other dated maps. The method was applied to the following series of old maps: (1) the well-known map from the Geography of Ptolemy (edition of 1545; see [249], p. 97, Fig. 11), traditionally related to the lst-2nd cc. A.D. fell into the 15th-16th cc. A.D., near maps 8-15 from the above list; (2) the famous Tabula pentingeriana ([13], V. 3, pp. 232-233, Fig. 48), traditionally related to the time of Augustus Octavian fell



16 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
into the 11-12th cc. A.D.; (3) a series of ancient maps, though being later graphic reconstructions from the verbal description in old texts (see [249]): by Hesiod, traditionally dating from the 6th c. B.C. (ibid., p. 38, Fig. 1); Hecataeus, traditionally dating from the 6-5th cc. B.C. (ibid., p. 39, Fig. 1); Herodotus, traditionally dating from the 5th c. B.C. (ibid., p. 44, Fig. 2); Democritus, traditionally dating from 5-4th cc. B.C. (ibid., p. 45, Fig. 2); Eratosthenes, traditionally dating from 276-194 B.C. (ibid., pp. 68-71, Fig. 6); globe by Crates, traditionally dating from 168-165 B.C. (ibid., p. 77, Fig. 7) all fell into the 9-15th cc. A.D. when dated by means of the graphs of L(To, T) (see above) with respect to the indicated scale of Maps 1-17, and all after Cosmas lndicopleustes. Each of the maps was completed by its list of geographic names (see the definition of the MC). For example, Herodotus' map was extended with the data gathered from a map in [67*]. It should be noted that the traditional datings of the indicated old maps are outside the 6-18th cc. A.D. embraced by Maps 1-17. The performed experiment showed that the complete collection of all these maps, including Nos. 1-17, if we retain the traditional datings, did not satisfy the map-improvement principle; we, therefore, preferred Maps 1-17 as established sufficiently stably in chronological respect. An argument for the use of such an approach is that the rejection of the traditional dates permitted us to discover a new the map ordering which is well consistent with the graphs in Figs. 39 and 42.
4.3. Herodotus' map
The above confirmation of the map-improvement principle means that if the maps are ordered chronologically correctly, their quality improves as the ordinal number increases. The maps characterized by approximately the same features and quality turned out to be placed close to each other; the younger the map, the closer it is to the modern one graphically. The beginning of the scale contains the maps distorted most of all, and the exact contemporary ones are at the end. The map quality becomes satisfactory only from the end of 16th to the beginning of the 17th cc. A.D. One of the seas described by Herodotus was indentified by the historians as the Black Sea; however, it turned out that the figures given by Herodotus are not at all consistent with the data about the size of the Black Sea, known from ancient geographies (see the Russian edition of the Histories, [67*], p. 521). One of Herodotus' seas was identified with the Caspian Sea; it then turns out, that in the opinion of Herodotus, the Caucasus borders on this "Caspian" Sea in the West ([67], [67*], Bk. 1, Nos. 203-204). It can mean that Herodotus' map was turned upside down, with North placed at the bottom, and South at the top. But then such a position of the map superimposes Assyria on Europe (Germany) and, in particular, Babylon on Rome. This change of map orientation (at least, in certain parts of the Histories) does not contradict the other geographic data given by Herodotus. According to him, the Persians lived in Asia up to the Southern Sea said to be the Red Sea ([67], Bk. 4, No. 37). According to the modern version, the Persians must have lived in Asia up to the Southern Sea called today the Persian Gulf. The farther the worse. Describing the peninsula (regarded by today's historians as Arabia), Herodotus writes that it starts with the Persian land and extends to



Methods for Ordering and Dating 17
the Red Sea (ibid., Bk. 4, No. 39). Sounding true, this contradicts the historians' assertions that Herodotus' Red Sea is, actually, the Persian Gulf (ibid.) Therefore, the commentator "corrects" Herodotus: "Here, the Red Sea is the Persian Gulf' (see the Russian edition of the Histories, [67*], App. Bk. 4, Comm. 34). Further, the Red Sea, as we understand it today, may extend above the Persian-occupied land according to Herodotus, Bk. 40, under No. 40, under only one condition, viz., if the map is turned upside down with respect to the modern one. Saving the traditional localizations, the historians are, therefore, forced to identify here the Red Sea with the Persian Gulf ([67*], App., Bk. 4, Comm. 36). However, this is not a way out, because the Persian Gulf is situated lower (or east) than the area inhabited by the Persians, but not at all above it. Herodotus made much trouble for the historians with his "Red Sea". It had to be identified with the whole of the Indian Ocean when it was mentioned in Bk. 2, No. 102. (ibid., App. Bk. 2, Comm. 110). And East and West were interchanged again. Herodotus identified the Red Sea with the Southern Sea in Bk. 4. No. 37, which embarrasses the historians still more when they attempt to adjust Herodotus to the framework of traditional localizations. They are now forced to identify the Red (i.e., Southern) Sea with the Black Sea! ([67*], App., Bk. 1, Comm. 12). And again the East and West are interchanged with respect to the "Persians". After the relocalizations of the type, Red Sea= Southern Sea= Black Sea= Northern Sea= Mediterranean Sea= Persian Gulf= Our Sea = Indian Ocean, any talk about Herodotus' data confirming the traditional locatizations is taken as inaccurate. The study of other examples, which we omit here, demonstrates the possibility of the following overlappings, viz., Assyria = Germany, Babylonia= Rome, Persia= Gaul (France?), Media= Hungary. The repeated mentions by Herodotus of the Crestonaei are taken as extremely strange. According to Herodotus, there exists an entire region called Crestonia and a city Creston. The Crestonaei originated from the other countries in Greece ([67*], pp. 27, 239, 240, 524). Herodotus also uses the term Crossaea ([67*], pp. 345, 408, 344). These numerous indications are unwillingly associated with the "Crusaders" ( "cross" is also a "Crusade" term) flooding Greece in the 12-13th cc. A.D. Comparison of the Crestonaei with the Crusaders is also natural because certain ancient authors called the Christians "Chrestians". Even Tacitus wrote Chrestianos instead of Christianos in the original of his manuscript of the Annals (15, 44; irrespective of the fact whether or not they were forged; see the study of Anderson). Note that the modern commentators do not discuss Herodotus' numerous "Crusade" terms, though the other tribes, peoples and cities were given extensive commentary. Moreover, the most detailed map of the world according to Herodotus was included in the edition [67*]. It was made by historians in 1964 (see the Russian edition of Herodotus and "Das Geschichtswerk des Herodotos von Halikarnassos". Berlin, 1964.). Even small towns and villages mentioned in the Histories were marked. Neither the Crestonaei nor Creston nor Crossaea are mapped(?!).
4.4. Medieval geography
In general, geographical knowledge in 16th-c. Europe was very far from modern, e.g., T. Occupario's map of 1522 (Moscow History Museum) represented Europe



18 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
and Asia in proportions sharply different from the modern ones. Greenland turns out to be a European peninsula, Scandinavia is drawn into a thin strip, the Bosphorus and Dardanelles are much extended and enlarged, the Black Sea is turned askew, and the Caspian Sea elongated horizontally and made literally unrecognizable. The only region reflected more or less faithfully is the Mediterranean (where seafaring was developed most), but then Greece was represented as a triangle without the Peloponnese. Ethnographic evidence was still farther from that fixed by traditional history of the time. For example, Dacia is placed in Scandinavia, Albania on the Caspian Sea, Gottia (the Goths' land?) again in Scandinavia, China is completely absent, Judei clausi can be seen in north of Siberia, etc. By the way, France is called Gallia, the Don by its ancient name Tanais, and Russia and Moscovia are separated, the latter being placed far north, near the Arctic Ocean. Cornelius Niccolai's map of 1598 is also rich in similar distortions, but now to a lesser degree. During this century, geographical knowledge accumulated very rapidly. For example, the terrestrial globe of the 17th c. in the Moscow History Museum already reflects reality quite well. We now point to the possibility, in principle, of substantially different, in the geographic and ethnic sense, introduction of vowels into ancient texts. Having studied the biblical (vowel-free) mentions of ASR, N. A. Morozov supplies them with the translation "leader" or "Fiihrer", and relates the term to Germany, whose geographic position is well consistent with that of Assyria (the canonical translation of Ashur), given in the Bible with respect to the other geographic locations if we make Jerusalem coincident with Rome or Pompeii. The data permitting us to understand Rome in Italy by the term "guardian city" (Samaria) are given in [13], V. 2. We then cannot help stressing the passage:
"... and Remaliah's son (in N. A. Morozov's translation, Romulus the ThundererA. F.) the chief of Samaria (probably, the city's founder-A. F.)" (Is 7:9).
It is written just in this way "RML-IEU", i.e., Romulus the Thunderer, but it was Romulus who had founded Rome! A still stranger impression is made by the study of biblical vowel-free names of countries and peoples. For example, according to N. A. Morozov,
"Tu-HERM implies a German not only due to the consonance with the primary name of his country Die Germa, but also because the sound T is often affixed to Jewish words when they become nominatives" ([13], V. 2, pp. 613-614).
N. A. Morozov extensively analyzed the ancient text, and asserted that almost all of the largest peoples of medieval Europe and the Mediterranean had been mentioned in the Bible, and almost always just where they are located today. The traditional localizations of the biblical lands of Asia Minor are then questioned, the example being old Phoenicia and its cities Tyre and Sidon. Due to the above possibility of the European locations of many a biblical event and term, it should be noted that the word Venetia could have been read by the ancients both as Venice in its Roman version and Phoinike (or Phoenicia) in the German version, reading v as "fau" and
the assimilation "C" ="K", as might be seen in the words "caesar" ="kaesar" (note by T. N. Fomenko). This simple observation does not contradict the other biblical data regarding Phoenicia and, moreover, is confirmed by them. It is traditionally believed that Phoenicia was a powerful sea state reigning over the whole of the Mediterranean,

founding its colonies in Sicily, Spain, Africa, etc., trading widely with remote lands in articles confirming its power (see, e.g., Ez. 27). The powerful medieval republic of Venice does, in fact, satisfy all these data. On the other hand, traditional history states that the main Phoenician cities were modern Tyre and Sidon (Saida). Here are official sailing directions of the 19th c. [96], describing Saida with 1600 people in 1818. "There is a small harbour South of it. The jetty barely noticeable today was earlier a small port, now completely covered by sands. Plague sometimes rages here. Saida exhibits no remembrances of its earlier magnificence. A reef comes out of the southern shore, and it is shallow near the northern shore. The depth is insufficient between the town and island, the pass narrow and stony. You cannot gather water here, because a large sloop cannot approach the shore" ([96], cited by [13], V. 2. p. 637).
In the 19th c., this small town was at the mouth of a river, and existed mainly from its gardens. The strategic position was hopeless. During the Crusades, it passed from one rule to another many times, and had never existed as a large independent medieval trading centre ([13], V. 2). All the above-said is in striking contrast with the reports about great Sidon and Phoenicia. The situation with Tyre is still more discouraging:
The earlier town vanished without leaving a trace. The newer one is situated on a stony island joined to the mainland by an isthmus. The principal trading articles are tobacco, coal, dried figs, wood. The markets are scarce. The port admits only small boats ([13], pp. 640-641). All of this is again sharply different from the biblical legends about "great Tyre". Its flotillas (!) went as far as the Atlantic, traded in fabrics of different make, ebony, luxury goods, indigo, glass and hardware, etc. The Bible devotes many of its pages to the description of the literally grandiose trade by Tyre (Ez. 27:1-24).
Studying the spelling of Tyre in the ancient original, N. A. Morozov conjectured that, in fact, Tyre might mean "Caesar" city (Constantinople). Constantinople indeed was a large medieval seaport of the power supported by the Venetian and Genoese fleets.
5. Frequency Distributions in Rulers' Numerical Dynasties
5.1. Parallel rulers' dynasties
In this section, we give the list of rulers and the duration of their rules, possessing small coefficients .\(a, b).See Part 1, §5 for the definition of .\(a, b). The above algorithm acts as follows if we compare two authentic dynastic streams (i.e., sequences of all rulers in the region). We select a dynastic jet, i.e., a subsequence of rulers whose sum completely covers the whole time interval embraced by the dynasty. Since the authentic dynastic streams contain many co-rulers, we can select, generally speaking, several different jets, or numerical dynasties, from each stream. Besides, we fix all possible versions of the start and end of each reign. We recall once again that these dates are determined differently by different chroniclers; therefore,



20 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
all these divergences were naturally taken into account in the choice of jets. This fact also increases the number of possible jets distinguished for a chosen dynasty. It may turn out in comparing two dynasties that only two jets are dependent in the set of all possible pairs of them, whereas the others are independent. It is important that the rule durations are considered only approximately, since the error function / (a;) was introduced into the algorithm. In other words, if a rule duration a; is less than 20 years, then the difference a; - b; is considered by us only to the accuracy of ±2 years. If a; varies from 20 to 30, then to the accuracy of ±3 years. However, if a; is greater than 30 years, then the admissible error may attain ±10 years, and then increase linearly with the growth of [a;/10] ([] meaning the integer part of the real number). Hence, it suffices to know only very approximate values of rule durations, and not the exact ones, which are unknown in many cases. It turns out that the nature of the rule-duration graph is important (i.e., the form of the broken curve). Thus, both the algorithm and the results obtained on its basis are extremely stable with respect to perturbations of the rule durations within the indicated limits. The application of the method to historical data traditionally believed to belong to before the 13th c. A.D. unexpectedly led to the discovery of dynastic pairs (jets) a and b, regarded as independent in all respects, but for which the proximity coefficient .X(a, b) is of the same order as for necessarily dependent dynasties, i.e., does not exceed 10-8 . Below, we give Tables 4-18 indicating (relative to dating traditionally) the rulers from the most interesting special dynastic pairs discovered, for which .X(a, b) < 10-8 (Figs. 43-64). It means that they are probably dependent, and are duplicates or parallels. We compare the rule-duration graphs for the rulers enumerated consecutively, and also consider the overlapping of two dynasties on the time axis after a rigid shift of one of them until it coincides with the other. The mutual dispositions in time of individual rulers are nevertheless retained (under such rigid shift). For better visuality, we join the starting points and ends of the overlapping rulers by vertical lines. We illustrate this with further important examples. Calculating the average shift, we have compared the rule ends. That all these overlapping dynasties in Tables 4-18 (Figs. 43-64) are parallel is perfectly consistent with the decomposition of the Global Chronological Diagram (GCD) (Fig. 65), i.e., the modern ancient and medieval history "textbook" (see its definition and description in the Part 1), into the sum of four identical chronicles. Its description in Table 19 (Figs. 66(1), 66(2), 66(3), 67) is more detailed than in [24], Fig. 3. The line E (left column) schematically represents the ancient and medieval history of Europe, the Mediterranean and Near East with respect to traditional dating, whereas B gives the biblical chronology and history described in the Old and New Testaments. This history is represented with an upward shift by c. 1,800 years in accordance with its overlapping of the events of European history, discovered by the author. The letters K, T, II, P, C, H in the GCD, Figs. 65, 66, Table 19, represent different historical epochs or periods. For brevity, we re-designated the epochs denoted ibid. by black triangles and the letters MT simply by T. The line Co in Table 19 is the original, i.e., the chronicle that probably describes the authentic history of the above regions and their authentic chronology (see the first line at the bottom of Figs. 65, 66). Line C1 (third line from the bottom in Fig. 65) represents the distorted original Co

to which several duplicates have already been added, whereas C2, C3, and C4 in Table 19 (fourth, fifth and sixth lines from the bottom in Fig. 65), are the duplicatescopies of the line C1 driven backwards through 333, 1,053, and 1,778 years, respectively. Thus, Table 19 contains events indexed identically by numbers or letters, and placed on the same horizontal axis, i.e., duplicates identifiable completely or partly on the basis of new dating methods. Moreover, those indexed by several letters in the first and second columns are the sums (overlappings) of events on the same horizontal axis in the remaining table columns with the same number. For example, for Event 16: Event P /C in the 1st column of the Table 19 is obtained by (overlapping) summing Event 16: Event C from the line C2, and Event 16: Event P from C1. Table 18 contains the duplicates discovered by my enquete-code method (15], (21] (Part 1). The personages in one column are duplicates, as well as the events listed in the first, their originals being, probably, those in 13th-c. Italy. Table 17 is devoted to the description of the discovered parallel between the events in medieval and ancient Greece. Their coincidence occurs when shifting the ancient events rigidly upwards by c. 1,800 years. This table is also completely consistent with the GCD decomposition into the sum of four identical chronicles C1 , C2, C3, and C4.
In the tables, we indicate the rule periods, and the duration in parentheses (e.g., Arcadius 395-408(13)). We also give certain enquete-code fragments to give an idea of the parallels of events. The complete enquete-code tables are extremely large and are omitted here. For the reader's convenience, the bibliographic references are indicated in the tables and some diagrams.

According to [39], the kingdom of Israel started in 922 B.C. Since the zeroth year
of the kingdom of Israel in the table was 920 B.C., the shift is c. 920 + 922 = 1842 years, which is close to the third basic shift by 1,778 (or 1,800) years on the GCD (Part 1). This is one of the basic parallels.

Frequency Distributions
Chronicle C3 on GCD, years A.D. 1,053-year backward shift. The 1,000-year shift is due to writing some dates as follows: For example, 1st c. since Christ= X.I c. Letter X was originally abbreviation of name (which was forgotten afterwards), and 11th c. obtained upon formally decoding "X.1 c." Similarly, "l00th year since Jesus = I. 100th year"= 1100 year, because letter I also means one thousand. Eventually, dates were shifted by 1,000 years

Figure 65. The Global Chronological Diagram and the three main chronological shifts. General structure
The following supplement to the method on numerical dynasties and to the author's paper [18] was made by G. Nosovsky. The above (Part 1) distinction measure .X admits a simple probabilistic interpretation delineating the assumptions which were adopted in formalizing the problem. Consider the above (Part 1) parallelepiped II, check consecutively all elements of
the set V(D), and see whether they belong to the set II. Thus, we have IV(D)I tests.
If an element from V(D) belongs to II, then we regard the corresponding test as a success. The probability of a success in one test is estimated just by the number .X in accordance with the theorem known from mathematical statistics. We now assume that the probability of a success in one test is unaltered if we only take the elements from the set D (or, more exactly, the distribution of the random variable
if an element a belongs to II, if an element a does not belong to II (a E V(D))

Therefore, they must be somehow dependent.
The computation is fully consistent with the obtained results, viz., for indepen
dent numerical dynasties, we obtain A ;?:: 10-3 '.:::'. 1/IDI (i.e., the probability that they fall independently into the corresponding parallelepiped II is of the order of unity); whereas for dependent numerical dynasties, the value of A does not exceed 10-8 , i.e., the probability that they fall into the corresponding parallelepiped II indepen
dently is not greater than 10-5 • Thus, the probability of "random" identification of two independent numerical dynasties does not exceed 10-5 • The standard counterargument that "an event of infinitesimally small probability can occur in great many phenomena'' can be reciprocated by the computation of probability, proceeding from the complete number of tests. An event of an infinitesimally small probability can, in fact, "occur" in a great number of tests; however, we should not forget that the number of tests multiplied by the probability of the event in question in one test must be of the order of unity.
5.18. Possible explanation of the three chronological shifts discovered in the Global Chronological Diagram
1. The general idea and the 1,000-year shift. We now give one of possible explanations for the chronological shifts discovered in the GCD. For example, the 1,053-year (or c. 1,000-year) shift could have arisen from later juxtaposing two different techniques for writing dates, viz., the abbreviated form "Hird c. since Christ" could have been written as "X. III century", where X is the first letter of the word Christ (Gr. Xpurnx;), i.e., one of the most widely spread medieval anagrams of the name "Jesus" [44]. This is consistent with the overlapping of Gregory VII Hildebrand (11th c. A.D., born c. 1020, pope from 1073 until 1085; ibid.) and Jesus Christ in shifting downwards by 1,053 years (see the GCD, Fig. 66).
In particular, the 3rd c. since Christ (or Hildebrand) is the 3rd c. since the beginning of the 11th c. A.D., which just yields the 13th c. A.D., or X.111 century. This form of writing is well consistent with the Italian names of centuries, widely spread in the Middle Ages, viz., the 13th c. was called Trecento (the third hundred years), and the 14th c. Quattrocento (the fourth hundred years). Similarly, the year 1300 could have meant originally 1.300, i.e., the 300th year since Jesus (Gr. I11uovc;).
This way of writing is consistent with the preceding, since the year 1300 = 300th
year since Jesus = 300th year since the beginning of the 11th c. A.D. (from the birth of Hildebrand). In this connection, in our opinion, more attention should be paid to the fact that, in medieval documents, especially, of the 13-14th cc. A.D., the first letters (meaning, as assumed today, "large numbers") were separated by dots from the last letters denoting dates representing less than ten. For example, the year 1527 is written in this fashion in the Latin letters on the well-known map of the world by Diego Ribeiro. See "Diirer Kunst und Geometrie", E. Schroder, Berlin, 1980, p. 14.
Finally, another way, viz., a date in expanded form when the formula "since the



72 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
birth of Christ" was written verbally and completely, and not replaced by one letter; say, the "Hird century since the birth of Christ" instead of "X.HI century". With time, the information that the letters "X" and "I" at the beginning of the above formulas mean the first letters of the names Christ and Jesus was lost. The letters were ascribed their numerical values instead (figures having been earlier denoted by letters), viz., X = ten, I = unity, i.e., "X.HI" and "1.300" started to be naturally read as the "13th century" and "one thousand and three hundred years", which led to shifting "backwards" by 1,000 years the part of documents that made use of the spelled form of writing dates, e.g., "Hird c. since the birth of Christ" instead of the abbreviated (X.IH c.). In other words, the 1,000-year shift is the difference between the spelled form of writing dates and the abbreviated form. A similar mechanism could, in the author's opinion, have led to the appearance of various dates "since the creation of the world", e.g., the Byzantine date of 5508 B.C. Since earlier each letter of the alphabet was associated with a figure (A=l, etc.), numbers were denoted by letters in ancient documents. We now formulate a hypothesis, viz., that the original basic dates with which the count from a particular year started might have been written in literal abbreviations making up a meaningful short verbal formula such as in the above example. This "word-date" was an abbreviation of the expanded verbal formula describing an event which was a basis for one or another calendar. Denoting figures verbally, and counting years subsequently from the first "word-date", the figures were replaced by letters (1 by A, 2 by B, etc.), which led to a rapid distortion of the first "word-date", and all the subsequent ones became senseless from the standpoint of the language in which they were written. It is clear that the original meaning of the first "word-date" was soon forgotten. Thus, in a long range of the meaning of the word-dates, e.g., consecutive years from the creation of the world, we can attempt to find those rare original word-dates which not only possess a meaningful reading as an abbreviation of expanded verbal formulas, but also correspond to authentic events which form a basis for the given calendar. We illustrate this by the example of the above date 5508 B.C. We have already seen that the events related to Hildebrand in the 11th c. A.D. could serve as a reference point for counting years since the birth of the Christ, i.e., for the period "A.D." We distinguish two basic dates relating to Hildebrand, viz., 1073, his election as a pope [74], [44], and 1075, the year of Cencius' conspiracy against Gregory Hildebrand ([44], [44*] V.4, pp.155-156) and, at the same time, the year of a lunar eclipse related by the early Christian authors to the Crucifixion, which was traditionally believed to have occurred in the first half of the 1st c. A.D. Re-calculating these two dates in terms of those since the creation of the world according to Byzantine and Russian tradition, we obtain (6581 = 1073 + 5508), and (6583 = 1075+5508). Now, writing the figures as letters in accordance with the traditional rules (see [275], p.150), we obtain the word-dates 6581 =:/; S4>IIA, 6583 =:/;
S4>rrr. The sign " :/;" distinguishing word-dates from other words is regarded today only as the formal notation of "one thousand". However, we cannot exclude the possibility of its being a distorted form of writing the letter I (Jesus) in the original, (see also the above identification of the letter "I" with "1,000" in writing, e.g., the year 1.300). Further, the letter 4> was also written as 0 (see the old Russian texts). Taking into account these two remarks, we obtain the following word-dates,

viz., 6581 = IS0IIA, 6583 = IS01If. It is obvious that they can be considered as abbreviations of the following expanded formulas, viz., "Jesus God Pope Augustus" (here IS = Jesus, 0wv = God, II = pope, A = augustus) and "Jesus God Pope Gregory (or Hildebrand)", "f" meaning Gregory in the latter case.
Thus, both word-dates are perfectly meaningful and are related to the activity of Hildebrand and two central events in his "biography". We can now suggest the following hypothetical re-construction of how the date of 5508 B.C. might have arisen. The two above events could serve as basic reference points for counting years "since Pope Gregory" in certain documents, i.e., A.D. (see above). Writing the exhibited formulas expanded above in abbreviated form (or only the first of them), the chronicler meant their original meaning, and started counting years. Since the letter A means 1 (unity), the year count began with the natural figure, e.g., "since Jesus the God Pope's year One" = IS0IIA [275]. Subsequently, the letter B = 2 appared instead of A= 1, etc., and the word-date started varying, whereas the original word got distorted, and the sense of the initial abbreviation was soon forgotten. Subsequent word-dates were understood only as a set of letter-figures for writing dates.
The later chronologists substituted the corresponding figures for letters and obtained, e.g., the number 6581 for the word IS0IIA. Along with the documents making use of this way of writing dates, there existed others in which the same date, the year 1073, was written as I.073, i.e., the "73rd year since Jesus". For the later chronologists, the letter I already possessed the meaning of "1,000", and the whole date was read as "the year 1073". The question then arose regarding the comparison of these two calendars. Juxtaposing two different ways of writing the same date, i.e., IS0IIA = 6581 and I.073=1073, and substracting the second number from the first, the chronologist just obtained the value 5508 = 6581 - 1073. He thereby "recognized", or "computed", the date of the creation of the world in terms of the calendar "since the birth of Christ". It is obvious that the same result, 5508 B.C., could have been obtained by making use of the second date IS0Ilf = 6583, and subtracting 1.075, or 1075, from it. Moreover, the same result could have been derived
by comparing the two dates IS0IIA + T and I.073 + T, where T is any number of years that have passed since Gregory's election in 1073. In other words, to carry out the described computation, it is not at all necessary to base it upon the "original word-dates" from which counting the years had started.
It is probable that the other dates of the creation of the world were "computed"in the same way, viz., 5872 (Septuagint), 5551 (Augustine), 5515 (Theophilus), 5493 (Alexandrian date), and 3761 (Jewish date), etc. These are quite different from each other, namely by an oscillation amplitude of c. 2,100 years. The reason for the discrepancies might be the use of different abbreviations, or "word-dates" by different chronologists.



74 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
figures for the Latin letters, the "date", the year 1153, was obtained, differing from
the authentic 1496 = 1493 + 3 by 343 years. Thus, the documents using the abbreviated formula MCL. (...) to denote dates were shifted automatically downwards by c. 340 years. We have thereby formulated a universal hypothesis explaining, in our opinion, the reason for the appearance of different dates of the creation of the world and also for the chronological shifts leading to a substantial lengthening of chronology. In particular, this conjecture well accounts for the origin of the 333- and 1,053-year shifts. This mechanism turns out to generate also the shift by 1,778 years {~1,800). If the first two are most intimately related to Roman history, then the third is especially manifest in Greek and biblical chronology. We will call it Greco-biblical. And it is natural to call the first two shifts Roman.
3. The 1,800-year shift. Before analyzing the origin of the 1,800-year shift, we make one simple remark. Assume that a chronologist possesses two outwardly totally different texts written in different languages, employing different abbreviations, etc., but, actually, describing the same events. Suppose that one of them has already been dated. The question arises regarding the dating of the second. Two points of view concerning them are possible. The chronologist can discover in the first case that they describe the same events, but that the inexplicable abbreviations and worddates assume the year count with respect to some unknown calendar. He can also remain in the dark regarding textual proximity, and reckon that the texts describe different events, while the abbreviations and word-dates indicate the dates relative to a chronological system known to him, and being the same for both texts.
It is evident that, in the former case, another date of the creation of the world can arise, whereas, in the second, another rigid shift of one chronicle with respect to the other occurs, i.e., lengthening the chronology of history. I have stressed earlier that the existence of a whole series of different dates of the creation of the world can be probably accounted for by different spellings of the word-dates which are literal abbreviations of expanded verbal formulas. Let us recall the basic dates of the creation of the world: 5872 B.C. (Septuagint), 5551 B.C. (Augustine), 5515 B.C. {Theophilus), 5508 B.C. (Byzantine date), 5493 B.C. {Alexandrian date), 4700 B.C. (Samaritan date), 4004 B.C. (Hebrew date), 3941 B.C. (Jerome), 3761 B.C. (Jewish). Of the basic dates for the creation of the world, two are important for the chronology of Europe, viz., the Augustine {5551) and Jewish (3761) chronologies. Recall that it was Augustine who had given the periodization of global chronology by breaking the whole history into six epochs. Augustine's conception was predominant in Roman historiography during several centuries, whereas the latter date is closely related to dating the biblical events, the difference between them being 1,790 years, which almost coincides with the 1,800-year shift, and which could be due to the fact that the chronologists used different initial reference points. Assume that the events in a certain chronicle were dated since the creation of the world in 3761 B.C. A later chronologist adhering to Augustine's point of view could decide that they had been counted from 5551 B.C (by Augustine).
It is obvious that he thereby "lowered" the chronicle downwards by 1,790 years, i.e., made the Greco-biblical shift 1,800 years long without suspecting it himself.

We shall now demonstrate the action of the general machinery for writing the word-dates by this example, too. According to the GCD and the overlapping of the events described in the First and Second Book of the Chronicles with the history of the X-XIII cc. A.D., Nebuchadnezzar's attack occurred c. 1250 A.D. (which finally led to the Babylonian, or Avignon, captivity). Recall that 1230-1268 A.D. is the time of the medieval war in Italy, fall of the Hohenstaufen and establishment of the House of Anjou. It is probable that it was just this war which was the original of such wars as the Trojan war, the war with the Tarquins and Nebuchadnezzar (see the GCD). Assume that a chronicler, the author of religiously tinged annals, reckons years with respect to the popes, and denotes them by the popes' names, making by small numbers the period passed since the election or death. During Frederick II's rule (1212-1250), the principal pope who ruled for the greatest number of years was Gregory IX (1227-1241). The name "Gregory" is one of the most famous names among popes (e.g., Gregory Hildebrand, Gregory the Great, etc.) The chronicler could as well write the formula "4th year since Gregory", which corresponds to 1230 A.D. according to the modern calendar. Written in the Greek (Byzantine) way, it acquired
the form =ft fPO.A, where fP is the abbreviation of the name Gregory and A= 4. After the original meaning of this work-date had been forgotten, it was written standardly by mechanically substituting figures for letters in accordance with the tables then generally accepted. The chronicler eventually obtained the number 3174, whose value itself allegedly showed that the date had been counted from "some" creation of the world. Since the war with Nebuchadnezzar was described in the Bible, it was natural to assume that the Jewish date was chosen, i.e., 3761 B.C.
Therefore, from the standpoint of the chronologist-decoder, the date =ft fPO.A corresponded to 587 B.C. (since 3761 - 3174 = 587). Thus, he "calculated" the date when Nebuchadnezzar had attacked the kingdom of Judah. It is remarkable that 587 B.C. is mentioned in the modern traditional chronological tables for ancient history as the year of Nebuchadnezzar's attack [74], [39]. It remains to state that the chronologist made the events of the 13th c. A.D. c. 1,800 years older by this writing convention. Indeed, the original date is 1230 A.D. (the 4th year since Gregory), whereas the calculated date was 587 B.C., their difference being 1,817 years. Certainly, the above example is not at all unique, which illustrates the general machinery for the appearance of shifts. To facilitate the search for meaningful word-dates, N. A. Puchkov and N. S. Kellin tabulated the dates from 1700 B.C. to 1700 A.D. on a computer (at my request), written in ten ways in accordance with ten different calendars (the nine above and the Christian calendar). All these 34,000 numbers were represented as word-dates, figures denoted by letters in accordance with the Greek (Byzantine) system. From the point of view of the author's hypothesis regarding the occurrance of the shift, especially interesting are those words from the table that admit a natural writing as meaningful verbal formulas describing some other medieval events. It should be noted that a whole series of word-dates explicitly related to the name "Jesus" and the words "pope", "Gregory" and "Hildebrand" were discovered in the 11th c. A.D. First, recall the word-date S0Ilf (Jesus God Pope Gregory). We also illustrate by new examples, viz., E (iesiis), 1059 A.D. according to Jerome, EIS (iesiis, 1075 A.D., the year of the. Crucifixion written since



76 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
the creation of the word, according to Jerome), Ell (iesiis pope, 1076 A.D. during the rule of Gregory Hildebrand, written since the creation of the world in 4004 B.C.)
We have already given examples illustrating that certain chronicles were lowered downwards by the sums or differences of the basic three shifts. For covenience, we also give the matrix of pairwise differences between different dates for the creation of the world.
5967 5872 5551 5515 5508 5493 4700 4004 3941 3761 0 95 416 452 459 474 1267 1963 2026 2206 5967 0 321 357 364 379 1172 18681931 2111 5872 (Septuagint) 0 336 43 58 851 1547 1610 1790 5551 (Augustine) 0 7 22 815 1511 1574 1754 5515 (Theophilus) 0 15 808 1504 1567 1747 5508 (Byzantine date) 0 793 1489 1552 1732 5493 (Alexandrian date) 0 696 759 939 4700 (Samaritan date) 0 63 243 4004 (Hebrew date) 0 180 3941 (Jerome) 0 3761 (Jewish)
The number in the intersection of the ith row and jth column equals the difference of the ith and jth dates of the creation. It can immediately be seen that the 333year and 720-year shifts are represented in the table (viz., 321, 357, 364 and 696, 759), and equal the differences between the corresponding dates of the creation of the world. These numbers are underlined in the table. The 1,778-year shift('.:::'. 1,800 years) is also represented, viz., 1,790 years. We can also see that for 2,111 years, which is precisely the sum of the two basic shifts by 333 and 1,776 years. According to the GCD, the Babylonian(= Avignon) captivity probably started in 1305 A.D. Another important event occured in May 1305 in Corinth, where, in a sacred pine grove, the Poseidon games were staged in ancient times [45], the famous jousts, the first great "parliament" in the history of medieval Greece, took place. The latter lasted for about 20 days, and some ten thousand men took part. The tournament played an important role in the political history of contemporary (medieval) Greece [45]. Under the total shift by 2,111 years (which is the sum of the two basic shifts), it can be made coincident with another well-known event in Greek history, viz., the first Olympic games in 776 B.C., from which the reckoning with respect to Olympiads
started ([74], Table 5, A, VIII). In fact, 1305 + 776 = 2111. The first winner of the Olympic games was Horeb (= Corinth?) [74]. The difference in the month is insignificant (May and July).
It is probable that this event in 1305 A.D. was the starting point for a year count based on Olympiads. Note that the shift by 2,111 years can be also explained by the writing mechanism demonstrated above. Indeed, the year 1305 is the 65th year after the death of that very Gregory IX (1227-1241), whom we already know from the 1,800-year shift. Having written the verbal formula "65th year since Gregory" in
abbreviated form, we obtain-/= fP.SE (recall that the sign "-/=" admits the meaning "Jesus", i.e., the "Jesus era" is meant). A later chronologist, having forgotten the



Frequency Distributions 77
original meaning of the abbreviation, could understand all letters as figures, and obtain 3165. If he took this date as written with respect to the Jerome era (i.e., the 3165th year since the creation of the world in 3941 B.C.), then he could obtain
776 B.C., since 3941 - 3165 = 776. 'J;'hus, he obtained just that date for the start of the reckoning of years with respect to Olympiads, which is known to us from I. Scaliger's traditional chronology. It should be mentioned that the year count since Gregory IX in both examples generates the Greco-biblical shift of 1,778 years
(or 2,111 = 1,778 + 333).
5.19. Dionysius the Little
In conclusion, we exhibit a triple duplicate which is important for understanding the mechanism of the creation of the traditional chronology. It follows from the GCD (Fig. 65) that the parallel pairs of epochs were discovered earlier than those of I. Scaliger and D. Petavius, but not later. I. Scaliger and D. Petavius were the ones who had fixed traditional chronology. In other words, the events of medieval history were "lowered" by them if they had occured earlier than I. Scaliger's and D. Petavius' epoch; however, if they are dated by a later period, then they should not be lowered, and generate no duplicates, which indicates the special role played by these chronologists in creating traditional chronology.
The following three well-known Dionysii related to the Roman Church are known in European history, viz.,
Famous chronologist Dionysius, died in 265 A.D. (according to Eusebius). He paid especially much attention to calculation of Easter date
Under total shift by
1053 + 333 = 1386 years, Dionysius Petavius overlaps with Dionysius from 3rd c. A.D. Dionysius Petavius' death coincides exactly with that of Dio
nysius, viz., 1652-1386 = 266
Dionysius the Little (from 6th c. A.D.) is considered to be first author who calculated "Jesus' birth", which was 550 years before Dionysius
Famous chronologist Dionysius the Little (Exiguus), died in 6th c. A.D. In 563 A.D. - the so-called "Dionysius' pearl of Easter"
Under 1,053-year shift, Dionysius Petavius overlaps with Dionysius the Little from 6th c. A.D.,
viz., 1652 - 1053 = 599.
Exiguus in Latin means "Little".
Famous chronologist Dionysius Petavius (15831652). He also was engaged in Easter calculations. One of creators of chronology
French authors called
Dionysius Petavius = Pe
tit, or "Little". I. Scaliger and his disciples lived in France. Thus, terms "Petavius" and "Exiguus" are identical
Dionysius Petavius, I. Scaliger's disciple, created traditional chronology, and thereby indicated that "Hildebrand's birth" took place c. 600 years earlier. He died in 1652



78 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
There are several versions regarding the date of Dionysius the Little's death in the 6th c. A.D., viz., c. 540, c. 556, etc. I. Scaliger's and D. Petavius' chronology was born from the controversy surrounding these problems in the 16-17th cc. A.D. Their version was not unique (see above De Arcilla, J. Hardouin, I. Newton). The question arises: why do the rulers coincident under parallels have, mostly, different names? The answer is that ancient names are nicknames rather than names in the modern sense of the word; therefore, they all possess a meaningful translation, e.g., "enlightened" , "powerful" , etc.
It can also be asked why the medieval texts of, say, the 12th c. A.D. contain the names of personages whose originals turn out to have lived, e.g., in the 15th c. A.D. according to the GCD. The answer is that either they should be applied as nicknames to another historical character, or the 12th-c. document with the name is, actually, of later origin, because, e.g., the 330-year shift could as well "lower" the documents from the 15th c. to the 12th c. A.D.
The preserved ancient medieval chronicles are of multilayer character. They were obtained as compositions of individual fragments in the dating which the above errors could be made. The events from different epochs and occurring at different times could thereby be "frozen" into a unified narrative jet.
6. Some Other Independent Proofs of the Existence of Three Basic GCD Chronological Shifts
6.1. The list of Roman popes as the spinal colWIUl of medieval Roman history
In 1981, I applied the above method to the set of popes (pontifices) ordered in time. This list embraces (if dated traditionally) the period from the 1st c. A.D. until the present time [74), [119). However, according to the results I gathered and ordered on the GCD, it contains duplicates and repetitions (as well as the whole of ancient and medieval history up to the 13th c. A.D.). In other words, it is, probably, the result of repeated overlappings and gluing of several copies of the shorter list of popes, who allegedly lived later. Recall that the basic shifts generating the "lowering" of medieval documents from the 10-17th cc. A.D. are those by c. 333, 1,053 and 1,778 (::: 1,800) years. Since the list of popes embraces the period from the 1st c. A.D. until the present day, i.e., is substantially shorter than, say, that of the whole of Roman history until the 17th c. A.D., the greatest shift by c. 1,800 years does not show itself inside the list. Therefore, the basic shifts involved in forming the list of popes are those by 333 and 1,053 years, and also, possibly, their difference, the 720-year shift (see the GCD in Fig. 65). It is important that applying the above method to the list of popes yields consequences fully consistent with the conclusions made on the basis of the other methods discussed above.
The well-known list of popes is the spinal column of medieval Roman history (along with the list of emperors). Today's list is based on the Liber Pontificalis, whose origin can be reliably traced into antiquity to not earlier than the 13th c. A.D. [44). We have also used the data of [74], [44], [119], [13]. The history of the first



Some Other Independent Proofs 79
pope St. Peter and his seven successors, until Hyginus in 137-141 A.D., is regarded today as extremely uncertain according to J. Blair (74] or, e.g., S. G. Lozinsky: "Actually, reliable information about Roman bishops is available only starting with the 3rd c. A.D., but also with gaps ..." ([119], p. 312). Our method of dynastic parallels led to the discovery that the period of the Roman episcopate, from 140-314 A.D., overlaps 314-532 A.D. with the proximity coefficient 8.66 x 10-s. Recall that such a small value indicates the dependence of the two dynastic streams. Forty-three parallels of the total number of 47 were discovered in 141-532 A.D. (see the first and second periods above), and only four popes ruling for a short time were not taken into account (74]. Both streams are exceptionally representative. This patching together of church chronicles is fully consistent with the above independent gluing of the emperors' lists, i.e., with overlapping of the Second and Third Roman Empires. It is a consequence of the rigid shift by c. 333 years. The dating method based on the frequency-damping principle was applied to the popes' list in the interval from the 1st c. to the 17th c. A.D., then broken into 10-year intervals. A complete list was made of all popes beginning their rule in the lst-17th cc. A.D., and all 89 names were entered in the order of their appearance. The frequency matrix was constructed by A. Makarov (see below). Note that certain popes were called by substantially different names in the different tables. A rectangular matrix of order 89 x 170 was constructed. The values placed in each row represent the evolution of the frequencies of the mentioning of the names. There are altogether 89 rows (as well as names) and 170 columns (as well as decades). More precisely, for each name from the above list, those decades were marked in which at least one pope with the given name ruled for at least one year. For example, row 53 indicates all the decades in which pope John ruled for at least one year, viz., 523-526, 532-535, 560-573, 640-642, 635-636, 704-707, 872-882, 898-900, 914928, 931-936,956-963,965-972,983-984,985-996,997-998, 1003, 1003-1009, 10241033, 1258-1287, 1316-1334, 1410-1415 (Fig. 68). The square matrix of order 170 x 170 was then constructed (Fig. 68). I<(t 0 , t0 ), the numbers of popes ruling in a decade t0 , and whose names were not encountered before, were placed in the row t0 • I<(t 0 , t) indicates how many times the names first appearing in a decade t0 were mentioned in the popes' list in the decade t. Thus, the principle for matrix construction coincides with the general rule discussed above for the matrix J{ { t}. The obtained matrix was investigated on a computer by G. Nosovsky at my request and by the above algorithm, thus leading to the discovery of duplicates in the popes' list. In particular, a whole group of popes ruling in the 1st A.D. (e.g., Clement) according to traditional version, was unexpectedly born again in the 11th c. A.D. (!), which precisely corresponds to the shift by 1,0001,050 years, i.e., the second basic shift on the GCD. The general picture of this effect can be seen in the matrix J{ {t} (Fig. 68). All of the names first appearing in 50-260 A.D. then almost completely vanish for several hundred years, and the whole strip consisting of the first twenty rows is composed of zeroes only up to the year 1050, when they unexpectedly come back to life again; this powerful splash embraces 1050-1190 A.D., after which the frequency of use descreases again, though not identically to zero (see Fig. 68). The same result is obtained also by constructing

the graphs of K!ier(t). The other duplicates generated by the 333- and 720-year shifts were discovered similarly. Moreover, they are so explicit that they can be seen even on the averaged graph of Kaver(t), i.e., to discover tern, we can make use of a substantially rougher method than the construction of the K!ier(t) graphs. The graph of Kaver(t) is 170 units long and is shown in Fig. 68. Two principal maxima, certainly, without the first being associated with the principal diagonal, and shown in black in the figure, are seen clearly. Their distances from the first splash (i.e. from the principal diagonal) are just c. 360 and 730 years. Thus, both shifts by 333 and 720 years are automatically seen when averaging the matrix K {t} with respect to the diagonals parallel to the principal. The 1,053-year shift on the graph of Kaver(t) is not explicit, since the considerable frequency amplitudes due to those by 333 and 720 years "eclipse" the zero strip of the first twenty rows, which makes the shift manifest. It is important that after the discovery and identification of all these



Some Other Independent Proofs 81
duplicates, the newly calculated matrix K {t} ideally satisfies the frequency-damping principle both with respect to the rows and the columns. The agreement of these results with the duplicates of the system marked on the GCD is manifest (Fig. 65), e.g., for the name "John". The investigation of the enquete-codes of the principal heroes of the Trojan and Gothic {6th c. A.D.) wars, wars with the Tarquins (exile in the 6th c. B.C.) and in Italy in the 13th c. A.D., duplicates of the T series in Fig. 65, shows that they have the 13th-c. war as their "original". In Italy, John is one of the principal characters in the history of the T-series wars. We construct the graph by marking years from the 1st A.D. to the 17th c. A.D. off on the horizontal, and the frequency of the name "John" in the dynastic stream of popes on the vertical axis (see Fig. 68). It is explicitly seen that they concentrate around the mid-6th c. A.D., the end of the 7th c. A.D., 10th c. A.D. and the end of the 13th c. A.D. In other words, the concentration of "Johns" on the time axis is at the duplicates of the series T, denoted on the GCD and Figs. 65, 66 by black triangles. A duplicate of T, placed at the end of the 7th c. A.D., is localized in the Byzantine Empire, whose history is also subjected to "convolution". This is the time of the well-known crisis and war in Byzantine history, Justinian II (duplicate of Justinian I from the 6th c. A.D.). The duplicates of series Tin Byzantine history are sometimes different from their corresponding ones in the history of Rome by c. 100 years. In our case, Justinian I from the 6th c. and Justinian II from the end of the 7th c. A.D. are unique Justinians in the history of the Byzantine Empire. A similar method was applied to the same list of popes, but with their nationalities taken as "names" {the data taken from the traditional tables [74], [119]). As in the case of the name investigation, a rectangular matrix of 51 rows (according to the number of nationalities) and 170 columns (according to the number of decades) was made by A. Makarov. The nationalities were ordered as they appeared in the popes' list. We also include antipopes and gaps as two "names" in order to see the evolution of these two periods in the history of the papacy, too. We then constructed a square matrix of order 170 x 170 from the latter rectangular. Though satisfying the frequency-damping principle "to the first approximation" (i.e., the graph of Kaver(t) possesses one absolute and explicit maximum, and then more or less vanishes), the calculation of the graphs of K!ier(t) and KrJer(t) (see their definition above) showed that the list under investigation did contain duplicates. It is remarkable that the duplicates are associated with the same two basic shifts by c. 333 and 1,053 years and their difference of 720 years. Thus, the nationalities first appearing in 620630 A.D. completely vanish as soon as in two decades, and then again appear in 1380-1420 A.D. The difference between these two splashes is c. 750-760 years, which is quite close to the 720-year shift. The nationalities which first appear in 280290 A.D. then vanish after 320 A.D., and are again "reborn" in 640-650 A.D. as the only local splash in 320-340 years. These two splashes are unique in the whole of the matrix row. Thus, we have here an explicit expression of the shift by c. 333 years. Finally, the nationalities first appearing in 50-150 A.D. again reappear (after c. 1,050 years) in 1080-1210 A.D., which is, obviously, due to the 1,053-year shift. No other shifts were discovered in investigating the nationality matrix. The method for analyzing the graphs of K!ier(t) was also applied to the name matrix constructed by A. Makarov for the list of Byzantine patriarchs (pontifices), beginning with 317 A.D.



82 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
until 1690 A.O. However, the research has not been completed, because the frequency of the name use in the stream of Byzantine pontifices turned out to be considerably less than that of the popes, which makes the elements of the square matrix K {t} small, and the investigation of the graph more difficult.
We now describe the results of statistically processing the rectangular and square name frequency matrices constructed by V. P. Fomenko, T. G. Fomenko and the author for the Old and New Testament, broken into 218 chapters generations. The total number of different names mentioned there is 1,977, whereas that of multiple mentions reaches several tens of thousands. Thus, the rectangular matrix describing the evolution of biblical name frequences has 1,977 rows and 218 columns. The square matrix K{t} has 218 rows and the same number of columns (Fig. 30 (a), 30 (b)). For the square matrix of the parallel biblical passages, see Fig. 69. We have already described the results of the statistical investigation which led to the discovery of a series of new and earlier unknown Old and New Testament duplicates in our earlier publications. All of them are made manifest by the powerful repeated splashes in the averaged graphs of K!ler(t), i.e., the names first appearing in the chapter t0 are then again found in certain subsequent chapter generations. We now concentrate our attention on one of the principal duplicate series of form T (see the GCD in Figs. 65 and 66, upper line), which are the chapter generations listed below. We also indicate in parentheses their corresponding fragments from the Old and New Testament, and their spelling in terms of the standard division into books, usual chapters and verses. Thus, T: Chapter generation 1 (Genesis 1-3), T:15 (Genesis 6-8), T:49 (Genesis 11:1-9), T:60 (Genesis 12), T:73 (Genesis 39-50), T:74 (Exodus), T:97 (Book of Judges 19-21), T:98-102 (Ruth, First and second Books of Samuel, First Book of Kings 1-11), T:137 (Second Book of Kings 24), T:138-140 (First Book of the Chronicles and Second Book of the Chronicles 1-9), T:165-167 (Second Book of the Chronicles 34-36). Finally, the duplicates of the T series are the following chapter generations: 1, 15, 49, 60, 73, 74, 97, 98-102, 137, 138-140, 165-167. All of them are so explicit that they show themselves also upon applying other duplicate recognition methods.
6.2. The mean age of all old historical names and the frequency-damping principle for the matrix columns
We now give the results obtained on repeatedly investigating the same name frequency matrix, but from a somewhat different point of view. We mean the same repeated splashes of the graphs of K(t0 , t), but which are manifest if we apply a somewhat different method for the matrix investigation, realized by G. Nosovsky on a computer. Consider the sequence of chapter generations X(t), where t ranges from
1 to n = 218 in the case of the Old and New Testament. Fix t, and consider its cor
responding chapter X(t). Consider the rectangular name matrix and its companion square matrix K{t}. Then all the names mentioned in X(t) are distributed in the column t in the rectangular and square matrices. We call the number of chapter generations separating the name from the moment it appeared in the chapter X(t) for the first time its age. The age of the name placed in the intersection of the row t0 and column t, i.e., in block K(t0 , t), equals t - t0 , or the distance from K(to, t)

(1) Single out in X(t) all the names whose age c(e) is greater than zero. In other words, we do not take into account the new ones, appearing in this chapter for the
first time. It is clear that all new names are of age zero, since c(e) = t - t = 0; here

We formulate the following model, viz., for chapter generations ordered chronologically correctly, and with the absence of duplicates among them, the graph of a(t) as well as of c(t), where 1 ~ t ~ n must be of the approximate form shown in Fig. 70, where the mean age increases at the beginning of the text X, then the curve becomes stable, and, finally, an almost horizontal straight line.

In other words, the mean age a(t) (and c(t)) must oscillate about some constant which is the same for all chapter generations, and, at any rate, bounded above by c. 100 years. It means that the bulk of names, with the exception of, possibly, certain rare ones whose number is extremely small, vanish after approximately the same

number of generations. This model is, actually, a re-statement of the frequencydamping principle for the matrix columns; however, it can be advantageous in this form. That it is natural becomes clear ifwe recall that, for historical texts embracing
a large time interval, the identity "complete name = personage" is valid in the
overwhelming majority of cases. Hence, calculating for X(t) the mean name age, we thereby compute that of the personages described. Since this is bounded above by, say, one hundred years, most of the names cannot be older than a century, too. Therefore, the number of anomalously old names in X(t) should be negligibly small, compared with the bulk of the old ones. Generally, all the formulated laws are valid only for large totalities like collections of names, etc. Certainly, there will always be names of some famous historical figures who will be constantly mentioned, and form the anomalously old name set. However, as shown by computation, their percentage, or that of the historical figures, is negligibly small relative to the bulk of all used in the text; hence, we shall see that the appearance of a large number of anomalously old names is a weighty argument that we have discovered to be a duplicate.
6.3. Square matrix of biblical names and statistical duplicates in the Old and New Testament
The validity of the model was confirmed by processing the texts of ancient Russian chronicles written in the 15-16 cc. A.D., and those parts of the Old and New Testament, which do not contain any duplicates. Consider Case (1) above and analyze the old names. Indeed, counting the names of zero age allows us to construct the graph of a(t), and makes the general experimental picture somewhat more blurred, because the variance is increased. The graph of c(t) for the whole of the Old and New Testament is shown in Fig. 71. To get rid of small and random oscillations of the graph, we marked off the values 2[c(t)/2] ([] meaning the integer part of a real number) along the vertical. It can be clearly seen, e.g., that the graph of 2[c(t)/2] in a continuous line does oscillate around a certain constant value, the mean age for the fragment being made up of Chapters 70-86 without duplicates. The same is also valid for the one composed of Chapters 100-116. However, as soon as the experiment was extended to the entire sequence of chapters for the Old and New Testament, the repeated splashes indicating duplicates surfaced immediately. The graph of c(t) for Chapters 1-218 is represented in a continuous black line whereas the dashed line indicates the variance (Fig. 71). The anomaly of the graph shows that the mean age does not at all oscillate about a constant value, but is subject to sharp "aging" anomalies in certain chapter groups. For now, we confine ourselves to the Old Testament. The series T chapter duplicates are denoted by black triangles. The maxima of the 2[c(t)/2] graph are associated just with them, i.e., the chapters are characterized by aging the names sharply, and by employing the anomalously old ones; those in which the graph forms splashes are especially interesting. Consider Chapters 15, 35 and 48 in which it exhibits well-expressed splashes. We observe not only the use of anomalously old names, but also the variance minimum, i.e., practically all the names mentioned there are anomalously old. Most probably, the chapters are duplicates repeatedly describing the events already discussed in the



86 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
previous duplicates. For simplicity, we restricted ourselves only to the investigation of the series T duplicates. However, many other duplicates are contained in the Old and New Testament. Their distribution (and structure) is represented in the upper line of the GCD (Fig. 65). The graph of2[c(t)/2) reveals these duplicates with its own sufficiently powerful splashes. The greatest of them, which are different from those of the T series, correspond to the other Old and New Testament duplicates (Fig. 71). Similar results are obtained also by investigating the graph of a(t), which represents the mean age of all the names mentioned in X(t). The qualitative behaviour of the graph of a(t) is almost verbatim that of c(t), though with a somewhat more blurred picture, because the inclusion of new names of zero age turns out to increase the variance. We now come back to the analysis of the principal graph of c(t). No less interesting results are obtained if we analyze the second part of the graph which is related to the New Testament. On the one hand, we see here the sharp name aging and variance increase: Both graphs are on the increase. On the other hand, the aging of names of middle age makes explicit the following important law for whose description we distinguish a group A consisting of Chapters 1-137 (the historical part of the Old Testament), B of Chapters 138-191 (the last part of the Old Testament, made up of literary texts and books describing certain events from the end of period A), and C of Chapters 192-218 (the whole of the New Testament) (Fig. 71). The question arises: If the graph of c(t) is known, then how shall we learn from which one most of the names used in a generation t originate? The answer is that we have to consider the value c(t) at the point t, and mark it off toward the left, since c(t) equals the mean age of the name from X(t). In other words, we have to draw a line through c(t) (on the vertical axis passing through t) at an angle of 45° until it meets the horizontal axis, i.e., construct an isosceles triangle (Fig. 72).
Let us apply this simple argument to the authentic graph of c(t), constructed for the group B chapters (see above). It is seen to intersect the horizontal axis approximately between Chapters 99 and 137, i.e., the bulk of names used in Chapters 138-191 originates from Chapters 99-137. This result confirms the earlier-known availability of duplicates at the end of the group A. In fact, Chapters 138-191 consist of texts mainly depicting the events from the period already described in Chapters 99-137 in the First and Second Books of Samuel and the First and Second Books of Kings. This fact is generally known in traditional chronology. Thus, Chapters 138167, i.e., the First and Second Books of the Chronicles, simply duplicate Chapters 99-137. Therefore, our duplicate-recognition method is effective, and indicates the earlier-known repeated descriptions in the sequence of chapter generations. However, we also obtain new statements. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 71 that all chapters of group C (Nos. 192-218) from the New Testament also mostly contain the old names approximately originating from Chapters 110-120. To see this, one has to construct the above isosceles 45° triangle again. This, probably, indicates that the events described in the New Testament duplicate certain of those described earlier in Chapters 110-120. What are they? On the one hand, they were described in the First Book of Samuel 19-22 and the Second Book of Samuel 1-7 as the period of kings: in particular, the overlapping makes Jesus coincident with the king Asa, which we discovered earlier by the method of dynastic parallels. On the other hand, the dynastic parallel discovered shows that earlier the same events were described

in medieval Roman chronicles and occurred c. 1010-1100 A.D. in the Holy RomanGerman Empire in Italy. In particular, it was exactly the time of Gregory VII Hildebrand (c. 1020-1085 A.D., pope in 1073-1085) overlapping with Jesus according to the enquete-codes. We indicate below the overlapping of the well-known lunar eclipse of A.D. 33 during the Crucifixion with that of 1075 A.D. Recall also that it was, probably, with 1053 A.D. that the reckoning of years of the Christian era started, being directly related to the chronology and dating of the New Testament. Thus, we unexpectedly obtain a well-expressed agreement of several independent dating methods. Therefore, it is possible that the New Testament describes the events of the 11th c. A.D., and its principal character is Gregory VII Hildebrand. Meanwhile, John the Baptist overlaps with John Crescentius (985998 A.D.), whereas Herod overlaps with emperor Otto III (983-1002 A.D.). All these datings obtained by the author differ by 700 years from those suggested in [13], and by 1,000 years from the traditional dates.

Figure 72. How shall we learn the generation from which most of the names used in a generation to originate?
(Fig. 69). The total number of parallel passages amounts to several tens of thousands. We retained the partition of the whole text into 218 chapter generations, denoting the number of verses first appearing in the Bible in the chapter X(t 0 ) by II(t 0 , t0 ). A verse is regarded as appearing for the first time if it is not parallel to any one of earlier origin. Suppose that the number of mentions of these verses in X(t) is II(t0 , t), which, in other words, indicates the number of verses parallel to those in X(t), first appearing in X(t 0 ). As we have already stressed in earlier publications, the square matrix II{t} admits processing by the same method as K{t}, since, as was verified by the author, with the absence of duplicates and with chronologically correct ordering of the chapters, the matrix II{t} satisfied the frequency-damping principle both with respect to the rows and columns. As well as in the case of names, we introduce the concept of verse age and mean age in X(t). Let p(t) be the mean age of the old verses in X(t), of positive age. Following the procedure described above, G. Nosovsky constructed the graph of p(t) (see Figs. 73, 74).
Similarly to the case of names with the absence of duplicates and with correct ordering of chapter generations, the graph should have been oscillating around a certain mean value. However, this does not take place. The first half of the graph from Chapter 1 to Chapter 100 is of particularly great interest. The splashes of anomalously old verses are explicit. Moreover, they are characterized by zero variance for Chapters 1, 8 and 49. The duplicates of the series T are denoted by black triangles in Figs. 73, 74 (the remaining duplicates are not being considered in order to make the picture less complicated). The splashes near duplicates 15, 49, 73 and 74 are particularly well expressed. The picture gets more complicated afterwards, though duplicates 97-102, 137-140 and 165-167 (of the T series) also generate considerable splashes, whereas the remaining ones are associated with the other duplicates whose number is large (see the GCD in Figs. 65, 66). Summarizing, we see that the analysis of the graphs for the mean ages of names and verses confirms that the Bible contains duplicates distributed as in the GCD,

and texts, probably speaking of "the same events", but placed differently in the canon. It also indicates that, to restore the chronologically correct order of chapter generations, the chapters the Old and New Testament should be reshuffled by shifting them towards each other, i.e., both of these groups were, probably, created at the same, and not at different epochs as stated traditionally. The events described in the New Testament overlap with the epoch described in the First and Second Books of the Chronicles, and are, probably, those from the ll-13th cc. A.D. occurring in Italy during the epoch of the Holy Roman-German Empire. These corollaries are consistent with the results obtained by other dating methods, including astronomical methods [16], [19]-[22] (see Part 1). In conclusion, we give an interesting modification of the described methods for duplicate recognition, worked out and computerized by G. Nosovsky. This argument is actually based on the above-mentioned frequency-damping principle.
6.5. Scatterings of related names in chronological lists. The relation matrix
1. Introduction. Here, we consider certain methods for verifying the conjecture that a particular chronology contains duplicates [21]. All of them are based on the study of personal names mentioned in historical sources. Certain ideas regarding the organization and use of the data of this type with the purpose of dating are due to the author ([21], [24]). We introduce the concepts of a narrative source divided into chapter generations, chronological list of rulers' names also divided into chapters, and square and rectangular name frequency matrices corresponding to a partition into chapters. Note that, eventually, the frequency-damping principle formulated by the author in [24] is the basis of the methods under consideration. All the probabilistic models considered below are finite; thus, we use only classical probability theory. The whole procedure was computerized by G. Nosovsky in the language PL/1. A certain standard technique for coding square and rectangular name matrices was chosen, so that the same programmes could be used for computations involving various data such as name or nationality lists, narrative sources, etc. We omit the particulars related to the computational side of the matter. Items 2-9 regard the construction and study of the frequency histograms for related name scattering, and Items 10-16 deal with the construction and use of the name relation matrix in the chronological list of rulers. All the items consist of: 1. Introduction. 2. Name list. The structure of a list, the related probabilistic technique, definition
of random variables e1, 6, 63. Basic assumptions about the list with correct and incorrect chronology, use of frequency histograms for related name scattering in order to determine the chronological shifts.

2. Name list ofsecular or church rulers. Consider first the chronological list of secular or church rulers. Normally, each ruler has several names. We will assume that all the names of a ruler are listed consecutively in the appropriate place on the list, and that there are no separation signs between the names of neighbouring personages (in time). Order the list with respect to the middle year of the rule interval, and
denote it by X = {a1 , a2 , ... , aN}. We assume a decomposition of the list X into chapters X1, X2,, ... , Xn given. Denote by I= {u1, u2, ... , um}, m ~ N, the set of different names in X, and the name of the ith entry for X by u(a;), u(a;) EI.
Definition 1. We call the integer e(a;, ai) = lr- si the scattering of two list entries
a;, ai EX, a; E X 3 , ai E Xr.
Definition 2. We will say that two names u1, uk E I are of the same age, and
denote the fact by u 1 ~ uk, if their first occurrences are in one chapter of X.
Definition 3. We will say that two names ul> uk E I are conjugate, and denote the
fact by u 1 ~ uk, if there exists a chapter Xp in X, containing both. If two entries a; and ai from a list X are conjugate (or of the same age) as two names from I, then we will also call them conjugate (resp. of the same age), and employ the corresponding notation.
Consider a finite stochastic model (n, E, P) of sampling with equal probability
with replacement of two elements from X. Thus, n =X x X, E =2°, P( w) =1/N 2
for any w E n. We will denote the first selected element by a(l), and the second by a(2). Consider the scattering of the pair a(i), a(2),
(1)
It is a random variable defined on n.
We will assume that the events A= {w: a(l) ~ a(2)} and B = {w: a(l) ~ a(2)}
are non-zero, and P(A) # 0, P(B) -::p 0. Consider the conditional probabilities PA
and PB on n, viz.,
P(AC)
PA(C) = P(A) , P(BC)
PB(C) = P(B) , VCEE.



92 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
Denote by Ji, '2 and '3, respectively, the distributions of the random variable 6 relative to the probabilities P, PA and PB, viz.,
fi(k) = P(6 = k),
Let us consider the three random variables
6, 6, 6, 6(w) = 6(w) = 6(w),
which are defined on the three different probability spaces (f!, E, P), (f!, E, PA) and
(f!,E,PB) and have distributions /1, '2, and '3, respectively. In the sequel, we will also use the term "frequency histogram" for the distributions of random variables defined on a finite probability space.
In general, we will call the frequency histograms of random variables of type 6
and 6, i.e., the conditional distributions of the random variable 6 on a certain "locally" determinated condition, the related name scattering frequency histograms, meaning the "relation" in the sense of this condition. We will call the histogram
fi(k) = P(6 = k) simply a name scattering frequency histogram.
3. Correct and incorrect chronology in the name list. Frequency histograms. We now come to the investigation of the structure of the list X by comparing the distribution
of the random variable 6 with 6 and 6. In particular, the natural ideas of how the ruler's names should be arranged chronologically "correctly" lead us to the following statement.
(A) If the chronology of the name list is correct, then the condition u; ~ Uj ( or Ui ~ Uj) imposed on the names Ui, Uj from I does not influence the details of the mutual disposition of Ui, Uj with respect to the whole of X. It is clear that Statement (A) is closely related to the frequency-damping principle (see [24]): As a matter of fact, we assume that the "local" relations in the chronologically correct list must not lead to any global relations.
By means of l1, 6, 6, (A) can be made more precise as follows:
(B) The random variables 6, 6, 6 constructed from the chronologically correct
list should be distributed similarly. In other words, the distribution of 6 should not depend either on the event A or B. Remark. It is clear that a certain divergence of the distribution of 6 from 6 (or
6) will arise even in the case where (A) is valid, just because of the finiteness of the scheme. However, we consider here sufficiently long lists containing about 300 to 600 entries, and will neglect their finiteness. Assume now that the chronological list X under investigation contains some duplicates, with the system S1 , S2 , ... , Sm of the most frequent (typical) shifts among them. We do not suppose that X is divided into disjoint duplicate systems, for those from different groups may overlap (cf. the concept of "fibered chronicle" from [21]).
With this assumption, the distribution of the random variable 6 is naturally dependent on the condition (event) A (and B). In fact, if two names Ui and Uj fell into a chapter X1 (or were "born" there), then we should also expect them to be found among the duplicates of X1. Thus, the value of the scattering of any two entries in the list X containing them will more often be close to zero, and the shifts



Some Other Independent Proofs 93
typical of the given duplicate system, than that of an arbitrary pair of names from
I. Therefore, the histograms h and '3 will contain (in contrast with Ji) splashes near to the origin and the values of the shifts S1 , S2 , ... , Sm. Consider the problem of the verification of (B). We shall see that the distribution
of 6 has the same form in all the cases. Consequently, the problem is given rise as
to how to verify the hypothesis that the distribution of 6 (6) is close to a certain given one. It is natural to make the problem more precise as follows.
Consider the histogram h (or '3) as the empirical distribution on the set {O, 1, 2, ... , n - l}, constructed from a finite sample from the parent population, and verify the hypothesis Ho that the general distribution coincides with the given one on the set {O, 1, ... , n-1}. By the universe, we understand a probability space constructed from a certain unknown extension of the list in question. We take the number of chapters as invariable, and the chapter volume as increasing rapidly. Thus, we can include into the extended list the names of the relatives, courtiers, etc.; in the case of a narrative source, we enter all personages active in the country at that time. Hence, the parent population is constructed from all sorts of data both in preserved and lost sources. What was constructed from a known list can then be regarded as a finite sample from a very large, practically "infinite" population. This statement is rather general in the considered problems (see [18], where a similar situation arises). We assume that the available sample contains information just about the general distribution of the random variables considered in the above sense. In other words, any feasible way of selecting personages from a sufficiently long composite chronicle does not affect the distribution of the related name scatterings. In fact, this choice is always of "local" character, whereas the scattering distribution is a global characteristic, and stable under local perturbations.
4. Computation of histograms for real historical texts. It is easy to calculate that,
in the case of a uniformly dense list X = (a1 , a2, ... , aN) such that all the chapters
X;, i = l, 2, ... , n, contain the same number p of entries, the histogram fi(j) =
P(6 = j) linearly decreases on the set j E {1, 2, ... , n - 1}, fi(O) = 1/n and
Ji (j) = 0 for j < 0 and j ~ n.
In fact, 6 takes the value j in 2(n - j)p2 cases out of N 2 possible (IOI= N 2), since there exist n - j ways of fixing the chapter with the minor number; the chapter with the major number is fixed uniquely in accordance with the first one and number j, whereas the set of their name pairs with scattering j is of power p2 • The chapter with the minor number may appear at the first or at the second step of the sampling,
that is why the coefficient 2 appears in the formulae. If j = 0, then both chapters coincide and so the coefficient 2 is absent. Thus,
f ( .) _ P(' _ ") _ 2(n - j) 2 _ 2(n - j)
1 J - <.1 - J - 2N2 P - n2 ' 0 ~ j ~ n - l; 1
/i(O) = -n.
In the sequel, we will always suppose that the list under consideration is dense
sufficiently uniformly, i.e., the histogram Ji (j) is linear with respect to j on the set {1, ... , n-1}. For example, computations show that this condition is mostly fulfilled to a very high accuracy for the lists of popes' names. In some cases, especially when we work with the name lists, extracted from historical texts, it is necessary to norm the inhomogeneous list in order to satisfy the mentioned condition.



94 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
We can determine the histogram h(j) = PA(6 = j) by means of the square name matrix Knxn associated with the given list [24]. Therefore, the formula is valid:
n n-j
} 2 L L K(i, s + j)K(i, s),
i=l $=i
0 ~ j ~ n - 1,
h(j) = (2)
j = 0,
0 otherwise,
where K(·, •) are the elements of Knxn• Formula (2) follows directly from the definition of the random variable 6 and K (i, s) being the total of the multiple names from the set of those "born" in X;, which get into the chapter X$. The square matrix is insufficient for the construction of fs. Therefore, we have to resort to a rectangular name matrix supplying complete information regarding chapters of the list (see [21]).
5. Histograms related to the name and nationality lists of Roman popes. We now
discuss the construction of the histograms Ji and '2, related to the lists II and H of well-known popes and their nationalities from A.D. 50 (Peter) until the present day (see, e.g., [119]). Characteristically, the names or nationalities have no explicit succession in these lists. Accordingly, there are good grounds to believe that Statement (B) should be fulfilled if the above lists are chronologically correct. Note that if we do assume the existence of a succession, then a hypothetically correct chronology
can only explain the splash near the origin on the histograms '2 and '3 (see Item 6).
We divided II and H into 10-year long chapters, the lists' length being N = 293,
the number of chapters n = 190, and that of the different names k = 87. We made use of the rectangular and square matrices constructed from II and H by A. A. Makarov. We found by direct computation that the histogram / 1(j) for II and H is, to a
very high accuracy, a linear decreasing function for j = 1, ... , n - 1. See the form of
'2 in Figs. 75, 76. On the abscissa, the values of the scatterings were recalculated into years. It can be seen that '2 for II possesses a series of sharp splashes. According to the
above argument, we can single out the following groups of shifts for '2 and II, viz.,
(i) by 40-50 and (doubling it) 80-100 years,
(ii) by 300 and 330-350 years,
(iii) the group of 11 consecutive shifts separated by c. 100 years by: 400, 480, 580, 670, 760, 850, 940, 1,050, 1,140, 1,230 years, and
(iv) by 1,400 years.

Besides, we observe an exceptionally sharp, four-fold splash near the origin. The shifts by 330, 400, 760, 850, 960, 1,050, 1,150 and 1,400 years are also explicit.
The histogram h for H supplies much less information, and contains two sharp splashes about the origin and 600-640 years as well as two weaker ones around 330 and 450 years, which can probably be explained by the popes' nationalities having been determined in a doubtful manner. (See also Figs. 77, 78 and Item 8.)
6. Damping succession in a historical chronicle. Consider now a historical source separated into chapter generations X1, X2, ... , Xn. Select from each chapter all personal names with their multiplicities, and indicate their numbers. Note that we mean here personal and incomplete names, i.e., break each complete composite name into separate ones. We then obtain the same name collection divided into chapters as the one considered in Item 2. The related names and those of the same age, as well

as the random variables {1, 6, 6 and their frequency histograms /i, /2, fa, will be defined similarly. However, there exists in a historical source a natural dependence of the name set in X; on that in Xi±1 (for small /). We call this dependence a damping succession.
The existence of a damping succession in a narrative source leads to the necessity of making Statement (A) precise, and altering (B). In fact, if two names u; and Uj are in some chapter Xm, then even a local relation leads to a statistically strong relation, with u; and Uj being repeatedly encountered in Xm and neighbouring chapters, which implies splashes near the origin on the frequency histograms /2 and
fa. Therefore, for a narrative source, Statement (B) is replaced by the following. (C) If the chronology of a source with damping succession is correct, and histogram
fi(j) = P(6 = j) is linearly decreasing, then '2 and h should monotonically



Some Other Independent Proofs 97
decrease at 0, 1, ... , n :-- 1. To apply (C) to the problem of verification of the chronology of narrative sources,
it is necessary that fi(j) = P(6 = j) be linearly decreasing, which is, however, incorrect in the general case. As a matter of fact, narrative sources often are composite, and their chapter volume is sharply non-uniform, of which the Bible is a
good example. It is easy to see that the name scattering histogram Ji will then have splashes at the values of the distances between detailed chapters with large numbers of names. The study of scatterings between detailed source chapters may also be useful
in determining the duplicate shifts. The biblical name histogram Ji consists of a series of strong splashes, viz., 0, 420, 650, 1,050, 1,300 and 1,600-1,800 years. The recalculation into years was performed, assuming 17 years for one chapter generation. To apply Statement (C) to a narrative source, we assume that the number of mentions of a person involved in a historical event is directly proportional to the length of a chronicle describing it. With this assumption in mind, we can norm the source by dividing the multiplicity of the name occurring in a chapter by the total number of the mentioned names. For simplicity, all fractions will be reduced to the least common denominator. We will speak of a normed source or a normed source matrix in the following, implying the above norming procedure. It is clear that a normed source is uniformly dense relative to the chapters; con
sequently, the histogram Ji is a linearly decreasing function (see Item 4).
7. Results related to the lists of biblical names and parallel passages. We now describe the results related to the normed lists B and M (see Item 6) of the biblical names and parallel passages, or repetitions [24) (for their separation into chapter generations, see [21)). Containing tens of thousands of elements and several thou
sand different names, they were divided into n = 218 chapters (see the form of the
frequency histograms h in Figs. 79, 80). Both graphs possess sharp splashes in the interval 0 ~ j ~ n - 1. We indicate the

values of scatterings in years and chapters-generations (in parentheses), assuming each is 17 years long. We distinguish the following shifts, viz., 170(10), 330(19), 410(24), 500(29-32), 650-700(36-41), 1100(65), 1,250(73), 1,500-1,700(92-102) in Band 500(30), 650(37), 1,250(72), 1,550(96), 2,000(120) in M, the first two being the strongest. Their values in years were found indirectly by recomputing the generations, and are, therefore, less exact than for the lists, e.g., of the popes, with a natural annual scale (see also Figs. 81, 82, 83 and Item 8). See also Figs. 91, 92 in Appendix 1.
8. Chronological shifts between the duplicates in chronologically incorrect chronicles. We have already stressed in Item 3 that the basic Statement (A) means that local relations must not lead to global ones in a chronologically correct list. There, we considered two local conditions for name pairs. Now we present additional examples of local conditions. Take the probabilistic scheme from Item 2. Let C be a certain subset of the list

of chapters, viz., C = {X;1 , .•• , X;1}. We will say that two names u;, Uj from Care
C
of the same age (u; ~ Uj) if they were "born" in one of its chapters. We will call u;
and Uj conjugate in C (u; £ Uj) if they were mentioned in one of its chapters, and
write a; g a1, or a; £ ai, if the corresponding relation is valid for the two entries in
X as name from I.
Defining the events Ac = {w : a(l) g a(2)}, Be = {w : a(i) £ a(2)}, w =
(a(i), a(2)), we consider the frequency histograms for the names related in C as in
Item 2, viz., ff (j) = PAc(6 = j) = P({f = j),
ff (j) =PBc(6 =j) =P({f =j),



100 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
where the random variables 6 and 6 are defined on the probability spaces (0, I:, PAc) and (0, I:, PBc ), respectively,
6(w) = ef(w) = ef(w), w E 0.
By means of ff, ff, h and /3, we can also determine the shifts between the duplicates in chronologically incorrect lists. However, those determined by the sys
tem of chapter duplicates in C can be found from ff and ff with the help of the machinery described in Item 3, whereas the duplicates themselves may not belong
to C. Investigating ff or ff for different C, we can study the shift structure in
more detail (certain examples of ff for list IT of the popes, list H of their nation
alities, list B of biblical names and list M of parallel biblical passages are shown in Figs. 77-78, 81-83).
9. The card-deck problem and chronology. Here, we discuss the problem modelling the mechanism of how incorrect chronology is formed by giving the example of card shuffling. Nothing prevents us from assuming that a deck is shuffled in the same manner as the duplicates in chronologically incorrect lists. Note that the problem is not well posed but only restates the initial one in simpler terms, and is the principal basis for working out the methods under consideration. Suppose there were originally several decks of cards, identical in composition and (unknown) order Po. Assume that the cards were then put in one large deck F and shuffled, obtaining a new order Pi. Suppose that the "traces" of the initial order Po are retained in F, i.e., the shuffling is "incomplete", and that the number of the original decks (and their volumes) is unknown, only assuming it to be considerably less than the volumes. How can we learn for a certain Po whether or not the deck F with order P 1 was obtained by the same method, and what the initial order Po was? The natural approach is the search of similar pieces in F. The more similar pieces are found, the more assuredly we can assert that a particular piece preserves the influence of Po. Thus, we can attempt to restore Po piecewise. Besides, by investigating in F the mutual disposition of similar pieces, we can determine whether or not the order P 1 is obtained, on the basis of inserting several decks with order Po that are somehow shifted relative to each other, as is always done in shuffling, and also find the shift values. We should, therefore, construct the frequency histogram for the "distances" between the similar pieces and see if there are typical ones. If such values are there, and the histogram does possess sharp splashes, then they can be naturally regarded as the shifts between the portions influenced by P0 . The simplest piece is two consecutive cards. If F was, in fact, obtained by means of the described mechanism, then we can expect a considerable number of nearby cards in the final deck to be neighbouring also in the original ones. Therefore, the frequency histogram for scatterings between the cards which were placed side by side in F should at least once make splashes around the values of the typical shifts between the "duplicates". An argument of this sort leads to the study of the frequency histograms for names related in chronological lists. Similarly, we can also model the methods considered below.



Some Other Independent Proofs 101
10. Relation matrix: preliminaries. We now turn to the relation matrix constructed from a given chronological list. We will employ the notation from Item 2. By means of the frequency histograms of related names in Items 2-9, we verified the hypothesis about the existence of duplicates in a chronological list, and determined the values of typical shifts among them, but did not find exactly which parts of the list were duplicates. Recall that, in accordance with the concept of a fibered chronicle, two parts of a list are regarded as duplicates if they contain fibers repeating each other [11], [12], [21]. We now turn to the card-deck problem. We call two parts of the final deck F duplicates if they contain cards numbered identically or similarly before shuffiing the original deck. Thus, parts Li1 and Li2 of F are regarded to be duplicates if they contain the subsets A C Li1 and B C Li2 such that the cards from A and B were originally among the copies of the same sufficiently small, connected piece Li of the original deck. Note that Li1 and Li2 may contain no identical cards at all, since it is
possible that An B = 0. However, in shuffiing incompletely, there must be copies
of Li, distributed in F with certain cards from A and B not far from each other, which means, in the case where Li1 and Li2 contain fragments resulting from the
common inverse image of Li, that the probability increases of two cards from Li1 and Li2, respectively, being close somewhere in F. This fact can be used for making the concept of "similarity" of pieces in F more precise, and for introducing a relation measure for them on the basis of the quantity of such card interaction. We now carry out a detailed investigation into long chronological lists. Let there be a list X which may contain errors, omissions and/or duplicates. We denote by Y an unknown original list on which X is based. Thus, Y is an imaginary list containing complete data of a certain sort (say, about the names of rulers) for a long historical time interval Ty. Let Ty be described by a number of chroniclers, each making his own short list Z for the contemporary events. Denote by {Z;} the set of these, forming a certain covering of Y, assumed to be sufficiently dense (with large multiplicity), and containing somehow dispersed and, possibly, erroneous pieces, with each of the Z; mentioning neither all the ruler's names nor all of the personages; besides, errors and gaps could occur in rewriting and compiling, which we will assume, for simplicity, to be intrinsic to Z; from the beginning. In creating chronology in its contemporary form, the result was a certain new gluing of Z;, and the known list X obtained. Consider two intervals Li1 and Li2 in X. Let us try to determine whether or not there is a pair Z;, Z; in X, which would be related to one period in Y, and glued to Li1 and Li2, respectively. As in the example with the cards, we conclude that if there is such a pair, then the probability increases that the names from Li1 and Li2 will be close somewhere in X, on account of a third,
"gluing'' chronicle z. (see the detailed mathematical treatment in [316]).
11. Principal definitions. Assumptions about the structure of a correct chronological text. For now, we neglect the partition of a list into chapters. In contrast to the problem of determining the shift values, to construct the relation matrix, the time scale was not used in the list. After constructing the matrix, we again make use of it in the analysis of the results. To define the concepts of piece of a list and proximity in a list, we introduce the



102 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
following definitions. Definition 4. We call the set
k < i < N - k,
the determining neighbourhood of radius k for the ith entry a; of the list X =
{a1, ... , aN}. We also call 2k + 1 the length of the determining neighbourhood and do not introduce the concept for the extreme terms. We denote Ll;(k) or simply Ll;, and sometimes omit the term "determining".
Definition 5. We call the number lo(u;,u;) of pairs (a8 ,ar), u(a8 ) = u;, u(ar) =
u; of non-coincident entries of the list X, such that js - rj < p, the non-normed relation of two names u; and u;. We also call the natural number p the length of the relating neighbourhpod.
Parameters k and p were chosen in accordance with the list. Note that the general form of the relation matrix was invariable for all the considered values of k and p, 1 ~ k ~ 7, 3 ~ p ~ 17, in all the above examples, so that this choice did not influence the result itself (decomposition of the list into a duplicate system), but only its precision. The non-normed relation /0 ( u;, u;) is inconvenient, because it does not take into account sharp differences in the multiplicities of the names from I, which are characteristic in the examples in question. Meanwhile, a pair of frequent names should naturally be at a close distance in X more often than a pair of rarer ones. To eliminate the influence of the multiplicity of names on their relation, we introduce the following definition. Definition 6. Let two names u;, u; E 1 be in a list X with multiplicities k; and k;, respectively. We call the number
l(u· u·)-{l0 (u;,u;)/(2k; x k;)
'' 3 - lo(u;, u;)/(k;(k; - 1))
for if; j,
for i = j, k; > 1
the (normed) relation of a pair of the names u; and u;.
By definition, we put l(ar, a8 ) = l(u(ar), u(a8 )) for ar, a8 E X. We chose the norming procedure in Definition 6, so that, assuming that for the given name set
I = {u1, ... , Um} with multiplicities k1, k2 , •.• , km, all permutations in the correct
list X may be equally probable, (in other words the names in the chronologically correct list may be distributed at random, and the knowledge of only the name set with multiplicities does not supply any information regarding the particulars of their position in the list), and the relation of two names in X may be a random variable with mean not depending on the choice of a name pair. This (general) mean will be called mean with respect to the permutations in contrast with the empirical mean with respect to the matrix. This assumption is confirmed indirectly by the coincidence (in the correct lists) of the theoretically general mean a calculated by formula (3), with the empirical mean with respect to the matrix, whereas for the lists with duplicates, as had to be expected, the mean relation with the matrix is slightly greater than a. Note that the said assumption does not influence the qualitative form of the results. In particular, the basic features of the essential relation matrix are also preserved in using the non-normed values of the relation.



Some Other Independent Proofs 103
Denote the relation name mean with respect to the permutations by
(3)
for any pair (i, j), except for the case where i = j and Ui is a unique name in the list (we do not consider such pairs). We also assume with respect to X that the
multiplicity of any name in it is much less than its length IXI = N.
Fix the length p, p ~ N, of the relating neighbourhood. We may then calculate that, with the said assumptions, the mean non-normed relation 10 ( Ui, Uj) of the pair of names Ui and Uj with multiplicities ki and kj, respectively, is proportional to
(k k ) { 2ki x kj,
c i, i = ki(ki - 1),
i :/= j,
i = j. (4)
By definition, we put c(ar, a 3 ) = c(k;, kj), u(ar) = Ui, u(a3 ) = Uj, for ar, a3 EX.
Here, we discuss the calculation of the mean M 10( u;, Uj) for the case i :/= j. We can represent the scheme of equally likely permutations of names in X as the result of the consecutive placing of N names in N positions in the list, each name occupying one of the remaining vacant places with the same probability. Meanwhile, their turn to be placed can be chosen arbitrarily but must be fixed a'priori. We will assume that,before placing kj of copies of a name Uj, all k; of the copies of u; have already been placed. By assumption, ki, kj, p ~ N; therefore, we will neglect the number of cases where two copies of u; turned out to be nearby at a distance of less than p in the list X, compared with the total number of methods of placing ki. We now represent the placing of kj of the copies of u; as a Bernoulli test sequence, and regard the trial as a success if it gets into a relating neighbourhood along with one of the copies of u; already placed. Then 10 ( u;, Uj) equals the number of successes, and the probability of a success in one trial is proportional to ki, whereas the number of trials equals k;; therefore the mean number of successes is proportional to k; x k;.
The case i = j is considered similarly. Thus, the mean Ml( u;, Uj) does not depend
on the pair (Ui, Uj) except if Ui = Uj is a unique name in the list.
12. Relation measure. The problem of separation of strong and weak relations in a chronicle. In accordance with the assumptions of Item 10 regarding the duplicate appearance mechanism, we introduce a relation measure for two determining neighbourhoods Ar(k) and A 3 (k), k < r ~ s < N - k, in the list X, viz.,
$L+k l(ai,aj), (5)
j:3-k
where c is a certain convenient constant.
Definition 7. The number L 0 (Lir(k), A 3 (k)) is called the relation of two neighbourhoods Ar (k) and A3 ( k) in the list X. If X contains no duplicates, and the assumptions of Item 11 are valid, then as seen from (5), the mean value of the relation Lo(Ar, A 3 ) does not depend on Ar and A 3 , and equals c •o:, where c and o: were defined in (3) and (4). Here, we imply the mean with respect to the permutations where r and s are fixed.



104 Methods for the Statistical Analysis of Narrative Texts
Let us see how the value of the relation of the neighbourhoods Ar and A. alters on account of their common duplicates. The following definition is introduced to make precise how much the relation increases because of one of their common "complete" duplicates in X, i.e., such a connected piece in X which is not longer than the relating neighbourhood, containing one copy of each name from Ar and A. (taking the multiplicities into account). Ifwe represent Ar and A, as two chronicles having a common inverse image from Y, then the complete duplicate is the complete chronicle combining the names of these two. Definition 8. We call the number
r+k
Eo(Ar(k), A.(k)) = c 2 I:
(2k + 1) i=r-k
where 6;; = 1 ifi = j, and= 0 otherwise, and c(a;,a;) was defined in (4), c is the multiplier from (5), the proper relations unit for two defining neighbourhoods.
Let X contain duplicates. We call two determining neighbourhoods independent if they have no common duplicates and are non-intersecting in X. We call the remaining neighbourhood pairs dependent. We assume for simplicity that there are few duplicates, so that the relation between two independent neighbourhoods is similar to the correct list. Consider the three followings cases, viz.:
(1) The neighbourhoods Ar and A. are independent. Then the mean value of their relation equals c •a.
(2) The neighbourhoods Ar and A. coincide, with Ar having no duplicates. The
mean value of the relation in this case equals ca + E 0( Ar, A.), and the neighbourhood is its complete duplicate.
(3) Two non-intersecting neighbourhoods Ar and A. in X possess j common com
plete duplicates. The mean value of their relation is then equal to ca + j- E 0 (Ar, A.). We have to separate cases (1) and (3), for which we shall try to find the optimal radius of the determining neighbourhood (radius k). Note that, by increasing k we decrease the scattering with respect to a (the variance of the relation Lo), which increases the precision of the separation. However, for too large k, the duplicate completion degree lessens, thus leading to actually decreasing the factor j in (3). The value of k must not exceed the typical length of the elementary chronicle Z; (see Item 10). The optimal value is chosen from experience.
Remark. Since the system {Ak+1, Ak+2, ... , AN-k-d is that of "current" neighbourhoods in the list X, less pure neighbourhood duplicates than the "precise" one are neighbouring to it. To distinguish the most complete duplicates, we will only retain local maxima in the relation matrix ar, = L0(Ar, A.) and consider the relation Lo(Ar, A.) only in the case when Lo(Ar, A,) ~ Lo(Ar, A.-1) - £, and Lo(Ar, A.)~ Lo(Ar, A.+1)- £, or else it is replaced by zero. This remark does not concern the construction of the frequency histograms (see below). The value of£ was chosen to be equal to the length of the interval to be divided in constructing the frequency histogram (see Item 13).



Some Other Independent Proofs 105
Before turning our attention to the results, we describe certain statistical particularities discovered in the above example, and consider a qualitative method for determining the thresholds for separating cases (1) and (3). Note that all the qualitative arguments and the subsequent items are confirmed a posteriori, because they lead to a more precise picture of the distribution of the essential relations with respect to the matrix. However, general characteristics of relation matrix are stable under the threshold value oscillations, parameters k and p (i.e., lengths of the determining and connecting neighbourhoods), and also certain changes in the definition of the relation (see Item 13).
13. Frequency histograms for the appearance of relations. The choice of thresholds. Below, in constructing certain frequency histograms for the appearance of relations in a matrix, we shall have to break the interval where the relation is measured into equal disjoint segments. We will simply assume that the value of the relation is replaced by its integral parts (on account of the choice of the factor c in (5), we can reduce the general case to the above). We now study how the relation between two neighbourhoods in X and the number of common names are connected. By definition, the number of common names (taken with multiplicities) of neighbourhoods Ar and A. is the number of pairs from Ar x A. such that they contain indentical names, viz.,
r+k •+k
O(Ar(k), A3 (k)) = L '°' ba-a·,·
L.J ., J
i=r-k i=•-k
ba-a·={l,
., J 0 u(a;) = u(aj),
otherwise.
We denote by II the list of the names of Roman popes, and by N the list of the names of Roman emperors. It turns out that, provided that O(Ar, A.) is fixed, the frequency histograms Lo(Ar, A.) with respect to the matrix for II and N indicate that the dependence of Lo(Ar, A.) and O(Ar, A3 ) is expressed in explicit terms, viz., as the number of common names increases, the relation increases, too (in the statistical sense). It may seem that the relation Lo increases directly on account of the common names, since the mechanisms leading to such an increase do exist. However, this is not so. For a demonstration, we introduce two additional relation measures. Consider a neighbourhood pair Ar(k) and A.(k), then
Ar :J A~ = {set of entries of Ar with different names},
A. :J A~ = { set of entries of A. with different names},
A~ :J A~.• = {set of entries of A~ whose names do not coincide with those from
A:}.
Thus, the neighbourhoods A~ and A: contain one representative of each name;
besides, A: and A~• contain no common names. Denote the length (number of
terms) of a neighbo~rhood by I· 1- By definition, we put

(it is easy to verify that L2(Ar, As) = L2(As, Ar)). The quantity L2(Ar, As) is in no way related to the common names in Ar and
As; they are not involved in its definition. However, the conditional frequency histograms for L2(Ar, As) for the lists II and N calculated with the fixed value of O(Ar, As) show that the dependence of L2 on O(Ar, As) is the same as that of Lo on O(Ar, As)- The same is valid for L1(Ar, As), which signifies that a certain common factor leading to their statistical dependence is at the foundation of two outwardly unrelated quantities L2{Ar, As) and O{Ar, As)- It is clear that the availability of common duplicates is a factor of this kind. Hence, the discovered dependence speaks for the hypothesis regarding the existence of duplicates in II and N. The relation matrices for II and N constructed by means of Lo, L1 or L2, respectively, turned out to lead to the same conclusion, i.e., to distinguish the same duplicate systems. Therefore, we shall sometimes simply write L(Ar, As), meaning one of their three relations Lo, L1 or L2. Note the difference between the relation matrices constructed by means of L(Ar,
As) and that derived from the common names for II and N, viz., that the former yield a more complete and "purer" picture. In particular, if the value of O{Ar, As) is large, then, as a rule, L(Ar, As) is large; however, the converse is not valid. The thresholds separating strong relations (which should lead to the conclusion regarding the dependence of neighbourhoods) from the weak ones (the conclusion being that the neighbourhoods are independent) were chosen in accordance with the magnitude of O{Ar, As) as follows: the relation conditional frequency histograms
were constructed from the matrix ars = L(Ar, As) with the number of common
names 0(Ar, A 8 ) being fixed. For the lists II and N, all these histograms were of the form as in Fig. 84. The smallest values taken as the thresholds were to the right of which the histogram was vanishing. The relations exceeding the threshold value are called below essential. Note that all the intersecting neighbourhoods for the II and N, as expected, turned out to be dependent according to the constructed test (i.e., their relations were essential).
14. Results related to the name list of Roman popes. Chronological shifts. Here and in the next items, we consider the consequences of the study of the relation matrix for the popes' lists, from Peter until 1950, and the Roman kings' and emperors' list from the 8th c. B.C. (starting from the 4th c. A.D., we mean here the Western Roman Empire) until the Holy Roman Empire in 962-1254 and the Hapsburg Empire in 1273-1619 A.D., the emperors' list extended up to 1700 A.D. (up to Leopold). To make the discussion of the results independent of the above argument, we recall the basic ideas of the method. The so-called relation matrix is constructed from a large chronological list of rulers' names, for which each pair of connected fixed-length pieces (neighbourhoods) is associated with a number (relation), so that the following conditions are fulfilled, viz., in the case where the given list contains no duplicates and consists of a random (in a sense) name sequence, the mean value of the relation does not depend on the choice of the numbers of the neighbourhood pairs, and, in the case where the list does contain duplicates, the relation of the pairs possessing duplicating fibers is, in general, greater than for those without such fibers.

By means of the study of the relation conditional distribution frequency histograms in the matrix in condition of a fixed number of common names in the neighbourhoods, thresholds were then defined, separating the essential relations (the conclusion being that the neighbourhoods do contain duplicating fibers) and inessential relations (with the conclusion that the neighbourhoods are independent) (Fig. 84). The essential relation matrix (or, simply, relation matrix) thus obtained provides for a decomposition of the list into duplicate systems (meanwhile, different systems can intersect, i.e., certain parts of the list can possibly ''fiber"). We note briefly certain overlappings determined by the constructed matrices. All of them are completely consistent with the GCD decomposition obtained by the author.

Besides, the author's conclusion regarding the existence of authentic consecutive chronology only after 900 A.D. and reliable chronology from the end of the 13th c. A.D. is confirmed fully (see Figs. 85, 86).
The popes' list for 50-1950 A.D. contains 87 different names of the total number of 293, their maximum multiplicity being 21. The essential relation matrix is shown in Fig. 85. Note immediately that the interval 1700-1950 A.D. contains no duplicates, whereas 1600-1700 A.D. is comparatively weakly related only to certain epochs after 1100 A.D., with the only stronger relation being to the interval 1180-1260 A.D. The list of duplicate systems is given below in accordance with Fig. 85. The arrows denote relations with the (key) time interval which appears first in each line, whereas the dashed arrows denote comparactively weak relations. The interval time limits are accurate up to a century (see the details in Fig. 85). The right-hand column

15. The list of names of Roman emperors and the related chronological shifts. The list is constructed from the names of Roman emperors from Romulus (753 B.C.) to Leopold I (c. 1700 A.D.). If several names of one emperor are known, then they are all written out one by one. The ordering is made relative to the rules' middle years, the list contains no separation signs between the names of consecutive emperors, its length is 555, the number of different names 193, and the maximal name multiplicity 40 (see the essential relation matrix in Fig. 86). Similarly to the previous item, we also list the distinguished duplicate systems and generated shifts. The Roman numerals denote centuries, whereas the subscripts 1 or 2 designate the first or second half of the century, respectively.

Some Other Independent Proofs 111
This matrix determines the decomposition of the emperors' list into duplicate series coincident with those found by the author in the investigation of dynastic parallels. For example, the overlapping of the two Roman Empires in 82 B.C.217 A.D. and 270-526 A.D. is reflected in the area of dots which form the diagonal parallel to the principal diagonal (see Fig. 86). It means that these duplicates overlap with nearly no distorsions. The duplicate series T of the GTR-war is also explicit.
16. The comparison of the results obtained with the decomposition in the Global Chronological Diagram. The present study was carried out by the author and G. Nosovsky in 1983-1984 with the purpose of independent verification of the GCD (e.g., see [24] or a more detailed treatment in [21]). Finally, two circumstances were made clear. (1) Ancient and medieval historical data possess explicit statistical duplicates only for documents appearing earlier than the 13th c. A.D., which cannot be explained on the basis of the natural ideas of "correct chronology", but which can be explained by the hypothetical existence of chronological duplicates in the form given by the author. (2) If the hypothesis regarding the existence of chronological duplicates is accepted, then the interpretation of the obtained results leads to the same results as those derived by the author earlier (viz., the GCD decomposition). It is essential that the GCD decomposition was originally constructed from the dynastic rule durations. Derived by proceeding from the dynastic name set, the same conclusions supply an independent confirmation of the author's hypothesis.

1.1. Ancient sources and their origin. Tacitus and Bracciolini
The skeleton of historical chronology was constructed by analyzing the chronological data of ancient sources, based on which we have to study the problem of their origin. No complete detailed survey of the circumstances in which ancient manuscripts were discovered has been made by modern historiography, and only the general fact is noted that the overwhelming majority of the documents did not become known until the Renaissance after the "Dark Ages". We studied this process in more detail and saw that the appearance of all of the manuscripts occurred in an environment which did not help analyze the finds critically. We illustrate this by a representative example, viz., the story of Tacitus' Histories, which is now one of the most important sources in the history of the emperors of Rome from Tiberius to Vespassianus [245]. The lifetime of Tacitus is regarded traditionally to fall into the period 55-120 A.D. In 1882-1885 and 1878, respectively, two historians, P. Hochart in France and J. Ross in England, published their studies in which they asserted and substantiated that Tacitus' Histories allegedly had been written by the famous Renaissance humanist Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459) [292]. Without discussing here the problem of the authenticity of Tacitus' History (in our opinion, it is an original, has not been falsified, and describes authentic events), we give the survey of this criticism, following [247], and illustrate the atmosphere in which many an antique

document was unearthed. Poggio Bracciolini is one of the most remarkable writers of the 15th-c. Renaissance. He was the author of historical and moralistic books. "On theological problems ... he can speak in a language which everyone could have taken to belong to one of the church fathers, had it been freed of Poggio Bracciolini's signature" (everywhere in the sequel, the italics are due to us-A. F.) ([247), pp. 358-363). He was the author of an archaeological manual for the study of Roman monuments and the well-known History of Florence, a work of the type of Tacitus' Annals ([247], p. 359). "This brilliant imitator was, in the full sense of the word, the master of minds in his century. The critical circles placed him on the level with the outstanding Renaissance authors ... Many found it possible to call the first half of 15th-c. Italian history the 'Poggio age' ...". Florence erected in his lifetime a statute sculptored by Donatello ([247], pp. 358-363). "The prolific way of life cost Poggio Bracciolini much ... and made him always be in need of money. The source of extra aid was his searching, preparing and editing copies of ancient author's manuscripts. It was a very profitable source ... for the 15th c. With the help of the Florentine scientist and publisher ... Niccolo de' Niccoli (1363-1437), ... Poggio Bracciolini organized something like a workshop to deal with ancient literature, and gathered a number of collaborators and counteragents, very educated, but all with a shadowy past ... Their first finds were discovered by Poggio Bracciolini and Bartolomeo di Monte Pulciano in the time of the Council of Constance ... In the lost, humid tower at St. Gall monastery in which a prisoner would not live through three days, they were lucky to find a heap of ancient manuscripts, viz., the work, by Quintilian, Valerius Flaccus, Asconius Pedianus, Nonius Marcellus, Probus and others. This discovery was not only sensational, but also made a literary epoch" ([247], pp. 363-366). Bracciolini "found" fragments "of Petronius" and Calpurnius' Bucolica some time afterwards (ibid.). The circumstances in which all these finds were made were clarified by no one and nowhere. In addition to the originals, Bracciolini also traded in copies which he sold for enormous sums of money. For example, having sold a copy of Livy to Alfonso of Aragon, he bought a villa in Florence (ibid.). "He asked one hundred ducats from the duke D'Estais (1,200 francs) for Jerome's letters, Poggio's clients were Medici, Sforza, D'Estais, aristocratic families of England, the duchy of Burgundy, cardinals Orsini and Colonna, such rich people as Bartolomeo di Bardis, universities which at the time ... either started to found libraries or fervidly extended their old book depositories. The principal copies of Tacitus' "first" and "second " Medicean mss. are kept in Florentine book depositories, among whose directors was Poggio. According to traditional history, these copies are the prototypes of Tacitus' all other ancient manuscripts. The first printed edition was made in 1470 from the "second" Medicean ms. or another manuscript kept in the Venetian Libreria Vecchia at St. Mark's. "It vanished from there, and, possibly, had never been there" ([247], pp. 366-368). "Two Medicean mss. ... supply a complete list of everything preserved from

Tacitus' historical works'' (ibid.).
However, Tacitus' name, as well as the names of other ancient authors, disappeared for many centuries up to the Renaissance (see [245*]-the Russian edition of Tacitus' works, V. 2, p. 203). P. Hochart and J. Ross supply the complete survey of all instances of mentioning "Tacitus" before his work was found by Poggio in the 15th c. It turns out (we omit the details) that all of them, though there are very few, are of general character, and may refer to people having nothing to do with "the historian Tacitus" (247]. Moreover, no information about the existence of the manuscripts of "the historian Tacitus'" was available during the Middle Ages until the 15th c; therefore, whoever the author of Tacitus' works may be, we have to agree with P. Hochart and J. Ross that no one had the slightest idea of Tacitus the historian (until the 15th c.) [247]. "In November 1425, Poggio in Rome informed Niccolo de' Niccoli in Florence that a 'certain monk' ... offered him a number of ancient manuscripts ... , in particular, 'several of Tacitus' works unknown to them' ..." ([247], p. 382). Niccolo de' Niccoli immediately agreed to the deal, but it was to last for many months. "Poggio procrastinated the affair under various pretexts ... Asked by Niccolo de' Niccoli, he gave a rather confused reply from which it was only clear that Tacitus' book was not in his hands at the time ... Poggio was mercilessly lying and inventing excuses, saying that the monk was a friend of his, but, being in Rome, failed to visit Poggio ... , that the books were in Hersfeld, and they had to be received in Nuremberg, etc." (ibid.). "Vexed, Niccoli asked Poggio to give him the catalogue of books 'discovered' by Poggio, and found that it contained no Tacitus" (ibid.). "In this strange train of misunderstandings, which had the appearance of artificality, 1427 and 1428 A.D. passed" (ibid.). Finally, Poggio informed Niccolo de' Niccoli in 1428 that the mysterious monk had again arrived in Rome, but without the book! "For almost five years, Poggio's discovery had been made public before it was made, and strange rumours circulated, which made Niccolo de' Niccoli very agitated, whereas Poggio replied that he did know all the songs sung on his account ... And when Cornelius Tacitus arrived, he would purposely take it and hide it from the stranger's eyes. As P. Hochart notes justly, the most natural guard against ill rumours would seem to show the manuscript to the whole scientific community, explaining all the ways, means and secrets of its origin. On the contrary, Poggio again started his evasive tactics ..." ([247], pp. 374-382). P. Hochart and J. Ross found that "... in a much later edition of his letters to Niccolo de' Niccoli, and omitting the date of his correspondence about Tacitus in 1425-1429, Poggio falsified, for some secret purpose, the dates of December 28, 1427, and June 5, 1428, in two newly publicized letters" (ibid.). Poggio asked Niccolo de' Niccoli to send (!?) him another copy of Tacitus, which allegedly was already in the latters possession. Comparing the dates of correspondence and texts of the letters, P. Hochart stated that this mysterious "second copy" was nothing less than the "first" Medicean ms. (allegedly discovered only many years afterwards). He believed that "... the dates of the letters were falsified post



Frequency Characteristics and Enquete-Codes 115
factum after the appearance of Tacitus, assumingly from Niccoli, in order to confirm the reputation of the "first" ... Medicean ms., which went in use in many nobles' libraries, and pave the way for the second ..." (ibid.). However, it is assumed that both copies were discovered in reverse order. A. Amfiteatrov wrote: "Studying the story of the Codex Mediceus I's origin (discovered later-A. F.) ... we cannot help stressing the fact that the legend surrounding Niccolo de' Niccoli's list 80 years ago repeated again ... Again a Northern monastery is on stage, again some mysterious, unnamed monks. Some German friar brings pope Leo X the first five chapters of the Annals. The pope was delighted, and allegedly detailed the friar to publish the works. The man refuses, saying that he was illiterate. In a word, the legend about the supplier of the "second" Medicean ms. (found first-A.F.), a Hersfeld monk, is revived from the dead ... Legend names ... Arcimboldi ... the intermediary in the deal ... However, Arcimboldi did not mention a word about this circumstance, though Leo X, allegedly through him, paid 500 sequins for the manuscript, i.e., 6,000 francs, a whole fortune for that time. These eternal mysterious monks, incognito, without known origin or place of living, were for P. Hochart the successors of the falsification system launched by Poggio Bracciolini. Nobody has ever seen or known them, but today one of them will carry from Sweden or Denmark a lost decade of Livy, tomorrow another, from ... Fulda, will fetch a copy of Tacitus, etc., always for some reason from the faraway, unattainable North, and always with the same merchandise lusted for by the market of books of the century" ([247], pp. 375-382). The study of the correspondence of Poggio's friends does not make all of these problems clear. Their authors either keep mum regarding the "find" or supply mutually exclusive versions (ibid.). "Beyle said (in the 18th c.-A. F.) that pope Leo X wanted to find the missing chapters ofTacitus so much that he had not only promised money and fame, but also absolution. Is it surprising that they were speedily found? Thus, both of Tacitus' Medicean mss. are equally enigmatic as far as their origin goes. P. Hochart believes, proceeding from the similarity of the obscurity and the legends surrounding, them that they both are of the same origin and belong to the same family: They originated from the Roman workshop of the Florentine Poggio Bracciolini ([247], pp. 374-382). P. Hochart and J. Ross supply numerous data demonstrating Poggio's capability of playing different roles (according to his own books) (ibid.). For Poggio, the Latin language is his mother tongue. "He writes in Latin, and how well he writes! Judging by the suppleness of imitation, it was the Prosper Merimee of the 15th c.... Playing up to the reader's taste, Poggio is Seneca, Petronius or Livy; a chameleon of word and spirit, he can write after anyone's manner ..." ([247], p. 385). The analysis of Tacitus' text shows that this allegedly "ancient Roman" knows the history and geography of the ancient Roman state badly (ibid.). "Gaston Boissier also lists a very large number of contradictions ... Specifying a great many of errors which no Roman belonging to the first century could have made, P. Hochart notes those which reveal in the author a man with 15th-c. outlook and traditions ([247], pp. 387-390). We omit the list of these "faux pas".



116 Enquete-Codes
Moreover, P. Hochart and J. Ross succeeded in finding rather explicit indications which, in their opinion, speak of forgery. "In London, he (Poggio-A. F.) lived, very much deceived in his expectations of Beaufort's generosity ... In 1422 ... Piero Lamberteschi offers him a project of some historical work which has to be done from Greek sources, and kept strictly secret, in a three-year term, during which Poggio will be provided with 500 golden ducats. 'Let him give me six hundred, and it's done!' writes Poggio, entrusting Niccolo de' Niccoli with concluding this little deal. 'The way to pass the time offered by him is very much to my taste, and I hope that we'll create a trick worth of being read'. A month later, he writes: 'If I see that Piero's promises turn from words to business, then I shall be glad to get not only to the Sarmatians, but also to the Scythians for the sake of this job ... Keep secret all the projects I am telling you about. If I go to Hungary, this must be kept in the dark for everyone except several friends', and in June, ... 'be sure that if I am given time ... I will compose a thing with which you will be satisfied ... When I compare myself with the ancients, I again believe in myself. With a good approach, I will not disgrace myself before anyone ... ' Where he was afterwards is unknown. According to Corniani, he did, in fact, live for some purpose in Hungary. According to Tonnelli, he came straight to Florence. We do not know whether his enigmatic deal with Lamberteschi was concluded. Lamberteschi's name vanishes from Poggio's correspondence, which P. Hochart explains by Poggio's being the editor ot his own letters ... But even if the deal had not occurred, then what after-taste would this episode leave? Here it is: Lamberteschi offered Poggio to create some secret historical work. It was assumed to be so secret that Poggio had to work in Hungary; meanwhile, he should have been thought of as still being in England. For this job, he had to study the Greek authors ... He had to compete with the ancient historians, which was what he wanted, and which he was afraid of. And, finally, the whole secret required of him, and accepted by him, shows that the suggested little deal was, though both literary and scientific, not at all a nice one" ([247], p. 393 and further). Lamberteschi was morally right to approach Poggio with such an offer, since the latter had already been caught red-handed once while making a falsification. Several years earlier, Poggio published, with Niccolo de' Niccoli, Asconius Pedianus' Commentarii.
"No one has ever seen the original from which the Commentarii were made, and Niccolo de' Niccoli has also copied from the manuscript sent to him by Poggio from Constanz. The success was enormous, though ... the scientific community immediately understood that something was wrong here. It seemed that Poggio did not pay much attention to covering his fabrication ... The success of the forged Asconius Pedianus made possible a whole series of other fabrications on behalf of the same fantastic author, but they all were too rough, and immediately discovered. Poggio ... was only more cunning than the others. Before starting his Tacitus swindle, he attempted to sell some magnificent copy of Livy to Cosimo de Medici and Leonello D'Estais, and again in a mysterious environment, viz., again a faraway monastery on an island in the North Sea, Swedish monks, etc. The matter hardly concerned the fabrication of the work, but could be, possibly, related to forgery of the manuscript. It is known that Poggio had mastered the Lombardy hand-writing perfectly; and



Frequency Characteristics and Enquete-Codes 117
it was with this handwriting that he enticed princes. But the deal failed here, and the precious copy vanished somewhere without a trace ... It is remarkable that, in this period of his life, Poggio, generally being very prolific, does not write anything signed by his own hand ... But then he learns very much, systematically, in concentrated fashion, possibly training himself for some responsible work related to the Roman history of the emperors' period. Niccolo de' Niccoli hardly has time to send him now Ammianus Marcellinus, then Plutarch or Ptolemy's Geography, etc."([247], p. 394 et seq.). P. Hochart reckons that Poggio started his fabrications alone, but was then forced to involve also Niccolo de' Niccoli (ibid.). They probably first launched into circulation the "second" Medicean ms., and kept the "first" Medicean ms. with the purpose of "flaying the same ox twice"; however, "the market was soon spoiled" by the appearance of a considerable number of discovered falsifications. Poggio did not expose himself to risk for a second time. The "first" Medicean ms. was, probably, issued by his son after he had squandered the whole of his father's fortune (ibid.). Besides the above works, "Poggio-Niccoli, Inc.", circulated the classics such as the complete Quintilian, certain ones of Cicero's philosophical writings and his seven speeches, Lucretius, Petronius, Plautus, Tertullian, certain texts of Marcellinus, Calpurnius Siculus, etc. After "finding" Tacitus, the market got agitated: "In 1455, ... Enoch d'Ascoli found in some Danish monastery (again a monastery, and again in the North-A. F.) Tacitus' Dialogue on Orators, Life of Agricola and Germany, whose language and character are generally known to be considerably different from the Histories and Annals ... The Facetiae ascribed to Tacitus also appeared on the market, and the forgery was not immediately discovered" ([247], pp. 350-351). P. Hochart pointed out the extreme similarity between Poggio's own works and Tacitus' ([247], p. 407). P. Hochart's and J. Ross' works were encountered by the historians with animosity, and caused a scandal. By the way, P. Hochart first became suspicious of Tacitus' text only after he had discovered that the well-known fragment XV, 44, of the Annals (about the Christians) was either a forgery or an insertion (ibid.). P. Hochart's conclusions found the support of certain specialists. For example, A. Drews, while not sharing this assertion about the forgery of the whole work, fully supported P. Hochart in the problem of fragment XV, 44. No concrete objections were given by traditional historians to P. Hochart and J.Ross (as far as it is known to the author). New arguments in favour of P. Hochart's and J. Ross' opinion were supplied by W. Smith ([252], pp. 27, item b, 258). We give the example of Poggio's Tacitus not at all in order to make the reader believe that the ancient documents are all forgeries. Moreover, in the following, we give another and rather unexpected explanation of the whole of the Poggio story, which will assume only a redating of the described events, and not forgery. Certainly, P. Ho chart and J. Ross, loyal to the traditional point of view, and relying on traditional chronology, could not conjure up another explanation for the inconsistences discovered by them like the Tacitus forgery. We believe that to charge one or another document with forgery should not at all be regarded as a means for investigation. Otherwise, an "inconvenient" document



118 Enquete-Codes
could always be charged with falsification, and thereby "eliminate" all related contradictions. In our opinion, there were serious historical reasons for creating each document, among which a purposeful falsification certainly occupies an important, but not at all the first place. Many strange things also happened with respect to the activity of Petrarch, who discovered many an ancient document, e.g., of Cicero [246], [253]; Petrarch was one of the first propagandists of ancient Rome's magnificence. In many cases, he did not exhibit the originals of the ancient texts discovered. He introduced the fashionable style of epistles, in which the contemporary events were brightly framed in antique fashion, using the names now regarded as ancient, etc. Petrarch is the author of many letters addressed by him personally to the heroes of antiquity like Cicero, Livy and others.
1.2. The complete list of Roman emperors of the Second and Third Roman Empires
We now give certain basic, but certainly not each of the "meaningful" parallels arising from the overlapping of the medieval and ancient historical periods indicated on the GCD. For want of space, we illustrate the 300-year rigid shift by the example of Roman history, and exhibit a possible overlapping of the so-called Second and Third Empires; see Fig. 97 in Appendix 1. We call the First Roman Empire the kingdom founded by Romulus and Remus c. 753 B.C., and ending under Tarquinius the Proud c. 509 B.C., whereas we call the Second Empire the kingdom actually founded by Lucius Sulla in 83-82 B.C. and ending under Caracalla in 217 A.D., and the Third Empire the kingdom founded by Lucius Aurelian in 270 A.D. and ending under Theodoric of the Ostrogoths in 526 A.D. The pair of jets with small .X(M, H) is arranged as follows: the jet from the Second Empire almost completely exhausts the whole stream (see below); the Third Empire jet coinciding with the Second Empire jet consists of the most famous emperors of the Third Empire and also possesses a number of unique properties. We give the list of both jets. N. A. Morozov was the first to indicate the possibility of parallelism between the Second and Third Empires. However, he did not investigate the problem of distinguishing these jets from the complete streams, i.e., their representability, and did not arrive at the concept of .X(M, H); therefore, he could not estimate the jet proximity quantitatively. I discovered the optimal jets that differ (in particulars) from those suggested in [13], on the basis of calculating .X(M, H) (Fig. 87), where M and H are some dynasties. An emperor of the Second Empire is placed first, and then that of the Third, associated with the former in the overlapping jets. All the variations of the duration of the rules are given in parentheses, whereas the version involved in the parallel is shown in italics.
In addition to the rule durations, other interesting figures are included, certainly not taken into account in calculating .X(M, H) (if we do take them into account, then .X(M, H) decreases still more).

Since the above list contains other figures in addition to the emperors' rule durations, which are formally unrelated to the calculation of A(M, H) (e.g., the "struggle between Tiberius and Germanicus"), we should restore the original jet made up only of rule durations to compute the coefficient. It was this jet pair that was discovered by the A(M, H) method. It turns out that A(M, H) = 10-12 , which means practically full coincidence of both jets. The total durations of the Empires are different, viz., 299 and 256 years, respectively. Though, compared with the total, the discrepancy of 43 years is small, the fact should be carefully accounted for. It turns out that the Second Empire has not a single "massive" co-rule, comparable with the rule duration itself, whereas the corresponding jet from the Third Empire possesses four "massive" co-rules: pairs (8, 9), (12, 13), (16, 17) and (19, 20). We represent both jets on the time axis by associating each emperor with an interval with ends at the rule's start and finish (see Fig. 110 in Appendix 1). The four "special" pairs (see above) break the jet of the Third Empire into five blocks. What will happen to the graph of the Third Empire jet if we eliminate all the co-rules by moving the associated emperors' pairs apart, and arrange them consecutively and not parallel? We carry out all shifts in one direction through the duration of the corresponding co-rule, without altering anything inside the blocks. It is important that, after this procedure, the jet graphs for the Third and Second Empires on the time axis become almost identical (see Appendix 1, Figs. 110, 111). It is the calculation of the eliminated durations of the co-rules with taking into account the data from No. 29 (see the list) that makes the Second Empire 43 years longer than the Third. Thus, this excess is not only completely absorbed by the four "massive" co-rules, but, having vanished after the above procedure, makes both dynastic jets practically fully coincident on both the uniform scale and the time axis. This leads us to the hypothesis that the above jets are dependent. It is probable that one of the lists is a copy of the other; it is also possible that both were copied from a third "original". We would like to expand on the formal standpoint. We carried out the jet, and not the full stream comparison. The question arises whether the jets possess any objective characteristics distinguishing them from their streams. It turns out that the answer is positive. Second Empire. It is important that its jet nearly completely exhausts the whole of the stream. Only two emperors, Lucius Verus (161-169 A.D.) and Geta (209212 A.D.), were not included.

Note that many emperors from the Third Empire not in the jet ruled only for a short time, about 1-2years; many are known to us only from the coins and many ruled in the provinces such as Gaul, Africa, etc. (We omit the details.) It is important that the jet of the Second Empire is strictly monotonic, i.e., the middle years of the emperors' rules increase strictly monotonically. It is also important that the intervals of the emperors' rules completely cover the whole of the Third Empire in 82 B.C.-217 A.O. The following graphic representation is convenient, where, for each emperor, we can construct an isosceles triangle on the time axis with base on the rule interval,

and the rule duration as height; then the emperor is schematically represented by the vertex, and the dynastic stream can be visually represented on the plane by a broken line joining all the emperors of the jet one by one. The jet of the Third Empire, parallel to the Second Empire, does not exhaust the whole of the former (we will study this "remaining part" in the following); however, it is the "most representative" in the following sense: (1) the trajectory of this jet on the plane (see above) has no self-intersections, which means that the chronological sequence of the emperors in the Second Empire jet mostly coincides with that of the corresponding jet in the Third Empire. Furthermore, the chronological sequences of the rules in the Second and Third Empires jets coincide in 93% of the cases. The only two disruptions occur for two emperors who ruled no longer than two years. But for our excessive scrupulousness and inclusion of these short-term rulers, the monotonicity of the trajectory (jet) would be immediately restored. It is important that, in spite of the disruption, the jet trajectory has no self-intersections. (2) The Third Empire jet parallel, or isomorphic, to the Second Empire, is the basic one in the dynastic stream of the Third Empire. Therefore, the emperors who were not included are co-rulers at least with one of those in the jet. In other words, the jet from the Third Empire, discovered by us, passes through the greatest rulers (with respect to the rules). (3) It is important that the intervals of the emperors' rules for the Third Empire jet completely cover the whole time interval detailed for the Third Empire, which means that, after enumerating all the rulers, the chronicler would embrace the whole history of the Third Empire without omissions, and would represent each year in his description (see Fig. 87), where the rulers are denoted by the vertices of the corresponding triangles which are not represented, and where the thick broken line denotes the Third Empire jet, whereas the dotted lines join the points which are different versions of the same ruler (in accordance with the choice of the beginning of his rule). Furthermore, the Third Empire jet we discovered possesses the optimum property, viz., that any other jet whose trajectory is placed under the one indicated should contain more points. In other words, following this jet, the chronicle would embrace the entire Third Empire, confining itself to the minimal number of rulers. In the following, certain of the Third Empire rulers not in the indicated jet will be "sent" to other parallels. It can be seen in Fig. 87 that the dotted line segments are similarly inclined, which is related to the different versions of the rule duration arising if the starting point varies. We could now end our brief description of the first jet pair, where the jets are close in the sense of the smallness of .X(M, H); however, along with numerical coincidence, there is a striking parallel in the biographies of the Second and Third Empire rulers, overlapping in accordance with the above identification. The "biographical identification" is a new fact completing the formal identification of these jets. We do not assert that one of the empires is the "original" one, whereas the other one is a "copy"; for the present, we do not ask the question "what actually happened"; our goal is merely to note and systematize the available identifications of numerical data, and, as it turns out, also of the related legends. The organization of this entire set



124 Enquete-Codes
of new chronological data into some noncontradictory scheme, taking into account and explaining all the identifications, is complicated. The problem was solved by the author within the GCD framework.
Since the "biographical parallels" only complete a more essential, numerical parallel (see above), we restrict ourselves to a brief indication of certain ones of the biographical identifications. Recall that these "biographies" are due to different chroniclers; therefore, they are sometimes different as to tinging the ruler's activity, and the most striking in this chain of coincidences of the bare facts is that they all arise after consecutively and formally comparing the rulers with the same ordinal numbers in the interval of c. 300 years.
We only deal with the surviving legends, and not with the biographies of authentic rulers; therefore, in the sequel, we will almost always understand by a "biography" only the set of facts that was ascribed by the chronicler to some particular historical figure, not at all assuming that this is in any way exact.
(1) Both jets in the Second and the Third Empires that we discovered, start with great political figures possessing names (e.g.,= Lucius), and similar honorary titles not applicable to anybody else (Restitutor Urbis, Restitutor Orbis).
(2) Both jets end with political figures committing rather similar actions, e.g., giving civil rights to all of the free population, etc.
(3) In both jets, the co-rules practically coincide. The officially collective co-rules like triumvirates tetrarchies, etc., overlap.
(4) There is a consecutive (through c. 300 years) "biographical parallel", which sometimes becomes a striking identity (see below).
It is important to bear in mind that all ancient rulers' names had meaning, such as "powerful" or "staunch". They were therefore not names as we understand the term today, but rather just nicknames, and the same ruler could have different nicknames in different places where different languages were spoken.

28.3. Quite successful professional army commander. In spite of large number of enemies, cleverly defended empire [124]
28.4. Revealed extreme cunning due to generally unstable situation of empire; in particular, ingratiated himself with lower classes: dispensed food, restricted power of ruling class over slaves, etc. ([128], p. 789; [134], p. 325)

She, in turn, was under influence of Aetius, Barbarian by birth [124], official custodian ofValentinian III ([128], p. 757). Unique ruler of empire. Theodosius II, his co-ruler in East, figure oflittle importance, had no influence on empire's policy [124], ([124*], p. 35)
28.2. Turbulent rule in military respect. Repeated intrusions by Barbarians [128]

We now come to the final phase of the parallel. In both empires, hard years of confusion start simultaneously. In the Third Empire, we mostly follow the events in the West. Starting with Theodosius II, the ties between East and West grow weak.

Here end the dynastic streams of the Second and Third Empires. It is striking that the parallel continues still further, viz., the periods 217-235 and 526-536 A.O. are also parallel.
We illustrate this with the following examples.
l. Second Empire ended its existence amid fires, wars and anarchy, 217270 A.D., traditionally called "political anarchy in mid-3rd c.", "soldier emperors" ([134], p. 406)
2. Great anarchy, unique in global Second Empire's history
3. Power seized by Julia Maesa in 217 A.O. after short rule by freedman Macrinus(?) ([134], p. 404406). The names "Amalasuntha" and "Maesa Julia" are probably close: Freed of vowels, they sound MLSNTH and MSJL 4. Julia Maesa was Caracalla's relative (ibid.)
5. Her daughter Mamaea was nearby, in "supporting role". Two women 6. Julia Maesa well-known in Roman Empire's history: only she and Amalasuntha ascended as emperors to throne
7. Julia Maesa's elder son Varius Avitus Bassianus (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) Heliogabalus was Roman emperor (ibid.)
8. Heliogabalus completely dominated by Julia Maesa (ibid.)
l. Third Empire ended its existence in West amid fires, wars and anarchy, 526-652 A.D., traditionally called "political anarchy in mid-6th c., time of Eastern Goths' rule in Italy" [146]
2. Great anarchy, unique in global Third Empire's history 3. Power seized by Amalasuntha after Theodoric's (Caracalla's analogue) death [146], ([146*], pp. 498-499)

14. War in East with Constantinople and "Persians" at end of Amalasuntha's rule. Start of Gothic war in 6th c. (ibid.)
We have compared the periods of 217-234 A.D. at the end of the Second Empire and of 526-535 A.D. at the end of the Third Empire in the West. The parallel continues still further; however, the investigation is made complicated by the fact that the two periods of the hardest civil wars are subjected to comparison, and that their history is extremely intricate and incomplete. It turns out that the periods of 235-270 and 535-695 A.D. are also related by a parallel (with the years 535-695 A.D. strongly compressed), which in the following makes up the subject matter of a special study. It is important that, reaching 270 A.D., we came just to the start of the Third Empire. It was with 270 A.D. that we began the parallel between the Second and Third Empires. Thus, we completely exhausted the whole time interval from the beginning of the Second until the start of the Third Empire. The period 240-270 A.D.,which separates the Second Empire from the Third, is regarded as that of political anarchy reaching its peak: "... until Claudius II came to power (in 268 A.D.-A. F.), there had existed no united Empire ..." ([134], p. 410). Thus, 270 A.D. chosen by us as the year of the Third Empire's start was, in fact, that of the "Empire's restoration" after its alleged complete dissolution (Appendix, Fig. 97).
2. Charlemagne's Empire and The Byzantine Empire. The 330-year Rigid Shift. Comparison of the 4-6th cc. A.D. and the 7-9th cc. A.D.
The manifestation of the c. 333-year rigid shift is a good example of the overlapping of the block II on the line C2 (Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne) and that on E (Eastern Roman Empire in the 4-6th cc. A.D.). We now continue listing the parallels (isomorphisms) which we discovered in an



Charlemagne's Empire and the Byzantine Empire 145
cient dynasties. One of the strongest is the overlapping of Charlemagne's Empire from Pepin of Heristal to Charles the Fat, or 681-887 A.D., and the initial interval of the Byzantine stream in 333-527 A.D. According to Ch. Bemont and G. Monod, Pepin of Heristal started the Carolingian dynasty [124). He ruled in 681-714 A.D. (ibid.). Charlemagne's Empire ended in 887 A.D. when Charles the Fat was overthrown. The year is officially regarded as the start of the empire's dissolution (ibid.). Charlemagne's Empire is usually considered to have started with 768 A.D., the first year of Charlemagne's rule, but, since the Carolingian dynasty was originated by Pepin Heristal (681-714 A.D.) (see above), the three previous rulers, Pepin Heristal (681-714 A.D.), Charles Martel (721-741 A.D.) and Pepin the Short (751-768 A.D) are also included [251] in Charlemagne's Empire. The numerical isomorphism is of the following form (we also indicate certain "biographical" parallels):
la. Pepin of Heristal
1.1. Ruled for 33 years in 681-714 A.D. [124], "age" of Jesus at Crucifixion
1.2. Translation of name: "Seed, God, Heresy" can be understood as "God sowing heresy"
1.3. Sole ruler of 3 Frankish kingdoms, so-called Mayor of palace (ibid.)
2a. Charles Martel
2.1. Ruled for 20 years in 721-741 A.D. [124]
lb. Basil the Great
1.1. "Ruled" for35yearsfrom333 ("king's birth") to 368 A.D. (No Crucifixion?)
1.2. Founder of new religion, "heresy" from standpoint of prior cult, due to isomorphism of legends of Great King(= Jesus?)
1.3. Titled Great King. Arius (325
361 A.D.) + Constantius II (337361 A.D.) ruling for 31 years could be possibly taken instead. Since both were contemporaries, choice is unimportant

3.3. Chronicles exceptionally attentive to religious reform. Pope Stephen II, head ofWestern church hierarchy, extremely influential. This pair is unique in Carolingian history. Pepin promised to obey pope (ibid.)

4.1. Ruled for 46 years in 768-814 A.D. [124)
4.2. Greatest Carolingian ruler. No reign since Theodosius the Great so brilliant and so embodying idea ofempire. Often written as Carolus, or simply "king". Charlemagne = Great King

3b. Arcadius
3.1. Ruled for 13 years in 395-408 A.D. (see above)
3.2. Described both in God-contending (Israeli) and God-praising (Judaic) chronicles as Joash God-contending and Jehoran God-praising (the Bible)
3.3. Chronicles exceptionally attentive to great prophet John Chrisostom and his enormous influence on Arcadius' entire policy during his rise c. 400 A.O. (see above). This pair is unique in Eastern Empire's history of 4-7th cc. A.O.
4b. Theodosius II
4.1. Ruled for 42 years in 408-450 A.D. (see above)
4.2. Rather mediocre ruler. In spite of long rule, strangely few particulars. Theodosius I, officially titled the Great (as well as Charlemagne) and who ruled 13 years earlier, should be mentioned. Bulk of documents describing Theodosius' I rule possibly ascribed to Charlemagne and Theodosius I the Great 4.3. Proclaimed Roman emperor (ibid.) 4.3. "Romaic" emperor

coincidence ofnames "Charlemagne" and "Constantine" by dynastic parallel, identification not accidental (see below)
We will speak in more detail about the "Constantines" in the history of the Roman Empire. In particular, we shall also come back to the overlapping of Charlemagne and Constantine.
5.4. Donation ofCharlemagne to pope in 774 A.D. consisting of all of central Italy, Corsica, Venice, !stria and Benevento [124]
5.5. Unique Donation in Carolingian history
5.6. Text and document itself regarded as lost (ibid.)
5.4. Donation of Constantine allegedly consisting of all of Western Empire and Rome [124]
5.5. Unique Donation in Roman Empire 3rd-7th-c. history
5.6. Text of Donation of Constantine
preserved. Appeared first (!) just under Charlemagne (as regarded traditionally) [124]. Pope under Charlemagne repeatedly referred to Donation ofConstantine as basis for possessing above geographic regions (ibid.)
Thus, the Donation of Charlemagne is regarded as irretrievably lost, but then we have the preserved Donation of Constantine appearing strangely enough just under Charlemagne. The pope, Charlemagne's contemporary, referred to the Donation of Constantine, having signed the Donation of Charlemagne five years earlier. Both "Donations" state almost the same. In our opinion, the "Donation of Charlemagne" and "Donation of Constantine I" represent the same document, which, by the way, has been preserved.
5.7. Loss of text regarded by modern historians as proof of this document's nonexistence as described by Charlemagne's biographers (ibid.)
5.8. Vague indications that "Donation" was made by Pepin (believed to be Pepin the Short, but who possibly was Pepin of Heristal). Existence of this "Donation" regarded as

5.9. Acceptance by Charlemagne of title imperator augustus. Also called excellentissimus, serenissimus and piissimus, titles recalling 6th c., and indicating Christian nature of Holy Empire. Somewhat antique luxury in Barbarian ruler's court (ibid.)

7a. Lothair, Western emperor. Ruled for 15 years in 840-855 A.D. ([74], Table 21)
Sa. Charles the Bald. Ruled for 35 years in 840-875 A.D. Lothair's brother, started co-rule with him in 840 A.O. 85, and ended in 855 A.O. Died in 877 A.D. ([74], Table 21; [124])
9a. Louis the German. Ruled for 32 years m 843-875 A.D. ([74], Table 21)
10a. Louis II emperor of Western Holy Roman Empire. Ruled for 20 years in 855-875 A.D. ([74], Table 21; [124])
lla. Charles the Fat. Ruled for 7 years in 880-887 A.D. (year ofhis overthrow) or 880-888 A.D. (year of his death) ([74], Table 21; [124])

5.9. Constantine I, certainly, "augustus". Famous Octavian Augustus is his analogue in 2nd Empire. Ruling in 4th c. A.D., Constantine the Great allegedly was Christian emperor, possibly orthodox or Arian

7b. Zeno. Ruled for 17 years in 474491 A.D. (ibid.)
Sb. Theodoric. Ruled for 33 years in 493-526 (ibid.)
9b. Anastasius. Ruled for 27 years in 491-518 A.D. (ibid.)
10b. Odoacer. Ruled for 17 years in 476-493 A.O. (ibid.)

Chronological "Cut"
12a. Carolingian Empire's dissolution [124]
149
12b. Western Roman Empire's dissolution. War between Western and Eastern Empires. Death ofTheodoric in 526 A.D. Anarchy in empire
Calculations show that >.(M, H) = 8.25 x 10- 9 for the whole stream from Pepin of Heristal to Charles the Fat. Besides the isomorphism, it is interesting to see how these two streams overlap on the time scale, for which we let the start of Charlemagne's rule in 768 A.D. (it was Charlemagne who "culminated" in the Empire) coincide with that of his analogue, Theodosius II, in 408 A.D., or, which is the same, the reigns of Carloman, "Charlemagne", and Constantine III (see Figs. 43, 44, Table 4). We see that both streams are well consistent.
3. Chronological "Cut" in the Traditional Version of Ancient History
I discovered the chronological cut in the global analysis of the chronology of the Mediterranean, Europe and Asia, taking into account the listed isomorphisms. Making use of [74] (to obtain the result, any sufficiently complete chronological tables are suitable), we succeeded in constructing a complete chronological diagram for all the kingdoms with preserved historical data. These tables are more convenient, since the 19th-c. chronological data are closer to the original conception dating from the 15-16 th cc.; therefore, analyzing [74], we investigate "rawer" material than that of the modern, "brushed-up" tables. All the kingdoms listed in [74] were divided into two groups: those possessing their own annual chronicles, and those whose data are known only from the documents of the first class. Especially much attention was paid to various ancient and medieval chronologies, eras, etc., because they form the chronological skeleton of the history (Fig. 88). It is important that the basic systems of chronology were not at all continuous: from the viewpoint of traditional chronology they had frequently been "forgotten" (sometimes for centuries) and were then "reintroduced" in the same shape.
1) In the basic eras, dating based on the Olympiads allegedly started in 776 B.C. ([74), Table 1). They were first introduced by Dactyl in 1453 B.C., forgotten and then assumingly reintroduced by Hercules in 1222 B.C.; they were forgotten again, and again reintroduced by Iphitus and Lycurgus in 884 B.C. However, they were used in chronology starting only with 776 B.C. The other games, e.g., the Isthmian, Nemean or Pythian games, were also forgotten and reintroduced many times. The year count by Olympiads stopped c. A.D. 1, lasting for about 776 years. The chronologists diverge by 500 years in their estimation of the year from which the Olympiads had been used in chronology. J. Blair asserts that it started at approximately the same time as the count since the foundation of the City (Rome?), traditionally believed to be the mid-8th c. B.C., whereas S. Lur'e claims that, in the epoch of Xenophon, i.e., 5-6th cc. B.C., the chronology based on the Olympiads

Chronological "Cut" 151
was not yet in use; it was first employed by the Sicilian historian Timaeus c. 264 B.C. ((142], p.224). According to S. Lur'e, Timaeus first introduced this chronology 512 years after the first Olympic games, now referred to as being 776 B.C. Thus, each time a counting of years with respect to Olympiads is encountered in a source, we should specify from exactly which date the author proceeds. According to which reference point is chosen, a date oscillation of not less than 500 years is possible even within the framework of tradition. It is important that there exists no correct substantiation of a reference from the Olympic count to that since the birth of Christ. Meanwhile, it was conjectured in [13] that counting of the years of the Olympiads (or 4-year period) was equivalent to the Julian calendar, with its leap-year system, which started not earlier than the 1st c. B.C.
2) Furthemore, counting the years since the foundation of the City (Rome?) started, as is normally assumed, in 753 B.C. ((74], Table 5). This was established by Varro assumingly in the 1st c. A.D. This way of counting off years ended in the 3rd c. A.D., viz., in 250-260 A.D., the period of civil wars in Rome and Italy. J. Blair asserts that most chronicles stop counting years since the foundation of Rome at that time ((74], Table 15). The identification of the City with Rome in Italy is not unambiguous, and admits the identification of New Rome on the Bosphorus, founded c. 300 A.D., and consecrated in 330 A.D. (ibid.). It is important that counting years since the foundation of the City stops precisely at the boundary between the Second and the Third Roman Empires, while overlapping the former and not being extended to the latter. Recall that the statistical dependences were discovered between the chronological data concerning them. 3) Further, the counting of years since the birth of Christ first came into use in 742 A.D., 700 years after the 1st c. A.D., and 200 years after the first calculations of Dionysius Exiguus {6th c. A.D.), who assumingly established more or less precisely the year of Jesus' death. Besides, having been first mentioned in an official document dating from 742 A.D., referring to years A.D. went out of use again, and started being employed from time to time only in the 10th c. A.D. "It is only with 1431 A.D. (i.e., the 15th c.-A. F.) that the use of the term "Christian era" regularly started to be used in popes' epistles, though along with counting years since the 'Creation of the World'" ([88], p.52). However, the term "Christian era" came into use in secular chronicles even later, being established only in the 16th c. in Germany, 16th c. in France, 1700 in Russia and 1752 in England [88]. Thus, we can speak of the regular use of "Christian era" starting only with the 16th c. A.D. The two principal ancient year counts, with respect to Olympiads and since the foundation of the City, stopped (as a minimum) 500 years before the first and unique official mention of "Christian era" in a document of742 A.D.
4) Further, the counting of years since the Creation of the World is purely biblical and, hence, completely dependent on the dating of the books of the Old and New Testament. 5) The Arabic year count since the Hejira started in 622 A.D. ((74], Table 19). It is important that all but two kingdoms are divided into two sets: those wholly existent before the start of the first millennium A.D., and those existing afterwards. The interval from 1 to 260 A.D. is intersected only by the Parthian kingdom and the



152 Enquete-Codes
Roman Empire. Reasonably continual information regarding the Parthian dynasties is absent, and can only be restored from documents related to the other kingdoms ((74]); therefore, the Parthian dating cannot serve as a basis for any independent chronological reference. The second kingdom intersecting the interval is the Second Roman Empire, its end from 260 to 270 A.D. coinciding with that of the special interval 1-260 A.D. discovered by us. Moreover, the decade of 260-270, a period of civil wars and anarchy in the empire, is not covered by neither the Olympic count nor that since the foundation of the City, nor a fortiori, since the birth of Christ. The count since the foundation of the City stopped in 250-260 A.D., whereas the Olympic count stopped 250 years before (according to traditional chronology). The Christian count had not yet started and had not even invented, there being hundreds of years before its use. The statistical dependence between the chronological data regarding the Roman Empire in the lst-3rd cc. A.D. and the 4-6th cc. A.D. was yet to be discovered. Hence, the Roman period of 1-260 A.D. is not independent and does depend chronologically on 314-536 A.D. (i.e., the Second Roman Empire is isomorphic to the part of the Third Roman Empire). As we have seen earlier, the Second Roman Empire is parallel to a part of the Third Roman Empire (two versions of the same history). Therefore the Roman period of 1-260 A.D. is identified with the Third Empire (270-526 A.D.) (being pushed upwards). Then, the Roman episcopate also partly falls into the period of 1-260. However, the period of the first eight successors of St. Peter (68-141 A.D.) is legendary (see above), while that of 141-314 is not independent either and is isomorphic to 314-536 A.D. So, the first episcopate should be pushed upwards, after which we see that the roughly 300-year-long interval from 30 B.C. to 270 A.D. turns out to be a zone where all the documents are completely silent in the chronological sense (Fig. 88). The period from 30 B.C. to 270 A.D. ends in a chronological gap, too, since the two basic year counts of the time from the foundation of the City, and the Diocletian era which started in 284 A.D. (74), are not adjacent: the gap in between is 20 years. Any count since the birth of Christ is still out of the question. Certainly, new data have appeared, e.g., J. Blair's; his chronology of Egypt is scanty; however, the gap in the lst-3rd cc. is still there.
4. The 1,053-year Second Basic Chronological Shift in European History
4.1. The general structure of the 1,053-year second chronological shift and the 1,800-year third chronological shift
The author has discovered that the "modern textbook" is probably fibred and is divided into the sum of almost identical copies of the same chronicle, shifted with respect to the "original" downward schift by c. 333, 1,053 and 1,778 years (Figs. 65, 66). We now briefly sketch the 1,053-year shift we discovered when comparing the volume functions constructed from annual textual information about the ancient and medieval history of Rome. We took Livy's History of Rome [174) as a text describing ancient history, and the fundamental work by F. Gregorovius (44)



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 153
describing the Middle Ages, each of which we broke into fragments describing only one year. The volume of each fragment was calculated (see the graphs representing the volumes in Fig. 31, Part 1). The correlation of local maxima is seen explicitly. The graphs are smoothed, which indicates the dependence of the texts within the framework of the statistical model formulated and verified above. The dependence is explicit and of the same nature as that of the texts describing the same events. Moreover, we discovered that the two millennium-long intervals in the history of Rome (Europe), viz., 753 B.C.-250 B.C. and 300-1,300 A.D., also overlap, which is confirmed by other independent dating methods; in particular, by the method of dynastic parallels and overlapping of events of the corresponding periods, discovered with the enquete-code method. The comparison of ancient and medieval primary sources and events will be carried
out in accordance with one universal shift formula T = X + 1053, where X are the Julian dates in ancient history, and Tare the Julian dates of medieval history. This
is equivalent to T = X + 300, where T are years A.D., and X are years since the foundation of Rome, traditionally dated as 753 B.C. The comparison reveals surprising and far-reaching parallels overlapping ancient and medieval events under the 1,053-year rigid shift. Due to the lack of space, we discuss it only briefly and omit the bulky enquete-code tables occupying about 900 pages and the associated numerical treatment of the whole material. Under the 1,053-year upward shift, the foundation of Rome traditionally ascribed to 753 B.C. coincides with 300 A.D.; therefore, in the study of the parallel, we may count the years since the foundation of Rome from 300 A.D. Note that the foundation of Rome was apparently also described in the Old Testament. In fact, Moses (Nm. 11:1-3) founds a town in TBRH (translated as Taberah), which is associated with the foundation of Rome on the Tiber. Besides, New Rome (Constantinople) was founded c. 330 A.D. [44]. We first give a short overview of the structure of the approximately 1,053- and 1,800-year shifts.

In the present section, we only consider the first two columns of the table. The overlapping of regal Rome seven kings and the Roman Empire in the 3rd6th cc. A.D. was first suggested in [13], and substantiated in [18] and [21], due to the application of the dynastic parallel method. This overlapping is represented on the time axis "termwise" under the 1,053-year rigid shift in Fig. 56 (Table 11). The seven kings of Livy turn out to be collective terms for the seven epochs in the history of Rome in the 3rd-6th cc. A.D. Each of them was represented by Livy as the "biographies" of one or two emperors in the 3rd-6th cc. A.D. The total duration ofregal Rome was 244 years [174], whereas that associated with 300-552 A.O. lasted 252 or 246 years if we count from the first year of the rule of Constantine I. This overlapping of numerical dynasties is supported by the independent biographical parallel discovered with the enquete-code method. We give here only a short final table and indicate only the parallel events, almost completely omitting the detailed spelling-out of parallels and the enquete-codes. The table may serve only as a guide for the reader interested in restoring the basic stages of the overlapping. The left column refers to ancient Rome (described mainly by Livy), whereas the right column refers to medieval Rome (described on the basis of [44]); 1,053-year shift.
4.2. The formula of the shift X + 300. Parallels between the First Roman Empire (Regal Rome}, the Third Roman Empire and the Bible. The first 250 years of Roman history
We start with the analysis of the global isomorphism lasting for 1,300 years. Doing so formally, we let Livy's "foundation of the City" coincide with 300 A.D., and see whether this does not lead to a contradiction in comparing the History of Rome and other "ancient" Roman sources with medieval events according to the universal
formula X + 300, where X are years since the "foundation of the City", used by Livy and other authors for the purpose of dating. The "uniformity of comparison" is important in the suggested algorithm. The medieval and ancient chronologies and events are suggested to be compared uni
formly, in accordance with the same formula X + 300, irrespective of the value of X. From the standpoint of the formula, medieval and antique chronologies are regarded as two rigid blocks overlapped with the 1,053-year shift, which causes 300 A.D. to coincide with the classical date of the foundation of Rome, 753 B.C.



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 155
(1) By the formula X +300, the "regal Rome" of Livy, lasting for 244 years [174], overlaps with the Third Western Empire in 300-544 A.D. (2) The seven "kings" of Livy are collective terms for the seven epochs in the history of the Third Empire. Each epoch was represented by Livy as the "biographies" of one or two emperors whose deeds were described, ignoring or being unaware of other rulers. (3) The "biographical" isomorphism is manifest. Here are Livy's seven epochs (see Fig. 56). (1) Romulus Quirinus (300-337 A.D.), his main "representative" being Constantine I. (2) Numa Pompilius (337-380 A.D.), his main "representative" being Basil the Great {Great King). (3) Tullus Hostilius (380-423 A.D.), his main representatives being Valentinian II and Honorius (Theodosius I, his co-ruler, could be taken instead of Valentinian II). (4) Ancus Marcius {423-444 A.D.), his main representative being Aetius.
(5) Tarquinius the Elder (444-476 A.D.), his main representatives being Valentinian II and Ricimer.
(6) Servius Tullius (476-526 A.D.), his main representatives being Odoacer and Theodoric. (7) Tarquinius the Proud (526-552 A.D.), his main representatives being the Gothic dynasty from Amalasuntha to Tejas.
Comparing the above with the numerical data supplied by Livy leads to 3737, 43-43, 32-43, 24-21, 38-32, 44-50, and 25-26. We have A(M, H) = 10-4 , which is minimum for streams of lenght 7. We now compare the total duration of Livy's regal Rome with that of the interval in the Third Empire, 300-552 A.D., which is 252 or 246 years long if we count off the first year of the rule of the first "king-emperor" Constantine I. The values 244 (Livy) and 252 differ by only 3% (with respect to 244). Livy's distinguishing certain of the indicated intervals is unambiguously consistent with the decomposition of the Third Empire into intervals bounded by long confusion periods. If we count how many years are "covered" by the above rulers in 300552 A.D., then we obtain 242 years, whereas Livy supplied the value of 244 years. The consistency is ideal.

In my opinion, Livy placed the Christian legends both of Constantine I and Jesus at the end of Romulus' "biography". We now give a comparison of the legends of the Rape of the Sabines and the capture of the girls of Shiloh (cf. 1.7a and 1.7b).
1.7a (1). Event occurred under Romulus in newly founded Rome, i.e., during foundation of First Empire (regal Rome)
l.7a(2). Few women in Rome. Threat to continuation of race (ibid.)
l.7a(3). Romulus sent ambassadors to neighbouring tribes, asking for their women (ibid.)

1.7b (2). Murder of all women in war. Threat to very existence ofBenjamites (Jgs 21:16-21)
1.7b (3). Meeting of all elders of community to decide what to do for wives for those who remain, and asking for women of other tribes (J gs 21 :16-17)

They carried off as many wives as they needed, snatching them as they danced; then they went their way and returned to their patrimony, rebuilt their cities and settled in them" (Jgs 21:23)
1.7b (7). Women's abduction by Benjamites. Identification of peoples mentioned in Bible by N. A. Morozov in [13] with Mediterranean and European tribes (this location differs from traditional accounts, and is based on different reading of vowel-free terms).

Basil = "birth" of Jesus), we obtainjust 412 A.D. (at end ofTullus epoch according to Livy)
4b. 423-444 A.D. Aetius
4.1. Actual ruler in Western Empire in 423-444 A.D. (see above)
4.2. Power gradually seized by young Valentinian III being in custody of Aetius (see above, [124], [128])



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
4.3. Tarquinius the Elder then became "Roman king" , pushing aside and succeeding Ancus Marcius (ibid.)
4.4. "Barbarian" Tarquinius the Elder came to Rome from another country, whereas Ancus Marcius was Roman (ibid.)
4.5. Tarquinius' wife Tanaquil "of noble birth", much influenced Tarquinius the Elder (ibid.)
4.6. Tanaquil's hunger for power, instigation of Tarquinius the Elder (ibid.)
4.7. Tarquinius' friendship with king (ibid.)
4.8. King's children in Tarquinius' custody (ibid.). Here, the "custodian" and "charge" are interchanged
4.9. Unique "custody" in "regal Rome's" history. No other king characterized in this way
4.10. "Ancus Marcius" ruled for 24 years, which is well consistent with associated biblical data (ibid.). It is felt that Livy knew old biblical version of Third Empire's history better than its more modern and totally secular version
161
4.3. Valentinian III then became, in fact, Roman emperor, pushing aside and succeeding Aetius (see above) 4.4. "Barbarian by origin", Aetius came to Rome from another country, whereas Valentinian III was RoID8;Il. Here, "Roman" and "Barbarian" are interchanged 4.5. Valentinian's mother Placidia, in turn influenced by Aetius, official custodian of Valentinian III
4.6. Placidia characterized by chronicles as "intrigant" [124]. Valentinian III started pushing Aetius aside, probably, not without Placidia's help. Her "noble origin" due to being emperor's mother
4.7. Naturally "close relations" between Valentinian III and Aetius, who was young emperor's custodian 4.8. No one disputed Aetius' right to power until Valentinian III reached 27 years of age, Aetius being Valentinian's custodian (ibid., p. 35)
4.9. Unique "custody" in Third Empire's history. No other emperor characterized in this way for such a long time and with custodian mother 4.10. Aetiusruled for 21 years (see above), though Bible speaks of423-444 A.D. as of "interregnum", and gives him 24 years. (Fig. 89: between Jeroboam II and Menachem)

in wars, and Valentinian III freed himself of burden of being in custody, while Aetius was still alive (ibid.)
4.13. No data about loss of regal power by Ancus Marcius. Tarquinius the Elder received it "peacefully", with "people's consent"
4.13. Valentinian III received all power "peacefully". No sharp turning point in 444 A.D., year of Aetius' loss of influence
4.14. No data about Ancus Marcius' end (ibid.)
4.14. Empowered by the throne, Valentinian III soon killed Aetius in Ravenna (146]
It is strange that Livy should refer the events of the "Romulus" and "Tullus" epochs to Italy, and place them near Italian Rome; on the other hand, certain other chroniclers describing the Third Empire refer the same events to the region of New Rome on the Bosphorus. It is possible that this confusion between the two Romes is due to ascribing certain Italian events to the East (and vice versa).
5a. Tarquinius the Elder 5b. 444-476 A.D. (Valentinian III (444-455 A.D) and Ricimer (456-472 A.D.))

The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
6a. Servius Tullius
6.1. Name "Servius" close to "Severus"
6.2. Characterized by Livy as ratherreasonable, clever and resolute politician [174]. Emperor Geta (209
212 A.D.), Servius' = Septimius Severus' co-ruler. Name "Geta" rather close to "Goth" (or GTH if freed of vowels)
7a. Tarquinius the Proud
163
6b. 476-526 A.D. Odoacer (476-493 A.D.) and Theodoric (493 or 497-526 A.D.)
6.1. Septimius Severns, Odoacer's analogue in Second Empire (see above)
6.2. Both Odoacer and Theodoric wellknown in Third Empire's history as resonable and resolute politicians (see above isomorphisms). Theodoric's Gothic origin
7b. 526-552 A.D. Gothic dynasty
There exists so explicit an isomorphism, very important for Roman and Greek history, between these two epochs that we devote a special section to its investigation (see below).
The question arises what percentage of the text by Livy is devoted to the events which turned out to be isomorphic in the Third Empire's history, or how much information was left by him outside those isomorphisms whose rough skeleton was exhibited above (we omit the details). It is important that Livy's text consists of separate stories devoted to one episode; having told it, Livy almost never repeated
a story. It is easy to estimate the value X = A/B, where A is the volume (e.g., in pages) of those stories which turned out to be isomorphic to the Third Empire's events, and B the total volume of that portion of Livy's History of Rome which was
compared with the Third Empire. We obtain that X = 67%, which means that 67% of Livy's text describing regal Rome turned out to be isomorphic to part of the Third Empire's history. It is possible that some parallels remain undiscovered; we also cannot exclude the possibility that the remaining 33% of the text describe the events not covered by other chronicles which form the basis for the modern idea of the Third Empire.
4.3. War against the Tarquins and the Gothic war. The 1,053-year chronological
shift and the formula X + 300. Comparison of the historical events of the 6th c. B.C. and the 6th c. A.D.
The action of the formula X + 300, which I used to describe the period from 300 to 500 A.D., is successfully extended also to the 6th c. A.D. We present the rough outline of the new isomorphism below.



164
1. War prehistory
la. Servius Tullius
1.1. Last king dying in regal Rome [174]
1.2. Created church rights, established estates and electoral qualification ([174], Bk. 1, 42, 48)
1.3. According to formula X +300, died in 518 A.D. (ibid.)
Enquete-Codes
lb. Theodoric
1.1. Last emperor of Western Third Empire dying in 526 A.D. when Italian anarchy started (see above)
1.2. Very flexible internal policy (see above). Founded kingdom of Ostrogoths, encouraged science and arts, gave foreigners equal rights as Romans, deported peoples (see [44], [146] and engaged in similar activity as Caracalla, Theodoric's analogue in Second Empire) 1.3. Died in 526 A.D. (see above)
To 1.3: The difference of 8 years is precisely that between the duration of regal Rome and the Third Empire (see above).
2a. Tarquins coming to power after Servius Tullius' death. Tullia (and Lucretia)
2.1. Power passed to Servius Tullius' daughter Tullia and her "husband" Tarquinius the Proud ([174], Bk. 1, 48, 49)
2.2. Large group of "Tarquins" around Tullia (Tarquinius the Proud among them) (ibid.)
2.3. Very close names: Tullia and Julia
2.4. Tarquins ruled for 25 years from Servius Tullius' death to fall ofTarquinius the Proud (ibid.)
2.5. Tarquinius the Elder, probably descendant of Tarquinius the Proud, also newcomer to regal Rome (see above and ibid.)
2b. Goths (Amals) coming to power. Amalasuntha (and Matesuentha)
2.1. Power passed toTheodoric'sdaughter Amalasuntha and dynasty of Goths (Amals) (Tarquins' analogue) [109], [44] 2.2. Support of numerous "Goths" for Amalasuntha. Closed clan as well as "Tarquins" (ibid.)
2.3. Due to isomorphism of Second and Third Empires, Amalasuntha overlaps with Julia Maesa (see above)
2.4. Goths ruled for 26 years from Theodoric's death to Goths' defeat in 552 A.D. Very close figures: 25 and 26 years 2.5. Arrival of Goths and of Barbarians (see above). Regarded as strange element in Italy (at least, according to Procopius' description, whose account is used) [109], [44]



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
2.6. "Tarquinius", probable version of Terra Aquilonious, i.e., "Northern Land" [343]
165
2.6. Arrival of Goths from North, from "Northern Land"
To 2.6a: The Latin-Russian Dictionary by I. Kh. Dvoretsky doesn't supply a translation of the term "Tarquinius" (?); the above translation given by us indicates that the "Tarquins", people from the "Northern Land", newcomers, could be associated with the Goths. Livy's last "king", Tarquinius the Proud, is a collective term for the "Gothic dynasty" in 526-552 A.D.
2. 7. Soon expulsion of Tarquins from Rome (see below). Freed of vow
els, "Tarquinius" = TRQN (there is another close name Torquatus, adorned with necklace). Servius' rule before Tarquins. "Tarquins' " clan characterized by term TRQN, which is close to TRNK
2.7. Repressions on Boethius and Symmachus prior to Theodoric's death. Torquatus Severns present in Boethius' name (being his tribal names fixed in Theodoric's epoch and after him in 6th c. A.D.: Severns and TRQT (TRQN?) [124]. Franks' participation in Gothic war in 6th c. A.D.asGoths'allies. Term "Franks" (TRNK) is close to TRQN
Thus, both in the Tarquins' and Gothic wars, the same important term is fixed,
meaning the clan of Rome's enemies: TRQN = TRNK (sometimes, the "Franks"
will be identified with PRS; see below). (Sometimes "F" = "T" = "PH").
2.8. Tulliapassedpowerto "Tarquinius" [174]
2.9. This rule still regarded as "regal", Tarquinius being last king (however, to be exiled soon) (ibid.)
2.8. Amalasuntha (Julia Maesa) passed power to her son (Goth) Amalaric
2.9. This rule still regarded as "regal", Amalasuntha (and Amalaric) having been recognized by Constantinople as legitimate kings; however, Goths were soon expelled ([44], V. 1)
2.10. Lucretia and Tullia. Both women 2.10. Amalasuntha and her sister Matewere Tarquins' "wives", of regal descent (ibid.)
suentha (and also Mamaea, Julia Maesa's daughter), ofregal descent (see Second and Third Empires' isomorphism above)
2.11. Both women's active participation 2.11. Both women's active participation in court life. No other women in court life. No other women mentioned at that time (ibid.) playing any important role in Italy at that time are mentioned ([44], [109])



166
2.12. Lucretia's suicide. Tullia's expulsion (her fate unknown) ([174], Bk. 1:58-59)
Enquete-Codes
2.12. Murder of Amalasunthain 535 A.D. (Julia Maesa was also killed in Second Empire. Matesuentha's alleged murder(?) (ibid.)
Here, Lucretia and Tullia are replaced by Amalasuntha (Julia Maesa) and Matesuentha (Mamaea). However, the motive of murder is present in both pairs.
2.13. Lucretia's alleged rape by Sextus Tarquinius (TRQN) before she died. Lucretia impaled herself on sword out of disgrace (ibid.)
2.14. Lucretia's death (and just this death!) started war with Tarquins. Tarquins' subsequent exile (ibid.)
2. Start of the GTR-war
3a. Start of war. Exile of Tarquins
3.1. As soon as news about Lucretia's death became known in Rome, city rose against Tarquins (whole clan!). Junius Brutus gathered crowds on Forum and incited crowds to strip Tarquinius the Proud of power, exiling him. Start of war. ([174], Bk. 1:59)
3.2. Tarquinius' murder as Lucretia's offender, who started war ([174], Bk. 1:60)
3.3. Tarquinius' flight after exile. His murder by one of his personal enemies in revenge (ibid.)
2.13. Title of "king" passed to Goth
(=TRQN) Theodahad, with Amalasuntha being in power. Theodahad was Amalasuntha's inexorable enemy. Immediately after coming to power, he reciprocated and sent Amalasuntha into exile on island where she was murdered, allegedly on Theodahad's order ([44])
2.14. Amalasuntha's death (and just this death!) started Gothic war, after which Goths were expelled from Rome (ibid.)
3b. Start of war. Expulsion of Goths from Rome 3.1. Receiving news of Amalasuntha's murder, Eastern Empire's ruler Justinian I ordered Roman-Byzantine armies to Italy to expel Goths. Mund attacked Goths on land, whereas Belisarius attacked Sicily with his fleet. Start of war. [44], ([44*], V. 1, p. 319)
3.2. Amalasuntha's "offender" Theodahad, who started war, was murdered one year after Amalasuntha's death ([44*], V. 1, p. 327)
3.3. Escaping for liberty, Theodahad made for Ravenna after Goths' expulsion, and was strangled by a Goth who was his personal enemy (ibid.)



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
3.4. Well-known Lucius Junius Brutus, son of Marcus, and his importance in exile ofking Tarquinius the Proud ([174])
3.5. Name Junius Marcus Brutus Lucius = NS MRC BRT LC if freed of vowels (we take all "blocks" of which this long name is composed)
167
3.4. Well-known Roman, pope John II Mercurius, son ofProectus ofCeleus hill (?), important in expulsion of Goths from Rome in 533-538 A.D. Ruling in 532-535 A.D., he must have played great role in these turbulent times (though I could not find details of his "biography") 3.5. NameJohnMercuriusProectusfrom Celeus = N MRC PRCT CL. ([44*], V. 1, p. 335, comm.(d))
It is possible that there are different versions of the same name, viz., Junius = John, Marcus= Mercury, Brutus = Proectus and Lucius= Celeus.
3.6. Lucius Junius Brutus, son of Marcus: one of most famous Romans in Roman history. Roman literature rich in mentions of him (e.g., ibid.)
3.7. Lucretia called "Roman" by Livy. Her patriotic speech before death (ibid.). Her death started the war
3.8. Junius Brutus' and Valerius' uprise in Rome. Tarquinius' overthrow (ibid.)
3.9. City's savior Brutus was enthusiastically received in camp, but king's children expelled ([174], Bk. 1, 60)
3.10. Receiving news about exile of Tarquins, the king Tarquinius, started for Rome with purpose of suppression (ibid.)
3.6. John II Mercurius, son of Proectus, one of most famous popes. Monuments in his memory still preserved in Rome, with inscriptions, which not every pope can boast (ibid.)
3.7. Amalasuntha's initiation into dynasty of Amals, Goths who were much influenced by Roman culture (in contrast to Gothic kings afterwards). Gothic king Vitiges' destruction of Amals' hereditary rights after Amalasuntha's death ([44*), V. 1, p. 327)
3.8. Byzantine (Romaic) armies' arrival in Italy. Pope John II (Brutus' analogue). Armies commanded by Belisarius (Valerius' analogue) (ibid.)
3.9. Belisarius' armies march on Rome immediately after Gothic king Vitiges' flight. Enthusiastic reception of Greeks as liberators by Romans on December 9, 536 A.D. ([44*], V. 1, p. 329)
3.10. Having learned ofBelisarius' march on Rome, Vitiges also organized his expedition to capital in first days of March, 537 A.D. (ibid., p. 329)



168
3.11. Gate closed on Tarquinius, and exile announced. Battle of Rome (?) to take place: It is improbable that, having heard of his dismissal, Tarquinius would retreat in embarrassement (for he came in order to supress) (ibid.). But Livy tells nothing about Tarquinius' reaction
3.12. Most active participation in "exile" ofTarquins by Roman Valerius, one of most popular political figures of period ([174], Bk. 2, 1)
3.13. Valerius, well-known Roman army commander, headed Roman armies in battles with Tarquins. His life is enshrouded in legends. He became a national hero and "figure no. l" in war with Tarquins after Brutus' death (ibid.)
Enquete-Codes
3.11. Gate closed on Vitiges. Goths started storming Rome but failed. Subsequent siege regarded as one of turning points in Italian history. Goths' defeat in 538 A.D. Fiftynine battles in one year and 9 days, traditionally regarded as start of Goths' fall (ibid.pp. 348-363) 3.12. Belisarius, well-known Roman army commander, took most active participation in expulsion of Goths from Rome and then from Italy (ibid.)
3.13. Belisarius had already destroyed Vandals' throne in Africa in 535 A.D. and was free to liberate Italy. Justinian decided to unite eastern and western territories of empire again. To fulfil this, fate made him a gift of one of greatest army commanders (ibid.)
3.14. Name "Valerius, Volusius' son" = 3.14. Name "Belisarius" = BLSR iffreed VLR VLS if freed of vowels, i.e., ofvowels,whichisveryclosetoVLR made of consonants VLSR. Term VLS, and coincides with VLSR. "son" could appear later in corn- Note that all these sound similariparing names "Valerius" and "Vo- ties arise on making the history of lusius" ascribed to same person ancient and medieval Rome coinci
dent according to formula X +300.
Thus, VLSR = VLSR
3. War with Rome
4a. Tarquins' war with Rome
4.1. Junius Brutus, one of two principal participants in exile of kings (he overlapped earlier with "pope John II" in 6th c. A.D.). Pair: Valerius and Brutus, who commanded Roman armies in war with Tarquins. Name: Junius (John?). Junius Brutus commanded Roman cavalry ([174])
4b. Gothic war with Rome
4.1. Under Belisarius, who was Roman army commander, well-known general John (cruel cavalry commander). He was made popular by capturing Goths' king Vitiges. His "predecessor, pope John" had already been dismissed by that time; therefore, general John "chronologically continued pope John" , replacing him in war history



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
4.2. Brutus was killed in battle with Tarquins. It is possible that "several Johns" were fused into one collective image of "Junius" by Livy (ibid.)
4.3. In war, the Tarquins formed a closely related clan, forming one dynasty (Tarquinius the Proud, Tarquinius Superbus, Tarquinius Collatine, son of Tarquinius the Proud) (ibid.)
4.4. After "exile of kings", Roman consulship. Consuls were elected for one year. This was well-known consulship allegedly current in Rome for centuries until its end in mid6th c. A.D. [39], ([174], Bk. 2, 1)
169
4.2. General John was killed in battle with Goths. Though Procopius described several "Johns", mixing up their description [109], ([109*], p. 273)
4.3. In Gothic war, Gothsformed closely related clan as unique dynasty electing their kings during this short and turbulent period (Vitiges, his nephew, Gothic king from Verona, Totila, Tejas) [44]
4.4. In mid-6th c., Italian consulship ended, which occurred precisely before Livy's Roman consulship, i.e.,
before 544 A.D. = 300 + 244. Year 245 since foundation of Rome was first year of republic and consulship [39], [174]
To 4.4.: The last Roman consul was Decius Theodorus Paulinus in 534 A.D. He was known only for being the last in the long succession of Roman consuls. Thus, by the formula X + 300, Livy's consulship started just where the Western Roman Empire's consulship "ended" according to traditional chronology. At the same time, "consulship traces" are encountered in the traditional history of medieval Rome, just starting with 6th c. A.D. In spite of the tendency of certain historians to forget the Roman consulship after the 6th c. A.D., they are forced to admit that individual consuls were still "encountered", though their lists "were not preserved", with the consuls' lists of republican and regal "ancient" Rome nevertheless being available (note that "ancient" Rome overlaps with the Middle Ages by the formula X + 300).
4.5. According to Livy, in 245 year since foundation of City, or 545 A.D. according to X +300, Valerius, Belisarius' analogue, started as consul. Valerius and Brutus were very first republican consuls. They were also first consuls after "exile of kings". Valerius (and Brutus) started by himself long succession of "ancient consuls" (whose lists are largely preserved) ([174], Bk. 2, 1), [39], ([39*], p. 206)
4.5. After first period of struggle with Goths, Belisarius is called off from Italy to war with Persians, and again appeared in Italy at end of543 or beginning of 544 A.D. Belisarius (see above) was first (or one of first) Roman consul after expulsion of Goths, who started long succession of medieval consul (whose complete lists were not preserved ([44], ([44*],
v. 1, p. 319))



170
4.6. Valerius (Volusius' "son") was consul in 245-247 years since foundation of City (3 years), and then dismissed from consulship (ibid.)
Enquete-Codes
4.6. Belisarius was in Italy again in 544548 A.D. (3to4years). ln548A.D., Belisarius left Italy, called off by Justinian ([44*], V. 1, pp. 401-402)
These two time intervals coincide not only in length but also on the absolute scale
if we apply our formula X + 300. (because 245 + 300 = 545).
4.7. After his dismissal from consulate
in 548 A.O. according to X + 300, Valerius was still alive for some time, and died in 551 A.D. according
to X + 300 (ibid.)
4.7. After his removal from Italy in 548 A.O., Belisarius was alive for some time and died c. 551 A.D., data being legendary [124]
Though the dates of death differ by ten years, which is a small figure in comparison with the intervals under consideration, the previous chronological milestones of their
"biographies" coincide ideally if we apply the same universal formula X + 300.
4.8. In spite of his dismissal from consulate and state affairs in 548 A.D.
(under X + 300), Valerius (Volusius) was again appointed consul for one-year term shortly before his death in 550 A.O. in accordance
with X + 300 (ibid.)
4.9. "Rights restoration" occurred immediately before Valerius' death (being appointed consul) (see above and ibid.)
4.8. In spite of his removal from Italy in 548 A.D. and being charged with high treason (see below), Belisarius was lucky to be aquitted. He was soon released, all his titles restored, and part of his estate regained [44]
4.9. Belisarius was "restored in rights" immediately before his death. He regained part of his assets which he did not manage to lay his hands on, though, because of his death (ibid.)
4.10. Valerius died surrounded by halo of 4.10. Belisarius died surrounded by halo great fame. He was, in everybody's of great fame. His deeds made him opinion, best both at war and in equal to ancient heroes. This charpeace, and enjoyed enormous fame acteristic is unique for 6th c. A.D. (ibid.)
4.11. Great army commander, unique for 4.11. Great army commander, unique in this epoch, died in poverty. Having this epoch, died in poverty, without enjoyed enormous fame, but with being able to make use of returned scanty means, he died without any assets. He died in disgrace and funds for a burial be buried on, and in such oblivion that legend made money was given by state (ibid.) him symbol of inconstancy of human happiness. His assets were confiscated when he was arrested ([44], [124])



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 171
4.12. Profiting from favourable attitude 4.12. During Gothic war, Belisarius was towards him, Valerius not only induced envy after victory over Tarquins, but also was suspected of longing for regal power. He built himself a house on Velia's top, which allegedly was unconquerable fortress. These speeches and popular confidence disturbed Valerius' spirit. Calling citizens to meeting, he ascended tribune and gave a speech, trying to reject charges of attempts to seize power. In particular, can any valour be respected by them so that no suspicion may fall on it? Should he, most cruel enemy of kings, be afraid to be charged with striving for regal powers himself? ([174],Bk.2,7). Icouldn'tfind any other consul charged similarly during entire existence of republic until 1st c. B.C. in Livy
4. Stream of parallel events
charged with high treason. Goths offered him Italian Crown with purpose of "tearing" Belisarius away from J ustinian, and provide themselves with support of Belisarius' corps. In 539 A.D., Belisarius defeated Gothic king Vitiges, and Goths offered him Crown. At end of 539 A.D., before Belisarius sailed from Italy, new Gothic king from Verona sent ambassadors to inform him that he would place purple at Belisarius' feet if he fulfilled promise to declare himself Italian king. Belisarius deceived Goths, and placed Crown at disposal of Justinian. Unwilling to rise against emperor, famed hero calmly went to Byzantine Empire (44]. But the very fact of Belisarius' alleged consent to Italian Crown served as pretext for subsequent arrest and confiscation of his assets [124], ([124*], p. 84)
4.12(1). Great army commander charged 4.12(1). Great army commander charged with high treason and capturing with high treason and capturing throne throne
4.12(2). Probably, charge was based on real circumstances
4.12(3). Valerius was dismissed from consuls, and, judging by Livy's description, fell into disgrace
4.12(4). Tried to refute charges, making public speeches in Rome
4.12(2). Charge was based on real circumstances, viz., Belisarius' consent to Crown during talks with Goths
4.12(3). Belisarius was called from Italy, and arrested on charge of high treason. Subsequently fell into disgrace
4.12(4). Probably, attempted to refute charges in New Rome (no data about process preserved)



172
4.12(5). During "trial of Valerius", anyoody thinking to capture regal powers was declared outlaw and stripped off all possessions [174]. Probably, it was just for this fact that Valerius' assets were confiscated ("died in poverty")
4.12(6). Then consul Valerius offered laws which not only freed him of suspicion of coveting regal powers, but also made affair look different, which gained him popular support. He was appointed consul once more (ibid.)
4.12(7). All these events occurred in 545546 A.D. in accordance with
X + 300 (ibid.), and are well consistent with dates in right column 4.13. War: Tarquins were far from Rome, marched on capital from time to time 4.14. In 543-544 A.D., Tarquinius the Proud sent message to senate ([174], Bk. 2, 3)
4.15. Regal ambassadors from Tarquinius came, only asking for possessions, and making no mention king's return. When their demand was heard in senate, its discussion was going on for several days [174]
4.16. Long discussions. They were afraid that refusal ofpossessions would lead to war, whereas payments might mean support and help to wage war (ibid.)
Enquete-Codes
4.12(5). Belisarius' assets were confiscated (see above). He died in poverty. (We have to make use of those facts from "biographies", of ancient historical figures that were preserved by sources no matter how commonplace they were. Furthermore, remaining information often vanishes, not being preserved until today)
4.12(6). Then Belisarius was pardoned and his former titles returned (see above). He was surrounded by halo of fame
4.12(7). All these events occurred c. 544548 A.D. (in548A.D., Belisarius was called from Italy, charged with high treason (?))
4.13. War: Goths were far Rome, but went on military expeditions to capital from time to time
4.14. In 543 A.D., new Gothic king Totila, sent letter to Roman senate from Naples [44]. Dates are well consistent with left column 4.15. Totila's letter charged Romans with gratitude towards Goths and contained no word about his desire to return to Rome as ruler. Letter had no demands of military nature. In particular, Totila did not demand banishing Romaic Greeks from Rome. Letter was forwarded by captive Romans ([44], [109])
4.16. General John declined to reply. Then Totila sent some more letters of peaceful character (ibid.)



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
4.17. Tarquinius' ambassadors asked for young Romans' help, and covertly made plans of regal power restoration. They held talks in order to secretly let king's family into city at night. Preparation of conspiracy {[174), Bk. 2, 3-4)
173
4.17. Greatly agitated, people read these proclamations everywhere in city. Greek rulers suspected Aryan Roman priests of secret accord with Goths. Conspiracy was probably, also organized with praetor Cethegus (ibid.; see also below)
4.18. Roman nobility's participation in 4.18. conspiracy. However, conspiracy
Roman nobility's participation (including Arian priests and patriwas disclosed, conspirators arrested, brought to court, and executed ([174), Bk. 2, 5)
4.19. Receiving news of conspiracy's failure and execution of conspirators, Tarquinius decided to prepare himself for open war {[174], Bk. 2, 6)
4.20. Livy almost everywhere spoke simply of "Tarquinius", and not of Tarquinius the Proud, while describing war, and combining all Tarquins at once under this term (ibid.)
4.21. Tarquinius started tour of Etruria, "asking" Etruscans to help him to return to throne. Most probably, this implies movement of Tarquinius' armies in conquering Etruria. Livy wrote that the speeches were effective. Tarquinius went on expedition with allies who were following him in his attempt to return kingdom, and pursue Romans in war (ibid.)
4.22. In 544-545 A.D. under X + 300, Tarquinius' armies and their allies approached Rome (ibid.)
cian praetor Cethegus) in conspiracy. However, conspiracy was disclosed, and conspirators expelled from Rome (ibid.)
4.19. After conspiracy failure and conspirators' expulsion, Totila took on expedition to Rome in 543-544 A.D. (ibid.)
4.20. Goths made war in closely united group. Their kings were military commanders rather than kings who lived in some constant residence [109]
4.21. Totila decided at first to overpower several Etrurian cities, and also Picenum and Aemilia. This event was described more truly in "Gothic" version of war than in Livy: Totila did not make tour of Etruria, beseeching help, and captured Etruria, gathering strength for his armies [44], [109]
4.22. Insummer545A.D., Totilacamped near Rome [44]
The coincidence of the date is ideal (under X + 300).
4.23. Battle of Rome started. Tarquins repelled attacking Romans, though Romans defeated Tarquins' allies [174]
4.23. Battle of Rome started. Belisarius retreated from Rome. Goths unruffied. Roman armies preserved by this retreat [44), [109]



174
4. 24. For some obscure reason, Tarquins did not enjoy victory over Romans: Quite unexpectedly, they left Rome. Livy "explained" it as a miracle, narrating that one night a loud voice was heard, saying that victory was in Romans' hands ([174], Bk. 2, 7). Terrified, Tarquins hurriedly left
4.25. After Tarquins' unexpected defeat at dawn, when no enemy was seen, consul Valerius triumphantly returned to Rome (ibid.)
4.26. It occurred in 545 A.O.
(under X + 300) (ibid.)
Enquete-Codes
4.24. For some obscure reason, Goths did not enjoy their victory over Romans: Quite unexpectedly, they left Rome. It is surprising that Totila should not have commanded all his forces to Porto in order to end war, because Belisarius was staying there with his army (ibid.)
4.25. After Goths' unexpected retreat, Belisarius, advancing with all his armies, managed to enter Rome. As soon as great army commander was there, he made himselffamous, and his genius and luck came back to him doubled. Though Goths tried to return, they were immediately beaten off (ibid.)
4.26. It was in spring of 547 A.O. This battle of Rome lasted from 545 to 547 A.O. (ibid.)
The coincidence of dates is ideal (under X + 300).
To 4.24: As we noted, Livy ascribed Valerius' victory to a miracle: Voice of (God) Sylvan made Roman adversary flee in horror (ibid.)
To 4.24: Even in faraway places, everyone was startled, in deepest bewilderment, by failure of Goths near Rome, which was then half open, to successfully resist Belisarius ([44*], p. 398)
4.27. After this first unsuccessful bat- 4.27. After first unsuccessful battle of tle of Rome after Tarquins exile, they asked for king Porsenna's help (= PRSN) ([174], Bk. 2, 9). It
is important that TRQN (= Tarquins) and PRSN (Porsenna) were allies in this war
Rome and expulsion ofGoths, Totila was seeking Franks' help [44]. Recall that Franks could overlap with
"Persians" (= PRS if freed of vow
els) (cf. "Parisians"). It is important that Goths (TRQN's analogue) and Franks (either PRS or TRNK; see above) were allies. Along with Goths, Franks are carriers of term TRNK in 6th-c. war



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
4.28. King Lars Porsenna decided to support Tarquins and took part in their second expedition to Rome. Tarquins' and Porsenna's united armies approached Rome. Senate was frightened of Roman plebs accepting peace proposals ([174], Bk. 2, 9). Let us recall that: Porsenna = Porsena, Porsinna, Porsina (see [343), p. 785)
4.29. Second expedition to Rome, according to Livy, occurred in 546 A.O.
(under X + 300). Meanwhile, Valerius headed Roman armies against Porsenna = Porsena (ibid.)
175
4.28. Procopius did not report whether or not Franks participated in Totila's second expedition to Rome. Moreover, Theodebert allegedly refused to give Totila his daughter. However, several years earlier, Franks' armies did take part in war along with Goths, and Vitiges resorted to Theodebert's help as early as war with Romans. Then Frank Theodebert intruded Italy but retreated after Belisarius' threats (ibid., [109))
4.29. Second expedition to Rome occurred in 548-549 A.O. Belisarius was called from Italy 540-544 A.O. and headed Roman armies against Persians (!)
The agreement of the dates 546 and 548-549 A.O. is close (under X + 300).
4.30. Valerius was at war with Porsenna 4.30. Belisarius was at war with "Perduring second invasion by enemy sians" (= PRS if freed of vowels) on Rome (ibid.) before second invasion of Rome)
The sound analogy is obvious, viz., Porsena = Persians (PRSN = PRSN).
4.31. Porsenna (and Tarquins) laid siege to Rome, but could not take it ([174), Bk. 2, 10)
4.31. Totila conquered part of Rome, except Adrian's castle with Roman guards (ibid.)
4.32. Defending Rome, Horatius Codes 4.32. Especially valiant was brave army was especially valiant (ibid.). Name: commander Cilician Paul in defense Codes= CCLS, which is almost co- of Rome (in particular, of Adrian's incident with CLCC castle; see above) (ibid.) Name: Cilician = CLCC 4.33. Not taking Rome, Porsenna re- 4.33. In 549 A.O., Totilaleft Rome. Thus treated from Roman bounds. Thus ended second battle of Rome (ibid.) ended second battle of Rome ([174), Bk. 2, 13)
4.34. It was last battle of Rome in war 4.34. It was last battle of Rome in Gothic against Tarquins (ibid.) war (ibid., [109))



176
5. End of the GTR-war
5a. End of war with Tarquins
5.1. In 550 A.D. (under X + 300), Valerius was elected consul for last time, and finally left arena of war with Tarquins, dying in 551 A.D.
(under X + 300) [174]
5.2. Lartius became Roman army commander in Italy in 553 A.D. (under
X + 300) instead of Valerius ([174], Bk. 2, 18)
5.3. Name Lartius (= LRT), which is close to NRS
Enquete-Codes
5b. End of Gothic war
5.1. At end of 548 or beginning of 549 A.D., Belisarius was called from Italy, and finally left Gothic war arena [44]. Agreement of dates 550-551 A.D. and 548-549 A.D.
well consistent under X + 300 5.2. Justinian's appointment of Narses, another well-known, but not as brilliant as Belisarius, army commander who ended Gothic war 5.3. Name: Narses (= NRS)
The dates 553 and 551 A.D. are extremely close (under X + 300).
5.4. Lartius was first dictator in "ancient" Rome and invested with full powers (ibid.)
5.5. In 559 A.D. (under X + 300), Tarquins fought Roman armies, now far from Rome, for last time. It was last battle of war with Tarquins. It is important that I have thereby listed ALL battles in this war described by Livy (ibid.)
5.6. Battle was extremely ferocious, and ended in Tarquins' defeat (ibid.)
5.7. King Tarquinius the Proud was wounded and carried to safety by his warriors, and died in Cumae after some time ([174], Bk. 2, 19, 21)
5.8. Son of Tarquinius the Proud also took part in Tarquins' last battle against Romans (ibid.)
5.4. Narses' investment with extraordinary powers, his unlimited dictatorship in Italy [109]
5.5. In 552 A.D., Gothic army headed by Totila fought Romaic Greeks, now far from Rome, for last time. It was last battle in Gothic war. It is important that I have thereby listed ALL battles in this war, described by medieval accounts
5.6. Battle was extremely ferocious, and ended in Goths' defeat [109]
5. 7. While fleeing, king Totila was heavily wounded, and died after some time ([44], [44*], V. 1, pp. 407-408)
5.8. In last battle of Goths with Romans after Totila's death, young Tejas became king for short time, defeated in 553 A.D., i.e., almost immediately after Totila's defeat (ibid.)



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
5.9. After defeat, Tarquins vanish from Italian political stage, and completely from "ancient" (republican) Roman history. Livy stopped mentioning them after report of complete defeat. It remained unknown where they went after battle
177
5.9. After defeat, Goths vanished from Italian political stage. It remained unknown where they left for from battlefield (ibid.)
Thus, in most cases, we observe a striking coincidence of the right and left dates and events under the action of the suggested formula X +300, which is a consequence of the results obtained by means of computing ,\( M, H) (see above). The divergence of two or three years (rarely reaching 10 years; see above) can be explained by Livy, who said (Bk. 2., 21) that chronological inaccuracy baffled the researcher, since different people distributed the magistrates differently, which have occurred in such ancient times that one cannot make out the succession of consuls or what happened when. This is, probably, a 13-15th cc. A.D. text.
The coefficient X = A/B (see above) equals 74% for part of Livy's text, describing
the war with the Tarquins, i.e., 74% (!) is exhausted by the isomorphism exhibited above. I discovered that this war was also described in other well-known sources (e.g., the Trojan war; the isomorphism plays the most important role in studying GrecoRoman chronology).
As can be gathered from the GCD (see above), this is an isomorphism encountered most often: Many well-known wars in "ancient" history are duplicates of this medieval one. However, the GTR-war is not at all the original of all these "reflections", itself appearing in the 6th c. A.D. due to the same chronological shifts. The original of the Trojan-Gothic-Tarquins, etc., wars listed in the GCD occurred probably in the 13th c. A.D. (in Italy and Constantinople). In the following, we devote a special section to this most important circumstance.
4.4. The Second Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire in the 10-13th
cc. A.D. The 1,053-year chronological shift and the formula X + 300
1. Ancient Rome and medieval Rome in 555-850 A.D. Above, we have demonstrated
the action (in 300-553 A.D. = 250 years long time interval) of the important chrono
logical shift formula T = X + 300 years (which is equivalent to the 1,053-year shift). It turns out that the discovered parallel can be extended further through the 79th cc. A.D. We only give a brief summary.
Ancient Rome in 500-200 B.C.

Roman-German Empire in 10-13th cc. A.D. Sb. Total duration of Holy Roman Empire from 962 (or 964) A.D. to 1254 A.D. is 292 years
The numbers 292 and 299 are quite close
9a. Second Empire is localized in Italy
10a. Start of Second Empire in 971 A.D.
under X +300 (counting from foun
dation of City: 971 = 671 + 300
years), which is very close to 962 and 965 A.D. lla. First emperor of Second Empire as well as first emperor of Third Empire was titled Restitutor
12a. Second Empire fell in 1270 A.D.
(according to X + 300). End of Caracalla's rule in 217 A.D., which is close to 1250-1256 A.D.
9b. Empire in 10-13th cc. A.D. is also localized in Italy 10b. Empire in 10-13th cc. A.D. started either in 962 A.D. (coronation of Otto I in Rome) or 965 A.D. (when Otto I conquered Italy) [124)
llb. First emperor in 10-13th cc. A.D. "restored" Roman Empire, as written by medieval chronicles (ibid.)
12b. Empire fell between 1252 (or 1254) and 1256 A.D., 1254 A.D. being its official "end" (ibid.)
2. John the Baptist and John Crescentius (10th c. A.D.). We now come to the comparison of enquete-codes ("biographies") pertaining to the end of the 10th and the beginning of the 11th c. A.D. with their duplicates, from the 1st c. B.C. to the 1st c. A.D. It is possible that part of the Gospel, speaking of Jesus, reproduces important
events of the 11th c. A.D. The formula X + 300 makes the era of Jesus overlapping with that of Gregory VII Hildebrand. According to the Gospel, John the Baptist had prophesied ("a new era") and died a martyr prior to Jesus. It is probable that the legend was also "lowered" to the beginning of the Christian era from the
10th c. A.D. The formula X + 300 causes the epoch of John the Baptist to overlap with that of John Crescentius. The isomorphism is roughly as follows, viz., John the
Baptist = John Crescentius, well-known political Roman figure in the 10th c. A.D.;



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 179
king Herod = emperor Otto III; ruler Philip (Herod's brother) = pope Bruno, reli
gious Roman ruler, Otto's (Herod's) cousin; Herodias = (possibly) Stefania.
John the Baptist
la. Name: John
John Crescentius (10th c. A.D.)
lb. Name: John Crescentius
The name parallel is obvious. It is interesting that in orthodox (in particular, Russian) tradition the name "John the Baptist" sounds as "John Crestitel'". The name "Crestitel" is based on the word "cross".
2a. Well-known prophet, struggling against king Herod and his family clan (Herod and Philip)
2b. John Crescentius hero of secular Rome, fighting against foreign power, and leading national party
To 2b: Around 960 A.O., the National Roman Party was founded in Rome by John Crescentius, a "prominent Roman.... For several years, John Crescentius was indeed the ruler of Rome ... as head of the National Party" ([44*], V. 3, pp. 325326). He was the most famous representative of the Crescentius family in Rome in medieval times. He was the "holy ruler of Rome, but not an independent sovereign" ([44*], V. 3, pp. 326-327).
3a. Leader of religious movement (before Christ)
4a. Well-known monk. Prophesied "in the whole Jordan valley" (Mt 3:5)
5a. King Herod was John's principal opponent
6a. King Herod was authentic figure. John the Baptist, demonstrating his religious independence, submitted himself to Herod's secular rule
7a. Originally neutral relationship between John the Baptist and Herod
3b. Overthrew pope John XV and led church power in Rome [44]
4b. Allegedly took orders in 972 or 981 A.D. (ibid.). According to previous identifications, Italy may be "Jordan valley"
5b. Emperor Otto III was Crescentius' principal opponent
6b. Emperor Otto III was crowned by Roman emperor in 996 A.D., which put end to Crescentius' rule as patrician (ibid.)
7b. Originally neutral relationship between John Crescentius and Otto III (ibid.)
To 5b: In the absence of Otto III (983-1002) who was away from Rome, John Crescentius was the ruler of Rome in 985 A.D. He formally recognized the rule of the German throne (in the person of Otto III) ([44*], V. 3, p. 328). Otto III was in Rome in the year 981. After the death of the empress Theophano in 991, John Crescentius "finally took control of the city in his own hands" ([44*], V. 3, p. 342). Otto III attacked Rome in 996 and conquered it. The Romans were vanquished. Crescentius remained the leader of his party, but not the independent ruler.



180 Enquete-Codes
To 6b: "After 13 years, during which nobody was invested with the title Emperor, Rome once again saw the New August within its walls" ([44*], V. 3, p. 346). To 7b: Otto III made his cousin Bruno pope.
8a. Philip was of regal descent 8b. Bruno was of regal descent (grandson of Otto I the Great) [44]
Both represent two family clans opposing John the Baptist.
9a. Negative attitude ofGospel towards king Herod, Philip, and on the contrary, favourable treatment of John the Baptist
10a. John's arrest and imprisonment by king Herod
9b. Inimical attitude ofRoman national party to Germans Otto III and Bruno. In contrast, Crescentius was Roman national hero
10b. Crescentius' arrest and trial (sentenced to exile) by Otto's order [44]
To 9b: "Both the Pope and the Emperor were relatives and both were of German origin ... The Romans were not disposed amicably towards these blond saxons who had come to rule over their city and also the christian world. The young aliens could not command a reverential attitude towards themselves" ([44*], V. 3, p. 346).
To 10b: "After the appointment of the Pope (Bruno-A. F.) who was of royal origin, it was necessary to tame the city ... Mutinous Romans who had expelled John XV were put on trial ... Some of the popular leaders (of the mutiny-A. F.) including Crescentius were sent to exile" ([44*], V. 3, p. 347).
lla. "Amnesty" of John the Baptist, declared by Herod (and Philip). Though John the Baptist was imprisoned, he was not executed, but, on the contrary, enjoyed Herod's support (Mk 6:24-28)
llb. "Official amnesty" declared by Otto III (and Bruno) for Crescentius, who stayed in Rome, but was dismissed from politics (analogue of "house arrest") [44]
To llb: "Not used to power, ... Gregory V (born as Bruno-A. F.) wanted to conquer Rome by his goodwill, and requested the young emperor, who was also amicably disposed, to rescind these orders. Crescentius swore allegiance and continued to live in Rome as a private citizen" ([44*], V. 3, p. 347).
12a. "Offence" against Philip and Hero- 12b. "Offence" against pope Bruno by ,} dias by John the Baptist Crescentius. Expulsion of Bruno from Rome by John [44] 1
--------------------------=---=-------i
To 12b: The expulsion by John Crescentius of Bruno, the personal appointed ofl•
Otto III and Otto's cousin, was indeed an obvious "affront" to the entire Otto-Bruno f
clw. I



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
13a. Herodias' daughter took part in events. Herodias was Herod's wife (Mk 6:17-22). Herodias' daughter "infatuated" king Herod with her dancing
181
13b. Stefania was John Crescentius' wife and Otto's (Herod's?) mistress [44]. Stefania "infatuated" Otto III
To 13b: According to medieval chronicles, Stefania (after the death of Crescentius) was given away "as a booty" to the mercenaries. "But this narrative is purely a fabrication provoked by the national hatred of the Romans, and there exists another quite different legend according to which Stefania is portrayed in the fabulous role of the beloved of the conqueror of John (i.e., Otto III-A.F.)" ([44*], V. 3, pp. 358359). "It was stated that the new Medea in the person of Crescentius' widow (i.e., Stefania-A. F.) entangled Otto III in her charms ..." ([44*], V. 3, p. 104).
14a. Catastrophic turn ofevents for John. 14b. Catastrophe: uprise in Rome, headed Demand of John's execution by Crescentius [44]
To 14b: "Having established his tribunal in the eternal city and pacified the Romans by declaring amnesty, Otto III ... returned to Germany ... However, the departure of Otto soon served as a signal for Romans to rise in revolt, and the National party again made a desperate attempt to overthrow the German yoke. Crescentius hatched a conspiracy to overthrow the German pope and his cronies. Discontent was rife among the masses: aliens who were ignorant of the Roman law dispensed justice and appointed judges who were not paid by the state and were therefore corrupt and biased ... The mutiny took place and the Pope fled on September 29, 996 ... The brave mutineer (John Crescentius-A. F.) hurried ... to establish his rule in Rome ... After the Pope's flight, a total revolution occurred in the administration of Rome ... Crescentius again declared himself as a patrician and the Consul of Romans" ([44*], V. 3, pp. 348, 351-352). In 998, Otto approached Rome with his army, and the city capitulated, except for the St. Angels castle where Crescentius and his allies took refuge, "vowing to fight till the last drop of blood ... Otto demanded that Crescentius lay down his arms" ([44*], V. 3, p. 355). Having received an insolent reply, Otto soon laid a siege to the castle and captured it on April 29, 998.
15a. John's execution by Herod's order. John's beheading often used as important theme in iconography, painting, etc
16a. John the Baptist famous Christian martyr
15b. Crescentius' execution by Otto's order. John's beheading often used as important theme of medieval legends and chronicles in 10th c. A.D. 16b. John Crescentius famous Roman martyr [44]
To 15b: "Crescentius was beheaded, cast down and then hanged ... According to the Italian historians, Crescentius' eyes were torn out, his limbs were broken and he was dragged on a cow's skin through the streets of Rome ..." ([44*], V. 3, p. 358359). " Many fantastic tales were woven around the death of Crescentius" ([44*], V. 3, p. 358).



182 Enquete-Codes
To 16b: "The Romans long bewailed the ill-fated Crescentius ... it is not without reason that from this time onward until late in the 11th century, the name is discovered with such striking frequency in the annals of the city. Many families bestowed it on the sons in memory of the brave champion of Roman liberty" ((44], V. 3, p. 433).
17a. Legend of perfidy leading to John's execution. Herodias' cunning, perfidiously making John the Baptist to be executed. Thus, Herodias responsible for John's death (see permutation)
17b. Legend of perfidy leading to Crescentius' execution. Otto's cunning, who deceitfully imprisoned Crescentius. Stefania responsible for Otto's death
To 17b: "According to other versions, which were also in abundance, Crescentius' death was attributed to the disgraceful betrayal on the part of Otto" ([44*], V. 3, p. 358-359). It is alleged that Otto promised to grant clemency to Crescentius through the warrior Tamm. When Crescentius surrendered on these terms, Otto condemned John to death as a traitor ([44*], V. 3, p. 359). Crescentius' execution was such an important political event that even the death of Otto III in 1002 is connected with John Crescentius in the legends surrounding him ([44*], V. 3, p. 404).
Herodias-the wife of Herod and responsible for the death of John Crescentius
Stefania-the wife of John Crescentius and responsible for the death of Otto Ill (Otto's mistress as per some versions; cf. left column)
The term "wife" has been interposed here, and hence the names of the husbands have been reversed.
"Otto's death was soon converted into a legend. It was rumored that the new Medea in the form of Crescentius' widow entangled Otto in her charms. Pretending to heal the ailing emperor, she wrapped him in a poisoned deerskin. According to another version, she poisoned his drink, while a third version maintains that she put a poisoned ring on his finger ..." ([44*], V. 3, p. 404).
18a. Birth of Christ in John's time 18b. Possible birth of Hildebrand under Crescentius
Crescentius' activity is referred to 991-998 A.O. Besides, there exists another Crescentius, also John, who allegedly was a son of the first John Crescentius. Like his father, he ruled Rome from 1002 to 1012 A.O. ([44], V. 4, p. 5). He was little known. It is possible that it is just another version of the John Crescentius legend. Note the great events of religious nature in the history of other countries, which are related only to John Crescentius (e.g., conversion of Russia to Cristianity c. 988 A.O.), whereas his activity is dated just around the end of the 10th c. A.O.



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 183
3. Jesus Christ and Gregory VII Hildebrand (11th c. A.D.). Now, ifwe move upwards on the time axis, we reach the epoch of Gregory VII (Hildebrand). The well-known church reformer is regarded as one of the greatest popes. His reform had most serious social and political consequences (in particular, Church Schism). As the author of the well-known decree on the priests' celibacy, which stirred Germany, France, Spain and Italy, he was the first to advance the idea of the Crusades, and demanded to make secular rulers subordinate to papal authority. The consequence of this forceful overthrow was a ferocious struggle lasting for 50 years among the partisans of the old church and the new reformed one.
Hildebrand
la. Born in c. 1020, i.e., in 18th year of Henry II (saint, i.e., august) Augustus of the Holy Roman-German Empire (see Figs. 11, 12, Table 7)
Christ
lb. Born in 23rd (or 27th) year of rule ofAugustus Octavian of the Second
Roman Empire (= Roman Empire in 10-13th cc. A.D.)
The difference of the right and left dates is 5 (or 10) years under the shift X +300, both dates being almost coincident.
2a. Died in 1085 A.D. 2b. Died in c. 33 A.D. (= 1086 A.D.?)
Applying the shift X + 300, we obtain: 753 + 300 + 33 = 1086 A.D. The dates
1085 and 1086 A.D. are very consistent.
3a. In 1049 A.D., Hildebrand arrived in Rome, and his reformation activity started [44]
3b. In accordance withformulaX +300, Christ was "born" in 1053 A.D., which differs by only 4 years from 1049 A.D.
Thus, the Christian era started in 1053 A.D., which was the start of the Gregorian reforms (Church Schism in 1054 A.D.)!
4a. 1054 A.D., well-known date referring to division of Western and Eastern churches. Start of "Christian" era (?)
5a. Hildebrand was "joiner". His birth described as that of God ( "flames sprang from his head ...") ([44], V. 4, p. 168)
4b. 1st year A.D. was year of beginning of new, evangelical religion, which precisely overlaps with evangelical "explosion" in 11th c. A.D. under shift 5b. Christ was called "son of carpenter". His birth is that of God



184
6a. No data about his mother, but as boy he lived in S. Maria on the Aventine, his uncle being Abbot. Born in Italy (44]
7a. Hildebrand was greatest reformer, enemy of all sorts of "old-believers". Famous decree against selling church posts
Sa. Hildebrand started reform in 1049 A.D. when he was 29 or 30 years of age, being born in 1020 A.D. (his "church birth" occurred in 1049 A.D.), which supplies two versions for his "age", viz., 36 and 65 years
9a. Reform officially culminated (started?) in 1054 A.D. with Church Schism 15 years after death of Conrad II in 1039, i.e., in 15th year of rule of Roman emperor Henry III "the Black" 10a. Countess Matilda, who possessed half of Italy, and disposed of her estates for his sake (44]

6b. Christ's mother Mary declared Saint. Starting with 13th c. A.D., chronicles assert that archangel Gabriel appeared before Mary in Italian town of Loreto where she lived ([78], p. 198)
7b. Christ was greatest reformer who fought "old-believers" . Legend of driving traders out of temple (Lk 19 : 45-47)
Sb. "When Jesus began his work he was about thirty years old ..." (Lk 3:23). There exist two versions of Christ's age, viz., 33 and almost 50 years, the first being the more probable. However, second figure, 50 years, is close to 65 years
9b. Christ's reform started in 15th year of "Black" emperor Tiberius (Lk 2:1; cf. overlapping of Second Empire with that in 10-13th cc. A.D. under
X + 300 shift)
10b. Christs' companion, repentant sinner Mary Magdalene, who and "many others, which ministered unto him of their substance", "... women provided for them out of their own resources" (Lk 8:3)
To 10: The name of the Countess was written Matilda ([44], V. 4, p. 182, Note 1) or Mathilda, which sounded roughly like Madgilda or Magdalene (?), whereas the name of the evangelical Mary was just Magdalene.
It is believed that Matilda was an "ideological ally" of Hildebrand, "a friend of Gregory and the genius-preserver of the papal hierarchy ([44*], V. 4, p. 148). It is alleged that this "famous lady ... did not observe the marital vows ... her husband was frequently away" ([44*], V. 4, p. 148). (It should be recalled that according to the Gospels, Maria Magdalene was a sinner who had confessed). Special detailed discussions were made in the chronicles of the 11th century about whether the relations between Matilda and Hildebrand went beyond "platonic" (the Roman catholic church insists that the relations between Gregory and Matilda were "platonic"). However, "malicious and spiteful tongues ... cast a shadow of doubt over these relations" ([44*), V. 4, p. 148). The Gospels also touch on the intimate relations between Christ and Magdalene. This issue is also discussed in early christian texts.



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
Speaking of the absence of coins for the Roman papal period between 984 and the times of Leo IX (mid 11th century), Gregorovius remarks, "It is even more surprising that no coins have remained from Gregory VII ([44*], V. 4, p. 74, Comm. 41)
185
However, medieval coins with Christ's portrait (and the accompanying inscription) do exist. Hence, it can be assumed that the coins of Gregory VII Hildebrand do exist but are attributed to Christ. This is in accord with the for
mula X + 300
The spiritual father of Hildebrand was the Pope Leo IX (1049-1054), born as Bruno in real life (!) ((44*], V. 3, p. 57). It should be recalled that Pope Bruno (with a different "number") played a significant role in the "John Crescentius affair". A confusion between the two Brunos probably caused a displacement of John the Baptist (Crescentius) closer to Christ (Hildebrand) on the time scale from its "actual" position in the 11th century chronicles which are themselves "multi-layered documents" compiled as a result of displacements.
Pope Leo IX was the "spiritual father" of Hildebrand. He started the church reforms in 1049 that were continued successfully by Hildebrand. If Hildebrand was "God", Leo IX was God's "father"
Leo (Arius) was the "spiritual father" of Asa, or Basil the Great, or Jesus (see the isomorphisms above). It was Arius (Leo in translation) who began the church reforms ( "founded" the Aryanism). Asa (Jesus) later completed the reforms
In the Bible (The Book of Joshua), Joshua is preceded by Aaron, i.e., lion, viz., Arius. The pair Leo (Arius)-Asa (Jesus) are encountered in the above isomorphisms (as well as in a large series of Biblical isomorphisms which are omitted for want of space). By the way, Aaron (and Moses) also passed on their mission (according to the Gospels) directly to the evangelical Christ (see also the Qoran in which Aaron and Moses are called the uncles of Jesus Christ, see above).
Pope Leo IX ruled for 5 years (10491054) ([44*], V. 4, p. 57)
Leo-Arius for 3 or 8 years (two versions: 325-330-333 A.D.) see the biblical parallels above
The 11th-c. chronicles discussed the problem of the relations between Hildebrand and Matilda in detail (was the love platonic?).
lla. Hildebrand came to Rome in 1049 llb. Christ's arrival in Jerusalem with A.D. with group of his partisans, which was start of his service to Leo IX
group of apostles started Jesus' service
To 11: Medieval texts compared the arrival of Leo IX and Hildebrand in Rome with the appearance of the apostles (44].

"In February 1049, the new Pope (Leo IX-A. F.) accompanied by a small suite entered Rome. He was barefooted and humbly chanted the prayers. Such an unusual sight left the Romans astounded. It appeared that the Apostle had come to the town. This bishop was not accompanied by the mighty nobles. He knocked at the city gates like an ordinary pilgrim, asking the Romans if they would accept him in the name of Christ ... However, the small contingent of people accompanying the new Pope also included a person whose spiritual strength was higher than the king's rule ... This man was Hildebrand" ([44*), V. 4, p. 57).
12a. During culmination of reform, conspiracy against Hildebrand in 1075 A.D., organized by Cencius. Attempt on Hildebrand's life [44}
13a. Conspiracy ended in failure; though Hildebrand was on verge of perishing, he stayed alive ([44}, V. 4, p. 157 et seq.)
14a. Sharply negative attitude of llthc. chronicles towards Cencius, who was related to Hildebrand's party
15a. Cencius soon became leader of malcontents in Rome, heading antiHildebrand movement. Chronicles described Cencius' deeds as treason
12b. Judas' conspiracy against Christ, attack on him, and his "Crucifixion"
13b. Though Christ suffered and then "died", he was resurrected, and appeared before his disciples
14b. Sharply negative attitude of Gospel towards Judas, who was among Christ's apostles
15b. Judas soon joined malcontents in Jerusalem, and spoke to Pharisees. Gospel described Judas' deeds as treason. Hence, widespread term "Judas the traitor"
"In chronicles of those times (to be more precise, containing narratives of those times-A. F.), Cencius is portrayed as a shameless robber and adulterer ... This damning portrayal of the leader of the Kadal party was perhaps no exaggeration." ([44*], V. 4, pp. 126-127.)
Cencius took part in Hildebrand's reforms, and was closely associated with his party ([44*], V. 4, p. 126)
Judas took part in Christ's reforms, and was one of his 12 apostles and pupils (see Gospel)
Stefan, Cencius' father, was the prefect of Rome and maintained good relations with Hildebrand's party. Moreover, Cencius was from the Crescentius race (see the superimposition of Crescentius on Baptist), i.e., from the forerunners of Christ.
Cencius soon became head ofthe party of disillusioned Romans and led the revolt against Hildebrand ([44*}, V. 4, p. 155)
Judas soon joined the discontented (in Jerusalem) against Jesus' reforms and conspired with Pharisees. See the Gospels



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift
Chronicles of 11th century view the further acts of Cencius as a betrayal of Hildebrand. He repaid Hildebrand's kindness to him by treachery ([44*], V. 4, p. 155)
187
The Gospels describe the acts of Judas as a betrayal of Jesus and his deeds. Judas paid back the reformer "by treachery". Hence the usage Judas the traitor
In the beginning of 1075, Cencius attempted to overthrow Hildebrand. The coup was abortive and the prefect of the city filed a case against Cencius, but Hildebrand himself (and Matilda) rose in support of Cencius who was released exceptionally owing to the intervention of the reformer ([44*], V. 4, p. 155). A lunar eclipse occurred in 1075. This eclipse is mentioned in the Gospels as the one coinciding with Christ's crucifixion.
16a. "He (Cencius-A. F.) meditated revenge. Since the breach with Henry had become irreparable, he formed a scheme for Gregory's overthrow. In the name ofthe Romans he urged Henry (emperor-A. F.) to seize the power in the city, and promised to deliver the Pope a prisoner ..." ([44], V. 4, p. 100)
16b. "... Judas Iscariot ... went to the chief priests to betray him to them" (Mk 14:10-11)" ... and Judas went to the ... officers ... to discuss ways and means of putting Jesus into their power" (Lk 22:4-5)
The Gospels do not state the possible motives behind Judas' treachery, although they were discussed many times in the Christian literature as an important theological problem. Other chronicles of the 11th century (see above) are more plausible and soberly link "Cencius' treachery" with the struggle for power in Rome.
17a. "The scene at Christmas of 1075 is one of the most hideous in the history of medieval Rome. The Pope read the usual mass on the
vigil of the festival at the altar of the Presepio in S. Maria Maggiore; shouts and the clash of arms arose; Cencius rushed into the church, sword in hand, with the nobles who were his fellow-conspirators." ([44], V. 4, p. 191)
18a. "He seized the Pope by the hair at the altar, dragged him bleeding away, threw him on his horse, and galloped through the city by night
17b. "Suddenly, while he (Jesus-A. F.) was still speaking (praying with his disciples-A. F.), Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared, and with him a
crowd armed with swords and cudgels, sent by the chief priests, lawyers, and elders". (Mk 14:43-44). Like Hildebrand, Jesus was sermonizing with his disciples
18b. "Then they seized him (JesusA. F.) and held him fast" (Mk 14:46). "Some began to spit on him, blindfolded him, and struck him with

19a. "The city was in uproar, the alarm bells were rung, the people rushed to arms, the priests with lamentations veiled the altars ..." (ibid.) However, there was no open armed military confrontation ([44], V. 4, pp. 191-192). Hildebrand forgave Cencius (cf. Jesus "forgiving" Judas)

their fists, crying out, 'Prophesy!' And the High Priests' men set upon him with blows" (Mk 14:65). Events occurred at night
19b. "When his (Jesus'-A. F.)followers saw what was coming, they said, 'Lord, shall we use our swords?' And one of them struck at the High Priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus answered, 'Let them have their way' " (Lk 22:49-51). But no open armed confrontation followed

To 23a.: Peter headed an army of hermits in the times of Hildebrand, whose influence "borders on the mysterious, and can perhaps only be compared with that of the schools of the prophets of the Old Testament" ([44], V. 4, p. 103). Peter Damiani was known as a religious zealot of the reformed church of Gregory VII: "As Hildebrand represents the statesmanlike head of the Church, so does Damiani her sensitive heart" ([44], V. 4, pp. 107-108). Damiani then became cardinal and bishop of Osta (ibid.). He died in 1072 A.D. "... with the reputation of having been the most pious man of the Church of his time" ([44], V. 4, p. 162). His cause was immediately taken up by another Peter, the so-called Peter the Hermit, who headed a crusade (ibid.).



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 189
These two Peters are the unique "famous Peters" about which llth-c. chronicles speak so much. It is possible that they have also been mentioned in the Gospel under the collective image of "Peter Simeon".
According to ancient Russian chroni- One of Christ's apostles was Andrei; see cles, Russia was baptized by the apostle Mark's Gospel 1:16. Like other apostles, Andrei [103, p. 121-122). However, ac- he walked around the world, spreading cording to traditional chronology Rus- Christ's word. According to traditional sia's baptization occurred at the end of chronology, he lived in the first century 10th or in the beginning of 11th century
The dating of Russia's baptization by the apostle Andrei in 10-1 lth century A.D. is in marked contrast with the dating of Andrei's life (by 1000 years), but is in
ideal agreement with the formula X + 300, according to which the period 10-11th century A.D. corresponds to the flourishing of "baptization" and evangelism" (John Crestentius, Hildebrand).
According to the traditional history, the legend about Russia's baptization by the apostle Andrei is a "later insertion" to the annals of history [103, p. 121). However, in XVI century, Ivan the Terrible "indicated that Russians accepted christianity not from the Greeks, but from the apostle Andrei himself. This was brought to the notice of the Greeks a century later by the monk Arsenii Sukhanow who was sent
... to Greece ..." [103, p. 121). According to our formula X + 300, the baptization of Russia by Andrei is an irrefutable fact.
4. Star flares in the Second Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. The "evangelical star" in 1 A.D. and star flare in 1054 A.D. Note one very important fact. The attempt on Gregory's life (and his "suffering") occurred in 1075 A.D. It was just in 1075 A.D. that a lunar eclipse occurred, whose characteristics were described in the Gospel during the "Crucifixion" (see above). Thus, we possess a striking agreement of astronomical dating with dynastic overlappings. Recall that 1075 A.D. is a unique satisfactory solution of the so-called "evangelical" eclipse. A similar coincidence exists also in dating the so-called supernovae flares. The complete list of star flares (their dates) which are regarded as reliable is given in [35], [254): 2296 B.C., 2241 B.C., 185 A.D., 393, 668, 902, 1006, 1054, 1184, 1230, and the subsequent spikes in 16th century (see Kepler's list). This list indicates only one flare (185 A.D.) during the Second Empire. We should also add here the famous "evangelical" star described in the Gospel to have occurred at Christ's "birth" (Mt 2:2,7,9-10). The Wise men: "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east ... Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared ... The star, which they saw in the east, went before them ..." (Mt 2:2, 7, 9-10).
Kepler studied the astronomical picture of the first century B.C. in order to find the "remnants" of the celebrated "Bethlehem star". The chronicler Ideler also studied this "Magis' star" (Context 1978, pp. 128-129).

Remains of star flared in 1054 A.D. edly in iconography, painting, and in Crab nebula. This flare was many chronologists attempted to mentioned in many medieval docudate Christ's "birth" by it alone ments
These two flares are ideally coincident under the 1,053-year shift.
27a. Flare in 185 A.D. 27b. Flare in 1230 A.D.
They are made coincident under the 1,053-year shift with a difference in 8 years.
28a. Flare lasted for 7 months 28b. Flare lasted for 8 months
Thus, the whole list of star flares of the Second Empire turned out to be isomorphic under the 1,053-year shift to part of the star list of the empire of the 10-13th cc. A.D. It is probable that the flare of the star in 1054 A.D. ("evangelical"), visible even in
the daytime (!), caused a religious stir in the 11th c. A.D., which was expertly managed by Gregory VII. The problem regarding the dating of evangelical events by an eclipse described in the Gospel and many early Christian documents is of long history and was repeatedly discussed by the astronomers. Our point of view is that the description of the eclipse in early Christian sources and in the Gospel is rather confused; we do not regard these data as worthy of attention, and are forced to discuss the problem only for the following reasons, viz., with respect to a long dispute regarding the dating of the astronomical data and the relation of the legends of Christ to the start of the first millennium, an important reference point for the establishment of dates.
5. Eclipse that occured during the Crucifixion. That an eclipse occurred during the "Crucifixion" is mentioned by many Christian authors such as Phlegon, Africanus, Synkellos, Eusebius ([13), V. 4. pp. 386-388). However, these authors did not come to an agreement as to the nature of the eclipse: whether it was lunar or solar. The reason for the confusion is that the Gospel according to Luke has the words "darkness fell all over the earth ... and the sun was darkened" (Luke 23:44-45), which caused the difference in opinion. For example, Phlegon wrote that the total solar eclipse lasted from six to nine, or three hours (ibid., p. 386), which is impossible, for a solar eclipse may be no more than eight minutes long, whereas three hours is just a normal figure for a total lunar eclipse. Moreover, according to Phlegon, there was a full moon, which once more indicates the complete misunderstanding of the



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 191
essence of the problem: There could only be a lunar eclipse at a full moon (ibid.). Therefore, the 16-19th-c. chronologists were mostly concentrated on the search of a lunar eclipse to which the above and other data refer. Another lunar eclipse of A.D. 33 was suggested, only today regarded as a confirmation of the traditional "Crucifixion" date. Besides, it is assumed traditionally that Christ was "crucified on a cross". However, the Greek original mentions staur6s instead, which means a pole (all derivatives of the term having the same meaning). By the way, in some translations (e.g., Slavonic), a form is preserved which is closer to the original, viz., "With the Romans, the execution by crucifying on a cross was performed totally differently, viz., a large pole was planted into the soil, the criminal led to it, drawn on ropes upwards and then fastened ... No such cross as represented on Christian icons was employed by the Romans" ([88], p. 179). We now turn our attention to the Gospel and the material regarded by the traditional chronologists as a basis for dating the "evangelical" eclipse. It is assumed traditionally that all the events are described in the Julian calendar, but the count of the day hours starts with 6 p.m. (according to contemporary time count). In fact, it is said in the text that it was the eve of the Jewish Sabbath (Jn 19:38,42), and the Jews started the count of a new day with the evening. "Early on Sunday morning ... Mary Magdalene came to the tomb" (Jn 20:1). Thus, the body was removed on Friday in the daytime and, therefore, was hanging all night from Thursday to Friday (according to the modern count), i.e., all night of the Jewish Friday. "The hour of the crucifixion was nine in the morning ..." (Mk 15:25-26). "At midday a darkness fell over the whole land, which lasted till three in the afternoon ..." (Mk 15:33-34). Friday, Saturday and Sunday-all these days, as correctly noted by F. Ginzel, may be found only in the Julian calendar; besides, Sunday is the first day of the week. While associating the Julian Friday with the date of Christ's suffering, church tradition also insists on the use of just this calendar in the Gospel. For example, J. Blair indicates that Jesus Christ was crucified on Friday, whereas his tables refer to the Julian calendar ([74], Table 13). The Julian Friday is also recognized by other chronologists (see [173], V. 2, p. 541). Besides, according to tradition, Judaea was at that time under Roman power and the Roman, i.e., Julian, calendar was used. Now, we shall discuss the hour count in the Gospel. According to F. Ginzel, the Romans started counting the day from midnight, whereas the Jews from sunset (i.e., 6 p.m. according to the modern count) (ibid.). There were 24 hours in the Jewish day, 12 hours in the day time and as many at night. Thus, the day started with 12 hours at night, and ended with 12 hours in the day time. Since tradition ascribes the authorship of the Gospel and participation in these events to the Jews, it is natural that the Gospel should employ the Jewish hour count. Nevertheless, we are not going to predetermine what the method of counting the hours was, and discuss both versions, Jewish and Roman. It turns out that the hypothesis for the Roman way of counting hours is untenable, and there is no convenient eclipse. As was noted above, the chronologists suggested April 3, A.D.

33, as a solution. The study of eclipses reveals that the solution is very strained. Besides, F. Ginzel extremely noncategorically establishes its correspondence to church tradition ([172), No. 36; [173], p. 541). This is quite clear because the phase was 7", the start of the eclipse (Jerusalem time) 15 hrs. 44 min., and the end 18 hrs. 37 min. A lunar eclipse can be visible only after the sunset. With the phase of 7", a little more than half the moon is in the earth's shadow. The eclipse could be visible in Jerusalem only for a few minutes immediately after sunset as a chip sliding off the lunar disc, and filling no more than one-twelfth of the disc's diameter. Besides, the eclipse does not at all satisfy the evangelical time intervals, and, lastly, no "darkness over the whole land" for three hours can be spoken of. We do not even mention the fact that it occurred at the spring equinox. Such "solutions" can be indicated practically every five years. Applying the formal dating method, and assuming that the "Crucifixion" could have occurred from 200 B.C. to 800 A.D., N. A. Morozov offered as a solution 368 A.D. (though assuming that the "Crucifixion" occurred in March) ([13], V. 1, pp. 9697). Because N. A. Morozov supposed that traditional chronology is basically correct starting with the 4th c. A.D., he analyzed the eclipses "only until the 8th c. A.D., i.e., from deepest antiquity until the second half of the Middle Ages (not continuing further due to impracticality)" (ibid.). However, I approached the problem more formally and extended the computations upwards into the Middle Ages for the purpose of deriving a complete and objective picture. It is interesting that an exact (!) solution was then found, viz., the lunar eclipse of April 3, 1075 A.D., which was a Friday as required by the conditions of the problem (ibid.). The coordinates of the culmination point of the eclipse were +10° longitude and -8° latitude. The eclipse was visible in all the regions of interest in Europe and the Near East (the eclipse phase was 4"8). As is traditionally believed today, the "Crucifixion" occurred two days before Passover (certainly not earlier than the equinox). In particular, the said eclipse of A.D. 33 occurred on April 3, just two days before Passover, which was on April 5, Sunday, A.D. 33. The exact solution, April 3, 1075 A.D., discovered, therefore occurred on the traditional day of the "Crucifixion", but in another year, and also two days prior to Passover, on April 5, Sunday. From this standpoint, our exact solution coincides with the traditional one adopted by the Church; however, the date we found is considerably later than the traditional one, and is 700 years later compared with the one given in [13), V. 1. Here, the chronological shift is
1075 - 33 = 1042 years, which is close to the 1,053-year shift to be discussed below. The eclipse phase was 4"8, i.e., small. In the previous sections, while analyzing the history of the 11th c. A.D. and especially the "biography" of the pope Gregory VII Hildebrand, we saw that the eclipse of 1075 A.D. is consistent with the other events occurring in the 11th c. A.D. It is interesting that astronomical data point to the occurence of the "Crucifixion" at the longitude of Rome, and not near Jerusalem as asserted by orthodox tradition. It is important that it was only in the 6th c. A.D. that the date of Jesus' "birth" began to interest the chronologists! "For more than five centuries, the Christians had no era of their own, and had not given a single thought to the time of Christ's birth (!-A. F.). No attempt to



The 1,053-year Chronological Shift 193
resolve this, we believe, quite important problem for all Christianity is recorded in the history of these centuries, and there are no historical notes based on the time when Christ was born" ([147], p. 96). It is believed in traditional history that the use of the term "Christian era" was first suggested by Dionysius Exiguus, a Scythian monk and biblical scholar; however, it was not accepted, and, besides this unique mention, no document until the 7th c. A.D. had spoken of the Christian era. It was only in the 7-8th cc. A.D. that the English historian Bede the Venerable (c. 672-735 A.D.) made use of it; however, his chronicle is unique in this sense for the 7th c. A.D., and the term Christian era got into more frequent use only since the 10th c. A.D. The so-called "Diocletian era" was most widespread in the times of Dionysius (and before him), who allegedly had no desire to count years from the pagan king, and switched to counting years since the birth of Christ (but only for the so-called paschal cycle), 248 since Diocletian, amounting to 532 B.C. ([152], pp. 90-91). The original of Dionysius' texts was not preserved and his "computations" were restored only in the 19th c. A.D. by F. Ginzel and R. Schram [153], [194]. It is strange that Christmas should be regarded by traditional history as of Roman origin [224], [234]. Astronomically, the longitude where the Crucifixion took place is that of Rome. The oldest representation of Jesus' trial is the 6th-c. mosaic in Ravenna ([13], V. 1, p. 93). Of certain interest are stories in the menology (ibid., pp. 118-154). Opening the collection, we see on the first page: "January 1: St. Basil the Great". But "basilikos' in Greek means "royal" (basileus), i.e., the Christian era started with a holy Great King. Who was he? Why was he so important? Why is he the "great Father of the Church" [220]? He was born in 333 A.D. Much material demonstrating that the legends of Jesus (1st c. A.D.) and of the Great King Basil are practically identical (4th c. A.D.) was gathered in [13], V. 1. Here, we omit all the parallels, and refer the reader to N. A. Morozov. Note that these almost identical "biographies" are made coincident by the 333-year shift. We do not assert that Basil the Great and Jesus are the same person. We only stress the far-reaching parallel between the legends of these two personalities, even when comparing explicitly fantastic ones. It is probable that they were copied from another source (Hildebrand?). Note that no other saint but Basil the Great in the menology is supplied with a detailed "biography" that is nearly identical with that of Jesus. It was conjectured ibid. that the Crucifixion of the Great King (Jesus) was carried out due to the religious cult identifying the volcano (Vesuvius) and its smoke column (stauros). According to the volcanic cult mentioned in the Bible (see Part 1), the criminals were probably executed by being fastened near the volcano's stauros', i.e., crater, after which the God Volcano had to decide whether to chastise the criminal with stones, smoke, fire, etc., or pardon him. The Great King was probably crucified just in this manner. Since the biblical "Mt. Sinai", "Horeb", is most probably identified with Vesuvius, the Crucifixion occurred in Italy, not far from Rome, to which the above observation leads, in particular since the accompanying lunar eclipse satisfies all the conditions of the problem only for Rome's longitude, i.e., where Vesuvius is situated. It is hardly an accidental coincidence. The image of the "cross" to which Jesus was nailed could also have been derived from the stylized

representation of the same smoke column (stauros) over Vesuvius; as a matter of fact, the column rising to great heights then starts spreading and forms a gigantic letter T, or a cross (see the photograph in [13], V. 1).
4.5. The Third Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. The 720-year chronological shift as the difference between the first and second basic chronological shifts. The Trojan war, Gothic war and Italian war in the 13th c. A.D.
Since we do not have the space here, we omit the comparison of the enquete-codes of the Second Roman Empire and the Roman Empire in the 10-13th cc. A.D. Note that, since the Second and Third Roman Empires are parallel, there must be an isomorphism between the Third and 10-13th-c. Roman Empires. Such an isomorphism is, in fact, there (see Table 5, Figs. 45, 46). We now dwell on the last stage, viz., the parallel between the events of the 13th and 6th cc. A.D. in Italy. Being the difference of the two principal shifts, it is 720 years long (1053 - 333 = 720 years).
Third Roman Empire in the 3rd-6th cc. A.D. la. Fierce fighting, anarchy. Large group of emperors ruling for a short time: Severus, Ricimer, Petronius. Shift precisely by 720 years [44]
2a. Odoacer =Odo+ CR (kaiser)= Otto + Kaiser (?) , ruling for 17 years in 476-493 A.D. in Rome
Roman Empire in the 10-13th cc. A.D. lb. Fierce fighting, anarchy, group of emperors ruling for a short time: Subur (Severus?), Rainerius (Ricimer?), Petrus (Petronius?) Names are clearly close
2b. Otto IV. According to F. Gregorovius, he was crowned (1201 A.D.) and ruled for 17 years in Rome (1210-1218 A.D.)
The durations and the time intervals of the rules themselves are remarkably consistent under the 720-year shift. See the data in [44], [74], [128], [134].
3a. Animosity between Odoacer and Theodoric. Odoacer was older. They actually co-ruled for some time. Theodoric came to power in 493 A.D. and defeated Odoacer in battle
3b. Animosity between Otto IV and Frederick II. Otto IV was older. They co-ruled. Frederick came to power in 1218 after Otto's death. Otto IV was defeated in battle by Frederick II
The dates are practically coincident under the 720-year shift (1218 - 493 = 725 years). The names "Theodoric" and "Frederick" are nearly identical.
4a. Death of Boethius who became vie- 4b. Death of Peter de Vineis who betim of Theodoric's suspiciousness came victim of Frederick's suspi[44]. Names are close c10usness



1,053-year Chronological Shift 195
The parallel was noted by F. Gregorovius himself: "The fall of Peter de Vineis ... fell like a shadow across the life of the Great Emperor (Frederick-A. F.), in the same ways that the death of Boethius overshadowed the life of Theodoric the Great. The two German kings resembled one another in the last stage of their career ..." ([44], V. 5, p. 263).
5a. Theodoric died natural death. Fall of Gothic (TRQN) dynasty in Italy. Sixth-c. war overlaps with biblical war with Pharaoh 6a. Theodoric of Ostrogoths
6.1. Dynasty ofGoths: Amalaric, Athalaric, Theodahad, Vitiges, his nephew, Gothic ruler from Ravenna (Uraja, Ildibald), in 526-541 A.D., figuring under the name ofone king, Tarquinius Superbus (according to Livy) 6.2a. Totila
6.3a. Roman emperor Justinian 6.4a. Tejas
6.5a. Narses (Belisarius)
5b. Frederick died natural death. Fall of Hohenstaufen dynasty in Italy. Accounts of13th c. called Frederick II "Pharaoh" ([44], V. 5) 6b. Frederick II (Hohenstaufen)
6.1. Conrad IV
6.2b. Manfred
6.3b. Pope Innocent, Roman ruler
6.4b. Conradin 6.5b. Charles of Anjou
This is the short scheme. Because we do not have the space here, we cannot give a detailed comparison of the "biographies", and only confine ourselves to the extremely vivid example. F. Gregorovius absolutely correctly indicates the following parallel: The gloomy Charles of Anjou stepped into the arena of ancient battles between the Roman and German peoples as Narses (!-A. F.), and Manfred assumed Totila's tragic mien (!-A. F.); for, though the balance of forces was different, the situation was essentially the same. The pope invited foreign aggressors to the country to liberate it from the Germans. The Swabian dynasty fell as the Gothic (!-A. F.) once did. The stunning destruction of both powers and their heroes embellished history with a double tragedy on the same classical stage, the latter tragedy seeming to be only the exact reproduction of the former (!-A. F.) ([44], V. 5), ([44*], V. 5, p. 287). The overlapping of Charles of Anjou and Narses is also confirmed by the phonetic parallel. "Charles" meant simply "king" in antiquity. In the 13th c. A.D., coins often contained the inscriptions Karolus and also CAROLVS ([44], V. 5, P. II, p. 369, Note 2). Therefore, "Charles of Anjou" means "Anjou king". In other words, this is Anjou Caesar, CAESAR OF ANJOU, or CESAR AN in abbreviated form. Read from right to left, it sounds like NARASEC, i.e., NRSC, which is practically identical with "Narses". Arabs and Jews read from right to left which turns CESAR AN into Narses.

The culmination point of the war of the 13th c. is the well-known battle of Benevento and the taking of Naples (!), the analogue of the battle of Troy and its capture (according to the Trojan version), or capturing Naples (according to the 6thc. Gothic version). It is remarkable that Benevento is situated near the medieval Troy built by the Greeks (!) in the Middle Ages ([44], V. 4, p. 29). Thus, Troy, the war near it and its fall appear in the war of the 13th c. A.D. "in an identical manner".

Here is what actually occurred in the 13th c. A.D. See also the fall of Constantino
ple (= Troy?) in 1204 A.D. "The celebrated battle of Benevento was fought with scarcely 25,000 men on each side. The long and terrible war between Church and Empire, between Romans and Germans, was brought to a close on a narrow field of battle, in the course of a few hours" ([44], V. 5, P. II, p. 390). And again, as F. Gregorovius absolutely correctly stresses, we cite the parallel with the 6th c. Gothic war: "The valiant Germans (Manfred's army-A. F.) fought and fell like ancient Goths with the courage of heroes ..." ([44), V. 5, P. II, p. 390). "Manfred was only 34 years of age at the time of his fall (Totila also died youngA. F.), and, like Totila (!-A. F.) was glorious both in life and death. And ... as the Gothic hero ... restored the empire of Theodoric, so Manfred raised Frederick's empire ..." ([44], V. 5, P. II, p. 394). The fall of Benevento, Naples and Troy was accompanied by terrible slaughter both in the Gothic and Trojan versions (ibid., p. 397).

Recall that the well-known Trojan horse erected in the square in Troy is the symbol of the Trojan war. It is curious that the history of the 13th-c. war contains a strange legend of the well-known horse statue erected in Naples (Troy's analogue). In particular, the Neapolitans hated Conrad IV "since he ordered to bridle the



The Parallel between the Western Third Roman Empire and the Biblical Kings of Israel 197
horse whose statue was erected in the city square, and revered as 'politically' sacred" [274]. Accounting for the events occurring during the 13th c. A.D., the Byzantine historian Pachymeres employed the terminology and images inspired by the Trojan war (in particular, by Helen= Manfred's wife). Recall that Ramon Muntaner, a 13th-c. Catalonian historian and Dante's contemporary, thought of Homer's Menelaus as a duke of Athens! It was he who was telling about one of the Trojan frontier posts near the island of Tenedos in Atracia (= TRC) in Asia Minor. "Once, when Helen was going there for worship, accompanied by hundreds of knights, she was seen by the Trojan king's son Paris, who killed her entire suite and abducted the beauty duchess" [45]. This story of Muntaner is given in 13th-c. terms and taken as a medieval event.

5.1. The complete table of both streams
The term "Israel" means "God-contending" ([13], V. 1, pp. 416, 437), the word "Judaean" means "God-praising" (ibid.). We do not give any details of the translation, because they are unimportant. According to the Bible, the God-contending and God-praising kingdoms are two parts of a single state split into two factions, similar to the decomposition of the formerly united Roman Empire into Eastern and Western Empires. The first three kings Saul, David and Solomon still ruled one state; the secession occurred after Solomon: Jeroboam I was the first God-contending king who seceded, and Rehoboam the first God-praising king who seceded. Saul, David and Solomon are regarded to be legendary figures. The Bible contains information regarding the duration of the reigns of all Godcontending and God-praising kings. We have compited the complete table of both streams, thoroughly examining all related biblical data and figures (see below). (Fig. 89.)
(1) Jeroboam I reigned for 22 years= Constantine I for 24 years in 313-337 A.D. after the victory over Maxentius; (2) Nadab for 2 years = Constantine II for 3 years

(11) Jehoahaz for 17 years= Theodosius for 16 years in 379-395 A.D.; (12) Joash (or Jehoash) God-contending for 16 years= Arcadius for 13 years in 395-408 A.D.; (13) Jeroboam II for 41 years= Honorius for 28 years in 395-423 A.D.; (14) Zachariah for less than 1 year (viz., 6 months)= Constans III for less than 1 year (viz., 7 months) in 423 A.D.; (15) Shallum for less than 1 year (viz., 1 month) = John for less than 1 year (viz., 2 months); (16) Interregnum for 24 years = interregnum or custody for 21 years in 423-444 A.D.; (17) Menahem for 10 years = Valentinian III for 11 years in 444-455 A.D.; (18) Pekahiah for 2 years= Petronius Maximus for 1 year in 455-456 A.D.; (19) Pekah for 20 years = Ricimer for 16 years in 456-472 A.D.; (20) Anarchy for 2, or 6, or 9 years = anarchy lasting for 3 years in 472-475 A.D.; (21) Hoshea (until he was captured by Shalmaneser) for 1 year or 3 years = Romulus Augustulus (until he was captured by Odoacer) for 1 year in 475-476 A.D.
The above stream in the Third Empire is localized mostly in Rome (i.e., in the Western Empire). Those emperors from the jet, whose residence was Constantinople, were so influential that they also dominated Rome, sometimes even with a co-ruler. It is important that the whole stream of the God-contending kingdom is included in the parallel. Both streams start with great political and religious figures, viz., Jeroboam I, founder or initiator of the so-called Jeroboam's heresy, and Constantine I Augustus, under whom Arianism was introduced and strengthened (analogue of Jeroboam's heresy). Jeroboam fought Rehoboam, who was alienated from him, whereas Constantine I fought with Licinius, who also seceded. Both under Jeroboam I (when the unique kingdom split into God-contending and God-praising parts), and Constantine I (who transferred the capital from Rome to Constantinople), the empires were divided into the Western and Eastern Empires (it was united under Aurelian
= Sulla, Diocletian = Pompey, Constantius I Chlorus = Julius Caesar, i.e., Saul's, David's and Solomon's analogues). According to the Bible, the God-contending people was divided into twelve tribes. Similarly, under Constantine I, the Empire was separated into the 12 dioceses (analogues of the tribes). Moreover, in the Godcontending kingdom, another was added to the twelve tribes (Dinah's children). Similarly, in the Roman Empire, another was added to the above twelve dioceses under Constantius II, son of Constantine I ([13], V. 7). Both streams had two rulers empowered by a "foreign" king. Thus, Hoshea was dominated by Shalmaneser, and Romulus Augustulus by Odoacer. Meanwhile, Shalmaneser was an Assyrian king, whereas Odoacer was Germanic, which precisely corresponds to the identification of the biblical "Assyrian kingdom" with Germany, carried out by N. A. Morozov on the basis of quite a different argument (ibid.). Both theocratic streams end their independent existence with these two rulers. The two last emperors of the Third Empire, Odoacer and Theodoric, are no longer Roman theocrats (or Romans), but profess a "foreign" religion, which was also reflected in the writing of the Bible.
The anarchy and interregnum periods in both streams coincide relative to their position and duration. The "biographies" of the God-contending kings and the corresponding Roman emperors (if they are made coincident in the chronological sequence) contain a large

number of identifications and parallels (see some examples below).
We have carried out all those formal investigations which were performed for the Second and Third Empires for this pair of jets, too. It turned out that all the conclusions regarding the Second and Third Empires were also valid here (we omit the details).

7.11. Due to overlapping of legends of Basil and those of Jesus (see below). Valens also overlapped with king Herod, with latter's wife Herodias also being characterized by Bible deprecatingly. Wife ofValens' brother Valentinian identified with infamous debauchee Messalina, when Third Empire overlaps with Second (see above)
7.12. Ruled for 14 years in 364-378 A.D. (ibid.). If we consider pair ValensValentinian I, then total duration is
14 + 11 = 25 years; however, we do not take this version into account, regarding it as artificial

stroyed "Jezebel" (= state church?), during his political rise (in particular, at army commander Alaric's hands; see above)
10.9b. Identification ofchurch with "wife" was repeatedly observed by Christian authors (e.g., Eusebius; see above)
10.lOb. Alaric's invasion shook entire empire; he took Rome in 410 A.D., and wasGoths'kingsince396A.D. [134], p. 446)

llb. Theodosius I
11.lb. Was ardent Christian ([134], p. 444)

God's = Yahweh's sign)
11.3b. Theodosius' rule was marked by long and hard war with Goths (ibid.)
11 .4b. Goths' invasion was barbaric from stand-point ofempire's chronicles

12.4b. Arcadius made wars with two kings Alaric and Radagaisius, who were Goths' and Germans' leaders, respectively (ibid.)
12.5b. We have repeatedly mentioned overlapping of "Germans" (and Goths) and "Syrians" or "Assyrians"

13.5a. Hazael's and Ben-hadad's defeat 13.5b. Honorius again defeated Alaric in was probably described by: "There- 402 A.D. with Stilicho's armies, fore will I send fire upon the house and killed Radagaisius in 405 A.D., of Hazael, fire that shall eat Ben- which was temporary defeat for hadad's palaces ..."

Honorius (Jeroboam's analogue) in Jeroboam's "biography", and Arcadius (Jehoash's analogue) though, according to 2K 13:24, were, in fact, co-rulers [128], (134], Hazael died still under God-con- (146] tending Jehoash, Jeroboam's predecessor (see above). It probably indicates that Jeroboam II and God-praising Jehoash were corulers
13.7a. Prophet Jonah was active under 13.7b. John Crysostom sent by God, was Jeroboam II, and sent by God active under Honorius and his coto liberate country from enemy ruler Arcadius. Since Ben-hadad (2K 14). N. A. Morozov believed =Radagaisiusdiedin405A.D.and that Jonah was distorted form of Alaric= Hazael in 410 A.D. {both "John" ([13], p. 353) in time of Honorius = Jeroboam II), end of activity of John Crysostom (John!) in 407 A.D., in fact, coincides with end of this powerful barbarian invasion [74], [134]
13.8a. Another prophet, Amos, was active under Jeroboam II (Am 1:4; 2:2)
13.9a. Reigned 41 years (2K 14:23-24)

of the Western Roman Empire. This led to confusion also in the modern monographs. For example, [128] supplies 423-425 A.D. for John without any comment. Therefore, we have made use of the shorter, but more complete account of [146], where the events of this period are described (though very briefly), and John is given a twomonth rule (see also [74]).
16a. Interregnum in the God-contending 16b. "Interregnum" in the Western kingdom Third Empire
16.la. Confusion period started after death of Jeroboam II (see below), and lasted for 24 years
16.lb. As noted above, 423-444 A.D. was time of interregnum (custody): young Valentinian III was in charge of Placidia and Aetius ([124], p. 33) for 21 years
To 16.la: Menahem came to power under contradicting circumstances. It is said in 2K 15:17 that he came to power in the thirty-ninth year of Azariah from the Godpraising kingdom, and reigned ten years. On the other hand, Menahem "attacked Shallum, son of Jahesh ..." (2K 15:14), i.e., he succeeded Shallum (see above) who reigned 1 month, whereas his predecessor Zechariah reigned only 6 months (see below). Thus, Menahem started to reign 7 months after his co-ruler (or predecessor)
Zechariah = Jeroboam II, and between these three rulers there were no breaks. But Jeroboam II died in the fourteenth year of that very Azariah (2K 15:1), reigning 41 years (see above). Thus, between the end of Shallum's rule and the start of Menahem's reign, 24 years disappeared, which was noted by traditional history long ago and was called "interregnum".
17a. Menahem ("consoler")
17.la. Rule characterized by important event: invasion of "Pul king of Assyria" (2K 15:19-20)
17b. Valentinian III
17.lb. Rule characterized by important event, invasion of Attila's armies [124]
17.2a. Invasion occurred at end ofMena- 17.2b. Invasion occurred at end ofValenhem's reign (2K 15) tinian's rule in 452 A.D., whose rule started in 444 A.D., and ended in 455 A.D. 17.3a. Taking into account frequent assimilation of "P" and "T", king Pul can be king "Toi" 17.4a. Pul was king of Assyria
17.3b. Name "Attila" is close to "Tul", which is TL (or TTL) if freed of vowels
17.4b. Attila was king of Huns, and invaded Italy from North
Each time the Bible speaks of a "Syrian" or "Assyrian" invasion, either a Germanic or Gothic one, or, more generally, an invasion from the North, of Italy occurs in the Roman Empire.

17.5a. Under threat of complete defeat, Menahem "... gave him (PulA. F.) a thousand talents of silver ... Menachem laid a levy on all the men of wealth in Israel, and each had to give the king of Assyria ... Then the king Assyria withdrew without occupying the country" (2K 15:19-21) 17.6a. Reigned 10 years (2K 15:17)

17.6b. Ruledfor llyearsin444-455A.D. (see above)
"Assyrian" means "leader" or "tutor" ([13], pp. 371-372). A-USAR means "to walk upright" or "to lead others", which is similar to the German "Fuhrer", meaning "leader". "Assyrians" are characterized by the Bible as warmongers, which corresponds to the overlappings of the "Assyrians" and the Germans, or Goths, and sometimes, probably, the Huns.

To 19b: Ricimer was the actual ruler succeeding several "emperors" that reigned for a short time (see above).



The Parallel between the Western Third Roman Empire and the Biblical Kings of Israel 213
To 19.3b.: In several years, a second king, "migrating monster" Theodoric, will be ruling in the empire, also deporting many people, and mixing the Italian population with the Goths and Germans, which will also be reflected in the Bible by the activity of Theodoric's analogue nicknamed "Tiglath-pileser".
20a. Anarchy in the God-contending 20b. Anarchy m the Western Third kingdom Empire
20.la. Anarchy's duration is estimated by certain historians to be 6-9 years ([13], V. 7, p. 303, Table XVII). However, my analysis led to 2 and 9 years (2K 15:30). We fix 2, 6 and 9 years (see table)
21a. Hoshea ("saved by God")
21.la. Hoshea was enthroned in Samaria after anarchy. Title "saved by God" can be applied to Hoshea only in derision, since almost with start of his rule he became tributary to foreign king Shalmaneser ( "breaking peace") without real power (2K 17:1-4)
20.lb. Ricimerdiedin472A.D. when anarchy started, lasting until 475 A.D.; patrician Orestes enthroning his son Romulus Augustulus ([146], p. 490)

21. lb. 15-year-old Romulus Augustulus, whose name "Augustulus" was derived from name Augustus, was enthroned in Rome after anarchy (again Rome overlaps with Samaria). "The population of Italy gave the teenage 'emperor' mocking nickname 'Augustul', i.e., little Augustus" ([134], p. 450)
21.2a. Reigned no more than 1 year as 21.2b. Ruled for 1 year as independent independent king (2K 17) king in 475-476 A.D. [146]
21.3a. Practically after Hoshea's rule, 21.3b. In 476 A.D., Odoacer defeated state was attacked by Shalmaneser, Roman army commanded by "and Hoshea became tributary to Orestes, became Roman king, him" (2K 17:3-4) succeeding Romulus Augustulus, and ending "purely Roman" dynastic stream in Western Empire (ibid.)
21.4a. Shalmaneser was "king of As- 21.4b. Odoacer was German army comsyria" (2K 17:1-4) mander (ibid.)
21.5a. Shalmaneser "... arrested him (Hoshea-A. F.) and put him in prison" (2K 17:5)
21.5b. Odoacer sent Romulus Augustulus to his estate in Campania, where he ended his lifetime in custody (ibid.)

21.6a. Shalmaneser deported large masses 21.6b. Odoacer deported many people in of God-contending people (2K Italy: German mercenaries set17:6). Bible then described sharp tled throughout of Italy; he conchanges not only in state institu- ceded 1/3 of all land. Roman tions of God-contending kingdom Empire still existed in West un(which was empowered by foreign der 2 foreign kings (conquerors), king), but also radical changes in viz., Odoacer and Theodoric, but, religious life, etc. (2K). Accord- already being introduced to new ing to Bible, Hoshea's "reign" customs, religion, etc., Romulus was end of independent God- Augustulus' rule ended indepencontending kingdom; Hoshea was dent "purely Roman" Western last God-contending king, and Empire further God-contenders continued already within state system foreign to them
Thus, ended the biblical history of the God-contending kingdom and of the "purely Roman" Western Third Empire. The German-Gothic kingdom arose in Italy.
6. The Parallel between the Eastern Third Roman Empire and the Biblical Kingdom of Judah
6.1. The complete table of both streams
The Bible not only directly lists the God-contending and God-praising kings, but also specifies the reigns with respect to another kingdom: The God-contending kings are related to the God-praising ones, and, vice versa, it is indicated when a Godcontending king was enthroned (Fig. 89). This comparison of the Second Book of Kings with the lineage of Jesus Christ, given in the Gospel according to Matthew makes it possible to discover an insertion in the God-praising stream, viz., between Jehoram and Uzziah, four kings were inserted (see 2K): Ahaziah, Athaliah, Jehoash and Amaziah (the indicated four kings are absent in Mt 1:8-9). The Gospel according to Matthew cannot contain a mistake, since it further indicates the sum of the generations from David until the arrival in Babylon, viz., 14 generations, and not 17, as is seen from the Second Book of Kings and Second Book of the Chronicles (for the reason of showing the insertion, see below). Since the God-contending kingdom has overlapped with the Western Empire in 306-476 A.D., it may be supposed that the God-praising kingdom when separated from the God-contending one could overlap with the Eastern, which seceded from the Western.
This conjecture is very well confirmed by the dynastic parallel method. Omitting the details, we specify the complete God-praising kingdom stream and the parallel (isomorphic) jet from the Eastern Empire, discovered by us (see Fig. 59, Table 13),



The Parallel between the Eastern Third Roman Empire and the Biblical Kingdom of Judah 215
and which is different from that suggested by N. A. Morozov. The Eastern Empire stream includes Arius of Alexandria (well-known founder of Arianism) and Basil the Great (great king).
(1) Rehoboam reigning for 17 years = Licinius for 16 years or 11 years in 308324 A.D. or 313-324 A.D.; (2) Abijah for 3 years = Arius for 3 years or 5 (8) years in 330-333 (see above); (3) Asa(= Jesus?) for 41 or 46 years= Basil the Great for 45 years in 333-378 A.D. (4) Jehoshaphat for 25 years= Theodosius I for 16 years in 379-395 A.D.; (5) Jehoroam and the so-called "separation of Edom" lasting for 8 years = Arcadius and the separation of the Western Empire from the Eastern, lasting for 13 years in 395-408 A.D.
Then we have an insertion of 76 years in the God-praising stream, viz., 4 kings (we shall take it into account below; see No 12); (6) Uzziah reigning for 52 years
= Theodosius II and Marcianus for 49 years in 408-450 A.D. and 450-457 A.D.; (7) Interregnum lasting for 2 years = anarchy, Attila's invasion for 2 years in 451453 A.D.; (8) Jotham reigning for 16 years= Leo I for 17 years in 457-474 A.D.; (9) Ahaz for 16 years= Zeno for 17 years in 474-491 years A.D.; (10) Hezekiah for 29 years = Anastasius for 27 years in 491-518 A.D.; (11) Manasseh for 50 or 55 years
= "two Justins": Justin I and Justinian I for 47 years in 518-527-565; (12) 76-year
insertion (4 God-praising kings), king Amon reigning for 2 years (78 = 76 + 2) = 76-year-long interval filled by 5 Byzantine emperors Justin II, Tiberius, Mauritius, Phocas, Heraclius in 565-641 A.D.; (13) Josiah reigning for 31 years = Constans II (= Constans III) for 26 years in 642-668 A.D.; (14) Jehoahaz for less than 1 year= Constantine II for 1 year in 641-642 A.D.; (15) Jehoiakim for 11 years= Constantine IV the Pagan for 17 years in 668-685 A.D.; (16) Jeconiah for less than 1 year = Heraclion I for 1 year in 641-642 A.O.; (17) Zedekiah for 11 years= Justinian II for 10 years in 685-695 A.D. (his first rule), >..(M, H) = 1.4 x 10- 12 .
The characteristic properties of the streams. Since the basic statements are analogous to the corresponding ones in the previous two pairs (Second and Third Empires, Western Third Empire and God-contending kingdom), we only confine ourselves to a brief survey.
The indicated jet in the Eastern Roman Empire in 306-695 A.D. is basically localized in the East. It is important that both jets have exhausted the complete streams. The full durations of the God-praising kingdom of 396 years (see the above durations and their sum) is well consistent with the Byzantine stream of 389 years in 306-695 A.D. (or 395 years if we count it from a round figure, viz., 300 A.D.). It was shown above that the count from 300 A.D. is caused by the existence of a global isomorphism in Roman history.
6.2. A remarkable biographical parallel
Biblical Kingdom of Judah
la. Rehoboam ("who enlarges the people")
Third Eastern Roman Empire
lb. Licinius



216
1.la. Rehoboam and Jeroboam I divided kingdom between themselves (lK 14)
1.2a. Rehoboamreigned in God-praising kingdom with capital in Jerusalem (lK 11:43)
1.3a. "In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem" (lK 14:25-26). The Jewish original mentions misraim (see below)
1.4a. "There was continual fighting between him (Rehoboam-A. F.) and Jeroboam" (lK 14:30-31)
Enquete-Codes
1.lb. Licinius and Constantine I (Jeroboam's analogue) divided Roman Empire between themselves. In 308 A.O., title of "augustus' was conferred on Licinius ([128], p. 792; [134], p. 426)
1.2b. Licinius ruled in Western Empire (ibid.)
1.3b. In fifth year (!) of his rule, i.e., in 313 A.O., Licinius was forced to fight Maximinus, who invaded empire from Asia Minor ([128], p. 792)
1.4b. In 314 A.O., Licinius was attacked by Constantine I, which led to long struggle between them, and ended only after Licinius' death in 324 A.O., defeated by Constantine I ([134], p. 429)
1.5a. Rehoboam reigned 17 years (lK 1.5b. Licinius ruled for 16 years in 30814:21) 324A.O. (Ifwecountfrom313A.O. when Licinius defeated Maximinus, then we obtain 11 years, but this is not principal version.)
To 1.2a. "Jerusalem" means "the City of Holy Conciliation (Peace)", "foundation of the God" ([13], V. 7). Therefore, the term is meaningful and could be applied to different cities (see below).
To 1.3a.: The term misraim ( "Egypt" according to the synodal translation) in N. A. Morozov's opinion does not only mean Egypt (and not so much Egypt), but the whole of the Roman Empire, which is also confirmed by the form RM present in MSRM. Further, under the subsequent overlappings, Judaea will constantly overlap with the Eastern Empire (i.e., situated east of the Italian Rome).
2a. Abijah ("God is father")
2.la. Strangename: "Godisfather". As we shall see below, Bible's attitude to God-praising kings is warm (in contrast to God-contending ones, whom it charges with "following in Jeroboam's footsteps"), but attitude towards "fathered by God" is critical: "All the sins that his
2b. Arius
2. lb. Arius was greatest religious leader, who founded most influential theology Arianism fought with for centuries, and identified above with J eroboam's heresy. Arius proclaimed Father superiority ((134], p. 434). This teaching caused fierce confrontation within Church



The Parallel between the Eastern Third Roman Empire and the Biblical Kingdom of Judah 217
father had committed ... nor has he been faithful to the Lord his God ..." (lK 15:3-4). Hence, since Jeroboam's heresy earlier overlapped with Arianism, "fathered by God" must be closely related to it, which is fully confirmed by right column 2.2a. Reigned 3 years (lK 15:1-4, 7)
2.3a. "Fathered by God" must, in turn, father God. In fact, a biyah (Abijah) fathered Asa (lK 15:8)
in times of Constantine I (ibid.). Formally, Arius was not king, but, after return from exile, and allegedly supported by Constantine I, acquired great influence in Eastern Empire. "Religious" king (ibid.) (remember that Bible is religiously-tinged source)
2.2b. "Ruled" for 8 years or 5, or 3 years in 325 - 333 A.O., 328-333 A.O., or 330-333 A.O., principal version being 3 years (see below)
2.3b. In 333 A.O., Basil the Great (Jesus' analogue)wasborn. Name "Jesus" is close to "Asa"
To 2.3b.: Since the "birth" of Basil the Great (as well as of Jesus) was regarded as
the greatest religious event, the religious power came down from Arius (= "fathered by God") to the newborn "God" Basil(= Asa= Jesus). Recall that, according to the orthodox point of view, Jesus was "God" from his very birth; therefore, from his stand-point of the religious chronicler, Arius' power "ended" in 333 A.O.
To 2.2b.: Since the God-praising stream (also including Arius) overlaps with the Eastern Empire, it is natural to reckon Arius' "rule" in the East since 330 A.O. when the capital was transferred from Rome to New Rome (Constantinople), and then we obtain precisely 3 years for Arius' "rule", which is just what is given in the Bible.
3a. Asa ( "savior")
3.la. Name "Asa" is close to "Jesus", meaning "savior", i.e., same as "Jesus"
3.2a. Asa became king of Judah in the twentieth year of Jeroboam I (lK 15:8-12, 14)
3.3a. As was discovered earlier, Godcontending king Omri overlapped with Valentinian in 364-375 A.O.; it was said in Bible that Omri became king in thirty-first year of Asa's reign (lK 15:23-24)
3b. Basil the Great
3.lb. Isomorphism between legends of Jesus and Basil the Great was exhibited above [13]
3.2b. Since Jeroboam I is analogue of Constantine I, twentieth year of Constantine's reign, reckoning from 313 A.O. when he and Licinius started co-ruling, occurs in 333 A.O., viz.,precisely "birth" ofBasil the Great (Great King)
3.3b. Valentinian, in fact, was enthroned in thirty-first year of Basil (= J e
sus), viz., 333 + 31 = 364 A.O., year of his enthronement



218
3.4a. Asa "reigned" 41 years (reckoned directly) (lK 15:8-12, 14). Subsequent computations yield somewhat different figure, viz., 46 years (we omit details) (lK 15-16; see also above table and [13], V. 7, p. 311)
3.5a. Asa was great religious reformer: "Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord ... He expelled from the land the male prostitutes .. . and did away with all the idols .. . Asa himself remained faithful to the Lord all his life" (lK 15:812, 14-15). "He even deprived his own grandmother Maacah of her rank as queen mother because she had an obscene object made for the worship of Asherah; Asa cut it down and burnt it ... He brought into the house of the Lord all his father's votive offerings ..." (lK 15:13-15)
3.6a. Made war with God-contending king Baasha (lK 15:22-23), who previously overlapped with Constantius II
3.7a. Bible remains silent as to details of Asa's death, and a parallel with
Basil (= Jesus) cannot be established at this point. Asa's "biography" contains no "Crucifixion" 3.8a. Bible regarded Asa as authentic king (lK)
Enquete-Codes
3.4b. Basil the Great died in 378 A.O. in his forty-fifth year (see above). Figures 46 and 45 are very close
3.5b. As was noted above, Basil was great religious reformer, which was especially stressed if we take into account Basil-Jesus isomorphism. He founded principally new religious cult and, in particular, modern Divine Service (see above; cf. also Gospel, e.g., driving sellers, "male prostitutes", etc., out of temple by Jesus)
3.6b. Constantius II was contemporary of Basil the Great(= Asa= Jesus) in 340-361 A.O. (for his struggle with "Asa", see below)
3.7b. Basil's "biography" contains legend of Jesus' suffering (see above), though in milder form than in Gospel. No "Crucifixion" either
3.8b. Basil the Great means "Great King" . Jesus was also called "king" by Gospel
3.9a. Asa was king of Judah (i.e., God- 3.9b. Jesus is called "king of Judah" in praising) Gospel
3.10a. Asa built many cities, which is especially stressed by Bible (lK 15:22-23)
3.10b. Jesus was called tekton in Gospel, i.e., carpenter, city builder (?) ([13], V. 1)
4a. Jehoshaphat ("God's judge") 4b. Theodosius I the Great
4.la. Reigned 25 years (lK 22:41-43, 46) 4.lb. Ruled for 16 years in 379-395 A.D. (see above)



The Parallel between the Eastern Third Roman Empire and the Biblical Kingdom of Judah 219
4.2a. Recall that authors of Books of
Kings treat Abijah (= Arius) and "Jeroboam's heresy" with hostility. "But he did away with such of the male prostitutes attached to the shrines as were still left over from the days of Asa his father" (lK 22:41-43, 46) 4.3a. Moabites' and Ammonites' invasion and their defeat by Jehoshaphat (2Ch 20). We saw above that Moabites often appeared from North (together with "Assyrians")
4.4a. Jehoshaphat built ships for regular communication with Tarshish (2Ch 20:36), town in Spain
4.2b. Regarded as ardent Christian. Arians and other sects were gradually shifted into background, remains of pagan cult subject to energetic persecution [146]
4.3b. Goths' revolt on Balkans under Theodosius I. Bribing Gothic army commanders, Theodosius I succeeded in drawing revolters apart, and came to terms with them (ibid.)
4.4b. Theodosius I was Spaniard, and took part in long Spanish wars. Theodosius' father, also Theodosius, was well-known army commander. Biblical chronicler probably added years of father's rule to those of son's, and obtained 25 instead of 16. However, we retain traditional figure, viz., 16 years
Theodosius I has already been occurred as Jehoahaz.
It is possible that there existed separate chronicles subsequently combined into the Books of Kings, which is confirmed, e.g., by repeated references in the Bible to the The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. Therefore, the same historical figure could appear in the Books of Kings twice. This is a rare phenomenon: Only Theodosius I and Arcadius were reflected in both chronicles, which is not surprising due to their considerable role in the empire's history (cf. Theodosius I the Great). Comparing the attitude of the author of a God-praising chronicle towards Theodosius I(= Jehoshaphat) with the Byzantine sources makes it possible to suggest that the God-praising author was an orthodox Athanasian (presuming favourable attitude towards Jehoshaphat).
5a. J ehoram ("God's archer") 5b. Arcadius
5.la. God-praising king, i.e., ruled 5.lb. Ruled in Eastern Empire [128] in Judah (2K 8)
5.2a. Of all God-praising kings, Bible 5.2b. Of all Byzantine emperors until pays much attention only to Jeho- 526 A.O., chronicles draw especially ram's wife, stressing her "wrong- much attention only to emperor Arness" (2K 8:17-18) cadius' wife, Eudoxia, a powerful and energetic woman strongly influencing her husband (see history of John Crysostom)



220
5.3a. Great event ocurred in Jehoram's times, viz., "separation of Edom". "So Edom has remained independent of Judah (i.e., God-praising kingdom-A.F.) to this day; Libnah also revolted at the same time" (2K 8:22)
5.4a. Edom's separation was peaceful, and the Second Book of Kings and the Chronicles only sadly state fact of separation 5.5a. Reigned 8 years (2K 8:17-18)
Enquete-Codes
5.3b. Any textbook in empire's history informs that, e.g., "the year 395 (i.e., first year of Arcadius' ruleA.F .) was when the Roman Empire separated into Eastern and Western empires" ([128], p. 799). 395 A.D., year ofofficial decomposition ofempire, is one of greatest milestones in rather long process of empire's dissolution. It was with Arcadius that Western and Eastern emperors started to be reckoned separately ([128), p. 793)
5.4b. "The declaration of the formal separation of the unique Roman Empire into two passed unnoticed ..." ([134), p. 445) 5.5b. Ruled for 13 years in 395-408 A.D.
We then have a 76-year-long insertion (4 kings) in the God-praising stream, and omit it, indicating the true position further. Since we do not have the space here, we briefly refer to the next parallel.

9a. Ahaz ( "grasped by God")
9.la. Ahaz was attacked by Rezin king of Syria and Pekah king of Israel, besieging Ahaz, but being unable to take Jerusalem. Ahaz then asked Tiglath-pileserfor help, who supported him, and Rezin's and Pekah's expedition failed (2K 16:25, 7, 9)
9.2a. (1) Rezin of Syria, (2) Pekah God-contending, (3) Ahaz Godpraising, (4) Jerusalem, capital under attack, (5) Tiglath-pileser's support of Ahaz
9.3a. Attack by Rezin and Pekah of Jerusalem failed
9.4a. Name "Rezin" close to "Ricimer"
9.Sa. God-praising Ahaz offered Tiglathpileser help in his war against Rezin and Pekah
9b. Zeno
9.lb. In God-contending kingdom, Pekah overlapped with Ricimer. Then Rezin "king of Syria" overlaps with German king Odoacer (and again "Syrians" are identified with Germans). God-praising king Ahaz overlaps with Byzantine emperor Zenoin474-491 A.O. [146]. Then Tiglath-pileser automatically overlaps with Theodoric
9.2b. (1) Odoacer, German, (2) Ricimer, Westernemperor, (3)Zeno, Byzantine, (4) Constantinople, capital under attack, (5) Theodoric, "monster deporter", support of Zeno (Ahaz's analogue) [146]
9.3b. Constantinople was attacked by Illa, Odoacer's associate (i.e., biblical Rezin) in 484 A.D., who was close to Ricimer in time, and, probably identified with him from biblical chronicler's stand-point (ibid.). Ricimer overlapped with Pekah. Revolt failed 9.4b. Name "Ricimer", 2 years before Byzantine Zeno's (= Ahaz's) rule, transferred by God-praising chronicle to Odoacer, Zeno's co-ruler
9.5b. Byzantine Zeno offered Theodoric ( "monster deporter") to move with Goths to Italy, and become her
ruler in place ofOdoacer (=Rezin) ([128), p. 204)

9.6a. Rezin's and Pekah's attack on Jerusalem ·failed 9.7a. Tiglath-pileser defeated Rezin and killed Pekah (2K 16:9)
9.8a. Tiglath-pileser, "monster deporter", moved people to Kir (?) (2K 16:9)
9.9a. In spite of "monster deporter's" support of Ahaz, their relations became strained: " Tiglathpileser .. . marched against him (Ahaz-A. F.) and far from assisting him, pressed him hard" (2Ch 28:20-21)
9.10a. Bible judges Ahaz harshly, he was even stripped of suffix "iah" (pertaining to God) present in names of most God-praising kings. "He did not do what was right in the eyes of Lord ... He even passed his son through the fire adopting the abominable practice ..." (2K 16:2-3). All of second half of Ahaz's "biography" is devoted to his initiating new custom of sacrificing to Gods of Damascus (2Ch 28) 9.lla. Reigned 16 years (2K 16:2-4)

9.6b. Theodoric's attack on Constantinople in 486 A.D. failed 9.7b. Theodoric defeated Odoacer and killed him(= Rezin) in 472 A.D. [128], [146]
9.8b. Theodoric, "monster deporter", organized mass deportations of empire's population. Gothic tribes were conceded 1/3 of Italian territory (ibid.)
9.9b. In spite of Theodoric's support of Zeno, their relations became strained: In 486 A.D., Theodoric and Goths attacked Zeno (see above), though unsuccessfully ([121], p. 204), and their reconciliation followed ([121], p. 204)
9. lOb. Zeno is well known in empire's history as initiator of new religious customs stirring many religious factions. In 482 A.D., he published so-called Henoticon along with Acacius, in which he tried to reconcile hostile factions. Without satisfying anybody, Henoticon started off religious protests ([121], pp. 207-208)

Whenever a Byzantine emperor supported the Monophysites, the Bible almost always commended his God-praising analogue. Vice versa, the Byzantine anti-Monophysite policy precisely corresponds to the biblical imprecations of the associated God-praising duplicate.

11.3b. As expected, Justinian I persecuted Monophysites, believing them to be heretics ([121], pp. 279280) 11.4b. Justinian I suppressed well-known Nika riot in Constantinople, driving large numbers ofunarmed people to capital's hippodrome, and by

Jerusalem from one end to another" (2K 21:16), clearly meaning to suppress some mutiny in capital
11.5a. It is reported at end of Manasseh's biography that he was captured by Assyrians, repented, and died virtuous (2Ch 33:10-16). This resembles "moral"
12a. Amon and 76-years insertion containing 4 kings: Ahaziah, Athaliah, J oash and Amaziah
12.la. Five God-praising kings (including Amon) altogether ruling for 78 years: Amon for 2, and insertion lasting for 76 years 12.2a. Bible treated Amon harshly, charging him with continuation of Manasseh's policy (2K 21:19-24)
12.3a. Athaliah was usurper included in group of four kings (2K)
12.4a. Amon's and 4 kings' rule described as confusion (conspiracies, overthrows, etc., mentioned) (2K)
12.5a. Athaliah was usurper replaced by J oash ruling for 40 years (2K 11 :2021, 12:1). Bible treated him quite favourably (2K 12:2). It should be expected that his Byzantine analogue favoured Monophysites

massive massacre ([121], pp. 282297). Mutiny was suppressed by massive massacre with extreme cruelty (note overlapping of Jerusalem and New Rome, i.e., Constantinople, again)
11.5b. Justinian's biography was possibly completed with fragments from that of Justinian II, who was, in fact, taken prisoner (see similarity between biographies of J ustinian I and J ustinian II below)
12b. Five emperors: Justin II, Tiberius II, Maurice, Phocas and Heraclius altogether ruling for 76 years
12.1b. Five Byzantine emperors altogether reigning 76 years in 565-641 A.D. [70], [121]
12.2b. Possibly all of them, except Heraclius, continued Justinian's policy of persecuting Monophysites ([121], p. 363)
12.3b. Phocas was usurper included in group of four emperors ([121], pp. 355-363)
12.4b. Five emperors' rule was confusion period. Throne usurped by Phocas, Maurice's murderer, etc. (ibid.)
12.5b. Phocas was usurper and replaced by Heraclius, who ruled in 610641 A.D. for 31 years. "Being unable to suppress the separatists' movement by force, it being related to the Monophysites, the Byzantine government had to seek reconciliation with the former" ([121], p. 369)
We now enter the final phase of the parallel, and are going to consider the three great God-praising kings Josiah, Jehoiakim, Zedekiah and three great Byzantine emperors Constans II, Constantine IV, Justinian II.



The Parallel between the Eastern Third Roman Empire and the Biblical Kingdom of Judah 225
13a. Josiah ("May Yahweh give")
13.la. Reigned 31 years (2K 22:1-2). Starting with him, hard times in God-praising kingdom invaded by Pharaoh Necho, king Nebuchadnezzar, and ended in wars and slavery
13.2a. Pharaoh Necho came with war, and killed Josiah (2K23:29). Bible spoke of God's banishing Israel (2K 23:26-27) attacked by two enemies, Pharaoh Necho and Nebuchadnezzar
14a. J ehoahaz ( "grasped by God")
14.la. Reigned less than 1 year (2K 23:31). Little known. Made war with Pharaoh, was deposed, and died in prison (2K 23)
15a. Jehoiakim ("may God rise up")
15.la. Reigned 11 years (2K 23:36). All his rule was spent in wars with Nebuchadnezzar and Necho (2K 24)
13b. Constans II (also called Constantine III)
13.lb. Ruled for 26 years in 642-668 A.D. From Constans II, hard times in Byzantine Empire, until crisis at end of 7th c. A.D. when Arabic hordes invaded. "The 7th c. A.D. in the history of Byzantine is one of the gloomiest periods ..." ((70], pp. 46-47)
13.2b. Byzantine armies were defeated by Arabs c. 641 A.D. ([121), p. 367). Empire lost provinces after it was attacked by two enemies, Arabs and Bulgars, who eventually established themselves on Balkans in 679 A.D. ([121), p. 368; [124))
14b. Constantine II
14.lb. Ruled for less than 1 year in 641642 A.D. [70). Little known. Made war with Arabs without success. Circumstances of his overthrow and death are unknown
15b. Constantine IV
15.lb. Ruled for 17 years in 668-685 A.D. (ibid.). According to another version, ruled until 679 A.D., which makes 11 years. Name: "standing firm". All his rule was spent in wars with Arabs and Bulgars ([121], pp. 372-373) 15.2a. Fall of Jerusalem was described, 15.2b. "The long 7th-c. wars led to as well as defeat of God-praising the formerly multi-national Eastarmies and crushing "temple", cap- em Roman Empire ceasing to exturing all Jerusalem's citizens (2K) ist" ([121), p. 373)
16a. Jehoiachin ("may God establish") 16b. Heracleon
16.la. Reigned less than 1 year (2K 24:8- 16.lb. Ruled for less than 1 year in 9). Little known. His "biography" 641-642 A.D. His rule practically is practically identical with that unknown. Co-ruled with Con
of Jehoahaz (see above) stantine II (= Jehoahaz), which possibly accounts for similarity of biographies (see left column)



226
17a. Zedekiah ("righteous")
17.la. Reigned 11 years (2K 24:18). Fall of God-praising kingdom. Zedekiah's armies defeated by Nebuchadnezzar, God-praising ones taken into Babylonian captivity, events being close to those of Jehoiakim's epoch (see above)
Enquete-Codes
17b. J ustinian II
17.lb. Ruled for 10 years in 685-695 A.D. in his first rule. Crisis of empire: loss of provinces, so-called "Dark Age". Change of dynasties, Justinian II was principal historical personage of this period as well as Nebuchadnezzar (see left column)
The God-praising kingdom ended just when the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire started, traditionally believed to be the late 7th c. The parallel ends here. The three parallels above are not basic in the GCD, because they are consequences of other, more fundamental parallels shown. The above dynastic jets are themselves "reflections" of empires of later origin (Roman-German Empire in 10-13th cc. A.D. and Third Byzantine Empire in 1204-1453 A.D.).
7. The Medieval Song of Roland and the Biblical Book of Joshua
7.1. History of the poem "Song of Roland"
The basic parallel making the biblical events coincident with the European ones is generated by the shift by c. 1,800 years (see the GCD). Since we do not have the space here, we are not able to give its full account. However, we illustrate it by one of the overlappings that occur. The following isomorphism I discovered while analyzing the medieval European literature devoted to the description of Charlemagne's Empire is very important. Described in a nutshell, it can be summed up by stating that the well-known European Song of Roland supplies the account of the same events as Chapters 7-10 of the Book of Joshua. This isomorphism remarkably confirms my Global Chronological Diagram (Figs. 65, 66). "Several editions of the poem have been preserved until today ... The most important of them is the so-called Oxford transcript dating from the mid-12th c. A.D. (a very late copy!-A. F.), regarded if not as just a recension, then, at any rate, very close to it. The incentive for creating the epic poem derived from the faraway events of 778 A.D. when Charlemagne involved himself in the interstine strife in Muslim Spain, along with and at the request of the friends of the Baghdad caliph Abdur Rahman, who decided to detach himself from the Abbasid caliphate and create an independent power. Having taken several cities, Charlemagne besieged Saragossa; however, he was forced to lift the siege after several weeks and to return across the Pyrenees because of internal trouble. Supported by the Moors, the Basques attacked the rear of Charlemagne's army and slaughtered the retreating Franks in the Roncesvalles pass" ([285], p. 19; see also the Russian edition). "The preserved chronicles of that time had long ignored (?!-A. F.) these events first reported by a chronicle in 829 A.D.... , i.e., fifty years afterwards. It is quite



The Medieval Song of Roland and the Biblical Book of Joshua 227
obvious (as it seems to the commentators-A. F.) that official chroniclers could be in no way interested in these so unpleasant confessions. It is also logical to suggest that the tales' event should have been retained fast in people's memory (?-A. F.), and the chroniclers could no more ignore the 'people's voice' ..." ([285*], pp. 19-20).
Modern commentators are forced to somehow interpret and explain the observed chronological gaps, though, insignificant in our case, being only half a century.
"The event fixed by history given in songs (as well as Homer's poems allegedly written only several centuries later-A. F.), and confirmed by Spanish chroniclers and Arabic historians, made up the basis for the Song of Roland preserved as a mid-12th-c. transcript whose unique authorship is ... ascribed to a certain fantastic Turoldus. All the evidence of the legend appeared later than the Oxford copy (12th c. A.D.!-A.F.) ... The spirit piercing the Song of Roland can be possibly explained, in the opinion of Bedier, only by the atmosphere of the Crusades, starting with the end of the 11th c. A.D. (whereas the Oxford transcript appeared in the 12th c. A.D., which is well consistent with this version-A. F.) ... ([285*], p. 20).
All the above-said ideally corresponds to the GCD, according to which the bulk of the information regarding "Charlemagne's Empire" came "from above", the 1013th-c. empire shifted downwards by 333 years. Due to the isomorphism below, the original of "Joshua's expeditions" therefore also arises from the epoch of the Crusade or even later.
"According to Bedier, Charlemagne was Christians' defendant and the spirit of the Crusades in person ..." (ibid.).
The clearly evangelical tone of the Song of Roland shows that the text was already made after Hildebrand's epoch, where the bulk of evangelical legends of Jesus Christ originated.
Certainly, traditional historians prefer the point of view that the described events occurred in the 9th c. A.D., and that all the "Crusade analogues" are "later insertions". We quote:
"The remoteness of the Oxford edition from the recension surely makes the reading of the Song of Roland quite difficult ... ([285*], p. 22).
"When the partisans of 'traditionalism' fought with Bedier's ideas, they seemed not to deny at all certain very clever observations regarding the intrusion into the poem of designs and spirit of the early 11th and late 12th cc. A.D. ... The most obvious proof of the influence of the ideology of the Crusades is the verbose episode with Baligant, the triumph of the Cross over the Crescent. The scene itself is clearly a later insertion (?-A. F.) contradicting the general scheme and stylistics of the poem" (ibid.).
It is important that
"Of all national eposes of the feudal Middle Ages, the most blooming and multiform is that of France (about 90 poems are preserved), the oldest dating from the 12th c. (i.e., transcripts of a very late origin!-A. F.), whereas the latest are dated by the 14th c. A.D .... The Song of Roland, the most famous of heroic French medieval poems, was preserved only in a few copies, and the following are the most important:



228 Enquete-Codes
1. Oxford copy. "This manuscript ... was made c. mid-12th c. A.D...." (ibid.).
2. Venetian manuscript of the 14th c. A.D. (ibid.).
3. All the other manuscripts are oflater origin ([285*], pp. 587-588).
"After oblivion having lasted for many centuries (!-A. F.), the Song of Roland was 'discovered' anew in the late 19th c. A.D. (!-A. F.), the epoch of Romanticism ... characteristically interested in everything medieval ..." ([285*], p. 588).
The first edition of the poem was made in 1837 (ibid.).
We now come to the description of the isomorphism.
7.2. The parallel between the medieval poem and the ancient chronicle. Table of the isomorphisms
The Book of Joshua
la. Joshua's and his army commanders' wars were described, all of them aggressive 2a. Crossing Jordan river, Israelites invaded foreign possessions, conquering new lands. Parallel to Roland's retreat, Book of Joshua described events occurring during Israelites' conquest of city Ai (Jos 7). Like Charlemagne, Joshua separated only small part of his main army for capturing Ai. "They (Joshua's menA.F.) returned to Joshua and reported that there was no need for the whole army to move: 'Let two or three thousand men go forward to attack Ai. Do not make the whole army toil up there; the population is small'" (Jos. 7:3)
3a. Detachment sent to capture Ai was defeated. "... the men of Ai, who killed some thirty-six of them; they chased (!-A.F.) them all the way from the gate to the Quarries and killed them on the pass. At this the courage of the people melted and flowed away like water" (Jos. 7:5)
The Song of Roland
lb. Charlemagne's and his army commanders' wars were described, all of them being mostly aggressive 2b. Charlemagne retreated from Spain, rear guard with Roland in command. It was not fleeing, but tactical manoeuvre of army chief temporally forced to stop invasion. Charlemagne's wars described as invasions. He came to foreign country, having left his own empire and made war on foreign soil, trying to join it to his own possessions. He separated part (rear) of his army and retreated. Roland headed 20,000 men ([285], LXIII), difference with left column being 1 order
3b. Army's rear guard was defeated: all (or almost all) knights perished in battle with enemy, who pursued (!) army's rear guard



The Medieval Song of Roland and the Biblical Book of Joshua 229
4a. "Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothes and flung themselves face downwards to the ground; they lay before the Ark of the Lord till evening ..." (Jos 7:6)
5a. Defeat of men sent to take Ai was direct consequence of "betrayal". Jericho had been taken before Ai; Joshua demanded that "the city shall be under solemn ban" , especially that valuables should be given to Lord. "... All the silver and gold, all the vessels of copper and iron, shall be holy; they belong to the Lord and they must go into the Lord's treasury" (Jos. 6:19). "But the Israelites defied the ban: Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the forbidden things, and the Lord was angry with the Israelites" (Jos 7:1). Infuriated, God allowed Ai's inhabitants to destroy Joshua's party (see above)
4b. Charlemagne's mourning after news about Roland's defeat. "Charles lies awake and weeps for Roland's plight. For Oliver he weeps with all his might. Weeps for his Twelve Peers, his French folk left behind in fight" ([285], 184, p. 147)
5b. Defeat of Roland's corps and army's rear guard was direct consequence of treachery: Count Ganelon (Guenes) came to terms with enemy and arranged for Charlemagne's leaving army's rear guard (insignificant in number) headed by best army commander, with Moors covertly attacking and killing Charlemagne's "Army Commander No. l". In both columns, catastrophe must be blamed on one man, a "traitor"
6a. "Traitor" violating Joshua's ban was 6b. Traitor was Ganelon
Achan (= KN if freed of vowels; possibly, part of "Ganelon")
7a. As can be gathered from Bible, Achan did not take part in party sent to take Ai. At any rate, Bible mentioned no word about it
8a. "Traitor's" death: Tried for defeat at Ai, Achan was executed (Jos 7:17-18, 25-26)
7b. Ganelon did not take part in rear guard's battle with Moors, and was placed near Charlemagne in his principal force
8b. Traitor's death: Charlemagne suspected Ganelon of being traitor and executed him ([285], 287)



230
9a. All Achan's relatives were executed, too. "Then Joshua took Achan ... together with his sons and daughters ... and everything he had ... up to the Vale of Achor ... Then all the Israelites stoned him to death; and they raised a great pile of stones over him ... (Jos 7:24-26)
10a. God told Joshua "they (peopleA. F.) must hallow themselves for tomorrow. Tell them (These are the words ofthe Lord, the God oflsrael): You have forbidden things (valuables stolen_.:._A. F.) among you, Israel ... In the morning come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe which the Lord chooses shall come forward family by family; and the family which the Lord chooses shall come forward man by man" (Jos 7:1314). "... and Achan ... was chosen" (Jos 7:18)
Enquete-Codes
9b. Thirty of Ganelon's associates were executed, too, trying to defend him against Charlemagne. "A hundred servants hale away the whole crew; Each of the thirty is hanged up in a noose. Threason destroys itself and others too" ([285], 288, p. 201)
10b. Traitor was discovered by God's intervention, who indicated him. To divert suspicion, Charlemagne ordered to fight two warriors, Charlemagne's and by name of Ganelon. Trial was held by God. "... Thierry lets drive a blow at Pinabel With that great stroke he wins and makes an end. The Franks all cry: 'God's might is manifest' Justice demands the rope for Guenes's (Ganelon's-A. F.) neck, And for his kinsmen who set their lives in pledge!' " ([285], 286, p. 200) Both texts on right and left ascribe traitor's discovery to God and not to accident
lla. Joshua's principal forces approached llb. Charlemagne's principal forces returned back and destroyed Moors' army, avenging them for destruction of army's rear guard ([285], 178-180). This battle with Moors was described as massacre in which Franks destroyed demoralized and fleeing Moors completely
Ai, and took it. "When the Israelites had cut down to the last man all the citizens of Ai who were in the open country or in the wilderness to which they had pursued them, and the massacre was complete, they all returned back to Ai and put it to the sword" (Jos 8:24)
12a. Joshua took Ai after this battle in 12b. Charlemagne took Saragossa after open country and in wilderness (Jos this battle and the one with Baligant 8:24-28)



The Medieval Song of Roland and the Biblical Book of Joshua 231
13a. During Joshua's battle with the group of kings rising against him after fall of Ai (which was described in subsequent 2 chapters), well-known biblical episode ofJoshua's stopping sun in order that it should shine on battle and let destroy enemy completely
13b. During Charlemagne's battle with Moors (already after Roland's defeat), well-known episode in Frankish history: Charlemagne's stopping sun in order that it should shine on battle and let destroy enemy completely
Here are the descriptions of these two famous episodes:
"On that day when the Lord delivered the Amorites into the hands of Israel, Joshua spoke with the Lord, and he said in the presence of Israel: Stand still, 0 Sun, in Gibeon; Stand, Moon, in the Vale of Aijalon. So the sun stood still and the moon halted until a nation had taken vengeance on its enemies, as indeed is written in the Book of J ashar. The sun stayed in mid heaven and made no haste to set for almost all day. Never before or since has there been such a day as this day on which the Lord listened to the voice of a man ..." (Jos 10:12-14)
14a. Sun was stopped during battle which Bible presents as "Joshua's vengeance" (see above) for defeat of part of his army
"In a green meadow he lights down on the sward, Kneels on the ground and prays to God Our Lord For Love of him to hold back the sun's course, Prolong the day and bid the dark withdraw. Straightway an angel with whom he wont to talk Comes, with this summons in answer to his call! 'Ride, Carlon, ride; the light shall not come short! The flower of France is fallen; God knows all; Thou shalt have vengeance upon the heathen horde' When this he hears, the Emperor gets to horse. For Charlemayn God wrought a wondrous token: The Paynims flee, the French pursue them closely. They overtake them in Vale of Tenebrosa. Towards Saragossa they drive and beat them broken... Charles sees all the Paynims dead ..." ([285], 179-181, pp. 145-146)
14b. Sun was stopped during battle which primary source presents as "Charlemagne's vengeance" for defeat of part of his army



232
15a. Whole Bible including both Old and New Testament has only one episode of "stopping sun"
Enquete-Codes
15b. As far as I know, this well-known episode is unique in Franks' history and in all medieval "knight-hood" literature
Thus, perfectly corresponding to the GCD, the two unique descriptions in the two chronological streams, viz., the European and biblical, were made coincident.
16a. After defeat of armies of Joshua's enemies, they all fled. "The five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah, and Joshua was told that they had been found in this cave" (Jos 10:16-17). Joshua's army captured this territory, cave was opened, kings let out. "And Joshua ... struck down the kings and slew them: then he hung their bodies on five trees ..." (Jos 10:26)
16b. After Saracen's (Moors') defeat, they fled, with strange episode of "grotto" occurring. Namely,
17a. Book of Joshua no longer speaks of 17b. any cave or grotto
18a. After these events, Book of Joshua 18b. described series of Joshua's battles with other kings, and Joshua's armies capturing many towns and regions, so-called Promised Land
"Marsile has fled to Saragossa town ... Queen Bramimond his spouse, Wails and laments and utters dismal sounds. By twenty thousand his followers stand around; They curse fair France and Carlon they denounce. Apollyon's grotto they make for it in a rout, With ugly insults they threaten him and shout: 'Aha! vile God, why must thou shame us now? Why let disaster befall this king of ours? ... They snatch away his sceptre and his crown, By his hands hang him upon a column bound, And with thick cudgels belabour him and pound; Then with their feet trample him on the ground. ... Into a ditch they boot away Mahoud ..." ([285], 187, pp. 149-150)
Song of Roland no longer speaks of any cave or grotto
Song of Roland described series of Charlemagne's grandiose battles in which he conquered many kings, and captured many towns and regions

8. The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology. The Gothic= Trojan= Tarquins' War(= GTR war) and Its Chronological Duplicates in the Different Epochs of Traditional History
8.1. The Trojan war and the Gothic and Tarquinian wars
1. The Medieval Trojan cycle. Homer, Dares and Dictys. We now come to the third basic rigid shift of c. 1,800 years, which we call Greco-biblical, because of its close relation to the history of Greece and the Bible. It is assumed that Troy fell in 1225 B.C. [39]. The first author, whose work was preserved after numerous copies, and who described the fall of Troy, was Homer, but his poems were completed {by copyists) only in the 8-7th cc., B.C. However, both of Homer's poems only surfaced in the late 14th c. A.D. [257]. Neverthless, "... by the 14th c. A.D., the diaries of the "participants of the Trojan war, Dictys and Dares, were put into wide circulation" ([250], p. 5). They are regarded as false participants because of their own evidence being in sharp contrast with traditional chronology, thereby indicating that the Trojan war had once been referred (erroneously, as we take it today) to the 3rd-4th cc. A.D. The Greek texts of Dares and Dictys were lost [107]. The first text (Latin) describing the Trojan war dates from the 6th c. A.D.: Some ignorant scribbler made up a dry and monotone account of the siege; it was very popular in the Middle Ages {[85], pp. 85-86). In this paragraph, we exhibit the evidence in support of the identification of the



234 Enquete-Codes
Trojan war with the 6th-c. war (cf. Gothic and Tarquinian wars). The shift is by c. 1,800 years.
Trojan war
la. Greatest event in Greek history: Victors destroyed Trojan kingdom (see below)
2a. First preserved medieval text describing war dates from 6th c. A.D. (though ascribed to 3rd-4th cc. A.D.)
Gothic and Tarquinian wars
lb. Greatest event in Greco-Roman history: Greeks (Romaic) destroyed Third Roman Empire and its last phase, Ostrogoths' kingdom
2b. Took place in mid-6th c. A.D. (at any rate, not earlier than 6th c. A.D.)
The historians' attitude towards Dares' and Dictys' texts is negative. e.g., "Two newly discovered 'genuine eye-witnesses' of the Trojan war were regarded as more important (in the Middle Ages-A. F.) than 'Homer's fabulous poem' (known only in 'fragments'-A. F.)" ([251], p. 45). "Many 19th-c. scientists denied the existence of the Greek manuscript (Dictys'A. F.), and believed that Lucius Septimius was the author of this famous falsification ... However, a fragment of Dictys' diary was discovered in Egyptian papyri in 1907 ..." (ibid.). It turns out that "Thucydides regarded the very Iliad as unreliable ..." (ibid.). The language of the Phrygian Dares' Latin texts ... "makes the classical philologists indignant ... the Greek original ... was not preserved" ([251], p. 45). The above texts, and, especially, that of the 6th c. A.D., generated very large numbers of works on the Trojan war (the so-called "Trojan cycle"). Note that the well-known 8-9th-c. poet Angilbert, also bearing the name of Homer, was working in Charlemagne's court (see above). It is important that the "classical" Homer, author of the Iliad and Odyssey, did mention Dares in his poems (at the beginning of Sec. V). Furthermore, Homer mentioned the Cretan king Idomeneus whose fellow fighter in the Trojan expedition was Dictys (ibid.). Dares was also mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid ([251], pp. 45-46). Following the traditional historians logic, we should make the conclusion that the "classical" Homer was writing not earlier than the 6th c. A.D. (because he was aware of Dares and Dictys); the same should be applied to Virgil, too. "For one thousand years until the very 17th c. A.D., Dares' and Dictys' fame elipsed that of Homer. Isidore of Seville regarded Dares as the first historian after Moses, and Herodotus' forerunner. In the 12th c. A.D., Dares, the Phrygian, became one of the most famous writers of antiquity (the "falsification" theory was advanced only in the 19th c. A.D.-A. F.)" ([251], p. 47). We constructed a graph demonstrating the distribution in time of the works of the Trojan cycle; it starts with the 6th c. (the century of the first preserved original text), and possesses an explicit maximum in the 12-13th cc. A.D. when especially many "Trojan legends" were written. We took the data from [107], [251]. As early as the 13th c., having retold the Trojan war according to Dares and Dictys, Joseph of Exeter insisted that



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 235
... "he had described authentic events, for Dares and Dictys had been their eyewitnesses" ([251), pp. 47-48).
From the late 12th c. and early 13th c. A.D., French poetry highly extolled the eternally glorious names of Ilium, Hector and Alexander. The trouveres of the cycle first of all took up the Trojan war; it was almost a national plot for them. In the 7th c. A.D., Fredegarius Scholasticus called Franceon, son of Priam, the first duke of the Franks [107]. This statement of a medieval author (and not only his) places the well-known king Priam (and the Trojan war in Priam's times) in the Middle Ages.
For a detailed analysis of the medieval Trojan cycle, we made use of one of the oldest and most popular primary sources of the 13th c. A.D. by Guido delle Calonne in the Russian translation of the early 16th c. A.D. Historia destructionis Troiae and Historia trojana (250]. They are actually identical with Homer's work, and differ only in providing less embellishment of the account, involvement of Gods in military action, moralistic fragments and less literary skill, with the medieval texts and especially those closer to the 6th c. A.D. being characterized by greater temperance and dryness.
Thus, there existed tradition referring the Trojan war to the 3rd-4th cc. ("imaginary" war), and the date of the first surviving description of the war to the 6th c. A.D.
Then Homer (= Angilbert?) appeared, and subsequently a multitude of novels "about Troy" followed, the most famous of which became the Iliad and the Odyssey in the 14-15th cc. A.D., ascribed to Homer.
The belief that the Franks had originated from Troy was widespread in the Middle Ages ([251), p. 45).
Homer's as well as Moses' and Solomon's times were spoken of. However, neither opponents nor fans read the work, the complete text appearing only in the 14th c. A.D. All that was known from the original Iliad was a short contraction ascribed to another person. But the works ascribed to Dares and Dictys were regarded as even better [107].
2. A rough comparison
la. Trojan war (TR-war in the following) was greatest event in Greek history
lb. Gothic-Tarquinian war (GTR-warin the following) was greatest event in Greco-Roman (Romaic) history
2a. There existed a Trojan kingdom 2b. There existed a Roman kingdom ((250), p. 70) (e.g., described by Livy) 3a. Troy was capital city (ibid.)
4a. Trojan kingdom was sacked in greatest war by Greek invaders (ibid.)
5a. Various indirect data refer TR-war to the Middle Ages (see above)
3b. Rome was capital city, and Naples big centre (also, Ravenna)
4b. Roman kingdom (Livy's "regal Rome") was destroyed by Greek Romaic invaders in greatest GTR-war
5b. Date for GTR-war is 6th c. A.D. (see above)

6a. There existed tradition to refer TRwar to 3rd-4th cc. A.O. ("imaginary" war; see above)
7a. Trojan kingdom is "covered" by 7 kings succeeding each other. First king founded City (Troy) and state (ibid.)
Sa. Sack of City and state took place under seventh king, kingdom was not restored any more ([250), p. 70; 198)
Enquete-Codes
6b. There existed tradition to refer GTRwar to 3rd c. A.O., it being copy of Gothic war, placed at end of Second Empire, i.e., before Third Empire (see above)
7b. Roman kingdom is "covered" by 7 kings succeeding each other in Western Empire in Italy (according to Livy). First king founded City (Rome) and state (see above)
Sb. City's destruction took place under last, seventh, king, and kingdom was not restored any more (see above)
To 8: Livy indicated the rule durations for 7 kings; the legends of the Trojan kingdom do not report the rule durations, only listing the rulers' names ([250), p. 70 and comm.).
9a. TR-war lasted for 10 or 11 years ([250), pp. 136)
9b. War with Tarquins lasted for 12 years (according to Livy, Bk. 2, 20), whereas Gothic war lasted for 16 years from 534 (or 536) to 552 A.O.
The two oldest versions, Trojan and Roman (according to Livy), are well consistent with each other, being 10 (or 11) and 12 years.
10a. Ilus was second Trojan king ([250], p. 198, Comm. 4). Ilus is the part of "Pomp-Ilus"
10b. Numa Pompilius was second king in Livy's "regal" Rome; he overlaps with Julius (see above)
The names Ilus and Julius are very close.
lla. KingOardanusisregardedasfounder llb. Foundation in 330 A.O. of city New of Troy and dynasty (kingdom) ac- Rome (Constantinople), on Bosphocording to certain data (ibid.) rus, with Oardanelles nearby, took place at start of "regal" Rome, i.e., Third Empire
To 11: the foundation of the two Romes, in Italy and New Rome in 330 A.O., is placed at the start of "regal" Rome according to traditional chronology (Livy also spoke of the foundation of the two capitals by Romulus and Remus in Bk. 1 of his History of Rome). It is assumed by Greek mythology that the Oardanelles' name originated just from the king Oardanus.



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 237
12a. Certain chronicles called king Dardanus founder of kingdom and City, whereas others attributed this to king Pridesh. Thus, at beginning of Trojan kingdom, there is confusion between two founders (of two cities?)
13a. Kingdom and city created were called by founders name (king Pridesh according to certain chronicles) (ibid.)
12b. Speaking of foundation of kingdom and city, Livy also mentioned two founders of two cities, Romulus and Remus, each of whom founded one capital city, but then Romulus killed Remus and destroyed his capital. Thus there are two founders of two cities in Livy's regal Rome 13b. Kingdom created bore name of city's and state's founder Romulus, being Roman one
To 13a: "The king liked this spot, and he founded here a city, calling it by his own name" ([250], p. 70).
This name is not at all Troy (see below). We will speak of the First Kingdom (Dardanus' or Pridesh's), which was destroyed when sacked for the first time (see below).
14a. In Trojan kingdom's history, socalled first sack ofTroy under Laomedon, king Priam's father, was fixed along with last and principal sack, which we will call second ([250], p. 89)
14b. In Roman kingdom's Western Third Empire's history, destruction under Romulus Augustulus was fixed along with last and major destruction, which we will call second (see below)
To 14b: We mean the fall of the "purely Roman" kingdom under Romulus Augustulus (Italy's capture by Odoacer), it being the first destruction, whereas the second took place already after the Gothic war.
15a. These are only two major sacks, second being final, fixed in Trojan kingdom's history (ibid.)
15b. These are only two major destructions, second being final, fixed m Empire's history (see above)
16a. First sack marked that of so-called 16b. First destruction marked that of 1st Trojan kingdom (Dardanus' or Pridesh's; see above) (ibid.), after which so-called Second Trojan kingdom under king Priam arose for short time, around one generation (ibid.)
17a. Invaders who destroyed First Trojan kingdom came from West. "The invaders from the West took ... the city" (ibid.)
"purely Roman" Western Third Empire, its last kings Odoacer and Theodoric not being Roman (see above), after which Second kingdom, of Ostrogoths under Theodoric, arose for short time, around one generation
17b. Invaders who destroyed first "purely Roman kingdom" came to Italy from northwest
18a. There were two invaders: Jason and 18b. There were two invaders: Odoacer Hercules (ibid.) and Theodoric (see above)

19a. Kingdom changed its name after 19b. first sack ([250], p. 70)
Western Empire changed its name after first destruction; kingdom of Ostrogoths was founded (see above)
20a. At end of kingdom, its name was replaced by new one, related to term "Trojan"(= TRN if freed of vowels; ibid.; cf. Franks = TRN) 21a. Term "Trojan" is related to new king Troilus' name, who "built in the city more than others, and gives it his name Troy" (ibid.)
22a. King Troilus was sixth among Trojan kings according to Trojan legends (according to other data, it was Laomedon) (ibid.)
23a. King Troilus (or Laomedon) founded kingdom with new name "Trojan". First invasion took place during his rule (ibid. et seq.)
24a. New term "Trojan" appeared at end of TR-kingdom (see above), being very close to Trajan
20b. At end of Western Third Empire, term "Tarquin" (= TRQN if freed of vowels) appeared (according to Livy)
21b. Term Tarquins (= TRQN) is related to new king Tarquinius' name (see overlapping above: Tarquinius Priscus = Valentinian III and Ricimer, whereas Tarquinius the Proud = Goths)
22b. Servius Tullius, Odoacer's and Theodoric's analogue, was Livy's sixth king in "regal" Rome
23b. Servius Tullius (= Odoacer and Theodoric) founded new German Gothic kingdom in 476-552 A.D. (see above). It was Odoacer (and Theodoric) who headed first invasion destroying 1st, purely Roman, "kingdom"
24b. New name; Emperor Trajan ruling in 98-117 A.D. appeared at end of Second Empire, isomorphic to end of Third Empire (see above)
To 24b: Trajan was a well-known ruler of the Second Empire, overlapping with Arcadius under the isomorphism of the Second and Third Empires in 395-408 A.D. Arcadius' (= Trajan's) rule is placed in immediate vicinity of Tarquinius Superbus reigning in 437-472 (see above). Thus, the terms "Trajan" and "Tarquin" are practically overlapping under the isomorphisms known to us earlier, viz., Second Empire = Third Empire = Livy's "regal" Rome, which indicates that the "Trojans" and "Tarquins" are identified.
25a. So-called "Trojan" period in Trojan 25b. So-called "Tarquinian" period in kingdom's history Roman kingdom's history (in Italy)
These two time intervals are well consistent. The consistency will become ideal if we assume that the term "Tarquinius Superbus" = Trajan should be applied to Odoacer = Theodoric, and not to Valentinian III = Ricimer. It is possible that Livy interchanged the names of two neighbouring kings.



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 239
26a. Adjective "Trojan" when applied to 26b. "Tarquin" has form TRQN if freed Trojan war, in Greek, has forms of vowels, whereas term "Franks" is TRN, TRK (or TRKV), TRV if TRNK freed of vowels
Collecting all the left Greek terms freed of vowels together, we obtain TRKVN,
a collective term precisely coinciding with the TRQN (= Tarquins), which is not accidental.
To 26a: rpowvoc;, rpoo:xoc;, rpou:vc;.
Recall that, according to the medieval Franks, they originate from Troy, though, in modern traditional history, the attitude towards this medieval point of view is negative, with this legend now being regarded as prestigiously nationalistic. Taking into account the earlier-known identifications, we cannot but pay attention to the Franks' origin from the Trojans, as pointed out also by their name TRNK ("F" is
often transformed into "T"); therefore, the Franks = TRNK, and the Trojans = TRN, TRK (i.e., TRNK, TRQN) are, in fact, denoted by almost identical terms.
27a. TRKVN (= Trojans)lost in TR-war 27b. TRQN (= Tarquins) lost in GTRwar
We conjecture that the Goths = Tarquins = Trojans spread in all directions, driven from Italy by the piston of the GTR-war after they had been driven out of Italy in the 6th c. A.O. One wave of the fugitives came after some time to the Bosphorus, founding there New Rome instead of the "old" Italian Rome, another branch went to Asia Minor where they founded New Jerusalem at El Kuds, "dragging" along their old geographic maps and names, and still another branch came to the Crimea and founded T'ma-Tarakan' there.
28a. Second and last sack of kingdom was carried out by invading Greeks at end ofTRKVN-period in kingdom's history
29a. Chronicles noted great fleet on which Greek conquerors arrived in Trojan kingdom. Even number of ships was indicated ([250], p. 95 et seq)
30a. During second invasion, conquerors' fleet arrived from Greece [250]
31a. Troy is seaside city ([250], p. 70)
32a. River flowed through Troy, TRKVNkingdom's capital (see above) [250]
28b. Second and last destruction of Western Third Empire was carried out by invading Greeks (Romaic) at end of TRQN-period in kingdom's history
29b. Chronicles noted great fleet on which (Romaic) Greek conquerors arrived in Roman kingdom of Tarquins in 535 A.D. [44]
30b. During second invasion, conquerors' fleet arrived from Byzantine Empire (Greece) (ibid.) 31b. Rome and Naples were seaside cities
32b. River Tiber flowed through Rome, TRQN-kingdom's capital

To 34b.: These windmills played a great role in the 6th-c. GTR-war, the battles between the Goths and Romans and the Romaic Greeks repeatedly taking place around them [44]. Procopius paid these "windmill battles" much attention [109]. No other descriptions of wars by the Third Empire contain mentions of the Tiber's windmills.
35a. Troy was Trojan kingdom's capital. 35b. Many spots in Rome and around King Troilus (giving Troy his name) it, capital of TRQN-kingdom, are was identified with emperor Trajan related to emperor Trajan's name, (see above). Second Trojan king- who built well-known harbours and dom's army consisted of "Trojans" ports, and also canal. Bodyguard
Trajan (=TRN) served in Belisarius' army [109]

Phrygia =Friesland? were called Frisians, and Germany Friesland ([250], p. 216)
To 37a: Before the first invasion of Troy, Jason and Hercules "moored to the shores of the Phrygian land, Trojan kingdom" ([250], p. 79).
According to the commentators,
"... the Trojan kingdom abutted on the Phrygian land" ([250], p. 209).
(The proximity of Troy and Phrygia or Troy's being positioned in the Phrygian region is mentioned [250], pp. 101, 100.) The author of the popular book about Troy (see above), Dares of Phrygia, participant in the war, bore the name of a Phrygian. "Furthermore, the medieval authors regarded Phrygia as a land in which the Trojan kingdom was situated" ([250], p. 214, Comm. 71).
According to the modern map, Phrygia is a region in Asia Minor. But the medieval authors localized it differently.



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 241
To 37b:
"Apparently, the reading of certain transcripts by Guido delle Colonne (of the 13th c. A.D.-A. F.) where Friesland was mentioned is more correct. The tribes inhabiting the northwest of Germany have been called Frisians since the start of the Christian era" ([250], p. 216, Comm. 99).
This automatically places the Trojan kingdom into Italy.
38a. "The Phrygians (Frisians-A. F.) 38b. During GTR-war with Romans = were the Trojans' allies (in the Tro- (Romaic) Greeks, both Goths and
jan war-A. F.)" ([250], p. 216, Germanic tribes (= TRQN) took Comm. 99). Due to medieval data, part in GTR-war; Odoacer was GerGermans were Trojans' allies (see man, and Theodoric Goth. They above) were allies: Frisians and Trojans
(= TRQN). Recall that Tarquinius the Proud (Goths' analogue) was invader, and Tarquins were "people from Northern Land"
Homer called Dares a priest in Troy (Ilium), which again indicates that Dares the Phrygian, who took part in the war, was Trojan's ally (V, 9-11).
It is probable that after the "exodus" of the Goths = Tarquins = Trojans from Italy, the geographic names were also "transferred". The fugitives who came to the Near East and founded New Jerusalem in place of the old one in Italy (Pompeii
or Rome, or New Rome) "dragged" also Friesland = Germany along with them, which automatically overlapped with modern Phrygia in Asia Minor when the map was shifted east. Therefore, Troy, which H. Schliemann was looking for here, also "went" to Asia Minor. This process of transferring geographic names from the West to the East could have occurred during the Crusades when the Europeans moved east. That Dares was Phrygian (see above) means that the first surviving legends
of the fall of Troy were written in the 6th c. A.D. by the Germans and Goths = Trojans who took part in the war. Thus, we lift the charge of falsifying Dares from Phrygia (and also Dictys).
The modern historians protest against the medieval authors' directly calling the Frisians (Germans) the participants in the Trojan war: "without doubt, the Frisians could not have taken part in the Trojan war" ([250], p. 216, Comm. 99).
39a. A Mt. Ida is situated near Troy 39b. Mt. Vesuvius is situated near Naples [140]; ([250], p. 198). Term "Ida" is (and not far from Rome). Due to dyclose to "Judaean" nastic isomorphisms (see above), this is Judaean, or God-praising, mountain



242
40a. "Trojan cycle" (in particular, Ho- 40b. mer's) often mentions "crest" of Ida "Zeus of Ida", "Ida's forest". (Besides, Minor India is situated near Mt. Ida.) ([140]; [250], p. 93, p. 212, Comm. 50)
Enquete-Codes
Since Third Empire's history is also reflected in J udaean chronicles, all terms in left column are associated with "Judaean mountain crest", "Zeus Judaean", "Judaean forest", etc. It is possible that Judaea (as well as Israel) was originally placed in Italy, and "moved" to the East only after Goths' "exodus" from Italy
To 40b: It is possible that the name "Ravenna" originated from "Rabbi", meaning Rabbi's city and, possibly, indicating that Israel and Judaea were originally placed near each other, as is described in the Bible, in Italy, with Judaea being east of Israel.
According to the Trojan chronicles, Mt. Ida (as well as Vesuvius) turns out to be a centre of religious worship (e.g., the so-called Paris' judgement). Finding himself in "Ida's forest", Paris solves the dispute between three goddesses, handing the prize Aphrodite, the goddess oflove ([250], p. 93). Since the Bible often identifies "wives" with religions, the choice of a bacchanalian religion probably is meant here, it being consecrated by Vesuvius' volcanic cult as the Trojans' state religion (recall that Paris was a Trojan king's son; see also above where we pointed out the bacchanalian Christian Roman cult prior to Hildebrand= Jesus).
After the fall of Troy, Trojans go "west of the sun", and found the city Venetia ([250], p. 147). Probably, this means the foundation of Venice, which again places the Trojan kingdom into Italy. Recall that Venice = Venetia (= ancient Phoenicia).
41a. According to traditional chronology, 41b. Troy fell in 1255 B.C. [39]. Capital of Hittite country fell approximately at that moment, as well as Babylon
Previous investigations identify Hittite kingdom with country of Goths, and Babylon with Rome (at least, in certain chronicles)
To 41: Thus, in traditional chronology, the fall of Troy, of Babylon(= Rome) and of Hattusas (capital of Hittites = Goths) overlap, which is fully consistent with new chronology and earlier identifications.
42a. War in Trojan kingdom began be- 42b. cause of a woman, and "Helen's insult" was reason for it [250]
War in Roman (Gothic-Tarquinian) kingdom began because of a woman, "and Lucretia(= Amalasuntha) was reason for it (see above)
These two legends of "insulting a woman" are practically identical (see below).



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 243
43a. "Trojan cycle" distinguishes 11 great 43b. battles separated into large number of smaller military conflicts
Describing GTR-war, Procopius counted tens of battles. Livy also described large number of battles grouped into two large episodes 44a. TR-war ended in fall and sack of cap- 44b. GTR-war led to marauding of Rome ital. Winners' atrocities and "sack of and Naples, and its citizens were the city up to the foundation" were massacred [44], ([44*], V. 1, p. 326) mentioned (ibid.)
45a. Greeks were responsible for sack of 45b. Medieval authors supply different Troy, and put whole town to fire replies to question ofwho was respon(ibid.) sible for sacking Rome and Naples, most authoritative version putting responsibility on Greeks (ibid.)
To 45b: According to F. Gregorovius, Rome fell victim to the siege and Greek usury ... The whole of Italy was covered with dead bodies and ruins of buildings from the Alps to Tarentum; hunger and plague followed the war and turned the country into a desert. At least one-third of the population died. The ancient forms oflife both in Rome and the whole of Italy were destroyed by the Gothic war forever. The night of barbarism clothed the destroyed Latin world in darkness ([44], V. 1).

To 46.8a: Different versions of the "Trojan cycle" treat the abduction of Helen somewhat differently. According to some, she gave herself to Paris willingly, and, according to the others, reluctantly ([250), p. 72).
"Paris himself grabbed queen Helen ... leaving her guarded on the ship" ([250), p. 96).
To 46.8b: Amalasuntha (= Lucretia) was taken to the island reluctantly (see above).
46.9a. Helen's murder (according to certain versions of "Trojan cycle"; see below)
46.9b. Lucretia's suicide. Amalasuntha and Julia Maesa murdered (see above)
To 46.9a: Helen's death had already occurred after the fall of Troy:
"... and ordered to behead Helen and Farizh (= Paris-A. F.)" ([250), p. 76).
"The tale of Helen's and Paris' execution ordered by Menelaus diverges from the so-called ancient version" ([250), p. 207).

46.12a. Helen's rape caused Trojan war, "vengeance for Helen" official slogan of TR-war (ibid.)
46.12b. Lucretia's rape caused war with Tarquins, "vengeance for Lucretia" ([174), Bk. 2, 1-2), official pretext for GTR-war according to Livy
Because of the isomorphism: Lucretia= Amalasuntha (see above), we could also investigate the isomorphism Helen = Amalasuntha. Briefly, Amalasuntha was killed (like Helen); she was possibly taken to an island (like Helen) into a "strong fortification" ([109), Bk. V, 14-15), analogue of "fortified Troy". It was just Amalasuntha's death that had caused the Gothis war (ibid.). Amalasuntha's "violator" Theodahad was soon killed (like Paris, Helen's "violator").

47a. Greeks' talks with Trojans about Helen's fate, and Trojans' refusal to give Helen back [250]. Greeks declared war
48a. Greek fleet commanded by Achilles arrived at Trojan kingdom's shore ([250], p. 72)
49a. Chronicle especially distinguishes Achilles, most famous Greek army commander, hero of this war, among numerous heroes of Greek army
50a. Two "principal" kings Agamemnon and Menelaus, Helen's husband, arrived at Trojan kingdom together with Achilles, who was appointed commander of whole army (ibid.)
51a. "Principal" kings Agamemnon and Menelaus took insignificant part in military action compared with Achilles shouldering all responsibility, and being subordinate to them ([250], p. 72, et seq.)
52a. Arriving at Trojan kingdom's shore, Greek fleet took island Tenedos (which was in Trojans' hands ([250], p. 100) 53a. Suppressing Trojans' resistance, Greeks occupied Tenedos, thus invading Trojan kingdom (ibid.)
54a. For several months, Greeks stayed in captured Tenedos ([250], pp. 101103)
47b. (Romaic) Greeks' talks with Goths
(= TRQN) about Amalasuntha's fate (who was carried away to island; see above). Amalasuntha's murder by Goths. Greeks declared war [44]
48b. Greek fleet commanded by Belisarius arrived at Italian shore at end of 535 A.D. (ibid.)
49b. "To carry out this plan of driving Goths out, fate made Justinian gift of one of greatest army commanders, Belisarius" (ibid.)
50b. Belisarius was appointed army commander by emperor Justinian, "principal" Greek king ([44])
51b. "Principal" king Justinian did not take direct part in military action, staying far from war theatre (ibid.). Subordinate Belisarius shouldered whole burden
52b. Arriving at Italian shore, Greek fleet captured island Sicily at end of 535 A.D. [44], which was in
Goths' (= TRQN) hands
53b. Suppressing Goths' resistance, Greeks occupied Sicily, thus invading Italy (ibid.)
54b. For several months, from end of 535 to summer of 536 A.O., Greeks stayed in captured Sicily (ibid.)
To 54a: For these several months, the Greeks exchanged ambassadors with Troy, sent part of their army to the adjacent country for bread with which they provided themselves in fighting; suppressing the enemy, they returned to Tenedos ([250], pp. 101-103).

55a. Then Greeks came to Trojan kingdom (mainland) and started besieging Troy. This is title of section in medieval chronicle: "How the Greeks left the island of Tenedos, and started besieging Troy" ((250], pp. 103-104)
56a. Troy's siege started. All chronicles in "Trojan cycle" characterized Troy as extremely powerful fortress situated at seaside. Legends circulated about Troy's impregnability; in particular, Gods themselves defended Troy against enemy. "And God ordered to encircle the city with powerful walls as high as two hundred cubits ([250], p. 90) 57a. We have listed all principal events at beginning of war. Then Troy's siege and fall
Enquete-Codes
55b. Then Greeks came to Italy, and Belisarius' land forces and fleet moved along shore to be soon contained by Naples' heroic resistance [44], [109]
56b. Naples' siege started. Sixth-c. historians described it as extremely powerful seaside fortress. Legends were made about Naples' impregnability; Gods themselves allegedly chose rocky foundation, with no chance of undermining its powerful walls, and Naples was situated at seaside ([44*], p. 326, et seq.)
57b. We have listed all principal events at start of war. Naple's siege and fall
The difference between the fall of Troy in the "Trojan cycle" and the Gothic version is that the former was referred to at the very end of the war, whereas, in the latter, it occurred at the beginning. At the same time, the Trojan kingdom's fall coincides with that of the Romans. The description of the Gothic version is more particular, with Naples' and Rome's sieges being different, while the Trojan version combined them into one siege of Troy. Transferring Naples' fall to the end of the war leads to a 9- or 10-year-long difference, which is negligibly small, compared with the general antiquity of the events.
4. The fall of Naples and Troy
58a. Troy's fall 58b. Naples' fall
58.la. Unsuccessful siege preceded. Sev- 58.lb. Unsuccessful siege preceded. Several attacks failed. Greek army eral attacks failed. Greek army commanded by Achilles was de- commanded by Belisarius was defeated ([250], p. 70 et seq.) feated. Greeks were even going to leave Naples (44]
58.2a. During Troy's siege, conspiracy 58.2b. aimed at opening city to Greeks was organized, its leaders being Trojans Aeneas and Antenor ([250], p. 131)
During Naple's (or Rome's) siege, conspiracy aimed at opening city to Greeks arose, its leader being a Neapolitan Stephan. Great conspiracy in Rome during its siege was described by Procopius (ibid.)



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 247
58.3a. Conspirators' personal talks with Greeks and their embassy (ibid.). Title of one of sections of "Trojan cycle" was: "On the peace talks and betrayal in Troy" ([250], p. 132). Greeks' promise to Trojan traitors that their houses "will be spared" (ibid.). Troy's capture not related to this conspiracy (according to certain versions)
58.3b. Gothic version spoke of conspiracy in more vague terms; however, Roman conspiracy during its siege was described in more detail (ibid.). Neapolitan Stephan also allegedly held long personal talks with Greeks with no definite result. Naples captured with no relation to this plot
5. The Greeks' Trojan horse and the Latins' aqueduct of Naples
58.4a. For taking Troy, non-trivial trick 58.4b. For taking Naples, non-trivial trick was employed (ibid.) was employed (ibid.)
58.5a. "A sort of grey horse" was used 58.5b. Aqueduct, sort of "grey horse", ([250], p. 76) was used (ibid.)
To 58.b: Belisarius applied the cunning lucky trick that had accidentally occurred to him; it turned out that an enormous pipe (precisely a pipe, and not a chute) penetrated into Naples, starting outside the city and leading to it through the powerful fortress walls on an old, half-destroyed aqueduct with an opening on the wall level covered with a stone having a small hole to let water out. A special detachment of Belisarius' warriors comprising several hundred men penetrated into the pipe, destroyed the cover, and succeeded to be in Naples at night. Early in the morning, the soldiers came out of the aqueduct, signalled the principal troops outside, opened the gate, and Belisarius' armies stormed into the city. Procopius (see [109]) described the aqueduct as an enormous pipe in which a man could stand undisturbed, and which was supported by heavy legs [44], [109]. To 58a (see [250]): "And the Magi announced that it was impossible to occupy Troy in fight, and it could only be done by trickery. And then the Greeks built a wooden horse (?-A. F.) of unheard-of size (cf. aqueduct-A. F.), and hid the brave warriors in its maw ... The Trojans decided to drag the horse into the city (?-A. F.) ... having dragged the horse along, they indulged in sumptuous feasts ... and then went to sleep. The warriors hidden in the horse, however, covertly came out, and started putting the Trojans' houses on fire ... Through the gate opened by the Greeks already in Troy, ... innumerable Greek soldiers rushed. Thus fell the strong-towered Troy. And it was said in other books that a sort of grey horse (i.e., not a horse, but only its "similarity" (!) possibly, meaning a grey stone aqueduct-A. F.) was erected of glass, copper and wax (later authors' fantasy-A. F.), inside which three hundred armed knights had been hidden" ([250], p. 76). Another version: "And they (Greeks-A. F.) erected an enormous copper horse in whose maw up

to one thousand warriors could be placed. Secret doors were made in its side" ([250], pp. 132-133).
58.6a. "Sort of grey horse" (only "similarity" to horse!) was made use of ([250], p. 76). Enormous size "similar" to horse was stressed. Several hundred warriors could be placed inside. Horse stood on enormous legs. According to certain versions, "horse was wooden, and allegedly came into the city" (was "dragged") (ibid.)
58.7a. Idea to resort to "similarity" of horse to capture Troy was expressed by "Greek Ulysses" (who was identified with Odysseus), probably being the very Achilles (Ulysses being another form of "Achilles" due to phonetic analogy of names) (ibid.)
58.8a. "Breakthrough" group was hidden inside "sort of grey horse" (ibid.), operation carried out secretly and kept from Trojans
58.9a. "Breakthrough" group made up of 300 or 1,000 people (see various versions above and ibid.) came into "sort of horse" beyond city walls (entrance to "horse" was outside Troy) (ibid.)
58.6b. Half-destroyed aqueduct, enormous pipe on leg supports was mentioned (Fig. 106); (see photographs ofpreserved ancient Italian aqueducts in [44]). Ancient authors could have also compared aqueduct with enormous horselike animal which, "striding" on its supports, came into city to supply water. It is not accidental that supports of modern bridges across rivers are sometimes called piers, probably, echoing ancient idea of "striding" aqueducts. Since aqueduct was half-destroyed, its similarity to animal could become especially enhanced
58.7b. Idea to resort to aqueduct for capturing Naples was realized by Belisarius (ibid.). Due to previous isomorphisms, Belisarius coincides with Achilles(= Ulysses), this identification of legends of Belisarius and Achilles will essentially be completed below
58.8b. "Breakthrough" group was hidden inside aqueduct - water pipe ([44], [109]), operation kept secret from Neapolitans(= Goths); moreover, it was also kept secret from Belisarius' main forces [109]
58.9b. "Breakthrough" group comprising 400 men came into aqueduct through hole placed outside city walls ([44], [109]). According to certain legends, they came with horses, which gives us once again "aqueduct" with "horse"



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 249
58.l0a. "Breakthrough" group'scomman- 58.l0b. Zeno, Belisarius' cavalry comder was called Sinon (or Zeno) mander, could be leader of "break([250], pp. 132-133). He was "... through" group (again "Zeno" given the keys by the Greeks, appears in relation to "horse"), and ordered to open the secret whereas its commanders were callexit out of the horse's maw at the ed Magnus and Enn [44], [109] stipulated moment" (ibid.)
To 58.lOb: Sinon (in the form of Zeno) was one of the most important participants in the Gothic war, commander of Belisarius' cavalry along with Magnus ([109], II (V), 5, 2; 6, 13), i.e., Sinon-Zeno could, and even had to, take part in the attack on Naples. The historian V. D. Ivanov, who studied the Gothic war directly, pointed out that the man discovering the pass in the aqueduct as was Zeno. Unfortunately, we could not find any ancient chronicles with precise data. Besides, the authors of the "Trojan cycle" sometimes replaced "g" by "s" (cf. Phrygia-Friesland), and then "Magnus" (breakthrough group's commander) could become "Masnus", which is, possibly, somehow related to "Zeno" (= ZN). Though, it is possible that Procopius'
Enn, a second breakthrough group's commander, just was Sinon (= SNN). We stress once again that the participation in the breakthrough group of a commander of the cavalry could also prompt the comparison of the aqueduct to a horse.
58.lla. Sinon (or Zeno) thereby "found 58.llb. Gothic "Zeno" also was in Naples himself" in Troy, penetrating it long before general attack on city, some time before general attack but only as hostage ([109], II (VI), [250] 7, 13)
58.12a. Trojanfortress'wallwasdestroyed 58.12b. Naples' city wall was destroyed due to necessity of "dragging sort inside aqueduct to let warriors of grey horse" inside (ibid.). All into city. Belisarius' warriors Trojan chronicles unanimously chipped off stone cover of tunspoke of some destruction just nel's entrace to Naples, placed when "sort of horse came into at wall level, thereby destroying the city" wall ([41], [109], p. 368; see also Appendix 1, Fig. 96)
To 58.12a: This "destruction of the wall" was described by different authors differently, with some speaking of "dismantling the gate" ([250], p. 76), and others of "... necessity to destroy part of the wall, thus making it possible for the Greeks who returned to Troy to storm into the city" ([250], pp. 206-207, Comm. 53).
Still others speak of "a sort of horse" with one ear having been chopped off(?). Another version: "to let the horse into the city", "the stone crowning the gate was thrown off" (ibid.). We believe that all the versions echo the episode when Belisarius' men hidden in the aqueduct pipe gauged the stone stopper [109].

58.13a. "Breakthrough" group came out 58.13b. "Breakthrough" group came out of "sort of grey horse" through ofaqueduct, already inside Naples, secret entrance in horse's maw through secret opening, breach in ([250], p. 132) aqueduct not visible from ground [109]
58.14a. "Breakthrough" group came out of "sort of horse" late at night ([250], p. 133)
58.14b. Breakthrough group came out of aqueduct late at night (ibid.)
58.15a. General attack and Troy's fall 58.15b. General attack and Naples' fall occurred early in morning, mainly occurred early in morning, mainly due to support of "breakthrough" due to breakthrough group from group (ibid.) inside (ibid.)
58.16a. "Horse" in Latin is equa, equus 58.16b. "Water" in Latin is aqua
To 58.16: Thus, "water" and "horse" are written almost identically (recall that the events occurred in Italy near Rome). Furthermore, "aqueduct" in Latin is aquae ductus, which is almost identical to the term "horse conducting", in Latin equiductus. The words are written and sound (!) almost identically, the difference being only in one vowel. "Water-pipe ward" and "horseman" are also almost identical (cf. also aqualicu]us meaning stomach, belly, abdominal cavity, maw). Recall the warriors in the Trojan horse's maw. It is probable that the Trojan version is later than the Roman; therefore, the "water-pipe" was turned into the "horse" by foreign authors who mixed up one vowel, which generated the legend of "an enormous similarity to a grey horse". A certain ancient version of "the horse legend", by the way, spoke of the "horse" having been dragged nowhere, which is natural due to the stability of the aqueduct, and of the warriors "coming out secretly". These transformations of words are not surprising. The "Literaturnaya gazeta' in its October 20 and December 8, 1982, issues published some articles demonstrating how strongly the names of our contemporaries, and different terms can be distorted when translating them into foreign languages. And this occurs in an age of widespread dictionaries, etc.! What can be expected of ancient chroniclers infinitely confused by the spellings of unknown words, names!
6. Achilles and Patrodus = Valerius and Brutus
59a. Achilles was principal commander of Greek armies, and one of most popular heroes of old Greek epos. His name contains combination LS
59b. Belisarius was principal commander of Greek troops, and one ofmost popular heroes of ancient Roman and Greek epos. His name contains combination LS
To 59b: This siege is one of the most remarkable in history and resembles a heroic epic. "Procopius (without our prompting-A. F.) has borrowed the colours of the Iliad to describe the first furious struggle before the walls of Rome. He shows us Belisarius



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 251
... foremost in the fight (similar to Homer's Achilles-A. F.)" ([44], p. 377).

61b. Belisarius-Valerius (= Valerius; cf. GTR-war), who commanded Greco-Roman army, had closest comradein-arms and friend Brutus (= Proectus = PRCT = BRT)
The names BRT on the left and right coincide. To 61a: "Patroclus" = PTRCL if freed of vowels. Along with the form "Patroclus", the Trojan chroniclers often used the form Partasis ([250], p. 143), i.e., PRTS, or BRTS, but the latter can as well take the form "Brutus", if supplied with vowels, i.e., just what was employed by Livy (see above). To 61b: Cf. Brutus being placed over Proectus under the isomorphism "GothicTarquinian war" .
62a. These two brothers-in-arms were engaged in war from its very beginning [250]
63a. Patroclus (= BRT, Brutus) had been killed earlier than Achilles died ([250], pp. 108-111), and was second most important after Achilles in Greek army ([250], p. 108)

71b. Brutus'(= BRT) body was buried by army commander Valerius (= Belisarius) himself
72b. Brutus (= BRT) avenged insulted Lucretia (ibid.)
To 71b: Livy: Valerius buried his friend Brutus with all the solemnity possible for the time. However, much more honourable for the perished was the public mourning, which was especially remarkable, because the matrons were weeping over him as their father for one year, he being so stern an avenger for the insulted honour ([174], Bk. II, 7).
7. Achilles and Hector= Belisarius and Vitiges
73a. First phase of TR-war was characterized by fierce fighting of outstanding principal army commanders, Greek Achilles and Trojan (= TRKVN) Hector [250]
74a. Name "Hector" is often used in form of Victor in Trojan cycle ([250], pp. 11, 74; 204, Comm. 38), which is VCTR if freed of vowels
73b. First phase of GTR-war was characterized by fierce fighting between two outstanding principal army commanders, Romaic Greek Valerius (= Belisarius) and Goth (= TRQN) Vitiges = Aruns [109], [174]
74b. In Goths version, Hector's (= Victor) analogue is Vitiges = VTGS if freed of vowels, which is close to VCTR 75a. Victor(= Hector) was king and son 75b. Vitiges (= Aruns) was king and son of king (ibid., p. 73) of king [109], [174]



The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 253
To 75: Vitiges was king of the Goths [109].
"King Hector, son of Priam ..." ([250], p. 73).
The formal (principal) king according to the Trojan version was the old Priam, but he did not take part in the battle:
"The ancient sources said nothing of Priam's participation in the battles, he being an old man ..." ([250], p. 217, Comm. 112).
76a. Victor (= Hector) was TRKVN
army commander in first phase of war until his death, and Troj ans' principal hero who appointed and dismissed army commanders in Trojan army (ibid.)
77a. Victor (= Hector) was Trojan (TRQN)

79a. Victor (= Hector) had died earlier than Achilles, his principal enemy (ibid.)
80a. Victor (= Hector) was killed by Achilles (ibid.)
81a. Victor (= Hector) killed Patroclus (= BRT), which, together with accompanying circumstances, is completely isomorphic to "Gothic-Tarquinian version" (see above)
82a. Victor (=Hector) was killed in single combat during cavalry battle, by Achilles (ibid.)
76b. Vitiges (= Aruns) was king and TRQN army commander in first phase of GTR-war until his death, and principal figure who appointed and dismissed Gothic army commanders [44], [109]
77b. Vitiges (= Aruns) was Goth (= Tarquin = TRQN)
78b. Gothic-Tarquin's dynasty TRQN (Trojans' analogue; see above) ruled in Rome= RM. Then formula P

Enquete-Codes
84b. Vitiges' (Aruns') murderer was also killed (ibid.)
85b. Livy's Tarquinian version devoted Aruns' murderer special chapter (half Ch. VI, Bk. II). Procopius' Gothic version dedicated special legend to this single combat ([109]; see also below)
To 85b: Procopius supplied the "pagan" legend about Vitiges' and Belisarius' single combat: Two cowherds fought during the Gothic war, one representing Vitiges, and the other Belisarius, who overpowered the former and was sentenced to death by hanging (allegedly, "in jest"). However, the "joke" ended tragically, and the cowherd Vitiges died (was "hanged") [44]. The tragic outcome was interpreted by the people as an "omen" of Belisarius' victory [44].
86a. After Victor's (= Rector's) death, his body captured, and given to Trojans only through negotiations 87a. Sequence of deaths: Patroclus' (= BRT), Victor's (= VCTR = Rector's) and Achilles' death (= LS) [250]
86b. "Gothic version" described Vitiges' captivity and then his death [109]
87b. Sequence of deaths: Brutus' (= BRT = Proectus), Vitiges' (= VTGS = Aruns) and Belisarius' (= BLSR) death [109], [174]

To 90-92:
"And king Priam (P + RM-A. F.) said to Achilles: 'Swear that you will not make war on us, and then ... I shall give you my daughter Polyxena ... ', and king Priam was first to swear ... And Achilles bowed, offering his promise" ([250], p. 75).
"Achilles ... was ready ... to conclude a peace treaty with the Trojans" (ibid., p. 205, Comm. 44).
"The armistice was still in force ... Achilles sent his secret envoy to queen Hecuba ... He will make the whole Greek army leave Trojan soil, and go back where they came from" ([250], pp. 120-121).
93a. Achilles' "betrayal" played important role in TR-war. In particular, it led to Achilles' death [250)
94a. Achilles "betrayal" led to his and Agamemnon's, Greeks' "main" king's, quarrel ([250], pp. 122, 217, Comm. 119)
95a. Because of Achilles' "betrayal" and his quarrel with "principal" king, he did not leave his ship, as if he had been "on house arrest" (ibid.)
96a. In spite of his initial consent to betray Greeks, Achilles then refused to fulfil his promise to withdraw Greek troops (ibid.)
97a. Nevertheless, Achilles also rejected active participation in war, "ordered his myrmidons not to be engaged in a battle with the Trojans, and not to dare help the Greeks" ([250], p. 122)
98a. Armistice then ended, and war resumed with prior intensity
99a. With Achilles absent, Greek army was heavily defeated; in particular, "... Trojans burned more than five hundred Greek ships" ([250], pp. 122-123)
93b. Belisarius' "betrayal" played important role in GTR-war. In particular, it led to Belisarius' dismissal so he could not take part in it; he died in disgrace ([109); see above)
94b. Belisarius' "betrayal" led to his quarrel with Justinian, Greeks' "principal" king [44)
95b. Because of Belisarius' betrayal and his quarrel with "principal" king, he was arrested and taken prisoner (see above and [124))
96b. In spite of his initial consent to betray Greeks (at least, as stated by Goths; see above), Belisarius then refused to fulfil his promise to withdraw Greek army
97b. Nevertheless, Justinian recalled Belisarius from Italy, allegedly to another theatre of military action,
"Persian" (= PRS) [109). For several years, Belisarius was absent from Italy
98b. Armistice then ended, and war resumed with prior intensity [109)
99b. (Romaic) Greek army was heavily defeated in 540-544 A.D. in Belisarius' absence [44). Goths again conquered much of Italian territory ([44), [109))

101a. Further fate of these treasures: 101b. Further fate of these treasures: They sunk in sea after Greeks had recaptured them. "And then multitude of Greek ships sunk, and all riches amassed by robbery were devoured by the sea" ([250], p. 134), which had occurred already after fall of Troy
9. Troilus = Totila; Paris = Porsena
102a. After Victor's(= Hector's) death, Troilus became first important king and Trojans' army commander ( "king Troilus"). Chronicles stress that king was young ([250], p. 218, Comm. 124) 103a. Name: "Troilus"
104a. Troilus was relative of "principal" Trojan king Priam, i.e., his son ([250], p. 123)
105a. Trojan version especially stressed Troilus' bravery in quite specific terms. Not every Trojan hero demonstrated "outstanding bravery" according to chronicles. Here is one of chapters: "On Troilus' remarkable strength ..." (ibid.)
106a. Commanded by Troilus, Trojans held series of splendid victories. "How many Greeks perished today under the Trojans' swords (commanded by Troilus-A. F.)" (ibid.)
They sunk in lake, thrown there by defeated Goths (= TRQN) at very end ofGTR-war ((44), [109])
102b. After Vitiges' defeat and his captivity, Totila was elected first important king and Goths' (= TRQN) army commander. Chronicles stress that king was young [44]
103b. Name: "Totila", which is close to "Troilus" 104b. Totila was relative of previous Gothic king Ildibald, his nephew (ibid.)
105b. "Gothic version" specifically praised Totila's bravery in quite vivid and individual terms. (Romaic) Greeks were "... startled by the appearance of a new Gothic hero ... A spirit of enthusiasm took possession of the warlike people (the Goths-A. F.) and everything was changed in a moment as by the wand of a magician" ([44], V. 1, pp. 418-419)
106b. Commanded by Totila, Goths (= TRQN) held series of splendid victories. "A year spent in reduction of several towns ... sufficed to make Totila dreaded ... The terror of his name went before him" (ibid., p. 419)

107a. During Troilus' brilliant successes, Achilles did not take part in TRwar (ibid.)
108a. King Paris {= PRS) takes active part in battle along with Troilus (ibid., pp. 122-123). Freed of vowels, his name PRS is extremely close to PRSN, and identical with PRS {= "Persians")
109a. Though Paris (= PRS) took part in TR-war from its very beginning, his role was especially important during Troilus' "reign" when Paris {PRS) always followed Troilus, and Trojan version spoke ofTroilus and Paris {[250], p. 124)
110a. Paris was killed some time after his "enthronement" with Troilus ([250], p. 129)
llla. Above isomorphism "Paris= Paris (in France)" points to "Franks", therefore, taking part in TR-war along with Trojans (= TRKVN) under PRS name
107b. In epoch of Totila's brilliant successes, Belisarius did not take part in GTR-war [109]
108b. King Porsena (= PRSN) took active part in battles together with Totila = Livy's Tarquin. According to "Gothic version" , Persians {= PRS) attacked empire simultaneously with Totila, with whom Belisarius had to fight [44]
109b. Though "Persians" (according to Gothic version) troubled empire long ago, they were especially troublesome during Totila's reign, making war against empire along with this king. For example, Procopius spoke of pair "Totila-Persians" (= PRS). Livy also spoke of pair "Tarquins-Porsena" {see above) attacking empire [174]
110b. Livy reported of serious attempt on Porsena's life {see legend of Gaius Mucius Scaevola; ibid.). According to "Gothic version", PRS' attack on empire failed
lllb. We have already associated Porsena and "Persians" above with Franks(= TRNK), who, according to 6th-c. chronicles, did take part in GTR-war along with Goths (= TRQN)
To llla: "The tale of creating and capturing Troy ..." called Paris Farizh, {i.e., Paris due to the known assimilation P-+F ([250], pp. 70-71). Thus, the chronicle unambiguously points to the origin of king Paris being Paris in France, which is well consistent with the placement of Porsena (= PRS) on the Franks, already known to us; recall also that the capital of France is Paris. Furthermore, Franks = TRKVN are identified with Trojans= TRN in the phonetic analogy, which immediately explains why Paris= PRS was Trojan= TRNK = TRNKV. Thus, the Franks= Frenchmen (or "Gauls") originated from the "Trojans"= TRKVN, which is just what the above medieval point of view stated.

119a. Troilus' battle and his defeat oc- 119b. Tejas' battle and his defeat occurred at Troy's walls (ibid.) curred at Naples' walls (ibid.)
This again places Troy on Naples. Thus, Troy is identified with Naples at the beginning of the GTR-war and at its end. In the middle of the GTR-war, Troy is placed on the pair "Naples-Rome".
120a. After above events, Achilles was killed (ibid.)
121a. Achilles' death is related to his "betrayal" : Because of promise to marry Polyxena, and to stop war, Hecuba offered him to come to Troy for negotiations. He did come, and was cowardly stabbed in back ([250], pp. 75, 128)
120b. After above events, Belisarius died (circumstances surrounding his death are not clear) [44], [124]

122a. Achilles' death took place during negotations when he was wounded in "heel" or in back, and not in battle (ibid.)
122b. Belisarius' death occurred soon after his release, and not in battle [124]
10. The other Trojan legends. We have seen that the legends of king Tejas were partly included in the "biography" of Troilus = Totila in the Trojan cycle. However, it turns out that Tejas himself (figuring under the same name!) was mentioned in the Trojan legends, too.
123a. Known king Toas took part in TR- 123b. Well-known king Tejas took part war ([250],pp.113, 218, Comm.126) in GTR-war (see above). Name "Tejas" is practically identical with "Toas'' 124a. King Toas was on Greeks' side, but repeatedly imprisoned by Trojans, who took him to Troy ([250], pp. 113, 125)
124b. King Tejas was Goth(= TRQN), headed group "parallel" to Trojans. According to Trojan version, he was now Greek, then Trojan ("taken prisoner")
It is important that we have exhausted all the principal legends of the Trojan cycle speaking of the Trojan war. Below, we give parallels between the other, less essential legends.
125a. After Troy's fall, Trojans fled from Trojan kingdom, scattering in all directions [250]
126a. Centaurs took part in TR-war on Trojans' side. Name "centaur" = CNTR, i.e., Tarquin ([250], pp. 214103, 214-215, Comm. 78)
127a. King Remus (founder of Rome?) declared war on Greeks in TRwar on Trojans'(= TRKVN) side ([250], pp.109, 216,229, Comm. 96)
128a. King Remus, owner of "horses", on which Troy's fate mystically depended (ibid., p. 216, Comm. 96). Until Remus "owned horses" , Troy had not been defeated (ibid.)
125b. After fall ofkingdom ofOstrogoths, Goths (= Tarquins = TRQN) fled Italy, scattering in all directions (see above)
126b. Goths (= Tarquins = TRQN) took part in GTR-war against (Romaic) Greeks. CNTR is different from TRQN only in position of consonants, and Q instead of C
127b. City of Rome founded by Remus (and Romulus) made war against Greeks in GTR-war as one of capitals of German Gothic kingdom
128b. Rome (=Naples) owned aqueducts = "horses" on which, as we have seen, fate of Trojan Roman state in GTR-war did, in fact, depend. If the aqueduct had not been captured, Naples would not have been defeated



260
129a. Ulysses (probably, that very Achilles) "stole Remus' horses" (ibid.)
130a. Capturing "Remus' horses" led to Troy's fall (ibid.)
131a. One of Trojan versions stated that "... if Remus' horses had drunk water from the Scamander (river on which Troy stood: Tiber; see above-A. F.), Troy would not have been taken" (ibid.)
132a. Apparently, king Remus was killed in TR-war, falling to ground after being struck by spear ([250], p. 109). Another appearance of Remus in episode with Amazons relates it to very start of TR-war (see below), and does not contradict Remus' death because ofabove confrontation 133a. Amazons took part in war along with Trojans ([250], pp. 74, 129131). Possibly, name "Amazon" is one of forms generating term "Amalasuntha", or vice versa

129b. Belisarius (= Achilles= Ulysses) captured Naples' aqueduct, "stealing horse" (see details above)
130b. Capturing aqueduct (= "horse") led to Naples' (and Rome's) fall (see above) 131b. Probably, authentic event is meant: If aqueduct had remained there, and not been destroyed, as reported by "Gothic version", i.e., if it had "drunk water as always", supplying it to Naples, then, naturally, it would have been impossible to penetrate into city through it
132b. Remus, Rome'sfounder, was killed in battle by Romulus, which occurred at start of Third Empire, i.e., end of Second Empire isomorphic to GTR-war (= TR-war; see above)
133b. Gothic queen Amalasuntha belonged to TRQN group at start ofGTRwar, and was opposing (Romaic) Roman Empire
134a. Amazons' queen was killed in TR- 134b. Goths' queen Amalasuntha (Amawar. Her name: Penthesileia(ibid.). zon Penthesileia?) had been killed She was killed by Greeks (ibid.) before GTR-war, allegedly with

Greeks' consent (see above)
135b. Legend of king Theodahad at start of GTR-war [44]
The names "Teotrat" and "Theodahad" are very close.
136a. King Teotrat was Greeks' enemy. Greeks attacked Teotrat'skingdom ([250], p. 102) 137a. Teotrat was killed in battle (ibid.)
136b. King Theodahad was Greeks' enemy. Greeks attacked Theodahad's kingdom (see above)

147a. Legend of Achilles as "eunuch", servitor in female chamber, even represented on ancient vases and pictures (see below)
143b. Belisarius was extended "by Narses". Possibly, this name is close to Ulikes, Ulikses, Ureksis

148a. Achilles was "eunuch" before TRwar. Posed as woman, dressed in female clothes and did women's job, being forced by certain queen or king. "And Kharan led him (Achilles-A. F.) in female garments, and made him pose as maiden to Lycomedes the king (i.e., made him serve the king as if he had been a girl-A. F.). And there he had all his age with the girls" ((250], p. 142). Other sources also spoke of service to queen

The 1,800-year Third Basic Rigid Shift in Ancient Chronology 263
To 156a: "Mentioning the Sparta of the Trojan war epoch as part of the Romanic (i.e., Roman) kingdom is a clear anachronism of a medieval author" ([250], p. 210, Comm. 28). "Mentioning the Cyclades as 'Roman' is an anachronism: They came under Roman power only in the 2nd c. B.C." ([250], p. 212, Comm. 55). "Thessaly is sometimes erroneously identified by them (authors of the Trojan cycle-A. F.) with Thessaloniki ... a city which was founded much later, and which became ... one of the most important medieval Byzantine centres" ([250], p. 208, Comm. 2). "Typically medieval" are also the descriptions of arms used in the TR-war ([250], pp. 210,214, Comms. 31, 73). Aeneas arrived in Italy after the fall of Troy on board a ship (where his grandson Romulus founded Rome). "Procopius .. . describes one work of antiquity with special minuteness .. . This was the fabulous Boat of Aeneas preserved in the Arsenal on the shores of the Tiber ... The credulous Greek has recorded his admiration of this work, 'surpassing all conception', assuring his readers at the same time that the vessel looks as if just fashioned by a carpenter, and it betrays no signs of decay" ([44], V. I, p. 462). This is not surprising when the TR-war is being placed on the GTR-war in the 6th c. A.D., which is just the time to which "Procopius" description is usually referred.

What percentage of the TR-war heroes turned out to be isomorphic to those of the GTR-war? We confine ourselves to the males, each of whom was mentioned in the cycle on not less than 20 pages of the text [250]. We associated each hero with the number of pages on which his name was mentioned. We obtained (in decreasing order): 51 times for Priam, 39 for Achilles, 35 for Agamemnon, 34 for Menelaus, 33 for Hector, 32 for Paris, 23 for Ajax and 22 for Troilus. Of eight heroes, seven were included in the parallel (with the exception being Ajax). Thus, 87 percent of the principal heroes of the TR-version and TR-war turn out to be also mentioned by the GTR-version already in a rough comparison. We believe that the above data are sufficient to identify the legends and "biographies" of the Trojans and Tarquins-Gothic war, which dates the most ancient events of Greek history to not later than the 6th c. A.D. The so-called "classical" Greece also did not start to develop earlier than the 6th c. A.D., which is well consistent with the data regarding medieval Greece (see above).
12. The Christian dating of the Trojan war. We believe that Christian authors made the same error in dating the Trojan war as that which led to moving back in time the Third Empire and the onset of the Second Empire {see above). Meanwhile, the end of the Second Empire, 234-270 A.D., is isomorphic to that of the Third Empire, 536-552 (or 553) A.D. Thus, the GTR- ("imaginary") war turned out to be in the 3rd c. A.D. Upon analyzing the Tarquins' war, we can complete this isomorphism, viz., the "imaginary" GTR-war of the 3rd c. A.D. is isomorphic to the GTR-war in the 6th c. A.D.

3b. Civil war in 536-552 (or 553) A.O.
4b. GTR-war in 536-552 A.O., officially called "Gothic war" (44]. Thus, ends of Second and Third Empires are not only isomorphic, but also similarly called "Gothic wars"

5.6b. Wife of Tarquin the Proud was Tullia, characterized by Livy as "fury" , malicious woman hungry for power

Enquete-Codes
6b. Gothic war in 6th c. A.D. lasted 12 (according to Livy; see above), 16, or 18 years (according to Procopius) in 536-552 (or 535-553) A.D. 12 and 16 are well consistent with 13 and 16 in left column
We have discovered above that the biblical (God-contending and God-praising) chronicles started with Jeroboam I and Rehoboam, who were placed on Constantine I
and Licinius. Constantine I (= Jeroboam I) started reigning in 306 A.D. The Bible called the "great triumvirate" Saul, David and Solomon immediate predecessors of Jeroboam I, which dates the legends of them to not earlier than the 3rd-6th cc. A.D. We will speak of where the "originals" of these legends should be placed. According to traditional chronology, this great "triumvirate" reigned in 1020-965 (or 1004) B.C. (Saul), 1004-965 B.C. (David) and 965-928 B.C. (Solomon) ([39], p. 192; [268], pp. 16-22). Placing the end of Solomon's reign onto 306 A.D., i.e., the start of Jeroboam's rule, we obtain 214-230 (or 269) A.D. for Saul, 230-269 for David, and 269-306 A.D. for Solomon. (Real originals should be placed in 10-llth cc, A.D. or in 13th c. A.D.; see GCD.) It is important that the "imaginary" GTR-war in the 3rd c. (235-251) A.D. practically coincides with David's "reign" in 230-269 A.D., the consequence being that if a Christian historian were going to date the GTR-war in its "imaginary" version (to the 3rd c. A.D.), then he would have to write that "the Trojan war had occurred under the Judaean king David". It is very important that this is just what was done by the medieval chronicles. Here are the titles of some of them: "The tale of the founding and capturing of Troy, and of its last sack occurring under David, king of Judaea", and also "Thus Troy was sacked under the reign of king David, or in Jerusalem over Israel' ([250], p.147). The coincidence is ideal.
8.2. The Reflection of the Trojan war and the GTR-war in the 1st c. B.C. (Sulla, Pompey and Julius Caesar)
1. New parallels in Roman history (the ''great Triumvirate": Sulla, Pompey, Julius Caesar and the GTR-war in the 6th c. A.D.). It is hard to find ancient historical heroes more popular from the modern standpoint than Julius Caesar, Pompey or Brutus. We all know from childhood numerous works (historical novels, feature films, etc.) devoted to the legendary history of this epoch. More unexpected is the fact that the bulk of this time is another "mould" of later (medieval) events, which was pushed back in time due to the above chronological shifts by c. 333 and 1,053 years, discovered by means of the GCD. We now describe the intermediate isomorphism between the block T on the line E before the Second Roman Empire and the block T on the line E at the end of the Third Roman Empire, i.e., the Gothic war in the 6th c. A.D. Above, we established the isomorphism between the two "Great Triumvirates", viz., Sulla, Pompey and Julius Caesar in 82-45 B.C. at the start of the Second Roman Empire, and Aurelian, Diocletian and



Third basic 1,800-year rigid shift in ancient chronology 267
Constantius I Chlorus in 270-306 A.D. at the start of the Third Roman Empire. We now give a brief description of the "placement" of the isomorphisms:
Pompey Julius Caesar Sulla and Cicero
on on on
Justinian Belisarius Narses (and Belisarius)
which once again stresses the very important role played by the "Gothic= Trojan= Tarquinian" war (= GTR-war) in the establishment of the global chronology of the ancient and medieval world. We emphasise that, considering the parallel, we do not at all assert that one of the terms of the pair is the original, exhibiting the "original" below. It will be (at least, in its basic characteristics) the Italian war in the 13th c. A.D. and the fall of Constantinople in 1204 A.D.
2. Four statistical duplicates: the Gothic war in the 6th c. A.D. = the Roman war
(Julius Caesar) in the 1st c. B.C. = the Trojan war in the 13th c. B.C. and = the Tarquinian war in the 6th c. B.C.

The explicit phonetic parallel between "Belisarius" and "Julius Caesar" is manifest. Earlier, we have already seen that Valerius (or Volusius) = Belisarius, whereas "Achilles" also contains LS. Now, some words about the analogy between Julius Caesar and Belisarius. As a matter of fact, the majority of the Latin inscriptions were made so that U was written as V (see, e.g., [132], p. 32); therefore, foreigners could as well have read "Jvlius Caesar", i.e., "Belisarius". Besides, "caesar" is close to the Slavonic "tsar" (= TSR) and then "Vliuscaesar" could have been read by foreigners as "Veliuscar", which is close to "Belisarius". It is possible that "Belisarius"

It is probable that, in the times of Plutarch, the relation of Sulla (= SLL) to
Belisarius = Valerius = Caesar had not yet been completely lost. At any rate, Plutarch made Sulla "marry" Valeria at the end of Sulla's life ([268*], V. 2, p. 147). The name "Valeria" is almost identical to "Valerius-Belisarius" (cf. Aurelia, Caesar's mother). All phonetic analogies from which we have begun studying the isomorphism only play the role of prompting hints. We now come around to more essential facts. For the reader, new is the second column in discussing the events at the beginning of the Second Empire, whereas the remaining three have been linked by the isomorphisms earlier.

16d.Three figures: Tarquinius the Proud, Tarquinius Collatinus and Valerius (not forming Triumvirate)
To 16b: Pompey and Caesar were accompanied by Crassus, all forming the so-called First Triumvirate. The most important position was occupied by Pompey Magnus (as well as Agamemnon), the leading army commander was Julius Caesar (as well as Achilles), whereas Crassus, being not a professional military specialist but just a rich Roman, joined the two former military men (as well as Menelaus; cf. TR-version). The ranks are the same both in the Roman version referring to the 1st c. B.C. and the TR-version (268]. Note that the second column describing the Roman version of the 1st B.C. is mainly known from Plutarch's account, whereas the third is the Greek TR-war variant; therefore, the parallel between the second and third columns here and the absence of an isomorphism between the first and fourth (Roman-Eastern Roman) columns is not surprising. The Tarquins' version includes all three figures, Pompey's, Crassus' and Caesar's analogues; however, according to Livy, they do not form a Triumvirate. In the following, both "Greek" columns (according to the treatment) will be linked by a stronger parallel than the one linking the second with the remaining ones. We have already discussed the "legend of a woman" in the GTR-war. It turns out that the same legend is also present in the second column. Indeed,

To 17b: When the relations of Julius Caesar with Pompey and Crassus were still outwardly good, an unpleasant incident occurred in Caesar's household. There was a certain man from the ancient nobility, known for his riches, but who was also among the first ranks of well-known libertines in his outrage and impudence. He fell in love with Pompeia, Caesar's wife, and enjoyed her favours reciprocally. Caesar's mother Aurelia made the lovers' meetings difficult and dangerous with her constant surveillance of her daughter-in-law [268]. Each year, the Romans celebrated the women's holiday of the "kind" goddess, where only women were allowed. All men were removed from Caesar's home, and the festivities began. Claudius ( "Pompeia's lover") secretly penetrated the house, hoping to meet with her, but was discovered by Aurelia's servant and banished from the house in shame (ibid.). The next day, the rumour circulated through all of Rome that Claudius had offended the Gods, and was guilty also towards the city and Gods. One of the tribunes publicly charged Claudius with disgrace, and the most influential senators were against him (ibid.). Caesar divorced Pompeia. Claudius was soon killed in a fight on the Appian Way in 52 B.C. (ibid.).
We now supply a brief analysis.

To 24b: Both Pompey and Caesar were overcome by great mourning after Julia's death (cf. Tarquins' version), while their friends were embarrassed, because the ties of relations broke down, which still supported the peace and consent in the state suffering from discord. In spite of the tribunes' opposition, Julia's body was taken to the Campus Martius [268]. After Julia's death, the relations between Pompey and Julius Caesar worsened sharply, and they "rose against each other" ([268*], V. 2, p. 458, XIII).

To 28b-29b: According to Plutarch, Caesar had long decided to overthrow Pompey [268]. War broke out: Caesar marched on Rome, crossed the Rubicon and took Ariminum, after which the gates were, figuratively speaking, opened for the war in all the lands and seas, and all the Roman laws (cf. Livy's version) were erased along with the frontier of the province; it seemed that not only men and women were wandering in dismay across Italy, but the towns themselves had risen from their seats and run. In Rome itself, the authorities could not support the order by either persuasion or force. Opposing passions and violent agitation reigned everywhere (ibid.). A revolt broke out in Rome, and Pompey left the city. Believing that the war would spread across the whole country, Pompey declared publicly that there was an uprise and no power in Rome, and then left it, ordering the senators and everybody who preferred the fatherland and freedom to tyranny to follow him. The



274 Enquete-Codes
consuls fled, without committing even the usual sacrifices; most of the senators also hurriedly left. Losing out of fear the power to reason, they let themselves be taken by this stream of general fleeing on the eve of a great storm. No matter how much pain the migration caused, the Romans regarded the land from which they had been banished as their home, and left Rome out of love for Pompey (ibid.). This event is precisely analogous to the Tarquins' banishment from Rome by Valerius and that of the Goths by Belisarius. In the TR-version, the kings' "banishment" is referred to the end of the war after Troy had fallen. ([268], "Caesar", XXIX, XXXIII-XXXIV).

The ancient authors themselves associated Pompey Magnus with Agamemnon (placing one on the other automatically arose according to our theory above). Plutarch stated that everybody had charged Pompey with cowardice, and mockingly called him Agamemnon and the King of Kings. According to the Trojan version, Agamemnon had, in fact, been called the King of Kings, heading the Greek hero kings. Unwilling to stop the absolute rule, he allegedly was proud of so many subordinate army commanders asking for his orders in his tent (cf. Agamemnon, [268]).

32b.Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus and Marcus Junius Brutus [268] famous hero of civil war in 1st c. B.C., liberator of Rome from tyrant. Plutarch mixed up these two "Brutuses"; they are, probably, reflections of one figure. Indeed,

(3)Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus participated in anti-Caesar conspiracy (ibid.)
(2)Marcius Junius Brutus was at first a companionin-arms of Julius Caesar. It is very probable that he participated in wars together with Julius Caesar
(3)Marcius Junius Brutus participated in antiCaesar conspiracy [268]
33b.Marcius Junius Brutus was well-known for liberating Rome from tyrant by having Julius Caesar killed along with other conspirators (official wording according to Plutarch)
34b.Marcus Junius Brutus was then killed. His father, also Brutus (!), was killed by Pompey (ibid.). "Principal king" Pompey was earlier placed by us on Tarquins
32d.Lucius Junius, son of Marcus, Brutus was famous hero of Tarquins' war, who liberated Rome from tyrant. His name is very close to that of Brutus in left column
33d.(Lucius), son of Marcus, Junius Brutus was well-known for having banished Tarquins from Rome (together with Valerius), and for having killed king's son Aruns, enemy of Rome
34d.(Lucius), son of Marcus, Junius Brutus was killed in battle with Tarquins, by Aruns (see left column ibid.)
The ancient authors themselves (without our prompting) draw analogies between Marcus Junius Brutus from the 1st c. B.C. and Lucius, son of Marcus, Junius Brutus, hero of the Tarquinian war. Moreover, these two "Brutuses" are probably the unique pair of popular Brutuses in the history of Rome. According to Plutarch, Marcus Brutus' forefather, meaning Marcus Junius Brutus, contemporary of Julius Caesar, was Junius Brutus, hero of the Tarquinian war, whose bronze statue with a sword in the hand was erected on the Capitoline Hill among the statues of kings, for Rome



276 Enquete-Codes
owed him most of all for the fall of the Tarquins [268]. Marcus Junius Brutus had long been called to decisive actions against Julius Ceasar's tyranny. The ancient Brutus' statue to the hero of the Tarquinian war, who had overthrown the kings' power, was criss-crossed with inscriptions such as "O, if you were with us today!" or "If Brutus were alive!". The judges' chair, where Brutus performed his duties . as a praetor, once turned out to be showered with tables with the words "Are you sleeping, Brutus?" and "You are not the real Brutus!". The blame for this malice against the dictator (Plutarch meant Julius Caesar, and Livy meant Tarquin the Proud) lay with his flatterers inventing for him still new and hated honours; they reckoned that the people would proclaim Caesar king, but what happened was quite the opposite (ibid.).
All the juxtapositions by Plutarch, who had already taken the two Brutuses to be different persons, but was forced to constantly place one on the other, are stipulated by traditional chronology that forcefully separates the same legend of Brutus into two copies, one of which turned out to have lived in the 1st c. B.C., and the other in the 6th c. B.C., during the war with the Tarquins due to which Junius Brutus appeared, son of Marcus and liberator of Rome from the Tarquins tyranny, and also Junius Brutus Marcus, liberator of Rome from Julius Caesar' tyranny.

To 42b: Julius Caesar's Gallic war was, according to Plutarch, the greatest and most dangerous war ever waged in Gaul [268). Its description is one of the central moments in Julius Caesar's "biography" recorded by Plutarch. The culmination was the siege of the strong fortress Alesia. Most of the surviving barbarians hid in the city of Alesia along with their king. During the siege of the city, which seemed impregnable due to its high walls and numerous defenders, Caesar subjected himself to very serious danger, for the best of all the Gauls' tribes arrived at Alesia, whereas the number of those who had locked themselves inside was no less than 170,000 (ibid.). The battle of Alesia enjoys well-deserved fame, since no other war gives an example of so many brave and artful deeds [268). It is possible that the
term "Alesia" is a distortion of "Achilles", Julius Caesar's = Belisarius' analogue. This well-known siege and the taking of Alesia were included in the military history textbooks as an example of the ancients' military art (e.g., [278), V. 1), ([268], "Caesar", XXV-XXVII).

To 45b: Vercingetorix, the commander for the entire war, came out of the gates. He jumped off his horse, stripped off all the armour and, sitting at Caesar' feet, remained there until he was taken in custody to be preserved for the triumph [268]. Caesar did not succeed in obtaining the triumph until six years later. All these years, Vercingetorix was kept in prison, and was killed immediately after the triumph ([268*], V. 2, p. 544).

To 47b-48b: Pressed between such great forces (Gauls =PRS and RVNT =CRNT), Caesar had to erect two walls, one against the city, and the other against the invading Gauls, for it was clear that, if the enemy had united, Romans would have been immediately defeated (how simply the ancient army commanders built powerful walls around cities!-A. F.). But it is still more surprising that Caesar kept it secret (?) after a battle with numerous armies outside the city's walls and its defeat, not only from the besieged, but also from the Romans who guarded the wall facing the city. This immense force was destroyed and scattered instantaneously, and most of the barbarians perished. Finally, Alesia also surrendered (268]. Caesar hardly built "double walls"; most probably, this reflects the same trick of the use of an aqueduct constructed even before the war (and not just several days before). It should be noted that aqueducts were built as enormous chutes running between two vertical

To 59b: Plutarch: Caesar's hunger for regal power aroused sheer hatred for him and led to attempts on his life. Caesar's principal blame was just in that for the people ... Those who were talking Caesar into accepting the power circulated the rumour among the people ... [268]. Allegedly, against his own will, Caesar turned out to be very close to "regal power" (ibid.). Like Belisarius and Valerius= Volusius, Caesar strove to demonstrate the falseness of all these charges, and publicly rejected the title of king, which was given to him by his partisans (ibid.). However, this did not calm the Romans, and the displeasure with him grew ([268*], V. 2, pp. 485-486).

To 65d: Livy asserted that Valerius' being charged with striving for regal power had been based on his construction of a house on a hill, turning it into a fortress. Allegedly for the purpose of stopping the rumour, Valerius ordered the demolition of his house and its transfer to the valley (174].

70d. "Lartius" IS close to "Narses"
To 69b: During Caesar's Gallic war (according to Plutarch) Cicero commanded a legion [268]. The historians regarded this Cicero as Marcus Tullius Cicero's "brother", but Plutarch himself said nothing about him, only mentioning a "Cicero". The orator Cicero, i.e., the famous Cicero, who was not a professional military man (like Narses, who was a eunuch in the court), but was Julius Caesar's favourite and repeatedly took part in military action (e.g., during his reign in Cilicia, an army of 1,200 men and 2,600 cavalrymen was under his command) (ibid.). According to Plutarch, Cicero made war, and the warriors rewarded him with the title of emperor (ibid.). Cicero was a consul and did not take part in the conspiracy against Caesar (ibid.). After Julius Caesar's death, a movement arose in Rome which lifted Cicero (succeeding Julius Caesar) to the crest of the political wave. Cicero's name was often heard and acquired a special influence at that time, being the symbol of the republic ([258], p. 174.). Thus, Cicero "extended" Julius Caesar's cause, Narses extended Belisarius', and Ulysses extended Achilles' cause (see above) ([268], "Caesar", XXIV; "Cicero", XXXVI).
71a.Narses and Belis- 71b.Cicero and arius allegedly were friends (109]. Narses did not take part in Belisarius' arrest and persecution
Julius Caesar were on friendly terms [268]. Cicero did not take part in antiCaesar conspiracy

284 Enquete-Codes
The terms "orbator" and "orator" are extremely close. Therefore, some authors
(e.g., Procopius) described Narses' (= NRSS) "sterility", whereas others (e.g.,
Plutarch) speak of Cicero's (= CCR) "oratorial qualities". It is pertinent to refer to the Latin here, since we analyze Roman history. This is the same mechanism which turned "aqueduct" into "horse". A foreign chronicler would understand a little-known term differently, and, giving it a new meaning due to phonetic proximity, would colour the new word with his own special "tints".

To 73b: That Cicero (= CCR) is Caesar's (= CSR) "continuation" can also be seen from the fact of Plutarch's special mention of these two historical figures as of being extremely good at oratory. Both Cicero and Caesar learned this art at the same school of Apollonius' [268]. Plutarch counts no outstanding orators among other participants in the war of the 1st c. B.C ([268], "Caesar", III).

To 74b: Cicero spent one and a half years in exile ([258*], p. 156). His house in Rome was destroyed, the estate sacked, and a considerable part of his possessions confiscated. Under the threat of death, it was forbidden to supply shelter to the exiled if he found himself at a distance of less than 500 miles from Rome ([258*], p. 156).

To 75b: After Cicero's banishment, the situation in Rome changed, and the decision to return him to Rome was adopted by the assembly. In August A.D. 57, Cicero landed in Brundisium, and his return to Rome turned into a triumph. In Rome, he made thanksgiving speeches before the senate and the people ([258*], p. 156, Comm.).

8. Anthony and Antonina
77a.Antonina: Belisarius' wife and one of basic figures in Gothic war [109]
77b.Anthony: closest associate ofJulius Caesar and one of basic figures in war of 1st c. B.C.
The names "Anthony" and "Antonina" are practically identical.
78a. Antonina constantly accompanied Belisarius during Gothic war. She was powerful woman, and allegedly strongly influenced her "husband" Belisarius [109]
78b. Anthony constantly accompanied Julius Caesar during his war with Pompey, Gothic war's analogue (see above) [268]
To 78: The difference between them is in "Antonina" being a woman (according to the chronicles of the 6th c. A.D.), and "Anthony" a man (according to Plutarch). At the same time, Plutarch (without our prompting) compared the Trojan war with that in the 1st c. B.C., and associated the "man" Anthony with the "woman" Helen, indicating that Cicero wrote in his Philippicae that the Trojan war had been waged by Helen, and the intestine war by Anthony [268].
79a. Antonina: prostitute in Eastern Roman Empire (second-most known after Theodora, Justinian's wife) [44], [109]
79b. Anthony: well-known Roman profligate, of whom allegedly legends were made (see below)
To 79b: Young Anthony was extremely handsome. Curiosity made Anthony addicted to drink, promiscuity and monstrous prodigality. Plutarch devoted many pages to the description of Anthony's "entertainment". The whole way of Anthony's life seemed outrageous to "good citizens": They loathed his disgusting evils, horrible spending and interminable debauchery with prostitutes (ibid.). All of Anthony's characteristics are unique, and no other figure taking part in the war of the 1st c. B.C. was characterized by Plutarch likewise (ibid.). Therefore, superimposing



286 Enquete-Codes
the "promiscuous Anthony" on the "promiscuous Antonina" is to make the two unique descriptions by Plutarch and Procopius coincident. The 6th-c. chronicles called the "prostitute" Antonina a "haetera". We should not consider the term "haetera" to be a unique equivalent of "prostitute", but to possess another meaning: Ancient authors called the selected cavalry this way (ibid.). Therefore, "haetera" is also applicable to a man, as "selected horseman" ([268], "Anthony", II, IX).
80a. Haetera Antonina [109] 80b. "Haetera" Anthony who, in fact, commanded selected cavalry in Julius Caesar's army (268] (see below)
To 80b: Anthony was a "haetera", who personally commanded the cavalry corps, and led it in cavalry battles (e.g., in the battle with Octavianus Caesar) [268]. Besides, he commanded Julius Caesar's (i.e., "Belisarius' ") cavalry; in other words, he was "haetera Anthony" commanded by Julius Caesar. It is not surprising that the formula for Procopius could turn into "haetera" Antonina commanded by Belisarius. Plutarch also indicated that the cavalry's commander was the second-most important after the dictator (ibid.), speaking of Anthony and Julius Caesar, respectively.
81a. Haetera Antonina: Belisarius' wife 81b. "Haetera" Anthony was married to [109] Julia from House of Caesar [268]
The interchange of the two similar terms "Antonina, 'Julius Caesar's' wife" and Anthony's wife, "Julia from the House of Caesar" is manifest.
82a. Well-known haetera Theodora was "principal king" Justinian's wife (cf. names "Theodora" and "Flora")
83a. According to Procopius, Theodora was Eastern Roman Empire's ruler. Effigies of her are preserved in New Rome's temples [44]
82b. Well-known haetera Flora was lover of "principal king" Pompey (Justinian's analogue) for long time [268] 83b. According to Plutarch, haetera Flora was so famous that temples (?) were decorated with effigies of her, which were also offered Gods (ibid.)
To 83b: Most probably, effigies of Flora were placed in the temples because she was the empress Theodora's "double", whose portraits are, in fact, in holy temples [44] (see above).
84a. 84b. Legend of calling Romans to leave Rome and to look for freedom on hill (see below)
84d. Legend of calling Romans . to leave Rome and to look for freedom on hill [174]
Without our prompting, Plutarch reported in his description of the war of the



Third basic 1,800-year rigid shift in ancient chronology 287
1st c. B.C. that the call for "freedom on a hill", which had once been heard (uniquely in the whole of Roman history until the 1st c. B.C.!) during the Tarquinian war. Thus, Plutarch associated the event of the 1st c. with that of the 6th c. B.C. In our opinion, this can only mean that Plutarch, without suspecting it himself, actually described the first years of the Roman republic, traditionally related to the 6th c. B.C., and superimposed over the events of the 1st c. B.C. (see the above shifts). To 84b: Catullus supplied a multitude of arguments against the law, but, since he could not convince anyone in the assembly, he asked the Senate, and repeatedly cried from the orator's tribune that it should look for a hill or rock after the forefathers' example(!), where they would save freedom [268]. As one of the commentaries goes, Plutarch "... hinted at the events of the first years of the Roman republic when the plebeians, infuriated by the unsuccessfull struggle with the patricians, left Rome for the Sacred Mount" (see the Russian edition of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, V. 2, p. 536, Comm. 41).
It was not accidental that Catullus had made speeches in the (plebeian) assembly (see above).
85a. 85b. Legend of Rape of Sabines 85d. Legend of Rape ofSabines
Without our hinting at that, Plutarch supplied in his description of the war of the 1st c. B.C. the legend of the Rape of the Sabines, speaking of its "repetition" in Caesar's epoch. Recall that Livy placed this legend before the foundation of Rome c. 300 A.D., i.e., at the start of the Third Empire, isomorphic to the Second Empire's beginning. But since part of Livy's History of Rome, placed before the start of Regal Rome(= Third Empire), is isomorphic to the GTR-war (see above), Plutarch draws a parallel between the start of the Second Empire, i.e., the war of the 1st c. B.C. and the Tarquinian war in the 6th c. B.C.
To 85b: According to Plutarch, the praetor Antissaeus offered Pompey to marry Antissaeus' daughter. Pompey accepted the offer and concluded a secret agreement with Antissaeus. Recall that the "rape of the Sabines" was also a secret enterprise [174]. However, the deal became known. When Antissaeus announced the verdict, the people cried thalassio, heard according to the ancient custom at weddings. Plutarch relates the legend of the Rape of the Sabines without, however, reporting to which time this legend should be assigned. Though he mentioned the words "ancient custom", nothing else tells us that it was related to events that occurred several centuries before the 1st c. B.C. With this, I end the brief outline of the isomorphism linking the war of the 1st c. B.C. to the GTR-war of the 6th c. A.D.
It can be seen from the above analysis that the legend of the Rape of the Sabines is placed at the time of the GTR-war, the important "legend" of a woman being present, describing events related to a woman, and which were the cause of the war. Recall that the Rape of the Sabines, too, caused a war between the Romans and Sabines (ibid.). Hence, the Rape of the Sabines is a variant of the "legend of a woman" and part of the legends of the GTR-war, which we discovered above. We will also indicate similar information in our isormorphism diagrams.

8.3. The GTR-war of the 6th c. A.D. and the Nika riot of the 6th c. A.D.
As we see, the GTR-war is an execeptionally important event reflected in many chronicles of different peoples. The above chronicles investigated by us were related, mostly, to events occurring in Italy and around the Italian Rome. However, it is hard to imagine that the same war was in no way considered by Byzantine chronicles describing the reign of Justinian, one of the GTR-war's principal heroes and "principal king" (who did not take part in the battles himself).
It turns out that the GTR-war, in fact, was considered by "purely" Byzantine history as the well-known Nika riot, which took place in 532 A.D., i.e., almost when the GTR-war started in 534-535 A.D. Let me supply the data demonstrating that the legend of the Nika riot is, in most part, isomorphic to the GTR-war in the 6th c. A.D.
The principal documents decribing Justinian's reign in New Rome are the books of Procopius of Caesarea. In one of the "Procopius' " texts ("Procopius's History of His Own Time"), Justinian is represented as a great ruler, and the treatment is in favourable terms, whereas in others (e.g., the Historia arcana or "Secret History of Procopius") the same J ustinian is described in a totally opposite manner. Traditional history even has a legend ofa "two-faced" Procopius, who wrote panegyrics to Justinian in the daytime, and filled the pages of the Historia arcana with the description of Justinian's atrocities at night. However, we are not interested here in the problem of these texts' authorship, which was ascribed to "Procopius", since it is immaterial for our analysis. Here is the description of the Nika riot.
The uprise shook the empire in 532 A.D. For a reason which is not very clear, a large-scale uprise broke out in New Rome without any leaders who would, e.g., fight for regal power, which was very strange. The mutiny lasted for a short time (no more than several weeks), and was characterized by its extreme extent; in military confrontations, great military forces took part; it was not just a mutiny, but a large-scale civil war. New Rome was burning. The mutiny was started by two "parties", Venets and Prasins united against Justinian, but not following any "positive" programme. Justinian's army commander Belisarius (!) was ordered to suppress the mutiny, and led into the battle a powerful Gothic under Mund's command garrison together with Roman (Romaic) troops. In fear, Justinian hid in the palace, and did not take part personally in fighting the "mutineers" (in contrast to Belisarius), not storming the palace for some reason, though, according to Procopius, there were no special fortifications around. Belisarius soon managed to lure the rioting crowd into the hippodrome (circus) by a non-trivial trick, and there massacred a lot of them.

14b. Well-known commander Mund took part in suppressing Veniti (Trojans?) and Prasins (= PRSN) along with Belisarius (ibid.)
To 14b: The crowds taking part in the uprise were allegedly lured into an enormous hippodrome (circus). There is a legend asserting that the declaration of J ustinian's nephew Ignatius as new emperor was arranged by Justinian himself, and this trick let him assemble the crowd in the circus, where the mutineers were massacred, and "more than 30,000 men died" ([105], p. 61.).
15a. Trick involved aqueduct, "Trojan 15b. Trick involved hippodrome, arena horse", i.e., drawing off of water for races. Thus, that very "course (see above) for horses" arises in this version again [105]
Thus, some ancient chroniclers spoke of an aqueduct, whereas others of a "grey likeness of a horse", and still others of an arena for races (hippodrome), all being different versions and interpretations of the same authentic event.
According to the Bible and our isomorphisms, Justinian and his suppression of the Nika riot are superimposed on the God-praising king Manasseh and the massacre during his reign. Hence, biblical Manasseh's "biography" described the same GTRwar in the 6th c. A.D. in its Byzantine God-praising version, viz., suppression of the "mutiny". The resume:

9. Egyptian Chronology
9.1. Difficulties in creating Egyptian chronology
The "convolution" of Roman history, i.e., the identification of the Second Empire with the Third-Empire jet, etc., automatically generates that of Egyptian chronology, and does not contradict any available and dated Egyptian documents. Egyptology, thanks to which for the first time the dark was dispelled that previously covered Egyptian antiquity, was born only 80 years ago. This was written by P. Chantepie de la Saussaye in the late 19th c. [234]. In particular, the chronology of Egypt is one of the youngest historical sciences; it was formed on the basis of Greco-Roman chronology and, therefore, depends on it. The first Egyptologists and creators of chronology did not possess any objective criteria for testing their hypotheses, which led to large divergences between different chronologies of not less 3,000 years (see Part 1). The rule durations are indicated in certain dynastic transcripts (preserved) for certain Pharaohs, but not at all for everyone of them; however, the figures differ sharply when we go from one list to another. E.g., the duration of Ammen-Emes reign is 26 years according to the second version of Eusebius, and 5 years according to Aphricanus, the difference being more than 5 times! A reign of 40 years was indicated by Eusebius for Amenophis, 20 years by Aphricanus and 8 years by Ophis. Eratosthenes allotted a whole century to A-Pappus, etc. The situation is typical for



292 Enquete-Codes
the so-called "Pharaoh lists" ([13], V. 6). However, these "data" can still be a basis for reflection; there is no ground to be surprised at the 18-19th-c. historians attempting to use these figures for chronological purposes, though obtaining differences of 2,000 or 3,000 years. But there are dynasties about whose duration nothing is known at all (e.g., the whole of the 6th dynasty due to H. Brugsch). There is no "biographical" information about most of them; it is, therefore, strange to see the famous Egyptologist H. Brugsch allot (with somewhat gloomy joy), each Pharaoh of this dynasty a 33.3-year reign, assuming three Pharaohs a century (and why not, say, ten or 15?). The difficulties of creating Egyptian chronology are also related to the fact that most preserved monuments with inscriptions are devoted to religious purposes. Of the surviring papyri, probably, nine-tenths are of religious contents. All this material is rather one-sided, and its origin is due to existing funeral rites. However, the inscriptions mostly resemble brief formulas containing the names of the gods of Death. The three large pyramids of all Pharaohs' tombs have no inscriptions ([234*], pp. 99-100). Egyptian dynastic history is not at all continuous and yawns with gaps that are sometimes even a dynasty long ([13], V. 6). At the same time, it has been long noticed in traditional history that ancient Egyptian history is characterized by a strange periodicity. For example, "if we turn to later periods, it is surprising to see that the Saite culture exactly (!-A. F.) reproduces that of the pyramids' epoch. The texts which were in use almost 3,000 years ago were taken up again. Again tombs were decorated after the ancient custom" ([234*], p. 107). This peridiocity of Egyptian history had been noticed long ago, and was officially called "restoration" . For example, after the 19th dynasty, "... a restoration set in ... Egypt again returned to pyramid construction ... That epoch was looked upon as a time of imitation. Ancient religious texts were brought to life, though they were only partly understood. Funeral rites of the 4th-dynasty ·· kings were adopted, their pyramids restored, ancient titles remembered, art returned to the solid realistic school of the Old Kingdom ..." (ibid., p. 173). Certainly, these "restorations" were given an explanation. For example, "The Saite restoration is one of the most remarkable moments in the history of ; Egyptian culture, and the best illustration of the spirit of the Egyptian people" ' (ibid.).
Here is what B. A. Turaev says: "Official texts underwent attempts of editing the archaic language hardly understood by everyone ... The forgotten ranks and posts were revived; the inscriptions of the time could be taken to belong to the Old Kingdom (the same as if you, the reader, started to correspond with your friends in the language of the 1st c. B.C.-A. F)"
([238], v. 2., pp. 102-103). Egypt was probably a great religious centre for the Roman Empire too, with the cult of the dead concentrated there. The dead body does not decay in sand, which accounts for the predominance of the funeral theme in Egyptian monuments and written sources. The Bible also mentions an enigmatic city of David. N. A. Morozov [13] gathered all references to it in the Bible. It turned out that the city was always



Egyptian Chronology 293
mentioned by the Bible as the burial place for God-praising kings (ibid.). It is, therefore, possible that the city of David is not actually a city, but an enormous necropolis, a kings' graveyard. Due to the dynastic parallels, there should be buried rnany Byzantine and Roman emperors. Such a necropolis does exist, and is unique. This is the well-known field of the pyramids and tombs of Giza in Egypt. The rite ofembalming the dead body probably arose just for the purpose of preserving it from decay, when it was carried into Egypt (e.g., from Europe) across the Mediterranean sea. There are ancient coins on which the Roman emperor Octavian Augustus is depicted as a Pharaoh (magazine Vokrug Sveta, 4, 1983). Recall that a dead body immediately buried in the sands of Egypt is not subject to decay; therefore, there is no necessity to embalm the local dead. It is now appropriate to draw our attention to the Greek legends of Charon, the carrier of the souls of the dead across a very wide river (probably, the Mediterranean Sea), or the dead themselves from Greece to the world below. The construction of enormous Egyptian pyramids was probably reflected in the Bible as the erection of the Tower of Babel. For all their richness, archaeological data for Egypt are extremely chaotic, and unrelated to a continuous independent chain. According to the archaeologist M. Z. Goneim, we know almost nothing of a single pharaoh of the third dynasty, except Zoser. Unfortunately, even this name is a later version that was not in use for a long time after his death, and encountered for the first time only in the 12th dynasty [239].
It is known that the Hittites were "discovered" only in 1880 when Professor Archibald Sayse reported the existence of an ancient people called the Hittites,
basing himselfon the biblical analysis ([241 *], p. 21). Together with William Wright, A. Sayse made it clear that the Hittites had lived north of the "Promised Land", and placed them in Asia Minor north of Palestine. However, if we admit that the "Promised Land" is in Europe, e.g., Lombardy in Italy, then the Hittites had to live north of Lombardy, in the place of the Goths. Superimposing the Hittites in this fashion on the Goths is also confirmed by the dynastic parallels.

Part 2
THE DATING
OF THE EGYPTIAN ZODIACS
A. T. Fomenko, T. N. Fomenko, G. V. Nosovskiy
A foreword to Part 2
The dating of the Egyptian zodiacs is a problem that was studied by many scientists of the XIX-XX
century. A large contribution into the solution of this problem was made by N. A. Morozov ([544],
Volume 4). However, his analysis of the Egyptian zodiacs is far from final, and the datings he came
up with aren’t quite satisfactory from the astronomical point of view. This was pointed out in the
work of N. S. Kellin and D. V. Denisenko ([376]), who have managed to get a better solution for the
Round Zodiac of Dendera than N. A. Morozov. However, they admit it themselves that their
solutions are also far from ideal ([376]).
The first one to suggest a strict approach to the selection of astronomical solutions for the
Egyptian zodiacs was T. N. Fomenko in [912:3]. This work demonstrated in particular that the
Egyptian zodiacs allow for ideally strict solutions in case of certain interpretations of their
astronomical content, and perfectly allowable ones at that. However, these interpretations as
suggested by [912:3] weren’t the only possible ones. Apart from that, many of the graphical
details found in the Egyptian zodiacs hadn’t yet been deciphered at the time. This goes to say that
at this stage of research the problems of ambiguity and incompleteness of the Egyptian zodiacs’
astronomical interpretation remained unsolved. Another poignant issue was presented by the fact
that the astronomical datings of the Egyptian zodiacs are very unstable in face of variations in
source data – in other words, minute and acceptable changes in the interpretation of a zodiac
could lead to a significantly different astronomical dating thereof.
All of the above means that the astronomical datings of the Egyptian zodiacs obtained by 2001
could not be regarded as final.
This is why A. T. Fomenko and G. V. Nosovskiy launched a new research in 2000-2001 which
included the development of special astronomical software that would make is feasible to run
over all possible variants of the zodiacs’ astronomical interpretation ([METH3]:4). Practically all
of the graphical details found in the Egyptian zodiacs were studied in the process – even the ones
that were considered completely unrelated to astronomy previously. It turned out that each of
those figures has explicit astronomical meaning. This resulted in the important and unexpected



discovery of the fact, that unlike many of the ancient zodiacs, the Egyptian ones contain a great
many additional astronomical data apart from the main horoscope. It is important that these data
weren’t included into the Egyptian horoscopes randomly – they follow a single rigid structure in
every case.
What we have therefore discovered is the general structure of the Egyptian zodiac as a
description of a calendar year spanning the primary date represented by a special cipher of sorts.
As a result, the total amount of useful astronomical information contained in a single Egyptian
zodiac usually suffices in order to decipher the date it stands for; apart from that, it contains an
exhaustive astronomical explanation of its cipher. In other words, our new approach isn’t based
upon the decipherment of the Egyptian zodiac, but rather allows to accomplish said goal via
astronomical calculations, likewise the date of the zodiac. The datings of the Egyptian zodiacs that
we come up with as a result are of a stable nature, and only allow for a single solution in case of
the majority of zodiacs.
From the preface to
The New Chronology of Egypt. The Astronomical Datings of Ancient Egyptian Monuments.
Research of 2000-2002
by A. T. Fomenko and G. V. Nosovskiy (Moscow, Veche, 2002)
This book is dedicated to the interpretations of datings contained in the ancient Egyptian zodiacs.
We set several precise chronological landmarks of Egyptian history here, which was made feasible
by our recently-developed method of the complete deciphering of the Egyptian zodiacs.
In our research of the Egyptian zodiacs we have used many important ideas of our predecessors
N. A. Morozov ([544], Volume 6), N. S. Kellin and D. V. Denisenko ([376]) as well as T. N. Fomenko
([912:3]). In general, our research can be considered to continue and develop theirs. Many of the
doubtless and fundamental facts estimated by these authors in re the astronomical symbols used
in Egyptian zodiacs were adhered to and received independent confirmation. Apart from that, we
have discovered that there is another layer of astronomical symbols present in the Egyptian
zodiacs whose meaning remained beyond our comprehension earlier. This discovery, which came
as considerable surprise even to ourselves, brought us to an altogether new level insofar as the
opportunities of dating the Egyptian zodiacs are concerned. Owing to these unique opportunities
and extensive astronomical computations we could estimate about ten datings as the only ones
possible; all of them were presented in the ancient Egyptian zodiacs with the use of an old “astral
calendar”. All of the dates fall over the same post-XI centurty epoch.



The previously known interpretations of the Egyptian zodiacs (first and foremost the ones
belonging to N. A. Morozov, N. S. Kellin – D. V. Denisenko and T. N. Fomenko were of a partial
nature. These authors managed to obtain astronomical identifications of many zodiacal symbols,
but not all of them, which is quite understandable since one had to sort out a great many
interpretation options, and this is hardly possible to do manually. The interpretation we got in
2001 is the first one which is complete and accounts for all the graphical details of every zodiac; it
also turns out that an astronomical solution is available in every case, which is an extremely
important fact. The existence of such complete interpretation which can always be dated is very
far from obvious a priori. Apart from that, the astronomical solutions that we came up with for
the overwhelming majority of the zodiacs turn out to be the only ones. Our analysis is final in this
respect.
It turns out that the complete interpretation of the primary horoscopes found in Egyptian zodiacs
includes the partial interpretations offered by N. A.Morozov and T. N. Fomenko; however, there
is a certain difference between them details-wise which brings clarity into multiple choice
situations such as the interpretation of the symbols used for the sun and the moon that are rather
easily confused with one another. Our predecessors would argue in favour of their choice after
studying the content of the Egyptian symbols since they had no opportunity of sorting through all
possible interpretation options yet, unlike the authors of the present book. Their interpretations
weren’t final in some cases, which would therefore make the datings they discovered less strict;
therefore, the final datings that we came up with differ from the previous datings offered by
Morozov, Kellin-Denisenko and T. N. Fomenko. However, all of the precise datings remained
mediaeval, which is a rather important fact. It turns out that there isn’t a single astronomical
solution for the Egyptian zodiacs that would date to an epoch preceding the XII century A.D.
We also feel obliged to point out that the final datings that we managed to calculate for the
Dendera zodiacs have already been mentioned in the work of T. N. Fomenko. Namely, she
already considered the dating of the 22-27 April 1168 for the Long Zodiac of Dendera in the
preliminary stage of her analysis, which coincides with the dating discovered by ourselves. This
dating was rejected by T. N. Fomenko due to different identifications of the sun in the
interpretation chosen by N. A. Morozov and the one that turned out final according to our
method ([912:3], page 721). The same work by T. N. Fomenko ([912:3] specified the date of the
30-31 March 1185 as a possible solution for the Round Zodiac in one of the early analysis stages,
which only differs from the final solution dating that we came up with by a mere 10 days. This
dating was also rejected by T. N. Fomenko due to minute discrepancies between her
interpretation and the final interpretation of the Round Zodiac offered by our method. As is the
case with the Long Zodiac of Dendera, these discrepancies concerned the symbols used for the
sun and the moon which are easy to confuse for one another.



Let us reiterate that after we had finished our computer calculations it turned out that the
previous partial interpretations were confirmed for the most part. They comprise the fundament
of the final interpretation, which confirms the general correctness of the previous research. It has
to be said that all of the authors who studied the Egyptian zodiacs that we refer to above always
emphasised that their datings were based on the interpretation options that struck them as the
most likely and not an exhaustive study of all possible variants. Let us now list our datings of the
ancient Egyptian zodiacs based on our final interpretation.
1) The Round Zodiac of Dendera: morning of the 20th March 1185 A.D.
2) The Long Zodiac of Dendera: 22-26 April 1168 A.D.
3) The Zodiac from the Greater Temple of Esna: 31 March – 3 April 1394 A.D.
4) The Zodiac from the Lesser Temple of Esna: 6-8 May 1404 A.D.
The Athribis zodiacs of Flinders Petrie:
5) The Upper Zodiac of Athribis: 15-16 May 1230 A.D.
6) The Lower Zodiac of Athribis: 9-10 February 1268 A.D.
7) The Theban Zodiac of Heinrich Brugsch which, as it turned out, contains a total of three zodiacs,
each one of which gives an independent dating.
7a) The horoscope of demotic additions – 18 November 1861 A.D. (old style).
7b) The horoscope “without rods” – 6-7 October 1841 A.D. (old style).
7c) The “boat horoscope” – 15 February 1853 A.D. (old style).
Thus, the “ancient” Egyptian wooden coffin whose lid was adorned with this spectacular zodiac
was manufactured in the middle of the XIX century.
8) The coloured zodiac of Thebes found in the Egyptian “Valley of the Kings” and represented in
the Napoleonic Egyptian album ([1100]) – 5-8 September 1182 A.D.
The datings we come up with allow us to make the perfectly valid claim that the “ancient” history
of Egypt and its Pharaohs doesn’t date back to several millennia before the new era, but rather to
the XI-XV century A.D. – a “mere” 400-1000 years ago, in other words. As for the grandiose
temples of the ancient Egypt, the Zodiac dates in these temples indicate the epoch of late XII
early XV century A.D.



The dates on the wooden Egyptian coffins (or sarcophagi) are of the utmost interest indeed.
Thesewooden coffins, painted in different colours and covered in hieroglyphs, can be seen in
many art albums on Ancient Egypt. They are considered to be “extremely ancient”. However, it
turns out that their real age can be estimated precisely in certain cases due to the fact that the
lids of these sarcophagi were often adorned with zodiacs containing ciphered dates. Deciphered,
one of them (the zodiac of Brugsch) yielded the middle of the XIX century as a result. In other
words, the “ancient” Egyptians (or, possibly, the Mamelukes) were making such coffins and used
them for burials as recently as 150 years ago. Nowadays they are up on exhibition in many
museums as the alleged relics of “ancient” history.
For some strange reason, we are given no explanation of the fact that the smoothly-planed and
accurately sawed planks these Egyptian coffins are supposed to have been manufactured in
absence of iron tools, likewise the boats of the Pharaohs. The implication is that the “ancient”
Egyptians had planes. However, we are being told that the “ancient” Egyptians only had copper at
their disposal, which isn’t the material one can use for making a plane. What are we left with,
then? Another “mystery of the Ancient Egypt”? Such mysteries are abundant in Egyptian history.
Now we have a means of eliminating them having the knowledge that the “ancient” Egypt, as well
as other “ancient” civilizations are only several centuries old in reality, which is why we often put
the word “ancient” in quotation marks.
As we have demonstrated in our previous books on the subject, the consensual version of ancient
Egyptian chronology is most likely to be erroneous, which brings us to the question of when this
false version first came to existence, as well as the entire erroneous version of Egyptian history
that it is based upon.
It turns out that its roots don’t reach further back than the end of the XVIII century which is when
the Europeans got their first opportunity of travelling to Egypt after several centuries of isolation.
The Napoleonic army disembarked on the Egyptian shore in 1799; this was followed by the defeat
of the Mamelukes in the famous Battle of the Pyramids. This is when the Europeans made their
first acquaintance of the Egyptian antiquities, and the European scientists drew up a more or less
detailed picture of ancient Egyptian history.
Shortly afterwards the “Napoleonic” album with drawings of the Egyptian monuments was
published in France ([1100]). It included detailed drawings of several Egyptian zodiacs, among
other things. This album was the first illustration of what relics were found in Egypt, since the
Europeans only had a vague idea of the land itself as well as its history prior to that. In order to
provide the reader with a demonstrative example of just how meagre the European knowledge of
Egyptian history had been as recently as the XVII century we provide the entire section on
Egyptian history taken from a voluminous and fundamental chronograph dating to the end of the



XVII century in [METH3]:4, Chapter 9. This section in its entirety takes up a mere two pages and
contains nothing remotely resembling the modern version of Egyptian history which came to
existence somewhat later (see ibid).
In school we are told the impressive tale of how Champollion who accompanied the Napoleonic
troops to Egypt managed to decipher the mysterious hieroglyphs which had remained beyond
everyone’s comprehension for several centuries. It turns out that “the last stage the Egyptian
language reached in its development had been the Coptic language of the Christian population of
Egypt ... it was supplanted by the Arabic around the XVII century” ([85], Volume 15, page 464). In
other words, the “ancient” Egyptian language in the final stage of its development had been the
spoken language of the Egyptian Christians up until the XVII century A.D., no less! It becomes
clear why Champollion would have to study the Coptic language in order to decipher the
hieroglyphs ([85], Volume 47, page 510).
It is presumed that the labours of Champollion and his contemporaries, the founders of
Egyptology, enabled the Europeans to glance into the very depths of the Egyptian history of the
Pharaohs, which they were a priori ready to consider “exceptionally ancient”.
Even though the deepest antiquity of the Egypt ruled by the Pharaohs was considered obvious,
exact datings had remained unknown, and there was much diversity in opinions on how certain
events of Egyptian history were to be dated. For instance, there were supporters of the “long”
and the “short” version of Egyptian chronology amongst the Egyptologists; the discrepancy
between the two versions amounted to several thousand years ([METH1]). The datings suggested
by the specialist for the dating of Egyptian monuments could differ by several millennia or even
several dozen millennia. Thus, for instance, the “Egyptologist” dating of the famous Dendera
zodiacs which we shall be considering in the present book, had altered by a whole 15.000 years
([544], Volume 6, page 651).
Egyptologists were making claims about the “indubitable antiquity” of Egyptian history from the
very beginning, and they are still very much at it. However, there is no real evidence to support
this allegedly “self-implied” antiquity. The “reasons” they suggest as validation of this theory don’t
hold up to serious criticisms and are based on absolute certainty that the history of the Pharaohs
pertains to an antediluvian age and had ended before the beginning of the new era (see
[METH1]).
We shall refrain from reiterating our criticisms of the consensual Egyptian chronology and the
radiocarbon datings of the Egyptian specimens in particular, since a detailed rendition of those
can be found in Chron1 and Chron2 by A. T. Fomenko. Let us briefly formulate the hypothesis that
is related in detail in Chron5.



We are of the opinion that the ancient Egypt in the times of the Pharaohs had been the royal
burial ground of the Great Empire in the Middle Ages. This Empire had spanned all of Eurasia and
a large part of Africa in the epoch of the XIV-XVI century A.D. Egypt had been a small part of this
Empire, although it may have been the birthplace of its royal dynasty. The necropolis of the royal
family was located in Egypt, and the population of this country was employed as workers and
keepers of this cemetery. The kings, or the Pharaohs, did not live in Egypt and were brought here
post-mortem. We consider this to be the explanation of the odd fact that almost all of the
“ancient” Egyptian inscriptions contain nothing but descriptions of funeral rites.
Therefore, according to our reconstruction, the ancient Egypt had been the cemetery for the kings
of the Great mediaeval Empire, and its inhabitants had to guard the peace of their deceased
rulers, which had been their primary task. This was naturally done at the expense of the vast
Imperial resources and not locally.
In Chron5 we also consider the issue of the construction of the pyramids. Egyptologists present us
with rather spectacular yet absolutely ephemeral pictures of how the pyramids and other colossal
stone constructions of the ancient Egypt were built. We are told about the great masses of
“ancient Egyptian slaves” who were supposed to cut gigantic blocks of stone weighing some 200
500 tonnes from mountain quarries using copper saws, no less. These monstrous blocks would
then be towed across the sand and transported over the Nile in some mysterious manner. Finally,
they would be used as bricks for the construction of the pyramids.
None of the above is likely to have taken place. The construction of the pyramids must have been
a much more interesting and realistic endeavour as opposed to the rather odd version related
above.
According to the new point of view, the technologies of the XIV-XVI century were used in the
Ancient Egypt, and rather complex ones, at that. Many of them were lost for many centuries after
the decline of the Empire in the XVII century, such as the geopolymer concrete (see [REC]:2). The
secret of this concrete was rediscovered several decades ago by Joseph Davidovich, the French
chemist. It is widely used in construction nowadays, qv in [1086] – [1093].
Let us conclude with the sentiment that one needn’t think that the Egyptian history ceases to be
“ancient” in the light of the New Chronology, since the latter shifts the history of all other
countries forwards as well, and considerably so. Egyptian history turns out to be the most ancient
of all as a result; however, the very definition of the “antiquity” changes due to its former
misinterpretation resulting from the use of the Scaligerian chronology.



According to the New Chronology, the oldest events whose traces remain in written history date
to the X-XIII century of the new era. The subsequent events of the XIV-XV century are ancient
enough, and we only have rather vague information about that epoch.
The ancient epoch ends with the introduction of Christianity in the XV century, which also differs
from the historical version of Scaliger a great deal since it had really been a reform of the existing
Christian church; however, this reform was significant enough for the subsequent version of
Christianity to have received the definition of a new religion.
This epoch was followed by the Ottoman conquest of the XV-XVI century, when the colonization
of America took place, for instance. The decline of the Great Empire took place after this, in the
beginning of the XVII century. The historical period to follow can be considered recent history. See
Chron6 and Chron7 for more details. Let us reiterate that in this chronological framework ancient
Egyptian history of the X-XVI century remains one of the oldest; however, there is nothing peculiar
about the fact that some of the “oldest” Egyptian customs had existed until the middle of the XIX
century.

The Egyptian zodiacs
1.
THE EGYPTIAN ZODIACS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR RELIABLE ASTRONOMICAL DATING
An Egyptian zodiac is a drawing with a symbolical representation of the celestial sphere. Such a
zodiac is done in a distinctive “ancient” Egyptian style and possesses a number of special
characteristics that will be discussed below. The very name “zodiac” reflects the fact that the
primary attention on these Egyptian drawings is focussed on the zodiacal part of the sky, or the
belt of the twelve zodiacal constellations (Aries, Taurus, Gemini etc).



Let us remind the reader that all the planets as well as the Moon move along the zodiacal belt,
and that the Sun is always located within the belt. It is naturally impossible to observe the Sun and
the stars simultaneously, since the latter cannot be seen during the day. Nevertheless, the
position of the sun among the stars is easy to guess at dust or at dawn, when one sees the bright
stars at sunrise.
Thus, the Zodiacal belt is the stellar track set by the motion of all the planets, likewise the Sun and
the Moon, as seen from the Earth. This fact is of exceptional importance in our case. It was known
rather well to the ancient astronomers who had used it for the creation of a rather special kind of
“celestial astral clock”, where the Zodiacal belt played the role of the dial, and planets served as
hands. This very “astral clock” was used for recording dates in Egyptian zodiacs.
It was done in the following manner: the positions of planets as well as the Sun and the Moon
would be symbolically drawn on the zodiacs, fixing the positions of planets in relation to the
constellations. Bear in mind that this disposition is in fact a horoscope, which is an “astral”
representation of a dating. It turns out that if an Egyptian zodiac should contain symbols or
planetary names, they serve to record a date transcribed as a horoscope.
Planetary positions on the celestial sphere change rather rapidly; therefore, a horoscope is very
soon replaced by another one. Recurrences do take place, but intervals between them usually
equal centuries or even millennia.
Modern calculation facilities allow to convert a horoscope into a date on the modern
chronological scale with sufficient ease. However, the answer might prove rather ambiguous due
to the fact that, very occasionally, a horoscope might recur; however, for most of them such
recurrences are a scarce enough event in order to give us the opportunity to date them reliably on
the interval of the last 2 or 3 millennia.
We shall give you a detailed account of how the Egyptian zodiacs are dated below. So far let us
merely reiterate that Egyptian zodiacs are in no way a mere embellishment; they represent a
certain date transcribed as certain symbols. Nowadays deciphering the astronomical symbols of
Egyptian zodiacs makes it feasible for us to learn the real time of their compilation, which, in turn,
makes it possible to answer the question of when the “ancient” Egyptians could really have lived
and built their “ancient” temples. In other words, the astronomical dating of the Egyptian zodiacs
allows the assessment of reliable and scientifically validated reference points in the chronology of
ancient Egypt.
We shall jump ahead and mention that all these reference points prove to be mediaeval. Most of
these “ancient” Egyptian zodiacal datings postdate the XII century A.D This concurs well with the



new chronology, according to which the earliest dates of written history of humankind date from
the epoch of the XI century A.D. the earliest.
Apparently, the zodiacal transcription of dates used to be very popular in Egypt. Even in our day,
“ancient” zodiacs are very popular there, and any tourist who might visit Egypt will be offered
countless papyri of modern manufacture in memorabilia shops, with multicolour copies of
“ancient” Egyptian artwork that will invariably have several zodiacs in their midst. One of such
zodiacs (purchased in Luxor in 2000) can be seen in fig. 12.1.
The most well-established Egyptian papyrus shops will be overjoyed to make an “ancient”
Egyptian zodiac for a client with the horoscope of the latter’s birthday, for instance, or any other
arbitrary date. Nowadays this requires no sky observations – all one needs is a computer and
some astronomical software that will instantly draw the star chart for any given day; then the data
in question are transferred to the papyrus as “ancient” Egyptian symbols, and the horoscope is
ready. It is possible that some of the “ancient” Egyptian zodiacs were manufactured in the XIX or
XVIII century and not the antiquity. Zodiacs may have still been part of a living tradition among
certain strata of Egyptian society at the time, especially considering as to how they bore direct
relation to funeral rites, as we shall see below, and funeral rites are known for their particular
longevity. Apart from that, zodiacs could be produced in the XIX century as forgeries for rich
European buyers, which is a possibility that one should not neglect. Therefore once we set about
dating some mind-bogglingly “ancient” Egyptian zodiac copied from a “doubtlessly exceptionally
old” Egyptian sepulchre, we should be prepared to come up with any date – for instance, it may
contain a ciphered XIX century dating. This is very much a possibility since the modern
archaeological methods of dating “ancient” Egyptian artefacts are unfounded – and, most likely,
blatantly incorrect. Egyptian tombs dated to times immemorial might be very recent in some of
the cases and even date to the XIX century. We shall run into several such occasions below.
The astronomical meaning of the symbols used in Egyptian zodiacs isn’t always obvious. In some
cases it only surfaces after a careful study. However, as a rule, Egyptian zodiacs can instantly be
told apart from other “ancient” Egyptian artwork by the following distinctive characteristic. In
nearly every case they contain the symbol of the celestial sphere drawn as a woman with her
arms lifted above her head. This woman often has an unnaturally extended body that spans the
zodiac. It is presumed that she represents the Egyptian goddess Nuit, or the “celestial goddess
([2], page 10; also [370], pages 14-15). See fig. 12.2. One can see a picture of Nuit from the
papyrus zodiac cited above in fig. 12.1.
Let us cite a few more examples of Egyptian zodiacs. We shall provide a more detailed study of all
Egyptian zodiacs below, as well as the symbols upon them. So far we would like to give the reader
a general idea of how an Egyptian zodiac might look.



In fig. 12.3 one sees an ancient drawing of the zodiac found in one of the royal sepulchres from
the “Theban” necropolis in Luxor. The drawing dates back to the epoch of Napoleon’s Egyptian
expedition. In general, this zodiac is done in the same style as the papyrus zodiac that one sees
above; however, we see the figure of Nuit divided in two. As we shall see from a series of
examples, this means that the zodiacal belt is split in two halves. One sees two respective rows of
figures upon the zodiac, one under the other, qv in fig. 12.3. Our calculations demonstrate the
date ciphered in this zodiac to be the 5-8 September 1182 A.D.
In fig. 12.4 we see a fragment of a ceiling relief carved in stone, depicting a zodiac with the size of
2.55 × 2.53 metres from the Egyptian temple of Dendera. This is one of the most famous Egyptian
zodiacs also known as the “Round Zodiac of Dendera” due to its shape and in order to
differentiate between it and the “Long” or “Rectangular” Zodiac of Dendera, which was found in
the same temple. The round zodiac of Dendera was discovered by the Europeans in 1799 during
the Napoleonic expedition ([1062], page 5) and later taken away to Paris ([1062], page 5; also
[544], Volume 6, page 651). The original of this zodiac is kept in the Louvre nowadays ([1062],
page 6), and there’s a copy in the actual temple. A drawn copy of the entire Round Zodiac as well
as the surrounding artwork can be seen in fig. 12.5. A photograph of the zodiac’s central part can
be seen in fig. 12.6, and that of Nuit the goddess from the same zodiac – in fig. 12.7.
In fig. 12.8 one sees a drawing of the Round Zodiac from the Napoleonic Egyptian album. The copy
is a very accurate one; however, the artwork is modified to some extent – the original looks a
great deal rougher. A modern drawn copy of the Round Zodiac can be seen in fig. 12.9. In order to
give the reader a better idea of what it really looks like, we also cite a magnified fragment of the
Napoleonic draft of the Round Zodiac in fig. 12.10. Once again we encounter Nuit as the symbol of
the celestial sphere, with both a front and a side view available (see figs. 12.5 and 12.8). However,
in this case Nuit isn’t part of the Zodiacal composition, but rather depicted separately nearby.
One can easily recognize the symbols of all twelve zodiacal constellations upon the Round Zodiac
of Dendera (see fig. 12.9). All the zodiacal constellations are drawn in the exact same way as one
sees them in the mediaeval European books on astronomy (Leo as a lion, Sagittarius as a centaur
holding a bow, Capricorn as a fable-like animal with the head of a goat and the tail of a fish etc).
N. A. Morozov, who had given this zodiac a scrupulous study, wrote the following: “I would like to
draw the reader’s attention to the fact that ... the Zodiacal constellations ... are drawn perfectly
well and comprise the ecliptic belt the way it is situated above the horizon – it is not concentric ...
to the equinoctial, but rather raised high above it in its summer constellation part with Cancer and
Gemini, and below in the opposite part with the winter constellations of Sagittarius and
Capricorn. The zodiac resembles the kind one sees on the astronomical maps of Beyer and even in
XIX century works on astronomy” ([544], Volume 6, page 658). As we can see, the author of the
Round Zodiac had a good knowledge of astronomy, since the zodiac itself is filled with



astronomical symbols of all sorts – virtually every symbol we see there has some astronomical
meaning.
Another zodiac was discovered in the very same Dendera Temple – the “Long” or the
“Rectangular” Zodiac of Dendera. Just like the Round Zodiac, it is a ceiling relief of a formidable
size consisting of two halves. Each of those equals 25 metres (see figs. 12.11, 12.12, 12.13 and
12.14. Halves of the Long Zodiac that represent the Zodiacal belt between the two of them are
located near the ceiling edges of a gigantic “hypostyle” hall (25 by 42.5 metres – see [370], page
162). The ceiling is covered by artwork that is predominantly astronomical in character and
content (see fig. 12.15). A modern photograph of a fragment of the Long Zodiac of Dendera can
be seen in fig. 12.16.
The decipherment and dating of the Round and the Long Zodiacs was contemplated in a great
number of works. In the XIX-XX century they were studied by Dupuis, Laplace, Fourier, Letronc,
Holm, Bio, Brugsch, B. A. Tourayev, N. A. Morozov ([544], Volume 6, pages 655-672), N. S. Kellin
and D. V. Denisenko ([376]), and also T. N. Fomenko ([912:3]). As a result, many various and,
basically, equally arbitrary datings came to existence. The dating of these zodiacs thus remained
ambiguous.
Our research demonstrates that apart from the primary horoscope, the Dendera zodiacs contain
auxiliary astronomical information which wasn’t taken into account by previous researchers. Once
the oversight is rectified, we come up with an absolute dating – namely, the horoscope of the
Round Zodiac of Dendera can be dated to the morning of the 20th March 1185 A.D., according to
our research. The horoscope of the Long Zodiac can be dated to the 22-26 April 1168 A.D., or 17
years earlier. See more about these datings in Chron3, Chapter 17.
Thus, we learn that the ancient Egyptian temple in Dendera was built in 1185 the earliest; most
possibly – a great deal later. Indeed, the date that we find ciphered on the ceiling of the temple
can hardly correspond to the time of the temple’s creation; it is more likely that the builders of
the temple adorned its ceiling with the date of some holy event – the one that the actual temple
was consecrated to, for instance. According to the New Chronology, the holy place of Dendera
that comprises the hypostyle hall with the Long zodiac, as well as the chamber with the Round
one, must have been built around the XIV-XV century A.D., which had been the epoch between
the Great = “Mongolian” conquest of the XIV century and the Ottoman = Ataman conquest of the
XV-XVI century, or, alternatively, the second half of the XVIII century when the Mamelukes seized
power in Egypt once again, albeit for a short while. In other words, these constructions must have
been erected by the Mamelukes.
Let us remind the reader that Egypt was conquered by the Ottomans (Atamans) in 1517, and that
the Mamelukes had ruled there earlier ([85], Volume 15, page 454). According to our



reconstruction, it was the Mamelukes that maintained the influence of the Great = “Mongonian”
Empire in Egypt. Their objective was to look after and to protect the grandiose royal cemetery of
the Great Empire. This cemetery probably comprised the pyramids, the temples and other
constructions related to the royal funeral rites in some way, qv in Chron5. In 1517 the Mamelukes
lost power in Egypt to the Ottomans (Atamans). Although our reconstruction implies both
Ottomans (Atamans) and Mamelukes to have originated from Russia-Horde, the epoch of the
Ottoman conquest made a great many old customs and traditions of the Great = “Mongolian”
Empire change to a great extent. These changes resulted from great embroilment, possibly
accompanied by drastic dynastic changes in the XV century Empire, qv in Chron5. Therefore, the
Ottomans (Atamans) could have persecuted certain old traditions of the Great Empire, destroying
the “heretical” old temples and building new ones after a new fashion.
However, 250 years after the Ottoman (Ataman) conquest of Egypt, in 1766, the Mamelukes had
once again managed to concentrate full power over Egypt in their hands. They had retained it for
30 years, up until Napoleon’s expedition ([85], Volume 15, page 454). It is therefore possible that
some of these “ancient” Egyptian temples really date to the second half of the XVIII century and
were deliberately built in the “ancient Egyptian” (Mameluke) style, yet with all the technical
achievements of the XVIII century employed. The Mamelukes may have tried to revive some of
their old traditions in the XVIII century. In particular, they may have resumed the construction of
temples with zodiacs indicating the years of holy or famous ancient events. Bear in mind that the
Mamelukes hadn’t been eradicated until 1811 ([85], Volume 15, page 455). Many “ancient”
Egyptian traditions must have been wiped out as a consequence, and later dated to deep
antiquity by the historians.
Another example is as follows. In fig. 12.17 we cite a drawn copy of the Egyptian zodiac
discovered by the famous Egyptologist Heinrich Brugsch on the inside of the lid of an “ancient”
Egyptian wooden sarcophagus ([544], Volume 6, page 695). Here the symbol of the sky (the
goddess Nuit) looks like a woman with her hands lifted above her head. She is dressed in a tunic
and located in the centre of the picture, with the Zodiac to the left and to the right. The symbols
used for zodiacal constellations are once again easily recognizable. They are situated along Nuit’s
body. On the left of fig. 12.17 we see the symbols for Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and
Sagittarius, whereas the symbols for Capricorn (with shaded head), Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus
(shaded) and Gemini are on the right. The order of Zodiacal constellations is specified correctly,
being the very same order they have on the celestial sphere. Furthermore, Heinrich Brugsch
discovered demotic subscripts with the names of planets in this zodiac; these names are written
explicitly between the figures of Zodiacal constellations. Brugsch managed to read them (see
[376]; also [544], Volume 6, page 697) and estimate the places of planets in constellations. In
other words, the zodiac of Brugsch contains the legible “subscript horoscope”, which makes it
feasible to date the zodiac in question astronomically.



The dating of the “subscript horoscope” from Brugsch’s zodiac was first calculated by N. A.
Morozov, yielding an astonishing result – 1682 A.D., the XVII century! The second possible
solution (that of 18 October 1861) had been rejected by Morozov due to its being “too recent”,
since in 1862 Brugsch had already published a drawing of this zodiac in [1054]. However, we have
discovered that apart from the “subscript horoscope”, there are two more actual horoscopes on
Brugsch’s zodiac that represent an integral part of the latter. Therefore, today we can
complement and clear up the conclusions made by N. A. Morozov in re the dating of Brugsch’s
zodiac. Below we tell the reader about this most noteworthy zodiac and its dating in full detail.
We shall jump ahead and report that the dates ciphered in this zodiac (without accounting for the
more recent subscript horoscope) are 6-7 October 1841 and 15 February 1853.
Therefore, the solution of 1861 is the one that becomes the most plausible one for the “subscript
horoscope” – the year preceded the publication of Brugsch immediately. One of the Egyptians
must have played a practical joke on Brugsch and drawn a horoscope for 1861 in demotic style, à
la “Ancient Egypt” on the zodiac before demonstrating it to the “famous ideologist” in full
realization that the latter wouldn’t even conceive of looking for the astronomical dating of the
“ancient” zodiac in the present year – or even the future, several years later. See fig. 12.17 where
the subscripts near the constellation figures to the left of Nuit’s body can be seen with sufficient
clarity.
In fig. 12.18 one sees a drawn copy of a zodiac from one of the ancient towns in the Egyptian
town of Esna (Isna). The old name of this town is Latopolis ([1100]). The present zodiac was
also included into the Napoleonic Egyptian album, which is where we copied it from ([1100]). Let
us refer to it as to the “Greater Zodiac” of Esna in order to distinguish it from the other zodiac,
which was also found in Esna, but in a smaller table. A fragment of a shaded drawn copy of this
zodiac from the Napoleonic album ([1100]) can be seen in fig. 12.19. See more about this zodiac
and its dating below, in Chron3, Chapter 18. As we shall see, the date ciphered on this zodiac
pertains to the end of the XIV century A.D., no less.
Another zodiac discovered in the small temple in the north of Esna is shown in fig. 12.20. It was
also borrowed from the Napoleonic album in question ([1220]). We shall be referring to it as to
the “Lesser Zodiac” of Esna (see more about this zodiac and its dating below). It turns out that the
date ciphered herein is a XV-century one – namely, 1404 A.D.
Let us now tell the reader about the two zodiacs found in an artificial Egyptian burial cave at some
point in the beginning of the XX century. Below, in fig. 13.9, one sees a drawn copy of these
zodiacs. The cave with the zodiacs was discovered by the English archaeologist Flinders Petrie
during his excavations in Athribis (a site in Upper Egypt, close to the town of Sohag – see [544],
Volume 6, page 728). Two zodiacs were found on the ceiling of the cave, coloured in different



hues ([544], Volume 6, page 729). Flinders Petrie provided a drawn copy of these zodiacs in
[1340:1] presuming them to date from the beginning of the new era. See also Volume 14 of the
British School of Archaeology in Egypt Courier with Flinders Petrie’s article about the Athribis
excavations of 1901.
The zodiacs of Athribis were studied by the English astronomer A. B. Knobel for the purposes of
dating, and then also by M. A. Vilyev and N. A. Morozov ([544], Volume 6, pages 728-752).
However, they had to go for far-fetching explanations in their attempts to decipher and date the
zodiacs of Athribis. The reason for this shall be explained below. As a result, there wasn’t a single
astronomical solution found that would satisfy to the symbols found on the zodiacs of Athribis
completely anywhere in the works mentioned above. Our research demonstrated that such a
solution does in fact exist and it is the only one possible – it turns out that the Athribis zodiacs
date to the XIII century A.D. (1230 for the Upper Zodiac and 1268 for the Lower Zodiac).
Therefore, the date of their creation cannot predate the XIII century.
Let us point out that up until very recently no final dating of the Athribis zodiacs could be made
since the volume of calculations required for this purpose happens to be too great to be
performed manually, without the aid of modern computer technology. However, all of the
researchers mentioned above were confined to manual calculus and therefore had to introduce
certain additional reasonable presumptions that would provide for curbing the volume of
calculations to some extent. Unfortunately, these presumptions proved erroneous. Therefore, N.
A. Morozov, for instance, who hadn’t been bound by the Scaligerian chronology, still didn’t
manage to find a correct answer for the Athribis zodiacs.
In fig. 12.12 we see an example of an Egyptian zodiac where the constellations are represented as
usual symbols, and the planets as half-length portraits. This zodiac was discovered in the middle
of the XX century in the “ancient” Egyptian “Sepulchre of Petosiris”, on the ceiling of the inner
chamber ([1291], page 97).
Horoscopes are not contained in all Egyptian zodiacs. Some of them only possess Zodiacal
constellation symbols sans planets. Such zodiacs cannot be dated astronomically as a rule due to
the lack of horoscopes with dates ciphered therein. Approximate dating of such zodiacs is only
possible if one is to compare them to similar ones, which do nonetheless permit to date them. An
example of a horoscope-less zodiac can be seen in fig. 12.22. There are no planets on this zodiac
just zodiacal constellations.
There are certain examples of ancient Egyptian zodiacs containing less than twelve zodiacal
constellations whose symbols differ from the ones used nowadays to a great extent
nevertheless, one can trace the general similarity well enough – see fig. 12.23, for instance; one
can see an ancient Egyptian schist slate called the Libyan palette. It is most likely to be a zodiac



where the constellations are represented as seven walled cities with the corresponding
constellation symbol drawn above each of these cities (Leo, Scorpio etc) measuring its
constellation with the use of a goniometric tool resembling a pair of dividers. Such instruments
were in fact used in astronomy – the “ancient” astronomer Ptolemy would often be drawn with
one of those, qv above in figs. 0.1 and 11.27. Even Copernicus had used a similar instrument by
the name of “triquetrum” ([926], page 55). See fig. 11.26 above.
It is possible that such zodiacs are the oldest ones, manufactured in epochs when the division of
the ecliptic into constellations hadn’t assumed its modern form as to yet; it is possible that there
were less zodiacal constellations at the time than nowadays. One finds echoes of this in the
Almagest, for instance, where the constellation of Libra is called “The Claws of Scorpio” in the star
catalogue; even though it is considered an independent constellation, the very name indicates
that it may have once been part of the Scorpio constellation.
It is curious that one sees the constellation of Corvus in fig. 12.23. It is located next to Leo, which
is where one would see either Cancer or Virgo nowadays. The actual constellation exists until the
present day; however, it does not belong to the zodiacal belt, albeit a neighbour of the Virgo
constellation. Nevertheless, in this Egyptian zodiac it is explicitly marked as a zodiacal
constellation. We therefore see that in certain ancient Egyptian zodiacs the zodiacal constellations
would be indicated different from the modern custom. However, in most of the Egyptian zodiacs
the figures of zodiacal constellations are rather standard and hardly differ from their modern
counterparts at all.
In fig. 12.24 we see a fragment of an old zodiac from the Slavic Izbornik Svyatoslava (Svyatoslav’s
Almanac) allegedly dating to 1073. The constellation of Pisces is represented by a single fish here
and not by a pair, the way it is customary today.
2.
THE ASTRONOMICAL DATING OF EGYPTIAN ZODIACS AND RELATED DIFFICULTIES.
The reasons why the Egyptologists eschew the astronomical dating of the zodiacs
To evade miscomprehension, let us point out right away that every reference to the “Scaligerian
chronology” in the present work doesn’t attribute the datings to Scaliger himself, but his followers
as well, or everyone who used the works of Scaliger as basis for the creation of the consensual
version of history that proved erroneous, qv in Chron1.
We already mentioned that if an old zodiac contains indications of planetary positions, or a
horoscope, it must contain some ciphered date. Nowadays these dates can be deciphered with
the aid of computational astronomy – or, at least, suggest several versions of its dating, which is



what the very concept of dating the Egyptian zodiacs astronomically is based upon. This idea is far
from new. In the end of the XVIII – beginning of the XIX century, when the Europeans had secured
access to Egypt for the first time, they discovered a large amount of zodiacs there. Some of the
Egyptian zodiacs (the most impressive ones) were copied by Napoleon’s artists and published in
the Napoleonic album on Egypt ([1100]). They are directly referred to as “astronomical tables” or
“sculptural zodiacs” there – see [1100], A. Vol. I, Pl. 79, or A. Vol. II, Pl. 82, for instance. Thus, the
astronomical nature of the Egyptian zodiacs has never been doubted. Quite understandably, one
would come up with the idea of dating these zodiacs astronomically, or employing horoscopes for
this purpose. European astronomers of the XIX century have performed some calculations for this
purpose.
However, since the astronomers had to conform to the orders of the historians, they also
operated within the Scaligerian framework of Egyptian chronology. However, this is where
astronomy contradicted Scaligerian chronology blatantly. No dating that would satisfy the
Scaligerites has ever been found. Let us linger on this for a while, starting with the mention that
nearly all the Egyptian zodiacs date to the epoch of Roman rule in Egypt, according to historians,
or the beginning of the new era ([1017:1], page 38). In the earliest stages, attempts were made to
date these zodiacs to even more distant epochs. Historians would try to date the Dendera zodiacs
to an epoch preceding the new era by 15.000 years, no less ([544], Volume 6, page 651).
However, these exceptionally “attractive” datings of Egyptian zodiacs must have been
complicated by the all too obvious similarity between the astronomical symbols used in Egypt and
in Europe, and so in order to insist that Egyptian zodiacs predate the new era by hundreds and
thousands of years one would have to explain the reason why the drawings of constellations on
these exceptionally ancient Egyptian zodiacs coincide with the pictures in mediaeval European
books on astronomy in finest detail. Dating the Egyptian zodiacs to the beginning of the new era
would make the problem a great deal less serious, since this dating allows to make claims that
both the “ancient” Egyptians and the mediaeval Europeans borrowed their astronomical symbols
from the Romans, hence the similarity. Shifting the dates forward from the first centuries of the
new era would also prove a non-option for the Scaligerite experts in Egyptian history since the
Scaligerian chronology is of the opinion that the history of the “ancient” Egypt ceases shortly after
the beginning of the new era. The zodiacs that one discovers in the “doubtlessly ancient” Egyptian
temples and sepulchres cannot be dated to an epoch post-dating the first A.D. centuries within
the framework of Scaligerian chronology.
As a result, possible (according to the Scaligerites) datings of ancient Egyptian zodiacs turn out
hemmed in the narrow interval of 200-300 years the longest – a century before the beginning of
the new era, or possibly a century or two after. Too great a distance between the hypothetical
dating and the boundaries of this interval begins to contradict the entire Scaligerian



concept of “ancient” Egyptian history and chronology rather explicitly.
However, it turns out that this period has got absolutely nothing to do with the astronomical
datings of the Egyptian zodiacs, since a calculating astronomer has no leeway at all in order to try
and make the datings fit, since one and the same horoscope can only recur after prolonged
intervals of time and happen once or twice a millennium. Some planetary combinations can only
recur over the course of several thousand years; therefore, making a given zodiac fit the short
time interval specified by historians proved too hard, no matter how lenient the criteria for
“fitting”. All these complications arose from the fact that the interval was specified wrongly.
The result was that the Egyptologists basically gave upon the idea of dating the Egyptian zodiacs
by their astronomical content. Discussing the symbolic content of the Egyptian zodiacs, they try to
present it as “astronomical fantasies” of ancient artists, often not even trying to decipher and
date the rediscovered Egyptian zodiac.
A vivid example is [1291], a work by famous specialists in the field of studying the astronomical
texts of ancient Egypt – O. Neugebauer, R. A. Parker and D. Pingree. In their analysis of the zodiacs
from the ceilings of two ancient Egyptian sepulchres belonging to Petosiris and Petubastis, the
authors of [1291] write the following, for instance: “The positioning of the planets seems to be
inspired by Mithraism” ([1291], p. 100). In other words, they reject the idea that the zodiacs
contain real horoscopes, which may be dated – there isn’t a single mention of such a possibility
anywhere in [1291]. Nevertheless, the two zodiacs of Petosiris considered in said work contain
horoscopes, which can be dated astronomically. It is just one of the three zodiacs that contains no
horoscope and therefore no ciphered date – that of Petubastis, qv in fig. 12.22.
Let us emphasize that it isn’t any random planetary dislocation against the background of zodiacal
constellations that can be treated as a horoscope, which can really manifest on the celestial
sphere. Planetary motion is subject to certain laws. For example, Venus and Mercury as seen from
the Earth cannot be located too far away from the Sun, and hence from each other as well.
A fantasy artist distributing planets across constellations randomly is most likely to break these
laws and draw an unreal fantasy horoscope. However, Egyptian zodiacs, and, particularly, the
zodiacs of Petosiris considered in [1291], contain real horoscopes. Why would the authors of
[1291] have to present us with vague ruminations on Mithraism affecting the planetary symbols
on the Zodiacs instead of analyzing their astronomical content? Could it be due to the fact that
they didn’t even hope to come up with a solution that would correspond to the Scaligerian
chronology? Indeed, neither the zodiac of Petosiris nor any other Egyptian zodiacs have such
solutions.



Let us take a look at what is written on the subject of dating Egyptian zodiacs astronomically in
the description of the British Museum’s Egyptian collection published in 1924, for instance
([1050:1]). We find nothing at all. The authors report nothing about the astronomical datings of
the zodiacs found on these coffins when they tell us about the alleged dates when the “ancient”
Egyptian sarcophagi from the collection of the British Museum were manufactured, as if these
horoscopes didn’t matter at all. Each and every dating we find in [1050:1] is given out of
considerations that have got absolutely nothing to do with astronomical dating.
For example, when the authors of [1050:1] describe an allegedly “mind-bogglingly ancient”
wooden coffin from Egypt, they tell us that “the face resembles the face of the ordinary stone
Sidonian sarcophagus, of which those of Tabnith and Eshmunazar, King of Sidon, B.C. 360 ... are
typical examples, and for this reason the date of the coffin is supposed to lie between B.C. 500
and B.C. 350” ([1050:1], page 133).
However, right here in [1050:1] we find the following description of the artwork that decorates
the coffin lid – it depicts “numerous astronomical texts and pictures ... Here we have figures of the
gods of the constellations, and of the planets, Signs of the Zodiac ...” ([1050:1], page 133). In other
words, what we have before us is a zodiac with a horoscope, yet the issue of dating this
horoscope astronomically is ignored altogether. This is very typical. Not a single Egyptian zodiac
out of those mentioned in [1050:1] was dated astronomically or so much as represented. There
isn’t a single word about such datings anywhere in the very detailed description of the British
Museum’s Egyptian collection ([1050:1] – [1050:3]), despite the fact that the actual presence of
the zodiacs is accurately pointed out.
A vivid example of the abovementioned situation with the datings of Egyptian zodiacs is given by
the history of the astronomical dating of the two zodiacs from the Dendera temple. We already
mentioned one of them above – the Round Zodiac. This is what N. A. Morozov wrote in re the
zodiacs from Dendera: “The first Egyptologists dated the Temple of Dendera to fifteen thousand
years before Christ, no less; their children dated it to three thousand years before the new era,
and their grandchildren had to admit that the Rectangular Zodiac dates to the reign of Tiberius
(14-36 A.D.), and the Round Zodiac – to the reign of Nero (before 60 A.D.). When they tried to
prove all these datings by astronomical calculations, the results obtained were negative.
The consecutive works of Dupuis, Laplace, Fourier, Letron, Holm, Bio and other later researchers
demonstrated that the horoscopes in question cannot predate the III century A.D. One had to
either date the imperial Roman reigns to a different epoch, also ascribing a different geographical
location to it, or, alternatively, to declare the horoscopes pure fantasy. The Egyptologists were
reluctant to revise the tradition and opted for the latter despite the fact that the veracity of both
horoscopes is blatantly obvious” ([544], Volume 6, page 651).



After an attentive study of these zodiacs, N. A. Morozov makes the following conclusion:
“Should all of the above to be artistic fantasy, it is very difficult to explain why both Mercury and
Venus occupy their rightful position near the Sun in both zodiacs rather than winding up
somewhere else, in a location convenient for the artists, but perfectly impossible? Why would one
draw such a fantasy horoscope in the first place? Nonsense! This horoscope isn’t “fantasy” in any
way – it is perfectly real ...” ([544], Volume 6, page 653).
We shall come back to N. A. Morozov’s analysis of the Dendera zodiacs in Chapter 17 of Chron3
and tell the reader about it in more detail. Morozov had been the first to suggest dating the
Egyptian zodiacs by their astronomical content regardless of the Scaligerian chronology. All the
researchers who preceded Morozov tried their hardest to come up with a solution that would lie
in the a priori specified late B.C. – early A.D. interval, which would either prove impossible or next
to impossible, requiring all sorts of approximations and arbitrary measures to become more or
less fitting.
Whether or not it is a coincidence, but all the earnest attempts of the Egyptologists to use
astronomy for the dating of Egyptian zodiacs ceased de facto after the publication of N. A.
Morozov’s works where he proves the impossibility of dating the Egyptian zodiacs the way
Egyptologists want them to be dated – all the resultant datings are mediaeval ([544], Volume 6).
This contradicts the consensual chronology of Egypt.
It has to be said that N. A. Morozov’s works on the astronomical dating of the zodiacs contained a
number of minor flaws, which will be analyzed in detail below. However, there were a lot less of
those in Morozov’s work than in any of the ones that preceded it, since the authors of the latter
would do everything they could in order to make the resultant datings correspond to the
Scaligerian chronology of Egypt. The works of Morozov prove that once we become a little more
demanding precision-wise, the astronomical datings irreversibly shift forwards, into the Middle
Ages.
We therefore have to repeat our question – is it a chance occurrence that the activity of the
Egyptologists in the field of dating the Egyptian zodiacs astronomically receded greatly after the
publication of Morozov’s works? Nowadays they do their best to evade astronomy while
discussing Egyptian zodiacs and to change the subject of the conversation as soon as possible. The
solution of an actual problem formulated as deciphering the astronomical content of the zodiacs
and their meticulous dating is substituted by an obfuscating discussion of ancient Egyptian
religion, which is the safest option for Scaligerian chronology. The matter is presented in such a
light that even if the Egyptian zodiac symbols rear any relation to astronomy at all, they are
extremely naïve and fantastical ([1291] and [320]).



However, our research (which follows in the footsteps of N. A. Morozov’s research, for instance)
demonstrates that the Scaligerian chronology rests upon a foundation of thin air, and is most
likely to be highly erroneous, qv in Chron1 and Chron2. Therefore, N. A. Morozov’s approach to
the dating of Egyptian zodiacs without accounting for the Scaligerian chronology appears to be a
perfectly correct one. However, this approach runs into a new hindrance, and a significant one. It
becomes manifest as soon as we expand the time interval of acceptable datings to make it span a
millennium or more – the historical epoch that comprises the “antiquity” and the Middle Ages, in
other words. The resulting dates are very ambiguous. The reason is as follows.
Once we reject the a priori set narrow time interval for the horoscope datings, we must take into
account every astronomical solution on the entire historical interval length, or roughly two
thousand years, which is a long enough time interval allowing for multiple recurrence of many
zodiacs. This spawns several valid solutions for every zodiac, complicating the dating as a result,
since it is perfectly unclear how a single correct dating could be identified amidst a number of
variants.
It has to be said that if we had to consider a shorter timeframe of 2-3 centuries, the probability of
several possible solutions for a single zodiac manifesting within an interval this brief would be very
low. Therefore, a correctly specified short interval would be most likely to yield a single possible
solution for each zodiac. However, should the interval turn out to be specified incorrectly, there
won’t be any fitting solutions in most cases, and this is precisely what we see to be the case with
the Scaligerian time interval for Egyptian horoscopes for which we find no satisfactory solutions.
However, even if we’re fortunate and the horoscope of our zodiac proved successful enough to
possess a single possible solution on the entire historical interval, the problem retains. The matter
is that all attempts to decipher Egyptian zodiacs are still afflicted by ambiguity, even in cases when
the symbols can be deciphered unequivocally and reliably.
One must point out that a great number of Egyptian zodiacs can be deciphered with no ambiguity
whatsoever. The names of the planets are given in writing on some of them; these inscriptions
can be read in order to realize what planet exactly this or the other zodiacal symbol stands for.
Some of the planetary figures recur on different zodiacs and can therefore be told apart securely
when compared to each other. Below we shall describe this procedure in more detail.
Nevertheless, deciphering the Egyptian zodiacs always results in ambiguities of some sort
concerning a planet or two, for instance. There are many reasons for this – sometimes it happens
due to the fact that the symbol for a given planet isn’t known to us from other zodiacs, or because
the planetary symbol in question is new and wasn’t encountered earlier; the condition of the
symbol may also be poor enough to render it completely unidentifiable. It is also possible that a
zodiac might not specify a planet’s position explicitly enough to identify this planet – there are



certain other reasons as well. For certain zodiacs that utilize complex, convoluted or extremely
abstract symbols one has to go through all possible identification versions of the planetary figures,
which results in dozens of possible ways to decipher such a zodiac, with several hundred possible
solutions. In other cases there are just two or three variants. However, whether or not there are
multiple ways to decipher a given zodiac, none of them are free from ambiguity. Even if the
general picture is clear, certain variations are still possible, which leads to several solution
possibilities.
3.
OUR NEW APPROACH TO THE DATING OF EGYPTIAN ZODIACS
The abovementioned problems are instantly solved by the new method of deciphering and dating
the Egyptian zodiacs as proposed by the authors. Namely, we suggest the formal approach that
permits a decipherment of the zodiac itself as well as the additional information, which is usually
inherent therein. This extra information usually suffices for us to reject all the unnecessary
solutions and define the date for a given zodiac quite unambiguously.
Let us emphasize that the solution turns out unambiguous even if we are to consider a certain
vagueness of the primary horoscope, as well as the secondary information that it contains.
Furthermore, even if the primary horoscope was deciphered with errors for some reason, the
secondary information it contains is most likely to render the incorrectly deciphered version void
of solution since when we have too many astronomical conditions to account for, their chance
combination upon the real celestial sphere becomes highly improbable, even considering the
multitude of possible interpretations that arise when we attempt to decipher the Egyptian zodiac.
A detailed description of our method is given in the subsequent sections. Bear in mind that the
method in question allows us to work with all possible options of deciphering the Egyptian
zodiacs, which the previous approach did not permit. The volume of necessary calculations will
naturally grow, since one has to perform them for several horoscope variants for each zodiac.
Each one of those can generate a whole series of acceptable solutions on the historical interval.
The total number of solutions for a single zodiac can approach and even exceed a hundred. Each
one of them needs to be tested for correspondence with the zodiac’s secondary astronomical
data.
This procedure is impossible without modern computers and state-of-the-art astronomical
software. Furthermore, we had to develop a separate computer program for this purpose. It is
called HOROS and serves the purpose of searching all the dates from the historical interval for real
manifestations of given planet dispositions in zodiacal constellations (horoscopes). The zodiacal
belt dispositions of planet in relation to each other are also considered. Since there can be several



ways of reading data from a zodiac, this software accounts for possible ambiguity in the
distribution of planets across the constellations as well as the mutual planetary order. See
Annexes 2, 3 and 4 for a description of the HOROS software, and also Chron3, Chapter 16.
For approximated calculations we used the simple and convenient application called Turbo-Sky
and developed by A. Volynkin, a Muscovite astronomer. It was employed to estimate the visibility
conditions for the calculated dates from the Egyptian zodiacs – in particular, the luminosity of
planets for a given time moment, which is very important in order to assess whether or not the
planet in question can be observed with the naked eye. Let us mention that the luminosity of a
planet as seen from the Earth is largely dependent on the distance between said planet and the
Sun, which can oscillate wildly over the course of time. See Chron3, Chapter 16, for more
information.

THE FUNEREAL CHARACTER OF ZODIACS IN EGYPT
“Most of the surviving artefacts [from Ancient Egypt – Auth.], as well as the inscriptions found
upon them ... are of a religious character. Out of the papyri that had reached our day, about 9/10
happen to have religious content ... all this material lacks diversity, since it deals with the funereal
rites that had existed at the time” ([965], page 101).
Let us enquire why the ancient Egyptians would draw zodiacs with ciphered dates? Although this
issue doesn’t bear any direct relation to the problem of dating the Egyptian zodiacs astronomically
that we’re considering presently, it is related to it implicitly.
Indeed, let us suppose that we managed to discover the astronomical dating of some old Egyptian
zodiac. What could this dating possibly stand for? If a certain zodiac was discovered upon the
ceiling of an “ancient” Egyptian temple, could the date ciphered therein stand for the
approximate date of this temple’s construction? A propos, this is exactly how N. A. Morozov
suggested to interpret the astronomical datings of the Dendera zodiacs. He was of the opinion
that they contained “the date when the construction of these parts of the building began, or,
perhaps, the time they were made open for the public” ([544], Volume 6, page 653). However, our
opinion differs from Morozov’s.
Let us pay attention to the following circumstance. The “ancient” Egyptian zodiacs are almost
always explicitly linked to burials. Let us peruse the description of the British Museum’s Egyptian
collection, for instance ([1050:1], [1050:2] and [1050:3]). Nearly all of the Egyptian zodiacs
mentioned in these descriptions are drawn upon the inside of the “ancient” Egyptian coffin lids.
The zodiacs cover the mummy, in a way; they are drawn so as to be as close to the mummy as



possible. Therefore, the dating ciphered in such a zodiac is most likely to bear direct relation to
the deceased, being the year of his birth, or death, for instance – or both, if there are several
horoscopes in a zodiac (which is the case sometimes).
There are several “ancient” Egyptian sarcophagi made of wood in the collection of the British
Museum with zodiacs drawn upon them. Four of them are mentioned in the description of the
third room containing the Egyptian collection ([1050:1], pages 126 and 133). We see one such
sarcophagus in fig. 12.25. It is covered with a curved wooden lid with decorations; a similar coffin
sans lid can be seen in fig. 12.26. A closer look tells us that these “ancient” Egyptian coffins were
made of smooth and well-planed planks of wood. Furthermore, the planks are mortised together
– the woodwork method in question might as well be modern (see fig. 12.27). Such coffins are
unlikely to have been manufactured in absence of iron axes, planes and chisels – yet we are told
that the “ancient” Egyptian makers of these coffins had nothing but copper tools at their disposal.
The decorations can be found both on the inside and the outside of Egyptian coffins, qv in fig.
12.27.
In their description of a typical “ancient” Egyptian coffin, the authors of the Egyptian collection’s
description ([1050:1]) inform us that the inside of a coffin’s lid would usually be decorated with a
drawing of the goddess Nuit symbolizing the celestial sphere as well as the twelve signs of the
“Greek Zodiac” ([1050:1], page 32). In other words, the sarcophagi were decorated with Egyptian
zodiacs. It is just one of the horoscopes mentioned in [1050:1]-[1050:3] that was drawn on a piece
of glass and not a coffin – and one without a horoscope at that, since it only contains the twelve
constellation symbols ([1050:2], page 88).
Thus, we see that nearly all of the Egyptian zodiacs kept in the Egyptian collection of the British
museum are zodiacs drawn for burials upon the inside of lids covering the “ancient” Egyptian
coffins. Let us note that most of the Egyptian zodiacs that we were alluding to above are also
related to funeral rites. Brugsch’s horoscope is drawn on a coffin lid, and the horoscopes of
Athribis – upon the ceiling of a cave used for burials. Zodiacs in figs. 12.1 and 12.3 come from the
ceilings of the sepulchres in the Valley of Kings near Luxor. The zodiacs of Petosiris and Petubastis
are also drawn upon ceilings of crypts.
One gets a distinct impression that the Egyptian zodiacs were part of the funeral rites. It would
make sense to assume that they were used for recording the dates related to the deceased – the
dates of his birth and death and, possibly, some other ones considered important.
But why would these dates have to be ciphered in a horoscope and not written normally? The
“ancient” Egyptians who drew the horoscopes upon the ceilings of their sepulchres must have
been well-versed in chronological issues already, realizing that the usual everyday method of date
transcription (counted from the beginning of some reign, or according to some era) is far from



eternal; some new reference point for the beginning of an era may eventually be introduced, and
the old one forgotten. Or, alternatively, the letters and numbers used for transcribing a date
might eventually alter to a great extent, which would render the usual dating incomprehensible
for the descendants. Therefore, another method of transcribing the dates for the dead was
required – an “eternal” method, as it were. The horoscope was chosen as such a method, or the
distribution of planets across zodiacal constellations. Astronomy must have been evolved to a
sufficient extent by that time for people to realise that the recurrence of a zodiac on a celestial
sphere is a very rare occurrence indeed; another implication is that one could really use the
method in question in order to transcribe a date. Such a transcription would be “eternal as the sky
itself ”.
Thus, the astronomical dating of a zodiac drawn upon the lid of an Egyptian coffin, or upon the
ceiling of an Egyptian burial cave (sepulchre) can really be considered as the approximate burial
date. Naturally, one should not exclude the possibility that the date ciphered in the funereal
zodiac had absolutely nothing to do with the birth or the death of the deceased and was related
to some famous predecessor of his – the founder of his lineage, perhaps, with the zodiac
calculated for his epoch in reverse. However, such cases must have been rather rare if they took
place at all, and so the date of the horoscopes found on most Egyptian sepulchres can be
considered to relate to either the birth or the death of the deceased; it is thus the approximate
dating of the burial. On the other hand, if it isn’t a sepulchre that the horoscope is drawn upon,
but rather a temple, it would be unlikely to refer to this temple’s construction date. Let us
expound this idea.
The date of a temple’s construction as well as the circumstances related thereto in general don’t
usually occupy a crucial place in the murals of said temple, let alone ceiling artwork. The events
depicted in temples with the utmost care and attention are usually the ones that the temple had
been built to commemorate; they must have been old enough by the time of the temple’s
construction, since temples are usually built to commemorate ancient events and decorated
accordingly – even in cases when the temple is built to commemorate a more or less recent event.
The zodiacs discovered in the “ancient” Egyptian temples of Dendera and Esna are large reliefs
carved in stone and placed on the ceiling of the temples’ central chambers where they could be
seen by everyone. If we are to make a comparison with the Russian temples, for instance, the
Egyptian zodiacs will correspond to the artwork under the dome, which never tells the tale of the
temple’s construction.
Therefore, the most plausible assumption is that the datings on the zodiacs found in Egyptian
temples relate to the life of the saint that the temple in question was built to commemorate and
indicate the day of this saint’s death, or other important events related to this character.



For instance, if the ancient Egyptian temple was dedicated to the Nativity of Christ, a zodiac with
Christ’s birth date could easily be painted on the ceiling of this temple. The builders of the temple
didn’t have to remember the disposition of the planets for the day of the Nativity; the planetary
disposition for the required date (horoscope) is most likely to have been calculated in reverse,
which is a rather easy task due to the fact that planetary positions are given very roughly; it
suffices for a given planet to be withing the confines of a zodiacal constellation. Therefore the
calculation of a horoscope didn’t require anything more esoteric than the knowledge of Ptolemy’s
planetary theory. This task was perfectly feasible for the mediaeval and “ancient” astronomers.
Therefore, the dating of a zodiac from an Egyptian temple as opposed to a zodiac from a
sepulchre cannot serve for the dating of the actual temple. Nevertheless, it does serve to provide
the bottom line of the latter. It is obvious that the temple could not have been built earlier than
the date contained in its zodiac. However, it could have been built later than that date, and
probably a great deal later as well – several centuries later, perhaps.
5. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE EGYPTIAN ZODIACS AS USED BY THE AUTHORS
The analysis of symbols used in Egyptian zodiacs as well as deciphering them shall require
attention to the tiniest details. According to our research, small and seemingly insignificant details
of a zodiac, as well as the mutual disposition of the symbols upon it, often turns out to be of
paramount importance, capable of affecting how the zodiac in question is deciphered. Therefore
it is vital for the purposes of astronomical dating that the representations of the zodiacs be as
detailed and as clear as possible. The best option is high-resolution colour photographs.
Unfortunately, so much as procuring photograph turned out impossible in a number of cases.
Finding quality photographs of certain Egyptian zodiacs, even famous ones, proved a very difficult
endeavour.
Could this be a chance occurrence? Above we already mentioned the fact that modern
Egyptologists are prone to treating Egyptian zodiacs as astronomical fantasy. At the same time,
one finds modern publications with detailed and high-quality representations of the zodiacs to be
next to nonexistent.
In other words, there are almost no publications in existence that would permit to date these
zodiacs astronomically. Even if one manages to find published photographs of the zodiacs, they
are either of very poor quality, or only contain fragments of zodiacs. Exceptions do exist, but they
are few and far between.
Could we be facing a case of “extreme care” about the integrity of the Scaligerian chronology from
the part of the Egyptologists, which could explain their reluctance to publish materials that
represent a potential basis for non-Scaligerian datings? After all, in the XIX and the beginning of



the XX century, when the Egyptologists had still cherished the hope of confirm the Scaligerian
chronology of Egypt with the aid of astronomical dating, they got to publish a great many high
quality and detailed prints of Egyptian zodiacs – see [1100], [1340:1] and [1054]. We studied all of
these prints, and they shall be reproduced below.
Very high-quality and detailed reproductions of several Egyptian zodiacs are contained in the
Napoleonic description of Egypt ([1100]). It was published in France in the beginning of the XIX
century in the wake of the Napoleonic expedition to Egypt that had taken place in 1798-1801. We
were using a modern reprint ([1100]). In our research we have used all the painted, drawn and
photographic copies of the Egyptian zodiacs as listed below.
1) The Round Zodiac of Dendera, also known as “The Zodiac of Osiris” ([1062]). It is a ceiling relief
carved in stone, qv in fig. 12.8.
The Napoleonic album contains a drawn copy of this zodiac, and also a shaded drawing (see
[1100], A. Vol. IV; Pl. 21). All the symbols on the zodiac have been copied, including small details.
The artists endeavoured to attain photographic precision, and they almost succeeded. Comparing
a drawn copy of the Round Zodiac of Dendera to the photographs of the original made in the
Louvre in the year 2000 demonstrate the drawn copy to be all but free of errors. The existing
minute discrepancies only concern some details pertaining to mutual planetary disposition or
certain finer points of writing hieroglyphs. There aren’t many of these, although some of them
proved to be important.
In general, our comparison demonstrates that one can trust the illustrations from the Napoleonic
album – insofar as the rectangular zodiacs are concerned, that is, since in their case the details of
mutual figure disposition are insignificant for the purposes of deciphering the zodiacs, seeing as
how all the figures are presented in a row. As for the round zodiacs, there is only one such item in
the Napoleonic despription; namely, the Round Zodiac of Dendera. Fortunately, we have modern
photographs of this zodiac, and they answer all the questions that may arise in this respect.
The Round Zodiac of Dendera has survived in its entirety. There had been no losses, chips,
chiselled-off figures etc when the drawn copy was made. According to modern photograph, the
zodiac remains in excellent condition.
2) The Long or Rectangular Zodiac of Dendera is a ceiling relief carved in stone. It is a zodiac of the
rectangular type, which means that all of its outlines are rectangular, and the figures are lined up
in rows.



There is a shaded copy and a drawn copy of the Long Zodiac likewise the Round (see [1100], A.
Vol. IV, Pl. 20). In [1100] one also sees a drawing of the entire ceiling where the Long Zodiac was
found. The actual Long Zodiac is part of a large ceiling decoration ([1100], A. Vol. IV, Pl. 18).
We have already pointed out the fact that copying rectangular zodiacs is an endeavour that has
less strict precision criteria than making copies of round zodiacs. The artist copying a round
zodiacs is higly likely to make a mistake in the distribution of figures across the entire field, even if
this artist has knowledge of astronomy due to incomplete understanding of the Egyptian figures’
astronomical meaning and ignorance of finer details concerning their mutual disposition. A slight
shift in the position of a figure as related to that of other figures surrounding it might result in the
loss of an important detail of the astronomical description. Below we shall cite some such
examples. In the rectangular zodiacs, a slight shift of a figure’s position in relation to other figures
does not affect the astronomical meaning of the picture. Furthermore, each of the figures only
has two neighbours, and so the mutual disposition of figures is easier to copy.
Thus, the quality of the Long Zodiac’s copies in the Napoleonic album ([1100])is high enough for
the purposes of analysing and dating the zodiac in question. We shall reproduce these copies
below. The Long Zodiac of Dendera also survived in its entirety. There are no traces of damage on
the copies from the Napoleonic edition.
3) The zodiac from the Greater Temple of Esna. A ceiling relief carved in stone. [1100] contains a
shaded copy and a drawn copy of the zodiac, qv in [1100], A. Vol. IV, Pl. 79.
The zodiac from the Greater Temple of Esna is of the rectangular type; therefore, everything that
has been said about the Long Zodiac of Dendera above applies to this zodiac as well.
According to the drawing in the Napoleonic edition ([1100]), the zodiac had been in a very good
condition when it was copies, with no missing details. The copy in [1100] is a detailed and an
accurate one. However, the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the plaques weren’t copied – or had
possibly already been lost by the time the copy was made.
4) The zodiac from the Lesser Temple of Esna. A ceiling relief carved in stone. [1100] also contains
a drawn and a shaded copy of the zodiac. A part of the zodiac had been chiselled off, which is how
it was drawn by Napoleon’s artists. The remaining part is in good condition.
5) The zodiac from the ceiling of the sepulchre in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor. In the
Napoleonic description as given in [1100], the sepulchre is called “1er tombeau des Rois à
l’Ouest”. [1100] also contains a detaild copy of the zodiac in colour, qv in fig. 12.3. The zodiac is of
the rectangular type without too many small details. The drawing from [1100] suffices for the
purpose of analysing the zodiac and dating it astronomically.



6) Modern drawn copies of the Round Zodiac of Dendera and its fragments made from the
original of the zodiac kept in the Louvre ([1062]).
7) 30 photographs of the Round Zodiac of Dendera that Professor Y. V. Tatarinov (MSU) had made
for us in the Louvre in the year 2000 ([1062]).
8) Photographed fragments of the Round Zodiac of Dendera from the Art and History of Egypt by
Alberto Carlo Carpiceci ([370], page 165).
9) Photographed fragment of the Round Zodiac of Dendera from the Life and Death of the
Pharaoh Tutankhamen by Christiane Desroches-Noblecourt ([1101], page 255).
10) A drawn copy of the zodiac discovered by H. Brugsch on an “ancient” Egyptian coffin.
Published by H. Brugsch in 1862 ([1054]). Brugsch’s drawn copy is reproduced by N. A. Morozov in
[544], Volume 5, page 696.
11) A drawn copy of the horoscopes of Athribis discovered by Flinders Petrie on the ceiling of an
Egyptian burial cave in 1901 which he published in the 14th volume of the British School of
Archaelogy in Egypt, which is whence N. A. Morozov borrowed it ([544], Volume 6, pages 728 and
739. See also [1340:1].
12) Zodiacs from the ceilings of the Egyptian sepulchres of Petosiris and Petubastis. Black and
white photographs and colour photographs of some fragments taken from the publication by
Neugebauer, Parker and Pingrie ([1291]).
13) A copy of the Long Zodiac of Dendera published by Baudet and reproduced by N. A. Morozov
in ([544], Volume 6, inset after page 672).



10. Some Strange Features of Ptolemy's Almagest. Preliminary Remarks
10.1. Latin and Greek editions
In conclusion, several remarks regarding the Almagest are in order. It is assumed that its first printed edition was published in 1515 in Latin (Greek being regarded as the language of the original). It was an awkward translation of the Arabic manuscripts. The edition of 1528 was based on the first, and subject to criticism. The first printed edition of the Greek text had been made in Basel in 1538, only five years before Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium appeared. A translation from the Arabic text of the year 827 was allegedly made in 1230 A.D. (whereas, according to H. Montignot, this was done in the 11th c.). J. Bode in his work on the Almagest asserted that it had been incorrect, judging from the comparison of the Latin text with the Arabic one ([13], V. 5, p. 194). We have no information regarding the translation and the edition of 1528 A.D. In 1537, the Latin text was also published in Cologne. We could not find enough data concerning the history and fate of the earlier translations, except the Cologne edition of 1537 and the one from Basel of 1538 (a very remarkable fact), and also about how much and how precisely they differ from the widely accepted text of the Almagest, which we will discuss below (following N. A. Morozov), and which was based on the Cologne and Basel books. Controversy surrounds even the earlier Venetian edition, for which N. I. Idelson supplies 1528, whereas N. A. Morozov, referring to J. Bode, gives 1537 (ibid.). Therefore, we have concentrated our attention on the first Greek Basel edition and the Latin 1537 Cologne edition, on whose title page it printed in black and white that it is the first (!), due to which we should clarify how reliable the dating of the 1528 edition is.
Following the two editions of 1537 and 1538, others appeared in 1541, 1551, etc. [13], [122]. Their abundance shows that the Almagest edition was not regarded as outdated in the 16th c. in spite of its antiquity (as suggested today).
According to 0. Neugebauer, there is no better way to convince oneself of the intrinsic consistency of ancient and medieval astronomy than to juxtapose the Almagest and Copernicus' De revolutionibus. Chapter after chapter, theorem after theorem, table after table, these works run parallel ([257+], p. 197).
One of the most important sections of the Almagest is a star catalogue said in the text to have been made under Antoninus Pius from the personal observations of the author. Its surprisingly good condition attracts our attention first of all; the repeated copying during more than one thousand years as suggested by traditional history did not impair it at all. Any editor knows how many errors even a very attentive copyist of large numerical material can make. The second particular is its exceptional precision; the star coordinates are given to the accuracy of 1/6 of



304 Enquete-Codes
a degree. As a matter of fact, a precise timepiece is required for measuring the coordinates of heavenly bodies, and mere instruments for measuring angles are not enough. In order to obtain coordinates to the accuracy indicated by Ptolemy, a timepiece with a minute hand is required as a minimum! Meanwhile, while accurately describing the tools used, e.g., an armillary sphere, Ptolemy said nothing of a clock. The hypothesis regarding the existence of a timepiece with a minute hand in the 2nd c. A.D. contradicts the traditional information about the clock technology of that time [123]. Recall that a clock with a minute hand appeared in Europe 1 only in the 15th c. A.D., and immediately uranometry, the art of determining star coordinates, started blooming. The third interesting feature is that, according to the modern astronomers, Ptolemy counted the longitudes of the point of the spring equinox where the ecliptic and equator meet; it is in Pisces, and there are no bright stars nearby. First, this point is imaginary and unrelated to any star; therefore, its visual observation is impossible, since it can only be calculated. But its computation cannot be done without a timepiece reckoning parts of a minute. The Almagest was analyzed in [13], V. 5. In particular, we made use of this investigation. It turns out that there exists a reliable technique to restore the time when it was made from the catalogue itself. Since star ecliptical coordinates (longitudes and latitudes)
are indicated in the catalogue, and the longitudes increase annually by 5011 2 due to precession, dividing by this value the difference between the modern longitudes and those listed by Ptolemy, we at once obtain the year when the catalogue was made. This elementary computation leads to a shocking result: All the longitudes of the stars listed in the first Latin edition of the Almagest were observed in the 16th c. A.D., when the book was published! Why did J. Bode, who subjected the Almagest to accurate analysis, not notice it? [122]. It turns out that he studied the second, Greek edition, allegedly the original, from which the "Latin translation" is said to be made. J. Bode's position is clear: Why analyze the "Latin translation" when the undoubtedly authentic Greek text is available? But the longitudes in the Greek edition of all the stars were decreased by 20° ± 10', compared with the Latin edition, which dates the position of the stars to the 2nd c. A.D. This may arouse suspicion that the Latin text was the original, and the Greek secondary, and not vice versa as regarded by tradition. It is possible that the 16th-c. author who was first to publish the "translation" did not care about taking precession into account. Being apprised of that, he introduced this correction and others into the Greek "original", moving it into the 2nd c. A.D. Furthermore, a point of view was widespread in the 16th c. A.D. that the value of precession was 51" a year. The division by this value of the difference between the longitudes of the Greek and the Latin edition leads to 139 A.D. (i.e., precisely the second year of Antoninus Pius' reign according to traditional chronology!) as indicated in the book. It is probable that the year when the book was written, compared in this way, was indicated in the text by the 16th-c. authors' hoping to hide the true time of observations. But the true value of precession was different! If we divide the difference between the longitudes by this more precise value (due to J. Lalande and J. Bode), then we obtain that the catalogue was made in 63 A.D. under Nero, and not under Antoninus Pius. This circumstance embarrassed the astronomers; it was suggested that Ptolemy had made use of some earlier observations (and not his own), though the Almagest clearly indicated that



Some Strange Features of Ptolemy's Almagest 305
they had been made by the author personally. The problem of dating the Almagest was discussed in many works; in particular, it was conjectured that the "earlier" observations had been made by Hipparchus. Many astronomers did not agree with this ([257+], pp. 80-81). Though, an objection to the primacy of the Latin text is possible. In the 16th c., Ptolemy's book was published not as a document of the history of science, but as a treatise for immediate use by scientists and students of astronomy. The catalogue could not be used, made obsolete due to precession, and the translator updated it, introducing the latest data. As to the Greek edition, he believed it unnecessary as a textbook, because the Latin translation was available, and, hence, restored Ptolemy's original figures (which relate the catalogue to the beginning of the first millenium). This argument is also supported by the title page of the Latin edition, with direct indication that the book was reduced to "the modern epoch" and especially designed for students; thus acknowledging that the Latin edition (at least with respect to the catalogue) was apocryphal, but denying this concerning the Greek edition. The objection can be refuted by the fact that the coordinates of many of the most remarkable stars listed in the Greek edition were considerably improved in comparison with the Latin edition (see their list in [13], V. 4). Besides, the Greek edition of 1538 literally teems with improvements of this sort in contrast to the Latin one signed by 1537 A.D. But that was not all. Comparison of the star latitudes in the Latin "translation" and the Greek "original" shows that they all were increased by 25" or corrected to more precise ones, and not due to precession, for the latitudes are not subject to it. The corrections were always such that the whole ecliptic was shifted southwards, almost onto the sun's diameter, which seems to be, possibly, only due to the author's introduction of systematic corrections to refraction, without taking into account that they, just equal to the sun's diameter, decreased in shifting towards the pole of the ecliptic (a vertically falling ray is not refracted). The author could not calculate the differential corrections of today, and confined himself to systematically shifting all the stars except those investigated in an especially precise way. Thus, "restoring" Ptolemy's data in one respect (cf. precession), the Greek edition improved them (or attempted to improve) in another, which does not agree with the conjecture regarding the text' originality. Studying the latitudes, J. Bode noticed that the Almagest's entire ecliptic had been askew (which was, in fact, true), indicating that its deviation is one and a half times greater than in theory, and expressed his bewilderment as to what such a considerable systematic difference can be ascribed. There is an explanation: The catalogue's author resorted to so-called ecliptical, and not equatorial coordinates (as expected), which are substantially more precise and more easily determined from observations. If we assume that he originally determined the star positions in the equatorial system and subsequently recalculated them into the ecliptical, then the deviation can be immediately explained by the rounding-off errors. It suffices to put the distance on the sphere of the pole of the ecliptic precisely equal to 23° instead of 23.5° in order to obtain the systematic difference that so surprised J. Bode. The generally accepted method of rounding off was rejecting any fractional parts, even close to unity, and in our case it is only 0.5. However, if the author simply knew of oscillations in the ecliptic with respect to



306 Enquete-Codes
latitudes, then it immediately signifies that the book was written not earlier than the 16th c. A.D. Why then did he not retain the original equatorial coordinate system (as is done in all modern catalogues), carrying out the enormous job of recalculating the coordinates into ecliptical ones? Note that the methods of such a recomputation are quite bulky and lead to new errors. The whole job is so superfluous that you want to find some reason for it, probably mere (and vain) ambition to make the catalogue eternal, and thereby hide the apocrypha. As a matter of fact, ecliptical latitudes are not subject to precession!
The original equatorial coordinate system can also be discerned in the order of catalogizing the stars. Like the modern astronomers, Ptolemy started his catalogue with the North Star (a of Ursa Minor), i.e., the pole of the equatorial system. If the author had made the catalogue with respect to the ecliptical system from scratch, then it would have been natural to begin with the pole in the constellation Draco, and catalogue its stars first. Actually, the stars of Ursa Minor were catalogued in the Almagest, then those of Ursa Major and Draco. Moreover, starting the catalogue with the North star, the author created another anachronism, it being closest to the
pole of the world only in modern times (!), /3, the opposite star in that same Ursa Minor, nearest to the pole in the 2nd c. A.D. The author again disclosed the time when the catalogue was made.
The book ended no less remarkably, indicating Achernar (more precisely, "a very bright star in Eridanus"), which could not have been observed in Alexandria in the 2nd c. A.D., since it was at an angle of 10° below the horizon; to watch it, you had to move 600 km deep into Africa. In the 16th c. A.D., due to precession, it had already risen over the horizon and was observable in Egypt. Certainly, its low position created difficulties for the observer, and the coordinates in the Latin 1537 edition were given with an error. Hence, modern commentators of the Almagest prefer to believe that Ptolemy exaggerated the brightness of this "very bright star" in Eridanus, and that it is not identifiable with Achernar but with O of Eridanus located north of Achernar.
10.2. Diirer's astrographic charts in the first editions of the Ahnagest
As indicated on the title page, the edition was supplied with 48 astrographic charts engraved by A. Diirer. Until book printing came into use, astrographic charts had listed only the brightest stars, and their disposition across the constellations varied from chart to chart. It was only after gravure had been invented that publishing a detailed astrographic chart for the study by astronomers became possible. Until the invention in the 15th c. A.D. of a process for reproducing pictures mechanically (gravure), no detailed astrographic charts could have been spoken of, and only mass editions of absolutely identical copies could have justified the sky's detailed representation with stars of the third and fourth magnitude. Even if somebody had undertaken the titanic work of making such a chart, it could not have been completely preserved for centuries, because its copies would at least have decayed soon, and reproduction meant repeating the whole job anew. A. Diirer's astrographic charts were the first authentic detailed sky maps. Neither an astronomer nor an observer, with the only purpose of retaining the elegance, he made certain essential



Some Strange Features of Ptolemy's Almagest 307
inaccuracies. We illustrate this only with the shiniest examples. The constellation Ara looks very beautiful in A. Diirer's map; however, we see that Ara is turned upside down in the sky, and its tongue is lowered instead of being raised, the torch burning upside down. "Who of the authentic ancient stargazers imagined it in this form?" ([13], V. 4, p. 209). Winged Pegasus is also very beautiful according to A. Diirer and is correct, i.e., not upturned in the plane representation. Nevertheless, if we take the map and look into real sky, then " from sunset to sunrise, Pegasus flies there with its legs upwards like a shot-down bird" (ibid.). It is also clear that the ancient astronomers would have never represented this "winged" constellation as flying upside-down. It was, therefore, A. Diirer's blunder. Accordingly, Hercules is with its legs upwards if we apply the chart to the actual sky. Virgo is also represented erroneously, supine and setting with her legs upwards. Meanwhile, in pre-Diirer's and quite rough charts, it had normally been represented (standing), though with fantastic arrangement of other stars. It is important that all the inaccuracies vanish in the plane chart (Pegasus is standing up, etc.), i.e., the arrangement was chosen because of artistic requirements. A. Diirer's errors were natural: Having a plane chart, and not a real picture, he was drawing in order to make an impression on the art lover. Certainly, engraving was an enormous job; therefore, even if all these blunders did awe the author-astronomer, he could do no more than launch all the drawings into publication, especially since A. Diirer, who regarded them only as works of art, could bring the prints (made not later than 1515 A.D.) into circulation without waiting for the book to be published. A. Diirer's "Pegasus turned upside-down", e.g., clearly put Copernicus in trouble. Retaining its senseless position, he changed the order of the stars in his own star catalogue, thus showing the covert struggle of common sense against the nonsense of certain fragments of A. Diirer's charts consecrated by Ptolemy's authority. Acknowledging the authorship of A. Diirer in all the blunders in the constellations' positions, we establish that any representation copying his errors must be post-Diirer. We now return to Ptolemy. The Almagest positions the non-bright zodiacal stars not on the basis of their coordinates, but on verbal descriptions of the type: "in Aries' horn", "in Pegasus' mouth", "in the ankle of Pegasus' right leg", etc. It follows clearly that they refer to the charts, i.e., A. Diirer's pictures! Therefore, they could have all appeared in the Almagest only after 1515 A.D. Thus, not only the star catalogue, but the very text of the Almagest was created in its final form only in the 16th c. A.D., immediately before being printed. The Almagest also touched other problems of astronomy (the theory of planets, eclipses, etc.), with the corresponding chapters not containing any proof of textual antiquity. Quite the opposite, the unusual fragmentariness of Ptolemy's reports of lunar eclipses, and their great scattering across centuries, catches one's eye. For example, of 41 eclipses which could be seen in the Mediterranean in the 2nd c. A.D., Ptolemy indicated four, with only one of them being total, and the other three partial. And this was done by a professional astronomer stressing that he had carried



308 Enquete-Cocles
out the observations personally ([13], V. 4, p. 467). The textual study discloses the reason for this strange phenomenon. Describing the technical characteristics of the four eclipses (the time of their maximal phases and the phases themselves, etc.), he hinted that he had precisely calculated all of them (ibid.). Tht astronomer F. Ginzel, while taking note of this declaration by Ptolemy, did not feel doubtful about the computations having been made in the 2nd c. A.D., before the eclipses. After everything we know about the Almagest, we may ask: Is it true that the computations were made in the 2nd c. A.D.? As to the "personal observations" concerning eclipses, they are as reliable as the statement about the "personal observation" of the stars. That lunar eclipses are apocryphal and calculable can also account for Ptolemy's not mentioning a word about the immeasurably more impressive solar eclipses, e.g., the annular solar eclipse in 125 A.D., whose maximal phase was seen in Alexandria at 10 a.m., occurring only a fortnight before the lunar eclipse described by him. Ptolemy disregarded this solar eclipse. From our point of view, the author of the Almagest simply was not aware of any solar eclipse of the time and could not determine their characteristics, since, even in the 15-16th cc. A.D., to determine the umbra of a solar eclipse was an extremely complicated problem, in contrast with lunar ones whose predictions and computations could be carried out successfully. The identification of others of Ptolemy's eclipses, carried out by F. Ginzel, is based on solutions strained to a small, but quite definite, degree, which completely rejects the traditional dating of this part of the Almagest [13]. It should be borne in mind that calculating astronomical data "in the past" could have been carried out in the Middle Ages also as "computation exercises". The same might be attributed to attempts to make such calculated astronomical dates agree with hypothetically ancient calendars, eras, etc.
11. Duplicates in Greek Chronology. The 1,800-year Chronological Shift
11.1. The Epoch of the Crusades in 1099-1230 A.D. and the Epoch of the Great Greek Colonization in the 8-6th cc. B.C.
Here, we will analyze the basic duplicates arising under the shift by c. 1,810 years. Apparently, medieval Greece in the 10-15th cc. A.D. was an arena of the basic events now referred to in the history of classical ancient Greece. As I discovered, the global history of Europe and the Mediterranean probably possesses numerous identifications represented in the GCD. The "modern textbook" is the result of gluing the four practically identical chronicles together, which are shifted with respect to their original (first chronicle) backwards by c. 333 (Byzantine-Roman shift), 1,053 (Roman shift), 1,778 or 1,810 (Greco-biblical shift) years, respectively. The shift by c. 720 years, being the difference of the first and second, is also important. The names stress the history of civilization in which they are especially important. In the table below, we briefly indicate which events of medieval history in the 10-15th cc. A.D. served as the originals of those described by Herodotus in his Histories, and then referred to profound antiquity.



Duplicates in Greek Chronology 309
We first list the four historical epochs which are, probably, duplicates. Note that, as it turns out, not only medieval Greek, but also Italian events in the 10-15th cc. A.D. were reflected in Herodotus' Histories. See Figs. 64 (1), 64 (2), 101, 104, Table 17.
(1) The Holy Roman Empire in the 10-13th cc. A.D. War in Italy in the 13th c. A.D. and the fall of medieval Troy (= TRN). We denote this war by the GTR-war.
(2) Livy's regal Rome of seven kings, war of the Tarquins, the TRQN-clan.
(3) Ancient Greece in the 8-5th cc. B.C. Expulsion of the tyrants(= TRN). Epoch of the great Greek colonization in the 8-6th cc. B.C.
(4) The crusades and colonization of the East in the 10-13th cc. A.D.
Roman history
la. According to GCD, period 901924 A.D. of Italian history is occupied by copy of GTR-war and duplicate of Trojan war
Greek history
lb. Herodotus started his Histories with short account of legends of Trojan war and its incentives ([67], 1:1-5)
In reality, while describing the initial period of the history of ancient Greece, Herodotus reproduced fragments of Roman history described by Livy, but under different names.
2a. In Livy's version of war with Tarquins, dispute broke out about whose wife was better, leading to rape of Lucretia, her death and war [174]. According to Homer, it was "judgement of Paris", dispute among goddesses, "apple of discord"
3a. "Woman's offence" (Lucretia, Helen, Amalasuntha, etc.) and revenge for it. GTR-war occurred in Italy(= TL)
4a. In Livy's, Gothic and version of 13th c. A.D., GTR-war led to changing ruling dynasty. Dynasty of Hohenstaufen fell in 13th c. A.D. (cf. Hugo in 10th c. A.D.)
2b. In Herodotus' version, tyrant (= TRN again!) Candaules of Sardis "argued" with Gyges around 560 B.C., asserting that his wife was most beautiful woman in world. Events ended in Candaules' death ([67], 1:7-10)
3b. Offence of Candaules' wife and revenge for it. Events occurred in Lydia (= LD). Terms "LD" and "TL'' are different only in order of their letters 4b. In Herodotus' version, these events also led to dynastic changes, and Heraclidae fell ([67], 1:7). One of principal personages was Gyges (cf. Hugo in left column)
5a. HolyRomanEmpirein962-1250A.D. 5b. According to Herodotus, six kings It is also Livy's regal Rome of seven are placed in this period under 1,810kings (cf. six kings in right columns) year shift. Herodotus supplied very little information about them (ibid.)

6a. Epoch of Crusades in 1099- 6b. 1230 A.D. Famous epoch in history
Epoch ofgreat Greek colonization in 8-6th cc .B.C. started in 10th c. A.D. (under above shift) just when socalled classical Greece began [110]. In Greek polises, power also belonged to the basileuses in 7-6th cc. B.C. ([110], p. 46, 55). Greek "written history" started in 8th c. B.C.
of Europe and East. Colonization of East, forming new states. Medieval Greece ruled by Byzantine Empire with basileuses. According to GCD, "written history" more or less started just in 10th c. A.D.
7a. Hohenstaufen were especially important in medieval Rome in 11381254 A.D. They were earlier identified with Gothic dynasty, Tarquins, Trojans and TRQN-clan
7b. Under upward 1,800-year shift, we move into 7-8th cc. A.D. TRKVN (or TRN) was very important in Greek 6-7th-c. history. This epoch
was called "epoch of tyrants (=
TRN)"
In the Middle Ages, the south of Italy was called Great Greece [44].
Sa. According to Livy, last TRQN-king Tarquin the Proud ruled in Rome in 534-509 B.C. End of his reign coincides with date on right
9a. Tarquin the Proud ruled for 26 years. Terms "PRS" and "TRN" are always present in GTR-war; combined, they form "PRSTRN"
10a. Tarquin the Proud took power in Rome and established TRQN-clan's power [174]
11a. Tarquin's banishment from Rome, uprise against him, led by two heroes, Brutus and Valerius (ibid.). Tarquin attempted to return to power with no success. War ended in complete defeat ofTarquins c. 509 B.C., i.e., around 1300 A.D. (under 1,800-year upward shift)
Sb. Peisistratus' tyranny ruled in Athens in 560-510 B.C. [283]. Herodotus and Livy probably described same history
9b. Peisistratus reigned for 33 years in 560-527 B.C., his name possibly being close to "PRSTRN" (cf. left column)
10b. Peisistratus took power in 560 B.C.
and established tyranny (= TRN) in Athens ([283], p. 146)
11b. Peisistratus' banishment from Athens, uprise against him, led by two heroes, Megacles and Lycurgus Peisistratus, several times marched to Athens, and could twice return to power. However, war with tyrants in 514-510 B.C. ended in their defeat and death ([283], pp. 146-147)
12a. Fall of TRQN was turning-point in 12b. Fall of tyrants was turning-point in Roman history Greek history (ibid.)



Duplicates in Greek Chronology
13a. End of dynasty of Hohenstaufen. Power went to House of Anjou. Kaiser Manfred was last in dynasty {1254-1266A.D.) [44), [45). Reigned for 12 years in Italy(= TL, or LT, "Latins")
311
13b. End of Heraclidae. Power went to Croesus ([67], 1:6), hero {probably, identical to "kaiser"). Ruled for 14
years in 560-546 B.C. in Lydia (= LD, or LT) ([39], p. 193)
14a. Totila's reign in 541-552 A.D. (= 14b. Croesus, son of Alyattes (= LTT TTL), Manfred's duplicate in Third = TTL if read backwards; cf. left Empire column)
11.2. Charles of Anjou and Cyrus
Medieval Greece
15a. Charles of Anjou, Manfred's enemy. War between them. Charles of Anjou was French (= PRS), and became Achaean ruler (!) in 12781285 A.D. [45]. Stormed on Conradin in 1268 A.D., and conquered Italy(= LT, or Latinia). Italy was under PRS-power. Manfred ruled in 1254-1266 A.D. Everything well consistent with right column
15*a. Charles of Anjou actually founded Neapolitan kingdom, succeeded by Charles II of Naples (ibid.)
16a. Charles of Anjou actually reigned for 29 years in 1254 (last year in reign of Conrad IV) - 1285 A.D. (ibid.)
17a. Long siege of Troy = Naples = Rome in GTR-war. Army commander Belisarius, Charles' duplicate
Ancient Greece
15b. Cyrus was Croesus' enemy. War between them. Cyrus was king of Persia (= PRS). Having conquered Lydia (LD, or LT), he also took Greek territories in Asia Minor ([283), p. 168) in 546 B.C., or 1264 A.D. under above shift (cf. 1268 A.D. in left column). Cyrus = sire (king?). Lydia was taken by PRS. Croesus ruled in 560546 B.C. [39), or 1250-1264 A.D. under above shift
15*b. Cyrus and his son Cambyses are
regarded as founders of Persian (= PRS) state ([110], p. 87), latter being superimposed on Charles II of Naples (see below)
16b. Cyrus reigned for 29 years in 559530 B.C. ([39), p. 193), or 12511280 A.D. under 1,810-year shift, which is well consistent with left column
17b. Long siege of Babylon by Cyrus ([67], 1:190). Babylon is superimposed on Rome (see, e.g., [13])



312
18a. Belisarius' military trick when taking Naples, and penetrating into city through dried-up aqueduct, analogue of "Trojan horse". GTR-war
ended in 1268 A.D. (Fall of Troy = Naples, death of Conradin) [44]
Enquete-Codes
18b. Cyrus' military trick when he penetrated into Babylon along dried-up river's bed. Details are similar to those of taking Naples and Troy [44]. Fall of Babylon is dated to 539 B.C., or 1271 A.D. (!) under 1,810-year upward shift
According to traditional history, the name "Cyrus" was revived in medieval Greece just in the 13th c. A.D. The quite modest title "sire" was distorted by the Greeks into "Cyrus" , and grew in their eyes into the magnificent megaskyr (great ruler) [45]. I have made the following simple calculation. F. Gregorovius' text embraces the lst-17th cc. A.D., describing decade after decade in the history of Greece. I marked all the years in which the term "Cyrus" was mentioned.
19a. Sharp increase of mentions of "Cyrus" in 13th c. A.D. No mentions beyond 13th c. A.D. [45]
20a. GTR-war of 13th c. A.D. is probably original of Trojan war (see above), and dated to 1250-1268' A.D. or 1204 A.D. (Constantinople)
21a. Successor to Charles of Anjou, Charles of Naples reigned for four years in 1285-1289 A.D. (ibid.), which is well consistent with right column
19b. Sharp increase of mentions of king Cyrus in Greece in 6th c. B.C. These two splashes are well consistent under 1,810-year shift 20b. Muntaner's version describing Trojan war as medieval event is given in [45] when accounting for events which occurred in 1270 A.D.
21b. Cambyses, Cyrus' son and successor, reigned for 8 years in 530522 B.C. ([39], p. 193), end of his rule occurred 1288 A.D. under 1,810-year upward shift
The name "Cambyses" is, probably, formed from CAM and BIS, the latter translating from the Latin as "second". Since the "Persians" were repeatedly identified with the "French", such a translation is appropriate. Thus, Charles II is superimposed on CM II.
22a. Frederick II Sicilian reigned for about 35 years in 1302-1337 A.D.
[45]. His name = FR + DERICK, another version being Frederici (Faderici)
22b. Cambyses' successor, Darius I Hystaspes reigned for 36 years in 522486 B.C. [74], [283]. Official coin was daric (Gr. Dareik). Terms "daric" and "Darius" are possibly close (cf. also Frederici)
23a. Frederick's actual co-ruler was Mar- 23b. Well-known Mardonius was actugaret, mistress of Morea woman of Morea
ally co-ruling with Darius, "actual ruler of Persia" ([110, p. 92)
It is probable that Margaret Donna turned into "Mardonius" in certain documents.



Duplicates in Greek Chronology 313
24a. Series of wars on medieval Greek 24b. Greco-Persian wars started in 492 soil started in 1314 A.D. [45] B.C. ([110], p.92)
The dates are very consistent under the 1,810-year shift, viz., 1810- 1314 = 496, whereas we have 492 B.C. in the right column, with the divergence being only 4 years (under the 1,810-year shift!).
25a. Margaret (= MR - Donna) was principal inspirer of war, its first period ending unsuccessfully for her ([45*], p. 222)
25b. Mardonius was principal inspirer and organizer of war, first Persian expedition ending unsuccessfully ([110], p. 92; [283], p. 179)
26a. Second period. Military expedition 26b. Second Persian expedition to Greece to Morea in 1315 A.D. (ibid.) in 490 B.C. (ibid.)
Under the 1,810-year shift, 1315 A.D. is made coincident with 495 B.C., which is well consistent with 490 B.C. on the right.
27a. Ferdinand, army commander under Frederick II, his representative and Margaret's(= MR+ Donna) sonin-law, who headed army which invaded Greece
28a. Battle of 1316 A.D. was central event of this period in Morea [45]
29a. Participation of Venetian fleet in war of 1316 A.D. is especially stressed (ibid.). Venice supported French (= PRS) in this war
11.3. Matilda and Miltiades
Medieval Greece
30a. Morea's troops were headed by woman made famous in this period, Matilda, together with her husband, Frenchman Louis of Burgundy ([45*], pp. 222-223)
27b. Arthaphernes, army commander under Mardonius and Darius I, headed Persian army with Oatis ([283], p. 180). It is possible that Arthaphernes is distorted version of "Ferdinand"
28b. Battle of Marathon of Persians with Greeks in 490 B.C. ([110], p. 93). Under 1,810-year shift, we obtain 1320 A.D. (cf. agreement of dates in right column)
29b. Participation of Phoenician fleet in war of 490 B.C. is especially stressed ([110], p. 92). Phoenicia supported Persia in its war with Greece. Phoenicia = Venice?
Ancient Greece
30b. "The Greek troops were headed by the talented army commander Miltiades, who lived in Persia for a long time ..." (ibid.), his name being evidently close to "Matilda"



314 Enquete-Codes
The same confusion can be observed here as above. The women "MR + Donna" and Matilda turned into the men Mardonius and Miltiades (or vice versa).
31a. Matilda then became Ferdinand's (Persians') analogue. Adversary
Ferdinand (= PRS) landed with his fleet in Greece in 1315 and 1316 A.D., coming out against Matilda and Louis [45). (Cf. consistency of dates under shift.)
31b. Miltiades then became Persians' adversary in war. Persians headed by Arthaphernes (and Datis) landed with their fleet in Greece in 492 and 490 B.C., coming out against Miltiades ([110), pp. 92-93)
Under the 1,810-year shift, we have 1,810 - 492 = 1318, which is close to 1315,
and 1810 - 490 = 1320, which is close to 1316.
32a. Ferdinand's army was defeated in 1316 A.D. War was won by Matilda, regent of principality. Her further tragic fate: She was tried in 1322 A.D. ([45*), p. 224)
32b. Persians led by Arthaphernes (and Datis) were defeated, and war won by Miltiades, who was principal hero of this period. His further tragic fate: He was tried in 489 B.C. ([110), p. 93)
Under the 1,810-year shift, we obtain the ideal consistency of these two well-known
dates in Greek history, which clearly duplicate each other; thus: 1810-1322 = 488 B.C.
33a. Matilda was removed from power, and tried by pope in Avignon in 1322 A.D. However, she was not executed, but taken to fortress where she died in 1331 A.D. [45)
34a. Duke Walter II reigned for 19 years from 1337 (when Frederick II of Sicily died) until 1356 A.D. (ibid.)
33b. Miltiades was dismissed, and his enemies demanded his execution. However, he was pardoned, and execution replaced by payment of enormous fine. Soon after trial, Miltiades died in 489 B.C. ([283), p. 184)
34b. Xerxes the Great reigned for 22 (or 21) years in 486-464 B.C. [39), [74) (cf. consistency with Duke Walter II)
Under the 1,810-year shift, we obtain that Walter's rule was superimposed on 473-454 B.C., which is close to Xerxes' rule.
35a. Franks' third expedition to Greece in 1331 A.D., lasting for about one year [45)
35b. Persians' third expedition to Greece in 480 B.C., lasting for about one year ([110), p. 94; [283), p. 184)
The Franks (= TRN and = PRS) are mentioned in the left column, whereas the



Duplicates in Greek Chronology 315
Persians (= PRS) are shown in the right one. Under the 1,810-year shift, we obtain
that the dates are ideally consistent, viz., 1810 - 1331 = 479 B.C. (whereas we have 480 B.C. on the right!).
36a. Duke Walter II was French and belonged to best families in France and Italy [45]. Simultaneous inva
sion of Franks (= PRS = TRNK)
and Turks (= TRK) of Greece, one of most important events in medieval Greece. Chronicles stress long process of preparation, and pope John XXII declared expedition as Crusade [45]
37a. Duke Walter was accompanied by his wife Margaret, second most
important heroine (MR + Donna again). In 1331 A.D., Duke Walter went on military expedition, sending his troops to Greece by sea. War lasted for about 1 year, and failed, whereupon Walter left Greece, and invasion failed, too [45]
36b. Xerxes was Persian (= PRS) and greatest figure of this period, one of most popular ancient heroes [67]. Persians' third expedition to Greece is regarded as greatest and most dangerous. It was prepared scrupulously and for long time ([283], pp. 184-185). Herodotus described grandiose military preparations preceded by strong diplomatic activity [67]
37b. "... Mardonius, Xerxes' closest military consultant ...", again took part in military expedition as second principal hero of war ([67], [283], p. 185). In 480 B.C., Xerxes undertook military expedition to Greece via Hellespont, which lasted for about 1 year, and finished with Xerxes' defeat ([67], [283], pp. 185195)
38a. Greeks and Catalonians could not 38b. provide for strong defence in Greece during first period of this war.
Greeks could not form strong army in first period of this war, and Xerxes easily conquered part of Greece. Persians then lost. Both of Xerxes' brothers died during war ([67*], p. 373). Parallel between these events is clearly seen
At first, they evaded action, then turning-point, and French lost. Duke Walter's brother died during war (ibid.)
11.4. The Greco-Persian war and the battle of 300 Spartans with Xerxes' armies at Thermopylae
A famous episode in the history of the Greco-Persian wars is the battle of 300 Spartans with Xerxes' armies at Thermopylae. Under the 1,810-year shift, I could not find the "original" of this event. But under the shift of a slightly smaller value, the battle of 300 Spartans was discovered immediately.



316
Medieval Greece
39a. Thermopylae was mentioned in description of Duke Jean La Roche's expedition in 1275 A.D. General Senadenos (Xerxes' analogue) invaded Thessaly with extremely large army supported by fleet. Byzan
tine (=PRS) and Turkish (=TRK) forces attacked Greece 40a. Duke Jean La Roche with 300 wellarmed knights was engaged in battle with enormous army of Turks, Greeks and Cumaeans, defeating them [45]
Enquete-Codes
Ancient Greece
39b. Thermopylae was mentioned in Xerxes' expedition supported by large Persian (= PRS) fleet [67]. Xerxes is probably Senadenos, and Spartan king Leonidas is Duke Jean La Roche. Well-known episode with 300 Spartans followed
40b. Spartan king Leonidas with 300 Spartans was engaged in battle with enormous Persian army ([283], p. 190), numberoftroops coinciding with that of knights in left column. In fierce fighting, Xerxes defeated Spartans, though he paid dearly for his victory [67]
This parallel is strongly confirmed by the following episode. In view of the multitude of enemies, the duke exclaimed in the words of one of the ancients, "Too many men, but too few he-men!" [45]. F. Gregorovius supplied this report of a medieval chronicle with the comment that "these words were taken from Herodotus' Histories, where Xerxes (!-A. F.) had seen at Thermopylae that his
hordes 11"0.AAOl μtv c.:'vtJpw7rOl d €V O>.trot 8t av8p€<;, though the expression could have occurred to the duke simply after he had realized the situation (probably, knowing Herodotus' Histories well!-A. F.)" ([45*], p. 188(18)). The difference between 1275 A.D. and 480 B.C. is 1,755 years, which is close to 1,778 years, or a variant of the shift by c. 1,800 years. Thus, the parallel indicated by F. Gregorovius corresponds exactly to our GCD.
11.5. The war in medieval Greece and the Peloponnesian war in ancient Greece
Medieval Greece
40a. War in medieval Greece lasted for 13 years in 1374-1387 A.D., principal forces opposing each other being Navarrese and Athens [45]
Ancient Greece
40b. Peloponnesian war in ancient Greece. Lasted for 27 years in 431-404 B.C., two principal forces opposing each other being Sparta and Athens ([283], p. 267)
The astronomical dating of Thucydides leads to two solutions, i.e., the 12th and 11th cc. A.D., with the eclipse of 1039 A.D. (second solution) and the beginning the war in 1374 A.D. being 335 years apart, which is the first basic chronological shift in the GCD.



Duplicates in Greek Chronology
41a. War of 14th c. A.D. was preceded by biggest congress in Greece in 1373 A.D., where delegates from all Greek regions gathered [45]
317
41b. Peloponnesian war was preceded by diplomatic preparation for "congress" ofdelegates ofPeloponnesian League in 432 B.C. ([283], p. 279)
Under the 1,810-year shift, we obtain 1810 - 1373 = 437 B.C., which is close to 432 B.C., when the ancient congress was called.
42a. War of 14th c. A.D. started approximately one year after congress, i.e., in 1374 A.D., being caused by Corinthians' behaviour. Peloponnesus attacked Athens. At start of war in 1377-1378 A.D., Navarrese armies invaded Attica and conquered it [45]
42b. Peloponnesian war started approximately one year after congress, i.e., in 431 B.C., being caused by Corinthians' declaration of war. Headed by Spartans, Peloponnesian League attacked Athens, invading Attica at start ([283], pp. 279-280, 283)
43a. War ended with Athens' defeat 43b. War ended with Athens' defeat (ibid.) (ibid.)
44a. Navarrese, originals ofancient Spartans, were characterized as warhungry gang of tough men who organized military state in Elida, and were famous for magnificent war skills. Military Navarrese state and Catalonians' state in Athens were involved 45a. After Athens' defeat, political life of country changed sharply. Nerio, winner and Navarrese leader, popular army commander principal hero in this war, organized coup d'etat in Athenian duchy (ibid.)
46a. Nerio established new political order, tyranny, and was called "tyrant of Athens" (ibid.). Navarrese were most of all noticeable in Greece, and concluded peace treaty with Turks (Persians' analogue in right column) in 1392 A.D.
44b. According to ancient version, Sparta was war state with quite original "militarized" style of life. Sources noted magnificent war skills ofSpartans and excellent organization of their army [283]. War state Sparta and democratic Athens were engaged in war 45b. After Athens' fall, period of reaction leading to sharp changes in political life of country. Popular Spartan army commander Lysander destroyed Athenian state ([283], pp. 342-343, 338)
46b. Lysander introduced "tyranny of thirty" in Athens, this period just being called "tyranny of thirty" (ibid., p. 344). Sparta became principal division ofGreece, and Persian ally in 401 B.C. ([283], pp. 402-403)
Under the 1,810-year shift, we obtain 1810- 401 = 1409 A.D., which is very close to 1392 A.D. when the peace treaty with the Turks was concluded (see the left column).



318
47a. Nerio died in 1394 A.O. [45]
Enquete-Codes
47b. Lysander died c. 395 B.C. ([283], p. 407)
Under the shift, we obtain 1810 - 1394 = 416 B.C. (cf. 395 B.C.).
48a. Famous Parthenon long having vanished from arena of history surfaced again only in 14th c. A.O., when Nerio decorated it richly and it again acquired its prior importance. Athens was declared to belong to Parthenon at end of 14th c. A.O., thus reviving antique custom [45]
48b. According to ancient version, Parthenon was built in 447 B.C. Under 1,810-year shift, we obtain 1810
447 = 1383 A.O. Thus, in fact, we get to end of14th c. A.O., i.e., epoch of Nerio. Athens was Parthenon's property in 5th c. B.C. Under shift, we get into 14th c. A.O.
According to F. Gregorovius, the monstrous idea to turn the whole city into the property of the Parthenon's Latin priests occurred to Nerio. Making the Virgin Mary the proprietress of the most glorious city, the duke hardly remembered that the Virgin (Parthenos) of the same temple on the Acropolis had already (!) been Athens' mistress. The city of Theseus again took to the divine Virgin's defence [45]. It is probable that the Parthenon was, in fact, erected under Nerio in the 14th c. A.O.
49a. Popular philosopher, writer and public Greek and Italian figure, Gemistus Pletho. Name "Gemistus" means "twin" in Latin. Thus, Gemistus Pletho was "second" Plato, or Plato's "twin". Spirit of Greek science, having slept long, awoke just at that time [45]
49b. Popular philosopher, writer and public figure of ancient Greece, Plato (428-347 B.C.), died in 347 B.C., which is close to 360 B.C., year of Pletho's death (1450 A.O. under 1,810-year shift). This period was Golden Age of science and ancient Greek literature (also Socrates, Herodotus and Thucydides)
50a. Mistra's well-known despotate, war 50b. Sparta, well-known war state of state (ibid.) despotic type
F. Gregorovius was unable to ignore the obvious parallels, and noted that Mistra, or Sparta, had been at that time the political and spiritual concentration of Hellenism ([45]; [45*], p. 307).
51a. Academy of Plato founded by Gemistus Pletho in Italy. His work Teaching on the state did not survive [45]
51b. Plato's famous ancient Academy. Plato's well-known work Republic was preserved until today, probably being just that of Gemistus Pletho



Duplicates in Greek Chronology
52a. Period of rise of Navarrese state and Mistra's despotate from war in Greece c. 1400 A.D. until rise ofOttomanSultanateinmid-15thc. A.D. Thus, this was c. 50-year-long period, turning-point in medieval Greek history
319
52b. Rise of Sparta from Peloponnesian war until rise of Macedon in mid4th c. B.C. Thus, this was c. 50year-long period until 350 B.C., well consistent with medieval epoch under 1,810-yearshift (see left column)
11.6. The medieval Mahometans and the ancient Macedonians. Mahomet II and Philip II
Medieval Greece
53a. Peloponnesus' hegemony (and that ofMistra's despotate) ended in mid15th c. A.D. when new powerful force, Turks, appeared. Extending their influence, they stormed on Byzantine Empire. This ended history of medieval Greece as independent state, new military and political force being Mahometans [45]
54a. Mahometans were mostly in Turkey
(=TRK). Turks' invasion of Byzantine Empire and Greece started in 1446 A.D. Greeks could not withstand them, and, as once in Xerxes' times, faced again barbarian Asia ready to storm on Peloponnesus [45]
Ancient Greece
53b. Sparta's hegemony ended in mid4th c. B.C., and new powerful force, Macedon, appeared. This "Macedonian" period ended ancient history of Greece as independent state ([110], p. 270), new military and political force being Macedonians (cf. close term "Mahometans" m left column) ([110], p. 270)
54b. Macedon is located in Thrace (= TR). "By the mid-4th c. (B.C.A. F.), most of the Hellenistic world was under the Macedonian kings' hegemony ... Sparta, and all other polises a fortiori, could not organize whatever considerable resistance" (ibid.), events occurring in 4th c. B.C.
Under the 1,810-year shift, we obtain that 446 A.D. should be superimposed on 364 B.C., i.e., just in the mid-4th c. B.C. Thus, the Mahometan and Macedonian rises are made coincident.
55a. Famous Mahometan ruler, sultan Mahomet II (Mehmed II according to (40]), called Conqueror. Founded vast Mahometan monarchy
55b. Famous Macedonian king Philip II, "true creator of the Macedonian power" ([110], p. 271), which turned into hegemonic state



320
56a. Greece vanished from political arena as independent force, and Mahomet II ascended throne in 1451 A.O. [45]
Enquete-Codes
56b. Greece vanished from scene as independent force, and Philip II ascended throne in 359 B.C. (ibid.)
Under the 1,810-year shift, we derive the ideal coincidence, viz., 1810 - 1451 = 359 B.C. The dates on the right and left become precisely coincident.
57a. Mahomet II was crowned at age of 21 and reigned 30 years. Starting with Osman I (Ottoman I) in 1298 A.O., all rulers (including Mahomet II) were Osmans, or Ottomans(= TMN) [45], [74]
57b. Philip II was crowned at age of 23 and ruled for 24 years in 359336 B.C. ([283], p. 476). He was Aminta'sson (ibid.,p.462). Among his predecessors, there were several kings with name Amyntas (= MNT) [74]
The terms TMN and MNT are different only in the order of their consonants, which we have already repeatedly encountered when analyzing Herodotus.
58a. History of Ottoman Sultanate until Mahomet II embraced 1298 (when Empire was founded) to 1451 A.O. (coronation of Mahomet II), lasting for 153 years [74]
58b. Macedon's history until Philip II embraced 540-359 B.C. (when he mounted throne). Thus, duration of this period is c. 180 years
The numbers 180 and 153 are sufficiently close.
59a. Ottoman Sultanate's founder Ottoman I(= TTMN). Under 1,810year shift, we obtain 1810-1298 = 512 B.C. (1298 A.O. = year when Sultanate was founded)
59b. Macedonian state's founder Aminta I (= MNT). 512 B.C. (year of its foundation) fits into second half of 6th c. B.C
60a. WithMahometll,newepochstarted, 60b. From Philip II, new epoch started, creation of great empire in Asia and creation of enormous Macedonian Europe Empire (including parts of Asia and Europe)
61a. In 1453 A.O., important event occurred, i.e., fall of Byzantine Empire, taking of Constantinople by Turks
61b. In 364 B.C., important event in Greek history occurred, i.e., separation of Byzantium ([110], p. 353)
Under the 1,810-year shift, we obtain 1810- 1453 = 357 B.C., which is extremely close to 364 B.C. Recall that the original name of Constantinople was Byzantium [40].



Duplicates in Greek Chronology
62a. Mahomet II started his conquering expeditions in 1453 A.D. Osmans attacked Constantinople with all their might. Byzantines prepared for siege (cf. ancient "Byzantine Empire")
63a. Constantinople(= Byzantium) was capital of greatest empire, and strongly fortified both from land and sea, being strongest medieval fortress [40], [45]
64a. Two flotillas of Genoese and Venetian ships were sent to Constantinople ([40], p. 45)
65a. At Constantinople's (= Byzantium's) walls, fierce sea-battle ending in defeating sea-forces of Mahomet II ([40], p. 46). Considerable part of Turkish fleet was burned down
66a. Constantinople's siege lasted for long time. Attempts to storm it from land failed. Constantinople received aid from sea (ibid.)
67a. Byzantine army commander Justinian was betrayed and fled ([40], p. 53)
68a. Siege of Constantinople stopped temporarily. "The Council convened. The great vizier advised the sultan to come to terms with the Turks" ([40], p. 47)
321
62b. Philip II started his conquering expedition in 340 B.C. People of Perinthus asked for "... Byzantine (!-:-A. F.) and Athen's help. The Byzantines (!-A. F.) sent them special machines for siege" ([283], p. 473)
63b. Byzantium's role was very great in ancient times. Philip II " besieged the biggest city on the seas" (ibid.)
64b. Philip's deeds were declared peaceviolating, and two flotillas were forwarded for the Byzantines' help (ibid.)
65b. At Byzantium's walls, big sea-battle occurred, in which "... allies defeated the Macedonian fleet, and thereby made themselves the masters of the seas" (ibid.)
66b. Byzantium's siege by Philip II lasted long time. "The inland siege of the city was little effective, since Byzantium received all the necessary from the sea" (ibid.)
67b. Philip II slandered Byzantine army commander before Byzantines (ibid.)
68b. Byzantium's siege was temporarily stopped, Philip II unable to take it (ibid.). Then Philip II lifted siege
69a. Events occurred in 1453A.D. (ibid.) 69b. Events occurred m 340-339 B.C. (ibid.)
The difference between the right and left dates is 1,793 years, which is almost equal to the value of the shift by c. 1,800 years.



322
70a. Mahomet II started new siege, and Constantinople fell in 1453 A.D. Armies of Byzantine's allies were defeated, and Greece and Byzantine Empire completely lost their independent existence ([45*], p. 349). Greece was completely conquered in 1459 A.D. (ibid., p. 353)
Enquete-Codes
70b. Philip II lifted siege, but again attacked Byzantine forces and their allies following year and completely defeated them in battle of Chaeronea in 338 B.C., Greece and Byzantium being completely conquered ([283], pp. 474-475)
Under the 1,800-year shift, we obtain 1800 - 338 = 1462 A.D., which practically coincides with 1459 A.D. We now point out to the original of the well-known "ancient" battle of Chaeronea. Having sent his pashas with the army to Morea in 1459 A.D., where fighting for life was going on, Mahomet II crossed the Isthmus of Corinth the following year in order to turn the ill-fated country into one large inferno. The cities and castles were stormed ([45]; [45*], p. 356).
71a. Period of history from c. 1470 until 1485 A.D. (First Mahomet II, and then Bayazet (1480-1485 A.D.)). Ottoman Sultanate under Osmans, its symbol being crescent and two horns. Medieval Ottoman Empire's map is very much like that ofempire of Alexander the Great
72a. Greeks' flee from Byzantine Empire, Hellenism begins to spread across medieval Europe, starting with mid-15th c. ([45], p. 360)
71 b. Alexander the Great in 336-323 B.C. Alexander's empire. In East, he was called Iskander (two-horned) (cf. crescent!). His empire was of clearly "Eastern" nature
72b. Creation of Alexander's empire led to another well-known phenomenon, viz., spreading of Hellenism in "ancient world" ([283], p. 297)



APPENDIX 1
Volume Graphs for the "Biographies" of the Holy Roman
Emperors of the 10-13th cc. A.D. Additional Chronological
and Statistical Data of Ancient History
Figure 90 represents the volume graphs of the "biographies" of the Holy Roman emperors in the 10-13th cc. A.D. By a "biography", we understand that part of the text which describes the events during an emperor's reign. If its description began at a time not clearly specified, then as the start of the "biography", we took the first mention of a ruler. In Fig. 90, these volumes were calculated for the three different, but certainly a priori dependent, monographs by F. Kohlrausch [274], E. Fedorova [303] and C. Bemont and G. Monod [124], who, among other things, described the 10-13th cc. A.D. (F. Kohlrausch, A History of Germany, from the Earliest Period to the Present Time, D. Appleton and Co., New York, 1896; E. F. Fedorova, Famous Italian Cities, Moscow University Press, Moscow, 1985 (in Russian); C. Bemont and G. Monod, Histoire de ]'Europe en Moyen Age, Paris, 1921).
The emperors' numbers (according to traditional chronology) were marked off along the horizontal axis, and the volumes of their "biographies" derived from the above books along the vertical axis. The correlation of the volume graphs was thus made manifest. For comparison, we also showed the volume graphs for the biblical kings' "biographies". From the traditional point of view, they do not depend on the above, but are to some extent correlated, as seen from the graph. It is remarkable that a correlation of this sort is discovered only in the case where at least one of the texts in question describes the events traditionally dated earlier than the 13th c. A.D. In the 13-20th cc. A.D. the suggested methods (including the one described in the book) did not lead to any divergence from the traditional dates. In Part 1, the author has formulated certain hypotheses which may possibly clarify the reason for the appearance of such a correlation. Figure 90 is "decoded" in the table below, where the first column contains the rulers' numbers, the second one the Holy Roman emperors' names, and the third the volumes of their "biographies" in lines according to F. Kohlrausch (see [274*]), whereas the scale along the vertical axis is ten times larger. We stress that the choice of a scale on the vertical axis is not important, since we give first priority to the distribution of the local maxima graph, and neglect their absolute values. We, therefore, measure the volumes either in pages or lines of the corresponding editions, without reducing them to a unique absolute scale. Different measuring units do not

influence the distribution of the local maxima. Thus, the fourth column contains the "biography" volumes in lines according to C. Bemont and G. Monod (see [124*]), and the fifth is made up in accordance with E. F. Fedorova [303). The seventh column contains the "biography" volumes in verses of Judaean biblical kings, Column 6 contains their names, the eight column contains the durations of the Holy Roman emperors' reigns, and Column 9 those of the biblical rulers.
The local maxima of all the graphs were marked in Fig. 90. That the points of the splashes are correlated is seen explicitly.

APPENDIX 2
When Was Ptolemy's Star Catalogue Really Compiled? Variable Configurations of the Stars and the Astronomical Dating
of the Almagest Star Catalogue
This work was done by A. T. Fomenko, V. V. Kalashnikov, and G. V. Nosovsky and was initially published (in Russian) in Stability Problems of Stochastic Models, 1988, Systems Research Institute, Moscow [310]. See also [313,317]. This work is devoted to describing a new method of dating the moving configurations of stars on the celestial sphere. The method was tested on several star catalogues whose dates are well known (Tycho Brahe, etc.) and also on several star catalogues which were generated artificially. Then the same method was applied to the Almagest. The results obtained do not confirm the traditional dating of the Almagest (2nd century A.D. or 2nd century B.C.) but shift its dating to the epoch 600-1300 A.D.
1. History of the Problem and Subject of the Work
,'W,
Interest in the problem of dating the Almagest (compiled by Ptolemy) is not new. J
See, for example, The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy, a review of the problem by the)'
well-known astronomer R.R. Newton [321], as well as the fundamental investigation •t
of C. H. F. Peters and E. B. Knobel [320]. ''.i Increased interest in the problem followed the publication of the investigations of}{
N. A. Morozov in 1928 [13], which raised well-grounded objections to the traditional :r
dating of the 2nd century A.D. or the 2nd century B.C. for the Almagest. Much ;J
interesting and critical material is also contained in the book by R. R. Newton fi mentioned above. Newton formulated the well-grounded conjecture that the main { part of the astronomical data in the Almagest had been falsified. '·''
New impetus to a deeper investigation of this problem was given by the works of!);:
A. T. Fomenko [18-20, 24, 295] in 1980-1987, in particular by the paper The jump of} the second derivative of the moon's elongation [20]. Fomenko introduced some new }l
empirico-statistical methods for the analysis of ancient narrative texts (historical 'f. chronicles, etc.). He then investigated the whole system of ancient chronology and~ summarized all these results in a global chronological diagram (see details in [18-~~
22]). The recent paper by Y. N. Efremov and E. D. Pavlovskaya [325] attempted tof confirm the traditional dating of the Almagest star catalogue based on the proper.} motions of the stars. Reasons for the failure of this attempt are explained briefly :i: below. ;; In the present work we describe a method for dating the moving (variable)

figurations of stars on the celestial sphere. The proper motions of modern stars are known today with great exactness, so that it is possible to calculate their positions in the past and to compare these calculated coordinates with the corresponding coordinates shown for these stars in ancient star catalogues. This then permits a determination of approximate dates for the observations used in compiling the ancient catalogue and hence of the date of its compilation.
The geometrical-statistical method devised by the present authors has been tested on several star catalogues with well-known compilation dates as well as on several star catalogues generated artificially. In the case of artifical catalogues, the "date of observation" was, of course, known to the compilers but not to the investigators. This method of dating appears to be very accurate: all dates calculated by our method coincided with real (known) dates. The same method was then aplied to the Almagest star catalogue: the results obtained do not confirm the traditional dating of the Almagest and shift its dating to the Arabian epoch, i.e., 600-1300 A.D.
Our work (carried out in the period 1985-1989) is based on careful analysis of all geometrical, statistical, and calculation aspects of the problem. We do not touch on any historical problems; the work is purely geometrical and statistical. The method is based only on the analysis of numerical data contained in the star catalogues, namely, on the analysis of the coordinates of the stars.
2. Some Notions from Astronomy
We now formulate some standard notions (see [320, [321), and Figure 113) to explain the problem and our results. Suppose that the stars belong to the celestial sphere with its center being the "eye of the observer". To fix the position of the stars, we need a spherical coordinate system. Two such systems were customarily used in the Middle Ages: the equatorial system and the ecliptical one. The equator of the celestial sphere is the circle of the intersection of the sphere with the plane of the earth's equator. Parallels and meridians can then be introduced onto the sphere. The equatorial latitude 8 is measured in arc degrees (-90° ~ 8 ~ 90°) and is called the declination of the star. The equatorial longitude a is measured in hours (0 <a~ 24hr) and is called the ascent of the star. The starting point for counting longitudes must be determined (see details below).
The intersection of the celestial sphere with the plane of the earth' orbit is called the ecliptic. The zodiacal constellations are distributed along the ecliptic. We can now define new latitudes and longitudes based on the ecliptic. The ecliptical latitude bis measured in arc degrees (-90° ~ b ~ 90°), and the ecliptical longitude I is also
measured in arc degrees (0 < I ~ 360°). The position of the starting point for counting longitudes (the "zero meridian") must be fixed. The intersection of the equatorial plane with the ecliptical plane is the "axis of the equinox". This axis intersects the celestial sphere at two points, the spring equinox and the fall equinox. The point of the spring equinox is taken as the origin in the calculation of equatorial and ecliptical longitudes.
These two coordinate systems are not fixed, they evolve in time for the following reasons:

(A) The axis of the earth's rotation (see radius vector in Fig. 113) moves ap-'. · proximately along the cone whose angle at its vertex equals about 20°27' (ini 1900 A.D.). In Fig. 113 this is the angle between ON and OP. This motion,, is called "precession" and its velocity is about 50" per year. A complete rev-> olution (rotation) of the axis ON requires about 26,000 years. Consequently~· the equatorial coordinate system and the axis of the equinox have a preces-' · sion which induces the precession of the longitudes (see the indicator C in;: Fig. 113).

(B) The earth's axis has smaller oscillations (the so-called nutations) as wellit as precession, but the maximum amplitude of these oscillations does not exceed 17".



The Geometry of Variable Configurations 349
(C) A third important perturbation is the oscillation of the ecliptic. This oscillation is induced by the oscillation of the plane of the earth's orbit. We let c(t) denote the angle between the ecliptic plane and the equatorial plane (Fig. 113). The function c(t) describes the ecliptic oscillations as a time function.
Here we take into consideration the precession of the longitude and the ecliptic oscillation but not the smaller oscillations such as nutations. The exact astronomical and mathematical theory of ecliptic motion was formulated by S. Newcomb. This theory is well known and has been generally accepted up to the present time; it is the basis of all modern calculations concerning the evolution of ecliptic and other parameters of the earth's motion. We have used Newcomb's theory and modern specifying equations (from the work of H. Kinoshita [322]) in calculating the functions a(t) and c(t), using a computer. Various other astronomers (including C. H. F. Peters, E. B. Knobel, and R.R. Newton) have used Newcomb's theory as a basis for calculating the positions of the stars in ancient times from modern exact data. The considerable proper motions of some stars is also taken into account-actually we consider all stars as moving stars. All data about the directions and velocities of proper motions are contained in [323] and [326]. Most stars which are visible (to the naked eye) move very slowly, but there do exist stars (the bright ones) whose position on the celestial sphere has changed by several degrees over two thousand years. We can consider all proper motions of the stars during the time interval from 500 B.C. to the present as rectilinear motions. Finally, we also consider the refraction effect, which is important for the stars close to the horizon.
We measure time t, using centuries as units. The value t = 0 corresponds to 1900 A.D. The coordinates of "modern" stars are reduced to this year. The value
t = 1 corresponds to 1800 A.D. and so on. But the parameter t must not be an
integer. For example, the value t = 3.75 corresponds to 1525 A.D. The parameter
t will change inside some time interval fixed a priori. For the Almagest, we choose this interval to be 0 :::; t :::; 25, i.e., from 600 B.C. to 1900 A.D.
3. Some Characteristics of the Ancient Star Catalogues
We study the star catalogues of Ptolemy (the Almagest), Tycho Brahe, and Hevelius. All these catalogues were worked out without telescopes. Each catalogue contains about 1000 stars, whereas modern catalogues contain about 5000 stars visible to the eye.
The modern catalogues use equatorial coordinates which can be measured more simply and accurately than ecliptical ones. The medieval and ancient catalogues mentioned above use the ecliptical coordinates. The ancient astronomer did not know about the small ecliptic oscillations and hence supposed the ecliptical coordinates to be "eternal" coordinates. In other words, they supposed that ecliptical latitudes did not change over time and that ecliptical longitudes changed with constant velocity induced by precession. The equatorial coordinates even of fixed stars (those without proper motions) change in a more complicated way. After the dis



350 Appendix 2
covery of the oscillations of the ecliptic, all "advantages" of ecliptical coordinates disappeared. Some of the stars in the ancient catalogues have proper names-they are the named stars. Usually these are very bright stars; among them are stars with considerable proper motion, for example, Arcturus. It is natural to suggest that proper names were given to stars that were important to ancient observers and to assume that the coordinates of such stars would have been measured with special care, and certainly several times. Hence these "named stars" can be thought of as the "information kernel" of the ancient catalogue. Later we will see how this idea gets additional support from the numerical calculations. The information kernels can vary between catalogues, but in the actual catalogues listed above, these kernels are very similar. The named stars form a clearly visible basis (or frame) on the celestial sphere, making it very convenient to measure the positions of other stars (without proper names) relative to this system of basic points. The exactness, the accuracy, of each catalogue is very important for dating it. It is natural to suggest that the claimed accuracy of a catalogue corresponds to its scale, i.e., to the size of the unit in the scale used. For example, the size of the unit in the Almagest is 10', in Tycho Brahe's catalogue it is 1' and in Hevelius's catalogue it is 111 (see [324]). But many investigations (see [321] for example) lead us to conclude that the accuracy of the ancient catalogues must be considered most carefully. For example, R. R. Newton (see [321]) proves by statistical methods that the errors in the latitudes of some stars in the Almagest are 20', not 10', and that the error in the
arc deviation is equal to 1°12'. The last error contains some systematic error. When the systematic error is removed, the arc deviation error decreases to 30'. Thus we see that the accuracy of the latitudes of the stars in the Almagest is greater than their longitudes [321]. The accuracy of Tycho Brahe's catalogue is considered by modern specialists to be 2'-3' (but not 11). This fact was confirmed by our own investigations (see below). It is reasonable to suppose that the accuracy of Hevelius' catalogues is close to that of Tycho Brahe's, since the two observers used practically the same instruments, making the accuracy of Hevelius' catalogues about 2'-3', but of course not 111• This hypothesis is confirmed by our calculations.
4. Errors in the Coordinates in Ancient Catalogues
For lack of space we will not discuss the possible reasons for the appearance of errors in ancient catalogues but refer the reader to R. R. Newton's book [321]. Here we list only the most important facts.
(A) Analysis of the methods used in making ancient observations and 1uc;ao,,.11 coordinates shows that for actual catalogues the possible errors in the latitudes of the stars (latitude deviation) must be less, in a statistical sense, than the errors in longitudes and hence less than the errors in the arc distance stars). In other words, the latitudes shown in ancient catalogues are the firmest and most accurate coordinates of the stars, which is confirmed by our investigations.
(B) The longitude deviation can include some additional terms which are



The Geometry of Variable Configurations 351
result of the recalculation of the catalogues to eliminate the precession effect [321].
(C) The compilers of medieval and ancient star catalogues were neither aware of the refraction effect nor of the effect of the accumulation of errors in the observation and calculation of the coordinates of the stars, using the finite system of fixed basic points (named stars). Such errors actually do occur in these catalogues.
(D) Errors in the catalogues may have been introduced by copyists. In the original manuscripts of the Almagest, letters were used to denote figures, and this has caused difficulties in the interpretation of its numerical data. For example, the letters (or figures) ~, A, a are easily confused [320].
If we consider errors in the coordinates to have a random value, then (within the limits of the claimed accuracy of the catalogue corresponding to the value of the unit in the catalogue's scale) we can take this random value as a value, chosen from some homogeneous sequence (for example, normal). "Large deviations" or "spikes" can be attributed to the causes listed (see C and D). The hypothesis of randomness is unnatural for "spikes", making it necessary to examine all suspicious cases individually. Final conclusions cannot be drawn from calculations based on these "suspicious stars", so they must be removed from the list at the start. Several such cases are discussed in [320] and [321] and have been given careful consideration in our work.
5. Preliminary Analysis of the Almagest
We base our work on the summarized version of the Almagest as it appears in the fundamental work of Peters and Knobel [320]. The list of stars (about 1000 in all) contains some variants listed in [320]. At the first stage of our investigation, we did not question the star coordinates of the Almagest or the traditional assumption that their ecliptical coordinates correspond to the year 60 A.D. The numeration of the Almagest stars is that of F. Baily. Identification of the dim stars of the Almagest with modern stars is a complicated problem which cannot be solved in all cases. In other words, "who is who" among the unnamed stars is not at all clear. For the most part, the stars of the Almagest are identified only by their coordinates or by non-modern verbal descriptions, and these have many different interpretations. Identification of most of the Almagest stars with the corresponding modern stars was made by Peters and Knobel [320]. In order to satisfy our need for firm data, we have solved the problem of identification anew. For this purpose, we chose from the modern star catalogue the set of 30 named stars and 50 stars with v ~ 0.5" per year, where vis the velocity of proper motion. To solve the problem of "who is who" in the Almagest, we used Newcomb's theory. Namely, we calculated (using a computer) the ecliptical coordinates of all
the above stars at the times t = 1, 2, ... , 25 (i.e., from 600 B.C. to 1800 A.D.). Then we compared these coordinates with those given in the Almagest. This work appears to confirm in general the traditional identifications of the Almagest stars (see [320]) in almost all cases. We obtained some additional informa



352 Appendix 2
tion, namely the classification of all identified pairs of modern stars (modern as well as from the Almagest) according to the values of the arc distances between them. We also discovered several stars in modern catalogues (in particular o2 Eridanus) which can be identified for different times t with different Almagest stars. In other words, the identification of such stars (and consequently the answer to the question "who is who") is a function of time t. For o2 Eridanus, we get the following different stars: 778, 779, and 780 (in Baily's enumeration). Peters and Knobel also expressed doubts as to the identification of o2 Eridanus. These facts refute the work of Efremov and Pavlovskaya [325], since the proper motion of o2 Eridanus is the basic argument used by them to derive the date of compilation of the Almagest. Efremov and Pavlovskaya at first suppose that the Almagest was compiled in the second century A.D. and then "prove" that this is indeed true. In our opinion, stars such as o2 Eridanus must be excluded from consideration because a change in their identification essentially changes the dating of the catalogue. Having completed the computer identification of the stars, we obtained the list T of all the stars which have firm and unique identification with Almagest stars. This list T contains the following information about the identification of stars: (1) Baily's number i; (2) the ascent o:; and declination 8; of the star from the modern catalogue
at time t = O; (3) the velocity components of the proper motion of the star on the
celestial sphere; and (4) the ecliptical longitude h and the ecliptical latitude b; of the corresponding Almagest star. Let o:;(t) and 8;(t) denote equatorial coordinates and L;(t) and B;(t) denote the ecliptical coordinates of the i-th star from the modern catalogue (more precisely,
from list T) in the century t. These coordinates were calculated (by computer), taking into consideration the precession, the ecliptic oscillation, and the proper , motion of the stars. The problem of dating the Almagest is then reduced to finding
t 0 such that the set of coordinates V(to) = {L;(t0 ), B;(t0 )} is closest to the set of
coordinates VA = {l;, b;} for the corresponding Almagest stars. The simplicity of this idea is not consistent with the difficulty of solving the problem so formulated. Overcoming these difficulties is the content of the present work. Usually such a problem can be solved by choosing some natural distance between the sets V(t) and VA- Then one can determine the moment t 0 when this distance is minimal. It appears in our case, however, that the possible error in the calculation of t 0 is very large. For example, let a,(t) be the arc distance between stars with the
coordinates (L;(t), B;(t)) and (l;, b;) and let t; = arg(min a;(t)). It is easy to see that
if the coordinates of some Almagest star S have an error Ll and if v, is the velocity of
the star K; on the modern celestial sphere which is identified with S, then the error in the determination of t 0 ( using star K;) is about Ll/v;. Consequently, we can state only that the desired date t0 is in the time interval (t;' - Ll/v;, t; + Ll/v;). (More
precisely, we must consider the projection of v, on the straight line connecting the
modern star K, with the Almagest star S.) For example, in the case of the Almagest (using the most optimistic estimation), we have Ll ~ 15' and v ~ 1.5"/year. Here
14' ~ ✓(10')2 + (10') 2 , where 10' is the claimed accuracy of the Almagest and 1.5"/year is the velocity of a very fast star, namely Arcturus. Thus we see that the time interval of possible solutions t0 for this case is equal to about 1200 years. (This



The Geometry of Variable Configurations 353
result also contradicts those results obtained in [325).) For slower stars, this time
interval covers all values t = 0, l, ... , 25. In fact, the exactness of the method used by Efremov and Pavlovskaya (325] is less than that described above. Moreover, our calculation shows that by changing stars
in the configuration considered in [325] we can vary the desired date from t* = 13
to t* = 21. Since it was supposed in [325] that t* = 16.5, the results obtained there cannot be considered correct. Our numerical investigation confirmed the lack of exactness of other similar "pointminimum" methods. It appears that by slight variation of the initial data (for example, by changing the set of moving stars), we can vary the "point of minimum"
from t = 0 to t = 25. Moreover, it was discovered that the final result depends on the sort of distance used. This means that such results are extremely subjective. The information kernel of the Almagest consists of twelve stars, designated "vocatur" (i.e., named). The twelve stars (with their modern astronomical names and Baily's numbers in brackets) are: Arcturus (a Boo, 110), Sirius (a CMa, 818), Aquila (a Aql, 288), Previndemiatrix (e Vir, 509), Antares (a Seo, 553), Aselli (-y Cnc, 452), Procyon (a CMi, 848), Regulus (a Leo, 469), Spica (a Vir, 510), Lyra (a Lyr, 149), Capella (a Aur, 222), Canopus (a Car, 892).
Table 1 shows the deviation in latitudes IB;(t)- b; Ifor all these stars (in minutes) for several values oft.

The values t = 18 and t = 21 correspond almost exactly to the traditional dates for the lives of Ptolemy and Hipparchus. (Recall that some experts attribute the Almagest to Hipparchus.) Table 1 confirms that it is senseless to date a catalogue using the "exact minimum" of some usual distance between stars or between star configurations. The value to as the absolute minimum of a distance is very "sensitive" to small variations in the initial data.

Table 1 also shows that for seven of the twelve stars the latitude deviations IB;(t)
b; I are more than 10' for all t from the a priori time interval. (10' is the accuracy claimed by the compiler of the Almagest.) For the star 510 (Spica), the following inequality holds:
max IBs10(t) - bs1ol < 10'.
l~t~21
For another four stars, no more than two stars are contained in a 10-minute interval. And this is true for all t ! This fact is particularly surprising since it is valid for the bright, named (i.e., well-known) stars, the very ones whose coordinates must have been measured most carefully by the ancient astronomer. We conclude that the Almagest star catalogue must contain some systematic errors.
In the next sections, we shall try to realize two main objectives: (a) to calculate all systematic errors in the Almagest, and (after removing these systematic errors from the stars' coordinates) (b) to calculate some time interval spanning the actual time of observation. As was shown by the preceding calculations, we can determine only the time interval, not the "exact point of minimum".
6. General Description of the Method of Dating
6.1. Types of errors occurring in the catalogues. We have shown that all attempts to calculate the exact point of minimum of a particular distance between modern star configurations and those of the Almagest fail. As pointed out above, errors in the coordinates of individual Almagest stars are great in comparison with the velocities of proper motions of most fast, bright stars. So we must examine very carefully all possible errors in the catalogues. We divide these errors into three types: systematic errors, random errors, and spikes.
Systematic errors appear as a result of global measurements or recalculations of coordinates which induced the global rigid translation (motion, shift) of the stars on the total celestial sphere (or on a significant part of it). Such systematic errors do occur in the Almagest (see below). Random errors are the result of a lack of exactness of individual measurements attributable to the use of imprecise instruments. Errors of this kind cause a random movement of each star on the celestial sphere. It is reasonable to assume that these errors have random distribution with zero mean value. Such errors usually do not exceed the size of the scale unit (of the instrument). Spikes are caused by circumstances beyond the control of the observer and unknown to him-for example, the errors oflater copyists, refraction, etc. These errors usually change the coordinates only of single stars; their values are likely to be considerably larger than the unit scale of the instrument and occur rarely.
6.2. Systematic errors. Systematic errors are most frequently introduced by the recalculation of equatorial coordinates into ecliptical ones. Such recalculation is inevitable, since all astronomical instruments are based on the earth and initially are correlated with the equatorial coordinate system. The transition to the ecliptical system was accomplished with the aid of mathematical formulas, special globes, or



The Geometry of Variable ConfiEurations 355
astronomical instruments. Thus the term "recalculation" is to be interpreted very broadly, including as it does, formulas, globes, instruments and so on. In any case, in order to compile a catalogue using ecliptical coordinates, the astronomer must know the position of the ecliptic and the position of the axis of the equinox OC in the epoch to which the catalogue is to be reduced (Fig. 113). This position is known with some error r1 (in the general case). The error in the calculation of the point C (along the ecliptic) induces the systematic rigid translation of the longitudes of all stars. Next, the astronomer may make a mistake r 2 in the definition of the longitudes of the stars simultaneously. These two errors are summed to arrive at the
systematic error in the longitude r = r1 + r 2• The next possible systematic error is induced by translation (shift) of the equinox point C along the meridian. In other words, it is the error in the latitude of the point C, since this point is translated from the equator. This error is denoted by /3
in Fig. 114. Instead of /3, we can introduce a parameter r.p, which is an angle between the real axis of the equinox and the line of intersection of the equatorial plane with the "catalogue's" ecliptical plane, see Fig. 114. These two errors, /3 and r (or r.p and r), totally describe all possible translations
of the point C on the sphere: any error is some combination of /3 and r (or r.p and r).
A third error, which we denote by 1 , may appear in the calculation of the angle c: between the equator and the ecliptic (Fig. 113). In other words, 1 is the error in the
calculation of the position of the pole of the ecliptic on the celestial sphere. All these errors were included in our calculation formulas and in the equations of the ecliptic motion. In addition, all possible pairs /3, 1 were tested in the calculation
process. By varying /3 and , , we can slightly shift (or swing) the ecliptical coordinate system. It is clear that any rotation of the celestial sphere can be decomposed into the product of three orthogonal rotations defined by the parameters r, /3, and ,. Thus, they include all other possible systematic errors (if they occur). The possibility of systematic errors in the Almagest has been discussed by many authors, see [320], [321], and [13]. Let us summarize the results of these discussions. The error r can be induced by the observer's attempt to reduce a star catalogue to some date other than the actual date of observation. The catalogue of Tycho Brahe, for example, was reduced to the "perfect" calendar date of 1600 A.D. Or the astronomer may try to hide the real date of observation by reducing his catalogue to another epoch [321], [13]. Practically, such a translation (shift) of a catalogue is realized in a very simple way: it is sufficient to add some constant (corresponding to precession) to the longitudes of all the stars in the catalogue. Sometimes the error r is a consequence of a change in the starting point for the calculation of longitudes. Ancient astronomers did calculate longitudes starting from different initial points on the ecliptic-Copernicus, for example. This change required the addition of some constant to the longitudes of all the stars. What about the errors /3 and ,? The equatorial latitudes of the stars can be determined from the observations in such a simple and exact way (see [321]) that we may assume that the error /3 (at the time of the actual observation, of course)
must be practically zero. In other words, /3 ~ 0. The error , has quite a different character. Accurate determination of the ecliptic



356 Appendix 2
position requires complicated calculations or nontrivial observations and measure
ments, so that the order of magnitude of the error r must be considerably greater
than that of the error (3. References [320] and [13] both discuss this systematic error.
Some authors estimate the value of r to be about 20' or 30'. Our calculations give
a value of r ~ 20'.
6.3. Random errors and spikes. Let us consider the star (from our list T) with Baily
number i, with I; and b; being its ecliptical coordinates. We denote by L;(t, T, (3, r)
and B;(t, T, /3, r) the ecliptical longitude and latitude of this star, calculated for
time t, and taking into account the proper motion of the star and the errors r, /3,
and ,. From a modem catalogue (i.e., for t = 0), we determine the equatorial
coordinates a;, 6; of the i-th star and calculate the coordinates a;(t), 6;(t) of the same star at time t. These coordinates are converted to ecliptical ones (for the same time t) using the equation of ecliptic oscillation, the precession angle, and the corresponding rotation of the angle i(t) about the equinoctial axis. Then we rotate the ecliptic for the same small angles /3, 1 , and T. In other words, we determine
(for time t) the ecliptic perturbations defined by the systematic errors (3, 1 , and T.
The resulting star coordinates are then L;(t, T, (3, r) and B;(t, T, (3, r), using the same ecliptic coordinate system as was used by the compiler of the Almagest star catalogue. It is now possible to compare the Almagest coordinates I;, b; of the i-th star with its calculated coordinates L;(t, T, (3, 1 ), B;(t, T, (3, 1 ).
Let us consider the following latitudinal and longitudinal deviations: ilb(i,t,/3, 1 ) = B;(t,(3, 1 ) - b;,
A1(i,t,r,J3,,) = L;(t,r,/3, 1 )-1;.
Here we use the obvious fact that the latitude B;(t, T, /3, r) (and hence the latitudinal,:
deviation) does not depend upon T, i.e., B;(t, T, (3, r) = B;(t, (3, ,). This is one of the· reasons why latitudes are more stable than longitudes. We will mainly use latitudes (which are not affected by the error r) and consider longitudes only as auxiliary data. If the measurements for the i-th star do not contain some unforeseen errors (copyist's mistake, refraction, etc.), then the deviations Ab and A1 must be within the accuracy interval characteristic of the given catalogue. The accuracy of a catalogue may be unknown. Moreover, the author of a catalogue may have chosen as the size<. of a unit in the catalogue scale the "record" accuracy, that is, the accuracy of obser- ): vations of the most famous (named) stars. To find and eliminate "spikes", we mayi :
use the following method (where the values of J3 and r are considered to be given).
1. The deviation 6 = [I:; LlHi, t, (3, 1 )/N]11 2 , where N is the number of stars in'
the list T. In fact, the value of 6 does not depend upon t, since most of the
stars have small proper motion. Thus we may take the resulting value of s: (or even 6/2) as the "record" accuracy A of a given catalogue. The "rear accuracy of the catalogue is the value 26-:- 36. We should also note that about 40% of the stars in the catalogue are within the "record" interval of accuracy:,
2. Stars whose coordinates are not within the "record" accuracy of the catalogue must be excluded from the investigation. Either these are "spikes," or else1 there were large errors in the measurement of their coordinates.



The Geometry of Variable Configurations 357
Since the number of these "spikes" is small, they do not affect 8. Nevertheless, we have excluded from the list T all stars whose coordinates were considered doubtful by Peters and Knobel [320). In addition, we excluded from the list T all stars whose coordinates can be considerably deformed by refraction (see Canopus in Table 1).
7. Statistical Analysis of the Ahnagest Star Catalogue
7.1. Preliminary remarks. The star catalogue in the Almagest contains 1025 stars. Their coordinates (ecliptical longitudes and latitudes) are given in the catalogue with a "claimed accuracy" of 10', i.e., the author believed that he really reached an exactness of 10'. All stars are collected in constellations which are arranged in a natural order from north to south. We have studied a "canonical" version of the catalogue from a fundamental work [320), which contains, in particular, results of the identification of the stars from the Almagest with "modern" stars. As we mentioned above, some "fast" stars had to be deleted from the catalogue because of their uncertain identification. One can find in [320) real errors in the coordinates of stars from the Almagest star catalogue. These errors were obtained by Peters, given that the dating of the Almagest is about 100 A.D. Although these calculations do not completely fit our situation, they can be used for deleting some "large deviations"
(more than 1°). We pointed out that such "doubtful" stars are not informative. As a result, we obtained a "clean catalogue" which contains 864 stars. This served as the subject of our statistical investigations. It is interesting to note that two stars (Canopus and Previndemiatrix), which were removed from the catalogue, turned to be spikes, see [310) for details. Let again Ii and bi be the ecliptical longitude and latitude of the i-th star from the clean catalogue. Let Li(t) and Bi(t) be real corresponding values for time t. A detailed and careful statistical analysis shows (see [321)) that the longitudes in the Almagest cannot be considered reliable numerical data. R. Newton showed in [321) that these data were the result of some complicated recalculations of the initial ones. But all specialists agree that latitudes are the initial observed data. We based our investigation on latitudes only. It turns out that an analysis of only latitudes gives us the possibility of separating all stars into groups having "well-measured" coordinates and groups having "badly measured" ones. We demonstrate in this paper that star catalogues (not only the Almagest but many others!) can be dated with the help of only latitude data.
Recall that the initial mean-square errors of star latitudes in the Almagest,
is equal to approximately 20'. This accuracy does not really depend on time t (0 ~ t ~ 25).
7.2. Classification of latitude errors. Let t* be the real (but unknown to us) year of the observation of the stars. We started with a decomposition of the real latitude



358 Appendix 2
deviation ~b;(t*) = b; - B;(t*) into two components:
(1)
Let us call the value l; the error of observation. It can be inspired by various • causes but there is no reason to discuss them here. It is natural to suggest that
l; is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean value El; = 0, and with finite
variation d =Ea= 0. We can call the component r;(t*) an error due to the wrong determination of the ecliptic pole. The position of the ecliptic was known to ancient astronomers with some error which can be characterized by the two parameters 'Y and <p, see Fig. 114. From the definitions, it is easy to obtain that

The Geometry of Variable Configurations 359
The idea of the proposed method is to determine 'Yi and r.pi by mathematical statistics and to compensate for these errors in order to deal with the real observation error only. Such an approach leads us to a dating method. The realization of the method is based on the fact that the parameters 'Yi and r.p; have a "group-like nature", i.e., they are the same for certain groups of stars (e.g., for constellations). This is really true in many cases, because 1; and r.p; do not depend on individual mea
surements but on preliminary determination of the ecliptic position for the groups mentioned. We assume that each constellation G in the ancient catalogue has an individual group error (i.e., this error is common for all stars of the constellation) in the determination of the position of the ecliptic pole. Let us parameterize it by the values
'Ya and I.Pa· That is, for each star i E G, we assume that the equalities 'Y; = 'Ya
and r.pi = I.Pa are true. Our aim is to estimate 'Ya and I.Pa for each group G of the catalogue. Note that the Almagest star catalogue contains 48 constellations.
7.3. Analysis of errors. Seven homogeneous regions in the Almagest star atlas. Let us suppose that t is the year of observation. Determine the value
(3)
for the i-th star and consider a constellation G containing N stars. Then we calculate values for i'a and 'Pa from the condition of minimization of the function
(4)
varying I and r.p. This problem can be easily solved analytically.
Let us call the value
a minimal mean-square error in the constellation G. We additionally calculate the
percentage p~in(t) of stars from G which satisfy to the inequality l~bi(t, -Ya, 'Pa)I < 10', i.e., (5)
The concrete values 8~in and p~in for different constellations G are listed below. The calculated values i'a and 'Pa are estimates of the real parameters 'Ya and I.Pa determining the group error. Though it is possible to prove some asymptotic properties of these estimates (see Theorem 1 below), we cannot consider i'a and cf>a too close to the real values 'Ya and I.Pa because we do not have firm statistical reasons for such closeness, as the total number of stars in the constellations does not exceed 20-30. Consequently, the values i'a and 'Pa cannot only serve to calculate a lower bound 8~in for the mean-square latitude error in the constellation G. The value p~in gives us some additional useful information about the group errors. We need a considerably larger group of stars to reliably estimate the group error. It turns out that there are seven regions in the Almagest star atlas which differ from one



The Geometry of Variable Configurations 361
Region A contains all the stars (NA = 249) of the northern part of the sky and of the zodiac which are located on the side of the Milky Way containing the point of the spring equinox.
Region B is a similar region (NB = 262) located on the other side of the Milky Way.
Region ZodA contains all the zodiacal stars (NzodA = 124) from region A and consists of six constellations: Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius.
Region ZodB contains all the zodiacal stars (NzodB = 168) from region B.
Region C contains all the southern stars (Ne = 116) located on the same side
of the Milky Way as region A.
Region D contains all the southern stars (ND = 143) located on the same side
of the Milky Way as region B. Region Mis the Milky Way (NM= 94).

Let us consider a "large" group of stars R and determine the parameters i'R and 1PR using the above relation (4) where one should replace G by R.
THEOREM 1. Let us suppose that for all stars i E R, the parameters 'Yi and 'Pi are equal for all i (see (1) and (2)) and coincide with 'YR and <pR, respectively. Then the values 'YR and IPR have the following properties:
(1) 'YR is a nonbiased estimate of the value 'YR having a normal distribution with a variation



362
where
s20 = [tsin2 Li{t)l / NR,
c20 = [tcos2 Li(t)] / NR,
d0 = [tsinLi{t)cos Li(t)]/NR.
(2) The estimate if>R is asymptotically ( when N R - oo) unbiased for the value tpR, and its distribution function can be calculated in terms of a normal distribution (we do not need a concrete formula here). (3) The value 8~in(t*) is an asymptotically nonbiased estimate for the real meansquare error
dl/2 = (E{l) 1/2
of the measurements. We shall call the parameters tpR and 'YR systematic errors in the group R. The value 8';_in characterizes the accuracy of the measurements in the region R. Thus, in order to discover groups of well-measured star groups, we can use the following algorithm.
Algorithm of the choice of well-measured star groups
{1) Calculate the values 'YR, if>R, 8';_in for each "large" group R of stars;
(2) choose the group R0 = arg min 8';_in;
(3) test that the calculated values ')'Ro and if>Ro are really parameters of the group error for all individual constellations in R0 • Consequently, Theorem 1 is valid.
All such constellations G form a set of well-measured stars. Of course, this set can be empty;
(4) delete the set R0 from the initial catalogue and repeat the algorithm beginning with step (1), etc.
As a result we obtain the hierarchy of well-measured collections of stars corresponding to the accuracy of the latitude measurements. Step {3) in the above algorithm will be discussed more fully in some comments which we shall give below. Let us note that the epoch t of real observations is unknown to us. Hence, all conclusions made above have a conventional character (given that the catalogue was compiled in the epoch t). Consequently, we need to test all values t from our a priori time interval. Because we know the trajectory of the real ecliptic pole from
Newcomb's theory, it is sufficient to obtain 'YR and if>R only for some fixed t = to. These two parameters determine the location of the "catalogue ecliptic" and then give us the possibility of calculating 'YR and if>R for all t.



The Geometry of Variable Configurations 363
7.4, Error values in the Almagest star catalogue. Computer calculations resulted in the following values of minimal mean-square errors (they practically do not depend on t):
81in = 16.5'; ~min 12 8'·
uzodA = · ,
8~in = 22.5';
8~n = 20.5'.
8'Jjin = 19.2';
8min - 19 3'·
ZodB - · ,
8Ein = 24.4';
It follows that the region Zod A is the most well-measured one in the star atlas. One can see the curve 'YzodA(t) (which, in fact is a line) in Fig. 116. This curve is
contained in the tolerance set corresponding to a confidence level f = 0.05. Similar
curves were obtained for all the other regions. We also calculated all functions ipR(t). An example can be seen in Fig. 116.
These calculations confirmed that the corresponding values /3R (which can be
obtained from 'YR and IPR) are rather small (l/3RI < 5'), i.e., /3 < rBut the tolerance sets for the curves t.p are very wide (about 40°). This fact indicates the "nonsystematic" nature of the parameter t.p. Indeed, the calculated value C,OzodA is only the average of the individual values 'Pa for six zodiacal constellations
(from G1 = Gemini to G6 = Scorpius). This fact can be considered as an indirect confirmation of the hypothesis that measurements were made by some instrument fixing an angle between the ecliptic and the equator (of course, with some error in the value of this angle). It is also probable that the axis of the rotation was fixed each time a measurement occurred. One such ancient instrument is the well-known "astrolabe" or "armillary sphere" described by Ptolemy. Now let us turn to the procedure of testing the hypothesis that the value i'zodA
determined by our calculations is common for all constellations in Zod A, i.e., this value really represents the group error. For each constellation G in Zod A, we cal
culate and compare the corresponding "initial" error 8;in = 8a(t, 0, 0), "minimal" error 8;in(t) and an error 8'g, which results after rotation over the angles i'zod A (t) and f.PzodA (t), i.e.,
8'g = 8G (t, i'zodA (t), f.PzodA (t)) ·
The result is shown in Fig. 117 for t = 100 A.D. Similar calculations were made
for all t. We can see from Fig. 117 that the resulting effect induced by the "optimal" individual rotation for each individual constellation practically coincides with the effect induced by the "common" rotation calculated for the total Zod A. We can also see the additional confirmation of the nature of the group error i'zod A (t) in Fig. 118 where we demonstrate graphs of the percentages of the stars with latitude deviations not exceeding 10' after a corresponding "optimal" rotation (see p~in) and without rotation (initial percentage p~ ). We also investigated the neighbourhoods of eight named stars: Antares, Arcturus, Aselli, Lyra, Capella, Regulus, Spica. Two of these stars (Arcturus and Procyon) have a large velocity of proper motion. It turned out that the group errors for all these stars are the same (or very close) as those for the stars in Zod A. Numerical data contained in the star catalogue

are not sufficient to determine reliable group errors for neighbourhoods of only two stars: Aquila and Sirius. This was the reason why we excluded them from further consideration.
8. The Dating of the Almagest Star Catalogue
8.1. Statistical dating procedure. Let I be the set of eight named stars (see above) and
Ll(t, 1, <p) =max jAbi(t, 1 ,<p)j.
iEI
We base our dating procedure on the hypothesis that the latitudes of all named stars from I must have individual errors of not more than 10' in the year t* of the observations. In other words,
and the value , belongs to the statistical tolerance interval (see Fig. 116). Corresponding adoptable values of, are "marked" by points in Fig. 116. Consequently, we claim that the time interval 600 A.D. ::::; t* ::::; 1300 A.D. can be considered as a dating interval. Of course, this interval depends on different parameters in general: claiming accuracy (10'), confidence probability c, and some others. The stability of the method will be analysed in Section 9 below.
8.2. Geometrical dating procedure. Though we have determined a dating interval, some doubts about it can appear due to the statistical nature of some of the assertions. In reality, we based our assertions on the fact that group errors for neighbourhoods of the eight named stars are the same. This fact was proved with the help of statistics. Hence, there is some positive probability (though it is very small) that this fact is wrong. Let us again consider the value A(t, 1 , <p) and find for every t the quantities
and
Amin(t) = A(t, lgeom(t), <pgeom(t)).
These quantities depend only on the position of the eight named stars, whereas "YzodA(t) and SozodA(t) do not depend on them (they depend on the position of all stars in ZodA). It is clear that Amin(t) ::::; 10' if 600 A.D. ::::; t ::::; 1300 A.D. But it turned out that Amin(t) ::::; 10' if and only if 600 A.D. ::::; t ::::; 1300 A.D. (see Fig. 119). Besides, '&eom(t) ~ "YzodA(t) for these t (see Fig. 116). Hence, this confirms without any stat1stical arguments that the above interval is a dating interval. There do not exist a I and <p such that the inequality
A(t, ,, <p) ::::; 10'
holds when t < 600 A.D. or t > 1300 A.D. We confirmed also that the systematic
error calculated with the help of statistics (using the coordinates of all stars in Zod A)

Figure 119. Graph of latitudinal deviation. The proof that the star catalogue in the Ahnagest was compiled in 600-1300 A.D.
is, in fact, "geometrically optimal" for the eight named stars. Let us illustrate this result by means of Table 3. The four stars 818, 288, 509, and 892 are the spikes which were previously removed from consideration. Figure 120(1) shows graphs of individual latitudinal deviations dependent on t
for the eight stars, given that 1 = 21', (3 = 0. Hence,
(1) we confirmed the accuracy claimed by the compiler of the Almagest star catalogue;
(2) we calculated the time interval containing the actual date of observation. We also proved that the catalogue could not have been compiled (on the basis of actual observations) outside this time interval;
(3) we proved that the compiler made an error in the determination of the position
of the ecliptic pole and calculated it ("Y = 20'); besides, he made an error in
the determination of the position of the equator (/3 < 5'). It is also important to note that the systematic error "Y explains the existence of a strange "Peters' sinus" in latitudinal deviations for zodiacal stars [320, p. 6];
(4) we defined the information kernel (eight named stars) in accordance with the accuracy of the measurements of the coordinates.

9. Stability of the Method
1. Our calculations showed that the decreasing of the confidence probability e
(beginning with e = 0.2) does not shift the time interval of probable dating. We
also obtained that this interval does not depend on the assumption of normality of the distribution of random variables {i (a kind of robustness). 2. Let us show how the final results depend on the content of the group of named stars (information kernel). Namely, let us consider a subset of this group. Of course, the dating time interval will be changed (more exactly, it will increase). For example, if we remove Arcturus (the fastest star in the group), then the left boundary of the dating time interval shifts to approximately 350 A.O. but it still does not touch the traditional period of Ptolemy. Some useful information about the dependence on the content of the group of named stars is contained in Fig. 121. There, for some fixed t, the empirical distribution functions
F(t)(x) = #{i: ILl(i,t,,,'P)I < x}/12
are shown.
We see that the "best" distribution function corresponds to t = 10 (i.e., ~
1000 A.O.) and 1 = 21'. This confirms the assertion above.
3. Let us change the accuracy level Ll. Recall that we started with Ll = 10'. Then
the "epoch of Ptolemy" will be included only when Ll = 25'. 4. Now consider not only the "rigid rotation" of the celestial sphere (as group errors), but also an arbitrary diffeomorphism of the coordinates (which is, however,

close to an identity mapping) reflecting possible distortions (deformations) of the astronomical instruments. Then it occurs that we can reach the "epoch of Ptolemy" only for such deformations which are implied by about a 4% deviation of real instruments (e.g., the armillary sphere) from ideal ones. This is quite impossible, even for usual "common" instruments (let alone scientific ones).
Consequently, our results are stable with respect to the different deviations of both the numerical data and the proposed assumptions.
10. Dating of Other Catalogues
10.1. Tycho Brahe's catalogue. The observations of Tycho Brahe were made at the end of the 16th century; in the edition used for this study [324], the catalogue is reduced to the year 1600. We choose the following 14 bright named stars as the information kernel of the catalogue: Arcturus (110), Spica (510), Lyra [Vega] (149), Aquila (288), Antares (553), Castor (424), Sirius (818), Pollux (425), Procyon (848), Denebola (488), Capella (222), Caph (189), Regulus (469), and Shiat (317).
This list is not the same as the total list of named stars in the catalogue; these

Figure 120(2). The graph of maximal latitudinal deviation for eight well-measured bright stars in the Almagest
particular stars have been chosen because most of them are also named stars in the Almagest. It is very interesting to compare the results of our calculations for the two catalogues.
In Fig. 122 we show the graphs oflatitudinal deviations for the named stars listed
above. These graphs were calculated for the optimal values "Y = 0 and /3 = 0, as determined for the catalogue of Tycho Brahe, using the statistical dating procedure.
The same values "Y = 0 and /3 = 0 were determined using the geometrical dating procedure. Tycho Brahe did not make any significant systematic error in his determination of the position of the ecliptic pole. This is not surprising for an astronomer working in the 16th century. On the other hand, the 1' accuracy claimed by Tycho Brahe for his catalogue is not achieved even for the well-knowq named bright stars. In fact, his accuracy is about 3' for the set of named stars listed above. Thus our result confirms the opinion of other experts that the actual accuracy of Tycho Brahe's catalogue is about 2' or 3', but not as little as 1'.
Taking the "claimed accuracy" .6. = 3', we obtain two solutions for the date of the
catalogue with respect to the total a priori time interval O~ t ~ 6; namely, between 1400 A.D. and 1500 A.D., and between 1500 A.D. and 1620 A.D. The first solution

is obtained if we eliminate Arcturus, the second by eliminating Antares. The second solution is preferable to the first because it realizes the absolute minimum of the mean deviation in latitude. Moreover, the value ~min in the second interval is less than in the first interval.
The traditional date assumed for Tycho Brahe's observations is about 1580 A.D., which is within the second time interval.
If we consider as the a priori interval the entire 16th century (i.e., 3 ~ t ~ 4),
then we obtain a unique solution which corresponds to ~ = 1' (i.e., to the accuracy
claimed by Tycho Brahe). This solution is 1589 A.D. ±10 years (Fig. 122).
The method of dating which is based on the distribution function of the er
rors yields the following optimal date for the observations: t* = 3.5 (i.e., about
1550 A.D.) as shown in Fig. 123. It is obvious that the curve t = 3.5 is the optimal curve because at almost every point it is higher than the other curves (corresponding to smaller or larger values oft).

10.2. Hevelius' catalogue. The version of Hevelius' catalogue used here is that of Baily [324]. The traditionally accepted date for this catalogue is the second part of the 17th century. We consider the information kernel of this catalogue to be almost the same as that of Tycho Brahe's catalogue, namely the twelve stars: Arcturus (110), Spica (510), Lyra [Vega] (149), Aselli (452), Antares (553), Castor (424), Sirius (818), Pollux (425), Procyon (848), Capella (222), Regulus (469), and Previndemiatrix [Vindemiatrix] (509). Our calculations show that the optimal values for /3 and I are f3 = 0 and 1 = 0,
meaning that Hevelius' catalogue does not contain any systematic errors. The graphs of individual latitudinal deviations in the time interval 1 ~ t ~ 4 are shown in Fig. 124. It is obvious that the actual accuracy of the latitudes in this catalogue is about 2', and not the 1" claimed by Hevelius. The scale unit in this catalogue is also said to be 1". Apparently Hevelius made an incorrect estimate of the accuracy of his catalogue (i.e., of his observations). The dating time interval becomes stable (relative to changes in A) when A~ 2.2'. For example, if A= 2.5', then T2 = (2.5 ~ t ~ 3.0),
i.e., from 1540 to 1650 A.D. If A= 3', then T2 = (2.35 ~ t ~ 3.85), i.e., from 1515 to 1650 A.D. The method of dating, which is based on the distribution function of the errors
(see formula (10)), gives us t* = 3 ± 0.5, i.e., from 1550 to 1650 A.O.

It is possible that Hevelius used not only personal observations but also previous catalogues, perhaps that of Tycho Brahe.

The application of the proposed statistical and geometrical procedures to Ulugbeck's catalogue [324] gave a dating interval 700-1400 A.D., which contains the real data of the compilation. Besides that, we found that a significant part of Ulugbeck's catalogue has a systematic error coinciding with that of the Almagest. It is very probable that this part was taken from the Almagest.

APPENDIX 3
Dating of the Almagest Based on the Occultation of the Stars
by Planets and Lunar Eclipses
1. Introduction
This work was done by A. T. Fomenko, V. V. Kalashnikov, G. V. Nosovsky and is a natural extension and continuation of the authors' results in the astronomical dating problem of the Almagest (see Appendix 2). The dating obtained above evidently contradicts the standard date of the creation of the Almagest, presumably 137 A.D. Thus, a serious problem arises: "Is the star catalogue of the Almagest "a late insertion" in the ancient and authentic text, or was the whole text of the Almagest (or its major part) written later than 600 A.D. and finally edited only in the late Middle Ages (1200-1300 A.D.)?" The astronomical observations collected in the Almagest were recently studied (in detail and professionally) by Robert R. Newton (321]. The result of his analysis can be formulated briefly as follows:
1) The Almagest contains the theory of the moon's motion, the sun's motion, planetary motion, and precession theory.
2) A large part of the astronomical data (for example, many "observations") collected in the Almagest can be theoretically calculated on the basis of Ptolemy's theory.
3) A large part of these astronomical "observations" is indeed nothing more than the result of such "pure theoretical calculations", which were made (according to R. Newton's results and opinion) by Ptolemy himself.
Consequently, it is senseless to use these "data" for any independent astronomical dating of the Almagest, because it implies only a reconstruction of the opinion (or conjecture) of some late author (Ptolemy? or some medieval astronomer?) about the date of occurrings of these astronomical events. The medieval authors sometimes solved the following problems: in which month of some ancient year (epoch) did some concrete astronomical event take place? But fortunately the Almagest contains some astronomical observations which can be calculated not only on the basis of Ptolemy's theory but also on the basis the latest medieval astronomical theories. The first among them are the '°"'"'"''"latitudes of 1020 stars in the star catalogue of the Almagest (see above). Later it turned out that the Almagest also contains some other "non-calculable" (in the Middle Ages) observation data.
376



Dating of the Almagest 377
A) Four observations of the occultation of stars by moving planets; B) Twenty one observations of lunar eclipses, mentioned in the Almagest.
The present work is devoted to the dating of the Almagest on the basis of the observation data A and B. Let us emphasize that here we actually date the text of the Almagest itself(and not only its star catalogue as in [310, 312-314, 317, 319]). We obtained the following results:
1) The observation data A (i.e., the occultation of the stars by planets) can be dated to the historical interval from 887 A.O. to 1009 A.O. It is remarkable that this time interval agrees with the interval obtained in [312-314) as a result of the star catalogue's independent dating.
2) The observation data B (i.e., lunar eclipses) are distributed, according to the Almagest, over a long time interval (its length is about 900 years). It turned out that it is the historical interval from 492 A.O. to 1350 A.O. Moreover, the most "dense" collection of the observations oflunar eclipses occurred in the 11th century A.O. And again we see an ideal correspondence with the results of the independent dating of the star catalogue of the Almagest and of the observation data of type A (see above).
3) In both cases, A and B, Ptolemy assigned observations of types A and B to the same "era" (the so-called "era of Nabonassar"). It is clear that now, after the dating of all observations A and B, we can obtain the beginning (the initial point) for this era by two independent methods. It is remarkable that these two methods lead to the same result: the beginning of Nabonassar's era is about 490 A.D. Let us recall that the traditional dating of this initial point (which is common today) is 747 B.C. It is important that the numerical data comprising, i.e.,
the latitudes in the star catalogue of the Almagest, the information about the occultation of the stars by planets, and the observations of lunar eclipses in the Almagest,
are completely independent. Thus, an excellent coincidence of all these datings in all three cases is a serious argument in favour of the opinion that the Almagest is the entire (genuine) document (text) which was originally created in the 10-llth centuries A.O. and then extended and enlarged in the middle of the 14th century A.O.
2. Dating of the Occultation of the Stars by Planets
The Almagest contains the description of only four occultation of stars by the planets [321], [327). Ptolemy says:
1) "Of the old observations, we took one which Timocharis records thus: In the year 13 of Philadelphus, Egyptianwise Mesore 17-18 at the twelfth hour, Venus appeared to have exactly overtaken the star opposite Vindemiatrix'' [327, p. 319; Section X.4).
2) "We took one of the old observations, according to which it is quite clear that in the year 13 according to Dionysius, Aigon 25 in the morning, Mars seemed to occult Scorpion's northern forehead" [327, p. 342; Section X.9).



378
3) "We again took one of the ancient observations very faithfully recorded, according to which it is quite clear that in the year 45 of Dionysius, Parthenon 10'
Jupiter at sunrise occulted the Southern Ass" [327, p. 361; Section Xl.3].
4) "We took for this again one of the faithfully recorded ancient observations, according to which it is clear that in the year 82 of the Chaldeans, Xanthicus 5, in the evening, Saturn was 2 digits below the Virgin's southern shoulder." [327, p. 379; Section XI.7].
According to the traditional identifications of Ptolemy's stars with the modern ones [321], we have the following information about occultations:
1) Venus covered the star 77-Virgo at about midnight.
2) Mars covered the star ,8-Scorpio in the morning.
3) Jupiter covered the star «5-Cancer at sunrise.
4) Saturn was "2 digits (2 units ?)" below the star ,-Virgo.
We checked all these traditional identifications and they were confirmed. For the calculation of the planets' locations in the past, we used a modern theory and concrete values of the averaged elements of the planets' orbits from the well-known book by G. N. Duboshin [346]. The accuracy of the calculations of latitudinal · position is equal to 1' (1 minute). Let us comment on how one needs to understand the words: "a planet occulted the star".
It is well known that the regular human eye can distinguish two points at an angular distance of about 1'. Extremely sharp eyes can distinguish two points at an angular distance of about 30" (30 seconds). Consequently, the occultation ("coincidence") of the star by some planet means in reality that the angular distance between them (from the point of view of the astronomer on the earth's surface) is equal to about 1'. It is clear that it was impossible for Ptolemy to calculate (even in principle) this remarkable astronomical event, because the accuracy of his theory was about 10'! The modern theory allows us to calculate the latitudinal positions of Venus and Mars in the past (for the historical time interval under consideration) with the accuracy of 1'. The accuracy of the calculations of the longitudes of Mars and Venus is equal to about 3'. It is quite sufficient for us because actually only the value of the latitude determines the occultation of the star by the planet. The longitude of the planet changes rapidly (in comparison with the latitude), and we can assume that the longitude is proportional to time. Consequently, the small error in the calculation of the longitude implies only a small error in the calculation of~ the covering time. Thus, in the cases of Mars and Venus, the covering described by Ptolemy can be calculated with great accuracy on the basis of modern theory.
The theory of the motion of Jupiter and Saturn is more complicated and less, accurate than for the case of Mars and Venus. V. K. Abalakin writes: "The averaged elements of the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto cannot be used for solving the stability problem and cannot serve over a period of millions of years... They are suitable for several centuries of our epoch" [328, p. 302].



Dating of the Almagest 379
But the situation in the Almagest's case is such that we do not need very exact formulas for Jupiter and Saturn. Really, according to the Almagest, the observation of Saturn has only auxiliary meaning because Saturn did not cover the star but was at a distance of uncertain "two units (digits)" from the star. What Ptolemy meant here by the term "digit" (unit)-is not quite clear. Consequently, it is senseless to calculate here the position of Saturn with an accuracy of l'.
In the case of Jupiter, Ptolemy states that "Jupiter covered (occulted) the star'. But our computer calculations based on modern theory shows that the angular distance between Jupiter and 6-Cancer has never been less than 15' (!) in the entire historical time interval. Consequently, we can try to find such moments only when the distance between Jupiter and 6-Cancer is about 15'-20'. We do not need the high accuracy of the formulas for this purpose. The accuracy which is guaranteed by the modern theory is sufficient for us.
Let us discuss the question of how Ptolemy distributes the astronomical events (1)-(4) over the time axis. The universal "era" for Ptolemy is "the Era of Nabonassar". Usually, Ptolemy assigns different astronomical events to the dates in terms of this era, though sometimes he uses other eras. Table 1 contains all datings of the coverings according to Ptolemy. One can see that Ptolemy used (at least twice) the following three eras: Nabonassar, "after the death of Alexander", Dionysius.
Table 1
The occultation Year according to Ptolemy of the star by the planet Era of Era "after the Era of Nabonassar death of Dionysius Alexander" 1. Venus 406 2. Mars 476 42 13 3. Jupiter 83 45 4. Saturn 519
A study of this table shows that the chronology of Ptolemy contains some errors (disagreements). The time distance between the occultations of the stars by Mars and Jupiter is equal to 41 years ifwe use the era of Alexander. But the same distance is equal to 32 years if we use the era of Dionysius. This implies two versions in terms of the era of Nabonassar: 517 and 508 years. We consider both versions.
Thus, we can now formulate an exact mathematical problem. Namely, we must find the year N, launching the following chain of astronomical events:
1) In the year N, Venus covered the star 77-Virgo about midnight.
2) In the year N + 70, Mars covered the star ,8-Scorpio in the morning.
3) In the year N + 111 (or N + 102), Jupiter covered the star 6-Cancer at sunrise.
4) In the year N + 113, Saturn was near the star ,-Virgo (below).



380 Appendix3
Let us discuss the accuracy which is to be met for the time distances between the different occultations. It is clear that we need to take into account possible errors because of Ptolemy's reduction of all the dates to the same era (Nabonassar). It is evident that this recalculation can lead to errors of 1-2 years only because the different eras used different beginnings of the calendar year. It is well known that the beginning of the year in different eras was in March, August, September, OctoberI
January etc. (sometimes even a variable starting point of the year was used!). So, it is not surprising to encounter errors of several years. The best solution we found has an error of 4 years.
Statement 1. There exist only two solutions for the time interval 500 B. C.-1600 A.D. First solution (medieval):
1) At midnight Greenwich time on September 9, 887 A.D., Venus covered the star 71-Virgo (the calculated distance between them is less than 1').
2) At 6.50 AM Greenwich time on January 27, 959 A.D., Mars covered the star
{3-Scorpio (the calculated distance is equal to 3').
3) At 5.15 AM Greenwich time on August 13, 994 A.D., the distance between Jupiter and the star 8-Cancer was about 20'. This distance is close to the absolute minimum of a possible distance between Jupiter and the star 8-Cancer in the time interval under the consideration.
4) At 4.50 AM Greenwich time on September 30, 1009 A.D., Saturn was at a distance equal to 50' from the star ,-Virgo (below the star).
Second solution (ancient):
1) At 7.45 PM Greenwich time on September 1, 329 B.C., Venus covered the star 71-Virgo (the calculated distance is less than 1'). ·
2) At 5.10 AM Greenwich time on January 17, 257 B.C., Mars covered the {3-Scorpio (the calculated distance is less than 1').
3) At 4.15 AM Greenwich time on September 9, 229 B.C., Jupiter was at a distance of about 15' from the star 8-Cancer. This distance is close to the absolute minimum for the distance between Jupiter and this star in the entire historical time interval.\
4) At 3.10 PM Greenwich time on September 6, 229 B.C., Saturn was at a equal to 121 for the star 1-Virgo (below the star).
-fs
For both solutions the error for the time intervals between successive observations ;i'.
(events) relative to Ptolemy's time intervals is less than or equal to 4 years. If mrJ
omit Saturn, then for the first (medieval) solution, we obtain a time error of only{? 3 years. To obtain some other (additional) solutions, we must extend the time err~r to 10 years. (This is the statement about the stability of our result). F
,(:'
All dates in Statement 1 are given in terms of the Julian calendar, with the} beginning of the year being on January l.



Dating of the Almagest 381
The "solution" of this problem which is usually suggested by chronologists of the 16-l8th centuries (we took it from the book of R.R. Newton [321]) is as follows:
1) 272 B.C. (-271), October 12. Venus "touched" the star 77-Virgo, but the distance
between Venus and the star did not exceed 15' (!).
2) 272 B.C., January 18 (or 16). Mars "touched" the star ,8-Scorpio. But actually the distance between Mars and the star was about 50' on January 18, and about 15' on January 16 (!).
3) 241 B.C., September 4. Jupiter "covered" the star 8-Cancer. But the calculation shows that the distance between Jupiter and the star at this moment was more than 25'.
4) 229 B.C., March 1. Saturn was at a distance of "2 units" (digits) from the star ,-Virgo. But (as we have discussed above) the authenticity of this observation depends of the meaning of the term "digit".
It is quite clear that this cannot be considered as a solution of the problem. We must state that the chronologists (who studied the Almagest) did not satisfy the conditions of Ptolemy. Besides, they based their "solution" not on the correspondence between the data given by Ptolemy and modern calculations, and not even on the time distances between successive observations given by Ptolemy, but on the doubtful interpretation of the names of the months which were given by Ptolemy. They also based their "solution" on astronomical characteristics (such as longitude of the sun, the time of the observation, the longitude of the planet, etc.) calculated by Ptolemy with the help of his approximate theory (he wrote that he calculated these characteristics). Consequently, all these latest calculations of Ptolemy were added by him to the ancient information about these occultations. Of course, such calculations cannot be used for independent datings of ancient observations. Besides, as we have seen from our analysis, the chronologists have totally ignored the real ancient data which were quoted by Ptolemy and which he did not calculate. These data are: the year of the occultation and the fact of the occultation itself.
Let us note that the first (medieval) solution ideally agrees with the independent dating of the star catalogue of the Almagest [312-314]. Let us recall that this dating of the star catalogue was obtained on the basis of a very detailed and consistent statistical analysis of the whole star catalogue. If we consider the Almagest as the entire scientific text (as historians do), we must consider only the first (medieval) solution as the real one. But it would be dishonest to hide the second (ancient) solution, which is at a distance of about 1200 years from the first one and whose existence can lead to further hypothethes. Note that this solution does not coincide with the traditional one. Its appearance can be explained by different reasons, e.g., by a periodicity in the effect of the occultations of stars by planets. Namely, the plane configuration of the earth and the planets changes with time in accordance with an approximately periodic law. This configuration determines such astronomical events as occultations of the stars by planets (which are visible from the earth). Thus, it is quite natural that we have found two solutions to our problem (Fig. 125).

COROLLARY. The first solution of the dating problem (see Statement 1) implies that the beginning of the era of Nabonassar (in the chronology of the Almagest) must correspond to 480-490 A.D.
3. Dating of the Lunar Eclipses
Twenty one lunar eclipses mentioned in the Almagest were observed by different astronomers approximately during the time inteval from 26 to 881 years in the of Nabonassar. Ptolemy listed the following characteristics of the eclipses:
1) The year of the eclipse in terms of some chronological era, which was given ini the ancient document used by Ptolemy. Usually, after this, Ptolemy recalculate<V this year in the era of Nabonassar. In several remaining cases, this recalculation (taf the era of Nabonassar) can be easily done on the basis of the relations between th1 different eras which are listed in the Almagest.
2) The phase of the eclipse according to the ancient document which is quoted: by Ptolemy. Let us recall that the Almagest contains the theory of the moon'~ motion. But this theory did not allow Ptolemy to calculate the phase of the eclipseli



Dating of the Almagest 383
This is the reason why Ptolemy quoted the phase from the ancient text without any comments. A more advanced theory of the moon's motion allowing to calculate the phase of lunar eclipses was created only in the 19th century A.D.
3) The date of the eclipse and the time of the "middle of the eclipse". These data are the result of Ptolemy's calculations (he mentioned this). Consequently, these "calculated data" are not of any interest for an independent dating problem.
4) The place of the observation of the eclipse. Note that any lunar eclipse is visible from half of the earth's globe. Hence, the indication of the place is not of serious significance.
Thus, only the data of 1) and 2) are really important for the dating problem, because Ptolemy did not calculate these data and simply extracted them from the ancient documents. Hence, we use the following data:
1) the year of the eclipse in terms of some chronological era (the beginning of which we assume to be unknown, but we calculate it after the solution of the dating problem); 2) the phase of the eclipse.

Let us recall that the phase of an eclipse is equal to the maximal part of the diameter of the moon which is shadowed; this part is measured in units equal to 1/12 of this diameter. For supertotal eclipses, we need to calculate the length of the earth's shadow which is crossed by the moon. The total eclipse starts from 12 units (all eclipses with a phase more than 12 units are total). Ptolemy does not mention the phase for 3 eclipses out of 21. But at each point of the earth's surface, one can observe at least one lunar eclipse a year (with some phase). Consequently, a mention of these eclipses without their phases does not bear any real astronomical information. Thus, we are forced to exclude these three eclipses and finally work

The problem of independent astronomical dating of the lunar eclipses in the Al~· magest can be stated as follows. We need to find in the past (based on the moder.· theory of the moon's motion} the set of 18 lunar eclipses which satisfy the followi conditions.
1) Each eclipse must have the phase which is given in the Almagest (with an accu: racy of 1 unit). The phases of the eclipses were determined by medieval astronome sufficiently accurately (from visual observation), and after this they have not b changed by recalculations. Thus we can assume that the phase of the lunar eclip in the Almagest is quoted correctly with an accuracy of 1 unit (because the value the phase is represented in the Almagest by an integral number of units).
2) The "inter-eclipse times" must correspond to the distances which are lis in the Almagest. But because Ptolemy used several different ancient documen ' the years of some eclipses are given relative to different eras. It is impossible demand an accuracy of better than 2 years (between eclipses). The reason is ( the discussion above) that different eras can employ a different beginning of t year. Hence, the recalculation from one era to another can produce a natural err · of 1 year. Consequently, for the difference between two dates, this error can be equ to 2 years.



Dating of the Almagest 385
We solved this numerical problem with the help of computer calculations and the modern theory of the moon's motion. We also tested our results by comparing them with the well-known Canons of eclipses [172, 177]. We considered all eclipses of the historical interval from 900 B.C. to 1600 A.D. The result obtained is as follows.
Statement 2. There exists a unique solution of the above-mentioned problem of dating of lunar eclipses in the Almagest which satisfies with an accuracy of 3 years all conditions imposed on inter-eclipse times and which have the necessary phases. This is the set of eclipses compiled in Table 4. It turned out that all these eclipses are medieval.

This unique solution is stable with respect to variations of time. Ptolemy used different ancient documents describing the lunar eclipses. These documents sometimes use different chronological eras. For example:
- the eclipses Nos. 1-3 are dated in the ancient documents (as Ptolemy says) by dates of the era of Mardokempad;
- the eclipses Nos. 4-5-by dates of the era of Nabonassar;
- the eclipses Nos. 6-7-by dates of the era of Darius;



386 Appendix 3
- the eclipses Nos. 8-9-by dates of the Athenian magistracy; - the elipses Nos. 10-12-by dates of the 3rd Callippic period; - the eclipse No. 13 is assigned to the era of Philometor; - the eclipses Nos. 15-18-by dates of the era of Hadrian.
As we can see, Ptolemy made some errors (sometimes of about 10 years) when recalculating from one era to another. This means that Ptolemy, generally speaking, does not have the exact position of the initial points for different eras. Consequently, the time distances (separation) between the eclipses which are given in terms of the same era must be considered to be more reliable in comparison with the distances between the eclipses assigned to different eras. The reason is that, in the first case, Ptolemy simply extracted the time differences from some ancient document, and consequently these values do not depend on the position of these eclipses on an absolute time scale. But in the second case, the time distances depend on Ptolemy's recalculations of dates belonging to different ancient eras for those belonging to the "era of Nabonassar". These recalculations can produce additional errors. This is the reason why we decided to continue our computer calculations to study the problem: "Are there any other solutions of our problem if we permit possible errors in time distances to increase?" We decided to leave the accuracy of 3 years for inter-eclipse times belonging to the same chronological era, and to permit the accuracy to increase up to 30 years (!) for inter-eclipse times "connecting" eclipses assigned to different eras. Remark: the eclipses assigned (in the Almagest) to the same era form some compact groups on the time axis, i.e., they are located inside sufficiently small time intervals. But distances between successive eclipses, assigned to different eras, are about tens and hundreds of years. In other words, the eclipses form some concentrations on the time axis. It is clear that each such concentration is the reflection of some homogeneous set of observations, which were made (according to the Almagest) by the same scientific school, maybe in the same place (more or less). Consequently, it is natural to think that the mutual position of the eclipses inside each "homogeneous group" must itself be more precise than the mutual position (on the time axis) of the concentrations. The location of these concentrations on a common time scale is evidently the result of more recent chronological work and recalculations.
Statement 3. Let us consider an accuracy of 3 years for inter-eclipse times for successive eclipses assigned to the same era, and an accuracy of 30 years for intereclipse times for successive eclipses assigned to different eras. Then the solution found in Statement 2 still remains unique for the entire historical time interval under consideration.
If we extended the accuracy (error) up to 4 years for all cases, then a new solution would appear with the first eclipse at 721 B.C. This solution is close to the traditional one (suggested by historians and chronologists) but does not coincide in details with traditional datings. Figure 126 shows two histograms which demonstrate the distribution of the deviation (in comparison with the Almagest) of inter-eclipse times for both solutions. It is clear that the first (medieval) solution is considerably better than the second one (ancient).

Here (as in the case of star occultations) we also have the periodicity in the lunar eclipses. The existence of the second (ancient) solution is explained by the approximate periodicity in the evolution of the configuration consisting of sun, earth, and moon. This period is equal to several hundreds years. But the periodicity has only approximate character and it follows that the second (ancient) solution is considerably worse that the first (medieval) one.
4. The Chronology of the Ahnagest
According to our dating of the star occultations by the planets, the era of Nabonassar in the Almagest starts in 470-490 A.D. More precisely, the exact dates for this starting point, obtained on the basis of different star occultations and on the basis of different versions related to the 11-year disagreement in the internal chronology of the Almagest, are as follows: 447 A.D., 481 A.D., 483 A.D., 486 A.D. The dating on the basis of the collection of lunar eclipses in the Almagest gives 465 A.D. as the first year of Nabonassar. What can we say about the accuracy of this value? The comparison of the time configuration of the eclipses in the Almagest with the real time configuration, discussed above, shows that the global chronology of the Almagest contains some errors (displacements), which have the same value as for the case of star occultations (the maximum chronological displacement is equal to 11 years). Consequently, the typical accuracy of the relative positions of the basic points for the different eras (their initial points) in the Almagest is 10-15 years. The agreement between our datings resulting from star occultations and lunar eclipses is ideal. They both lead to the same interval, i.e., 460-490 A.D., which is supposed to contain the beginning of the era of Nabonassar. Now we can reconstruct the global chronology of the Almagest. In the Almagest, Ptolemy mentions the dates (in terms of the era of Nabonassar) of the following events from the history of Assyria, Egypt, Rome:

1) The reconstructed chronology of the Almagest (Fig. 127) ideally corresponds to the dating of the star catalogue of the Almagest: 600-1300 A.D. (where the most plausible time interval of the creation of the catalogue is the 10th century A.D.). According to this chronology, the following events (mentioned in the Almagest) took place during the 9-l0th centuries A.D.: - all observations of the star occultations by the planets; - the most massive concentrations of the observations of the lunar eclipses; - starting points of the most important chronological eras such as: the era of Philadelphus, the Callippic periods, the era of Alexander, the Chaldean era, the era of Dionysius,-5 eras in all of the 11 mentioned in the Almagest. 2) The time interval for the death of Alexander (885-915 A.D., according to the reconstructed chronology of the Almagest) practically coincides with the rule of the unique emperor Alexander 912-913 A.D. in the history of Byzantium (and Western Europe). 3) The time interval for the beginning of the Callippic periods covers the starting point of the Great Indiction in 877 A.D. Let us recall that the starting points of the Great Indictions are at a distance of 532 years one from one another. This is the time period after which the combinations of medieval calendar characteristics of the year (such as indict, moon's cycle, sun's cycle) are repeated. But a shorter period was used for cycles too. It is the so-called Callippic period (cycle), which is equal to 76 years. One Great Indiction consists of an integral number of Callippic periods. Consequently, it is natural to expect that the Callippic period is simply a subdivision of the Great lndiction and, hence, the beginning of the Great Indiction must coincide with the beginning of the 1st Callippic period. It turns out that this natural conjecture is completely confirmed in the reconstructed chronology of the Almagest: the 1st Callippic period started in 877 A.D.-exactly in the year marking the beginning of the Great Indiction.



APPENDIX 4*
The Dating of the First Oecumenical Council of Nicaea and
the Beginning of the Christian Era
G. V. Nosovsky
1. A Date for the Council of Nicaea from the Easter Book
1.1. The accepted point of view. It is commonly accepted nowadays that the church calendar, used by the Orthodox Church till now, was canonized by the First Oec
umenical Council, held in the town of Nicaea in Vafin in 325 A.D., in the reign ot Emperor Constantine. The calendar consists of two parts, the flexible and the fixed • one. The fixed part is the Julian calendar (the so-called "old style") with fixed fes- ; tivals its dates. The flexible part is the Easter Book, which determines the position/
of Easter, changing from year to year, in the Julian calendar, and consequently the i.·
count of weeks and the position of flexible festivals. The two parts of the calendar:f' together determine church services for every day of the year; thus, the canonization of the calendar is of fundamental significance for the Church. This makes thei common opinion that the church calendar was canonized at the First Oecumenical Council look quite plausible. So it was thought in the Middle Ages, and so it · accepted today. Not many, however, know that this opinion sharply contradicts the present traditional dating of the Council of Nicaea to 325 A.D. (and any of the 4th century A.D.J. Meanwhile, this contradiction was already noticed by paschalists at the beginning of 20th century. However, this contradiction hitherto received no perspicuous explar nation. Note that the dating of the Council of Nicaea is of exceptional importance becau~ this date is a basis for all chronology assumed today of the events since the 4th century A.D. This date also provided a reason for the Gregorian calendar reform conducted by the Roman Church at the end of the 16th century (so-called "new style"). Thus, a revision of dating of the Council of Nicaea entails a revision of the entir chronological scale at least from the 4th to the 14th century. Apparently, this is th reason why those who noticed the contradictions between the contents of the East Book and the date of the Council of Nicaea did not decide to make any conclusions· We, however, digress for a while from these difficulties and consider the proble of dating the Council of Nicaea according to the Easter Book, leaving alone the chronology of other events.
*This Appendix contains the remarkable results of G. V. Nosovsky obtained in 1990. The sho version of this work was published in 1992 (see [347]).

The Dating of the First Oecumenical Council 391
Let us begin with several quotations from the book by I. A. Klimishin "Calendar and Chronology" , which reflects the modern point of view on the origins of the Easter Book. "The problem of "combining" lunar and solar (Julian) calendars faced Christian theologists in all its magnitude in the 2nd century A.D., when the Christian tradition of celebrating Easter began to be established ... They compiled a schedule of lunar
phases ("ages") for calendar months of 19-year cycles. In other words, a specific kind of "perpetual calendar" was framed, in which the new moons of each year were associated with concrete dates of calendar months. This schedule was used for centuries for calculating the dates of Easter as well as for dating events ..." [335, p.
74]."The schedule of new moons for a 19-year cycle, used invariably for the determination of Easter lunar phases till now, had been already framed by the 5th century A.D." [335, p. 87].
"... In the 3rd century A.D. reliable methods for calculating the dates of Easter had been already worked out ... Thus, from the 4th century A.D. on, the Christian church connected its annual cycle of festivals to the Julian calendar, and the most important of them, Easter (and it accompanying cycle of feasts and "transitional" festivals), with the lunar-solar calendar" [335, p. 214]. Thus, the modern tradition presumes that the rules for calculating the dates of Christian Easter began to be established in the 2nd century A.D. and assumed the modern form in the 4th century A.O. Moreover, all reference books assert quite definitely that the rules had been canonized at the First Oecumenical Council of Nicaea: "At the (First Oecumenical) Council it was decreed that Easter should be celebrated on the first Sunday after the first spring full moon" [God Law, Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville, N.Y., U.S.A., 1-987]. "The controversy lasted until the Oecumenical Council of Nicaea, which ... determined ... that Easter should be celebrated by Christians certainly separately from Israelites and certainly on Sunday after full moon. Appropriate calculations had been done in order to make determination of Easter for each year more precise" [Encyclopaedia of Brockhauz-Evfron, "Easter"]. "The original text of the Nicene decree of the Council of Nicaea did not survive. It was already absent in the archives of the Church of Constantinople in the early 5th century. As an official document, only the message of Emperor Constantine from Nicaea to the bishops absent at the Council is available. The message asserts that 'it appeared to the Council unbeseeming to perform the Holy Festival in the custom of Israelites'" [335, p. 212]. Nevertheless, a serious chronological problem is hidden here. Let us cite several quotations from papers of specialists dealing with the Easter Book and with chronology. "Calendars, text-books and treatises on compiling the Orthodox Easter Book contain references to the determination of the First Oecumenical Council that prescribes to celebrate Easter on the first Sunday after Passover, which in its turn is performed on the arrival of the first spring full moon. But, as is known, there is no such rule available among rules of the First Oecumenical Council. The Antiochian Council also refers to the prescript of the First Oecumenical Council ... but gives no concrete instructions for the time to celebrate Easter, as if the prescript of the First Oecumenical Council confined itself to the prohibition of celebrating Easter at the same time as the Israelites ... Russian paschalist archipriest D. Lebedev characterizes



392 Appendix 4
the requirements, usually ascribed to the Church fathers of the First Oecumenical Council and traditional for our Easter Book, as 'a later formulation of the principle of the Alexandrite Easter Book'" (337]. "The question on the time when the rule of celebrating Easter only after the spring equinox was formulated remains open" (335, p. 213]. "What did the decisions of the First Oecumenical Council on the celebrating Easter consist of? A detailed account of this problem ..." (337]. What does the difficulty of this problem consist in? The question seems clear. Although the original rule of the Council of Nicaea did not survive, it is known that the Council did determine that rule; moreover, it did it in 325 A.D., when a "reliable methods for calculating the dates of Easter had been worked out" and the schedule of Easter dates had been already compiled, which later "was used for centuries". The latter is quite natural because "every 532 years the Christian Easter recurs in the same order ... Easter tables for all 532 years were known" (336, p. 4]. Thus, calculation of a new 532-year Easter Book reduces to a mere shift of the preceding one by 532 years. This rule obtains till now: the last great indiction (as the 532-year period of the Easter Book is called) began in 1941 and is a shift of the preceding one (1409-1940) which, in its turn, can be obtained by shifting the indiction of877-1408, and that one by shifting the indiction of 345-876. Thus, the original form of the Easter Book can easily be restored. Besides, the rules lying at the basis of the Easter Book are well known from the ecclesiastical tradition. In "The Collection of Rules of the Holy Fathers of the Church" of Matthew Vlastar (Constantinople, 14th century), an account of enactments of the oecumenical and regional councils, it is said: "The rule on Easter includes two restrictions: not to celebrate together with the Israelites and to celebrate only after the spring equinox. Two more were added to them by necessity: to perform the festival after the very first full moon after the equinox, and not on any day but on the first Sunday after the full moon. All these restrictions except the last one have been kept firmly till now, but now we often change for a later Sunday. Namely, we always count two days after the Passover (i.e., the full moon-G. Nosovsky) and then turn to the following Sunday. This happened not by ignorance or inability of the Church fathers who confirmed the rules, but because of the lunar motion ..." [331; 340, part P]. That is, the Church fathers of Council, who established the Easter Book, added to the two basic (apostolic) rules, not to cocelebrate Easter with the Israelites and to celebrate it after the spring equinox, two more rules: to perform the celebration after the first spring full moon (i.e., after Passover), and not on any day but on the next Sunday. According to Vlastar, the first three of the four rules are kept strictly, but the 4th rule, demanding that the Easter Sunday should be the one following the full moon, is infringed due to the discrepancy between the Easter lunar cycle ( "circle for the moon") and the length of the Julian year; there are at least two days between the full moon and Easter (in the times of Vlastar, 14th century). This happened because of the slow (and apparently unknown to the Fathers of the Council) shift of the full moons away from the dates fixed in the "circle for the moon" (as we now
know, this shift amounts to twenty-four hours per 300 years). The fourth rule is infringed, for example, if Passover falls on a Saturday. Indeed, by the 4th rule, the Easter should fall on the next day, the Sunday. But because of ensuing two-day shift, Easter is placed by the Easter Book to be a week later, on the next Sunday. The above excerpt from "Rules" by Matthew Vlastar contains a complete set of rules the Easter Book is based on. Thus, we know much about the Easter Book,



The Dating of the First Oecumenical Council 393
i.e., almost all. What, then, is the difficulty that worries the specialists? The difficulty arises from the fact that the above data on Easter Book contradict the accepted date of the Council of Nicaea, that canonized the Easter Book. This contradiction can be easily seen from a very rough and simple calculation: if a oneday difference between Easters and the true full moons accumulates in 300 years, and by the times ofVlastar (approximately 1330) it had accumulated to 2 days, then the
Easter Book had been compiled approximately in 730 (because 1330-300 x 2 = 730), and canonized still later. This does not agree with the date of 325 A.D. Note that Matthew Vlastar himself perceives no contradiction (though he knew about "l-dayin-304-years" shift of the "circle for the moon" and could do this obvious calculation). He merely did not yet know about the dating of the Council that established the Easter Book 325 A.D.! The contradiction is so obvious that it could not be left unnoticed by researchers. It was noted in the form of seemingly strange reservations: "The fact that the Council of Nicaea passed no firm prescriptions on celebrating Easter only after the spring full moon can be seen from the history of the celebration of Easters in the first years after the Council" (i.e., passed, but not "firm" ?-G. Nosovsky). "By the way, it should be noted that in the Alexandrite lunar cycle, the 14th day of the return of the moon (i.e., full moon) always fell one or two days earlier than the real full moon" (?!-G. Nosovsky) [337]. But the new moon, and so the full moon, can be easily determined by merely looking at the sky. A systematic 2-day error in full moons looks inexplicable not only for the 4th century but even for the time of the caveman. "To determine Easters according to the rules of the Orthodox Easter Book, it is important to assure that Easter should not coincide with Passover ... The tables ... provide dates of Passovers from 900 A.D. on" (?!-G. Nosovsky) [338, p. 14]. But why from 900 A.D. only? Is it not because the coincidences in question only ceased to occur in 8th century (see below)? So, when was the Easter Book really compiled?
1.2. A date from the Easter determination rule. A computer experiment. The apostolic (i.e., the basic) rule on Easter requires that Easter should not coincide with Passover. The ecclesiastical tradition tells that Passover is the first spring full moon (see, for example, [331]). Nowadays the dates of full moons can be calculated very precisely. To that end we used the well-known Gauss formulas, with the help of which we calculated (using a computer) the Julian dates of all spring full moons from the 1st century A.D. until today and compared them with the dates of the Orthodox Easter indicated in the Easter Book. As a result we come to the following conclusion.
Statement 1. The Council that established the Easter Book (in medieval and modern tradition, the First Council of Nicaea) could not have taken place before 784 A.D., because only after this year (due to slow shift of the lunar phases) the coincidences of "calendar" Easters (i.e., the determined by the Easter Book) with the "lunar" Passovers ceased to occur. The last such coincidence occurred in 784, and since then the dates of Passovers and Easters diverged forever. Therefore, the Council of Nicaea could not have canonized the Easter Book in the 4th century A.D. when the calendar Easters coincided with Passovers 8 (!) times-in the years 316, 319, 323, 343, 347, 367, 374 and 394, and 5 times came even two days earlier (which is forbidden by the 4th rule on Easter): in the years 306, 326 (one year after the



394 Appendix 4
Council!), 346, 350 and 370.
Thus, ifwe follow the modern tradition, we find ourselves forced to accept that the very first celebration of Easter after the Council of Nicaea infringed roughly three of four rules according to which the Council established this celebration. And only 500 years after the Council, that established the Easter Book, it began to conform faultlessly to the rules that determined it! This does not look plausible. Note that Scaliger, as he compiled in 16th century the chronology hitherto accepted, could not defect this nonsense, because in his time calculation of the full moons for the distant past was an extremely difficult problem. The incongruity had been observed much later, when the Scaliger version of chronology had been already canonized and called "scientific" , and any changes in it had become intolerable.
1.3. A date from Easter full moons. The fact that, when the Easter Book was
compiled Easter was defined as the first Sunday after the first spring full moon is not only known from the ecclesiastical tradition; it ensues also from the Easter Book tables. Among them there is a table of Julian dates of Passovers (the spring full moons) for all years of the 19-year lunar cycle, the "circle for the moon". The Easter Book is based on the assumption that the dates of spring full moons punctually recur every 19 years. The date of Easter is determined as the first Sunday after such a
(calendar!) full moon. To find the date of Easter, one is to find the "circle for the moon" for the year, then to determine from the Easter table the date of the corresponding full moon and finally turn to the next Sunday. The compilers of the Easter Book regarded the schedule of spring full moons they used (the "circle for the moon" or "the Metonian cycle") as perpetual; they
canonized it and based the entire Easter Book on it. This implies at least that in their time the real "circle for the moon" was exactly as they canonized it. That they did not suspect any inaccuracy of the Metonian cycle and believed that the "circle for the moon" would ever correspond accurately to real full moons observable in the sky, is also noted by ecclesiastical tradition (Matthew Vlastar, see above). But today we know that the Metonian cycle is in fact not precise. Real spring moons shift slowly to earlier dates of the Julian calendar (the shift amounts to approximately
24 hours per 300 years). Clearly, this gives us a possibility to estimate (roughly) the date when the Easter Book was compiled: it suffices to compare the table of Easter full moons with the precise modern tables of lunar phases and to find the time interval in which the coincidence is satisfactory. Note that the modern theory enables us to calculate lunar phases for the past very precisely (within minutes), but we only need the dates of full moons, so we used the formulas of Gauss.
Statement 2. A satisfactory coincidence ( within 1 day) of Easter full moons with real astronomic full moons occurred only between 700 and 1000 A.D. Before 700, real full moons always came later than the Easter ones, and after 1000, vice versa, real full moons (i.e., Passovers) came earlier than the Easter full moons. The beginning of the 13th great indiction (in 877 year) is the time of the IDEAL coincidence ofreal and Easter full moons. Thus, the Easter Book could have been compiled between the 8th and 10th centuries, and could not have been compiled at any other time.
Consequently, if we regard the Council of Nicaea as the Council that established the Easter Book, then it had to take place in the 8-l0th centuries, most probably in the end of the 9th century (after 877). Indeed, the Council established the Easter Book for immediate usage and for usage for as long as possible without additional recalculations. Therefore, the Council had to compile the table for the whole 532



The Dating of the First Oecumenica/ Council 395
year great indiction. We see that the beginning of one of the great indictions (877) falls exactly into the interval of the most probable time of compilation of the Easter Book (when Easters and astronomical full moons coincided best). Probably, it was the Council that established the Easter Book that appointed 877 as the beginning of the great indiction. Clearly, this year could be the year of the Council or a year soon after (it would be strange to compile a 532-year table and to use it only a few dozen years later-by the way, this is what was suggested by Scaliger for the case of the Council of Nicaea: according to Scaliger, the Easter Book was established in 325, and the great indiction began 20 years later, in 345!). Remark. It is commonly accepted that the system of chronology since Adam (since the creation of the world) came into use in the 4th century, soon after the Council of Nicaea: "Two Byzantic eras ... took an important place in chronological calculations. In the first of them, the time is counted from Saturday, September 1, 5509 B.C. This era was created in the reign of Emperor Constantius (who ruled from 337 to 361) ... Since the 6th century, in Byzantium, another era "since the Creation of the World" came into use, with the epoch starting on March 1, 5508 B.C." [335, p. 238]. Apparently, in Scaliger's chronology the time when the era since Adam (since the creation of the world) came in use ''fell in the past" together with the time of the canonization of Easter Book. Probably, this era had been established together with the beginning of the great indiction (877) by counting 12 complete great indictions
to the past (876 - 532 x 12 = - 5508 = 5509 B.C.; a one-year difference comes from
the peculiarity of "historical" chronology arising at the crossing of the epoch of the era). However, this is only a conjecture, and the question of what is primary, the era since Adam or the beginning of the great indiction in 877 A.D.-requires a special investigation, which we did not carry out.
1.4. A date from the "Damaskine palm". Without a single exception, the Easter Book contains no names of its compilers. Among others, there is an Easter table that enables us to perform auxiliary calendar calculations with the help of numbers imaginarily placed along the articulations of the fingers of a palm, the "Damaskine palm". Without going to the roots of these calculations, note only that they are unnecessary if you have a ready Easter Book. The Damaskine palm is not an addition to the Easter Book but a convenient method of calculation, which could be used for elaboration of the Easter Book, but before the compilation of the final Easter tables and their canonization. The lifetime of Rev. lohann Damaskine was 673-777 (that is one of the versions; other versions do not differ too much from this), which is more than 300 years later than the date of the canonization of the Easter Book (according to Scaliger, 325 A.D.). It is impossible to understand what the device for calculating "by palm" was needed for if there were ready (and used for 300 years) Easter tables which could give without any calculation everything the "Damaskine palm" gives.
It is more natural to think that the "Damaskine palm" preceded the canonization of the Easter tables. But then the canonization could not take place before 700 A.D. (because Damaskine was born in 673). In different words, traditional (Scaliger's) date of the canonization of the Easter Book contradicts the traditional dates of Rev. lohann Damaskine's lifetime. If we admit as above that the Council of Nicaea that canonized the Easter Book took place at the end of 9th century, we lift this contradiction. Quite a natural picture arises: the Easter Book had been worked out in the 8-9th centuries (with collaboration of lohann Damaskine) and was canonized at the end of 9th century.



396 Appendix 4
1.5. An explicit date of Matthew Via.star. It is striking that the "Collection of the Holy Father's Rules" of Matthew Via.star (Constantinople, 14th century), the book referred to by all researchers of the Easter Book, contains an explicit indication of the date of the compilation of the Easter Book: after 743 A.D., and this dating remained "unnoticed" (?!) by all researchers. Still more striking is that citations of
the most frequently quoted excerpt from the book of Vlastar concerning the rules for calculating the dates of Easters break off immediately before this explicit indication. We cite here this paragraph completely: "There are four regulations concerning our Easter. The first two are contained in the apostolic rules and the other two are known from the tradition. The first regulation is to perform Easter after the spring equinox. The second is not to celebrate Easter together with the Israelites. The third-not merely after the equinox but after the first full moon after the equinox. And the fourth-not merely after the full moon but on the first Sunday after the full moon .. . Our Church fathers compiled the present Easter Book and delivered it to the Church presuming that it contradicts none of the above regulations. They compiled it in the following way:
they took consecutive years from the year 6233 since the creation of the world (==
725 A.D.-G. Nosovsky) till the year 6251 (== 743 A.D.-G. Nosovsky) and looked
when in each of them the first full moon after the spring equinox occured. It follows directly from the Easter Book that when the Fathers did this the equinox fell on March 21" [331, sheet 190; 340, p. 333).
Thus, the "circle for the moon", the basis of the Easter Book, was established from observations in the years 725-743, and so the Easter Book itself could not have been compiled (not to say canonized by a Council) before this time.
Matthew Vlastar himself has no doubt having the Church fathers established the Easter "circle for the moon" after the year 743. He already knows that astronomic full moons shift to earlier dates of the Julian calendar at the rate of 1 day in approximately 304 years, and he writes: "As we consider the 19-year cycle 304 years after the Fathers had established
it-the seventeenth, beginning in the year 6537 (= 1029 A.D.-G. Nosovsky), we see that the first spring full moons in it come one day earlier than in the first 19-year cycle ... Similarly, as we consider the 19-year cycle, which is separated from the first
one by the same distance and begins in the year 6842 (= 1333 A.D.-G. Nosovsky), we discover in it the anticipation of full moons for one additional day .. . That is why the two days are now added to Passover" [331, sheet 191; 340, part P]. As we have already shown (see Statement 2), this argument ofVlastar is confirmed completely by modern astronomic calculations: the Easter full moons indeed came on an average two days later than the real ones in 1333, one day later in 1029 and coincided with them in the second half of one 8th century when (in Vlastar's opinion, but not in the opinion of now predominant chronological school) they were compiled.
1.6. Comparison of the dates. Thus, we obtain that the Easter Book was compiled not before 784 (by the essence of the determination of Easters); not before 700 (by the coincidence of Easters and astronomic full moons); not before 700 (by the "Damaskine palm"); not before 743 (by Matthew Vlastar and hence by all Orthodox Byzantine tradition). Therefore, the Easter Book had been first compiled not before the second half of the 8th century (but not in the 2nd-5th centuries, as Scaliger's tradition tries to make us believe).



The Dating of the First Oecumenical Council 397
1. 7. The "first and second" Oecumenical Council. Canonization of the Easter Book. It is known, however, that the Easter Book was not canonized by the Church Council as soon as it had been compiled (and this is quite natural). Consequently, the complete Easter tables for 532 years (the great indiction) were not compiled at once. It is likely that the tables were piled right at the Council which canonized the Easter Book, or on the instructions of the Council. The same Council had to appoint the beginning of the great indiction, the year that began the first complete 532-year table. Since the Easter Book was not compiled before the 8th century, this could have been only the year 877 (the beginning of the 13th indiction; the beginning of the next, 14th indiction falls already into the year 1409).
A natural question arises: Could the date of the Council that canonized the Easter Book be near 877? If it is so, then all contradictions are eliminated and everything becomes quite natural: compilation of the Easter Book in the second half of the 8th century and the establishment of the great indiction at the end of 9th century. Specialists think just the same: the Easter Book had been compiled approximately 100 years before its canonization [335, 337].
877 A.D. is in the middle of the reign of Basil I Macaedonian (867-886), the
founder of a new (Greek) dynasty in Byzantium. It was under Basil I that the so-called first and second (!) Oecumenical Council was held which, in particular, discussed the questions of chronology (!) and of ordering (canonization?) of the Church Books [331, sheet 12; 4].
Hypothesis. This is probably the point where medieval chronologists got confused. The fact is that the "first and second" Oecumenical Council was placed by Matthew Vlastar (i.e., by Constantinople tradition of the 14th century) as the last one in the rank of Oecumenical Councils, after the 7th. This is, probably, the result of a chronological mistake made in the 12-14th centuries, when attempts were made in Byzantium to date Oecumenical Councils. The "first and second" Oecumenical Council (two Councils constituting one because of a break) was placed correctly to the end of 9th century, and the 3rd to 7th Councils were attributed to dates too far in the past. As a result, the first and second Council appeared once more in the beginning (now as two separate Councils divided by 52 years). In the 16th century, Scaliger and his collaborators did not understand the essence of the matter and attributed the canonization of the Easter Book, carried out ecclesiastical tradition by the 1st Oecumenical Council not to the 9th century but to the 4th century, where they placed the 1st Oecumenical Council, leaving its "original", i.e., the "first and second" Council, in the 9th century. Remark. Note that "Collection of the Holy Father's Rules" by Matthew Vlastar, which reflects Orthodox tradition of the 14th century, gives no explicit dates before the 8th century A.D. No dates of Oecumenical or local Councils are indicated in this book. It contains only some indications of time intervals between some of the Councils, of the durations of reigns of some of the emperors and of the positions of years of Councils with respect to the beginnings of the reigns of emperors. All these uncoordinated chronological data are insufficient for constructing a continuous chronological scale. There is an impression that the work on the compilation of global chronology had begun, but was never finished (apparently, some contradictions arose, and the work reached a deadlock). However, 200 years later this incomplete chronological scheme was taken as a basis by Scaliger, evidently without any analysis, and was brought by him to absolutely precise dates (year, month, day, sometimes the hour!) of all principal events of human history. This Scaliger



398 Appendix 4
chronology is commonly accepted in modern historical science. However, modern text-books contain, as a rule, only the Scaliger-Petavius years of events (and omit months, days and hours) and do not mention that almost all these dates had been calculated in the 16-17th centuries. Below (in Sec. 3) we suggest a possible reconstruction of Scaliger's "method" that enabled him to mount the main landmarks of contemporary chronology.
1.8. The Gregorian calendar reform. Above we spoke only about the Julian calendar used in Orthodox Easter Book. This Easter Book was common for all Christians till the 16th century. But at the end of the 16th century the Roman Church changed to a new calendar, which was called Gregorian because it was introduced under Pope Gregory XIII. The Gregorian calendar is now adopted as a secular calendar (the so-called "new style"). After the adoption of the new calendar in the West, orthodox believers and catholics began to celebrate Easter on different days. The Gregorian reform of the calendar was carried out on the basis of the project of the Italian "physician and mathematician" Luigi Lilio. "In a special bull Inter gravissimas of February 24, 1582, the Pope says the following: 'Our care was not only to reinstate the equinox in its long ago nominated place from which it has deviated since the Council of Nicaea approximately by ten days, and to return the 14th moon (ecclesiastical notation of full moon-G. Nosovsky) to its place, from which it has deviated by four and five days, but also to settle such modes and rules according to which future equinoxes and the 14th moon would never move off their places ... Therefore, in order to return the equinox to its proper place established by the Church fathers of the Council of Nicaea on the 12th day before the April calends (March 21), we prescribe and enjoin concerning October of the current year, 1582, that ten days, from the third day before nonas (October 5) to the eve of the ides (October 14) inclusive, be deleted'. Thus the spring equinox was moved to March 21, "to its place". And in order to prevent further accumulation of the error, it was decided to delete 3 days every 400 years" (335, p. 216). The text of the bull makes a strange impression. It contains two errors of astronomical nature: first, the difference between Easters and the true (astronomic) full moons that had accumulated by the end of the 16th century was determined incorrectly; second, a wittingly unsolvable problem to correct the calendar in such a way that "equinox and the 14th moon would never move off their places" was raised. This problem is unsolvable because the date of the spring equinox and the cycle of full moons (14th moon) shift at different rates, so it is impossible to stop both of them. And indeed, though due to the Gregorian reform the date of the equinox became almost fixed, the 14th moon began to shift one and half times faster, though in the opposite direction (forward in the calendar). See Fig. 128. Note that neither of these errors could have been made by a skilled mathematician of the 16th century. Perhaps, L. Lilio was only a physician? In his bull, the pope expresses confidence in the fact that in the time of the Council of Nicaea (i.e., the First Oecumenical Council) the equinox fell on March 21. Where is this known from? Indeed, "the original text of the Nicene decree did not survive. It was already absent in the archives of the Church of Constantinople in the early 5th century" (331, sheet 212). Evidently, this is a conclusion from the text of the Easter Book itself. Indeed, according to the Easter Book, the earliest Easter falls on March 22, and the earliest spring full moon (Passover) on March 21. Consequently, according to the rules for Easter the Church fathers who established the Easter Book had to presume that the spring equinox (in their'time) occurred not later than

March 21. Apparently, this was the reason for the traditional conclusion that the Church fathers of the Council of Nicaea assumed that the equinox fell exactly on March 21. A similar conclusion was drawn by Matthew Vlastar [331, sheet 190]. But, first, such a conclusion, strictly speaking, does not ensue from the Easter Book; we only can imply that the Church fathers of the Council who established the Easter Book assumed the spring equinox to occur no later than March 21. Second, the date of the spring equinox presumed by the Church fathers could differ from the date of the true (astronomic) equinox! There is nothing surprising about that; for example, even in the 14th century, Matthew Vlastar determined the contemporary spring
equinox with a 6-day (!) error. The spring equinox is an astronomic event not so easy to determine. An exact determination of it requires special astronomic equipment and (in Middle Ages) long-time observations. Thus, there is nothing surprising about the fact that it was not determined quite accurately even in late Middle Ages. The problem is that an inaccurately determined date of the spring equinox used for dating its determination brings about an error amounting to hundreds and even thousands of years.
Apparently, we come across an example of such dating in the case of Scaliger's (nowadays accepted) dating of the First Oecumenical Council, which established the Easter Book, to the 4th century A.D. The following considerations could lie at the basis of this dating.
1) The earliest Easter falls on March 22, hence the Church fathers of the First Oecumenical Council assumed the spring equinox to fall on March 21 {this is the way Matthew Vlastar could reason). 2) The true (astronomic) spring equinox fell on March 21 in the 3rd and 4th



400 Appendix 4
centuries, therefore this was the time of the First Oecumenical Council. This was apparently, the way the chronologists of the 16th century (Scaliger) reasoned. But while the first of these considerations is doubtful (it does not ensue directly from the Easter Book), the second is erroneous because it presupposes that the Fathers of the Council of Nicaea had at their disposal an exact date (in the 4th century) for the spring equinox, while in the 14th century this date was sometimes determined with a 6-day error.
1. 9. Where the date for the Council of Nicaea came from. The date of the Council of Nicaea we derive above from the Easter Book differs essentially from the traditionally accepted one. In this connection it is useful to retrace the way the tradition to assign the Council of Nicaea to 4th century A.D. was established. Recall that the acts of the Council of Nicaea did not survive, and no available acts of the posterior Councils contain the dates they were held at. Thus, dating the Oecumenical Councils is far from easy. We begin our review of dating the Council of Nicaea with a quotation from the chronological introduction to the "Rules" by Matthew Vlastar (Constantinople; 14th century A.D.): "On the First Oecumenical Council of Nicaea. The First Oecumenical Holy Council of 318 Church fathers gathered in Nicaea, in Vafin, in the year 20 of the reign of Constantine the Great. As many years had passed since the human incarnation of our Lord, apparently, as there were Church fathers at the Council, that is, 318" [331, sheet 6]. Matthew Vlastar writes that since the human incarnation of Christ (i.e., since the birth of Christ) as many years had passed, as there were Church fathers present at the Council, that is, 318. This "method of dating" (Vlastar does not particularly insist on it) could seem insubstantial to the modern reader. We should not, however, be too supercilious about Vlastar's dating because this very date is at the basis of the modern "scientific" dating the Council of Nicaea. After the 14th century this date only got a slight specification (correction). First, a 7-year correction was done (Scaliger, 16th century): "The First Oecumenical Coucil was the Nicaean one gathered after an order of tzar Constantine the Great in Nicaea in Vafin on May 20 of the Christian year 325. 318 bishops were present there ..." [334, sheet 183]. The second correction amounted to several weeks (20th century, Encyclopaedia of Brockhaus-Evfron, "Council of Nicaea"): "On July 4 or 5, the Emperor arrived at Nicaea (325 A.D. is meant-G. Nosovsky) and the next day the inauguration of the Council took place in the grand hall of the emperor's palace ... The Council decided the question of the time of celebrating Easter ..." Not dwelling on the analysis of these specifications, let us ask a question: On what did the founder of the "scientific" chronology, I. Scaliger, base his confirmation of the "rough" dating the Council of Nicaea to 4th century A.D.? Recall that the activities
of I. Scaliger were at the time of the Gregorian calendar reform. We have already-'
observed that the reform leaned heavily upon the conviction that the Council o' ·
Nicaea had canonized the Easter Book just in the 4th century A.D. This assignment• to the 4th century conformed to the astronomical analysis (rather superficial) of the
contents of the Easter Book (a more thorough analysis refutes this assignment, see , subsection 8). Evidently, this conviction was shared by Scaliger. But this means· that his dating the Council of Nicaea (or, at least, the "scientific" part of this dating},



The Dating of the First Oecumenical Council 401
is based on the date of compilation of the Easter Book.
Conclusion. "As a rough approximation" contemporary dating of the Council of Nicaea existed as an "insufficiently well-founded hypothesis" in the 14th century already. Its "scientific" grounds are connected with the astronomic contents of the Easter Book. Therefore, today's traditional "scientific" dating of the Council of Nicaea is a dating from the Easter Book. This dating is based on an insufliciently thorough analysis of the matter.
1.10. The main conclusions. Thus, we have shown that:
1) The Easter Book, based on events of astronomic nature, "contains" the date of its compilation (that is, it admits independent dating); 2) This date is later than is usually assumed: it is at least a few centuries later than 325 A.D.; 3) This very date, not the now accepted in Scaliger's chronology, was known in Constantinople in the 14th century and, consequently, is a part of the Orthodox tradition.
2. The Birth of Christ and 1 A.D.
2.1. History of the problem. It is well known that no continuous count of the years
was done from the first year A.D. till nowadays. The first year of the Christian era was calculated much later than the year of the birth of Christ. It is considered that
the Roman monk Dionysius Exiguus (= the Little) was the first who calculated this year in the 6th century, more than 500 years after the event he dated. Moreover, Dionysius first calculated the date of the First Easter (the resurrection of Christ), and then used the legend according to which Christ was crucified on the 31st year since his incarnation. The date of the First Easter, according to Dionysius, falls on March 25, 5539 since Adam, and the year of the birth of Christ, consequently, is 5508 since Adam (in the Byzantine era; all other eras "since the creation of the world" appeared later, when the era "since the birth of Christ" had been already commonly accepted). The calculations of Dionysius gave rise to doubts in the West up to the 15th century, and they were never considered canonical in Byzantium. "This era (of Dionysius) was approved in 607 A.D. by Pope Boniface IV, and it appears also in documents of Pope John XII (965-972). But since the time of Pope Eugeny IV (1431), the era "since the birth of Christ" is used regularly in documents of the popes' chancellery ... The discussion on the date of the birth of Christ continued i:O: Constantinople right up to the 14th century" [335, p. 250]. Moreover, today we know that the calculations of Dionysius are in fact incorrect (because of the insufficient development of astronomy in that time). Its incorrectness was already known in the 16th-17th centuries, and since then several attempts were made to recalculate after Dionysius and to correct the dates of the birth of Christ and of the First Easter. For example, one can read in a chronograph of the end of the 17th century: "There are many (more than 40) opinions concerning the year when Christ was born" [334, sheet 102]. Let us list some of the attempts "to correct Dionysius": - Christ was resurrected on April 3, 33 A.D., on the 35th year of his life [334, sheet 109];



402 Appendix 4
- Christ was resurrected on April 5, 33 A.D., on the 34th year of his life (this is the most popular opinion today; it appeared in the 19th or 20th century); - Christ was resurrected on April 9, 30 A.D., and was born a few years before 1 A.D. (the modern point of view of the Roman Church, see also [339]). But why does one obtain different dates when trying to correct the calculations of Dionysius? Dionysius obtained his date of the First Easter as the date that satisfies certain "First Easter conditions". These conditions are also known today (see below). Let us recalculate after Dionysius, using modern data of astronomy, to obtain a definite result. Where do the different results come from? The matter is that none of the solutions mentioned above satisfies the "First Easter conditions" of Dionysius. Moreover, there are no dates near 1 A.D. (within
100 years) that satisfy the "First Easter conditions" of Dionysius. It means that if Dionysius had known modern astronomy, he would not decide to place the date of the birth of Christ where he had placed it, at 1st century A.D. (he would have placed this date not before the 5th century A.D., see below). Unfortunately, when astronomical data sufficient for understanding this had accumulated (which happened not until the 18th century), "our era" ("new era") and the date of "the birth of Christ" were already popular in the West and canonized by the Roman Church, and later also by the Orthodox Church. Besides, the date of the birth of Christ is closely connected to the chronological scale of Scaliger (and this, probably, is the main), and a large shift of this date ruins all chronological constructions of Scaliger (in other words, "it contradicts modern traditional chronology"). Therefore, the researchers who tried to "correct" Dionysius had very little freedom, as they could alter the date of the birth of Christ only by as much as a few years (and only back, in order not to increase the 3-4-year gap in Scaliger's chronology between the date of the birth of Christ and the dates of reign of August and Herod, see, for example, [335, p. 244]). Consequently, they were forced to ignore some of the conditions used by Dionysius, and also to resort to strained interpretations in order to obtain the date close to 1 A.D.
2.2. The "First Easter conditions". Ecclesiastical tradition, in accordance with the New Testament, tells that Christ was resurrected on March 25 on Sunday, on the next day after Passover, which, therefore, fell in that time on March 24 (Saturday). These are exactly the conditions used by Dionisius in his calculation of the date of the First Easter. It is absolutely clear from The Gospel according to St. John of the New Testament that Christ was resurrected on the following day Passover. It is clear from the ecclesiastical tradition that Christ was resurrected on March 25. We saw that the calculations of Dionysius the Little were based on the assumption that the First Easter fell on March 25. It is known that all eastern ecclesiastical
writers unanimously affirmed that Christ was resurrected on March 25 (see, for example, [335]). A complete list of calendar conditions that accompanied, according to the tradition, the resurrection of Christ can be found in "Collection of the Church Father's Rules" by Matthew Vlastar (14th century): "And God suffered for the sake of our salvation in 5539, when the "circle of the sun" was 23, the "circle of the moon" was 10, and Passover fell on Saturday (as the evangelists write), March 24. On the next day to this Saturday, on Sunday, March 25, Christ was resurrected. The legitimate Passover is celebrated on the equinox on



The Dating of the First Oecumenica/ Council 403
the 14th moon (i.e., on the full moon), from March 21 till April 18. As for Easter, it is celebrated on the Sunday following Passover" [331, sheet 185). The year of Christ's crucifixion Matthew Vlastar indicates (5539 since Adam) is the year calculated by Dionysius. Substracting 31 year, the time of the earthly life of Christ, Dionysius obtained the beginning of the era (1 A.D.), i.e., the year 5508 since Adam. Moreover, Matthew Vlastar gives the following calendar conditions for the First Easter: (1) Circle of the sun 23, (2) Circle of the moon 10, (3) On the eve, on March 24, there was Passover, which is celebrated on the day of 14th moon (i.e., full moon), (4) Passover fell on Saturday, but Christ was resurrected on Sunday. Is it possible to calculate the year of the First Easter from these data? The answer is: yes.
2.3. A date for the First Easter from the complete set of the First Easter conditions. We have carried out the calculations for all years in the interval 100 B.C.-1700 A.D. The days of the spring full moons (the 14th moons, or Passovers) were calculated by the Gauss formulas (using a computer), and Easters, circles for Sun and circles for moon are from the Easter Book. Like Dionysius (and Matthew Vlastar), we assumed that the day of the First Easter is an Easter day according to the Easter Book.
Statement 3. The First Easter conditions (1)-(4), associated by the ecclesiastical tradition of the 14th century with the date of the crucifixion and the resurrection of Christ, were satisfied in the interval 100 B.C.-1700 A.D. ONLY ONCE: in 1095 A.D.
Remark 1. The date (1095 A.D.) fits ideally the non-Scaliger chronology constructed in the papers of A. T. Fomenko [21), [318). Comparing it with the date of the First Oecumenical Council in Sec. 1, we see that the First Oecumenical Council could have taken place before the incarnation of Christ. Does this contradict the ecclesiastical tradition? This question turned out to be far from easy. We have found no such contradiction. The fact of the precedence of the First Oecumenical Council (i.e., the establishment of the Orthodox Church) to the birth of Christ contradicts only the point of view on the history of the Church which formed not before the 14-15th centuries, and was canonized in the West only in the 16th century.
Remark 2. The above excerpt from Matthew Vlastar that dates the First Easter, and the First Easter conditions show that we should regard very cautiously the ancient dates contained in medieval sources (and mechanically rewritten, owing to the Scaliger school, into modern textbooks). Many of these dates are results of calculations based on a still insufficiently developed science and can contain errors amounting to many centuries. It is exactly these enormous errors, but not an inaccuracy of several years, that come from the calendar calculations based on inexact medieval astronomy. For example, in the above excerpt from Matthew Vlastar, the date (5539 since Adam) and its calendar characteristic (First Easter conditions) are given. This date was obtained by medieval chronologists (by Dionysius ?) from its characteristic in accordance with the level of the chronologist's knowledge. Today, accurate calculations show that this date is erroneous in at least 1000 years! But fortunately, here we have the conditions that enable us to reestablish the date. In case such conditions are not available, it is already impossible to check such a date as well as to admit, without an additional research, that the date is precise (even



404 Appendix 4
approximately). This means that the now accepted Scaliger's chronology based on non-critical usage of sources and requires an accurate examination by the methods of modern science. This work has been done by A. T. Fomenko, who constructed the "optimal statistical chronology" of the ancient and medieval world. The present work confirms the conclusions of A. T. Fomenko [21], [318].
2.4. Dates for the First Easter from the reduced set of the First Easter conditions. Let us look more closely at the First Easter conditions (1)-(4). They are not all equivalent. The conditions (3) and (4) are known from many sources and constitute a stable tradition (see quotations, for example, in [335]). The conditions (1) and (2) look like specific calendar instructions. What can we obtain if we try to satisfy only the conditions (3) and (4)?
Statement 4. The First Easter conditions (3) and (4) are satisfied only in the following years in the interval 100 B.C.-1700 A.D.: 1) 43 B.C., 2) 53 A.D., 3) 137 A.D., 4) 479 A.D., 5) 574 A.D., 6) 658 A.D., 7) 753 A.D., 8) 848 A.D., 9) 1095 A.D. (satisfies the entire set of conditions (1)-(4)), 10) 1190 A.D.
One can easily see that this list contains no solution satisfying the chronologists of the Scaliger school. Thus, we can make the following conclusion. The popular legend (tradition), clearly reflected in the Gospel according to St. John (the first three Gospels in the New Testament mention the First Easter conditions quite vaguely; the Gospel according to St. John does not admit different interpretations) and in the works of numerous ecclesiastical writers, can not be conformed with the date of the birth of Christ near 1 A.D. In order to obtain such a concordance, it is necessary to move the date of the birth of Christ back by not less than 70 years or forward by not less than 20 years.
2.5. On the lifetime of Dionysius Exiguus. It is supposed that Dionysius the Little have lived in the 6th century and made his calculations in the following way: "There exists a conjecture [173] that Dionysius, as he composed his era, took into account the legend that Christ had died in the 31st year of his life and was resurrected on March 25 ... The year 279 of the Diocletian era (563 A.D.) was the nearest when, according to Dionysius, the Easter fell on March 25 again. Comparing his calculations with the New Testament, Dionysius could suggest that ... the First Easter had been celebrated 532 years before the year 279 of the Diocletian era ... that is, that the year 279 of the Diocletian era is the same as the year 563 from the birth of Christ" [335, p. 242]. Dionysius supposedly conducted all these arguments and calculations working with the Easter Book. Having discovered that in the contemporary year 563 (the year 279 of the Diocletian era) the First Easter conditions held, he made a 532year shift back (the duration of the great indiction, the shift after which the Easter Book entirely recurs) and got the date for the First Easter. But he did not know



The Dating of the First Oecumenica/ Council 405
that Passover (the 14th moon) could not be shifted by 532 years (because of the inaccuracy of the Metonian cycle) and made a mistake:
"Dionysius failed, though he did not know that. Indeed, if he really supposed that the First Easter fell on March 25, 31 A.D., then he made a rough mistake as he extrapolated the inaccurate Metonian cycle to 28 previous cycles (that is, for 532
years: 28 x 19 = 532). In fact, Nisan 15, the Passover festival, in the year 31 fell not
on Saturday, March 24, but on Tuesday, March 27!" [335, p. 243).
That is a modern reconstruction of what Dionysius the Little did in the 6th century. It would be all right, but it presupposes that near Dionysius' date of
563 A.D. the 14th moon (Passover) really fell on March 24. It could be that Dionysius was not aware of the inaccuracy of the Metonian cycle and made the mistake shifting Passover from 563 to the same day of March in 31 A.D. But he could not have been unaware of the date of Passover in the the almost contemporary year 563! To that end it was sufficient to apply the Metonian cycle to the coming 30-40 years; the inaccuracy of the Metonian cycle does not show up for such intervals. But in 563 Passover (the 14th moon) fell not on March 24, but on Sunday, March 25, that is, it coincided with Easter as determined by the Easter Book. As he specially worked with the calendar situation of almost contemporary year 563 and as he based his calculation of the era "since the birth of Christ" on this situation, Dionysius could not help seeing that, first, the calendar situation in the year 563 did not conform to the Gospels' description and, second, that the coincidence of Easter with Passover in 563 contradicts the essence of the determination of Easter the Easter Book is based on (see above Sec. 1).
Therefore, it appears absolutely incredible that the calculations of the First Easter and of the Birth of Christ had been carried out in the 6th century on the basis of the calendar situation of the year 563. It was shown in Sec. 1 that the Easter Book, used by Dionysius, had not been compiled before the 8th century and had been canonized only at the end of the 9th century. Therefore, the calculations carried out by (or ascribed to) Dionysius the Little had not been carried out before the 10th century.
Hypothesis. We have already seen (in Sec. 1) that it is told in the "Church Fathers'
Rules" of Matthew Vlastar that the equinox "this time" fell on March 18. In fact, the spring equinoxes in Vlastar's time fell on March 12, and they fell on March 18 in the 6th century. Therefore, if we date Vlastar's text by the equinox, we get the 6th century. Apparently, the same late medieval text was included both in the "Rules" of Matthew Vlastar and (in Latin transcription) in the treatise of Dionysius the Little. Probably, the text was written by Vlastar himself or by one of his predecessors
in the 12-14th centuries. It contains, as we saw, the dating of the resurrection of Christ, but not a single word on the date of the birth of Christ. Probably, exactly this text of Vlastar was soon thereafter used by Dionysius the Little, who subtracted 31 years from the date of Christ's resurrection, thus obtaining the date of the "birth of Christ", and introducing new era. If that had happened in the 14th century, this is an explanation why the systematic usage of this era in the West began only in the 15th century (the year 1431). Later (apparently in the 17th century), Dionysius' Latin text was dated by the equinox to the 6th century, and the aforecited reconstruction of his calculations appeared. The name "Dionysius the Little" is, apparently, merely the name of the 17th-century chronologist Dionysius Petavius
(Petavius = the Little), who concluded the construction of Scaliger's chronology
(this has been already noted by A. T. Fomenko [21)).



406 Appendix 4
3. On Modern Tradition
3.1. The extremity of modern dating ("the more ancient the better"). In Sec. 1 and Sec. 2 we_ have shown that Scaliger's dating of two epochal events of antique and medieval history (the global chronology of antiquity and the Middle Ages is based to a considerable extent on these two events), the birth of Christ and the First Oecumenical Council, contradicts the data on these events available from the ecclesiastical tradition. Let us stress once more that these data are primary, but not the dates we got used to today. These two reached us "from the depth of centuries", and all the dates of ancient, antique and early medieval history we "know" today are the result of calculations which began, apparently, not before the 13th century, were accomplished in the 17th century (Dionysius Petavius) and canonized in general at the Council of Trent of the Roman Church at the end of the 16th century (1545-47, 1551-52, 1562-63). It is important to note that the Council of Trent canonized the result of incomplete chronological work. Scaliger's chronology, which is commonly accepted now and therefore seems the only one possible and ever known, was in the 16th century, when it was canonized, only one of several possible versions of global chronology (see, for
example, [21]). It is even possible that Scaliger's chronology was the most widely spread version among the scientists of Rome and Western Europe, but this does not mean that it was true, even though roughly. It is rather doubtful that a true view of the general chronology of human history could come from medieval calculations at all. Modern investigations show that the reconstruction of general chronology from the set of available historical sources is a very complicated scientific problem, which requires application of modern scientific methods and extensive computer calculations. Unfortunately, the methods of modern chronologists remain for the most part similar to those available at the times of Scaliger and Petavius. It is interesting to note a particular feature of Scaliger's (and not only Scaliger's) dates: almost all of them follow the rule "the more ancient the better": when calculating the date of an event, of all admissible dates (the set of solutions), the earliest was chosen. It looks like the rule is still in force nowadays. We will demonstrate its effect on the accepted dates of the birth of Christ and of the First Oecumenical Council. Imagine a chronologist of the 16th century who dates these events using their description (see Sec. 1, Sec. 2). What simplest lower boundaries did he have available? In different words, what were the most earliest dates he could use? Recall that in the description of both events, the birth of Christ and the First Oecumenical Council, the day of the equinox (spring point) occurs, the rate of its shift along the dates of the Julian calendar was already known well in the 16th century. The value of this rate was widely used by chronologists (by Scaliger among them). In case of dating the birth of Christ, a chronologist of the 16th century knew that in the year of this event (and of the First Easter) the spring equinox fell on March 24 (that is, to the eve of Sunday: according to the Gospel, that day was Passover); consequently, the spring point could not come later than on March 24. The spring point fell on March 24 about the year 100 B.C., and before this year it fell on earlier days in March. Hence, our imaginary chronologist could not assign the birth of Christ to an earlier date than 100 B.C. The date a real chronologist fixed was only a hundred years short, but he had to ensure that the rest of the conditions should also be satisfied! Indeed, he used the Easter Book in his calculations (recall that the year 31 B.C. he points out satisfies the First Easter conditions only if the full moons, the

Passovers, are calculated from the Orthodox Easter Book). But according to the Easter Book, Passovers fell on Saturday, March 24, and Easters on Sunday, March 25 in the years: ... 209 B.C., 31 A.D., 126 A.D., 221 A.D., 316 A.D., ... He could not admit 209 B.C. as the date of the birth of Christ because the equinox that year fell on March 25. The earliest admissible date was 31 A.D., and this date was chosen! (see Fig. 129). In dating the First Oecumenical Council, the chronologist knew that in the time of the Council the spring point fell not later than on March 21 (otherwise the Easter Book in which the earliest Easter fell on March 22 could not have been compiled because Easter comes at least one day later than the spring equinox-see Sec. 1). The spring point fell on March 21 at the end of 3rd century, and before this time the spring point occurred later. Hence a chronologist of the 16th century could not assign the Council of Nicaea to an earlier date than the end of the 3rd century (and he assigned it to the beginning of the 4th century)-see Fig. 130. Thus, we get
Statement 5. The chronologists of the 15-17th centuries could not move the date of the First Oecumenical Council further back than to the 4th century A.D. because in the 3rd century and earlier, the spring equinoxes came before the earliest calendar Easters on March 22 (which is forbidden by the apostolic Easter rule).
Dionysius the Little could not assign the birth of Christ to a date before 1st century B.C. because in the 2nd century B.C. and earlier, the position of the spring equinoxes ruled out the Passovers on March 24, which contradicted the "First Easter condition". In both cases these easily calculable lower boundaries for the dates were almost reached by the chronologists.
Remark. Let us stress once more that determination of dates from spring equinoxes is a very attractive method of dating only at first sight because of the extreme

simplicity of the calculations (involving a single arithmetic operation). Probably, the chronologists of the 15-17th centuries confined themselves to this method (where it was possible) and conducted no further investigations. Perhaps, had they been more attentive, we would now have a different chronology.
3.2. Matthew Vlastar's equinoxes and modern chronological tradition. We have already mentioned that the "Collection of the Church Fathers' Rules" of Matthew Vlastar contains an inaccurate theory of the spring equinox; Vlastar assumes that the equinox shifts at the rate of 1 day per 300 years, while the true rate of the shift amounts to 1 day per approximately 128 years (in the Julian calendar). Besides, Vlastar also uses a wrong date for the contemporary equinox: March 18 instead of March 12 (the spring equinox in the beginning of the 14th century fell on March 12). But the chronology in Vlastar's book is based on the dates of equinoxes alone: Vlastar often does not cite direct dates but only gives the date of the spring equinox contemporary to the event and gives separately a table of spring equinoxes in years since Adam (since the creation of the world). Here is his table: 4156 (1351 B.C.) - March 27, Alexandrite noon; 4456 (1051 B.C.) - March 26; 4756 (751 B.C.) - March 25; 5056 (451 B.C.) - March 23 (in fact the equinox fell at the time on March 24); 5656 (148 A.O.) - March 22 (true: March 21); 5956 (448 A.O.) - March 21 (true: March 19); 6256 (748 A.O.) - March 20 (true: March 17); 6556 (1048 A.O.) - March 19 (true: March 14); 6856 (1348 A.O.) - March 18 (true: March 12).



The Dating of the First Oecumenica/ Council 409
Further Matthew Vlastar writes that "in the years of Nabonassar the equinox fell on the evening of March 25, but in the years of Philipp Aripheus it fell on midday of March 24, and in the days when Christ mortified Death by his death, the equinox fell on midnight of March 23. And when the Church fathers compiled the Easter Book, the equinox fell on March 21. And now it falls on March 18" [331, sheet 192; see also 340]. Thus, Matthew Vlastar gives five principal chronological landmarks of history according to his scale of equinoxes: 1) The reign of Nabonassar, ruler of Assyria; it is considered that "the era of Nabonassar began in 747 B.C." [335]. (Probably, the reign of Nabopolassar, which belongs to the end of the 7th century B.C., is meant). 2) The reign of Philipp Aripheus (the epoch of Alexander Macaedonian, which belongs, according to Scaliger, in the middle of the 4th century B.C.). 3) The time of crucifixion of Christ (the First Easter). 4) The time of the compilation of the Easter Book (traditionally, at the First Oecumenical Council, although Vlastar does not assert that definitively). 5) The time of Matthew Vlastar himself, the first half of the 14th century (1333 A.D.). If we now turn to the table of equinoxes adduced in Vlastar's book and consider when, according to this table (i.e., to the opinion of Vlastar), the equinox fell on the days ascribed to the events 1)-5), then we obtain: 1) Nabonassar (equinox on March 25): 900 B.C.-600 B.C. 2) Philipp Aripheus (equinox on March 24): 600 B.C.-300 B.C. 3) Crucifixion of Christ (equinox on March 23): 300 B.C.-1 A.D. (i.e., the beginning of the new era). 4) The First Oecumenical Council (the compilation of the Easter Book) (equinox
on March 21): 300 A.D.---u00 A.D. 5) Matthew Vlastar (equinox on March 18): 1200 A.D.-1500 A.D. Let us note at once a good accordance with modern (Scaliger's) tradition: all of Scaliger's dates are within the indicated (by Vlastar) time intervals, except the date of crucifixion of Christ; according to Scaliger, the latter must be set for about 30 A.D., and Vlastar's table of equinoxes gives the upper bound about at 1 A.D. On the other hand, the equinox chronology of Matthew Vlastar was not only based on the totally wrong theory of the equinoxes but also contradicted all explicit dates he cited, with the only exception of the dates of his own life. Vlastar gives explicit dates only for three of the five aforementioned events: For the year of crucifixion of Christ: 5539 since Adam, i.e., 31 A.D.; For the time of the compilation of the Easter Book: after 743 A.D. (see Sec. 1, subsec. 5); For his own time: 6441 since Adam, i.e., 1333 A.D. But, according to his own table, the crucifixion of Christ could not happen after 1 A.D., and compilation of the Easter Book could not be done later than 600 A.D. And only his own time is indicated by Vlastar without a contradiction. We have the result of a clearly unfinished work on compiling a chronology, in
which even the most obvious contradictions were not eliminated. It is clear that the work was really being carried out in Constantinople in the 14th century, but it was still very far from being finished and canonized. Neither the date for the birth of Christ nor other dates of ecclesiastical history were ever canonized by Orthodox Church in Byzantium. It is clear today that this was a reflection of the sober view of the contemporary state of chronology. But private persons could have their own

The DatinK of the First Oecumenica/ Council 411
opinions of chronology, not always free, as we saw in the case of Matthew Vlastar, of contradictions. I. A. Klimishin writes: "As for the Eastern Church, it, by evidence of E. Bickermann, avoided using it (the era since the birth of Christ) because the controversy concerning the date of the birth of Christ continued in Constantinople till the 14th century. But probably there were some exceptions. Thus, in the table of Easter dates, compiled in the 9th century for the whole of the 13th indiction (877-1408) by Johann Presbyter, the years since the birth of Christ were indicated together with the years since the creation of the world, the moon and sun circles and epacts" [335, p. 250]. The agreement of this unfinished and self-contradictory chronology with the chronology of Scaliger, which is still accepted today, shows that exactly this chronology, due to Scaliger and his school, served as a basis for the chronological scale of ancient and medieval history we are using today. Figure 131 compares the modern chronology (Scaliger's), the original equinox chronology of Matthew Vlastar, i.e., the chronology of Matthew Vlastar after the correction of one of his two mistakes, namely, the mistake in the rate of the shift of the spring point (note that this causes
the lifetime of Vlastar himself to move to the 6th century A.D., where modern chronology "places" Dionysius the Little) and, finally, the equinox chronology of Matthew Vlastar after the correction of both of his mistakes, i.e., the mistake in the rate of the shift of the spring point and the 6-day mistake in the determination of the contemporary equinox. It can be easily seen that Scaliger's chronology is a "mixture" ofVlastar's original equinox chronology and his equinox chronology with one of the mistakes corrected (compare the second and the third columns in Fig. 131 with the first column). However, Scaliger "specified" all dates, so that they indicated years, months, days,
and sometimes hours (!) (modern tradition indicates only the years of Scaliger's dates, omitting the rest). Along with that, for example, in the case of Nabonassar he specified the date within the interval of time as in the original Vlastar's equinox chronology. He "doubled" Vlastar, both leaving him where he was (according to the original equinox chronology--see the second column in Fig. 131) and turning him into Dionysius the Little (by the "half-corrected" chronology in the third column in Fig. 131). Note that the "completely corrected" equinox chronology of Matthew Vlastar places the most ancient event, the rule of Nabonassar, in the 4th-5th centuries A.D. and gives the interval conforming the above date (the end of the 9th century) for the First Oecumenical Council. But of course, even this "completely corrected" chronology of Vlastar cannot be declared to be close to true unless a thorough investigation is carried out, to say nothing of the "uncorrected" and "half-corrected" versions lying at the basis of the hitherto accepted tradition of Scaliger-Petavius.



APPENDIX 5
The Well-known Babylonian Captivity and the Well-known Avignon
Exile of Papacy
In this book we almost completely omitted the material concerning the parallelism, or parallels between some biblical events and the corresponding events of European history. Nevertheless, after a brief exposition of parallels between the kingdom of Israel (the kingdom of Judah) and the Third Western Roman Empire (respectively, the Third Eastern Roman Empire), we shall supplement this material with one more important parallel. We will discuss here the third basic 1,780- (or 1,810)-year rigid chronological shift, which we call the greco-biblical shift in ancient history. See Fig. 51 (where the value of the shift is equal to 1,838 years) and Fig. 64(2) (where the value of the shift is exactly equal to 1,810 years). The existence of the basic parallelism between the jet (part) from the Second Roman Empire (and also from the Third Roman Empire) and the Roman Empire in the 10-13th cc. A.D. allows us to check the parallelism between the kingdom of Israel (resp. Judah) and the jet (part) from the Roman Empire in the 1013th cc. A.D. One of the basic parallels is shown in Fig. 51. Let us concentrate our attention on the end of this parallel. We confine ourselves to a single example for illustration. It has been found out above that there is a parallel between Frederick II (11961250) and Theodoric (493-497-526). In medieval documents there exists an essential confusion between Frederick I and Frederick II ([232); [232*), V. 1, p. 220). Let us recall: Frederick I Barbarossa (1125-1190) is a Roman emperor (11551190) and a German king (1152-1190); Frederick II (1194-1250) is a Roman emperor (1220-1250) and a German king (1212-1220), king of Sicily (1197-1250) and king of Jerusalem(!) (1229-1250). It turns out that the above parallels between the kingdom of Judah and the Roman Empire in the 10-13th cc. A.D. are confirmed by medieval chronicles.

5) Vitalian (and consequen- 5) Sennacherib is defeated tly Theodoric) is defeated (2 Kings, 19:35)
Here is the medieval description (in a medieval chronicle)of this well-known medieval event (based on the fragment from 2 Chronicles): "And the Lord sent an angel, which cut off all the mightly men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land." (2 Chronicles, 32:21). Such a picture, says F .Gregorovius, was presented by Thomas as he congratulated pope Alexander III with the retreat of Sennacherib (Frederick!), whose army was killed by the Lord. F. Gregorovius says that almost all medieval chroniclers(as they describe the defeat of Frederick) tell about the divine punishment ([44); [44*), V. 4, p. 496, comment 89).
Here is the biblical desription of this well-known (in biblical history) defeat: "And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians am hundred four-score and five thousand; and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned" (2 Kings, 19:35-36). In the left column (i.e., in medieval history) it is assumed today that all these "medieval parallels" are just references to the Bible,which already existed.But probably, the biblical books of Kings were still being written at the time (or even later on).
Gregorovius describes the content of the medieval chronicles in the following way: Rome became the second Jerusalem (!-A. F.) and emperor Frederick became the odious Sennacherib. On August 2 dark clouds broke into a heavy shower over the city, and then a parching heat set in; malaria, which usually threatens with death here in August, had now assumed a character of plague. The pick of the invincible



414 Appendix 5
army perished with ignominious death; horsemen, infantrymen, armour-bearers were taken ill and died, often unexpectedly, when riding or going along the streets ... In 7 days Frederick lost his best heroes ... A lot of noble and ordinary people were taken by death. Rome suffered from plague in the same way ... For many centuries did not the city did not experience so terrible disasters ... The Germans were seized with panic terror: they said that the Lord's punishing hand had struck them because of their attack of the Holy City ... Full of despair, the emperor got under way from his armed camp and set out with the remains of his army in which people were like shadows. On their way he lost no less than 2000 people more ([44*]; V. 4, p. 484). Of course, this "miraculous escape" of Rome from the siege had been (in our opinion) described in the biblical book of Kings. And the fact that medieval chroniclers mention here the obvious parallels with biblical history can be explained from the chronological shifts discovered in our work.
Moving from the left to the right along the biblical chronology we reach to the end of the Judaic kingdom, and we see here the "Babylonian captivity". The parallel (isomorphism) we mentioned above (according to the Global Chronological Diagram) shows that the biblical war with Nebuchadnezzar (whom we have earlier identified with Justinian) is just another version of description of the GTR-war in the middle of the 13th c. A.D. The black triangle on GCD depicting "the war with Nebuchadnezzar and the Sedekiah's captivity" (in the Bible) represents the GTR-war. Since the GTR-war (at least, its basic events) is discovered (according to our results) in the 13th c. A.D., the Babylonian captivity (described in the Bible) should also be at the end of the 13th c. A.D. and at the beginning of the 14th c. A.D. This conclusion (based on GCD) is corroborated by real medieval chronicles. The end of the Judah kingdom matches with 1300 A.D. In the entire Roman history for many centuries only once did the events take place which are identifiable with the biblical Babylonian captivity. This is the well-known "Avignon popes' captivity", which was called "Babylonian captivity" in Middle Ages (!). It turns out that this is exactly the parallel that ensued from our GCD.
S. Lozinsky writes: In 1305 A.D. an insipid, unknown prelate, a Frenchman named Bertrand de Got had become pope Clement V, thus beginning the notorious "Babylonian captivity of papacy" (!-A. F.) ([119], V. 1, p. 112). This election had been held under a pressure from France, and the town Avignon (France-A. F.) was chosen as the new pope's place of permanent residence ([119], V. 1, p. 112). As the archbishop of Bordeaux, he gained the favour of the French king Philip IV, who engineered electing him the pope. He settled (1309) in Avignon, thus beginning the long "captivity" of the papacy. After several hundreds years' residence at Rome, the pope's throne left the city and relocated to France for about 70 years.It returned back to Rome only on January 17, 1376 A.D., i.e., in about 70 years after leaving Italy (and exactly 70 years after 1305 A.D., the first year of Clement's reign) ([74], Table B. XIV, No. 26).

end of the Roman Empire in the 1013th cc. A.D., after the GTR-war in Italy in the 13th c. A.D. The Avignon captivity lasted about 70 years. This event is also unique in the Roman history and in the history of papacy.
Relocation from Rome to Avignon (France)
There is a lot of literature about these two events; both of them were turning points,for the Kingdom of Judah and in the history of Roman Empire and Roman papacy in 10-14th cc. A.D. Let us recall here that the Bible is a religiously coloured source, and consequently this event is considered in the Bible as being extremely important in the history of the Kingdom of Judah. The Bible says: "And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons untils the reign of the kingdom of Persia." (2 Chronicles 36:20). Let us recall that Avignon is located in France, and France was identified (at least in some biblical texts) with PRS = Persia. Moreover, Charles of Anjou (king of Naples and Sicily: 1266-1285), the victor in the GTR-war of the 13th c. A.D. (in Italy) had also come from France (by the way, he was a brother of Louis IX of France). In particular, this fact gives an explanation for "the relocation and the captivity of popes" to no other country but France = PRS ="Persia"(?). The Bible continues: "Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath; to fulfil threescore and ten years." (2 Chronicles 36:21). The chapter in [119] (S. Lozinsky) that describes the "Babylonian captivity" of popes, is titled: "The papacy in captivity of France" ([119]. V. 1, p. 110). A religious source, as the Bible is, of course attached a great importance to this event concerning the fortune of the Roman religion and the centre of papacy. As we mentioned in Part 1 of our book, some medieval authors confirm our parallel calling the Avignon exile of the popes the "Babylonian captivity" and identifying Rome with Jerusalem (see Dante's letter to Henry, Part 1, Section 13.6.2). Of course, such medieval texts seem to the modern commentators (for example to A. K. Dzhivelegov, see [287]) to be "biblical reminescences", but Dante means about his time and his life. S. Lozinsky writes: "In France ... the papacy felt much more safely and comfortably under the king who, in fact, at that time settled the popes ... Contemporaries said that in fact Paris dictated his will to Avignon ... Nicholas from Clemange confirms this fact, calling the Avignon's pope "a slave of slaves of French Princes" ... But the method the French kings (PRS-Persians?-A. F.) used demonstrated clearly that at the moment the papacy is no more useful to the French throne, the popes' Avignon residence will become unnecessary and the "Babylonian captivity" will come to its natural end." ([119], V. 1, p. 12). S. Lozinsky and F. Gregorovius listed the following evidences of medieval documents about Rome in the first half of the 14th c. A.D.



416 Appendix 5
In the exact correspondence with the biblical description of Jerusalem (2 Chronicles), medieval Rome, left without centralized political power, was exposed to desolation and ruin. The papacy's stay at Avignon had sad effect also on popes' affairs in Italy. Some powerful feudal lords and small bourgeois republics tore the popes' region to pieces and annexed all being badly kept in the country "left by its own master" ... Rome filled with beggars, often dying of starvation in the streets and having no shelter (compare with the Bible-A. F.). Many ancient beautiful buildings Rome was so rich in were neglected and even destroyed ([119], V. 1, pp. 134-135). Global civil war had driven popes' region to terrible misery and starvation. Annalists Campi and Blondus say about pope states' towns and villages having become deserted and about disappearance of all peasant property in some deserted districts. ([119], V. 1, p. 140). Ezra's biblical book (which follows 2 Chronicles) tells that in 70 years "people come back" to Jerusalem. The initiative of this return is attributed to the Persian king Cyrus (Ezra 1:1-2). Thus, in exact correspondence with the medieval history,
the return of the pope's throne is connected with France = PRS. The return took
place 4 years before 1380 A.D. This is the first year of French king Charles VI (the Mad, or the Well Beloved) (reign: 1380-1422). Let us note that both "Cyrus" and "Charles" can mean simply "king".
The return to Jerusalem at the 1st year of the Cyrus' reign: "Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia..." (Ezra 1:1).
Persian king Cyrus = CR = Caesar (?)
= "king"
The return to Rome at the 3-4th years before the 1st year of Charles king of France [119].

The main persons of "the return to Jerusalem" are Zerubbabel and Jeshua. They are probably the reflection of the main leader of "the return to Rome" -pope Gregory XI (1370-1378) ([119], V. 1, p. 140). Since this part of the Bible duplicates the Roman chronicles, already incomplete and distorted, the events of "the return" could be copied not only from the original in the beginning of the 14th c. A.D., but also from some other duplicate "moved down" in time. It is impossible not to mention that up to the shift by 333 years down, the beginning of Gregory XI (1370 A.D.) practically coincides with the beginning of Hildebrand's activity in Rome in 1049 A.D.
(because 1370 - 333 = 1047 A.D.). But Hildebrand is closely connected with the names "Jeshua" and "Jesus" (see above), therefore the Jeshua's appearance in Ezra's book (in the description of "the return") is not surprising. The "person number two" of "the return" to Rome in the 14th c. A.D. is the "bandit-cardinal Robert from Geneva" ([119], V. 1, p. 137). He is parallel to the "person number two" (described in the Bible), Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah (Ezra 1:8), who had been the head of the migrants from Babylon to Jerusalem. Robert is called "Geneva's Robert" in the chronicles of the 14th c. A.D., and this name read in the opposite direction might transform into ShShBZR (?). He was the head of the Breton band "hired to maintain an order (during the migration



The Well-known Babylonian Captivity 417
back to Rome-A. F.)" ([119], V. 1, p. 137). The Bible says: "All these (vessels of gold-A. F.) did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem" (Ezra 1:11). Probably, "Zerubbabel" means just "Babylonian king" (Caesar+ Babylon= CSR+ BBL= ZRBBL). After the return of papacy to Rome, a "deep religious crisis" ensued ([119], V. 1, p. 142). Its top was the well-known Constance Council (1414 A.O.) convened not only to put an end to the usurpation of papacy, but also to stop the heresies ([119], V. 1, p. 146). This important medieval event was reflected in the Bible immediately!

418 Appendix 5
Let us recall that in religious literature the Church is often called "the wife" and "the bride". The Bible describes (after the return to Jerusalem) a "great meeting" (council ?), at which the struggle against that leaders and people of Judah who had taken "strange wives" (foreign wives ?) was carried on. This means probably the
struggle against heresies = "strange wives". The Bible attaches a great importance to this meeting (see Ezra). "For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons; so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass" (Ezra 9:2). Ezra (he was the senior priest, see Ezra:9) prays for the liberation of people of Judah from "the strange wives", and then "assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children... then all the men of Judah... Now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do." (Ezra 10:1, 9-12). "And that whosoever would not come within three days, .. . all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away (see corresponding excommunications of this epoch in 14th c. A.D.-A. F.)" (Ezra 10:8). Then the Bible lists those guilty in taking "strange wives". It would be extremely interesting to compare these biblical lists of names with medieval sources telling about heresies and Constance council. The biblical books of Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther form the conclusion of the historical narration of Old Testament, so the chain of the events described therein ends about the beginning of the 14th c. A.D.
