Silver punch-marked coins with deciphered Indus Script hieroglyphs/hypertexts -- Elizabeth Errington (2003) & Durga Prasad (1934)
The Indus Script Cipher continues into historical periods rendering wealth accounting ledgers of scores of mints which minted thousands of silver punch-marked coins. This monograph presents and deciphers hundreds of Indus Script hieroglyphs/hypertexts which continue to be used by Meluhha artisans of mints of janapada-s.
I submit that these thousands of ancient Indian silver coins constitute veritable Rosetta Stones of Indus Script, form, function and meaning conveyed in Indian sprachbund, 'speech union' called Meluhha speech or mleccha vācas.
This is an addendum to:
Indus Script hieroglyphs on 21600 Ancient Indian Silver Coins (1838 from Taxila) are metalwork wealth account ledgers of mints https://tinyurl.com/y2l4qe8t

Supplement, Number XLV, Article 317. Classification and significance of the symbols on the Silver Punch-marked Coins of Ancient India, by Durga Prasad, Pages 5 to 60, Plates 1 to 29
“Mr. Walsh, President of the Council of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society (1919) was the last scholar who contributed something substantial towards the subject. He elaborately described two different hoards of silver-punch-marked coins, of two different types, found in the city of Patna and Bhagalpur District, in the province of Bihar. His observations were
published in the Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, 1919, Vol. V, Part I (the Gorakhpur and Ghoroghat hoards). He noticed that generally there were 5 symbols on the obverse side of the coins groued methodically, which he classified scientically; he also found that the Gorakhpur hoard coins were quite different from those previously published, and considered the coins to be of an early period, but he could not fix their exact time. In this thesis attempt has been made to collect, illustrate, and describe as far as practicable all the symbols which were seen complete on well-preserved silver coins, which could be ascertained by a comparative study of over 4,000 silver punch-marked coins from a dozen different hoards kept in different Indian Museums, private collections of Mr. Srinath Sah of Benares, who obtained them from Ahraura, District Mirzapur, and Captain MFC Martin, RE, President of the Numismatic Society of India, 1929, who obtained them from Swat, Hasanabad, Kosam, Mathura, and other places, to all of whom my thanks are due, and the author’s own collection. Attempt has also been made to revise the list of symbols found on the silver punch-marked coins illustrated and described by Mr. W. Theobald in the JASB, in Vol. LIX, 1890 and Vol. LXX of 1901, by carefully copying the figures from well-preserved coins for the sake of accurate and scientific classification of the coins according to the symbol-groups punched on them, which would be actually helpful in differentiating the various types of different periods and localities, thus providing a key to ascertain the period in which they were minted for currency...Out of 564 illustrated figures some of which are



2
really variations of the same symbols, only half a dozen figures are doubtful...All the coins are thin, broad pieces of round or elliptical shape, the biggest being 1.25”x.9”, the smallest .9”X.85” with an average weight of 42 grains, the heaviest being 43.8, and the lightest 40 grains, hence it can be inferred that their actual weight was 24 Raktika of early days...(the coins) seem to be Puranas of 24 Raktika standard weight of about 44 grains; this theory of a lighter standard-weight of about 24 Raktikas silver-coins is supported by early Sanskrit astronomical texts. Colebrook in his article on Indian Weights and Measures, published in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1801, page 95, has said that Gopala Bhatta, an early author mentions that from the ancient astronomical books it is found that a Dharana was of 24 Raktikas, and he has given a table of weight as follows: 2 yavas (barleys) = 1 Gunja; 3 Gunjas = 1 Balla; 8 Ballas = 1 Dharana. As 2 barleys are equal to 1 Gunja or Raktikas, 1 Dharana contains 24 Raktikas or Rattis. It is clear from this that either at some period or locality silver coins of 24 Raktikas standard weight were current...The Karshapana was also called Dharana, probably meaning a handful of 16 copper Panas from Dhri ‘to hold’. But a more common name was Purana, or ‘the old’, which could only have been imposed upon it after the Greek occupation of the Punjab, which is about the middle of the 2nd century BCE, but on page 20 he said, ‘In the Hindu books they are called Purana, or OLD, a title which vouches for their antiquity. They are mentioned by Manu and Panini, both anterior to Alexander’...(Cunningham) also mentioned that silver was imported in large quantities in this beaten places from Tarshish, and gold was taken in exchange from Ophir, the Saberia of Ptolemy, the Sindhu-Sauvira of ancient India. The coins are all of alloyed silver, which on analysis is found to contain, silver 75 per cent, copper 24.6 per cent with trace of iron and lead 4 per cent.”(8N-12N)
Durga Prasad concludes: “A careful study of illustrations would show many well-defined connecting links between the different group arrangements. It will also be noticed that some of the coins have been obtained from as many as 12 different places situated far apart...There are only two possible explanations of this fat: (1) either the coin belongs to a king whose empire comprised the whole of India even beyond the NW Frontiers, or (2) his coins were so vastly distributed through the country that they are found uipto this after 2,200 or 2,300 years. Whatever be the exact cause, it undoubtedly shows its recognition as a currency in the whole Indian empire of the period, the author leaves these facts for the reader to consider and judge.” (N39)

Monographs of Theobald (1890, 1901) list 342 symbols deployed on punch-marked coins. These symbols also survive on later coinages of Ujjain or Eran or of many janapadas. One view is that early punch-marked coinage in Bharatam is datable to 10th century BCE, predating Lydia's electrum coin of 7th cent. BCE. “The coins to which these notes refer, though presenting neither king’s names, dates of inscription of any sort, are nevertheless very interesting not only from their being the earliest money coined in India, and of a purely indigenous character, but from their being stamped with a number of symbols, some of which we can, with the utmost confidence, declare to have originated in distant lands and inthe remotest antiquity...The coins to which I shall confine my remarks are those to which the term ‘punch -marked’ properly applies. The ‘punch’ used to produce these coins differed from the ordinary dies which subsequently came into use, in that they covered only a portion of the surface of the coin or ‘blank’, and impressed only one, of the many symbols usually seen on their pieces...One thing which is specially striking about most of the symbols representing animals is, the fidelity and spirit with which certain portions of it may be of an animal, or certain attitudes are represented...Man, Woman, the Elephant, Bull, Dog,



96
Rhinoceros,Goat, Hare, Peacock, Turtle, Snake, Fish, Frog, are all recognizable at a glance...First, there is the historical record of Quintus Curtius, who describes the Raja of Taxila (the modern Shahdheri, 20miles north-west from Rawal Pindi) as offering Alexander 80 talents of coined silver (‘signati argenti’). Now what other, except these punch-marked coins could these pieces of coined silver have been? Again, the name by which these coins are spoken of in the Buddhist sutras, about 200 BCE was ‘purana’, which simply signies ‘old’, whence the General argunes that the word ‘old as applied to the indigenous ‘karsha’,was used to distinguish it from the new and more recent issues of the Greeks. Then again a mere comparison of the two classes of coins almost itself suffices to refute the idea of the Indian coins being derived from the Greek. The Greek coins present us with a portrait of the king, with his name and titles in two languages together with a great number and variety of monograms indicating, in many instances where they have been deciphered by the ingenuity and perseverance of General Cunningham and others, the names of the mint cities where the coins were struck, and it is our ignorance of the geographical names of the period that probably has prevented the whole of them receiving their proper attribution; but with the indigenous coins it is far otherwise, as they display neither king’s head, neame, titles or mongrams of any description...It is true that General Cunningham considers that many of these symbols, though not monograms in a strict sense, are nevertheless marks which indicate the mints where the coins were struck or the tribes among whom they were current, and this contention in no wise invalidates the supposition contended for by me either that the majority of them possess an esoteric meaning or have originated in other lands at a period anterior to the ir adoption for the purpose they fulfil on the coins in Hindustan.”
(W. Theobald, 1890, Notes on some of the symbols found on the punch-marked coins of Hindustan, and on their relationship to the archaic symbolism of other races and distant lands, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Bombay Branch (JASB), Part 1. History , Literature etc., Nos. III & IV, 1890, pp. 181 to 184) W. Theobald, Symbols on punch-marked coins of Hindustan (1890,1901).

In 1912 and 1924, Bhir-Mound Taxila Hoards of 1838 Silver Punch-marked coins were found.The Hoards are dated to 317 BCE and 248 BCE based on extraneous cons found in the two hoards -- two Alexander and Philip Aridaeus coins of ca. 317 BCE and a coin of Diodotus of 248 BCE.

In Table H, Walsh provides (in Table H), a comparison between punch-marked coin symbols from, the Taxila hoards and Indus Script hieroglyphs. In Appendix IX Table I, Walsh lists some unique coin symbols which occur with noticeable frequency on the coins.
One variety of Taxila mark signifies specialisation of its mints to produce 'ingots'
muxa 'frog' rebus: muha 'ingot'
Vajra, 'thunderbolt'
Variants:
Six spokes emanating from 'dotted circle' are topped with multiple counts (2 or 3 each) of ligatured hieroglyphs: arrow, loop (with variants of ovals, buds, fish, hour-glass, one-horned young bull). 'vajra, six-angled' is an early Punch-marked coin symbol signifying mint work rebus: vajra 'thunderbolt (weapon).-- ṣaṭkōṇa ʻ hexagonal ʼ RāmatUp. [ṣáṣ -- , kōṇa -- ]Or. chakoṇi ʻ hexagonal ʼ.(CDIAL 12681) Thus, the Taxila mint is also an armoury.
Silver karshapana c. 5th-4th century BCE
Weight: 3.25 gm., Dim: 20 x 27 mm.The four official punch symbols are: 1. Vajra (with arrows and oval ingots) 2. Elephant 3. Spoked wheel PLUS round dot 4. Sun. All four are Indus Script hypertexts.
Sun: arka 'sun's rays' rebus: arka 'copper, gold' eraka 'metal infusion' karibha, ibha
'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'; 3. gota 'round stone, pebble' rebus: goti 'silver' PLUS eraka 'nave of wheel' arā 'spokes' rebus: āra 'brass'.



98
The vajra symbol is a hypertext with 1. dotted circle; radiating
2. three ficus glomerata leaves; 3. three 'Śrivatsa' compositions. Śrivatsa composition is circle PLUS pair of fish-fins joined.
'Śrivatsa' composition
Decipherment:
1. Dotted circle is dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron smelter'. This is derived from two components: 1. dhāī 'wisp of fibre' and 2. vaṭṭa 'round', together rebus: dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron smelter' 2. Two fish fins are joined: dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS khambhaṛā 'fish-fin' Rebus: Ta. kampaṭṭam coinage, coin. Ma. kammaṭṭam, kammiṭṭam coinage,
mint. Ka. kammaṭa id.; kammaṭi a coiner. (DEDR 1236). Thus metalcasters' mint.
Together, 1 and 2 are a Meluhha expression dhā̆ vaḍ kammaṭa 'iron smelter, metalcasters mint'. These are rendered as 3 radials: three: kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. Thus, the reading in Meluhha Indian sprachbund, 'language union' expression is: dhā̆ vaḍ kammaṭa kolimi 'metalcasters' mint and smithy/forge'
Three 'ficus glomerata leaf' radials: kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' PLUS loa 'ficus glomerata' rebus: loh 'copper, metal'. Thus, the expression is: loa kolimi 'metals smithy, forge'.
Together the six radiating radials from the dotted circle constitute
The monograph of Elizabeth Errington is data mining of 21,600 coins from the masterpiece of Gupta and Hardaker. In addition to reviewing 28 published hoards, the monograph covers unpublished material of 854 coins from Kathy White, 837 silver coins from Mir Zakah II in Afghanistan, 46 from Mirzapur (Uttar Pradesh), c. 1500 coins from Vidisha region (Madhya Pradesh). 800 coins collected by Charles Masson from Begram (ancient Alexandra of the Caucasus) and 33 from Wari, on Brahmaputra river in Bangladesh, hoards of Sugh (Haryana), Peshawar, Thatta (near Attock), Bhir, Rair, Bhalna, Taregna, Gorho Ghat (Bihar), Nasthulapur (near Hyderabad), Amaravati, Barwani (3540 coins), Mana, Mangrul, Nevari, Kasrawad, Mirzapur, Malhar (Bilaspur, MP), Varanasi, Kosam, Azamgar (UP), Bahal (Maharashtra), Ai Khanum (Afghanistan), Mahasthana, Baigachcha (Bangladesh).

Plates 18 to 23 are outstanding summaries --exemplars of knowledge discovery through data mining -- prepared by Elizabeth Errington presenting variants of hieroglyphs signified on tens of thousands of Punch-marked coins from all these findspots.
These hieroglyphs are a continuum of Harappa Script hieroglyph tradition of documenting metalwork catalogues on Harappa Script Corpora of over 7000 inscriptions. Thus, the tens of thousands of punch-marked coins should add to the Corpora tens of thousands of inscriptions attesting to the nation's wealth created by Bhāratam Janam.
